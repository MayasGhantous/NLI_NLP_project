  i 'm not picking fights , i just feel the need to call people out on their retarded bullshit , including someone claiming that the jews are to blame for antisemitism amongst muslims . 
  that 's some neo-nazi conspiratard stuff . 
  you said the only reason there is antisemitism amongst muslims in europe is because of israel/palestine . 
  if that were true ( it 's not ) , then would n't that make muslims just as bad as people who blame all muslims for terrorist attacks committed by muslims ? 
  considering most jews have no connection to israel , and european jews are certainly not responsible for the actions of benjamin netanyahu 4000 miles away ? 
   yet you retards ( both amerifats ) `` you 're american !, 
  therefore you 're fat and stupid ! '', 
   i do n't think anyone is racist `` no one is racist ! '', 
   fight intolerance with intolerance and violence with violence !, 
  `` intolerance of intolerance is intolerant !, 
  this sub is intolerant of my ~ ~ opinions ~ ~ jokes ! '', 
  dude you 're a gold mine lol . 
  i 'm saving this thread , shit is great . 
   what has this sub become when you ca n't say anything that does n't explicitly condemn da mudlims  i have n't called anyone racist the stupid ... it 's just too strong . 
  i ca n't handle it . 
  i am not trained to deflect this much stupid . 
  i 'm done . 
  at what point does it get old to lazily call everyone racist against muslims whenever they disagree with your idiotic opinions ? 
  is that ever going to get old ? 
  it 's really , really uninteresting . 
  then you should admit how insanely retarded your original comment was . 
  it 's not that blatant . 
  i 'm talking about the soft bigotry of low expectations , which is ironically racist in and of itself . 
  while native people are regularly slammed for even the tiniest iota of racism , most racism ( event blatant examples ) that comes from muslims is regularly ignored . 
  so you 're agreeing with netanyahu then ? 
  \\  be you \\  say stupid shit and get downvoted to oblivion \\  get called out \\  desperately try to back up and claim it was all jokes \\  moardownvotes.jpg \\  do n't profit, 
  `` how dare you denounce racism coming from muslims !, 
  you racist ! '', 
  found the neo-nazi !, 
  yeah , it 's never the second generation that 's the most radical or anything , you know , except literally every time . 
  was it the israeli-palestine conflict that caused the holocaust too ? 
  or how about simply not tolerating intolerance just because it 's coming from muslims . 
  what the fuck ukraine . 
  it 's awesome if you like piss stained subways and train stations . 
  but they pronounce out `` oot '' , who wants that ? 
  i like how you criticize people who are afraid of islamists as if that 's a ridiculous thing to be worried about - but then when * one * far-right dude attacks someone , you think the fucking apocalypse is imminent . 
  that company definitely should have taken the money . 
  there 's already a better , way cheaper version of that from an american company : https://www.lily.camera/ bad move . 
  but they 're going to be ... hospital drones, 
  50 years ? 
  try 500 years . 
  it makes me sad . 
  iran could easily be the most modern , westernized muslim country in the world , and instead they 're an `` islamic republic '' whose leaders call israel an abomination and chant `` death to america '' . 
  we really dropped the ball on iran . 
  my initial remark was not meant to be asshole-ish , although reading it now it definitely sounds that way . 
  it was more of a joke and a sort-of reference to princess bride . 
  also the thing about `` france is not the continent '' vs. `` france is not a continent '' - once again , not trying to be a dick , just letting you know . 
  when someone switches `` a '' and `` the '' in that context , it 's an easy way to tell they 're not a native speaker . 
  it seems negligible to non-native speakers , but the two have very different meanings to native speakers . 
  anyone , i 'm not trying to be a douche to anyone . 
  i apologize if i came off that way . 
  iranian citizens are quite a bit different from the iranian government . 
  they 're actually not that backwards or primitive of a society , it 's just their shitty revolutionary regime that makes them look bad . 
  and how many of those 10 % got degrees in islamic studies ? 
  supply side jesus looked at them and said , `` with man alone this is impossible , but with enough money all things are possible . '', 
  you :  since france is not the continent , then germany , surely , must be the continent , right ? 
  that 's not being incredulous , this is :  france is not a continent ? 
  no , i do n't believe you . 
  france is definitely a continent . 
  they 're close , but not the same . 
  normally i would n't nitpick an esl person 's english , but since you were being an arrogant asshole i could n't help but be pedantic . 
  then you turn around and call * me * arrogant , thus showing you 're also a hypocrite ; now i do n't feel bad about said pedantries . 
  as for learning romanian , thanks but no thanks . 
  i like linguistics and studying languages and whatnot , but romanian is pretty much useless for anyone outside of eastern europe . 
  ** edit ** : also , another nitpick . 
  you said `` france is not the continent '' and it should be `` france is not ** a ** continent '' . 
  saying `` the continent '' sounds really weird , as if you 're talking about a specific continent and whether france is equivalent to that particular continent . 
  no one would ever say that . 
  `` france is not a continent '' is saying that france is not an example of a continent , i.e. 
  that it 's not a continent at all . 
  just fyi . 
  lol i know what the word means . 
  you said `` the follow up question is the incredulous '' which is a very weird , unnatural thing to say , and it 's not a correct use of the term . 
  to be incredulous would be to refuse to believe that france is not a continent , for example . 
  so despite your arrogance , your english is not very good . 
  considering you 've probably studied english for many years , and are constantly surrounded by it on the internet and on tv , it 's pretty sad that you still ca n't speak it well . 
  i would easily speak a language perfectly if i studied it even half as long as you guys study english . 
  obviously he was n't hitler . 
  i do n't think hitler did so much raping . 
  i wonder what they do with those banners after they 're done filming . 
  do they burn them ? 
  lol, 
  i know it 's a joke xd also i do n't know what you were trying to say , so idk . 
  americans have never heard the word `` schengen '' , and since that 's a top search you can assume this is not dominated by americans . 
  it 's an american company that everyone uses . 
  obviously this is n't dominated by americans because the top search for switzerland is `` schengen '' , and i guarantee you that americans do n't know what that is and would not be searching for it . 
  you 're assuming everyone searches for all the same things , which is not the case . 
  i 'm sure europeans are much more likely to search for `` is [ european country ] **** '' than americans are . 
  why is this our fault ? 
  these are just overall google searches . 
  also `` incredulous '' does not mean what you think it means . 
  `` is germany a continent ? '', 
  well ? 
  is it ?!, 
  regardless , we have no idea what this poll would look like in countries like albania , kosovo , bosnia , etc. 
  because they were n't done there , which is pretty annoying . 
  it makes it seem like the pollsters had an agenda , to prove that europeans are intolerant towards muslims . 
  i bet if you ran those polls in turkey , albania , bosnia , and kosovo , the numbers for atheists and jews would be pretty damn low . 
  what are you saying , that they 're capable of being tolerant , unlike arabs ? 
  get that racist nonsense out of here .
