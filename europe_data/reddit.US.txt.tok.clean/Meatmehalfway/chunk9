  this comment burned my fingers when i up voted it . 
  let 's wipe it clean . 
  give the boys a fresh start . 
  send us some decent mofongo and we 'll call it even . 
  i vote yes !, 
  finally our own european state !, 
  only a matter of time before we take the rest of them . 
  if i ca n't debate them , i 'll insult them . 
  nice . 
  explain . 
  i 've been consistent on my views . 
  us deficit is the lowest in 8 years , unemployment has reached pre-crisis levels , and the dow is approaching one billion . 
  that 's how stimulus works when applied correctly . 
  also , i 'm an independent . 
  i generally dislike public unions , think we should have a conscription to get us in shape , and am generally pro business . 
  on the flip side i am for single payer healthcare and tax payer subsidized state universities . 
  keep using those straw man fallacies because you ca n't debate like an adult . 
  keep your chin up . 
  sanity is always voted to the bottom in this sub . 
  this is a common misconception . 
  the us gdp had nearly doubled before the lead up to the war . 
  in 1933 , the first year of the new deal the gdp was 56.4 billion . 
  in 1940 , the year before the us entered the war , it was over 100 billion . 
  because people have pride . 
  did americans bail during the great depression ? 
  fuck no . 
  we toughed it out , applied stimulus vis a vis the new deal , and rode our shit to victory and the top global economic position . 
  why should greeks leave ? 
  what kind of message does that send the world ? 
  we give up because northern europe is out of their fucking minds ? 
  were you not paying attention to the referendum ? 
  you think they we 're naive ? 
  the youth knew the risks and yet they said a big collective fuck you to the corrupt oligarchy and to a failed economic model that has been consistently debunked . 
  imagine if america had implemented austerity during the great depression ? 
  we 'd be living in fucking match stick houses and you people would be speaking russian or german . 
  or both . 
  thank fuck we are our own sovereign nation . 
  could you imagine listening to these idiots all day long and their stupid ass threats when the whole continent is on unstable footing ? 
  let 's put 99 % of our focus on an economy that is 2 % of our gdp . 
  imagine if our news reported on puerto rico 24/7 making them out to be lazy fucks and coconut drinkers . 
  like we give a fuck . 
  fix it and let 's move on . 
  holy shit . 
  i 'm pretty sure an economic depression can have that effect . 
  if they are building a pipeline to supply russian gas to the eu , then who exactly is russia 's bitch ? 
  i 'm pretty sure all the ez countries used the euro to boost their economies . 
  otherwise , why the hell would they join it ? 
  non-productive investments you say ? 
  [ how about outright theft . 
  ] ( http://www.lepointinternational.com/it/politica/europa/550-the-submarine-deals-that-helped-sink-greece-.html ) but let 's be real . 
  [ that 's just part of the problem . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_evasion_and_corruption_in_greece ) then again , i would n't pay my taxes either if my money was simply going into the pockets of government ministers . 
  of course i would get caught and then i would pay anyways , which is why greece needs its own version of the irs . 
  but let 's get back to your point about unrealistic growth . 
  greece 's economic complexity ranking is pretty low at 43rd . 
  their main exports are refined petroleum , aluminum , and fish . 
  however , if you zoom out here on [ this chart ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/exports ) you 'll see their exports have consistently grown since 2001 , even during the crisis . 
  and they are still ranked higher than powerhouses brazil and australia . 
  and with the addition of gas pipeline projects they are becoming a regional hub for nat gas . 
  i 'll take those one at a time . 
  let 's start with spain . 
  did you somehow forget about their [ 21 billion euro stimulus program ? 
  ] ( http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/latest/spain-unveils-21bn-stimulus-package/story-e6frg90f-1111118166193 ) look at their deficits from 2010 to 2013 [ here ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/government-budget ) . 
  sure looks like austerity to me !!, 
  portugal . 
  [ you do n't say !, 
  ] ( http://www.economywatch.com/economic-stimulus-package/portugal.html ) ok that was a one time thing right ? 
  [ oops ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424127887324235304578441051599031988 ) italy . 
  champions of austerity right ? 
  [ oh dear ] ( https://euobserver.com/economic/28384 ) really though ? 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.economywatch.com/economic-stimulus-package/italy.html ) i 'm afraid so . 
  ireland you say ? 
  blind luck for them ? 
  [ oh ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052702303933704577532781188827936 ) and how about the grand champion of them all ? 
  the king of stimulus ? 
  [ you guessed it !, 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/27/germany-europe ) and that 's not all !, 
  [ how about a global stimulus program for everybody through the ecb ??!!, 
  ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-announces-stimulus-plan-1421931011 ) and that 's for everybody right ? 
  [ nope ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/03/greece-politics-idusl6n0ui0e820150103 ) . 
  that would n't be european now would it ? 
  how is it silly to think they will repay ? 
  they need a restructuring with a partial debt relief , not outright forgiveness . 
  they need the repayments and interest frozen until they are out of the current economic depression . 
  then , you tie repayments directly to gdp . 
  they can not default on the full amount . 
  the eu can not absorb that so easily . 
  it is also stupid to allow that happen on all sides . 
  look greece had something like 16 quarters of economic growth leading up to 2009 . 
  look at this chart : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/gdp now that was with the heavy corruption and tax evasion . 
  imagine what they can do once they reign those in . 
  there is a lot of potential in their economy but the austerity keeps pushing them down onto the mat . 
  by the way , a yes vote would given those same corrupt parties the government back . 
  they would have probably agreed immediately to all reforms without a fight . 
  but then what ? 
  you think they would just be good politicians from here on out ? 
  that they would n't resort to the same nepotism , back door dealings , and out right corruption that they subjected the greek people to for the last 30 years ? 
  syriza is all they have right now . 
  all their hopes for a decent future rest on their shoulders . 
  yes , they have done some stupid shit but in comparison to the alternative , they are angels .
