the people there jsut see it to represent the american rural southern way of life . 
  that 's the way it 's used here in the us south 4/5 times . 
  i 've seen black guys sporting the confederate flag . 
  i was n't saying it 's clear cut . 
  it certainly is n't . 
  however [ this should shed light on the issue at hand ] ( http://www.loc.gov/rr/european/imde/germchro.html ) . 
  germany was subject to an enormous amount of primarily political upheavel in the 1800s . 
  many germans left to the us and other south american nations . 
  hell , i 'm pretty clear-cut european in ancestry and my family tree is basically a dartboard from germany to scandinavia to the british isles . 
  i have no idea what i 'd claim if i had to for `` primary ethnicity '' . 
  probably german or irish ? 
  this is how most in the us would claim an `` ethnicity '' . 
  you 'd look at your family tree and just try to make a best guess estimate on what you 're most of . 
  anyway , from the library of congress link ( above ) german immigrants maintained almost a 8-10 % of us population . 
  germans ( outside of ww1 where many were forced to anglicize and cut ties with anything german ) also did n't face many of the hardships that italians and irish faced as many were political immigrants and were coming from a higher socio-economic background . 
  germans certainly do make up a large % of us ethnicity . 
  it 's not clear cut , though . 
  i was n't trying to imply it was . 
  fair enough . 
  i agree with you on your points . 
  just curious to know what they were . 
  also , i replied [ to another commenter ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jzp88/what_does_it_mean_to_be_european/clgwgy1 ) . 
  there was that division between `` european '' versus `` american '' even in the us 200 years ago . 
  not that i disagreed with him . 
  you are completely correct . 
  i was just curious for his reasoning . 
  the us is socially ( as in legal system and social structure ) probably closest to the uk if a european nation had to be picked . 
  culturally we 're a complete amalgamation of european influences that have morphed into our own . 
  there really is no parallel . 
  ancestrally we 're * mostly * german/italian/irish for people with european ancestry . 
  reading up on the history of new orleans in the early/mid 1800s when the flood of americans came to no to settle after the purchase really sheds light on the matter . 
  also , there has always been a lingering feeling of inferiority from the us in regards to our culture and it was very apparent even in the early 1800s . 
  200 years ago . 
  many of the passages from then apply now . 
  there were prominent french creoles that refused to rent to americans and the americans had to settle in what is now the business district . 
  the architectural stylings are quite evident even when compared to buildings of the same age that the creoles built . 
  very spartan . 
  plain . 
  and after going to new orleans multiple times i 've sparked conversations with europeans that visit there . 
  they 've all iterated it 's a `` uniquely european city '' in the us even though its age is really not much different than charleston/savannah or other well-preserved american cities from the late 1600s/early 1700s . 
  the residual effect of being european for so long ( creoles , or french ancestors , clung to french influences even until the 1900s ) even though the city itself is more spanish than french . 
  anyway , i 've gone on a long diversion to agree with you . 
  i did n't see him claiming himself as czech . 
  he lives and works in the czech republic and therefore has a flag representing his views . 
  is he not allowed to have the perspective of someone living in the czech republic simply because he was n't born there ? 
  just in the interest of debate , why would you extend that classification for most of the `` anglosphere '' but not the us ? 
  because he works/lives in the czech republic ? 
  [ simply the numbers , i will give no commentary . 
  ] ( http://rajsivaraman.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/screen-shot-2012-12-21-at-12-37-50-pm.png?w=766 ), 
  i feel where you 're coming from hammer . 
  baguettes are awesome . 
  fuck the haters . 
  to be frank , the irish in the us had a very rough go of things for a long time and eventually thrived over here . 
  people are proud of where they came from and i guess think that , conversely , * actual * irish would be proud of the ancestors of their kin that have thrived . 
  it 's ignorant but it 's not malicious . 
  people look at atlanta and see it has the same population as ireland . 
  it 's also part of us culture to say `` oh , you 're from atlanta , i know people in buckhead ... do you know them ? '', 
  it 's just part of the `` where are you from , how 's the weather '' . 
  i know a lot is made of it but in the end i guess people just assume that people of irish heritage embracing their ancestors culture ( even if it is somewhat bastardized ) would be accepted in ireland instead of met with malice and contempt . 
  sorry for the rant , i know that this topic is n't what this is for but ffs i do n't want to go to / r/ireland and try to discuss it there . 
  also , i learned a lot about the whole situation when my cousin married an irishman . 
  he got very angry when his in-laws tried to make `` irish fare '' to welcome him . 
  apparently that 's insulting ? 
  okay , so you 're in the market for buying a car ( or house or whatever ) . 
  you do n't want to spend much as you do n't believe in the `` you get what you pay for '' adage . 
  so you go to a very questionable looking used car lot . 
  you see a beat-to-shit car whose maker you do n't recognize . 
  the used car salesman works you and convinces you that it 's a good car . 
  single owner . 
  old lady . 
  only drove it to church and to get groceries . 
  the same old story . 
  but you do n't ignore the warning signs . 
  you do n't heed the adages that simply say `` do n't trust a used car salesman '' . 
  you ignore your friends who bought shitty used cars and had them break down within 3 months as the odometer was rolled back . 
  you ignore everything and think `` i wo n't get ripped off '' . 
  you do n't do your research . 
  the used car salesman is a piece of shit . 
  no denying that . 
  but you 're also culpable * for your own actions . 
  * you get burned on a shitty investment of money ? 
  that 's on you . 
  and the car salesman for taking advantage of an idiot . 
  which is exactly what happened here . 
  in this day and age there are countless stories coming out about `` x person got hacked '' and `` y company got hacked and millions of identifying information accounts were compromised '' . 
  if you do n't practice sound security to at least try to safeguard yourself , you 're culpable . 
  you may not * deserve it * but you do bear * responsibility * . 
  see the difference ? 
  varies by state on a very strict basis . 
  you ca n't say `` paying for college in the us '' without specifying the state . 
  the debate ends there . 
  there are states that are a complete mess and there are states that are very beneficial to their inhabitants . 
  there is no one way to cast judgement on the entire us as there are 50 different states with each having their own independent university system , price points and methods of supplying scholarships and grants . 
  there are private schools that are cheaper than the california public school system , for instance . 
  california is a complete mess . 
  given it 's a large state , there are probably going to be a lot of redditors from california that are being fucked by it . 
  that state is a total mess , i 'll grant you that . 
  there are even jobs that i know of personally ( us south , engineering field ) that will pay off student debt 100 % as a signing bonus . 
  but relaying that is honestly hazardously close to starting a stemjerk so i 'll stop there . 
  also , many private schools will completely pay for a student 's tuition/room/board if their household income is below a certain point .
