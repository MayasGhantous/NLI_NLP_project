  but how else is someone going to be able to move out and completely drink their way through their freshman year and land a 1.7 gpa ? 
  i speak from immediate personal experience . 
  not really . 
  us spending varies on a by-state basis . 
  there are a lot of scholarships * from the state * but those require you to go to an in-state public school . 
  [ georgia , for instance , is a total of $ 900/year ] ( http://osfa.uga.edu/hope.html ) but requires 15 hours/semester and maintaining a 3.0 gpa . 
  other states have similar programs . 
  total out-of pocket for a bachelors will be $ 3,600 . 
  this is just one scholarship . 
  there are plenty of grants and scholarships the student could apply for based on school or major . 
  the us just has n't made any mandates on the * federal level * . 
  i can honestly understand the confusion and a lot of times people trying to talk about differences in states and how each one has different laws concerning abortion , death penalty , education , healthcare , etc is drowned out . 
  of course , all of this goes out if a student insists on going to a private school . 
  if a student from georgia from a middle-class family chooses to go to harvard instead of uga and assumes a $ 240,000 debt instead of $ 3,600 ... well . . that 's on them . 
  uga is a fine school but there is still a bit of a ( dying ) negative stigma of going to a public school instead of private . 
  depends on the state . 
  there are quite a few states that will pay 100 % tuition and allow for other grants/scholarships to compensate for room/board . 
  it all depends on the state the person is from and their willingness to go to an in-state public school . 
  if anything , to be honest , us higher education is 100 % based on the uk system . 
  it was set up to be more of a `` matriculation '' for wealthy families instead of a `` educate the working class population in bulk numbers '' system . 
  but , a lot of things are made of the us system , and i 'm honestly not intending to start a circlejerk here : * people get a worthless degree . 
  and this is n't entirely their fault . 
  many parents and counselors will advise them to `` study what makes them happy '' . 
  well , what makes them * happy * wo n't necessarily make them employed . 
  this leads to : * people with expensive and ultimately worthless degrees . 
  everyone is pretty much expected to go to college . 
  someone posted on / r/dataisbeautiful the % of college educated people in 1970 to now . 
  it 's insane how high the % has gotten . 
  combine that with an archaic higher education system and you get : * over-inflation and devaluation of college education . 
  unless you 're in a high demand field , your degree is ultimately worthless without a masters . 
  which leads to more money being spent . 
  additionally , there is still something of a negative stigma of going to a `` public school '' where tuition and room/board is significantly less than a private school . 
  people getting online and whining about how worthless and expensive their degrees are are n't doing themselves or anyone wishing to get an objective opinion any good without saying where they went and what they majored in . 
  there is a pressure for a good student in georgia , for instance , to go to harvard if they 're accepted instead of going the in-state public school . 
  uga , in this instance , is n't as good as harvard but it is a very high quality school . 
  an employable degree ( not stem , but anything in demand ) from uga is better than an unemployable degree from harvard . 
  for instance , in georgia a good high-school student can effectively go to school at the university of georgia for free . 
  all tuition paid for . 
  my cousin went to uga and between the hope scholarship and other grants/scholarships she got out with a degree in economics for free ( lived off-campus with 3 other students and paid < $ 6k in total rent over her entire 4 years ) . 
  she 's now making $ 75k/year in atlanta ( equivalent to $ 171k/year in nyc or $ 102k/year in la ) as an accountant and just turned 30 . 
  edit : also , she has a full-ride medical insurance and just had a kid for absolutely no money out of pocket thanks to her enrollment in a [ pre-natal program ] ( http://www.bcbsga.com/wps/portal/chpmemberbcbsga?content_path=shared/noapplication/healthinformation/livinghealthy/womenhealth/pw_ad033237.htm&amp;label=prenatal%20program ) . 
  so the story about the us education system is very very very dependent on where you 're from ( most of these scholarships are state-based , not federal ) and how aggressive you are about applying for grants and scholarships . 
  i know it 's a trope but you ca n't compare a student in california to one in new york to one in georgia . 
  completely different state-based high school and secondary education systems and benefits . 
  tennessee , another `` back woods hillbilly redneck '' state just instituted a system where all students , regardless of gpa , can go to a community college and feed into 4-year public schools similarly to georgia . 
  this is a great system as it allows people who might have fucked around in high school until they got to their sr year and did n't graduate with a 3.0 gpa . 
  the us is changing , but the change is at the state level ... not federal . 
  just clarifying . 
  and i apologize for going full-bore against the circle-jerk . 
   opinions should n't be discussed that 's a very bleak saying . 
  is that something rooted in central/eastern europe ? 
  i only ask because my brother-in-law married a girl from belarus and , when asked what her opinion on something ( was where to eat , of all things ) she said `` opinions are for children '' . 
  but she 's a * very * reserved person also . 
  very good baker . 
  i threw `` o gustach si\u0119 nie dyskutuje '' and got `` the taste is not discussed '' and thew `` de gustibus non disputandum est '' and got `` not that type of dispute '' . 
  what do each mean ? 
  is google translate off ? 
  i kind of want to throw `` the taste is not discussed '' randomly out in a conversation and give a secretive head nod to really throw someone off . 
  the bbc documentary , * auschwitz : the nazis and ` the final solution ' * is an incredibly chilling telling of the hows and the whys the nazis did everything . 
  it does n't cut any corners either . 
  it is n't graphic or anything , only what you 'd expect out of a holocaust documentary but the most chilling aspect is how methodical the nazis were in creating industrial genocide . 
  of course , bbcs use of handel 's sarabande does n't help at all . 
  well , those 2 could go hand in hand when we 're talking about the era in which vlad tepes lived . 
   bad mouthing an officer this is usually where it starts . 
  i 've been drunk quite literally hundreds of times in public in the us . 
  i 've been stopped once because the officer was afraid i was going to be unable to keep my dumbass on the sidewalk . 
  basically , he did n't want me to fall into traffic . 
  every other time pretty much i 've sauntered past a cop and they did n't care . 
  most do n't want to be there doing babysitting duty on a friday night and wo n't stop anyone as it 's just more paperwork and other shit to deal with . 
  they do n't really get anything out of stopping a mid-20s drunk fool . 
  the only problem is if you have an open container or are obviously belligerent . 
  various cities and states within the us have open laws on this . 
  some allow for open container consumption if you 're stationary . 
  some allow for open consumption within an area ( i.e. 
  french quarter in new orleans ) but only if you have it contained within a plastic cup . 
  each city/state is different . 
  there are no `` national laws '' . 
  being drunk and belligerent is a sure-fire way to end up in the drunk tank to cool off . 
  most cops will use that to ensure you do n't start a fight you ca n't finish and end up in the er or something along those lines . 
  i will say that i am very wary of * what * i say and * how * i say it to a cop . 
  i know they * can * and likely * will * abuse their power if given the chance . 
  i have my own problems with cops and do think their ability to power trip on someone is a problem ... but again it 's something a vast majority of cops do n't tolerate . 
  pretty sure tfw is that feel when . 
  but then your username and i 'm not sure what to think . 
  carry on then . 
  well , actually , you were almost hitting on something that is n't just `` lolfat america '' but is actually digging into the issue . 
  food here is actually categorized as masculine and feminine . 
  there are commercials of burly men with beards who look like they wrestle alligators or bears for a living . 
  what do they eat ? 
  a double hamburger with cheese/bacon and some hfcs bbq sauce to boot . 
  manly foods are steaks , burgers , big sandwiches , etc. 
  it 's disgusting and it 's glamorized as masculine . 
  eating healthy ( i.e. 
  salads , soups , fish ) are usually stereotyped as feminine food . 
  so if that was what you were going for , honestly , you hit on a pretty sophisticated joke about how food in the us is portrayed . 
   homophobia in the south and rural us . 
  statement about homosexuality in the us , contains only anecdotes : * friend got married to her long-time fiance in a very `` rednecky '' alabama state . 
  the town is very country but it 's close to a progressive city with a lot of regional , national and international transplants . 
  like austin , but smaller . 
  * girl getting married comes from a very `` country '' family .
