  she works at a coffee place and invited her co-worker ( also a mutual friend of mine ) who is openly gay . 
  he came with his date who is his boyfriend . 
  they were n't over-the-top affectionate but were on par with most couples . 
  holding hands , smiling at each other , etc. 
  it 's obvious they 're gay . 
  * this was in a southern baptist church that had been around since the early 1800s . 
  deep roots in a rural community . 
  openly gay couple in a church for wedding and reception . 
  nobody cared . 
  they got some looks ... sure . 
  they did n't get lynched . 
  and that 's a step forward from 50-100 years ago for sure . 
  that would have * never ever * happened in a rural southern town 100 years ago . 
  am i missing a joke here ? 
  is the us known for femininity ? 
  i get the `` food = us = fat '' thing , if that 's what you 're going for . 
  in the interest of not starting a random fight over someone 's nationality ... / u/poems _ and_money is not american , at least not according to his [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/2bs3en/college_dropout_thinking_of_becoming_someone_in/ ) about 2 weeks ago . 
  he/she identifies themselves as eastern/northern european . 
  i mean ... 
  i 'm sure the us could be cornering the world on manufacturing brooms and shirts but those are honestly best done by nations that are trying to build up their industries . 
  and the dude that you i 'm fairly certain is either an idiot or a troll . 
  point being no nation that really can provide a voice to counter israel here is really above any level of criticism . 
  whataboutism is n't a good counter . 
  the best person to weigh in on the moral and societal implications of drinking would be a recovering alcoholic ... not the clean-image right-wing christian that has never had anything to drink . 
  if that makes any sense . 
  why are you arguing with me ? 
  i provided a link to which industries saw huge declines and those are all of the basic industries that have been getting phased out for decades . 
  saying `` manufacturing in the us is overall down '' might be true simply because the us is n't churning out textiles because that is seen as low-skill , low-wage manufacturing . 
  us ( as germany and france do as well ) favors tech and aerospace manufacturing . 
  uk and us are world-leaders in jet turbine manufacturing . 
  us and france are world leaders in airliners , etc. 
  those saw increases . 
  those require huge skill , have very very * very * low tolerances . 
  shirts , shoes , etc do n't require the skill and many are fabricated . 
  those are the industries that went overseas not just in the us but other sophisticated manufacturing nations . 
  as others have said in relation to german/uk/french manufacturing ... you wo n't see those in wal-mart or tesco . 
   israel is no better than america , ukraine or any other nation that kills civilians with artillery . 
  so basically every nation in the world ? 
  i was just waiting for your jab at the us , did n't disappoint me . 
  [ this is the graphic you 're looking for , at the bottom . 
  ] ( http://trade.gov/manufactureamerica/build/groups/public/@tg_mana/documents/webcontent/tg_mana_003017.pdf ) the us lost huge amounts of leather/wood/textiles and other such manufacturing . 
  guess where those went ? 
  it completely threw me for a loop . 
  i usually will tailor it for my audience like you . 
  this is weird . 
  you use lbs for weight but cm for height . 
  i know there are some nations out there that use imperial for some designations and metric for others . 
  i 've come across this playing some flight games with some folks from canada . 
  they use mph for speed but km for altitude and feet for distance . 
  it makes no sense to me . 
  is that mix something only you do or only something you did in this instance ? 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  `` we 're looking for an assailant who is 1.9 m and about 95kg . 
  we better start looking for tall and stoutly built women , to be fair . '', 
  us industrial contributions to the ussr were an incredibly vital * stop-gap * . 
  the soviets had many of their factories overrun and destroyed in the initial german push . 
  it was n't all us , but to use soviet production numbers from 43-45 is a bit of a fallacy because the argument being presented is the soviets would have never made it to '43 without us/uk contributions and without the uk forcing the germans to keep a large force in france and north africa . 
  with the mediterranean and na , you have to especially keep note of the number of aircraft/tanks/trucks / etc that the germans had there . 
  i 'm on here making this argument all the time . 
  britain ( well , commonwealth ) stood alone for almost a full year ( fall of france to barbarossa ) . 
  people dont ' give the brits credit for maintaining majority control of the atlantic and kicking the germans/italians around in the mediterranean and north africa . 
  i think it 's because people are afraid of being labeled a `` nationalist '' for iterating historically relevant facts in a discussion . 
  regardless , point remains in that if britain had lost the battle of britain and germany successfully invades with sea lion ... ww2 does n't even start off like it did . 
  britain did n't lose the most people , or get it 's cities razed to the ground nor did it win by sheer industrial might ... but it did have the most vital contribution and that 's by keeping a stiff upper lip and not giving in . 
  do n't do that to yourself . 
  the one thing that defeated france in 1940 was a lack of radios . 
  it also suffered from an out-dated organizational structure ( that unfortunately also plagued the early 40s us army ) but as far as training and equipment go , the french military was top-notch . 
  i 've heard the saying that the italian troops themselves were top notch but very poorly equipped and led ( reflects organizational structure also ) . 
  in a way , it 's like this : the world is represented by runners . 
  in 1900 all of the nations are properly kitted and in a somewhat tight formation but the us is already pulling ahead . 
  germany/uk/france / ussr are quite close to one another and it stays this way just about up to 1939 . 
  the us is ahead but not by a significant version ( estimates are around 10 % higher than germany/ussr and ~ 15 % higher than uk ) . 
  ww2 comes by and effectively all runners lose their shoes in 1945 . 
  the us throws thumbtacks down and then keeps pacing out . 
  one thing to note is the us economy took 10 years to recover to 1929 levels ( great depression ) but another 10 years after 1940 to effectively * triple itself * . 
  it 's hard to wrap one 's head around the inordinate industrial capacity of the us and how insane the resource pool it would require to manufacture the goods it did . 
  here 's something : [ in dec 1941 the us navy had 790 ships . 
  in august of '45 it had almost 6,800 . 
  ] ( http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org9-4.htm#1945 ) that 's unreal . 
  225 major vessels ( destroyers , cruisers , battleships , carriers ) to * 833 * . 
  edit : to further put that into perspective , a destroyer ( 2,500 tons usually ) is almost 85 standard tanks ( 30 tons each ) . 
  the us produced at least 17,000 tanks with the destroyers alone ( pre-war 171 to post-war 377 does n't account for losses sustained from 41-45 just force numbers total ) . 
  i 'd have to say that one of my favorites was the north african campaign in cod 2 i think it was . 
  you 're arguing with a 1 month old account with -466 comment karma . 
  here there be ~ ~ dragons ~ ~ trolls . 
  the sad thing is this guy gets upvotes . 
  just take a gander at his post history . 
  he 's a devoted troll , i 'll give him that . 
  or her . 
  i do n't want to be a sexist ameritard . 
  pretty much . 
  the abrams displays the innate american knack to perform technological appropriation . 
  sure , we innovate stuff but if an ally has something better ? 
  it 's ours now too . 
  speaking strictly as an american : no . 
  the us and europe have a very tight and codependent relationship ( tech , economy , military , etc ) but one in which neither side dominates in the least . 
  roquefort is definitely a very aromatic cheese . 
  and munster . 
  i keep forgetting munster is french , not from m\u00fcnster . 
  next date i go on , i 'm smearing myself with roquefort and munster .
