  this will probably shed some light on it but this map is by a guy named yanko tsvetkov and it 's satirical .

  i 'm american and i knew about kalinigrad . 
  should i not have ? 
  forgive my ignorance but i 'm not familiar with liga.net . 
  is it reliable ? 
  what are the sources for these reports ? 
  [ this is the latest i had heard on the matter . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/23/us-ukraine-crisis-idusbrea4m05420140523 ), 
  i do . 
  my dad and my sister did . 
  a couple of my friends also did . 
  i guess due to my rather pedestrian clothing style i stood out as not being a continental european and was n't frequently asked where i was from but i was asked . 
  i 'd just reply that i was from canada and would usually get a `` canada 's nice '' and that was that . 
  and i probably could have said i was from the us and nothing would have happened but in the off chance that i come across a combative person i 'd rather just avoid it because i traveled to experience another culture , not have my own shoved in my face or start a debate about decisions us leaders have made . 
  this is interesting . 
  one of my good friend 's mom is from england and she refers to them as `` continentals '' . 
  is that an archaic term ? 
  i 'll be honest here : when i go overseas , i go as a canadian . 
  my dad and my sister also traveled as canadians when they went overseas ( spain/france/germany ) . 
  in fact , i know of a lot of americans that do this . 
  it just de-complicates things . 
  there are definitely people who have their issues with america and there are n't many people that take issue with canada . 
  when you spend the amount of money to travel overseas , you do n't want to be harassed for your nationality . 
  i never had issue with people speaking english as most people ( yes , even pierre the snobby french waiter :p ) * wanted * to speak english . 
  my wife wanted to practice her french but found more people wanting to speak english as i guess a bulk of their english was written ( likely internet ) and they wanted to work on their dialect and accent i guess . 
  that pretty much leaves the loud ones as the * obvious * americans . 
  i 've been shot 4 times and all of them were by cops . 
  hell , i got shot by a cop on my way in to work today for not wearing a seatbelt . 
  luckily the bullet hit another bullet that was in my shoulder because our medical system could n't treat me so i did n't suffer any damage . 
  i just got issued a ticket for $ 25,000 for `` failure to prevent a police officer from discharging his firearm '' . 
  all in all , it 's not a bad place to live . 
  [ and this is still in the works . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/united-states/ ) there is definitely vested interest across the pond for the eu to remain in place . 
  while some like to paint there to be a schism between the us and eu forming ( excuse my usage of eu . . 
  i use it as both europe and the eu proper ) the us and the eu are intrinsically tied to one another . 
  then why are you here ? 
  looks to me like you were looking for an echo chamber and did n't find one . 
  then , when asked to back up your original statements you did n't have anything of substance so now you 're pulling the `` i do n't care about arguing online '' . 
  a website and a sub-forum of said website that is created for discussion of issues , particularly of european ones , seems like a bad place to go and not care about discussions/arguments . 
   1815-1914 even then you had the crimean , austro-prussian and franco-prussian wars . 
  those were mostly in the 1850s/1860s so i guess if you went from 1815-1849 and then 1870-1914 you 'd have something . 
   only when she was revealed as a target did this become an issue . 
  see also : dianne feinstein . 
  i 've heard that joke exactly once and it was in `` the breakup '' which is a comedy so it 's not supposed to be something to take to heart . 
  i have heard a lot of stereotypes about poland ( mostly through the internet so the source is n't determined ) concerning stealing cars/etc . 
  we have it here in the us . 
  it 's quite common , actually . 
  and dubliner cheese ( also by kerrygold ) . 
  it was the right decision , to be honest . 
  had they resisted ... they would have still fallen . 
  it was clear that the germans were simply superior in terms of tactics and how their equipment facilitated that . 
  radios in tanks and utilizing aircraft in one swift attack before the radio-less french could mobilize is the key . 
  they were outgunned and they knew it . 
  what would resistance have gotten them ? 
  the same outcome , although likely only delayed by a couple of months and paris would have been destroyed . 
  hundreds of thousands or more would have died ... not to mention the possibility that priceless art and other artifacts of culture would have been destroyed . 
  the soviets had something in their hip pocket ( soviet winter ) that was a cause for them to resist . 
  the french had no such debilitating weather at their back . 
  they were alone and folded . 
  the us and canada could be * huge beneficiaries * if russia yokels their way out of the european natural gas cash cow . 
  hey , 2 outta 3 ai n't bad . 
  the source for the graphic is actually from spring 2007 . 
  the article itself was written in 2010 . 
  i 'm under the impression that 2007 is when the spike actually occurred so taking a poll in the spring of that year would n't be a good representation . 
  what are the `` on the ground '' opinions of folks in here ? 
  ugh , fucking french putting / r/france in french so i ca n't lurk . 
  ca n't you guys put it in american ? 
  :p ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ light-hearted ^ ^ ^ joke . 
  just letting you know that in the us it 's not even close to a discussion point . 
  spain and greece are talked about as are austerity measures ( well , were in most cases ) . 
  if i honestly went off of the things i 've garnered through us media i 'd say france has one of the stronger economies within the eu ( which it does ) . 
  it just is n't talked about much in the us . 
  however , when you go on reddit , it 's talked about more . 
  edit : especially in / r/europe . 
  so that 's why there are us americans ( nod to germans there ) asking / r/europe , which is normally a rational place , to glean information about it as , like you said , many media sources could have their biases . 
  just do n't succumb to the `` knee jerk flair ad hominem '' syndrome . 
  i can honestly assure you that within us media i have n't heard , nor seen , a single word about the french economy . 
  ignorance of the law among a populace is a very quick and easy way for a policing body to infringe on rights . 
  though this does n't give much information , this is 100 % correct . 
  laws governing firarms in the us vary not only by state but also city/county . 
  this should n't be downvoted ... even if fwendly did n't give much supporting information . 
  i live in the us south . 
  i recently bought a firearm in this us state ( wo n't go into specifics but it has a reputation as a `` redneck '' state ) at a pawn shop . 
  i had to have a federal-level background check as well as the firearm itself was fired by the manufacturer and the spent casing was turned into the atf ( federal agency for alcohol/tobacco/firearms ) so spent casings in the future could be recognized ( the firing pin leaves a unique signature ) . 
  additionally the firearm is registered and licensed in my name . 
  you need to remember that there are ( even drastically ) different laws between states and even cities within the us . 
  so chalk my feedback in the opposing column among your us friends . 
  i 'm a friend , right ? 
  we 're friends now , like it or not . 
  i 'm a proponent of the castle doctrine and i adamantly agree with you here . 
  this guy took it to the next level . 
  just because the crime happened on his property and inside his garage does n't change anything to me .
