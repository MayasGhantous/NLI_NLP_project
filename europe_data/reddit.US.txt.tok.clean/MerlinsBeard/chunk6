  ] ( http://www.nato.int/docu/logi-en/1997/lo-02d.gif ) so , he is n't * the commander of nato * ... he 's simply the commander of * military assets * in europe that fall under nato chain-of-command . 
  it 's worded wrong by the author , not op . 
  edit : and with that said , i ca n't for the life of me figure out why he 's engaging the press form a position of obvious power during a very tenuous situation . 
  let due process be due process . 
  ukraine * is not a nato asset . 
  * nato , and especially the us , has no responsibility to defending them ... and russia knows that . 
  the second russia steps foot ( which they would n't do ) in a nato asset , you can run your mouth about what people above you in your coc should be doing . 
  just my take . 
  this just keeps getting worse and worse , but really to nobody 's surprise . 
  it 's a felony to open a piece of mail here in the us ... but the nsa felt it was totally okay to exploit bugs and vulnerabilities in a dragnet that involved countless completely innocent civilians in a quest to know everything about everyone . 
  that 's okay though . 
  break in and find out what i ordered from amazon and read my e-mails . 
  that 's completely fine . 
  as an american , i feel complete shame . 
  we had the utter feeling of vulnerability from 9/11 used against us to slipstream damaging legislation like the patriot act . 
  if you opposed it , you were shunned as if this was a mccarthyism . 
  i will say that the truth will out . 
  hopefully , and i 'm being hopeful here , the judiciary branch of the us government can reign this in . 
  intelligence agencies should not be given a `` free reign '' to operate . 
  this has to end . 
  i honestly thought the `` queen 's english '' was more than just a certain accent , i thought it carried along with it using certain phrases while seeing `` common tongue '' as filthy and disgusting . 
  the way i was using it was to imply that `` queen 's english '' was the pinnacle of prim/proper english amongst all vernaculars . 
  in ways , `` high society '' us english is * sort of * like `` queen 's english '' i suppose . 
  the high society folks are the `` old money '' now that have had family wealth for multiple generations . 
  many of these were the types that envied/emulated european culture and sent their kids to school abroad . 
  these types highly valued their lineage and are the source of why many americans seek to discover their lineage . 
  the old trope is the `` a wiltmore ? 
  of the hartford wiltmores ? '', 
  i 've digressed . 
  yadilohtruc was using a figurative `` you '' , not a literal `` you '' . 
  it 's common to phrase things like this , at least in american english . 
  i 'm not sure how proper it is for the queens english or if canadians do this as well . 
  it 's like when a person from the us is speaking on behalf of the us government ... they would use `` we do this '' instead of `` the us government and specifically the congress/senate/judiciary / executive branch will do this '' . 
  any commonwealth english speakers want to weigh in ? 
  i 've never actually heard an opinion from the other side of the pond or the frozen north on this , i 'd be interested to see . 
  its the same way with the us . 
  louisiana , new york , montana , etc all have different cultures . 
  by and large the `` typical '' american and `` typical '' canadian are n't that different . 
  especially when you consider 35 % of canada 's population live in only the vancouver and toronto metro areas ... and i 'd say those 2 areas are a similar culture that you 'd find in chicago , buffalo or seattle . 
  there just is n't much `` culture shock '' when visiting most of canada from the us or vice-versa . 
  of course , there will be areas that are definitely alien to one group or another but those do n't represent the predominate national cultures . 
  and free nutella . 
  do n't forget the nutella . 
  europeans like nutella ... right ? 
   many want to see the european union integrate more so it removes itself from american hegemony . 
  i would n't say * many * . 
  there is definitely a dissenting voice here but i would not say that is the majority opinion . 
  i would say most europeans are * concerned * with the information that has come out about the nsa but the rational ones realize their own governments are by and large culpubable as well . 
  about the same % of europeans want eu and us split as americans want to see us/eu to split . 
  the current eu/us/canada / aus/nz/sk / japan sphere is definitely for the betterment of everyone within it ... without a doubt . 
  in order for china to really integrate in the us/european sphere they need to put to rest their support of north korea , push for korean unification , let go of taiwan and bury the hatchet with japan over ww2 and their disputed territories . 
  i 'm not sure china is in a position to do those things . 
  of course , siding with russia in a `` go one way or another '' would cost china far more . 
  like you said , they 'll try to stay neutral for as long as they can . 
  but that 's what bloodysneeze does n't realize . 
  nato membership and trade negotiations are keys to us internal prosperity . 
  exactly . 
  by charter any nato ally is the same as any other nato ally . 
  if estonia is attacked , the us/uk/france / germany/etc are * all attacked . 
   there are many canadians that americans do n't even know are actually canadian . 
  you mean to tell me my friends could * be canadian * and i might not even know ? 
  how deep does this rabbit-hole go ?!? 
  relax , you should n't be offended by this . 
  pbs has had photo exposes like this for the us . 
  it showed photos of the us during the late 1800s/early 1900s turn of the century with the same narrative . 
  however , it was more difficult to how the us in this aspect and the photos were showing just daily life . 
  places like boston , new york city , new orleans , chicago , etc. 
  pbs has also shown the `` rust belt '' of the us that showed detroit , pittsburgh , cleveland and other such places in their heyday in a `` what is now , and what it used to be . 
  if anything the expose pbs did on detroit was more insulting because it showed a run-down opera building , a run-down train terminal in their prime and they were beautiful . 
  now they 're abandoned and covered in graffiti and trash ( make a joke about the us here , if you want ) . 
  the undertone is that many parts of europe were devastated in ww1 and then ww2 and * chose * to rebuild anew in the form of the old instead of `` commercialist cheap shit '' . 
  it shows how europe honors it 's past and culture . 
  there should be no offense here , unless you 're looking for pithy reasons to be offended . 
  it does make it odd in the us where popular shows like modern family ( often is rated among the top scripted tv shows in the us among 18-49 demographic ) who have a gay couple ( and one of the actors is gay irl and a vocal advocate ) and said couple is fairly effeminate . 
  in the show , they perpetrate many of the `` stereotypes '' of gay men , through a somewhat sarcastic tone but it 's apparent none-the-less . 
  they make jokes about gay men being well dressed and well groomed . 
  they make jokes about gay men being effeminate and catty . 
  wires can quite easily get crossed . 
  it 's a funny show and i feel it does well to bring to light many issues under the guise of comedy . 
  regardless , it does represent some cultural undertones about `` being gay in the us '' . 
  on what basis ? 
  i quite * literally * just said i was n't saying one was more diverse than the other . 
  i was simply saying that there seem to be multiple ( and acceptable ) definitions floating around . 
  i think a part of it is how `` diversity '' is defined . 
  and in each definition , neither is really wrong . 
  i see examples that many europeans are giving as examples based on cultural differences and more specifically political differences . 
  i 'm honestly not sure how most europeans would instantly associate with `` diverse '' but that does seem to be the overriding definition here , by people tagged with european flags . 
  it 's not terribly scientific , i admit . 
  when most americans are asked about `` diversity '' they will reference racial diversity . 
  just google for `` diverse workforce '' . 
  and that is how americans will reference it as that 's how it 's mostly used in american vernacular . 
  so to me , it 's just a difference in regional application of a word . 
  edit : i 'm not making a stance that the us is more diverse than europe or vice-versa . 
  i 'm simply stating that i do n't even think the usage of `` diversity '' is clearly defined in this example . 
  to me , europe and the us are both completely diverse and the topic is honestly pretty asinine to get upset about ( not that i think you are ) but is interesting to discuss . 
  5 % is a lot when you consider it 's against a $ 300,000 house and is compounding over 30 years . 
  you end up paying $ 576,000 effective for the house over the 30 years if you have the loan for the entire term . 
  however , that 's just how lending works . 
  5 % is definitely low for a mortgage but it 's depressing when you think about how much is just wasted money . 
  and it 's kind of convoluted .
