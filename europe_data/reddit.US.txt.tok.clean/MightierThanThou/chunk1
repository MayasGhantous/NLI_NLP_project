you 're welcome . 
  i 'm not personally helping out but i 'm glad my country can help your country . 
  if anyone on the planet has any right to be wary of russia , it 's you guys . 
  but you need to convince your friends in western europe to do some of the work , too . 
  since they have convenient geography , isolated from russia , a lot of them simply do n't care or do n't understand why poles , romanians , and czechs would be concerned about russia . 
  it 's very obtuse . 
  the germans and french especially need to snap out of it and pull their weight . 
  it 's a little ridiculous that 70 years after wwii ended , the us still needs to step up in situations like this . 
  poland has an excuse and contributes as much as it logically should contribute given its size , but france and germany do not . 
  in fact , a lot of them would consider the us to be militaristic and imperalistic for shoring up poland 's defenses . 
  it 's pretty funny how you 're not romanian , and ostensibly do n't enjoy their cheap and fast internet speeds wherever you are , but you still see romania having great internet as way that you can personally bash the us . 
  everything is zero sum to you . 
  bashing the us is waaay too important to you . 
  it 's incredible that the us having relatively bad internet service gives you so much joy . 
  your anti-americanism is fiendish and obsessive . 
  imagine if there was an article about japan winning an international wrestling contest , and the us was in say ... 10th place , but the only thing americans cared about was that romania did n't win . 
  `` yeah for japan , meanwhile romania is in 17th place . 
  hahahaha ! '' . 
  you 'd find that to be a little pathetic , right ? 
  well that 's what you 're doing , except the fact that the us is the target of your gloating flips a switch in your head and you think it 's ok , because anti-americanism has such prominence and importance in your world view . 
   why ca n't europe defend itself without the us ? 
  all of the military forces of the entire eu combined only have [ 10 % ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20140826172028/http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4296.pdf ) of the capability that the us military possesses . 
  only [ 2.7 % ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/10/eu.military ) of european troops are trained and equipped to a sufficient degree to be deployed in combat . 
  the germans have [ literally had to use broomsticks ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/02/19/germanys-army-is-so-under-equipped-that-it-used-broomsticks-instead-of-machine-guns/ ) in place of machine guns and [ only 8 of their 109 eurofighters are operational . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11057330/german-fighter-jets-unable-to-fly-and-mechanics-forced-to-borrow-spare-parts-claims-magazine.html ) this would be hilarious if it were n't dangerous . 
  [ europe depends on the us for defense and to protect their interests ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/10013197/america-our-great-protector-is-looking-the-other-way.html ) some examples . 
  in the 90 's the western world intervened to stop a supposed genocide in the balkans . 
  there was basically a complete consensus that we needed to stop the serbs . 
  despite the fact that pretty much all of western europe was on board , the [ us did basically all of the work ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20140826172028/http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4296.pdf ) . 
  the us provided almost all the intelligence , command and control , and heavy firepower/air strikes . 
  some people may think that things have changed since then , but the recent [ western intervention in libya showed again that europe depends on the us militarily ] ( https://euobserver.com/defence/115650 ) . 
  military capability is n't perfectly proportionate to military spending . 
  the reason europe ca n't defend itself without the us is because they 've become complacent and have exploited the fact that the us underwrites their security , so they can spend the money they save on other things . 
  the western european nato members do this , but not poland . 
  poland has a better grasp on potential threats , because of their proximity to russia . 
  people and weapons are cheaper to buy in russia than they are in the uk . 
  military capability is n't always perfectly proportionate to military spending . 
  one of the biggest reasons i can not in good conscience support trump , even though clinton is a breathtakingly corrupt she-devil who makes my skin crawl , is that trump 's comments so far indicate that he will abandon our european allies , like poland . 
  it 's hard to take trump seriously because he says a lot of crazy shit all the time , but this seems to be one of his convictions , that russia is strong and therefore should be given a free pass as long as they do n't mess with the us directly . 
  not having it . 
  it 's not only callous to think the way trump does , but it 's not actually a good thing * for the us * to withdraw support from our allies . 
  we 'd save a small amount of money , but we 'd only embolden and strengthen russia to oppose our interests elsewhere in the future . 
  appeasing dictators never works . 
  russia under its current leadership is dangerous and if we give them an inch they 'll take a mile . 
  also , not to get mushy , but poland and other eastern europeans have dealt with enough bullshit . 
  if anyone in this world understands how terrible war is , and how bad it is to be subjected to the will of russia , it 's the poles . 
  out of principle we should ensure the horrors of wwii and post-war soviet-style domination do n't happen again , because we have the ability to prevent it . 
  not doing so would be a sign , to me , that the us lost its way . 
  we have a shitload of wealth and military capabilities , spending a few tens of billions to shore up the defense and deterrence of our allies is an incredible small price to pay for what it accomplishes . 
  it 's a pittance , almost trivial , considering how much excess wealth our country has . 
  the us has $ 270 trillion in assets and trump wants to make what we spend on our nato allies a pet issue . 
  it 's stupid . 
  that 's not to say that our europeans do n't need to work on reducing their dependence on the us , but the countries messing up in that regard are the uk , germany , and france , not poland . 
  that 's hyperbole but that 's actually somewhat accurate . 
  nato without the us is pretty pathetic . 
  most nato countries ' militaries are oriented towards a sort of hierarchy of leadership with the us being at the top . 
  they ca n't do much other than administration and small-scale operations if the us is n't involved . 
  remember kosovo ? 
  despite the fact that pretty much all of western europe was on board , the [ us did basically all of the work ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20140826172028/http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4296.pdf ) . 
  the us provided almost all the intelligence , command and control , and heavy firepower/air strikes . 
  european nations were incapable of contributing equally with the us and operating without the us overseeing and directing everything . 
  some people may think that things have changed since then , but the recent [ western intervention in libya showed again that europe depends on the us militarily ] ( https://euobserver.com/defence/115650 ) . 
  do n't let your biases or your pride cloud your judgment . 
  the state of military effectiveness among eu nations is incredibly , dangerously bad . 
  only france and the uk have anything approaching the ability to lead and execute large-scale , high-temp military operations , and both still ca n't do much without the us being in the picture . 
  all of the military forces of the entire eu combined only have [ 10 % ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20140826172028/http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4296.pdf ) of the capability that the us military possesses . 
  only [ 2.7 % ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/10/eu.military ) of european troops are trained and equipped to a sufficient degree to be deployed in combat . 
  a lot of the military spending in the eu is wasted . 
  lots of weird and conflicting priorities , which are exacerbated by the lack of integration . 
  you ca n't compare spending between the eu and russia and think that effectiveness is directly proportionate . 
  russia has a lot of capabilities that eu countries lack . 
  nato without the us , being mostly eu countries , is pretty pathetic . 
  a lot of people do n't like to hear that but it 's true . 
  it 's a pretty dangerous situation . 
  threats have moved on but europeans have become complacent due to the us providing security and deterrence so they 've allowed themselves to become weak and even more dependent . 
  in the 90 's the western world intervened to stop a supposed genocide in the balkans . 
  there was basically a complete consensus that we needed to stop the serbs . 
  despite the fact that pretty much all of western europe was on board , the [ us did basically all of the work ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20140826172028/http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4296.pdf ) .

  europe has actually been becoming increasingly more pathetic and feckless . 
   right , qualities like money , and purchasing power . 
  take for example the company i work for , one of the top 3 companies in the world in its area . 
  most of the software r&d is done in latvia . 
  hardware is designed in ukraine , and made in china , only assembled in the states to be able to put a `` made in usa '' sticker on it . 
  the owner of the company lives in riga . 
  this sounds like an anecdote you made up . 
   yet the money is american , so it is an american company . 
  europe is wealthier than the us in absolute terms and yet ... [ 8 of the top 14 it companies in the world are american ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_information_technology_companies ) . 
  the rest are asian . 
  none are european . 
  [ 8 of the top 10 software companies are american ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_software_companies ) . 
  2 are european . 
  coming back to this :  right , qualities like money , and purchasing power . 
  one major reason for the us leading is that the us has the best universities in related fields . 
  [ natural sciences and mathematics ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/fieldsci2015.html ) ( 14 of the top 20 universities are american ) [ engineering/technology and computer sciences ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/fieldeng2015.html ) ( 14 of the top 20 ) it 's funny when people need to resort to mental gymnastics to avoid giving the us credit for anything , even for things that are blatantly obvious . 
   you talk about intel and amd , yet the most widely used processor architecture in the world is designed in uk . 
  [ the world leader in semiconductor market share is intel . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semiconductor_sales_leaders_by_year#ranking_for_year_2014 ) try again . 
  that man was a straight-up , ballin ' wordsmith when it came to economics debates .
