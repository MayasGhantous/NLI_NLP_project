  if a homeless person came up to me and asked me for money , i 'd probably give them whatever i could spare . 
  if someone in tactical gear armed with an assault rifle ran up to me and said `` give that homeless man money !, 
  or else ! '', 
  i 'd be pretty pissed off about it . 
   americans just hate taxes more than anybody else as they see the government as inefficent . 
  well , the government absolutely is inefficient . 
  beyond that it 's also a matter of principle . 
  very few americans dislike the idea of taxes that contribute to common things that benefit most everyone like roads , schools , defense etc. . . but programs designed specifically to take money from some people and give it to other people , who did n't earn it , crosses a threshold where taxation becomes immoral and unfair , even if it 's supposedly doing something good . 
  forcing someone to help someone else , or being forced by someone else to help someone else , is not moral , even in the eyes of people who will willingly dedicate time and money to help people as individuals . 
  no , you do n't `` give '' . 
  taxes are compulsory . 
  someone taking money from you without your ability to opt out , and using that money in your name , does not make you compassionate . 
  i 'm not aware of any country that has referendums on tax plans . 
  i 'm not aware of any country that has a tax code where individuals can opt out of development aid . 
  what a country 's government gives to other governments is an incredibly arbitrary , narrow , and meaningless statistic to use to determine what countries are the most compassionate . 
  people love to bring up developmental aid , which is only what governments give to other governments , when that type of aid not only does n't reflect the individuals in the country that gives aid , but it omits all the charitable work that is done by individuals and private charities that are funded by voluntary donations . 
  people love to bring up that narrow developmental aid to say the us is n't a giving nation , because the us government only gives something like $ 30 billion in aid , but it discounts the fact that over 10 times that amount of money is donated by americans , freely , of their own accord , to private , domestic and international charities . 
  [ correct . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_giving_index#world_giving_index_rankings ) when countries are ranked by how much their population gives , freely , of their own time and money to charitable causes , the uk is the most charitable nation in europe . 
  in my opinion this is a better metric for determining how compassionate a country is than by comparing countries by how much their governments give in official aid to other governments , which is usually the metric people use for some odd , dishonest reason . 
  i find it funny that germans and french people find british people to be the least compassionate when [ the uk is the most charitable nation in europe .

   no , we 're not in any way dependent whatsoever . 
  rather , many europeans who have a dismissive attitude about the us are incapable of admitting anything positive about the us that might make europe look worse or dependent . 
  lots of europeans believe that they do n't depend on the us , not because they do n't depend on the us , but because giving the us credit is antithetical to their world view and general smug sense of superiority over americans . 
  you could be objectively , undeniably , patently dependent on the us but still refuse to admit it because doing so would n't appeal to your biases . 
  all of the military forces of the entire eu combined only have [ 10 % ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20140826172028/http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4296.pdf ) of the capability that the us military possesses . 
  only [ 2.7 % ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/10/eu.military ) of european troops are trained and equipped to a sufficient degree to be deployed in combat . 
  the germans have [ literally had to use broomsticks ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/02/19/germanys-army-is-so-under-equipped-that-it-used-broomsticks-instead-of-machine-guns/ ) in place of machine guns and [ only 8 of their 109 eurofighters are operational . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11057330/german-fighter-jets-unable-to-fly-and-mechanics-forced-to-borrow-spare-parts-claims-magazine.html ) this would be hilarious if it were n't dangerous . 
  [ europe depends on the us for defense and to protect their interests ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/10013197/america-our-great-protector-is-looking-the-other-way.html ) some examples . 
  in the 90 's the western world intervened to stop a supposed genocide in the balkans . 
  there was basically a complete consensus that we needed to stop the serbs . 
  despite the fact that pretty much all of western europe was on board , the [ us did basically all of the work ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20140826172028/http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4296.pdf ) . 
  the us provided almost all the intelligence , command and control , and heavy firepower/air strikes . 
  some people may think that things have changed since then , but the recent [ western intervention in libya showed again that europe depends on the us militarily ] ( https://euobserver.com/defence/115650 ) . 
  as much as this angers people when it 's said , it is a fact that the us is paying for the defense of countries that owe their security to the us , and the us gets very little gratitude for it . 
  a lot of europeans would rather jump off a building and snag their nut sack on the way down than admit that they owe the us anything . 
   who 's the threat ? 
  are you serious ? 
  they could n't even afford to go to war with us . 
  the very atmosphere and blanket of security that allows you to pretend that you face no threats and do n't need the us , * is provided by the us . 
  the alliance between feminism and islam is just a little crazy . 
  talk about cognitive dissonance . 
   you linked the shanghai ranking , which is criticized by basically everyone for specifically selecting criteria to ensure as few european universities as possible are in the ranking . 
  no , it 's criticized by people who want to disregard its findings because it demonstrates the clear superiority that the us has over europe in higher education . 
   second , you 're denying that the us software industry happens to be started from the technology cluster around silicon valley , which was heavily dod-funded ? 
  you 're saying the us does n't lead in software development because ... of how the industry in the us was originally funded . 
  `` does n't count !, 
  it was funded by the military ! '', 
  that 's not an argument you 're making , that 's just mental gymnastics . 
  `` it does n't matter that you 're stronger than me , because i do n't go to the gym . 
  i win ! '', 
   third , the prada not just happened to have a touchscreen , it had a multitouch screen , introducing ui gestures and apps . 
  so the surface mechanics of a touch screen being originally offered in a phone 10 years ago means that all advances in mobile processors and mobile software since then do n't count . 
  the iphone today that has undergone a decade of refinement and advances does n't count . 
  you are absolutely desperate to preserve your hilariously undeserved sense of superiority over the us , even in areas where the us absolutely dominates europe . 
  your world view resembles a mental disorder . 
   but look at the entire embedded market , look at the computer engineering market , look at business-to-business stuff , and it 's a lot less one-sided . 
  prove it . 
  and lol at you pretending that the us does n't dominate in business-to-business software . 
  not only are you unaware of how many sales microsoft has from businesses that depend on their services , but you 've never heard of : [ symantec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symantec ) [ vmware ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vmware ) [ oracle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oracle_corporation ) [ fixerv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiserv ) [ intuit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intuit ) [ ca technologies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ca_technologies ) all of these 6 companies primarily specialize in business-to-business software sales . 
  and they are among the top 15 software companies in the world . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_software_companies there are only two companies from europe on the list . 
   all your sources were focused on that , and you have n't shown a single source about the us dominating the rest of it . 
  i absolutely have , while you 've provided no sources * at all . 
  alex jones believes that the global elite are in cahoots with interdimensional beings that give them otherwordly power to control humanity and take away free will . 
  he believes that ai will be designed , literally with the help of `` the fallen one '' , so that it can monitor all human thoughts and actions , and that ai was foretold as the antichrist in the bible . 
  he said that shit , completely seriously , on the joe rogan podcast recently . 
  granted , he had just smoked weed , but still . 
  dude is loony tunes on pluto levels of crazy . 
   because the definition of a superpower is n't the country with the largest economy , even if you 're talking only in economic terms . 
  if a country has economic output that is over twice as large as that of the next largest economy , it is absolutely an economic superpower . 
   by the way , what is the point of your account ? 
  your user name is `` mightierthanthou '' and it seems the only thing you ever post on reddit is how awesome and powerful america is compared to other countries . 
  what 's going on with that ? 
  are you familiar with reddit ? 
  people say a lot of negative and false nonsense about the us all the time . 
  it 's impossible to navigate this site without seeing it . 
  i have information that proves that nonsense wrong . 
  therefore that 's what i do . 
  if you encountered someone who posted almost exclusively about how shitty the us is and how good some other country is , you would n't find it to be odd at all . 
  that is very common . 
  how is that not a superpower situation ? 
  the us had by far the largest economy in the world . 
  the us was a superpower during the cold war when the ussr had a huge economy . 
  think about it . 
   it is better at developing stuff ? 
  where ? 
  you seem to be in denial . 
  you 're actually convincing yourself that the only reason american companies lead in it and software is because they have good marketing . 
  that 's absolutely hilarious . 
   the iphone , which is a clone of the lg prada ? 
  what year do you think it is right now ? 
  by the way , what is your proof for this claim ? 
  that the lg prada had a touch screen , therefore the iphone is a clone ? 
   microsoft 's software , which only got profitable because they luckily could get an exclusive deal to distribute ms-dos ? 
  name a european company that is comparable to microsoft . 
  you ca n't , because there is none . 
  that 's not because microsoft has a good marketing division , it 's because microsoft develops a large number of powerful and useful software products .
