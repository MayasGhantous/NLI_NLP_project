  ** it 's ok for you to claim that without the french there 'd be no us , but at the same time europeans freak out and act like americans are arrogant for mentioning the central role the us had in the liberation of france , lend-lease , and the marshall plan . 
  you do n't understand why a massive protest in europe should be more important for a british news agency than the moment-to-moment minutia of us domestic politics ? 
  the bbc will highlight , report , analyze and exaggerate the importance of any development in us politics whatsoever as long as it can be perceived as negative and can lend credibility to the narrative that the us is a shambles . 
  the bbc not only focuses on us news more than news in countries that are much nearer to the uk , they in many cases focus people 's attention on the us to draw attention away from inconvenient stories in the uk itself . 
  they scrutinize the us and everything about it more than they do their own country . 
  i have n't seen this reported in the news very much . 
  the bbc right now is obsessing over the us , as usual , and has n't mentioned this protest at all from what i 've seen . 
  edit : [ this is the front page of the world section on bbc right now . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f1f82oe.jpg ) lots of domestic us politics , a bit of us celebrity news near the top , a few entertaining non-stories , a handful of actual news stories , but not a single mention of massive protests in romania . 
  if there was a protest half the size in the us right now against trump , it would have 3 reports and analyses at least . 
  there 's even a major article right now about americans being ashamed of the us . 
  how that could possibly be considered world news and significant enough to warrant attention is incredible . 
  a story about beyonce having babies is near the top . 
  let that sink in . 
  that qualifies as world news to the bbc . 
  gold standard of international journalism they say . 
  what a joke . 
  this has nothing to do with what us i 'm living in and everything to do with the facts . 
  you 're talking about financial difficulties people in the us have that act as a barrier to higher education , and yet different but bigger barriers prevent access to higher education in european countries , as evidenced by the fact that americans are more likely to receive a bachelor 's degree or higher than europeans are . 
  let 's use germany , again , as an example . 
  in germany the vast majority of students end their schooling for life at the age of 16 . 
  lots of students that had aspirations for university are basically told they 're too eccentric and/or too stupid to be worthy of government funded education . 
  it 's silly to boast about `` free university '' when very few students are selected to receive it , and many students who had the ability to succeed in university are told to be plumbers or something . 
  what good is free education for a select few , when it results in less people being educated overall ? 
  the german education system basically uses secondary schooling as a time to iron out eccentricities . 
  in the us , lots of kids who did n't have their act together in high school have gone on to excel in university and contribute to the us in meaningful ways . 
  lots of innovators in industry and technology in the us would have , had they been born in germany , become laborers . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  [ the us has the 2nd-highest rate of university-level educational attainment in the world , second only to norway . 
  ] ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/090908/t090908b1-eng.htm ) the vast majority of the us is more highly educated than the vast majority of the eu . 
  people always praise germany for its free education and yet the attainment of university education in the us is about double what it is in germany . 
   `` made in mexico '' just to suppourt them against this shit they have to go through now lol , what do they have to go through now ? 
  not being able to illegally enter the us and leech off of our country ? 
  having tariffs put on their exports to the us when they themselves have had waaay more numerous and higher tariffs on us imports for years and years ? 
  your anti-american bias is clouding your judgment . 
  you 're supporting mexico because you see animosity between the us and mexico and you 're doing a sort of `` enemy of my enemy is my friend '' type thing . 
  pathetic . 
   the same applies for the kiel institute of economy ( it was split from the university , too ) . 
   or the max-planck institute in greifswald , which builds the wendelstein 7-x fusion reactor . 
  its researchers teach at the university , but it 's not counted . 
   this model is very common across europe , but unheard of in the us . 
  it 's not unheard of in the us . 
  what you just described sounds like the arrangement between universities and private and public research organizations like the [ lawrence livermore national laboratory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lawrence_livermore_national_laboratory ) in the us . 
  the very argument you 're making to try and explain away us research dominance by making excuses for europe , could also be applied to a lot of research done in the us . 
  there are many public and private research facilities in the us . 
  ah , so no evidence . 
  just anecdotes designed to allow europeans to avoid acknowledging american research is better . 
  by the way , do n't even consider the fact that a lot of research is done non-university institutes in the us . 
  that would just complicate your argument . 
   the eu dominates the us in research rankings . 
  prove it . 
  you ca n't , because the arwu ranking i linked to is in fact mostly based on research output and quality . 
  if europe beats the us in research , how do you explain why the us is ranked as the most scientifically impactful nation in the world in the h-index , with a gigantic margin in the score between the us and any current eu country ? 
  us h-index score : [ 1305 ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20150703203736/http://www.realclearscience.com/lists/top_10_countries_with_greatest_scientific_impact/1_united_states.html?state=stop ) germany h-index score : [ 704 ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20130608064525/http://www.realclearscience.com/lists/top_10_countries_with_greatest_scientific_impact/3_germany.html?state=stop ) and before you say it 's due to population size , no . 
  the h-index is measured relative to population . 
  the us does the most in science research in both absolute and relative terms . 
   the eu dominates the us in research rankings . 
  is this what you 're taught or did you just make that up on the spot because you want it to be true ?
