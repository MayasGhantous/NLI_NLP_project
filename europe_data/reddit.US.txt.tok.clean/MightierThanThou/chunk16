  europe [ depends on the us ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/10013197/america-our-great-protector-is-looking-the-other-way.html ) for defense and to protect european interests .

  the us is about as wealthy and the next 5 wealthiest nations in the world * combined * . 
  over ** 1/3rd ** of all wealth in the world is owned by just the us even though the us is only 1/20th of the global population .

  fight me . 
   it is not a propaganda reel . 
  as someone who has done marketing photography , many of those photos appear to me to be set up and framed in a way to sell something , in this case sell the soviet way of life . 
  they 're not just random photos taken by an amateur photographer . 
  in fact , it should be pointed out that photography of that quality would be basically beyond the means of average soviet citizens during the 60 's . 
  this leads me to believe that many of those photos were set up and the people in the photos are models . 
  also take note of how many people in the photos are not looking at the camera . 
  if they were just some random person being photographed they would be looking at the camera curiously . 
  trained models learn to appear like they 're focused on something else and are n't aware of being photographed . 
  do n't pretend your propaganda photo reel defines the soviet union or that the soviet union did n't have and that russia does n't have a lot of lingering self-inflicted problems that have nothing to do with capitalism . 
  the standard of living in the soviet union never matched that of the average western , capitalist nation . 
  it was way worse . 
  was that the fault of capitalism ? 
  give me a break . 
  are you having an episode or something , or are you using an alt and do n't realize it ? 
  with the account you 're currently using , you only have a handful of comments and the very first one is a reply to me . 
  you replied to me , i did n't initially reply to you . 
  * initiated contact * got a response * demands a cessation of communication * continues to make contact and makes ironic and psychotic accusations against the other party yep , bona fide wacko . 
  never put your dick in crazy . 
  you initiated contact you crazy spinster . 
  good . 
  but do n't expect any alimony . 
   yeah , because it was a stupid expedition right from the get-go . 
  if course it was just doing what was necessary , then say you did something and then get the fuck out as fast as possible . 
  no matter how stupid europeans get , the us still supports their military endeavors , consider the recent [ western intervention in libya showed again that europe depends on the us militarily ] ( https://euobserver.com/defence/115650 ) . 
  the us did almost all the work despite it being advertised as a european operation . 
   the us can already decrease it 's excessive spending it 's not excessive spending when you consider how many countries depend on the us for defense . 
  also it 's really ironic for someone who belongs to a country that depends on the us for defense talking about the us having a bloated military budget . 
  that 's rich . 
  if the us spent less on defense , europeans like you would either have to spend more yourselves or risk becoming completely feckless in global affairs and incapable of protecting your interests . 
   but they wo n't because of the military -- industrial complex and the fact that the us army is partly a work program for the otherwise unemployed . 
  statements like that are exactly the kind of shitty , smug european attitude that results in americans like trump questioning nato . 
  not only are you ungrateful , you go in the opposite direction and have a derisive view of the us military despite how much you depend on it . 
  also what you just said has no grounding in reality , at all . 
  you ca n't even base your smug attitude on facts . 
  where to begin ? 
   but they wo n't because of the military -- industrial complex the us defense budget in 2016 was [ $ 585 billion . 
  ] ( http://www.defense.gov/news/special-reports/fy16-budget ) the us gdp for 2016 will be around [ $ 18 trillion . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp ) that 's ** 3.25 % ** of gdp . 
  much of that defense budget actually goes to the arms industries in other countries , because not all military spending is spent domestically . 
  you could say `` what about exports ? '', 
  well then let 's talk about exports . 
  weapons exports are only a tiny percentage of the us economy . 
  us arms exports : [ $ 10,000,000,000 \\ ( $ 10.2 billion \\ ) ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-v-us-arms-imports-2015-4 ) us total exports : [ $ 2,230,000,000,0000 ( $ 2.23 trillion ) ] ( http://useconomy.about.com/od/tradepolicy/p/imports-exports-components.htm ) about ** 0.46 % ** of us exports , in dollar value , consist of arms . 
  for a nice contrast , the us exports about [ $ 83 ] ( http://www.worldstopexports.com/united-states-top-10-exports/ ) billion worth of medical equipment every year . 
  ** the us is about 8 times more dependent on the sale of medical equipment than it is on the sale of weapons . 
  ** consumer and business information technology , along with medical equipment , are waaaay more important to the us economy . 
  [ 8 of the top 14 it companies in the world are american . ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_information_technology_companies ) . 
  [ 7 of the top 10 software companies are american . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_software_companies ) the largest tech company in the us is apple . 
  its yearly revenue is ** $ 233.7 billion . 
  ** the largest defense contractor in the us is lockheed martin , whose yearly revenue is only ** $ 36 billion . 
  ** the hysteria about the evil `` military-industrial complex '' is just propaganda . 
   and the fact that the us army is partly a work program for the otherwise unemployed . 
  [ people in the us military are on average more educated than people in the general us population . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/11/military-education-infographic_n_1873842.html ) us work force is 160 million . 
  the us active duty military is only 1.3 million . 
  less than 1 % of the us workforce is employed by us military . 
  the medical , it , auto industry etc. . . each employ more people than the us military does . 
  [ many industries employe more people than the us military does , including state and local governments . 
   the 2 pct is a target , not a legal obligation and nobody asks the us to spend so insane amounts on their military . 
  by underfunding their militaries , us allies required the us to spend a lot on its military . 
   however , as soon as the alliance might get tested , you look for an excuse to get out . 
  that 's dishonourable . 
  lol . 
  more dishonorable than giving zero gratitude to a country you depend on for defense ? 
   when you called on allies after 9/11 we came . 
  and the only country in nato that provided more than a token contribution to the war on terror was the uk . 
  everyone else did the bare minimum . 
   more danish soldiers have died there per capita than us soldiers . 
  let that sink in . 
  per capita as in relative to their troop numbers or relative to denmark 's population ? 
  still a silly and narrow argument to make when only 43 danes have died in afghanistan compared to 2,270 americans . 
   the gap is there because you 're spending habits are absurd . 
  that 's easy for someone to say when they live in a country that heavily depends on another country for defense . 
  there are literally dozens of countries that depend directly and indirectly on the us military .
