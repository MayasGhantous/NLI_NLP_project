  you 're using the internet , which was invented by the us military , was up until very recently controlled by the us government , and probably the majority of the sites you use have servers based in the us . 
  the us is the [ origin of ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_protocol_suite ) and the [ center of ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_internet_hosts ) the internet . 
  the us is 5 % of the earth 's population but has literally the majority of internet hosts . 
  you may want to sanction the us , or think you do , but you probably would n't actually want to live life without using american technology . 
  you 'd last a few days living like a retrobate and then realize the error of your ways when your society literally could n't function . 
  talk tough though , that 's what you can do . 
  have fun with that . 
  yes , you 're blaming everyone in the us and everything about the us except the actual people who commit huge amounts of homicide . 
  you want to criticize the us as a whole for its high homicide rates and blame racism when it 's pointed out that it 's demographics , not gun laws or american culture , that is mostly the issue . 
  the map is deliberately deceptive so you wo n't grasp this by looking at op 's picture , but most areas of the us that have similar demographics to any european country will have similar levels of homicide , regardless of gun laws or `` social conditions '' . 
  if nothing about the system , culture , or gun laws in the us changed but its demographics shifted to more closely resemble western european countries , the us would not have a peculiarly high homicide rate . 
   it 's important not to blame black people , but to blame the social and economic situations which cause black people to commit more crime on average in that country . 
  that 's funny , because the richest blacks still commit higher rates of homicide than the poorest whites in the us . 
  could be some sort of occult symbol she 's making with her hands . 
  he could have played pennywise in the movie ` it ' . 
  your processor might have been manufactured in korea but it was almost certainly designed by intel or amd , both american companies that nearly completely dominate the pc semiconductor market . 
   being on a website ( uk/switzerland , sir berners lee ) it 's incredible to see people rewriting history to rob the us of credit . 
  it makes them look incredibly pathetic . 
  they 're so desperate to obfuscate facts and lie to themselves so they can preserve an unrealistically negative view of the us . 
  you obviously do n't understand the difference between the internet and the web or their relation to each other . 
  allow me to educate you . 
  the internet is the [ internet protocol suite ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_protocol_suite ) , aka the tcp/ip protocol , invented by [ robert kahn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bob_kahn ) and [ vinton cerf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vinton_g._cerf ) , two americans working for the us military . 
  it 's the technology that actually transmits data . 
  it is the internet . 
  originally it was a us military network called [ arpanet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arpanet ) , when it was expanded to civilian and global use , it became the internet . 
  the web came later . 
  the web is a system of code that is transmitted via the internet , that only serves to compile data and then display it in a visual interface in a browser . 
  tim berners-lee took existing hypertext code ( [ invented by an american ] ( http://www.livinginternet.com/w/wi_nelson.htm ) ) and just created the first monolithic system of hypertext that became standard . 
  the internet is the more crucial technology . 
  the internet can function without the web , the web can not function without the internet . 
  giving credit to the europeans for the internet would be like taking credit for designing a car when all you did was paint the exterior . 
   using a computer ( germany , konrad zuse / uk , alan turing ) the first digital , programmable computer that forms the basis of modern computing was the [ eniac ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eniac ) , which was invented in the us . 
  basically all personal computers today use american-designed computing architecture and american components . 
  intel and amd are both american , and they nearly completely dominate the microchip market . 
  the [ microprocessor ] ( http://inventors.about.com/od/mstartinventions/a/microprocessor.htm ) , the [ hard drive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_hard_disk_drives#1950s.e2.80.931970s ) , the [ graphics card ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geforce_256 ) , and [ ram ] ( http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa100898.htm ) are all forms of computer components that pcs use that were invented in the us . 
   congratulations on being so poor . 
  the us national wealth is [ $ 86 trillion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_wealth ) . 
  the next wealthiest nation ( china ) only has $ 22.8 trillion in national wealth . 
  the us is about as wealthy and the next 5 wealthiest nations in the world * combined * . 
  over ** 1/3rd ** of all wealth in the world is owned by just the us even though the us is only 1/20th of the global population . 
  a nice graph to illustrate just how insanely , disproportionately wealthy the us is : https://i.redd.it/kc1vbf5liyzw.png [ on an individual level as well , americans are the wealthiest people on the planet . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_financial_assets_per_capita ) anti-americanism is so hilarious . 
  you have to lie to yourself and others and say bunch of hilariously false nonsense as part of your coping mechanism . 
  what are you coping with ? 
  being inferior to the country you love to hate . 
  if you believe the us makes the world a worse place , you certainly do n't act on that belief , considering the fact that almost every technology you just used , that the whole world benefits from , to post your stupid comment on this american internet site was given to the world by the us . 
  [ american universities lead the world in every field . 
  ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/arwu2014.html ) look at the rankings of world universities in [ natural sciences and mathematics ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/fieldsci2016.html ) . 
  15 of the top 20 universities are american . 
  only 4 are european , for example . 
  american universities similarly dominate in specific fields like [ physics ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectphysics2015.html ) , [ chemistry ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectchemistry2015.html ) and [ computer science ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectcs2015.html ) . 
  the us does [ 78 % ] ( http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/sb118610945461187080 ) of global medical research spending , despite being only 5 % of the earth 's population and 20 % of its economic output . 
  [ eight of the top 10 medical advances in the past 20 years were developed or had roots in the u.s. 
  the nobel prizes in medicine and physiology have been awarded to more americans than to researchers in all other countries combined . 
  eight of the 10 top-selling drugs in the world were developed by u.s. 
  companies . 
  ] ( http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052748704130904574644230678102274 ) pretty sure the global medical and biotechnology community would mourn the loss of the us , considering literally the majority of medical advances take place in the us and are then shared with the world . 
  [ the us has the most nobel prizes in the world . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nobel_laureates_by_country ) we live in the information age , which is founded almost entirely on an american inventions . 
  to this day , the us dominates in information technology . 
  [ 8 of the top 14 it companies in the world are american ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_information_technology_companies ) . 
  [ 8 of the top 10 software companies are american ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_software_companies ) the us is responsible for the peace and stability of the world . 
  europe , despite being rich , advanced , and more populous than the us , only possesses [ 10 % ] ( http://www.library.eiu.edu/ersvdocs/4296.pdf ) of the military capabilities the us has . 
  europe [ depends on the us ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/10013197/america-our-great-protector-is-looking-the-other-way.html ) for defense and to protect european interests . 
  the us is also [ responsible for the defense of japan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defence_policy_of_japan ) , which is the 3rd largest economy in the world and a huge technological powerhouse . 
  so no . 
  the world would be a much worse place without the us . 
   i hope their fate will be similar too . 
  you say that while on a us-based internet site , using a browser that is almost certainly american ( chrome , firefox , safari , ie , edge , all american ) , using a computer that runs almost certainly either windows or mac os , both american oss , or a smartphone that runs ios or android , both american . 
  you 're on a computer whose components were invented in and probably designed by the us , all on the internet that was invented by the us military , the country that to this day has literally the [ majority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_internet_hosts ) of the world 's internet servers , despite being only 5 % of the world 's population . 
   you have n't been first amongst many things for a long time . 
  europe is behind the us in [ technological advancement ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/fieldeng2014.html ) and [ scientific impact ] ( http://www.realclearscience.com/lists/top_10_countries_with_greatest_scientific_impact/1_united_states.html?state=stop ) look at the rankings of world universities in [ natural sciences and mathematics ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/fieldsci2016.html ) . 
  15 of the top 20 universities are american . 
  only 4 are european . 
  american universities similarly dominate in specific fields like [ physics ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectphysics2015.html ) , [ chemistry ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectchemistry2015.html ) and [ computer science ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectcs2015.html ) . 
  we live in the information age that the us gave birth to , and american companies still dominate . 
  [ 8 of the top 14 it companies in the world are american ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_information_technology_companies ) . 
  the rest are asian . 
  none are european . 
  [ 7 of the top 10 software companies are american ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_software_companies ) . 
  2 are european . 
   only inside your own bubble . 
  it sounds like you reside in an intellectual vacuum where the us is never given credit for anything and is only criticized and depicted in unrealistically negative ways . 
   it is true , that your universities are good and highly ranked . 
  but the ranking is not about the general quality of education/education experience of students it absolutely is . 
   the shanghai ranking takes the number of publications . 
  keep in mind , that many scientists go to the us and publish there . 
  only [ 4 % ] ( https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2014/11/17/number-of-international-college-students-continues-to-climb ) of people at american universities are foreigners . 
  that is much lower than the percentage of the general us population that is foreign . 
  you 're doing what people always do , you ca n't give the us credit even for its glaringly obvious leadership in some areas , so you have to resort to mental gymnastics and accredit us success with benevolent foreigners coming here . 
  if foreigners were responsible for the performance of american universities , then logically foreign universities would be doing better , because they 'd have more smart europeans and asians and fewer stupid americans to dilute the talent , right ? 
  anti-americanism is retarded . 
   and that the us universities get way more funding thus are able to publish even more . 
  people public because they have a lot of good research . 
  gauging research output and quality is a great way to measure how good a university is at educating and creating competent professionals . 
  if you know anything about what a university is , and what a degree signifies , you 'll know that being a student at a university is n't just about passively absorbing information , it 's about demonstrating your competence in your field by contributing to it . 
  how do you contribute to your field ? 
  research . 
  it 's not just about throwing money at things , but that is an important part and not a knock on the quality of a university . 
  universities attract investment when they have excellent staff and students who are likely to put research grants into good use and contribute to their fields .
