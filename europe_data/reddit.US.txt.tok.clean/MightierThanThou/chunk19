   germany places quite far above the us in e.g. 
  the pisa tests . 
  the pisa tests only gauge the performance of 15 year old students . 
  and the national averages the us has are lowered not because of the quality of education but because the us has a far higher rate of minorities and a huge growing population of latinos specifically , due to huge levels of immigration . 
  there are millions of students in us schools who barely speak english either because they were born in a spanish-speaking country or raised in an exclusively spanish-speaking household . 
  the us has a statistical disadvantage from the onset . 
  there are other factors outside of education policies and quality that affect how well students will perform in school . 
  having a stable household and parents that can participate in their education is huge , and a tremendous amount of students in the us are sabotaged by their culture . 
  about half of students in public education right now are black or latino . 
  [ whites and asians in the us though do incredibly well , even when receiving the same level of education as blacks and latinos who tend to do poorly in school regardless of how well a school is funded . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/l5onkgo.png ) germany is about [ 90 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany#migrationshintergrund.2f_migrant_background ) white european . 
  the us is only [ 62 % ] ( http://time.com/3934092/us-population-diversity-census/ ) white . 
  you can pat yourselves on the back as if your marginally higher pisa scores are due to being better than the us and the us sux , but if nothing about our systems changed but us demographics shifted to more closely resemble yours , we 'd have higher pisa scores than you have . 
  our demographical shift in our country is causing our relative academic performance to go down , even though education quality is good and whites and asians in the us do better than just about everyone else . 
  everything you said is hyperbolic hysteria . 
  example :  i also mean the us system where politicans have politicized curriculums so that the biblical story of creation ( dont give me that intelligent design crap ) is being taught next to scientific theory this is not a thing in public education . 
  only a very small number of public schools in the us have science textbooks with a religious disclaimer mentioning the conflict between science and religious views on creation and history . 
  creationism is not taught as a science in public schools . 
  there is no textbook using bible verses as their curriculum , unless its a theology texbook . 
  judging by this tremendous anti-american circle-jerk in these comments , europeans want this guy to represent americans . 
  they want to hate on americans based on the act of an individual , who was drunk no less . 
  notice the complete freak out in which people are using this topic to segue into larger , hateful condemnations of all americans ? 
  if this guy was any other nationality , the reaction would be much different . 
  you mean the us education system in which [ twice as many americans receive university level education compared to germans ] ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/090908/t090908b1-eng.htm ) and american universities are [ ranked the best in the world ? 
  the fact that the guy is american causes europeans to immediately apply their bias to this topic and use this topic to satiate their larger , preexisting anti-americanism . 
  these comments are absolutely , despicably ignorant and opportunistic . 
  the chinese tourists doing nazi salutes was one thing , this is another thing entirely , because american . 
  since the guy is american , people are using this topic to segue into vicious hatred of americans , which they would not do with any other nationality . 
   if a german tourist came to the us and burned a us flag in the street , and got beaten half to death , no american would be condemning that action . 
  your anti-americanism has bedeviled your sense of reality . 
  imported into europe and be given immunity from criticism because people who criticize them are charged with hate speech ? 
  so ... business as usual ? 
   some americans on the internet should really stop declaring their views on reality when they know so little . 
  people like you should stop relying on people 's bias against the us to invalidate views that challenge your own . 
  bringing up my nationality is pretty much the easiest , most pathetic way of obfuscating this issue . 
  you 're using anti-americanism to warp topics that you would prefer were n't discussed . 
  you can disregard any criticism i make toward your country as being american ignorance . 
  i remember a time , not too far in the past , when people were talking about the prospect of turkey joining the european union with complete seriousness . 
  people were celebrating the idea that a muslim-majority country became a liberal democracy with a value system similar to european nations . 
  what a joke . 
  completely incompatible cultures in reality . 
  you guys dodged that bullet i guess . 
  but wait , turkey is in nato . 
  hmmm . 
   yet in the us people die by the hundreds of thousands , because they ca n't afford a doctor . 
  you are absolutely brainwashed out of your mind . 
   i ca n't imagine any scenario where georgia us is better than belgium or about half of other european countries that says very little about actual respective quality of life but says a lot about how you 're confused when propaganda you hear is contradicted by the facts . 
  your understanding of quality of life in the us is inaccurate . 
  you 've been led to believe that quality of life is higher in europe and it confuses you when this unassailable perception you 're accustomed to being treated as fact is proved to be false . 
   surely there must be a way to provide healthcare to those that ca n't afford it themselves . 
  [ medicare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medicare_\\ ( united_states \\ ) ) [ medicaid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medicaid ) [ chip ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_children%27s_health_insurance_program  also , how does the government choose who gets to go to university in germany and france ? 
  i 've never heard of that and it sounds wrong . 
  the public , government-controlled education system in germany forces students out of the education system . 
  in fact , a lot of german students leave school at age 16 . 
  it 's not some utopia where everyone who wants to go to university can do so for free . 
  the government in partner with the education system makes that determination . 
  a lot of students in germany rejected from university education would have , had they lived in the us , been able to go to a university . 
   america won the competition after a few world wars and became the global superpower and because of it y' all are rich not really . 
  europeans also like to jealously rationalize american power by pretending it 's a result of luck or circumstance and is n't an actual accomplishment of americans . 
  it 's a neurosis some people have in which they are n't capable of giving the us credit for anything . 
  the us was well on its way to becoming an economic superpower before wwii . 
  [ the us had the largest economy in the world in the world as far back as 1913 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) #world _ 1 . e2 .80.932003 _ .28 maddison .29 ) long before that , as far back as the middle of the 1800 's , the us economy was as big or bigger than most european economies . 
  in [ 1938 ] ( http://www.mnstarfire.com/ww2/history/economic/gdp1938.html ) , before the us entered wwii , the us economy was over twice as large as the next largest economy . 
  us gdp : $ 800 billion ussr gdp : $ 359 billion . 
  the us is a rich country with high quality of life because of its own merits , not because of some crazy coincidence or cosmic moment of luck . 
   but obviously his point was n't that you guys do n't have healthcare/education , it 's more about the fact that you ca n't get equal access to those if you 're poor . 
  if health care and education are better on average for more people , does it matter of if it 's not equal ? 
  weird mentality , that notion of fairness is more important than actual results . 
  people rant and rave about countries like germany and france having free university education and yet they omit the part that the government dictates who gets it , and both germans and french people overall have about ** half ** the educational attainment that americans have . 
  * americans are twice as likely to graduate from a university . 
  * what solace is it for someone who wants to attend university in germany who is denied the opportunity , that if he/she could attend university , it would be `` free '' ( see : funded by taxes ) ? 
  should we adopt a system in which a larger number of people miss out on that opportunity just to create the false perception that our system is more fair ? 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
   again , no healthcare aside from having [ the most responsive health care system in the world ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052748704130904574644230678102274?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fonline.wsj.com%2farticle%2fsb10001424052748704130904574644230678102274.html ) with the highest survival rates from treatable diseases like cancer .

  you actually think the us has `` no healthcare '' . 
  the fact that our government does n't control everyone 's healthcare like you 're accustomed to in your country does n't mean the us has no health care . 
  the vast majority of americans are insured and receive excellent care . 
  and the majority of people without health care insurance receive some form of socialized care such as medicare , medicaid , or chip . 
  `` no healthcare '' . 
  how brainwashed can europeans possibly be ? 
   and no free education 1 ) the average american is highly educated . 
  americans have the [ highest rate of secondary education completion ] ( http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/details/education/high-school-graduation-rate.aspx ) out of developed countries . 
  and secondary education is free . 
  2 ) americans have the [ 2nd highest attainment rate of university-level education ] ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/090908/t090908b1-eng.htm ) and [ american universities are the best in the world in academic performance . ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/arwu2014.html ) . 
  you brag about `` free education '' while a much smaller percentage of your country 's population actually goes to a university . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  ** 31 % ** of americans receive university-level educational attainment , compared to only ** 16 % ** of french people . 
  how much is your free education working out for you ? 
  3 ) the us leads the world in [ technological advancement ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/fieldeng2014.html ) 4 ) look at the rankings of world universities in [ natural sciences and mathematics ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/fieldsci2016.html ) . 
  15 of the top 20 universities are american . 
  only 4 are european , for example .
