   and second there are no viable alternatives . 
  well there it is . 
  there are n't any viable alternatives , you 're right . 
  is that really because of big evil american companies doing something dirty or is there some other reason ? 
  maybe european countries and others are slacking ? 
  people might be able to make the case that companies like microsoft , google , and apple have anti-competitive practices but could you say the same about reddit ? 
  what shady stuff have they done to shut out alternatives ? 
  why is n't there a viable european alternative to reddit ? 
  maybe the us has qualities that europe lacks and that is why american companies are so innovative and successful ? 
  maybe europe should see this disparity as a reason to improve things in europe , foster innovation and compete instead of thinking that european success in it can only be achieved by waging a war against american companies ? 
  crabs in a bucket . 
  you say all that and yet you 're on an american site right now . 
  you 're talking tough as some europeans do about this topic , but i doubt you will act in a way to back up what you 're saying . 
  i doubt you really want to live life without using reddit , youtube , facebook , or any product from google , apple , microsoft , ibm , intel , amd , nvidia etc. . . all of which are american . 
  instead of lashing out at american companies because they 're playing the game more effectively and outperforming european companies , europeans should compete and try to develop competing , alternative technologies or new technologies of their own . 
  maybe leaders in europe realize that they ca n't so their solution is to penalize american companies for having the moxie to be better . 
  that 's called protectionism . 
  if you want to play the game that way you 're going to lose , because europe is waaaaay more dependent on american tech , especially in it and software , than the us is on european tech . 
  well , that 's just weird . 
  they left turkey , ostensibly because turkey sucks , and they move to a western country and use their newfound freedom of expression to support a tyrant in their home country . 
  that 's so insanely idiotic that i 'm at a loss for words to describe exactly how i feel about it . 
   the us prints the world 's reserve country . 
  if it never has to pay back its debt , it can just keep it up and let inflation eat it . 
  nope . 
  the us pays principle and interest on us bonds , always has . 
  it 's not really `` debt '' it 's an investment . 
  the debt is n't a single lump sum of outstanding debt owed to external parties that has to be paid back whenever they want . 
  that 's not how it works . 
   then , the rest of the world is effectively subsidizing it . 
  again , no .

  it 's like you 're incapable of seeing anything about the us in a way that is n't belittling or unrealistically negative .

  do you know the reason why europeans get away with continually under-funding their militaries today ? 
  it 's a country on a separate continent , whose people europeans constantly bash and love nothing more than to pretend they 're better than . 
  you 're making the mistake a lot of europeans make and germans specifically . 
  you 're so accustomed to living under a blanket of protection provided by the us that you take it for granted and do n't have a realistic understanding of the situation . 
  you 're pathologically incapable of giving the us credit for pretty much anything . 
  you 're actually unaware of how dependent europe is on the us because anti-americanism does n't permit anything positive to be said about the us , especially if it would be inconvenient to your pride and your undeserved sense of superiority over the us .

  if europe ca n't even intervene within europe to stop the serbs and you 're acting like it 's the us who ca n't fight a `` real war '' , what then do you think europeans are capable of ? 
  you 're trying to belittle a country 's military that you 're almost entirely militarily dependent on . 
  it 's absolutely hilarious . 
   instead of turning up late ah , you 're one of those europeans who thinks wwii was going swimmingly for the allies before the us entered the war . 
  that 's hilarious . 
  you have to rewrite history to avoid giving the us credit . 
  the allies were losing on every front in every theater of war in wwii . 
  the us did n't join late , it was the us joining that caused the war to end when it did and how it did . 
   or bullying 3rd world countries . 
  you mean the same thing europeans have been doing , bullying weaker nations , for centuries ? 
  such europe . 
  so superior .
