  the fact that our government does n't control everyone 's healthcare like you 're accustomed to in your country does n't mean the us has no health care . 
  the vast majority of americans are insured and receive excellent care . 
  and the majority of people without health care insurance receive some form of socialized care such as medicare , medicaid , or chip . 
  `` no healthcare '' . 
  how brainwashed can europeans possibly be ? 
   and no free education 1 ) the average american is highly educated . 
  americans have the [ highest rate of secondary education completion ] ( http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/details/education/high-school-graduation-rate.aspx ) out of developed countries . 
  2 ) the us public education system brings people of each specific demographic up to a higher standard of learning than they 'd receive in any other country except finland .

  ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/arwu2014.html ) 4 ) the us leads the world in [ technological advancement ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/fieldeng2014.html ) 5 ) look at the rankings of world universities in [ natural sciences and mathematics ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/fieldsci2016.html ) . 
  15 of the top 20 universities are american . 
  only 4 are european , for example . 
  american universities similarly dominate in specific fields like [ physics ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectphysics2015.html ) , [ chemistry ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectchemistry2015.html ) and [ computer science ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectcs2015.html ) . 
  you do n't agree with someone 's political views so you just keep saying they 're making a bad `` arguement '' . 
  nice alternate account by the way . 
  while pretending i do n't know what it is , you just called it `` godwin 's fallacy '' when everyone knows it as `` godwin 's law '' . 
  you are all over the place . 
  it 's incredible how at every turn you 've failed to construct a single cogent point and everything you 've just said has appeared to be nothing more than the random output of a diseased mind . 
  you made a false quote to misrepresent my argument because you could n't actually understand it let alone rebut it without creating a straw man . 
  then you say i 'm arguing like a child . 
  take your history seriously . 
  do n't punish people for expressing themselves . 
  of nazis start attacking people , deal with that . 
  do n't arrest people because they made a gesture with their hand . 
  you have bigger issues to deal with , and you can deal with those issues without morally ambiguous steps to impose your will on others and violate their rights . 
  this is a thread about people being arrested for doing nazi salutes you oblivious child . 
  hitler was democratically elected . 
  every single comment you 've made so far just proves how narrow and incoherent your understanding of this topic is . 
   defending a pointless opinion it 's your opinion that my opinion is pointless . 
  do you not see how inane your argument is right now ? 
   you must argue for your view to have merit , not cry when nobody takes it seriously just because it is yours . 
  this is not just my opinion . 
  this is a side of a large debate about the importance of free expression and the role of government in limiting it . 
  there are a lot of people who oppose governments that punish nonviolent political expression . 
   which is what you are doing now . 
  the irony is incredible . 
   `` if they can do it , why ca n't we ? '', 
  that does n't accurately describe my position whatsoever . 
   a child could explain the reason your arguement is empty . 
  your argument makes no sense . 
   your view has no image merit simply because it is yours . 
  my view does n't lack merit simply because you do n't agree with it . 
   if your view is without merit , others will mock it . 
  and people like you will convince yourselves that other people 's views lack merit simply because you 're not mentally equipped to deal with them , because your understanding of the underlying topics is completely myopic and one-sided . 
  [ tyranny of the majority . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyranny_of_the_majority ) if you believe in fundamental rights like free expression that supersede public whims , then it does n't matter if the majority of people think you do n't have the right to express yourself in a way they do n't approve , you still have that right . 
  what if tomorrow the majority of people decided that it should be illegal for you to express * your * views ? 
  in fact , we can switch this around and say that jews rights were taken from them in germany because the majority of germans decided that jews did n't have the same rights native , ethnic germans had . 
  but `` more people '' thought the jews did n't deserve rights , right ? 
  the us has a much better view of free expression than europeans do . 
  i have no problem admitting this and i do n't care if it irritates people . 
  when you allow the government to determine what is or is n't acceptable speech , barring the kinds that directly cause violence , it creates a slippery slope and creates a legal pretext to continue on that path and start other forms of speech . 
  you start using the excuse to ban dissent and silence people 's political views . 
   even the poor working class americans have a high quality of life , certainly not worse than european working classes . 
  in fact , people in the bottom 10 % of the us have as much wealth as people in the middle class of the average oecd nation . 
  the people in the poorest 10 % in the us tend to be about as individually wealthy as people in the french middle class , for example . 
  i did n't say people should break the law , i said that it should n't be a law in the first place . 
  it 's incredible how incapable some people like you are of logically dealing with opposing views . 
  you say i 'm a troll because i think it 's stupid to arrest people for engaging in nonviolent expressions . 
  that 's how myopic your political views are . 
  `` this american does n't agree with a social norm i 'm accustomed to . 
  hey everyone , troll him back ! '', 
  that 's basically the purpose of your comment . 
  ah yes , chinese tourists doing the nazi salute as a joke totally empowers nazis in germany to push the country back into genocidal fascism . 
  lol . 
  struggling with the far right ? 
  you mean hysteria in the media in which anyone who is n't politically correct is depicted as a nazi ? 
  the freedom to express yourself is more important than the freedom to not have your feelings hurt or be offended . 
  it 's not a perfect determining factor , but it is related . 
  but we 're not talking about quality of life . 
  we 're talking about economic output . 
  but if you want to go segue into that topic , you should familiarize yourself with the fact that the us actually in general has very high quality of life and europeans have a very unrealistically negative view of the us that is bordering on the insane . 
  the us has [ higher quality of life ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp ) than the vast majority of the eu . 
  the us ranked # 9 and belgium is ranked # 23 , for example . 
  also [ atlanta , georgia ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/in/atlanta ) in the us specifically has higher quality of life than [ brussels , belgium . 
  ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/in/brussels ), 
  doing the nazi salute in public in germany is stupid . 
  arresting people for doing the nazi salute in public in germany is stupid as well . 
  georgia is n't thought of as a rich state in the us but it has a higher gdp per capita than belgium . 
  georgia gdp per capita : [ $ 44,700 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_gdp_per_capita ) belgium gdp per capita : [ $ 41,000 ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=belgium+gdp+per+capita&amp;oq=belgium+gdp+per+capita&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2731j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ), 
   i just love how all americans ever do in this subreddit is redirect everything to be about belittling europeans . 
  how do you not realise why we hate you ? 
  you 're just trying to justify the fact that your worldview is pathetic . 
  you say hypocritical , moronic shit about the us and then when americans call you out on it you go `` this is why we hate you ! '', 
  that way you can convince yourself you win , either way . 
  either americans have to allow you to parade your insecurity-fueled propaganda about the us with impunity , or americans challenge you and then you say that them criticizing you justifies your anti-americanism in the first place . 
  what a pathetic , pathological view of the us you have . 
   economically we have a much lower poverty rate wrong . 
  eu poverty rate : [ 16.4 % ] ( http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/spip.php?article99&amp;lang=fr ) us poverty rate : [ 13.5 % ] ( http://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-current-poverty-rate-united-states ) also : euro area unemployment rate : [ 9.1 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/unemployment-rate ) us unemployment : [ 4.3 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate )  politically our electoral systems are so much more democratic than yours nope . 
  for the most part , european nations elect members of parliament who appoint their prime minister . 
  in the us we elect both our legislators in congress and directly elect our president  militarily we actually equal you in everything but oil and nukes , and i believe aircraft carriers . 
  how delusional can you possibly be ? 
  all of the militaries of europe combined only have [ 10 % ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/02/19/germanys-army-is-so-under-equipped-that-it-used-broomsticks-instead-of-machine-guns/?utm_term=.c6f449e8aff7 ) of the military capability the us has . 
   culturally , what , you invented jeans and do a few movies ? 
  and invented pretty much every modern form of music . 
  blues , jazz , rock and roll , hip hop etc. . we 're 5 % of the earth 's population , have only been a country for about 250 years and have about [ half of the best selling authors of all time . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_best-selling_fiction_authors )  you 'll find that half of them were written and directed by europeans . 
  every single thing you 've said so far has been complete nonsense . 
  congratulations , you 're a perfect example of why americans dismiss european anti-americanism as being the deranged behavior of pathetic idiots . 
  meanwhile only 2 % of american workers are minimum wage workers .
