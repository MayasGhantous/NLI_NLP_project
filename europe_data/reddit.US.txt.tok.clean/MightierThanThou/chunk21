  the vast majority of americans have higher wages than the vast majority of europeans . 
  every single thing you just said , you made up on the spot . 
  and i can flip it around and mention how hard it is to get good vietnamese or thai food in europe , while that stuff is all over the us . 
  there is stuff in europe that is n't as readily available in the us , but there is also stuff in the us that is n't readily available in europe . 
  but with that said , it 's more common to have access to european food in the us than it is to have access to american food in europe . 
  and that 's not because american food sucks , it 's because of european protectionism . 
   i do n't want to fuel the anti-us circlejerk , but i moved from europe to the us a few months ago , here are my observations : out of my 28 years on this planet , i lived in europe for 4 years . 
  germany , uk , finland , and visited several other countries . 
   cheese is much worse that in europe . 
  also , you miss the specialty cheeses of europe . 
  first off , european cheese is available in the us . 
  secondly , while the us has a basic cheese market consisting of cheese that is more bland and cheaper , there are artisan , specialty cheeses made in the us as well . 
  bergenost for example , made in new york , is my favorite cheese . 
  it 's amazing . 
   you miss the specialty meats of europe : pastrama , prosciutto etc. 
  this is right up my alley . 
  i freaking love italian cured meats like capocollo , prosciutto , genoa salami etc. . . 
  i regularly buy the stuff in the us . 
  much of it imported from europe and i 've bought versions of those meats that are made in the us that are just as good , and sometimes much cheaper . 
   bread is worse in general , but there are a few expensive brands that are fine the mass produced white sandwich bread in the us is definitely pretty bad if you 're into bread , but a lot of grocery stores have bakeries that make fresh bread every day and you can get great stuff for very cheap , cheaper than a specialty bakery . 
  also there are french bakeries all over where i live . 
  shit is expensive though and run by intolerable hipsters who jack up their prices because their establishments are considered hip . 
  they sell macarons for $ 3 each . 
  fuck that . 
   when it comes to veal , the eu has much more stringent requirements in terms of animal welfare than the us ; requiring group housing beyond eight weeks of age and fibrous rations beyond two weeks of age . 
  some countries like the uk have even tighter regulations . 
  the practice is horrifying either way . 
  people need to stop eating veal so that industry can die . 
  also if the eu has more stringent animal welfare regulations , how do you explain bullfighting in spain ? 
  that 's one of the most disgusting things in the world . 
  it 's not even remotely defensible in a way that you might defend veal , because it 's food , because they 're torturing an animal for entertainment . 
   i agree , but only if it 's the chunky kind . 
  chunky peanut butter is an abomination and frankly , your blasphemy offends me . 
  also , something like they to pretend never happened , europeans wanted to bicker and force reparations on the defeated countries after wwii in the exact manner they did after wwi . 
  after wwi the us was n't powerful enough to stop this , even though the us vocally opposed europeans exacting revenge on each other . 
  after wwii though , the us emerged from the conflict in such a position of power that it intervened and prevented the british and french from treating germany like shit , yet again . 
  german nationalism in the run up to wwii was largely a result of being abused by the french and british after wwi . 
  the europeans did n't learn their lesson , but the us https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monnet_plan the french literally wanted to steal german land to boost the french economy after wwii . 
  the us prevented them from doing this . 
  the us did the most to liberate western europe from the germans , rebuilt europe free of charge after wwii , prevented europeans from fragmenting into rivals in economic warfare , protected them from soviet encroachment , lovingly nurtured european unity , and europeans today basque in their unity and anti-americanism . 
  it 's one of the most ironic developments in modern human history . 
  not as barbaric as veal or foie gras , both of which being very common in europe and not in the us . 
  also , nutella sucks and peanut butter is superior . 
  fight me . 
  [ nutella , a european food , consists mostly of sugar and palm oil .

  the us ranks # 1 in the world in the [ global food security index ] ( http://foodsecurityindex.eiu.com/country/details#united%20states ) , and ranks # 3 in the quality and safety category specifically , higher than every eu nation except france . 
   incapable at forging a new national identity for their dream state , that they have to make america the scary foreign boogeyman to unite everybody around ? 
  yes . 
  support for the eu is very closely linked to a negative view of the us , or a view that the us needs to be usurped as a superpower . 
  other than that , the us is so prominent that it makes europeans insecure so they overcompensate by having an undeserved sense of superiority . 
  it 's an inferiority complex that they are coping with , because of how much power and influence the us has had over europe economically , politically , militarily , and culturally . 
  which does n't stop smug europeans from making grandiose assertions . 
  the comment that started this was : `` you know , we are just weak with our disease and hormone free food !, 
  not to even talk about healthcare ... '' was that person just talking about eggs , or were they using a small , narrow bit of information to add to a larger narrative that they want to be true , namely that the eu has safer food than the us ? 
  newsflash : the eu has higher rates of salmonella than the us does , and the us ranks # 1 in the [ global food security index ] ( http://foodsecurityindex.eiu.com/country/details#united%20states ) and # 3 in quality and safety , which means the us has higher quality , safer food than the vast majority of europe . 
  despite the lack of overbearing regulations like the eu has , the us actually [ has lower rates of infection from salmonella ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6rluwc/til_that_due_to_eu_regulations_eu_eggs_are_about/dl647oh/ ) than the eu does , and the us ranks # 1 in the [ global food security index ] ( http://foodsecurityindex.eiu.com/country/details#united%20states ) and ranks # 3 in the quality and safety category . 
  in fact , the us has actually a lower rate of salmonella infection than the eu does as someone proved in [ this comment . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6rluwc/til_that_due_to_eu_regulations_eu_eggs_are_about/dl647oh/ ), 
  that might put a damper on the circle-jerk . 
  also should be mentioned that the general narrative that american food sucks is nonsense , and is usually just a shell game . 
  the hysteria about gmo and american food in general is not to protect people from unsafe food , it 's to make people in europe scared , and smug about how much the us sucks , so that they 'll support laws that protect entrenched european businesses from competition with american businesses . 
  the us [ leads the world in biotechnology . 
  ] ( http://www.oecd.org/innovation/inno/keybiotechnologyindicators.htm ) some information on that : 1 ) [ biotechnology r&d expenditures in the business sector . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h9m7ho9.jpg ) 2 ) [ world share of biotechnology patents . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y5orb42.jpg ) also , the us ranks # 1 in the world in the [ global food security index ] ( http://foodsecurityindex.eiu.com/country/details#united%20states ) , and ranks # 3 in the quality and safety category specifically , higher than every eu nation except france . 
  the us provides typically higher quality food products at lower prices than just about everyone else . 
  that is why there is so much propaganda about american food products being terrible , people are creating a public perception to steer people away from buying food from their competitors , and supporting laws that directly shut out competition . 
  it 's negative marketing and many europeans have seemingly fallen for it . 
  if you save someone from a heart attack and then they overdose on cocaine years later , it does n't mean that the initial medical treatment was n't effective . 
  they could have died earlier . 
  not a perfect analogy but i 'm sure you 'll understand it . 
  greece 's current economic problems do n't mean that the marshall plan did n't succeed in boosting their economy . 
  in fact , it 's very likely that greece would have faced earlier , more severe economic problems without the aid they received during the cold war . 
  your comment is hilarious for a couple of reasons . 
  1 ) russia already has already provided arms to those countries . 
  2 ) us troops are not currently fighting against and occupying any of those countries . 
   it 's another thing for a country with an economy half of california 's to warn us i knew that california by itself is one of the biggest economies in the world , and that russia 's economy is anemic but i did n't think your claim could be true . 
  then i did some quick googling and ... california gdp : $ 2.6 trillion ( 2016 ) russia gdp : $ 1.3 trillion ( 2016 ) half . 
  you were right . 
  texas and new york state are bigger economies than russia , as well . 
  that 's kind of hilarious on one hand , but also impressive that russia , a country whose economy is dwarfed by its rivals , is still a thorn in our sides and a major geopolitical and military force . 
  the marshall plan was partially intended to flood europe with so much aid and boost economic growth to the point that europeans would n't be bickering about reparations after wwii . 
  poland was under the thumb of the soviets after wwii so they were n't allowed to accept any aid from the us . 
  it 's logical to conclude that if eastern european countries like poland received marshall plan aid , there 'd be less of a disparity in wealth and economic output compared to western europe , and poland might not care about reparations today . 
  so ... this is russia 's fault . 
  kinda . 
   friend and ally whose friends spread wahhabism in europe you have the tunnel vision that a lot of anti-americans have . 
  you 're acting as if the us is the only nation with a cozy relationship with saudi arabia . 
  you criticize the us and the us alone . 
   is going to sell 200 billion of weapons to ksa there is a long list of large arms deals between eu nations and the saudis . 
  [ in 2012 , the eu was the largest supplier of arms to saudi arabia . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/eu-makes-controversial-weapons-sales-to-saudi-arabia-a-822288.html ) but fuck the us and the us alone , right ? 
   and whose wars are the reason there is a migrant crisis . 
  the majority of migrants flooding into europe are economic migrants , not victims of us wars . 
   who needs enemies with a friend like this ? 
  [ a friend who europe depends on for defense ? 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/10013197/america-our-great-protector-is-looking-the-other-way.html ) the us has been subsidizing and directly contributing to the defense of europe and european interests since wwii , you know , that war which shortly after which the us rebuilt europe for free and lovingly nurtured european unity via nato and other institutions . 
  in fact , the us was one of the biggest driving forces in the creation of the eu itself . 
  a large number of nazi forces in wwii were conscripts from eastern europe , also a bunch from western europe as well which might surprise people .
