  on d-day for example , some of the beaches were defended by static occupational divisions that were made up of young or old slavic conscripts . 
  they were poorly trained and poorly equipped for combat . 
  they were used to put down unrest in france , they were n't intended as front line troops . 
  `` i ai n't got no panties on '' . 
  what i find funny is that the current , general consensus on reddit about russia is that putin sucks and the russian government does shady shit . 
  no more than 4 or 5 years ago , left-leaning people on reddit , americans , europeans , and canadians , were constantly defending putin and circle-jerking , in support , whenever russia said anything critical of the us . 
  there were legit memes that praised putin . 
  it was right around the same time that reddit had a boner for hugo chavez . 
  it 's funny to see how the narrative on reddit evolves , and how people have at certain times allowed their political biases to make them put their support behind dictators . 
  in fact , i remember that one of the running themes was that americans who called putin a dictator were downvoted and lambasted for being brainwashed idiots . 
  in high school i dated a girl from romania . 
  her dad was previously in the military in romania and her mom was a school teacher . 
  the dad did n't speak english very well but the mother did and when i went over to their house she would tell me some incredible shit about what it was like living in the country under communism . 
  the general theme was a constant feeling of fear . 
  no dissent was allowed . 
  people that criticized the government , even casually , or showed anything resembling subversive behavior , would get threatening letters in the mail or would disappear . 
  often they 'd come back to their families , subdued and pacified , but some people would be gone for good . 
  their family came to the us right before the fall of communism in romania , after the father retired from his military service . 
  at first the whole family was n't allowed to leave the country at the same time . 
  the father could only come to the us if the mother was still in romania . 
  this was basically a way to prevent him from defecting . 
  after the revolution the entire family moved to california . 
  even after romania was no longer communist , and everyone in the family was safe in the us , the father was constantly paranoid that he was being watched by communist agents . 
  the mother told me a story about how he was at a grocery store , in san francisco , and saw two men watching him . 
  he left the store without buying anything , got in his car , and the two men both got in a car and followed him for a few miles . 
  i do n't know if he was actually being tailed , but even if he was n't it shows how much paranoia people had . 
  the dude was living in the us and his former communist government was deposed , but he still felt like he was in danger . 
  you 're probably right , but i 'm mad at you anyway . 
  let us dream . 
   by d-day 1944 the german front line was pushed back into poland . 
  [ axis-held territory in europe two months before d-day . 
  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/66/29/c4/6629c4e706e6bcc7e3e4ffa70d165f08--nazi-party-fakta.jpg ) the vast majority of territory the germans/italians gained control of in europe had not been liberated by the time d-day took place . 
   lend-lease to the ussr was overwhelmingly used in supply or reserves and equally non-influential . 
  interesting theory ( see : complete bullshit ) . 
  allow me to retort : ** [ ` the united states is a country of machines . 
  without the use of these machines through lend-lease , we would lose this war . ', 
  -- josef stalin \\ ( 1943 \\ ) ] ( http://www.amazon.com/russias-life-saver-lend-lease-u-s-s-r-world/dp/0739145630 ) ** checkmate . 
  but let me rub it in a bit more : [ the us absolutely outproduced the soviets during wwii . 
  the us economic output during the war was several times larger than that of the ussr . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_production_during_world_war_ii#gdp ) the soviet gdp by the end of the war only peaked at $ 340 billion . 
  the us gdp peaked at $ 1.5 trillion . 
  [ the us produced almost 7000 naval vessels during wwii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_production_during_world_war_ii#naval_forces ) . 
  the soviets only produced 81 . 
  [ the us produced 324,000 aircraft . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_production_during_world_war_ii#air_forces ) the soviets only produced 136,000 . 
  also it was n't just finished military equipment production that everyone depended on the us for , but raw materials the soviets used to build their military equipment came from the us in the first place . 
  [ look at resource production during wwii \\ ( coal , iron ore , and oil \\ ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_production_during_world_war_ii#resources ) stalin , the last person who would benefit politically from giving the us credit , was forced to give the us credit , because of how unquestionably essential the us was to the ussr during wwii . 
  only after wwii did the soviets and delusional westerners begin to pretend that the us did n't absolutely turn the tide of the war and turn a certain allied defeat into an equally certain allied victory . 
  the us provided the allies , including the soviets , with the majority of their war material . 
  the us did this while supplying its own gigantic military at the same time , fighting extensively in every theater of war , and fighting japan on the other side of the planet while leading the western allies in n. africa , the med , italy , and western europe . 
  in the full spectrum of the conflict , the us was the most important contributor to allied victory . 
  if you deny this you 're either demonstrating ignorance or dishonesty . 
  the soviets only began to make real offensive progress after us-provided war aid began flooding in , and after the us opened the second front in europe ( something canadians and brits failed to do on their own without the us , in the disaster later euphemistically called the ` dieppe raid '' ) . 
  the soviets would have run out of steam without us war aid and without the us opening the western front which relieved pressure from the eastern front . 
  dozens of german divisions left the eastern front in preparation for and in response to the us-led invasion of france . 
   the us was simply not important to the outcome of ww2 in europe . 
  if you said that in the company of any honest person educated on the matter you 'd be laughed at . 
  you 're rewriting history , robbing the us of credit for its contributions , in order to accommodate your current political biases . 
  you prefer to believe lies because they feel better to you than the truth . 
  the truth is that the allies were losing miserably before the us entered the war , that includes in the european theater , and includes the soviets themselves who were getting pretty much stomped until us began bankrolling and supplying them . 
  the soviets made almost zero offensive progress until the us entered the war . 
  compelling counterargument !, 
   with some actual fact what 's that `` actual fact '' in your mind ? 
  the myth that americans sat around while france won our independence for us even though the biggest blow to the british in the american revolution occurred before france had even committed to assist the us directly ? 
   and what a shocker , americans first offensive is mostly american , quell surprise . 
  it was n't america 's first offensive , and it was n't the last major operation in which the us did most of the work . 
  in response to me pointing out facts , you 're saying a bunch of stuff that is completely untrue . 
  the us had already fought extensively in n. africa , the med , and italy , and did this while fighting japan on the other side of the world in the asia-pacific region with very little assistance from the allies the us was assisting in and around europe . 
   they just like to play centre stage when in fact the european powers and russia were fighting long before the americans decided to actually put boots on the ground . 
  in wwi there was a stalemate , the us ended the stalemate . 
  in wwii the allies were losing on every front in every theater of war . 
  the us reversed the trend . 
  the allies were losing in wwii before the us entered the conflict . 
  acting like the us just joined at the end is one of the most perfect examples of the sheer insanity of anti-americanism , especially considering how important american involvement was in causing the war to end * when * it did and * how * it did . 
   america had the luxury after ww2 of not being bombed to shit to have their own economic miracle and now sits as a world power thanks to its timely intervention in europe more revisionism . 
  people can not give the us auspicious credit for anything . 
  anything . 
  you 're regurgitating the myth that the us only became a major economic power because it capitalized on wwii . 
  that is absolutely , insanely idiotic and false . 
  [ the us had the largest economy in the world in the world as far back as 1913 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_regions_by_past_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) #world _ 1 . e2 .80.932003 _ .28 maddison .29 ) in [ 1938 ] ( http://www.mnstarfire.com/ww2/history/economic/gdp1938.html ) , before the us entered wwii , the us economy was over twice as large as the next largest economy . 
  us gdp : ** $ 800 billion ** ussr gdp : ** $ 359 billion . 
  ** you 're doing two things by parroting that myth . 
  1 ) belittling us contributions in wwii by depicting the us as having unfairly benefited from it , therefore it somehow does n't count . 
  the us did n't suffer , therefore it ca n't be given credit . 
  and 2 ) you 're trying to act like the us became an economic power because of wwii , because everyone else was handicapped by war . 
  you ca n't accept that the us became a major power on its own merits . 
  anti-americanism is a straight up mental disorder . 
  it 's incredible how many people like you have views that are based on lies and a deliberate , persistent need to distort the hell out of any topic the us is involved it to appeal to your biases . 
   after the other world powers put the rubble back together . 
  you mean , the us put the rubble back together . 
  the us planned , financed , and supplied the power-war reconstruction in europe and japan . 
  it was american expertise that converted war-torn countries into successful , capitalist economies . 
  access to the us market and us financing was responsible for most of immediate postwar growth in europe and japan . 
  no , every time the american revolution is mentioned on reddit people act like americans did nothing and france did all the work . 
  every us independence day on reddit becomes a circle-jerk by non-americans gloating about how americans have no right to celebrate . 
  submissions are created for that purpose , every time . 
  americans pointing out that the us did the most to liberate france in wwii is just the thing that grabs your attention , because of your biases . 
  you 're accustomed to the us being robbed for credit for its accomplishments and you 're not accustomed to the us being treated positively or even fairly .
