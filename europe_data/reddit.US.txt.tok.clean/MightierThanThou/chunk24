  sue me . 
  yup . 
  all the people inside would have generated moisture through their breath and perspiration and this would have formed small clouds inside and there 'd actually be rain . 
  pretty crazy to think about . 
  the dome would have been so big that it would have its own weather . 
  so here 's the funny thing , i 'm both jewish of heritage and german of heritage . 
  my great grandpa on my mom 's side fought for germany in wwi and my grandpa , his son , fought against germany in wwii in the us army . 
  most of my family left germany before the holocaust so when they came to the us they were both culturally jewish and german . 
  it 's hard to boycott your own culture . 
  the reichstag is a significant location in wwii history . 
  the germans defended it desperately and the soviets assaulted it and raised their flag on the roof and photographed it in an iconic way . 
  the reichstag is definitely a ww2 tourist sight . 
   i wouldnt call the reichstag a ww2 sight tbh uh ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raising_a_flag_over_the_reichstag, 
  am jewish , have worn hugo boss . 
  edit : also i own a ford mustang even though henry ford was purportedly a fan of hitler and not too keen on teh jewz . 
  i 've been to austria , slovenia , and hungary and completely neglected croatia . 
  i could have gone to croatia but my group decided not to , for whatever reason . 
  after i already flew home i saw a travel documentary about croatia that showed a bunch of towns and it looked incredible . 
  the coastal towns in croatia looked nicer than italy . 
  from people i know who have been to croatia , they said the food and wine are amazing . 
  also , i have 3 handguns that were manufactured in croatia and they are incredibly high quality . 
  pretty impressive for a small country . 
  there was a documentary about nazi concept architecture on the history channel in the us several years ago . 
  it was pretty cool seeing the cgi models of what berlin would have looked like . 
  the nazis were going to build the biggest dome in human history and loads of other insanely massive buildings . 
  interestingly , berlin actually is n't a great place for massive construction because the land is soft and marshy or something , so the nazis would have had to devise engineering solutions to deal with it and they were actually working on that problem well into wwii , which was a waste of resources that might have contributed to their defeat to some degree . 
  the germans were literally working on vanity projects while they were losing territory and their boys were getting killed in huge numbers all across europe . 
  that 's how strong the propaganda was . 
  i 've been to berlin twice but never to that place . 
  i did n't go wwii sightseeing at all aside from seeing the reichstag . 
   nobody likes juggernauts and one must realize that the us became the one only after 50,000,000 people died and because more cynical inhabitants of the world wars age had no nuclear weapons to solve the problem of atlantic ocean . 
  the us was well on its way to becoming a superpower long before wwii . 
  the us had the largest economy in the world , by far , right before wwi . 
  the us was a hotbed of breakthroughs in science and technology since the turn of the century , in fact . 
  also , right before wwii the us economy was twice as large as the next largest economy ( the ussr ) . 
  people like to pretend that the only reason the us became a superpower is because everyone else got bombed to hell in the world wars . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  architecture too . 
  if hitler 's orgiastic vision for the third reich came true , they would have had some incredible buildings . 
  also their uniforms were pretty snazzy . 
  do you realize that the person i replied to said that europeans hope the us collapses ? 
  it 's completely rational for me to point out the fact that the person who said that is using us technology to make that statement . 
  [ american universities lead the world in every field . 
  ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/arwu2014.html ) look at the rankings of world universities in [ natural sciences and mathematics ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/fieldsci2016.html ) . 
  15 of the top 20 universities are american . 
  only 4 are european , for example . 
  american universities similarly dominate in specific fields like [ physics ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectphysics2015.html ) , [ chemistry ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectchemistry2015.html ) and [ computer science ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/subjectcs2015.html ) . 
  the us does [ 78 % ] ( http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/sb118610945461187080 ) of global medical research , despite being only 5 % of the earth 's population and 20 % of its economic output . 
  [ eight of the top 10 medical advances in the past 20 years were developed or had roots in the u.s. 
  the nobel prizes in medicine and physiology have been awarded to more americans than to researchers in all other countries combined . 
  eight of the 10 top-selling drugs in the world were developed by u.s. 
  companies . 
  ] ( http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052748704130904574644230678102274 ) pretty sure the global medical and biotechnology community would mourn the loss of the us , considering literally the majority of medical advances take place in the us and are then shared with the world . 
  we live in the information age , which is founded almost entirely on american inventions . 
  to this day , the us dominates in information technology . 
  [ 8 of the top 15 it companies in the world are american ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_information_technology_companies ) . 
  none are european . 
  [ 7 of the top 9 software companies are american ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_software_companies ) . 
  two are european . 
  if the us collapsed , the world would experience a serious decline in technological and scientific progress . 
  i 'm always entertained when people on the internet fantasize about the us collapsing , because they 're doing this while using almost exclusively us technology to do so . 
  if it 's kebabs , it 's probably either tahini or tzatziki . 
  my ancestors cooked ( and ate , presumably ) native americans ? 
  that 's metal as fuck . 
  well , i 've been subscribed to / r/europe for about a year now and i 've seen countless submissions filled with countless comments in which people have said some incredibly angry and spiteful things about the uk and british people because of the result of their 2016 referendum . 
  the whole thing reminds me of messy breakups i 've seen in real life . 
  a domineering partner in a relationship gets rejected by their so , and instead of handling it sanely and maturely , they develop a sick and borderline psychotic grudge against them . 
  mainland europeans seem to be really , really bitter towards brits right now . 
  i 'm sorry you feel that way . 
  hmm . 
  i went through the us public education system , kindergarten through 12th grade and i have no recollection of being taught that we invented any of those foods . 
  the only foods that we actually assigned any sort of national ownership to were thanksgiving foods and we were taught that we only learned how to cook that shit because native americans taught us how . 
  this is an example of people being hypercritical of the us . 
  the way this story is depicted and dramatized basically makes it sound like the us , the country , claimed that it invented the sausage roll when really it was one single company in the us that just got bold with its advertising . 
  it 's pretty incredible to see how bitter people are about the uk voting to leave the eu . 
  europeans are incredibly vindictive , it seems . 
  uh , the us did n't invent the sausage roll but the us absolutely , positively did invent the internet . 
  people who claim otherwise are usually people who only have a basic , surface understanding of the history of the internet and do n't know the difference between it and the web . 
  ** edit : ** i 'm getting downvoted by people and i assume this is because they do n't believe that the us invented the internet . 
  i 'll take this opportunity to get educational : the internet is the [ internet protocol suite ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_protocol_suite ) , aka the tcp/ip protocol , invented by [ robert kahn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bob_kahn ) and [ vinton cerf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vinton_g._cerf ) , two americans working for the us military . 
  it 's the technology that actually transmits data . 
  it is the internet . 
  originally it was a us military network called [ arpanet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arpanet ) , when it was expanded to civilian and global use , it became the internet . 
  the web , which people confuse with the internet , came later . 
  the web is a system of code that is transmitted via the internet , that only serves to compile data and then display it in a visual interface in a browser . 
  tim berners-lee , a briton working at cern , took existing hypertext code ( [ invented by an american ] ( http://www.livinginternet.com/w/wi_nelson.htm ) ) and just created the first monolithic system of hypertext that became standard . 
  the internet is the more crucial technology . 
  the internet can function without the web , the web can not function without the internet . 
  giving credit to the europeans for the internet would be like taking credit for designing a car when all you did was paint the exterior . 
  the internet was invented by the us . 
  this is a fact . 
  deal with it . 
  americans do n't actually believe that pizza or sushi were invented in the us , but enjoy your karma for making a grandiose claim that is n't true but contributes to the circle-jerk . 
  i 'm amazed that the dude standing in the turret did n't get ejected like a ragdoll . 
  that was a pretty rapid deceleration . 
  via means `` through '' in latin . 
  people use the word incorrectly when they say `` via '' before the source or origin . 
  denmark was the midway point in the situation i 'm describing . 
  the germanic people went from point 1 ) what is now norway and sweden * via * point 2 ) denmark and ended up in point 3 ) mainland europe like what is now germany and so forth . 
  it is true if you consider the origin of the germanic people to be the nordic bronze age culture that originated in southern scandinavia and spread to mainland europe to areas we later called germania .
