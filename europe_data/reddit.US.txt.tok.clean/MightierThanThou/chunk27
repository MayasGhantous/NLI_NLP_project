   and how tf can america be worse than an openly oligarchic nation like russia ? 
  the vast majority of americans have more wealth than the vast majority of russians , even if there is a wider range of incomes in the us . 
  this will almost certainly get me downvoted , but what usually leads to income equality in a country is the demographical makeup of that country . 
  the us has by far the highest rate of minorities in the developed world . 
  this would put the us at a statistical disadvantage in income equality no matter what economic system or government policies the us had . 
  there are racial disparities in income in every other developed country , even in countries with extremely generous social services . 
  if nothing about the systems in those countries changed but they had a demographical shift to resemble the us , they 'd have more income inequality . 
  similarly , if nothing about the system in the us changed but its demographics shifted to more closely resemble other western nations , the us would have far less income inequality . 
  the only other western , developed country that even comes close to the us in terms of the percentage of the population that consists of ethnic minorities is canada , and canada 's minority rate is half the us minority rate . 
  even with the recent waves of migration to europe from north africa and the middle east , no western country has anywhere near the number of illegal immigrants from the third world that the us has . 
  people , due to their biases , want to take pleasure in the income inequality in the us , but they do n't want to admit that the us has a fundamentally different demographical situation that is a major cause of income inequality . 
  there are racial issues in the us that ca n't be solved by any amount of social welfare or national politics of any kind . 
  if you were to compare specific demographics in the us to those same demographics in other western countries , the income inequality situation in the us would n't look that bad at all . 
  i expect downvotes . 
  lol , an alt whose entire post history is replying to me or talking about me . 
  a person who thinks obsessing over a single user on reddit is a good use of time is telling me i 'm a basement dweller . 
  you totally owned me dude !, 
  you depend on your government for health care . 
  that makes you like soooo much better than americans , the vast majority of whom are insured and have [ faster ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/health_glance-2011-en/06/08/index.html;jsessionid=as008die826bn.delta?contenttype=&amp;itemid=/content/chapter/health_glance-2011-59-en&amp;containeritemid=/content/serial/19991312&amp;accessitemids=/content/book/health_glance-2011-en&amp;mimetype=text/html ) , [ more responsive care ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052748704130904574644230678102274?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fonline.wsj.com%2farticle%2fsb10001424052748704130904574644230678102274.html ) than canadians . 
  in fact , [ even uninsured americans have better care than canadians . 
  ] ( http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba596 ) you brag about your government-provided health care , gloating you depend on social services , and yet people in your government , including sitting prime ministers , [ come to the us for care . 
  ] ( http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba596 ) they apparently deserve better than they provide to you . 
  your former pm jean chretien , a liberal who publicly talked shit about the us health care system , later came to the mayo clinic in the us for health care while in office as the leader of your nation . 
  how does that make you feel ? 
  i 'll tell you how it should make you feel if you were honest and intelligent , it would make you feel that your fellow canadians are smug for no justifiable reason , but actually have developed this smugness as an overcompensation for being inferior to and dependent on the us in most ways . 
  the person you replied to made their comment while operating on pure bias and obliviousness . 
  in the real world , [ canada has the highest rate of homelessness in the entire developed world . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_homeless_population ) it is several times higher than that of the us . 
   i do n't need a special occasion to bash america . 
  it is fun every day if the week . 
  yup , that 's how you simplify a complicated world for your simple mind and use bashing the us as a way of distracting yourself from your own problems . 
   and yes , rich people give to charities in america to get tax benefits , that is well known . 
  and this is an extension of your need to bash the us . 
  you need a defense to facts that might cause you to otherwise admit something positive about the us if you were honest and rational and not blinded by your political bias . 
  [ the ** majority ** of americans give time and money to charity every year . 
  ] ( http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/u-k-group-ranks-u-s-most-charitable-nation/ ) it 's not just rich people . 
  people like you always need to resort to mental gymnastics and excuses to avoid acknowledging facts that do n't jive with your anti-americanism . 
   also really intresting to see that all those charities are connected to corporations . 
  even in your charities the capitalism shines through . 
  ah , since you have some weird , deranged opposition toward capitalism and have an ideological preference for government nanny states , that means that if capitalism results in charity it does n't count . 
  the fact that charities that are operated like corporations are the most successful probably fills you with ideological indignation . 
  `` but , capitalism is bad !, 
  waaaaa '' . 
   but if you do n't think that america is built on individualism where it is every man for them self you really hav n't seen much of the world . 
  if you do n't think that your entire view of the us is based on false propaganda designed to depict the us in always the most unrealistically negative way possible , then the propaganda has been effective and you no longer can think for yourself . 
  but please , go ahead and continue proceeding through life in an intellectual vacuum devoid of any opposition to beliefs that give you pleasure . 
  america = bad . 
  europe = good . 
  you 've already made up your mind and have no desire to be confused by pesky facts . 
  you believe americans are selfish individualists even though they 're just about the most generous people on the planet when it comes to giving time and money to charitable causes . 
  even when confronted with information that proves your views to be false , you do n't have the intellectual integrity to change your views . 
   with some even thinking charity is bad because it makes people less competitive .

  i think your trademark canadian inability to see your country critically is clouding your judgment . 
  canada has the highest rate of homelessness in the developed world . 
  canada 's rate of homelessness is higher than that of france , italy , and - shocker - the us . 
  canada has a higher rate of homelessness than the us does . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_homeless_population in fact , canada has the highest rate of homelessness in the entire developed world . 
  canada 's homelessness rate is .5 % of the population . 
  the us rate is .18 % how does that make you feel ? 
  do you still feel the powerful , undeserved sense of superiority that resulted in your ironic , delusional , hypocritical comment ? 
  hey , enjoy the upvotes you got . 
  smug canadians tend to be well received on reddit no matter how inane their comments about their country , and the us , tend to be . 
  you europeans are having an epic circle-jerk right now . 
  you 're using this topic to bash the us , and that is your goal , and logic and fairness are the last thing you care about when your main goal is to depict the us in an unrealistically negative way . 
  lots of mindless anti-americanism in these comments . 
  `` americans are selfish '' . 
  `` everyone else is an enemy ! '', 
  etc. . . 
  meanwhile in actuality , the us regularly tops the [ world giving index .

  quite the circle-jerk your comment started . 
  meanwhile , in the real world , the us regularly tops the [ world giving index .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wealthiest_charitable_foundations#wealthiest_foundations_.2f_donated_amount ) it 's funny how anti-americanism always ends up with people believing shit about americans that is the exact opposite of the truth . 
  people want to believe americans are selfish and their proof of this is that not all americans believe it 's the government 's job to redistribute wealth . 
  the fact that americans give more of their time and money to charity than pretty much anyone else is a better measure of generosity and empathy than bragging that your government is a mommy figure that you provides people 's livelihoods . 
  the thing is ... those mostly are local papers , not national papers . 
  they 're supposed to focus on local events . 
  and does that upset you ? 
  you realize that european anti-americanism by contrast is waaay more prevalent and extreme , right ? 
  do n't read too much into trump congratulating erdogan . 
  there 's a massive war going on in syria and there is no possible way that we could achieve any of our objectives there without turkey 's assistance . 
  honestly , i 'm having a hard time keeping informed about world events right now given how much other shit i have to occupy my mind with . 
  this polandball though seems to imply that france is about to do something crazy . 
  i assume this refers to le pen being possibly elected . 
  as i understand it , with my basic knowledge , le pen is not a fan of the eu or nato . 
  she 's a french nationalist who has a skeptical view of multinational organizations because she believes that french sovereignty supersedes everything else . 
  aside from that , what is so bad about her ? 
  i 've seen interviews she 's done and nothing she has said has been completely bonkers . 
  granted , i 'm not a european so the idea of european unity is not as important to me , but from what i 've seen she just seems like a traditional french nationalist in the same mold as people like charles de gaulle . 
  the funny thing is , i associate tony blair with george w. bush for obvious reasons and i 'm imagining bush getting involved in us politics right now and ... that 's just crazy . 
  anything bush touched in us politics right now would catch on fire . 
  he was pretty smart , actually . 
  the moment his presidency ended he pretty much went into hiding . 
  i 've heard of that dude like twice in the last 8 years . 
  i think it 's bizarre that tony blair would be , in anyway , involving himself in uk politics right now given the fact that he 's probably even less popular with brits than bush is with americans .
