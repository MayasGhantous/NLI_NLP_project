  nah , i 'm going to go ahead and overrule your objection and file it under `` irrelevant '' and also `` dishonest '' . 
  let 's look at how this unfolded : in response to trump correctly pointing out that the us shoulders the biggest financial burden for the nato alliance , that the vast majority of european nations do n't pay what they 're supposed to , you presented a graph about one very specific form of aid that the eu happens to contribute to more than the us as some sort of proof that trump is wrong . 
  that 's even though that specific form of aid is dwarfed by other forms of aid . 
  that 's even though when you contrast the money given in developmental aid to the huge amounts of money the us spends on defense that strengthens the nato alliance , your argument just generally falls apart and looks like it could only be uttered by someone who is either very dishonest or not terribly bright . 
   dropping `` freedom bombs '' from drones may be america 's preferred method , but there are other ways . 
  yes , there are other ways . 
  and in those other ways the us still contributes more than the eu does , as i showed . 
  emphasizing developmental aid alone is silly because of how those figures compare to other forms of aid . 
  this submission is really petty and is designed to deceive people for the purpose of creating one of those smug `` europe is better than the us '' circle-jerks that everyone is so fond of . 
  you could n't deal with trump criticizing european countries , no matter how valid his criticism was , so you created an invalid , obfuscating , and disingenuous counterpoint . 
  putin probably has a boner seeing two nato countries at each other 's throat . 
  is n't that pasta on the left pappardelle ? 
   right , because the point of the chart is to make a fair comparison in terms of government aid . 
  that 's funny because it does nothing of the sort . 
  it 's not a fair comparison at all . 
  it 's one very narrow , specific form of aid and is almost completely irrelevant in the context of the financial burden of military spending in nato . 
   by the way , europe has charities , too . 
  that overall are n't comparable in volume and scale to the charities in the us . 
  [ the us literally has the majority of the top charities in the world . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wealthiest_charitable_foundations#wealthiest_foundations_.2f_donated_amount ) the eu has a showing , but not much of one considering the fact that the eu has 200 million more people than the us and a collective gdp almost as large as that of the us . 
  number of charities in the top 36 : usa : 23 eu : 5, 
  that 's development aid . 
  aid given to governments by other governments . 
  it does n't include aid given by charities and non-profits , or any aid beyond government-to-government transfers for development . 
  right off the bat , that figure for the us does n't include the ~ [ $ 71 billion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_foreign_aid#usage_of_money_for_support ) in private assistance provided by entities within the us , or the [ $ 17 billion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_foreign_aid#amounts ) given in military assistance . 
  if the us gave a country a lot of money , but gave it to companies instead of directly to the government , that would n't be included . 
  your graph is very selective and i 'd say dishonest because that 's such a narrow criteria for determining which countries are actually contributing the most and are the most giving . 
  also it has basically nothing to do with what trump is talking about when he says `` fair share '' , which is military spending in nato , which is a waaay bigger financial burden than developmental aid . 
   it 's a good break from the general reddit , which feels very usa-centered and yet ... you brought up the us in a submission that has nothing to do with the us . 
  and the people who replied to you have mentioned americans several times . 
  `` omg i love how we 're all so sophisticated , fighting the usa-centric reddit !, 
  let 's start talking about how shitty americans are . 
  no irony . 
  lol ! '', 
   center of internet ? 
  [ global communications map . 
  ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m6u-swhzb2o/u5x0i0cuxmi/aaaaaaaadsm/ao17kv5kwoi/s1600/communications_global-traffic-map-2014-3000x2160.jpg ), 
  no , and i 'm just as surprised that i was gilded as you are . 
   again , do you think i 'm like ... supporting punitive trade sanctions or something ? 
  no , but you seem to be hesitant to admit that countries that tried to go that route and sanction the us would suffer and would only be hurting themselves due to how dependent they are on the us . 
   by the way - the european union is pretty close to as powerful an economic bloc as the usa . 
  it is slightly smaller , but in the same weight class . 
  the usa has 25.4 % of the world 's wealth and the eu has 22.8 % . 
  the eu has almost 200 million more people than the us ( [ 509 million ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/region/european-union ) vs [ 324 million ] ( http://www.census.gov/popclock/ ) ) , yet the us has a larger gdp . 
  us gdp : [ $ 18 trillion ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp ) eu gdp : [ $ 16.3 trillion ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/region/european-union ) the us punches above its weight economically compared to the eu . 
  us gdp per capita : [ $ 56,000 ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd ) eu gdp per capita : [ $ 33,300 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union ) that 's just raw numbers though , economic importance ca n't only be stated that way . 
  the eu if considered as one economic entity is huge and is close to rivaling the us in those terms , but the importance of the us is greater than just its gdp , the eu too , but the us more so . 
  in terms of driving global economic growth by innovating and initiating trends that result in advancements in science and technology , the us is way more important than the eu . 
  pretty much every novel business model that has been developed over the last several decades has originated in the us . 
  the eu is so far behind the us in it and software development it 's almost comical . 
  there are almost no viable european alternatives to microsoft , apple , google , intel , amd etc. . . 
  yes , and each nation in that hypothetical league of nation 's would experience an economic decline greater than whatever economic damage the us would experience . 
  this may come as a shock to you , but the us is actually one of the most self-sufficient countries in the world economically . 
  foreign trade is actually a pretty small percentage of our gdp . 
  also , and again , this may come as a shock to you , the us is actually one of the least indebted nations in the world . 
  pretty much every major developed nation has more external debt relative to their gdp than the us does . 
  1 ) [ the majority of us debt is owed to parties within the us , not to foreign countries . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2014/10/28/who-owns-the-most-u-s-debt/ ) 2 ) [ the us has a national wealth of almost $ 86 trillion . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_wealth ) so $ 6 trillion in foreign debt is minuscule by contrast . 
  the us is a very rich and self-reliant nation . 
  the us is 1/20th of the earth 's population but has over 1/3rd of its wealth . 
  the us has about as much wealth as the next 5 wealthiest nations combined . 
  3 ) [ the us is in less debt as a percentage of its gdp than pretty much all other western nations . 
  ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2012/03/27/the-worlds-biggest-debtor-nations.html?page=1 ) 4 ) the us only has $ 6 trillion in foreign debt but has invested [ $ 9.2 trillion ] ( https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/jl2619.aspx ) in foreign countries . 
   i was just saying that you seemed to think that sanctions would mean like a total boycott of all us goods and services or something , which is n't really how any of that would work . 
  i responded to this idea you have and you seem to have ignored it . 
  i 'll explain it again . 
  if a country engaged in economic warfare against the us in the manner that they were sanctioning the us , it would n't just end there . 
  the us would retaliate . 
  if the country stopped short of boycotting american it products themselves , the us could still freeze sales of it products and technology transfers to whatever nations enacted the sanctions . 
  this would cripple pretty much any nation 's economy . 
  it 's difficult to overstate how much economic leverage the us has over the world . 
  we do n't even have to discuss information technology alone , we can talk about how the us by itself has about as much wealth and the next 5 wealthiest nations in the world combined . 
  access to not only us technology , but access to the us consumer market is almost singularly important to any nation 's economy . 
  it 's pretty pathetic how if an american says anything about the us that could be construed as positive , no matter how factual it is , people like you have to convince yourselves that it 's the height of ignorance , something to be mocked . 
  that way you never have to deal with opposing views . 
  if a country tried to enact sanctions against the us , the us government would almost certainly respond with reciprocal sanctions of its own . 
  we live in the information age . 
  every developed nation is utterly dependent on it technology . 
  it is not an exaggeration to say that the us absolutely dominates the it industry . 
  the us gave birth to the information age and still rules it to this day . 
  the us has enormous economic leverage over pretty much everyone , because literally the majority of major it/software companies are american . 
  any country that willingly engaged in economic warfare against the us would lose spectacularly . 
  good luck sanctioning the single most important economic , technological power in the world . 
  let 's have a little experiment though . 
  even though it 's pretty much unthinkable for any country to sanction the us , you 're bold enough to talk tough so let 's see how you fare without using american products . 
  reddit is an american site . 
  literally the [ majority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_most_popular_websites ) of the top internet sites in the world are american . 
  google , youtube , yahoo , wikipedia , facebook etc. . . 
  the us is the [ origin of ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_protocol_suite ) and the [ center of ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_internet_hosts ) the internet . 
  the us comprises 5 % of the earth 's population but has literally the majority of internet hosts . 
  2 ) stop using your computer hardware . 
  it 's almost certain that you 're using either a mac or a pc . 
  both are american . 
  mac computers are created by apple , an american company . 
  pcs are created by many international companies , but the architecture is american ( ibm originally ) . 
  intel , amd , nvidia etc. . . american companies all . 
  3 ) never use a major operating system again . 
  the most common computer operating systems are windows and mac os , both american . 
  one made by microsoft , an american company , and one made by apple , again , an american company .
