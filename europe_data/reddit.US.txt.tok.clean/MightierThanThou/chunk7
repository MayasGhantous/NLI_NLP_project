  maybe you can just use a mobile device ... nope . 
  android is developed by google , an american company , and ios is developed by apple . 
  [ 8 of the top 14 it companies in the world are american ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_information_technology_companies ) . 
  the rest are asian . 
  none are european . 
  [ 7 of the top 10 software companies are american ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_software_companies ) . 
  2 are european . 
  if you want to act tough and call for sanctions against the us , try to implement this in your daily life . 
  you would n't last a week . 
  if you respond to my comment or ever participate on reddit again , that means that you ca n't function without american technology . 
  i was joking . 
  do you have any idea how pathetic you look right now ? 
  you could n't hang when actually facts came out so now you 're just throwing your shit around like a disgruntled monkey whose little monkey comfort zone has been compromised . 
  `` i do n't understand this !, 
  that makes me mad !, 
  i 'll just start talking shit about the person who disproved what i said !, 
  that way i win ! '', 
  you : `` americans suck , here 's my false view of things to validate that view i have ! '', 
  [ insert ignorant , uneducated bullshit ] me : `` you 're wrong '' [ insert facts ] you : `` haha you fucking stupid nationalist american ! '', 
  your conduct in this argument is a perfect example of how anti-americanism appeals to some of the most pathetic , intellectually crippled people on the planet . 
  you act like a 12 year old . 
  how can you have any confidence in your political beliefs when you said something you thought was true , got thoroughly repudiated with facts , and then you just start talking shit about your opponent . 
  do you talk about fucking people 's moms on xbox live . 
  that kind of thing seems like right up your alley . 
  you 're the type of person who refuses to abandon their delusions . 
  facts : * the us invented the modern computer that forms the basis of all computers we use today . 
  * the world wide web is not as important an invention as you think . 
  * the internet is the more important invention , and is purely an american invention , that the web itself relies on . 
  you could n't deal with opposing views that disprove your beliefs so you responded in the most pathetic way imaginable . 
  notice how you did n't respond to the content of what i said , you 're just relying on the `` lol dumb patriotic american '' thing ? 
  do you have any of your own thoughts or do you just act out your programming ? 
  you said something that was stupid , i corrected you , and then you 're acting like what i did was highly inappropriate somehow and you start throwing empty words and slurs around . 
  you responded in the most pathetic and anti-intellectual way you possibly could have responded . 
  it 's weird you say that considering all of the allies , including the soviets , were losing pretty much across the board before the us entered the conflict . 
  the us provide all of the allies with the majority of their material , that includes the soviets , who were absolutely , utterly dependent on us war aid , most notably food , fuel , steel , and vehicles for logistics and transportation . 
  without the hundreds of thousands of reliable cargo trucks the us provided , the soviets would have had little ability to mobilize westerward . 
  the us did the most to open the second front in europe as well , which relieved pressure from the soviets on the eastern front . 
  about a third of german divisions were moved from the eastern europe to western europe to respond to the allied invasion in france , which the us led and contributed to the most . 
  and not strictly relevant but important to note , the us did this while fighting another regional war on the other side of the globe at the same time , with very little help . 
  the us did the most in n. africa , the med , italy , and western europe while also doing by far the most in the asia-pacific region against japan . 
  the us gave more help to the allies than the allies gave to the us , by far . 
   cherry picking one defeat in a 6 year war are we ? 
  um , it 's pretty important in the context of d-day to point out that without the us holding your hand , you guys got absolutely stomped in ground warfare against germany and retreated from mainland europe at dunkirk . 
  a liberation of western europe would not have been possible without the us . 
  after you got stomped at dunkirk , you later tried to regain a toehold in mainland europe in the disaster euphemistically called , after the fact , as the dieppe `` raid '' . 
  your country did n't win a single important offensive against the axis until after the us took over supreme allied command and began composing the majority of allied troops in n. africa , the med , italy , and western europe . 
  you were getting stomped . 
  the liberation of western europe was right in your backyard and yet the us commanded your forces , and the us had several times more forces involved than you did . 
  in the rare event that your commanders were allowed to lead joint operations , they were failures , yet again , like operation market garden . 
  it 's incredible how incapable you brits are of looking at wwii critically . 
  you 're desperate to salvage your pride , despite how terribly you performed in the war , and how dependent you were on americans to rescue you . 
  1 ) the us took omaha beach with 43,250 men ( in 2 divisions ) , utah beach with 32,000 men ( in 1 division ) , and point du hoc cliffs with 225 special forces . 
  all together contributing more than 75,000 men on d-day coastal landings , which was about 3 divisions . 
  [ this does n't include 2 airborne divisions and the western glider taskforce that landed slightly inland from utah beach either . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/allied_invasion_force.jpg ) so about 5 divisions all together were contributed by the us ( the taskforce was small ) . 
  also , the us fought against the most formidable defense , as you should know , which was at omaha . 
  so the us fought with the most troops , against the most and best troops the germans had defending the beaches . 
  the british took gold beach with 24,970 men ( in 1 division ) , and sword beach with 28,845 men ( in 1 division ) . 
  thats a total of about 53,000 landing forces . 
  this is in addition to the eastern task force gliders . 
  so that is still only 2 divisions . 
  the canadians took juno beach , the least-defended beach , with 15,000 men . 
  britain and canada contributed less troops and had less landing points . 
  the us deployed 5 divisions on d-day , britain and canada together only deployed 3 . 
  the us had 6 landing points ( if you include pointe du hoc ) , the british and canadians together only had 4 . 
  the us had 75,000 men on d-day , canada and the uk combined only had 68,000 . 
  not only did the us have more men involved , it also fought against more german divisions who were in better shape than the occupational division made up of conscripts from eastern europe that defended the british and canadian beaches . 
  2 ) d-day was n't the entirety of the battle of normandy or the whole liberation of france . 
  a lot more troops came ashore after the d-day beaches were taken . 
  the us not only had command of these operations , but had the most troops . 
  [ the us had 19 divisions in normandy ] ( http://www.army.mil/d-day/divisions.html ) in total . 
  look at [ this map of army deployments in western europe ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/38/21/79/38217913036737b70c2e0acb731b51e8.jpg ) hodges , 1st army ( usa ) patton , 3rd army ( usa ) devers , 6th army ( usa ) patch , 7th army ( usa ) simpson , 9th army ( usa ) bradley , 12th army ( usa ) gerow 15th army ( usa ) dempsey , 2nd army ( uk ) montgomery , 21st army ( uk ) crerar , 1st army ( canada ) de lattre , 1st army ( france ), 
  the web is just code that is transmitted via the internet . 
  all the web does is dictate how data is organized and displayed visually in an interface . 
  it 's the lesser invention . 
  tim berners-lee just took hypertext that was invented by an american and this was chosen by the us as the standard for the purpose of outreach with europe . 
  none of that would be possible without the internet , which was is the underlying technology that transmits data , and was invented by the us when tim berners-lee was a teenager , long before he started his work . 
  vinton cerf and robert kahn ( americans ) invented the internet . 
  they are in engineers / scientists . 
  tim berners-lee is just a code monkey . 
  there are literally thousands of software programs that are more complex than the web . 
  the average mobile app today is a more momentous and impressive technical achievement than the web . 
   it 's for far better reasons than an internet you could n't use without the european inventions of both the computer and www this is typical ignorant european shit you 're doing , you 're determined to avoid giving the us credit that you have to rewrite and distort history to rob the us of credit for its contributions . 
  pathetic . 
  the first digital , programmable computer that forms the basis of modern computing was the [ eniac ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eniac ) , which was invented in the us . 
  basically all personal computers today use american-designed computing architecture and american components . 
  intel and amd are both american , and they nearly completely dominate the microchip market . 
  the [ microprocessor ] ( http://inventors.about.com/od/mstartinventions/a/microprocessor.htm ) , the [ hard drive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_hard_disk_drives#1950s.e2.80.931970s ) , the [ graphics card ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geforce_256 ) , and [ ram ] ( http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa100898.htm ) are all forms of computer components that pcs use that were invented in the us . 
  the internet is the [ internet protocol suite ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_protocol_suite ) , aka the tcp/ip protocol , invented by [ robert kahn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bob_kahn ) and [ vinton cerf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vinton_g._cerf ) , two americans working for the us military . 
  it 's the technology that actually transmits data . 
  it is the internet . 
  originally it was a us military network called [ arpanet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arpanet ) , when it was expanded to civilian and global use , it became the internet . 
  the web came later . 
  the web is a system of code that is transmitted via the internet , that only serves to compile data and then display it in a visual interface in a browser . 
  tim berners-lee took existing hypertext code ( [ invented by an american ] ( http://www.livinginternet.com/w/wi_nelson.htm ) ) and just created the first monolithic system of hypertext that became standard . 
  the internet is the more crucial technology . 
  the internet can function without the web , the web can not function without the internet . 
  giving credit to the europeans for the internet would be like taking credit for designing a car when all you did was paint the exterior . 
  rather , that through an intense battle the british could n't take down the us flag . 
  the us national anthem is about a formative battle in early us history , symbolizing the efforts of the country .
