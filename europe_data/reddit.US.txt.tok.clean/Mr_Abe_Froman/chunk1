  let me give it a shot : lyshchtyzshyiaeehuihaanyo \u013e = `` ly '' as in the l in the name `` lia/leah '' maybe `` lieu '' too , this one is weird . 
  \u0161 = `` sh '' as in `` shut it '' \u010d = `` ch '' as in `` chav '' \u0165 = `` ty '' as in the words `` bet you '' ( wikipedia helped me here ) \u017e = `` zh '' like the s in `` asia '' \u00fd = kind of an `` ee '' sound \u00e1 = `` ah '' as in `` ah , so that 's how you say that '' \u00ed = a more deliberate `` ee '' sound than \u00fd ( wiki says `` fr * ee * '' ) \u00e9 = `` eh '' as in `` l ** e ** t 's get on with it '' \u00fa = `` oo '' as in `` booooo , these are terrible '' \u00e4 = `` eh '' as in `` bed '' \u0148 = `` ni '' as in `` o ** ni ** on '' \u00f4 = like `` u '' and `` o '' together edit : format , at least it 's not czech and that ridiculous \u0159,

  that 's not a picture of iowa at all !, 
  i speak english as a first language . 
  i hate that sentence . 
  bison is the technical word . 
  `` buffalo bison buffalo bison buffalo buffalo buffalo bison '' makes much more sense . 
  after learning slovak , polish is very similar . 
  it is similar to spanish and portuguese . 
  the film is set outside of bratislava , hostel was filmed in the czech republic . 
  hej , i sometimes get confused on wikipedia because `` slovak '' in slovak is '' * sloven\u010dina * '' while `` slovene '' in slovene is '' * sloven\u0161\u010dina * '' i did n't know about the croatian/serbian thing though . 
  that is really confusing ( moreso than czech , slovak , slovene , or english problems ) !, 
  i know i do n't post here often , but here it goes ( i know my flag is slovak , i am american , i lived there long enough to miss it ) : * saint lucia * helan g\u00e5r * akvavit / vodka * hockey and eurovision * carl xvi gustaf and his apparent love of [ handball ] ( http://footballthoughtsfromsweden.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/silviaochcalle.jpg ) * saab , ikea * fish , flat bread , lingonberry , crayfish parties . 
  * random phrases from my grandparents hosting swedish exchange students and my mother and aunts studying there ( `` borta bra men hemma bast '' is one that hangs on a sign in my grandparents ' house ) * also those riots , not much in the american media , trying to find out more . 
  living near chicago helped me practice polish at my part-time job with customers who were polish . 
  at my university , the hockey players salute the crowd after the games . 
  it is more of a single-file waving their sticks in each direction , but still appreciated by the fans . 
  ( point being , crowd salutes are common in sports ) though waving with your arm slightly to the side , to salute everyone , is more appropriate and acceptable . 
  [ caesar augustus looks pretty cool doing it ] ( http://projectionsystems.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/roman_augustus21.jpg ), 
  as a response to number 1 , the bellamy salute was the official salute during the american pledge of allegiance [ source ] ( http://www.ushistory.org/documents/pledge.htm ) . 
  it was modified during wwii for being too similar to a nazi salute . 
  the author of the pledge described the proper salute in 1892 , so one can assume it was in wide use then . 
  as for number 2 , i agree . 
  there is even a simple solution . 
  if you want to salute your fans , raise your arm higher or bend your elbow ( turning it into a wave ) . 
  i have to go to a local coffee shop if i have any hope of getting a proper caff\u00e8 macchiato . 
  i usually order espresso because it is much harder to mess up . 
  they do n't call it * sexy * krumlov for nothing !, 
  or is it just my crazy friends ...

  * slovenskocesko * is the new trend . 
  after years of czechoslovakia , it 's nice to let slovaks go first . 
  `` mom , i hate you !, 
  why do n't you just go and abdicate already ! '', 
  they said `` they were not roma , they were gypsies '' . 
  but the result said they are interchangeable . 
  i guess `` gypsy '' could be used as a smaller , criminal group within roma but that would make them romani gypsies . 
  i guess i am just confused how they could be gypsies and not roma ( unless we are using `` gypsy '' as a blanket term for traveling theves and not an ethnic group ) edit : re-reading the article , they never mention roma or romani , so i guess the `` theif '' synonym works best . 
   in the age of google there is no excuse . 
  admittedly , google is of little help . 
  please point out what 's wrong . 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people . 
  this is the first result for roma , via disambiguation . 
  i always heard roma/romani and gypsy were interchangeable . 
  and before you say anything about wikipedia not being a real resource , i also looked [ on a language forum ] ( http://forum.wordreference.com/threads/gipsy-vs-romany-vs-traveller-gypsy.2010508/ ) with no help . 
  i mean no offense , it is just that google provides very little help and i 'd like to correct any mistakes i have been making .

   `` elektronik supersonik '' was supposed to be molvania 's entry into ** the 2004 eurovision song contest ** which took place in istanbul . 
  however , vladcik was arrested at istanbul atat\u00fcrk airport and immediately deported for `` recreational drug '' usage . 
  upon his return , vladcik apologised to everyone in molvania for letting them down , especially his family , his friends and his dealer . 
  [ wiki for zladko vladcik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santo_cilauro#zladko_vladcik ), 
  you have n't heard of molvania ? 
  that means i get to tell you about zlad !,

  according to the world carrot museum :  the long orange dutch cultivar , is commonly held to be the progenitor of the orange horn carrot varieties . 
  although there is no proof to support the tale that orange carrots were grown to honor william of orange , the ditch * did * breed the first orange carrots .

  i was studying in slovakia at the time . 
  it was just a growing sense of disbelief and excitement through the entire game . 
  i guess i was n't paying as close attention . 
  i meant the royal house of orange - nassau , but okay . 
  i guess netherlands is just more obvious since `` orange '' is right in the name . 
  both slovenia * and slovakia * are in fifa . 
  slovakia ~ ~ usually ~ ~ * sometimes * makes it to the first round of the world cup . 
  they even won a game against italy in 2010 ( somehow ) . 
  edit : because i was wrong . 
  i guess people were n't paying attention in 2010 when slovakia beat italy in the world cup first round . 
  that was a weird game . 
  at least `` orange '' is the royal family 's color , what 's italy 's reason ? 
  edit : it looks like both are the royal families ' . 
  fine , you got me .
