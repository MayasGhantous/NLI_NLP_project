  and the united states is increasingly less willing to let europe lean on us . 
  we already decided to start shifting our policy towards asia years ago and this whole situation has only served to emphasize that it 's in our national interests to distance ourselves from europe and toward asia . 
  europe could find itself without friends soon . 
  blaming the us for the ineptitude and internal squabbling of the eu is beyond absurd . 
  please by all means ignore my point and focus on my hyperbole . 
  of course but the spread of christendom has definitely been used as a justification for colonialism and the slave trade . 
  what i 'm saying is is this is the pot calling the kettle black and the pot feels superior because at least it was n't a hypocrite although it did it 's atrocities in a time when it was socially acceptable . 
  completely ignoring all the justifications that were given for colonialism including spreading christianity ... 
  personally it 's convinced me of the need for the united states to commit more to our shift to the east and away from europe . 
  think what you want i honestly do n't give a fuck . 
  publicly taking sanctions off the table at the beginning of the crisis . 
  military action was always off the table and now by taking economic action off as well that leaves only diplomatic pressure which to an oligarch like putin is meaningless . 
  further , there 's been no united front whatsoever . 
  petty internal squabbling has prevented the eu from being a global player on the scale of russia , us or china . 
  basically they ca n't stop fighting each other long enough to deal with an outside issue and when faced with that issue they turned and ran ( in my opinion anyway ) . 
  i pretty clearly said that for american presidents american interests come before global ones . 
  i could n't agree with you more . 
  i do n't understand why so many people here are outraged by this though . 
  as if the united states should put eu interests above our own ... 
  i 've been slammed pretty hard here for having those opinions . 
  i 'd love to maintain close ties to europe but they ca n't seem to stop squabbling amongst themselves for two minutes and they 've proven themselves unwilling and unable to deal with outside threats alone . 
  so are we now being held to different standards than other countries ? 
  literally every european nation has their own skeletons in the closet of imperialism . 
  unless you were just pointing out that for american presidents american interests come before global interests . 
  which i 'd agree with . 
  are you saying they should be more involved ? 
  i 'd agree with that but they removed themselves from the negotiations by their own actions and words . 
  eu really dropped the ball on this one . 
  you honestly think after over a decade of war we give a flying fuck about ukraine ? 
  we 're more interested in nfl free agency and march madness brackets at the moment . 
  no we did not `` promise to protect ukraine '' . 
  the treaty you 're talking about very clearly states that in exchange for disarmament the us , uk and russia will respect ukraine 's borders , give them economic aid if they are coerced economically by a nuclear power and bring any act of aggression towards ukraine by a nuclear power before the un . 
  it literally says nothing of military aid or intervention on the behalf of ukraine . 
  yes i could have worded them better . 
  but it 's extremely frustrating when your country has been at war since you were a child and you 're now in your early 20s and you 've watched older friends and relatives march off to some place you 've never heard of and then not come back and for what ? 
  and then the same people who were talking about how america is nothing but bad and war for a decade are now saying that we should come halfway around the world to defend people who are capable of defending themselves while those people do fuck all . 
  it 's not just this guys comments . 
  when i say something along the lines of `` if russia invades europe , europe is going to have to fight with us '' and that 's controversial here that says a lot . 
  i see a lot of sentiment here that if russia pulls a stunt there 's an expectation that america will swoop in and europe can stay home . 
  i do n't think it 's unreasonable at all to say that if that guy wants u.s. forces in eastern europe that european forces should come as well . 
  do n't count on american support . 
  you guys can have france if you want . 
  we could leave our forces where they are . 
  gives us better geopolitical position and if the europeans are counting on us to save them from russia while they sit at home they 're sure as shit not going to do anything if we tell them we 're not leaving and to fuck off . 
  hell we should annex the areas around the bases for good measure . 
  120,000,000 fit for service and 145,000,000 available manpower according to http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=united-states-of-america, 
  well shit if they 're going to act like entitled pricks i 'm most def down with that . 
  threats ? 
  more like we 're fucking allies and if shit is about to go down on ** europe 's doorstep ** we 're certainly not going to be like `` no it 's cool you guys just chill and jack off while we go outside * your * house and fuck up this dude '' . 
  why in the * fuck * should we send our boys to go die to protect ** europe ** if ** europe ** is n't willing to do something ? 
  what about european forces ? 
  because you 're out of your mind if you think we 're going to let you lot sit this out if shit does kick off . 
  i * dare * the ruskies to make a move . 
  i do n't want war whatsoever considering i 'm a 21 year old male but i can guarantee you that if we went to war with russia there would be 100 million american men at enlistment stations tomorrow . 
  i believe i saw somewhere that we installed more solar panels last year than the past 40 years combined . 
  we also have the ability to do a lot more in regards to wind , solar , geothermal , etc. 
  we 're not doing great but we 're on the right path . 
  we 'll take it and bury it in our deserts . 
  for a reasonable fee of course , 
  why should n't we ? 
  europe has n't exactly stepped up to the plate either and gay rights are much more important to the average american than crimea is . 
  as we should . 
  our european friends have been so fond of claiming there are no threats to europe . 
  so we should turn our focus elsewhere . 
  since when is it impossible to be offended or outraged by something and yet not pursue legal action ? 
  i do n't think europe would be able to take on russia anyway . 
  it would end up with american boots on the ground and american blood protecting europe . 
  well should n't france and the uk have done the most lifting in mali/libya since they were the ones pushing for intervention ? 
  i do n't have any operations in mind , but as we 've seen with the crimea issue things come up that we should be prepared for and quite frankly i do n't think europe pulls it 's weight when it comes to nato . 
  we should n't have to spend the absurd amount we do on our military , plenty of nato does n't even spend the required 2 % . 
  i just really do n't want putin to be able to get away with taking crimea and not even having to pay a price for it . 
  that sets a terrible example and i think the eu and us have a moral obligation to help ukraine . 
  is n't the main reason for not wanting to go through with the sanctions because of the gas from russia ? 
  would it be possible for say the u.s. and canada to get gas to europe ? 
  from an outside perspective european nations need to integrate further through the eu . 
  the big european powers are still mighty in their own way but on a global stage the eu is capable of so much more than they 're doing currently . 
  that 's not really what i was trying to get at . 
  i kind of just meant in general the u.s. has to do the heavy lifting for joint military operations . 
  it would benefit both europe and the u.s. greatly if europe had more integrated and capable military capabilities . 
  i do n't know if i 'd go that far but there definitely needs to be pressure on the eu to step up their game militarily . 
  that would benefit both the eu and the u.s. 
  i do n't know how to word this without coming off like a prick but europe needs to pull more weight here . 
  this is happening on europe 's doorstep yet the u.s. is the one being expected to do all the heavy lifting . 
  if europe is n't willing or able to be a major world player i think the u.s. should keep on turning to the east . 
  so there are no sanctions or anything coming from europe ? 
  i do n't understand why we do n't roll out sanctions if we 're only doing 27 billion in trade with russia . 
  that 's a drop in the bucket for our economy as a whole . 
  those new solar arrays in the mojave are pretty badass though and where i live in the midwest they 're throwing up wind turbines as fast as they can . 
  there 's one wind farm only a few hundred miles from where i live and the farm lasts 11 miles and the turbines stretch as far as you can see . 
  pretty impressive and gives me some hope for green energy in the u.s. 
  take it up with the belgians , they 're the ones who own anheuser-busch . 
  do people use that stuff for anything other than grilled cheese ? 
  perhaps , but at least we have n't come out and actively * opposed * sanctions . 
  this is a european issue and if the europeans are n't willing to have some balls the united states should . 
  i 'd say it 's incredibly likely kerry is just saying bullshit but at least he 's * there * . 
  if we end up backing off now who can blame us after the eu ran for the hills especially considering this is happening on * their * doorstep not ours . 
  so uh , are we now expected to go ahead with our sanctions that are going to hurt our economy anyway ? 
  our secretary of state is in kiev right now . 
  we 're giving ukraine a billion dollars . 
  what the actual fuck guys ?
