  no way united states would n't be able to establish naval and air dominance . 
  i know we 're weary after iraq and afghanistan but if you want to see pissed off americans i dare putin to put himself in a position to go to war . 
  the whole rust belt would be alive like has n't been seen since the second world war . 
  russia would also have almost no capability to strike the u.s. unless it decides to go nuclear which would be suicide . 
  whereas the u.s. already has troops and planes in europe , mid east and asia . 
  and that 's just the u.s. 
  if * we 're * fighting russia over * ukraine * there 's no way in hell you lot are n't coming with . 
  geothermal as well , they 're building wells all over my university campus . 
  i 'd bet the u.s. and china are much more economically dependent on one another than russia and china are but i have no sources for that . 
  there 's also tens of thousands of chinese college students ( who come from rich families ) in the u.s. 
  no of course not . 
  more of the difference we have when it comes to ethnicity relations . 
  here in the u.s. there 's a lot more racial issues than ethnic issues . 
  we also do n't have big american populations living in our neighboring countries . 
  fun to look at our differences sometimes yet realize we 're all still human , 
  i could also see some naval action . 
  nothing says `` calm the fuck down '' like parking a u.s. aircraft carrier fleet off your coast . 
  if it makes you feel better eurobro , the u.s. is pretty good at being uncivilized when need be and we have your back , regardless of what the politicians do . 
  although seeing as i 'm the age of the first draft rounds if things did kick off i 'm hoping for peace . 
  what an interesting way of looking at it . 
  here in the states we just add immigrants to our population count without a second thought . 
  i know you 're just making a joke but i was nine years old when we invaded iraq . 
  i 'm 20 now . 
  it makes a bit of a difference . 
  thank you !, 
  i do n't like jackasses any more than elephants . 
  as somebody who has no idea what he 's looking at , can somebody please explain this to me ? 
  not that hard to throw money at that kind of shit when the working class has been getting fucked on healthcare , infrastructure , wages and education for decades . 
  yeah no offense to our ukraine bros but i want absolutely no fucking part of that . 
  there 's no guarantee that he has control over the military and with the dismissal of the head guy that could signal there 's a difference in opinion . 
  so why should the protestors take his deal and not keep pushing ? 
  the power dynamic certainly seems to be swinging in their favor . 
  what evidence is there that the army will get involved unless i missed something major ? 
  things are bad right now but i think if the opposition is successful it will greatly benefit the ukraine in the end . 
  i do n't think it 's at that point . 
  imo yes it often is justifiable , only the people of the ukraine can make that choice right now though . 
  as you * should * . 
  as far as i 'm concerned this is absolutely a russian/eu/ukraine issue not a u.s. one . 
  it 's much easier to say somebody should do something when that somebody is n't you . 
  when it 's not your friends and family going off to die in some place you 've never heard of for who knows what . 
  to be blunt that 's pretty damn easy to say when you 're not the one living in the country that would be shouldering the vast majority of the lifting in this theoretical scenario . 
  but what does russian involvement have to do with the u.s. ? 
  just because they choose to involve themselves does n't mean we do too . 
  why in the fuck would we , after * almost * being done with over a decade of war , be gung ho to charge into * ukraine * ? 
  how can anybody think it 's even a remote possibility ? 
  yes , the poor police always being brutalized and never doing anything wrong ... 
  quite frankly you have no idea what the fuck you 're talking about . 
  i do n't know , that 's why i said potential . 
  possibly , that 's the point . 
  there 's always bias in any sort of news article whatsoever ... 
   potential bias potential po \u00b7 ten \u00b7 tial p\u0259\u02c8tench\u0259l adjective 1 . having or showing the capacity to become or develop into something in the future . 
  no worries . 
  took an extra 10 seconds apiece to look up their info and it helps give a clearer picture of potential bias . 
  the pictures will most likely be biased coming from an american source but i do n't think our journalists are running around tearing apart hotels to make them look bad . 
  i certainly hope not or i clogged toliets across germany , switzerland and austria . 
  i never said that . 
  this is hands down the jerkiest circle jerk i 've ever seen in / r/europe . 
  watch the damn game ( because 99 % of you have obviously never seen 2 seconds of an american football game based off your comments ) before you decide you hate it . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/states%27_rights in short , our constitution mandates that all rights not explicitly given to the federal government belong to the states . 
  that 's not true whatsoever . 
  firstly , playbooks are known for being very large that players are expected to have * memorized * . 
  have you ever even watched a game or know what an audible is ? 
  players most certainly do react to the formations of the opponent and react accordingly ( changing the play , etc. ), 
  without * any * coach or coordinator input . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh5gwhhjz7q ) video is a good look at how peyton manning does it , widely considered the best ever at reading opposing defenses . 
  every word that he 's shouting means something to one of his teammates on the field . 
  he could be changing the blocking scheme , audibling to a totally different play , adjusting receiver routes , etc. 
  he also has to throw in `` fake '' audibles as well so the defense ca n't pick up on what they 'll do . 
  so you have to be able to make those decisions before the playclock runs out and you get a penalty and then communicate those decisions to your teammates while 80,000 + people are screaming at you and massive men on the other side of the line are waiting to rip your head off . 
  tl ; dr : you have absolutely no clue what you 're talking about . 
  it 's literally chess with 6 ' 8 '' 350 lbs behemoths that crush each others skulls . 
  what 's not to love !, 
  late to the party but i 'll try to explain . 
  the super bowl is hands down * the * most watched live event in america every year . 
  well over 100 million americans tune in . 
  companies will literally start working on these commercials a year in advance , most run only once during the super bowl and it 's very expensive to get an ad spot ( $ 4 million for 30 seconds ) . 
  the commercials tend to be `` better '' than the other crap that we get year round . 
  there 's also a ton of people watching who do n't understand the game that well but they can get a commercial . 
  there 's a phrase in the u.s. `` to fry an egg on the sidewalk '' . 
  not only that but what possible interest does the u.s. have in ukraine ? 
  russia would never allow them to buddy up with us and they 're economically weak . 
  it 's just not worth the risk of ww3 like you said . 
  i honestly have n't seen a single peep about ukraine on our news . 
  personally i think that 's a bit short-sighted . 
  it would be a lot of work and aid for sure but long term having ukraine in the eu could be the push it needs to truly rival or even exceed the u.s. china and russia as world players . 
  part of their job is also dispersing the protest and maintaining civil order . 
  if you can paint the protesters in a negative light and make the discussion about violence rather than the real issue you 've won . 
  ruskies know what 's up . 
  pure land and stick size is n't the game anymore , it 's power projection and most importantly what role you play in the world economy . 
  it 's okay to exploit the poor so long as they are n't jewish . 
  white girl uniform ? 
  it 's more often about power and intimidation than sexual pleasure . 
  source : i and several friends have spent time inside . 
  why is she wearing cowboy boots ? 
  especially cars , they manage to drop the phrase ** german engineering ** at least 10 times in a 30 second ad . 
  [ you 're giving me a freedom boner ] ( http://onemansblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/us_military_formation.jpg ), 
  yeah but ** cinnamon ** ? 
  come on . 
  i 'm not trying to justify it . 
  i 'm just playing devils advocate .
