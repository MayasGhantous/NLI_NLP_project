  his english accent also sounded incredibly forced . 
  i think he 's a brit . 
  same here . 
  it also sounds suspiciously like what a brit pretending to be american sounds like . 
  it would also make sense for a brit to impersonate a west coaster because that 's what 's on tv . 
  my money is on british . 
  as a midwesterner that does n't sound anything like anyone i 've ever actually talked to . 
  i 've only heard an accent like that on tv and his still sounded forced . 
  actually to me his american accent sounded very forced and unnatural . 
  if anything it sounded almost exactly like it does when a brit tries to pull off an american accent so i 'd agree with your guess of british . 
  i agree , it sounded exactly like a british person mimicking an american accent . 
  i feel like something important has been missed . 
  if you read to the end of the article they say people have pointed out that the `` flag '' is actually a rain poncho . 
  i was joking , 
  you mean to tell me that french fries and french toast are n't really french ? 
  thank you for the explanation . 
  if all you say is true i may indeed have to buy some cheese . 
  is it good cheese ? 
   jon stewart knows how to twist the knife . 
  `` so you guys are all upset we 're spying on you , '' america 's most popular tv satirist told an imaginary european audience . 
  `` but i just have one question : have you met us ? 
  meddling in your affairs for our national self-interest is kind of our thing . '', 
  the idea there is that stewart is essentially saying nobody should be surprised . 
  he 's saying that the u.s. has a history of meddling in foreign affairs to protect self interests . 
  that 's not a defense of the nsa surveillance at all . 
  the next people mr. pitzke talks about are all connected to the government and the nsa and naturally they defend the program . 
  mike rogers ( chairman of the house intelligence committee ) , peter king ( chairman of the house subcommittee on counter-terrorism and intelligence ) , keith alexander ( outgoing nsa chief ) . 
  so , forgive me if i 'm not shocked by the fact that they 're defending a program that gives them power and their jobs . 
  then , he talks about an editorial in the new york times by stewart baker where he said `` allies are n't always friends . 
  that 's just life and international politics . 
  as german chancellor angela merkel too knows quite well . '', 
  is that really that unfair of a statement to make ? 
  were the western allies and the ussr `` friends '' during the second world war ? 
  anyway , baker worked for the department of homeland security under bush so he 's not exactly neutral either . 
  then we get to senator jeanne shaheen who said the nsa programs had caused `` significant damage '' to relations with allies and that americans have `` repair work to do . '' . 
  she also said `` and i think we have hard questions we need to ask of the nsa about what 's really going on in this program , '' . 
  shaheen is the senior senator from new hampshire and was also the first woman in u.s. history to be elected both as a governor and a senator . 
  she was also considered for vice-president by gore back when he ran . 
  despite all this , her voice is `` drowned out '' according to the author . 
  if only she had a more impressive resume maybe people would take her more seriously . 
  this is a pretty shitty article . 
  plenty of dramatization and sensationalism . 
  i particularly enjoy the headline : ** u.s. ** on spying scandal : `` allies are n't always friends '' . 
  really ? 
  the u.s. said that ? 
  it 's funny because that 's the exact quote from stewart baker 's editorial ( remember him ? ) . 
  i was n't aware mr. baker spoke for the entire country and all 300 million + people that live inside it . 
  no mention of the uproar by average americans ? 
  you did n't forget that our own government is spying on us too did you ? 
  it would be much easier to take down the nsa and government surveillance in general if the ordinary people around the world work together instead of setting ourselves apart from each other . 
  then again , that 's not as catchy of a headline as ' ** u.s. ** on spying scandal : `` allies are n't always friends '' . ', 
  that 's not the only issue though . 
  would the american government be more likely to go after snowden if he were in germany or russia ? 
  i have to think they 'd be much more cautious about trying something in russia . 
  can somebody explain this to me a bit better ? 
  all i 'm getting from the site is that their cheese is banned in russia so me buying their cheese is somehow supporting democracy and freedom ? 
  no offense , but why should i care if your cheese is banned in russia ? 
  you say that me buying it ( in the u.s. ) is supporting human rights and democracy . 
  how do you figure ? 
  can you explain your reasoning there ? 
  i do n't see how me buying your cheese in the u.s. will affect russian attitudes towards importing lithuanian cheese . 
  can you explain why my cheese purchase will sway the russians ? 
  do n't forget that i 'm not sold on lithuanian cheese being available in russia is a lack of democracy or a human rights issue . 
  any help here ? 
  do n't give up . 
  you are not alone . 
  i think things go deeper than that . 
  the politics of urban areas and rural ( and to a lesser extent suburban areas ) ones are so far apart that they can not be reconciled . 
  it 's not just the system that 's to blame . 
  that being said i entirely agree with you that the system itself is flawed and must not ( and i believe can not ) survive for very long in the 21st century . 
  there are some deep divisions in this country and i just ca n't see any way to reconcile the left with the right . 
  but you never explained * why * , 
  from wikipedia :  anglosphere is a neologism which refers to a set of english speaking nations with a similar cultural heritage , based upon populations originating from the nations of the british isles : england , wales , scotland , and ireland , and which today maintain close political and military cooperation . 
  while the nations included in different sources vary , the term anglosphere usually does not include all countries where english is an official language , although commonly included nations were all once part of the british empire . 
  in its most restricted sense , the term covers the united kingdom , ireland , united states , canada , australia and new zealand , which post-british empire maintain a close affinity of cultural , familial and political links with one another . 
  helpful map [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/anglospeak%28800px%29.png ) . 
  while many of the countries you listed are on this map , they either do n't have a majority of native english speakers or are not considered culturally close enough to be considered on the same level of the anglosphere as the united kingdom , ireland , united states , canada , australia and new zealand . 
  although naturally there are conflicting definitions of the anglosphere . 
  the one i mentioned being the most accepted . 
   which are less burdened by rules that attempt to preserve individual jobs at the expense of employment as a whole . 
  source ? 
  an example perhaps ? 
  otherwise this is just coming off as a typical trick by the right arguing that the protection of workers and workers rights is partially responsible for the economic downturn . 
  i 'd actually argue that workers have had * fewer * rights as the years have gone on and that 's hurt our economy far more than any `` over-regulation '' . 
  iirc the real purchasing power of a working class american salary has done nothing but decrease since the 1970s . 
  meanwhile the wealthy have seen exponential growth of their earnings and holdings and are richer than ever . 
   the first reaction for those of us who live in the united states should be to pause a moment and be thankful . 
  i honestly do n't think i 've ever heard a bigger load of horseshit . 
  be thankful ? 
  what the fuck for ? 
  thankful for the `` free market '' that ensures the poor stay poor ? 
  that we have to work two or three fucking jobs just to put food on the table ? 
  if you can even find a fucking job since there 's such a mass of unemployed employers can pretty much hire whoever they want and pay them whatever they want . 
  that we ca n't see a doctor when we 're sick ? 
  that a trip to the hospital is the reason for ** 50 % ** of family bankruptcies in the us ? 
  thankful for a government that spies on us and our friends around the world ? 
  thankful for a government that sends our sons to die all over the world and for what ? 
  so they can bomb the shit out of the people who live there to ensure the steady flow of oil . 
  bonus money for all the contractors that get to come in after and rebuild everything . 
  oh yeah , now you can put a mcdonalds on every corner too .
