  lucky bastards . 
  not unless it was really great service . 
  where i 'm from standard is 15 % , 10 % for subpar ( or nothing ) . 
  restaurant workers in the us are also legally paid something like $ 2.50 / 3 an hour . 
  the tips are what gives them their income . 
  lots of people like this because the make good tips but it 'll vary by restaurant and by location . 
  i 've known plenty of restaurant workers just making it even with tips . 
  the objective of `` cheering '' and your role as a fan in american football is very different . 
  as a home stadium you 're expected to create as much noise as possible to make it difficult for opposing offenses to communicate their playcalls and audibles on the field . 
  the objective is a sheer wall of white noise forcing quarterbacks to yell very close up to their teammates , wasting valuable seconds of the playclock potentially leading to a delay of game penalty or a false start .

  do n't take this the wrong way but the metro area i live in has a higher population than the entire country . 
  most people i grew up with will live and die in the county they were born in and probably never have a passport or meet somebody from the czech republic . 
  why would they care ? 
  pro tip : do n't remind people in `` flyover '' states that they live in `` flyover '' states . 
  they fucking hate that . 
  source : born and raised in a `` flyover '' state . 
  people are giving you lots of answers but realistically it probably has more to do with a relatively low poverty rate ( 13th , 11.1 % ) , unemployment ( 5th , 4.1 % ) and 7th in hdi ( 5.69 ) . 
  the weather and low population density ( outside the twin cities anyway ) may have something to do with disease . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_texan in 1990 about 3 million texans considered themselves to have at least some german ancestry . 
  ca n't find any more recent stats . 
  there are still about 3,000 native texas german speakers as well . 
  yep , here in the states we have things like [ bottlegate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5e3bw_ylsy ) , [ disco demolition night ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1cp1751wja ) and raider fans . 
  really it just seems like human beings + sports = idiot fans . 
  i was comparing the situations not the specifics . 
  they 're still poor people trying to migrate somewhere with better prospects . 
  but thanks for telling me four times . 
  deciding how it 's spent = / = having an opinion . 
  and i do n't disagree with that but there 's a difference between valid criticism of these industries and full blown hysteria `` shut it all down '' that 's been shoved in my mouth by numerous people throughout this thread . 
  i never once say that . 
  west virginians can do whatever they want with state and local taxes . 
  does n't mean the rest of the country is n't entitled to an opinion when it 's federal tax money . 
  red states across the board dislike government , does n't change the fact that red states average more money taken in from the federal govt . 
  than paid in taxes . 
  not at all , i 'm suggesting actual investment in that region of the country regardless of how it affects coal production . 
  i never once suggest shutting down mines . 
  people have continually put words into my mouth throughout this thread . 
  the fact is that those areas of the country have been chronically underfunded across the board in every single area not related to coal production for decades . 
  appalachia has some of the worst education and poverty rates in the country . 
  of course people do n't want the coal industry to leave , once they do they 're fucked and they know it . 
  people want to keep their livelihoods ? 
  you do n't say !, 
  does n't mean the company gives a fuck about their workers or investing in the community , that there are n't serious environmental impacts and that coal is going to run out whether people want it to or not . 
  these companies and industries have consistently shown for decades if not centuries that they do n't give one lick about the environmental and human impacts of their actions , do you seriously think they 're suddenly going to have a change of heart once resources become more scarce ? 
  there 's pretty clear evidence that coal runoff contaminates wells and water tables . 
  i 'm not sure why everyone is jumping down my throat about fracking as i never even mentioned it in my original comment and in the follow up i specifically mention coal dust not fracking . 
  even if fracking does nothing to water supplies that does n't mean all the other things i mentioned do n't matter . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_subsidies#united_states $ 369 billion for oil , $ 121 billion for natural gas and $ 104 billion for coal from 1950-2010 . 
  compared to $ 74 billion for all non hydro renewable . 
  and many critics say these numbers are far lower than the actual . 
  the three largest renewable fuel subsidies were : alcohol credit for fuel excise tax ( $ 11.6 billion ) renewable electricity production credit ( $ 5.2 billion ) corn-based ethanol ( $ 5.0 billion ), 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/09/opinion/appalachia-turns-on-itself.html?_r=1&amp; 50 % higher rates of fatal cancer and 42 % higher rates of birth defects in areas with mtr mining . 
  furthermore rates of black lung disease have risen in the past decade . 
  http://www2.epa.gov/hfstudy/published-scientific-papers most come to the conclusion that fracking has serious potential impacts on water tables and that the current epa contaminant standards are too high for effective regulatory practice . 
  but the fact is that study of this takes much longer than it does to actually frack and do you think they 're waiting on the science to go ahead and make money ? 
  fuck no . 
  yes because shale oil , tar sands and such are all perfectly environmentally friendly ... 
  i wo n't argue with the better tech aspect but there will come a time when it 's more expensive to extract those materials than they 're worth . 
  so what is your suggestion , just enjoy the ride until the show is over ? 
  how does that contradict what i said about industry packing up and leaving those towns to die ? 
  if i 'm a hysteric you 're an apologist . 
  there are plenty of environmentally friendly options and we should be working to advance those technologies to the point where they 're competitive with fossil fuels . 
  they 're certainly not there yet but i 'd much rather get a head start than wait until the hydrocarbons are all gone and the seas have taken away much of our coastal areas and forced migration of millions if not billions of people . 
  that will ultimately be a far bigger problem than the current issues with fossil fuels vs. wind/solar/etc . 
  we should be subsidizing those industries , not throwing billions at the richest companies on the planet . 
  what part of it is factually incorrect ? 
  you can google pictures of mountaintop removal . 
  you can google pictures of people 's drinking water coming up filled with coal dust . 
  you can youtube videos of people lighting the natural gas coming out of their faucet . 
  you can look up the wiki article on black lung . 
  you can drive through abandoned industrial towns all throughout the rust belt . 
  how in the fuck am i being hysterical ? 
  i gave pretty specific examples of well documented issues . 
  i 'm not being hysteric i 'm criticizing . 
  edit : 50 % higher rates of fatal cancer and 42 % higher rates of birth defects than in general population in areas with mtr mining as found by ** 21 ** peer reviewed studies . 
  do n't forget completely destroying the environment and people 's lives not to mention their drinking water . 
  the industrialists and capitalists have had no problem leveling mountains throughout appalachia to get at coal and i doubt they 'll have any qualms doing similar to get at oil/gas . 
  then once they ca n't extract any more wealth from the earth they move on leaving the towns and villages that have relied solely on providing labor for those industries for over a century to wither and die . 
  google pictures of [ coal mountain top removal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mountaintop_removal_mining ) , they 're literally tearing down mountains to get at that black gold . 
  and they do n't give a fuck if there 's natural gas shooting out of your water faucet or if the water comes out black/red or if their workers end up dying of black lung . 
  the same reason the us has so many illegal immigrants . 
  they can work under the table getting paid less than the law allows and not paying taxes . 
  at least that 's how most of the mexican illegals i 've worked with did it . 
  source : years working manual labor side by side with illegal immigrants . 
  the poverty rates are a bit higher and education rates a bit lower in oklahoma . 
  i think it 's more cultural though . 
  midwesterners iirc are only behind the south and not by much in gun ownership rates but in my experience southerners like to play cowboy and they 're the ones you see online waltzing through walmart with their ar-15 . 
  not saying it does n't happen here but it 's more likely to be like guns stay in the home unless going to the range or it 's deer season . 
  concealed carry has exploded in the past few years though . 
  that ai n't saying anything . 
  people do n't kill people in iowa because people do n't see people in iowa . 
  the population density in iowa is 21.4 / sq. 
  km compared to 364.85 / sq. 
  km for belgium . 
  source : i 'm from the midwest . 
  the list of who has n't done that is shorter than who has . 
  you act like there is no opportunity cost to learning . 
  if i need to work 3 jobs just to keep a roof over my head i do n't give a fuck about looking things up on wikipedia .
