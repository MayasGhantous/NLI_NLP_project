  takes the emergency services about 30 minutes to get there . 
  nearest town is about a 45 minute drive away . 
  so , for most people it 's kind of a `` why the fuck would you want to live out there '' . 
  so the land has to be cheap since there is n't a very high demand for it ( unless it 's located in a resource rich area ) . 
  * edit * : actually , 110,000 euros is probably right around the cheaper side of a suburban house in the u.s. around here houses were going for anywhere from $ 200,000-500 ,000 . 
  even some that were in the $ 1,000,000 + range if you wanted a mansion in a gated neighborhood . 
  this is what prices were before the crash though . 
  no idea what they are now . 
  if i catch a fellow american overseas acting like an asshat i will tear them apart . 
  i did n't spend two months of work money just getting my ass over the ocean ( let alone all other expenses ) on my non existant vacation time ( i do n't get any paid days off all year ) just so you can act like a fuck and give all of us a bad name . 
  not only that , but they 're annoying me too and probably more than you guys since i 'm ( for better or worse ) associated with them . 
  fuck all of that noise . 
  it does n't work at all . 
  the electoral college is a fucking 250 year old joke . 
  just a couple elections ago bush won the election even though he * lost the popular vote * . 
  if you live in a solid red or blue state and you vote the other way , your vote effectively means shit . 
  once your state goes red or blue ** all ** the electoral votes of your state go that way . 
  that 's not even the kicker , those electoral votes ? 
  yeah , those are each individually controlled by actual representatives . 
  they can actually basically tell a state to go fuck themselves and vote the way they want instead of how the state wanted . 
  it 's happened before , it 's called a faithless elector . 
  where do you see that ? 
  the stereotypical german as portrayed in the us is a lederhosen wearing guy at oktoberfest . 
  the most recent `` germans = nazis '' bullshit i 've seen was in greek newspapers . 
  we * ca n't * vote for anybody we wish . 
  i do n't think you understand how the american electoral system works . 
  shut the fuck up you american piece of shit . 
  we do n't come here to fucking hear your bullshit . 
  * you know what you did * . 
  what the ** fuck ** do you want me to do ? 
  no matter * what * i fucking do , cunts like you are going to have a problem with my goddamn government . 
  it does n't matter who i fucking voted for , because you do n't really give a shit do you ? 
  there are 300 fucking million americans . 
  yes . 
  ** yes ** !, 
  we 're ** all ** fucking responsible for fucking everything our government does . 
  i have barrack fucking obamas phone number in my pocket and i can call and him and be like `` hey barry can you stop bombing people in pakistan ? '', 
  seriously , get the fuck off your high horse . 
  what fucking country are you from ? 
  let me fucking tell ** you ** what exactly is wrong with your country and how it 's ** your fucking fault ** . 
  i 'm so fucking done with this shit , i 'm fucking out . 
  who exactly are they threatened by ? 
  they can take care of themselves , especially if there is a strong eu military alliance . 
  we have so many overseas bases it 's ridiculous and disgusting . 
  if we spent a fraction of that money * here * in our country maybe we would n't have infrastructure that is literally crumbling , an education system that is a joke and a country where getting sick does n't have to mean financial ruin for most of us . 
  * i * have n't `` liberated '' fuck all . 
  there 's a difference between spying on state and government data and private data . 
  nobody is denying every country on the planet keeps tabs on what the other governments of the world are doing , even infiltrating their systems when they can . 
  but spying on private citizens is another matter , i think it 's safe to say that we 're one of the only ones doing that ( possibly a few others , china , iran , russia and israel come to mind ) . 
  it 's completely fucked . 
  i can honestly say that although i have n't been proud to be an american since i ended adolescence , right now i am completely ashamed to have to admit to being one and to having a u.s. passport . 
  i really hope their is a huge international backlash and ** somebody ** tells us to go fuck ourselves . 
  hopefully one of our allies . 
  fun fact : `` monday '' is slang for a black person . 
  edit : i guess it 's not a fun fact after all : /, 
  am i doing it right !? 
  generally i try to tiptoe around . 
  i can never tell when me adding to the discussion will be welcomed or if i 'll be run off . 
  i usually just stay away from any of the threads that involve the u.s. 
  learned those lessons the hard way . 
  nope . 
  you mean just like how you would n't compare a country to a union of countries since those are n't the same political entities either ? 
  you do n't compare pears to oranges to you ? 
  for every one us-eu comparison i see made by americans i see ten eu-us comparisons made here in r/europe ... 
  yes , i 'm asking why is it ok to do one but not the other ? 
  i do n't actually think us states and european countries should be compared . 
  i 'm trying to get somebody to explain to me why the us must be compared only to the eu as a whole and not individual countries . 
  my point was why is it fair to compare one country to a whole union when the reverse is not ok . 
  it makes no sense to me . 
  states have individual histories ... 
  they did not all join the union at the same time or even remotely the same time . 
  all i 'm trying to say is that if it 's alright to compare the * entire * eu to the u.s. ( * one * country ) then why is it not ok to compare individual states within the u.s. to countries within the eu ? 
  you mean like how the various states have varying histories and culture ? 
  why not ? 
  the logic i 've seen in this thread is that population and economy must be equivalent or close to it . 
  texas , california , new york and illinois all fit those requirements . 
  i just think it 's great how 18 year olds can be sent into combat , vote , get married , etc. 
  but have a beer after work and you 're a criminal . 
  the age should be 18 imo . 
  although in a lot of states you can drink underage in your home . 
  am i allowed to compare individual us states to european countries then ? 
  how many major languages are spoken within england ? 
  germany ? 
  france ? 
  the linguistic variation is about the same . 
  eh i 'm not a huge basketball fan ( da bears all day !!! ), 
  but the general consensus seems to be that he 's been out way too long . 
  especially considering how much he gets paid and how expensive tickets are . 
  economies sure , population is a stretch . 
  saying that there are no cultural , linguistic , religious or ethnic diversity in the us is absurd . 
  that 's what we 're * known for * . 
  if we 're so much less diverse then why is it insisted that the u.s. be compared to * all * of europe ? 
  that 's not fair at all . 
  would you compare japan to nato ? 
  why no comparison of canada or china to the eu ? 
  as it 's so popular to point out , the eu is made up of many different countries . 
  why then is n't the us compared to * individual * countries within the eu ? 
  i do n't believe in australia . 
  i think the main thing is that the drinking age is 21 so when you 're finally away from home for the first time unsupervised you tend to go a bit ... crazy . 
  haha were the american college parties everything you had hoped ?
