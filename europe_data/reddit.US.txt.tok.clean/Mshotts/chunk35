  i 'd kill myself . 
  i 'll be looking for full time work come next week when we 're out for the summer . 
  i also need to pick up a job next year while i 'm at school or i 'll have to go to the soup kitchen haha . 
  is it true that you guys get to go to school and the hospital for free in europe ? 
  i usually did it right before class or not at all . 
  just did n't have time . 
  yeah , it was a bitch . 
  get up at 7 for school and that goes until about 3 . 
  then change in the car and drive the 12 miles/25 minutes to work to pick up the second shift and you 'd get off at about 11:00 pm or 12:00 am . 
  then drive back home and try to be in bed by 1 . 
  i know plenty of people that started working for family run places at like 12 or 13 . 
  i also knew people who applied for work permits so they could start at 15 . 
  basically , your parents would provide food , housing and clothing . 
  anything else you wanted was on you . 
  i remember my boss got really mad at me when i was 18 and he wanted me to work a 12 am -8 am shift and i told him no because i had school in the morning xd i also remember how the management was a bunch of pricks and they 'd schedule you right up to 39 hours and then cut you off . 
  they have to give health insurance at 40 hours . 
  i remember one girl i worked with could n't see a doctor for a nasty ear infection because she had no insurance . 
  she ended up in the emergency room . 
  that was sad . 
  i also got really pissed off when i found out i was paying a higher percentage of tax than mitt romney was . 
  on my fucking minimum wage . 
  try living off of $ 7.25 / hour sometime mr. romney . 
  fucking cocksucker . 
  edit : oh yeah , i worked retail for a long time . 
  that sucked . 
  people are assholes . 
  then , i worked at a chemical plant . 
  pay was really good and you know your job is interesting when you 're issued a gas mask on your first day .

  sorry for getting a little carried away guys . 
  i got excited . 
  often , i feel ashamed of my country and countrymen but it is a beautiful land and i like to show it to people who may not know so much about it . 
  it 's because people ca n't afford to eat healthy . 
  it sounds stupid , but fast food is so cheap that many people simply eat that all the time because you can get much more food at mcdonalds than that same amount of money will get you healthy food at the grocery store . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that we as a country have * much * larger problems than people celebrating the capture of a terrorism suspect . 
  i 'm saying the mainstream u.s. media does not focus at all on world events . 
  it 's solely u.s. coverage or when it is international it 's still focused on how it affects the u.s. 
  the only way you can get real news from outside the u.s. is to look for an outside source . 
  bbc , dw or whatever . 
  but how many people even know about those options and even if they do , it 's limited to checking out their website and plenty of people i know only get news from sitting down and watching the evening news . 
  no need to be a condescending prick . 
  i really do n't think they do . 
  not u.s. media anyway . 
  they may pose and squawk about integrity so they can sleep at night but at the end of the day actions speak louder than words . 
  do you really think the media of the u.s. gives a damn about journalistic ethics or integrity ? 
  it 's all about the ratings . 
  ~ ~ i could care less about this , thousands of people celebrating in the street after a terrorism suspect has been captured , when they 've been staying inside all day and most of them have probably been drinking . ~ ~ ~ ~ do you know what scares me ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.propublica.org/images/ngen/gypsy_big_image/ap_boston_police_hunt_630x420_130419.jpg ) and [ police searching homes without warrants ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcra5sptqs1o0lv9nkcqqqaedcfhynl7_o0p7h8zundruauri8mn ) . ~ ~ who cares about discussion when there 's grammar to attack !, 
  that 's how it 's * supposed * to be . 
  in practice though if you 're accused of a crime you 're done . 
  you can be found innocent but your life is ruined . 
  so you get to claim all of europe when it suits you yet you get to claim individual statehood when it suits you . 
  that * is * the culture . 
  it 's absolutely a celebration of the lack of education . 
  the thing is , everybody has facebook and twitter regardless of education . 
  do you think the people with college degrees are posting that kind of stuff ? 
  the thing is , that 's not what makes the news and reinforces the stereotype . 
  there could be a video of an american student pointing to the czech republic on a map and none of you would care yet post a picture of a couple tweets of ignorant idiots and front of the page . 
  well , it takes me about 40 hours of driving to get to the nearest country and that 's canada . 
  if you want to travel to another country from the u.s. you have to be prepared to invest about $ 5,000 - $ 10,000 per person . 
  first off most people ca n't afford that . 
  it 's going on a vacation or being able to afford health insurance or your house payment . 
  even if you could afford it you most likely ca n't take the time off work to go without losing your job . 
  you do n't get many paid vacation days and most people save those for the days when they 're sick . 
  i get a lot of american stereotypes but not the lazy one . 
  growing up you had a job by the time you were 16 . 
  i ca n't think of a single person who i went to high school with that was n't working about 30 hours a week while also going to school full time . 
  plenty of adults had 2 or even 3 jobs . 
  we * do n't get * news from outside the us . 
  you must actively seek it out . 
  hence why some of us are here . 
  that does n't excuse it , but it explains it . 
  you most likely had a better education . 
  well it 's understandable .
