  i mean just because you went to school for the same amount of time does n't mean you are as capable as someone else who went just as long as you but was in a better system . 
  where can you hide a black mans welfare check where he 'll never find it ? 
  in his work boots . 
  nah , i 'm just laid back apparently . 
  i think they 're badass too , that 's why minnesota is alright . 
  but wisconsin does n't have vikings and they 're a bunch of cheese-head fudgepackers anyway . 
  haha stereotypes are always fun . 
  also , fuck wisconsin . 
  haha i had fun with it . 
  [ happy ? 
  if you wan na kill people come on and pay us a visit . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  it all has to do with socioeconomic status and opportunity . 
  you 'll notice crime is much higher with uneducated and impoverished whites than among their university educated middle-class counterparts as well . 
  i call it the `` less rednecks effect '' . 
  edit : it was a joke , calm the fuck down . 
  i also come from the south side of chicago so do n't fucking explain to me how `` rednecks are n't the only violent ones '' . 
  football , the other one . 
  hockey and wrestling ( amateur and not the fake kind ) but that may be a regional thing ( midwest ) . 
  why did n't you say you were from minnesoooooooooota :p . 
  i 'm from the south side of chicago so i ca n't talk too much either . 
  i think the accents and dialects of the u.s. are fascinating . 
  we have so much diversity for one country . 
  i just disagreed with your assertion that we can all understand each other regardless of accent or dialect . 
  sure , 90 % of the time we can , but there are those accents and dialects where i personally have a hard time understanding them . 
  i mean , we do have tv shows highlighting particular regions that are subtitled . 
  honestly though i do n't really think it 's fair to blame them for their own impoverishment and lack of education . 
  so do i. 
  oh damn it why did you show them that . 
  for the record , these people are jackasses and if it was `` standard american culture '' , we would n't make a tv show out of it . 
  we find it as ridiculous as you do . 
  have you heard those people from the bayou ? 
  i ca n't understand a word they say . 
  you would be court-martialed if you * did n't * refuse to obey an illegal order would n't you ? 
  thanks , 
  i think it 's good but at the same time our system is fucked up . 
  there 's just about no social floor . 
  all i want is to be able to retire at 65 , send my children to good schools and be able to go to a doctor when i 'm sick . 
  i 'm not entitled to those things . 
  my tax dollars go to build bombs and to ensure billionaires and corporations ( supreme court ruled that they 're people after all ! ), 
  do n't have to pay taxes . 
  i think our self reliance culture is good in general but it 's gotten out of hand . 
  good points  . 
  i do n't really know much about the military relationships in the eu . 
  for instance , what would happen if a eu member state was attacked by an outsider ? 
  would it be similar to if a nato member was attacked ? 
  are there any current treaties regarding military alliances in the eu ? 
  sorry if my questions are stupid , but we do n't really learn a whole lot about european politics or your ( and our ) military relationships outside of `` they 're our friends and if someone attacked them we 'd fuck them up '' . 
  i think the automatic cuts you 're referring to were related to the fiscal cliff . 
  it 's pretty hard to follow and i 'm probably messing it up . 
  but , if congress did n't reach a budget deal there were going to be automatic cuts to spending for pretty much all aspects of government spending . 
  we avoided it by increasing our debt ceiling . 
  i think we only delayed it by a few months though . 
  if we had gone into the automatic spending cuts , nearly all the experts predicted we 'd fall back into recession and probably the world economy along with us . 
  personally , i do n't want the automatic spending cuts , i want * real * cuts passed with our future budgets . 
  the fact that we are responsible for 43 % of the world military spending is ridiculous . 
  our generals and military in general say they literally ca n't spend all the money we give them . 
  we have children starving , millions live in poverty , millions work 3 jobs and ca n't afford healthcare . 
  it 's fucked up . 
  it 's not the 1980s , it 's not the cold war . 
  if we spent a little more on foreign aid and this little thing called * diplomacy * that our politicians seem to have never heard of we might not need to spend so damn much on our military in the first place . 
  sorry , end rant . 
  i kinda like this troll . 
  got ta stop feeding ` im though : /, 
  it 's really just semantics but with saying `` the constitution '' it 's supposed to give more of a solid and specific `` ok , this is what we 're supposed to be fighting to protect '' rather than `` the flag '' which just invokes general feelings of national pride and broad ideals . 
  it was me being nitpicky . 
  as far as the president goes , i was just trying to clarify that although the president is the commander in chief he probably does nothing more than issue broad orders ( remember , only congress can declare war ) . 
  for example `` invade iraq and afghanistan '' , would be the order the president would issue . 
  the generals would then : `` wut . 
  uh , okay . 
  we 'll attack here and send a patrol here , etc. '' . 
  according to your sources only 1/3rd of texans believed texas has the right to secede and 75 % would oppose secession . 
  the last time they tried it did n't end well . 
  it wo n't happen . 
  we would fuck them up . 
  it 's perfectly understandable that you do n't want the eu to become `` one nation '' . 
  personally i think if you guys formed an even tighter coalition it would be good . 
  but i 'm not going to stand here and tell you that i know anything on the subject . 
  like you said , that 's mostly an issue for you guys . 
  in your opinion , could it work ? 
  according to wikipedia , the eu together spent [ 194,357,000,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union#european_military_expenditure ) euros on their armed forces in 2010 . 
  the united states military budget for 2011 was [ $ 664,840,000,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_budget_of_the_united_states ) . 
  the european union has [ 1,700,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union#european_military_personnel ) active military personnel according to wikipedia . 
  the united states ( again , according to wikipedia ) has about [ 1,500,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_military#personnel_in_each_service ) active military personnel . 
  the eu kicks the u.s. 's ass when it comes to reserves , about 2,800,000 to 850,000 . 
  keep in mind though , that the united states selective services currently has 16,200,000 18-26 year old men on file for conscription . 
  i do n't know man , i think it would be close in numbers but i just do n't think you can match our spending . 
  how about we never find out , 
  is it cool if i suggest all canadian users have their comments per-approved unless they concern maple syrup or hockey ? 
  tell me again why i had to register for conscription and none of my female schoolmates had to ? 
  american soldiers swear to defend the united states constitution and to obey all orders from the president of the united states of america and all their superior officers . 
  [ source ] ( http://usmilitary.about.com/od/joiningthemilitary/a/oathofenlist.htm ) . 
  the only ones who take different oaths are our national guardsmen ( militias ) and the only difference to their oaths is they also swear to defend their individual states and to obey all orders from the governor of their state . 
  the president * is * our commander in chief , but i doubt he makes anything other than the occasional very broad orders . 
  most of the actual strategy and whatnot is left up to the generals . 
  i 'd also like to point out that the reason texas wo n't secede is n't because they could n't defeat the federal military ( they could n't though ) but because only a handful of idiots actually think it 's a good idea . 
  to put it simply , self-reliance . 
  welfare is a dirty word here . 
  you ca n't make it on your own ? 
  fuck you , you 're not working hard enough .
