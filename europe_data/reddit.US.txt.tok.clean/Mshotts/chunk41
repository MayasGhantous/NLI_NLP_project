  i 've never heard of anyone taking paternity leave here . 
  i just assumed it does n't exist . 
  most fathers i know just take the day or two off for the birth and are usually back after that . 
  you 're right , although it does say that '' willful acts over the age of 18 with the intention of relinquishing united states nationality '' can cause you to lose your u.s. citizenship , whatever that means . 
  i 'm a little confused , i thought once you accepted citizenship of another country you have to give up your u.s. citizenship ? 
  i 'm guessing there are exceptions ? 
  paternity leave ? 
  that 's a thing ? 
  is the grid infrastructure across europe standardized ? 
  i mean to say , would electricity be able to travel across europe without issue ? 
  forgive me if i 'm wrong , but is n't there also an attempt to get to a certain percentage of green or renewable energy in germany by 2020 ?

  even if something * did * come up , i just ca n't see nato letting something go down in our `` backyard '' . 
  yeah . 
  fuck texas anyway , the un can have it if they want . 
  they want to secede anyway . 
  i 'm sure they could if they wanted to . 
  but in california this last election cycle it was decided companies do n't have to label gmos as such . 
  they do n't have to tell us because it could cause `` unnecessary negative association '' or some shit like that . 
  tell me about it . 
  i think if we had * real * news networks it may make a difference though . 
  it 's so profit driven it 's ridiculous . 
  i had cnn on in the background ( which is about as neutral as it gets ) and it goes like this : suicide bombing at our turkish embassy !, 
  it 's really bad !, 
  we 're not going to tell you anything about it until you sit through 5 minutes of commercials though . 
  ok , you 're back ? 
  good . 
  now here 's our panel of `` experts '' who are going to wildly speculate about what happened . 
  ** breaking news !!, 
  ** : holy shit !, 
  look at egypt !, 
  they 're attacking the fucking presidential residence !, 
  oh my god !, 
  this is really intense !, 
  i 'm not going to give you any information though !!, 
  just watch this live feed for 5 seconds of people fucking shit up in the street !, 
  we 'll tell you what 's happening , i swear !, 
  just watch these advertisements really fast . 
  ok , you 're back ? 
  good . 
  yeah , we have no idea what 's happening so we 're going to go to our story about jeffrey the water-skiing squirrel ok ? 
  that should entertain you for 3 minutes right ? 
  it 's a joke . 
  i can just picture the shit storm if the situation were reversed . 
  i have to listen on a daily basis to drivel about how if we sign things like the u.n. charter on the rights of the child the u.n. will invade texas or some shit . 
  it 's kind of like `` so what '' though . 
  if you want to do business in europe , you play by european rules . 
  i can just imagine the shit storm if `` them socialist europeans is trying to tell us what to do ! '', 
  the situation were reversed . 
  i love you . 
  probably . 
  keep it up . 
  here in the states we 're not even allowed to know if the food we eat has been genetically modified . 
  keep that shit up europe . 
  i may be completely misunderstanding this , but the eu trying to protect the privacy of it 's citizens is what would be causing a `` trade war '' ? 
  give me a break . 
  let me guess , alabama and mississippi ? 
  trust me , americans will find a way . 
  ` murica and all that . 
  cool !, 
  you learn something every day . 
  i 'm not sure if ours are also standardized to 5 and 15 ml though . 
  it seems likely . 
  i do n't know , i think they tried it awhile back and people just did n't take to it . 
  i think they gave up way too early though . 
  we all `` learn '' it in school , but the only time it 's used is in science classes or when purchasing drugs . 
  i could manage measuring out scientific stuff or how much marijuana i want or something , but tell me `` i 'm xx meters tall '' or `` that city is 54 km '' away and i have no idea what we 're talking about . 
  it was interesting trying to explain to my german friend our system . 
  12 inches to a foot , 3 feet to a yard , 5,280 feet to a mile . 
  i could n't even tell you how it works with fluids , i know 4 quarts = one gallon , but i do n't know how many cups are in a quart . 
  to make things more confusing we also use fluid ounces and certain items are actually measured in liters . 
  we only really use pounds for weight , but once it gets large enough we switch to tons ( 2,000 lbs ) or small enough and we switch to ounces , 16 of which make up a pound ( lots of drugs ) or even grams ( drugs ) and milligrams ( prescription drugs ) ( one ounce = 28.35 grams ) . 
  when measuring small substances ( usually for cooking/baking ) we use teaspoons , tablespoons and cups [ standard in every american kitchen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:4measuringspoons.jpg ) , i 'm curious , does anywhere in europe use the teaspoon/tablespoon method ? 
  i 've never heard anyone mention it . 
  when measuring land we usually use square feet ( rooms and houses ) , acres ( larger property ) and square miles ( cities , countries , etc. ), 
  horribly inefficient and confusing , but it 's what we grow up with . 
  edit : turns out we did [ try it back in the 70s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metrication_in_the_united_states ) but it did n't work out . 
  the only ones who really use metric is our military to ensure cohesion with our allies and our scientists to share their work abroad . 
  yeah , like me . 
  do n't generalize about 1/3rd of a billion people . 
  to you maybe . 
  here he 's considered borderline socialist :p, 
  well i 'm not sure if it was true or not . 
  that was just my knowledge/interest in politics at the age of 8 . 
  i meant about you hating obama . 
  just curious . 
  you 're right , all 315,000,000 of us think the exact same way . 
  not when corporations get to spend [ $ 6 ** billion ** on elections ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/07/6-billion-campaign-funds_n_2088839.html ), 
  i have to say , looking at your comment history is fairly interesting . 
  for my fellow backward americans , one meter = ~ 3.3 feet . 
  do you mind me asking why ? 
  well the first time around i was probably only 8 or so . 
  the only thing i `` knew '' about the election was that supposedly the other guy wanted to go to a year round school system . 
  which to my 8 year old mind was simply unacceptable . 
  i stayed up until at least 9 p.m. fretting over whether or not i 'd wake up to the news that school was now year round . 
  does that count ? 
  i think i read somewhere that they have to ensure they ca n't find any eu citizens before they hire an american or other outsider . 
  any truth to that ? 
  please do n't forget to separate the people ( some of us anyway ) from our government . 
  i see , i did not know that before .
