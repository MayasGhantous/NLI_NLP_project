  thank you !, 
  it would be useful if the graph denoted which countries have already legalized it . 
  i did n't know that , thank you !, 
  although i do n't get an ego stroke i 'm glad people have the freedom to marry who they love . 
  do n't take this the wrong way , but i kind of want the u.s. to legalize it before european countries . 
  just because we get so much crap for being `` uncivilized , uncultured rednecks '' . 
  it would please me . 
  well that 's cool , too bad foreign language education in the u.s. is a joke . 
  damn !, 
  small fucking world . 
  haha my mom 's from there and she always says oven mitt . 
  she loves hating on people from the up too . 
  it would please me if you would move your `` information missing '' box just a little bit more north west . 
  you 've included chicago and chicagoland in there . 
  well you got the mormons , bible belt and old people dead on . 
  right ? 
  what are the chances ? 
  steelmen so i 'm guessing joliet central ? 
  i went to lincoln-way west , 
  new lenox/joliet . 
  you ? 
  that sort of behavior may be tolerated and accepted in europe , but here in the u.s. it is * not * . 
  and * we 're * called uncivilized . 
  i also just realized you 're the same person i was having a polite and pleasant discussion with down below , do n't take this the wrong way but ... 
  i 'll take every african in the world in my country over one racist , uneducated prick such as yourself . 
  i 'm supporting the proposed assault weapons ban . 
  i understand that very few murders are committed with these weapons , i 'll even agree it should n't be the main focus , but they should still be banned . 
  as far as handguns go , the average modern handgun still has much more killing power ( rounds per minute ) than a historical musket . 
  my point is , times have changed and the amendment needs to change to reflect the times we live in , not the time in which it was written . 
  i 'm not advocating complete removal of the second amendment , far from it . 
  that being said , the time is long past for * common sense * measures , which according to polling , most americans ( even gun owners and nra members ) are in favor of . 
  * mandatory * background and mental health checks , better access to mental health care , more thorough and strict licensing procedures , better and more efficient enforcement of existing laws and stamp out all of the gun show loopholes . 
  also , you can make all the laws in the world and it wo n't make a difference with the saturation in the american gun market . 
  we are the most heavily armed private population on the planet ( something like 90 firearms for every 100 people ) . 
  tax the shit out of firearms and ammunition , tax the shit out of manufacturers . 
  get guns off the street . 
  after evidence has been collected from guns used in crimes , destroy them . 
  market saturation needs to go way down before we 'll see a dent in gun violence , the availability is ridiculous . 
  finally , gun violence is not only a problem in and of itself , it 's also a symptom of deeper cultural and societal issues . 
  including but not limited to : welfare , education , economic inequality and lack of opportunity and others . 
  new and better gun laws may do a dent in our ridiculous homicide numbers and rates , but until we solve the underlying problems we 're just slapping band-aids on metaphorical gun shot wounds ( no pun intended ) . 
  sorry , i cant hear you over our *** freedom *** . 
  seriously though , fuck this shit . 
  do you honestly think you and your buddies hiding out in the woods would last more than 3 seconds against our military ? 
  sledgehammer , meet ant . 
  i 'm not buying into the whole tyrannical government hypothesis either . 
  our military is mainly made up of working and middle class people , the same people our government would theoretically be attempting to oppress . 
  good luck trying to convince your average 18 year old working class or middle class kid he needs to go into * his * neighborhoods door to door rounding people up , * killing * his friends , neighbors and family . 
  if we 're * serious * about preventing tyranny of government , we can start by overturning citizens united and getting big corporate money the * fuck out * of our politics ( [ $ 6 ** billion ** spent this past election cycle ] ( http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/11/most-expensive-election-history-numbers/58745/ ) ) then if we can get people to actually have fucking attention spans and watch * real * news ( not that we have t.v. 
  news channels that come close to european news ) and make informed decisions we may be able to achieve something . 
  you operate on hypothetical scenarios , i operate on * facts * . 
  our murder rate and overall number is disgusting compared to every other western nation . 
  time to join the 21st century . 
  it 's not the fucking cold war anymore . 
  time to * embrace * and work * with * the rest of the world . 
  not me . 
  but i do get downvoted to oblivion/verbally butchered when i speak up :'( . 
  so i just shut my mouth and plan on riding it out . 
  that amendment was written nearly 3 centuries ago ... 
  when it was written , the continent was far from settled . 
  there was n't exactly a grocery store on each corner either . 
  the framers were talking about smooth-bore muskets . 
  today we 're talking about military grade assault rifles that can unleash more firepower in 2 seconds than 20 men armed with muskets could achieve in 2 minutes . 
  it 's also important to keep in mind that we had just fought our war of independence . 
  one of the major grievances the colonists had was the quartering act ( british troops would be housed in private homes ) , there was huge distrust towards a professional army and a central government in general . 
  our constitution needs to be changed to reflect the realities of the 21st century . 
  they are called * amendments * after all . 
  39 ... that 's just unfathomable to me . 
  [ in my city alone last year more people were killed by guns than u.s. troops killed in afghanistan ] ( http://www.inquisitr.com/257478/more-americans-killed-in-chicago-than-in-afghanistan/ ) , including 11 killed and 40 wounded in [ ** one weekend ** ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/29/chicago-shootings-10-dead_n_1552297.html ) . 
  i do n't even know what emotion i should be feeling right now . 
  vs. [ 87 dead and 183 wounded ** a day ** ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/24/87-gun-deaths-a-day-why-the-colorado-shooting-is-tragically-unsurprising.html ) ... un . 
  believable . 
  well i 'm certainly not the most qualified person on the subject , but i 'd say no . 
  it just seems there 's too big of differences in language , culture , economic status , demographics , climate , etc. 
  from an outside perspective the eu is awesome by the way . 
  the insurgency in the [ north caucasus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insurgency_in_the_north_caucasus ) or the [ kosovo-serbia border clashes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_kosovo-serbia_border_clashes ) . 
  perhaps not full blown wars but conflicts with the potential to escalate for sure . 
  yes , but the u.s. military is made up of individuals . 
  those individuals are ( according to studies ) more willing to fight combatants of a different race than them . 
  yeah that 's a pretty good explanation . 
  the culture is absolutely american , you could plop any of us there and we 'd be just fine ( more than fine in the case of hawaii ) . 
  the big thing is their natural features , which is probably what brings in most domestic tourists . 
  to me and most people i know they 're just like any other state . 
  the only real difference is that they 're so much farther away . 
  there 's plenty of conflicts around the world involving a multitude of peoples . 
  studies during and after the second world war showed that for american soldiers it was psychologically easier to kill a japanese soldier than a german soldier . 
  it was found race played an important role in this . 
  believe what you want , but the studies back me up . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're saying . 
  we 've been attacking `` brown '' peoples for the past decade yes . 
  the u.s. is 72 % white . 
  the next highest racial group is hispanics with 16 % or 50,000,000 . 
  bit of a difference . 
  yeah when i think europe , britain is included in that . 
  very true . 
  well the military will supposedly pay for your university expenses after you put in your 4/8 years but i 've heard of people getting screwed over . 
  but if you have the money , you go to university . 
  for plenty of people their only real options are the military or trade school . 
  our volunteer military is probably mostly made up of working class and lower middle class people . 
  i know when i graduated high school you went to college if you could , if you did n't have the grades or money your options were join the army/marines or work at mcdonalds .
