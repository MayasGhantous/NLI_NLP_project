  i agree , there is a difference . 
  i would argue that although we may not have mandatory military service , for millions the military is their only real option in life . 
  sorry for being sensitive . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're trying to prove with that map , the u.s. is the exact same color as most of europe . 
  for the u.s. it 's called a [ backdoor draft ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stop-loss_policy ) and it 's highly unethical and debated . 
  our soldiers are more likely to kill themselves than die on the battlefield so do n't tell me it 's not a fucking problem . 
  yes , we 're discussing conscription . 
  like i said , all able bodied men between the age of 18 and 25 are registered with the selective services . 
  if a draft were instituted , numbers would be drawn almost immediately . 
  the systems differ , but to say conscription does not exist in the u.s. is disingenuous . 
  if i 'm not welcome in the conversation let me know and i 'll be more than happy to get my fat ass out of here to go play with my gun and eat fried chicken . 
  our reservists are sent over there all the time . 
  there 's backdoor drafts where once your 4 years are up they can snag you for more time . 
  not gon na argue that one , 
  about that ... 
  haha , we 've got our plans in place too . 
  i firmly believe that when our congress declares war , every member of congress or an immediate family member must be part of the * first wave * . 
  we 'll see how many wars we get into then  . 
  joke probably is n't the best word choice . 
  it just seems so unlikely , but if it came down to it we 'd be hauling ass for the border . 
  again , depends on the situation . 
  invasion , i 'm down , give me my rifle . 
  `` alright boys , go over there and kill those brown people because freedom and shit '' . 
  fuck that , canada here we come . 
  would anyone mind explaining to me how this works ? 
  do you just show up somewhere when you hit that age ? 
  here in the states all able bodied males have to register with the selective services within something like 90 days of our 18th birthday . 
  i do n't really remember much of it because it took about 15 minutes . 
  i think i may have gotten a draft number and a card but i do n't remember . 
  if you do n't register you ca n't receive government financial aid for university and i think you can technically be fined/imprisoned ( never heard of this happening though ) . 
  you 're also supposed to inform them if you move , but nobody ever does . 
  myself and most of my friends do n't like it , but we do n't think about it much . 
  it 's been so long since there was a draft , if it happened now there would probably be some serious demonstrations . 
  the big joke is we 'd all take off for canada  . 
  is it a somewhat similar situation ? 
  haha good point , that 's why we try to keep them contained . 
  they wo n't let you educate them , this may sound absurd but i 've grown up among people like this . 
  education is something to be sneered at to them . 
  you can have it and the oil !, 
  but you have to keep * all * the people . 
  sure , they seem harmless at first but try living with them !, 
  not that i 'm aware of . 
  if you 're thinking stereotypical redneck american you 're thinking bible belt . 
  it 's implying he ( and all other senators ) should be acting in the best interests of the united states of america , not israel . 
  i want to . 
  the last time my country was at peace i was 8 years old ... 
  i 'm 20 now . 
  i want to know what it 's like to live at peace . 
  uh oh , retard alert . 
  stand your ground laws ... : / yes , that 's a thing here ... whatever you do , * do n't * let people start buying guns all willy-nilly . 
  yeah everyone should just walk around with guns all the time . 
  ask me how that one 's working out over here  . 
  * ask * . 
  now i 'm all for religious tolerance and acceptance but ... fuck . 
  that . 
  shit . 
  apparently mali did and the french requested logistical and technological support . 
  i 've been unable to find french or malian sources for this though . 
  besides , when has our presence not being requested been an obstacle to us getting involved : / . 
  yeah i 'm more than happy to sit this one out personally ... 
  one of the picks for obama 's new cabinet ( secretary of defense ) almost got lynched by the republicans just for saying `` i am a united states senator , * not * an israeli senator '' , and he 's from their own damn party !, 
  i 'm not sure there are enough people living there to maintain them anyway though . 
  9 people per square mile or something like that xd . 
  but no , the nukes do n't come with nd , they get dismantled :d, 
  hmm ... how about idaho , wyoming , north and south dakota ? 
  the chinese are trying to get in on that action so i suggest you act quickly !, 
  just sign : here - x ___________________________________ edit : forget to mention , order in the next 30 minutes and i 'll * give * you the bible belt :d, 
  will you take the bible belt ? 
  question here , forgive me if it 's stupid or ignorant . 
  does this apply to people of all religions ? 
  are jews allowed to wear yarmulkes at work , sikhs to wear turbans , muslims to wear veils , etc. 
  decriminalization of illicit drugs . 
  it 's absurd how many people we lock up . 
  end the war on marijuana , lsd , mdma , dmt , mushrooms and few others for sure . 
  perhaps forcible rehab for things like meth and heroin , but not prison . 
  also , reducing the amount of money made by our private prison industry . 
  it 's disgusting how much profit is made off of imprisoning people and how much incentive there is for keeping as many people as possible behind bars for as long as possible . 
  it would also be nice if the rich , powerful and famous were held to the same legal standards as the rest of us , but there i go being a dreamer  . 
  they can withhold federal funding when states have policies the federal government disagrees with . 
  like drinking ages . 
  right there with you . 
  damn straight . 
  or even dump you once you become too expensive . 
  i had a surgery on my knee when i was 17 and our insurance company sent us a bill for $ 12,000 ... we thought it was just a simple mistake but we ended up having to fight tooth and nail to get it righted . 
  insurance companies and our healthcare industry ( pathetic that it 's all driven by $ $ $ ) in general is a racket . 
  if you go for a very bare bones basic view then yes . 
  however , large chunks of obamacare do n't go into effect until 2014 and other bits and pieces do n't come into effect until 2016-2020 . 
  unfortunately , universal health insurance is far from universal healthcare . 
  i do n't think anybody is really sure how it will all work out yet right now anyway . 
  automobile insurance is legally required and plenty of companies advertise under the sole premise of keeping you `` legal '' . 
  so i have my doubts . 
  it should also be understood that obamacare is not a final product but more of baby steps to eventual universal healthcare ( about damn time ) . 
  do n't even get me started on those `` government death panels '' ... 
  remember , a huge percentage of americans who have or do receive government food stamps or health care programs do n't know they utilize government run welfare programs . 
  tl ; dr : americans are stupid . 
  key word : * enough * . 
  millions miss out . 
  besides , then taxpayers just end up footing the bill . 
  it 's horribly inefficient . 
  we actually spend much more per capita on healthcare and the care is subpar .
