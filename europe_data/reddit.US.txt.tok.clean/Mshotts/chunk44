  few different scenarios : have great health insurance , get into hospital , get treated , pay a bit out of pocket . 
  have bad insurance , get into hospital ( eventually ) , get kinda treated , pay a lot . 
  have no insurance : option a : do n't go to hospital . 
  option b : go to hospital , financially ruined . 
  no , not content at all . 
  i 'd be interested to know as well . 
  in my german culture classes at university we have n't really gone into depth on parties . 
  i think that generally we 're welcome so long as we adhere to the rules and are respectful to everyone . 
  i like to get a bit of perspective from europeans and i 'd like to think they enjoy the same from non-europeans . 
  i also make sure to generally stay on the topic of * europe * while still contributing and giving my two-cents , since that 's what we 're all here for is n't it ? 
  i was under the impression it was n't `` literature '' since it is oral . 
  a bit stereotypical american literature but here goes : moby dick - herman melville - 1851 the call of the wild - jack london - 1903 the last of the mohicans - james fenimore cooper - 1826 the scarlet letter - nathaniel hawthorne - 1850 the adventures of tom sawyer - mark twain - 1876 the adventures of huckleberry finn - mark twain - 1885 the red badge of courage - stephen crane - 1895 uncle tom 's cabin - harriet beecher stowe - 1852 these are the stereotypical `` american literature classics '' . 
  i 'm probably missing a ton and a bunch of the more contemporary stuff but this is what is considered our `` great literature '' and mainly the ones i personally have enjoyed the most . 
  let me clarify , i had a license at the age of 12 . 
  i would n't have been able to buy weapons from a shop . 
  the gun show thing was more referring to me being able to do such * now * . 
  i did n't make that very clear , my apologies . 
  looking back , absolutely . 
  yeah it 's just a bit too late at this point . 
  it 's a culture issue as well . 
  yes . 
  i could n't `` legally '' buy a gun from a store or something but i was a state licensed firearm owner at the age of twelve . 
  let me put it this way , i was a licensed gun owner at the age of 12 ... about sums it up . 
  i could walk into just about any `` gun show '' in the country and walk out with a firearm . 
  no background check , mental health check or anything . 
  i 'm not sure we have the ability to just take those guns away though . 
  we 're the most heavily armed private citizenry on the planet . 
  last i checked there were 90 firearms for every 100 men , women and children in the u.s. 
  believe me there are plenty of people who buy into the `` you can have my gun when you pry it from my cold dead hands '' bit as well who are just * waiting * for a `` government repossession of firearms '' . 
  i think it 's fairly safe to say we 're screwed here in the states . 
  imagine he 's allowed as many high-powered guns as he wants and letting him out in public while carrying them concealed on him . 
  ftfy, 
  well here is my personal respective ( totally not speaking for americans in general ) : i 'm desensitized . 
  50 + gunned down in a movie theater ? 
  26 ( including 20 children ) butchered at a grade school . 
  huh . 
  hear gun shots while at work ( i work in a pretty bad area ) ? 
  hit the floor and wait it out . 
  nothing you can do about it . 
  either you 'll get hit or you wo n't . 
  there 's just a prevailing feeling that nothing will change . 
  in my city alone last year more people were shot and killed than u.s. troops killed in the middle east . 
  i 'm only 20 and i 've seen the cycle so many times in my life already i 've just kind of totally shut down all feeling for it . 
  you ca n't really survive emotionally otherwise . 
  massive shooting at least once a year , gun control debate for a few weeks , nothing happens , fades away until the next one . 
  this time does seem a little bit different though , just enough to fan the embers that remain of my hopes . 
  probably not . 
  but technically . 
  nobody thought they 'd be macing completely peacefully protesters during the occupy movement either . 
  good thing i said housing and not `` ownership of a house '' then . 
  `` luxuries like housing '' are you fucking serious ? 
  housing , education , healthcare , water and food are ** basic human rights that every human being is entitled to ** . 
  have you been paying attention to these negotiations ? 
  the gop flat out ** refused ** to even look at anything that did n't specifically protect the wealthy from taxes . 
  we have among the ** highest rates of economic inequality in the industrialized world ** . 
  who was just fine with those payroll taxes that will affect a majority of americans ? 
  the republicans . 
  tax billionaires ? 
  you would have thought we were talking about bombing hospitals . 
  who demanded to hold votes to overturn obamacare ( first steps to * real * universal healthcare ) ** 33 times ** ? 
  republicans . 
  gee , i 'm really sorry i want to be able to stay on my parents insurance . 
  what 's that ? 
  government death panels ? 
  give me a fucking break . 
  who just refused to sign onto the un charter regarding rights for the disabled that was ** based off our own americans with disabilities act ** that would have required us to do * nothing * . 
  republicans , spewing some asinine shit about the un `` invading texas '' . 
  yes , we need to check our debt , but raising the debt ceiling just allows us to * pay bills we 've already run up * . 
  if the republicans were serious about our debt they 'd take a good hard look at who and what they 're defending . 
  the sad thing is that if that puts me under the category of `` suspected terrorist '' they * could * be looking at everything i do without a warrant . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriot_act i 'm proud to be an american , where at least i know i 'm free ... ... . 
  uh , yeah . 
  let me get back to you on that . 
  i 'm not sure exactly what you mean . 
  the economy was the # 1 focus of the presidential elections hands down and it continues to be . 
  trust me , the average american is feeling the toll of our bad economy . 
  those guys in washington ? 
  not so much . 
  this past congress was the least productive in our history and the filibuster was used in a pretty much unprecedented manner which means next to nothing got done . 
  very true , and the republicans seem determined to take down the entire ship if the wealthy are n't protected . 
  think of the job creators !, 
  i guess i 'm just a little commie for wanting things like education , healthcare and housing . 
  they did n't hold the door ? 
  barbarians ... 
  i 'll certainly have to check it out though !, 
  i 'm from chicago so my midwestern experience certainly is n't the same as an iowan or whatever . 
  but we have polish newspapers , radio and tv stations . 
  there 's also * huge * ethnic german and irish populations . 
  i 'm not trying to say we 're the same as the east coast . 
  but i 've been both there and the south and can say without a doubt that our culture is more similar to that on the east coast compared to the south . 
  we consider ourselves culturally north . 
  we have * way * more in common with the east coast . 
  sure it 's a bit unique but it 's closer to the east coast than the south . 
  being geographically north is part of that culture as well . 
  haha it 's confusing to us too !, 
  i think that generally federal law supersedes state law . 
  but there are cases where things are legal on a state basis and illegal federally ( see : marijuana ) . 
  things like gay marriage are left up to individual states ( slated for a supreme court ruling soon though which would either overrule * all * state laws if they rule one way or the other . 
  i agree . 
  but socialism is a dirty word here .
