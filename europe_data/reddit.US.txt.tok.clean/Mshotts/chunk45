  to the average american : socialism = communism = soviet union . 
  it depends what area of the `` north '' you 're talking about though ( in the u.s. ) . 
  i 'm from the midwest ( considered the north ) and we find east coasters to be horribly rude . 
  i 'd still say we 're more of `` askers '' than southerners but not as much as people on the northern east coast . 
  well we have laws about discriminating based on gender , religion and race/ethnicity ( sexuality is still unfortunately fair game ) but i could n't really give you a good answer as to whether or not they 're enforced though . 
  when you get fired for `` no reason '' it 's called being `` laid-off '' . 
  it sucks . 
  what if you 're a student and ca n't work that much at all ? 
  are there any laws about protecting them ? 
  i go to school about 40 hours a week and then work about 30 hours a week . 
  i 'm still not legally entitled to anything though . 
  the main problem is that if you do n't go over 40 hours a week you are n't a full time employee and your employer is n't required to give you anything . 
  i have quite literally seen people told to go home for the week as soon as they hit the 39 hour mark . 
  lol . 
  i 've heard they 're really rude and as a good midwestern boy that freaks me out !, 
  but i 'll have to get over that and head over there one day . 
  thanks !, 
  aww ... 
  i just left today for school ( ohio state ) and there 's more here than back home . 
  i figure if it 's going to be cold there might as well be snow !, 
  lol * i * know better , but the average american ? 
  not so much . 
  i 'm from chicago too !, 
  i 'm glad we finally got some snow though , 
  wow ... 
  i feel like i should be * really * pissed off right now . 
  unless you 're on salary employers keep you just under 40 hours a week so they do n't have to provide benefits ( health insurance ) or paid time off . 
  i get * no * paid time off . 
  if i ca n't work , i do n't get paid . 
  if i miss 3-4 days i will lose my job . 
  i am pretty pissed off now . 
  now i feel like a dick . 
  internet hug ? 
  we do n't have sporting events that need to be canceled because of racist chants directed at players . 
  well i ca n't walk to any store . 
  the only public transport is one train station that will take me to chicago ( 40 miles away ) . 
  i ca n't really walk anywhere . 
  my nearest relatives live 30 miles away . 
  the school i went to was 3 miles from home and that 's considered close . 
  the university i now attend is about 400 miles from home . 
  i think you do n't realize how large america is and how spread out everything is . 
  a 6 hour drive is nothing . 
  i used to drive dallas to chicago a few times a year and that 's about 1,000 miles . 
  new york to l.a. is about 2,800 miles . 
  to put that into perspective , it 's like driving from lisbon , portugal to moscow . 
  you need 8 line highways when you have 300 million people all trying to get to work/school at 9 am . 
  do n't change a thing . 
  screw what we say . 
  we 're so uptight and prude it 's ridiculous . 
  at least your countries * have * culture . 
  this . 
  i feel like i 'm a roman watching the end of our empire . 
  do n't put too many eggs in our basket . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , why is new york your favorite city ? 
  i would love to go one day . 
  germany was amazing , i would really love to live there in the near future . 
  i was really pleasantly surprised by austria as well . 
  it was a lot harder for me to understand them , but they were friendly and the landscape was just * gorgeous * , i 've fallen pretty thoroughly in love with the alps . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , how much paid holiday leave * do * you get under eu law ? 
  that would n't be hard at all to do though would it ? 
  thanks , that 's actually pretty enlightening and i 'm not upset anymore . 
  does that mean all it would take is for the bank to require customers to exchange from the u.s. dollar to the euro at a 3rd party before making a deposit to get around this ? 
  i do n't think the u.s. government is very concerned with regulating business when it does n't involve their tax revenue however ... 
  stereotypes ? 
  here goes : ** our neighbors : ** canada : our little brother that 's a bit weird . 
  he is * obsessed * with hockey . 
  maple syrup , cold , eskimos , polite , mounties . 
  mexico : depending on where you go it 's either a tourist heaven where you 're rich if you have $ 5 or it 's a drug infested shithole and you * will * die . 
  ** europe : ** iceland : cold , volcanoes . 
  ireland : drunk all the time , whiskey/guinness , eat lots of potatoes , leprechauns . 
  scottish : braveheart . 
  england : posh , tea , queen and bad dental hygiene . 
  wales : where ? 
  portugal : spain ? 
  spain : mexico ? 
  france : eat frogs , suck at fighting wars , smoke a * lot * , rude/snobby , their women do n't shave their legs or armpits . 
  belgium : weird french people and waffles . 
  netherlands : drugs . 
  luxembourg : where ? 
  germany : nazis , kinky sex , beer , lederhosen . 
  austria : germany 2.0 liechtenstein : where ? 
  switzerland : chocolate and banks . 
  italy : mobsters , pizza/pasta . 
  czech republic : where ? 
  poland : incompetent . 
  norway : vikings . 
  sweden : beautiful women . 
  eastern europe/balkans : we ca n't tell you apart and we think you 're russians . 
  greece : ca n't get their shit together/zeus . 
  russia : you mean the u.s.s.r. right ? 
  finland : where ? 
  if i did n't mention your country , i 'm sorry , americans in general probably are n't aware you exist . 
  europe in general : socialist ( which means communism ) paradise . 
  this is bullshit , how the hell do the irs and us courts have the authority or the jurisdiction to levy fines on swiss banks that are doing * nothing * illegal under * swiss * laws , the ones that matter considering * that 's * where the bank is located . 
  perhaps european nations should start suing u.s. companies for their horrible environmental standards , that after all * does * affect the rest of the world . 
  that 's kind of what i meant to say , there were a ton of similarities but there were two distinct `` cultures '' . 
  i 'd be happy to have you guys as our 51st state sometime soon  . 
  i 'd love to visit !, 
  i 'll add it to my list  . 
  yeah , we were probably 17-18 at the time .
