  she 'd been in the states since she was 10 or so . 
  she had family coming and going all the time and i 'm pretty sure she visited once a year . 
  cheers , 
  now you have to talk about the royal baby for the next 6 hours . 
  you must really be a night owl huh ? 
  it 's almost 9 pm here . 
  i really do n't have much experience with puerto ricans . 
  i only knew one girl who i worked with , her parents would fly in sometimes . 
  she considered herself an american but there was definitely a bit of a cultural difference , but nothing much different than just about any immigrant family . 
  yes . 
  did n't you vote to become a u.s. state in the election anyway ? 
  you 're all u.s. citizens as well too right ? 
  not to mention the youth vote , the female vote , the black vote , the anyone who is n't a 65 year old white man vote ... 
  just noticed that too . 
  no idea . 
  i guess we should revert to what we `` should '' be doing to satisfy them . 
  perhaps you can talk about the queen while i eat mcdonalds and play with a gun ? 
  agreed , i 'm paying $ 35,000 a year for university here . 
  trust me it 's maddening to me as well !, 
  especially because i live here and it 's my tax dollars going to fund our never ending wars and research into newer death machines . 
  especially when that tax surely could n't be spent on things like healthcare ( like i said , i ca n't get any ) , infrastructure ( our bridges and roads are literally falling apart ) , or education ( i pay $ 25,000 a year for university and count myself * lucky * ) , because to my fellow americans that would be * gasp * ** socialism ** . 
  you 're also probably one of the few europeans on right now . 
  it 's 11 pm where i am so it must be very early across the pond . 
  edit : i 'd also like to throw out that last year i paid a higher tax percentage working for minimum wage ( you ca n't live off of it , it 's about $ 14,000 / year ) than mitt romney did . 
  perhaps you 've heard of him  , he has a car * elevator * at his home and a private * valet * at his own * mansion * . 
  the system is utterly absurd and broken . 
  i made around $ 4,000 last year ( working 30 hours a week on top of being a full time student ) and paid a tax rate of about 16 % . 
  mitt romney has a net worth of around $ 250 million and has created accounts worth about $ 100 million for his children . 
  he earned $ 22 million in 2010 and paid an effective tax rate of 14 % . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitt_romney#personal_wealth got ta love * democracy * and * freedom * huh ? 
  personnel does not mean infantry . 
  not this guy , 
  yeah , knowing that if i get sick i have to choose between going to the hospital and becoming financially ruined or staying home and trying to rough it out is stressful . 
  my parents have insurance but it 's tied to their employment . 
  if they leave their jobs to look for new ones they lose their insurance until they get a new job ( assuming their new employer even provides insurance ) . 
  i 'm only 20 so i * should * be able to get back onto my parents insurance ( thank you obamacare ) but their company has been fighting us tooth and nail . 
  yes gun violence here sucks . 
  most people look at me like i 'm crazy when i point out that western europe has few guns and tight laws and almost negligible gun crime . 
  i live near chicago and last year * in our city alone * more people were murdered ( counting just firearms ) than u.s. troops killed in the middle east . 
  i visited quebec for a week , montreal was a lovely city and the people were indeed very friendly ( those french-canadian girls were n't bad to look at either ) . 
  i really liked canada because ( this is just my opinion ) it seems to combine the best of both the u.s. and europe . 
  i went to bavaria ( munich mainly ) on a university trip . 
  we also spent a few days in austria and a few days in switzerland . 
  we spent about two hours in liechtenstein as well . 
  i 'm not sure if i could do that ... 
  i do n't have insurance here and ca n't afford it . 
  i did visit canada over the summer it was * glorious * . 
  i 've visited europe before as well , only for two weeks though . 
  i did enjoy myself immensely though and ca n't wait to return !, 
  i was kind of losing my shit as well ... 
  i 'm definitely in the minority here in the states though ... 
  i 'm studying in germany next year ( i 'm studying german/international business at university ) , perhaps i may just stay in europe ... edit : if you 'll have me of course , 
  yes , because i 'm sure the likes of britain , france and germany would be unable to handle the likes of them . 
  russia exports more goods to the eu than any other area . 
  they also import more goods from the eu than any other area . 
  it would be like us invading canada or mexico . 
  not going to happen . 
  also , it is 2013 not fucking 1983 . 
  welcome to the 21st fucking century . 
  the united states is not the world 's police . 
  they do n't want us to be and we should n't want to be . 
  we have plenty of problems * here * . 
  all of this is also assuming that in the event of war the u.s. would stand by and go `` nope '' while europe is at war with an outside threat . 
  that most likely would not happen . 
  as an american i would just like to let you know that not all of us are retarded warmongers . 
  keep doing you europe , you 're awesome . 
  what exactly do they need to defend themselves from ? 
  if you have n't noticed , europe does n't have as many enemies as we do because they ** mind their own fucking business ** . 
  their current military capabilities are more than enough for their current needs . 
  personally , i think we need to curtail our military spending ( which is insane ) , and greatly expand our diplomatic efforts . 
  we are * not * loved around the world and not without reason . 
  we ca n't take on the whole world and we should n't seek to . 
  what do you do ? 
  personally new years is n't that big of a deal to me . 
  absolutely , what those idiots do n't understand is that the `` amendments '' to the constitution are just that * changes * . 
  i agree , silly me for wanting frivolous things like healthcare , housing and an education . 
  especially when that means billionaires can only have 7 vacation homes instead of 9 , oh the humanity !, 
  i think their approval rating is at about 15 % at the moment ... 
  watch the new years ball drop in new york . 
  lots of alcohol and fireworks . 
  the ban was lifted in 2011 . 
  it 's still socially taboo though . 
  see my edit . 
  see my edit . 
  so his qualifications on sex and marriage are ... what ? 
  considering he 's not allowed to do either . 
  i 'm not sure how to feel about this . 
  damn straight . 
  god damn it ... 
  this past election we had a vote on gmos . 
  not to ban them but to require them to be labeled . 
  it failed . 
  i guess in the `` land of the free '' ( bullshit ) we do n't have the right to know what we 're eating . 
  for what it 's worth , i 'm sorry . 
  i was n't even born when she was around and i still do n't like her . 
  i have n't been forced to go for a few years now . 
  i still have n't come out to my parents that i 'm atheist though . 
  i 'm waiting until i 'm financially able to take care of myself . 
  i do n't think they would disown me because i like to think my parents are open minded , but better safe than sorry . 
  i would have to drop out of college and i doubt i would be able to pay off my school loans .
