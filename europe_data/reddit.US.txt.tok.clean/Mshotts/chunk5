  it 's as if you people go out of your way to get offended . 
  bottom line is if ukraine or georgia or whoever the fuck else wants to join nato that is their decision not russia 's , us , germany , britain , etc. 
  it seems europeans could learn from the us there 's a difference between psychotic warmongering and refusing to back down to some jumped up little shit who thinks he runs a superpower . 
  it 's also ironic , you say we need to learn from you how to avoid war after you finish telling me we have n't had one on our soil in 150 years . 
  seems like we 're doing it a bit better than you . 
  no , but we know of war . 
  please enlighten me on all these battlefields that have ravaged europe sometime more recently than 70 years ago . 
  more people are shot in chicago in a good weekend than most of your countries in a year . 
  i 'm not arguing that our infrastructure and cities have been mostly unscathed throughout our history but this little narrative you lot are trying to put forward of big evil amerikkkans not understanding the consequences of war while all you europeans who were just plain devastated by it ( which is perfectly true if you ignore that almost nobody who saw it firsthand is even alive today ) and are thus perfect little enlightened pacifists who carry the wounds of ww2 to this day is just plain bullshit . 
  too bad they 're not so enlightened they do n't allow themselves to get riled up by 6 year old bushisms and shit mccain says , a guy who 's been warhawking since before our parents were born . 
  lmfao 50,000 american combat vets will be sleeping our streets tonight ( [ source ] ( http://nchv.org/index.php/news/media/background_and_statistics/ ) ) , they shoot themselves at a rate of something like 15 + per day . 
  how often did you have to wake up your father with a broomhandle so he did n't flail out at you because of his ptsd ? 
  how often did you see your uncle lose his shit in a public place because a screaming child set off his ptsd ? 
  how many of your friends and cousins have had their brains scrambled from ptsd and ieds ? 
  how many of your loved ones have lost limbs or otherwise been seriously wounded and then had to deal with the va trying to fuck them at every possible turn ? 
  how many times have you seen your father curled in a ball on the floor screaming `` where 's my rifle !?! '', 
  while independence day fireworks are shaking the house ? 
  a loved one who never came home ? 
  we know nothing of war ? 
  we 've been at it almost nonstop since i was a child , a lull in the action then the gulf war , vietnam , korea ... what do 95 % of europeans know of war other than the stories their grandparents told them , a few bombed out buildings that are more tourist attraction than memorandum and a censored ( ca n't have too much blood now or the europeans may faint ! ), 
  version of call of duty ? 
  sales tax ? 
  statue of liberty is on its own island . 
  maybe has something to do with how it looks in pictures . 
  i have n't seen either in person though so i could n't tell you . 
  my german may be a bit rusty , but `` taxland '' ? 
  that does n't make any sense to me , the swiss taxes are by far the worst i 've ever seen in any foreign country . 
  mines are great for land denial if that 's what your goal is . 
  minefields need to be cleared which takes time and slows down invaders . 
  they can also be used to destroy infrastructure like rail , bridges , power lines , etc. 
  it 's relevant because it 's important to remember that although the housing prices are cheap relative to other markets it 's still not easy to own a home and homeownership rates are on the decline . 
  how is it unrelated ? 
  when you have extra costs because things are n't covered by a social safety net it 's harder to save up for a down payment on a home as well as harder to keep up with mortgage payments . 
  250,000 may not sound like much compared to other housing markets but it 's still a serious investment for most anyone and you 're talking about a 20/30 ( or more ) year mortgage . 
  especially because wages in these places usually are n't great unless you 're in certain fields . 
  i would much rather be poor in western/central europe than most anywhere in the us, 
  it is cheap but it means you have to live in the midwest . 
  lots of people are okay with that though . 
  you have to keep in mind location , these are midwestern house prices . 
  everyone with money wants to live on the coasts . 
  jesus i could find a 5,000 + sq foot house on a large amount of property for that where i live . 
  median price for a 2-3 ,000 sq ft. house round here is about 250,000 on a half acre lot . 
  many more men have fought and died for far less worthy causes than this . 
  she was tweeting pictures of her getting * fucked * !? 
  lol they say the same shit about a lot of americans as soon as they start questioning the state too much . 
  that 's not a 2/3 majority so not in the united states it would n't if put to popular vote . 
  like i said before i 'm not contesting the fact that there was support . 
  you said `` not that unpopular '' . 
  i would say 50/50 60/40 opinion splits indicate there were a lot of people with whom it * was * unpopular . 
  in your opinion 50/50 60/40 splits do not indicate controversy ? 
  hell even at the time of highest support less than a year later those numbers plummeted . 
  i 'm not trying to say there was n't support , because there was , but to paint this picture that everyone just rolled along with the invasion when it happened is just plain false . 
  that 's somewhat misleading . 
  i think any other issue with those kind of wildly fluctuating approval figures would get the label `` controversial '' to say the least . 
  the start of the iraq war saw the largest anti-war protests in american history including the entire vietnam era . 
  last i counted there are about 5 nato members that spend their 2 % and two of those are the us and turkey . 
  hell half of nato has n't met their requirements in decades . 
  my grandfather fought in the pacific from ' 42 - '45 with the marines and once told me how the japanese would do this sort of thing all the time . 
  he said that eventually they just kept shooting . 
  is it hard to get access to non russian tv/web/radio / etc or is it just what people watch ? 
  there are only ~ 5 nato countries that spend their 2 % on defense in the first place . 
  everyone has been enjoying our free ride since 1945 . 
  fuck that . 
  the rest of nato is n't going to do shit . 
  the ukrainians are on their own as we 're the only ones with enough balls to even give them supplies and advice and are probably the most likely to give them arms if it comes down to it . 
  we have probably done more for ukraine than any other nato member . 
  we have been supplying their troops with literally everything short of arms and munitions and have military advisers there as we speak . 
  no , the treaty you are referring to quite explicitly states that the uk , usa and russia will * respect * the borders of ukraine . 
  the obligations under the 1994 budapest memorandum are as follows : the uk , usa & russia agree to : respect ukrainian independence and sovereignty within its existing borders . 
  refrain from the threat or use of force against ukraine . 
  refrain from using economic pressure on ukraine in order to influence its politics . 
  seek united nations security council action if nuclear weapons are used against ukraine . 
  refrain from the use of nuclear arms against ukraine . 
  consult with one another if questions arise regarding these commitments . 
  as a country we have massive cold-war ruskie killing blue balls . 
  we 're a little hot and bothered with all this talk of war and russians at the moment . 
  why is a missile ** defense ** system considered provocative ? 
  if the poles were building this themselves instead of the us would you feel the same ? 
  russia is a big boy country capable of making their own choices and they certainly have to say the least . 
  it is the right of sovereign nations to govern within their own borders as they see fit . 
  if poland and the baltics want a missile defense system that is their business not russia or putins . 
  as a socialist how do you defend putin 's russia ? 
  russia is not socialist and it 's not even close . 
  the history is there sure but russia in 2014 is about as socialist as the usa in 2014 . 
  i keep seeing leftists defend putin simply because it means being against the usa . 
  i would say that socialists should define themselves by their ** own ** beliefs and not simply a desire to oppose someone ( though i understand conflict with capitalists ) . 
  i would also remind you that there are american socialists as well , the world is not black and white ^ comrade, 
  tbf that treaty says that the borders of ukraine will be respected by the us , uk & russia . 
  us & uk have respected ukrainian borders , russia has not . 
  the treaty goes on to say any act of aggression by a nuclear power ( russia is most certainly a nuclear power ) will be brought before the un ( it has ) and efforts will be made to support ukraine if they are economically coerced ( they have been and they have been receiving aid ) . 
  i 'm not trying to be argumentative . 
  simply stating that there 's more to military ( hard ) power than adding a few zeros on budget sheets for a couple years . 
  dodging the point . 
  i posted this above but only 5 nato members even spend their 2 % and 2 of those are n't in the eu . . 
  nato members spending less than 2 % of gdp on defense ( as of 2012 ) ( per nato guidelines ) : iceland , luxembourg , lithuania , spain , hungary , latvia , belgium , czech republic , slovakia , canada , netherlands , romania , slovenia , denmark , germany , italy , albania , croatia , norway , portugal , bulgaria , estonia and poland . 
  member states spending at 2 % or above ( as of 2012 ) : greece ( 2.1 % ) , france ( 2.3 % ) , turkey ( 2.3 % ) , uk ( 2.5 % ) , usa ( 4.8 % ) i keep seeing this sentiment throughout the thread of distancing europe from the us , leaving nato , `` standing on our own feet '' , etc. 
  yet actions speak louder than words and fact is most of europe has neglected their military forces for decades . 
  fact is supporting yourself militarily costs money and is n't achievable overnight and almost all of nato has been perfectly happy to laugh off preparedness for decades due to the umbrella protection of our alliance . 
  i keep seeing talk of a european or eu alliance thrown around . 
  who is going to pay for that and who is going to supply the troops/munitions if it becomes necessary to use it ?
