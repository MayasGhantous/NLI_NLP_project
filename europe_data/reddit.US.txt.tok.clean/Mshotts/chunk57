  ha if there 's anywhere in the country you can find good italian it 's nyc . 
  you lucked out . 
  some places you 're lucky to have an olive garden . 
  roos was decent but nothing special . 
  you do n't last that long in the nfl by being total shit hah . 
  hunt has the size and athleticism but he 's a newcomer and at a disadvantage from late starting age . 
  he was a beast in college though . 
  he could be solid but he 's already 27 and has * maybe * a 5 year window . 
  assumed no injuries which you ca n't assume . 
  not bad though for such a small country !, 
  i 'm sure my memory is just fucked or something but i could have ** sworn ** they were flying ** eu ** flags on the barricades of the maidan , * not * american ones . 
  not gon na hold my breath if / r/europe is any indication . 
  any italian food joints you recommend in your area ? 
  wow that is absurd . 
  i 'm usually around 1 mbps sometimes lower sometimes higher but never more than 5mbps and that 's only if i 'm home alone at like lunch . 
  which would be even more ridiculous because they would for some reason have to take the ball ~ 100 yards to their own endzone first . 
  that 's a very good graphic that usually gets passed around during the super bowl but even that is still essentially basics without even really touching strategy . 
  has n't been a safety on a 2pat since 1940 if you 're only talking about professional . 
  in terms of awesomeness it would be worth more than a point but it 's not on the scoreboard . 
  more than anything it 's a relic of how the game was played way back when it would have been more common ( though still very relatively rare ) and there 's not really a need to change the rules . 
  it 's more obscure trivia than anything . 
  if this ever happened now the officials would almost certainly halt the game and review the play . 
  okay ? 
  perhaps , but `` few '' is relative . 
  kicking is an integral part of the game and kickers have won championships . 
  just every game . 
  how ? 
  it does n't bother me at all that 1 ) people like soccer 2 ) americans like soccer 3 ) america lost the game 4 ) other people are better than the us at plenty of stuff including soccer . 
  the only place i 'm drawing the line is me calling it football . 
  i do n't care what other people call it . 
  but yeah -30 pts just for saying i did n't even know about the game is totally me being all butthurt about ... something ... 
  a line i 've heard a million times in regards to our football `` they do n't even use their feet !!! 1 ! '', 
  it 's a joke . 
  the level of butthurt and inferiority complex in this thread is unreal . 
  there are a couple germans and brits that i 'm aware of as well . 
  you need 53 for a team though . 
  technically 45 but i doubt they could field a full team let alone a competitive one . 
  i think you 're thinking of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_roos & http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/margus_hunt . 
  those are the two estonians i know . 
  roos came to the us early enough that he does n't even speak estonian though . 
  do they even use their feet ? 
  yes but one has n't happened since 1940 . 
  lol . 
  yes your football . 
  if it was ours it would be 162-0, 
  forgot the game you mean . 
  first i 've heard of it . 
  nfl draft is around the corner ffs . 
  people get pissy when you ruin their genocides . 
  because it would start ww3 ? 
  so what you 're saying is a circlejerk is okay so long as at is n't an american backed circlejerk . 
  good to know . 
  have a good one . 
  alright fair enough . 
  we could have saved each other a whole lot of time if you had simply said i have no interest in having a conversation but only getting offended about the way you say things . 
  peace out . 
  you sure did a good job explaining what your viewpoints are beyond `` you have a point but the way you say it makes me feel bad '' . 
  have a good day . 
  so i 'm insulting you by voicing my opinions ? 
  if your political viewpoints are so fragile that they can not withstand criticism maybe you should reevaluate those viewpoints . 
  i 'm more than willing to hear your disagreements . 
  i 've literally spent this entire time trying to get them out of you and have n't gotten anything . 
  if you 've spent plenty of time discussing it surely it would take no effort on your behalf to either link me to or simply summarize your opinions . 
  you keep saying i 'm the one getting all wound up yet you 're the one that seems to be quite upset right now . 
  all i 'm trying to do is figure out why your hurt feelings trump facts and i have yet to get a satisfactory answer . 
  so you dislike the fact that i have certain interests in regards to us-european relations ? 
  you want me to comment on other threads to validate my opinions ? 
  it 's funny because americans commenting in threads that do n't involve us-european relations usually get thoroughly downvoted and told to gtfo . 
  again , you 're not making any points against what i say but only the manner in which i say it . 
  here i am . 
  just wanting that discussion to take place . 
  with you dodging by saying you dislike my tone . 
  whatever though . 
  like i said , your silence and only commenting on * how * i say things rather than * what * i say speaks volumes . 
  if you do n't like what someone says you attack the way they say it . 
  this makes things clear as day . 
  thank you . 
  okay . 
  what would be an acceptable way for me to voice my opinion that our allies have dropped the ball and invited aggression through weakness then ? 
  or is it not really about the way i voice my opinions and instead what my opinions are ? 
  what is it ? 
  i 'm right but you do n't like the way i say it ? 
  or i 'm wrong and i 'm wrong because i 'm `` whiny '' in the way i express myself ? 
  yep , no discussion . 
  not sure what i expected . 
  nice . gif though . 
  cocky ? 
  so that 's what your issue is ? 
  not that i 'm wrong but that i 'm cocky about it ? 
  what exactly constitutes cocky in your book ? 
  not that i 'm right about europe being fucking irresponsible moneygrubbers for decades and even now refusing to acknowledge that it 's own weakness and indecisiveness is what has invited russian aggression ? 
  fucks sake you seriously think this is about inflating my own ego do n't you ? 
  you seriously think i 'm happy about the state of affairs ? 
  that clarifies everything beautifully though thank you . 
  hurt feelings trump facts every time apparently . 
  you seem to be under the impression that your or my feelings are what matters here . 
  yes i 've made my viewpoints clear . 
  that is that our so called `` allies '' have seriously dropped the fucking ball . 
  thus inviting russian aggression that my country is now on the hook for preventing . 
  what do you want me to say ?
