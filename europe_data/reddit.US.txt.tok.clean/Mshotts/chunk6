  if i were a frenchman or a brit i would be seriously wary of becoming to that force what the us is for nato , the provider of a more or less free ride . 
  i do n't expect this to be a popular sentiment but / r/europe is an echo chamber for idealism far too often . 
  let me preface this by saying i agree with some of the points made in this piece , however the author is neglecting a crucial point and that is the cost of building and maintaining bases . 
  forget nato and forget russia , fact is building a military installation and then staffing and supplying it are big and expensive undertakings . 
  who is going to pay for this ? 
  the united states already has bases all over the world and has been heavily involved in the middle east for well over a decade now . 
  if not us then who ? 
  most nato members that are n't us , uk & france do n't even meet their 2 % nato defense spending guidelines . 
  then there is the question of stationing soldiers there , the us already has tens of thousands of soldiers in europe it really does not make a difference where they are as they can be anywhere on the continent in force within hours . 
  in all honesty i think this is a bit of a kneejerk reaction . 
  imo we should continue to station small numbers of us troops in eastern european countries ( with their blessing ) . 
  if it comes to actual fighting they wo n't do much but in the event of war american blood being spilled will force public opinion and any attack on a nato member will force a us response lest we watch our alliance system and subsequently our hegemony collapse . 
  we would have no choice and the rest of nato would be forced to follow ( though i think everyone would willingly ) . 
  ultimately though that is a short term solution . 
  long term we need to work on training with eastern european forces and ensuring that there is strong cohesion and ability to fight next to each other . 
  this also means helping them to achieve better self sufficiency so that these countries are more capable of defending themselves rather than being so reliant on nato and the mutual defense that provides . 
  not a sexy or flashy solution but ultimately i think it would be more effective for all parties involved rather than simply plopping yet more american bases down . 
  also russia/putin can not as easily protest eastern europe being more militarily capable as they could american bases . 
  you would much rather take the public intoxication . 
  most likely they 'll ignore you but if you do get picked up you 'll probably just be tossed in the drunk tank for the night . 
  duis they do n't fuck around with and you 'll most def end up with thousands in legal fees if not lose your license . 
  you can be cited for public intoxication . 
  99 % of the time you 're fine and thousands do every weekend anyway but it 's certainly not unheard of to be stopped/cited/arrested . 
  hehe , `` bless your heart '' is a passive aggressive way of calling someone a dummy or incompetent . 
  it was a dave chapelle joke . 
  do they have crawfish ? 
  those are good eating . 
  the independent coroner found that his wounds on his arms were consistent with either being shot while his back was to the shooter or his hands were in the air . 
  there 's also the matter of the shot that 's in his fucking forehead . 
  and he was 6 ' 4 '' which i do n't know the metric conversion but it 's pretty damn tall . 
  shoulda sprinkled some crack on him . 
  it 's entirely irrelevant . 
  the ** police chief himself ** has said multiple times that the officer who stopped him did not even know that the robbery had taken place let alone that he was a suspect . 
  america in 2014 , where stealing some gas station swishers is a capital offense . 
  bless your heart . 
  lol like we are n't already armed . 
  but i think you would be surprised how quickly people would snatch them up if it actually happened . 
  factory fresh ak-74 ? 
  yes please !, 
  what a load of shit . 
  tl ; dr : russia and putin are never ever responsible for their own actions because america and nato . 
  tell me herr steingart , were you able to see the original protests that kicked off due to conflict between a ** russian ** backed politician and protestors who wanted closer ** eu ** ties and were flying ** eu ** flags over the barricades on the maidan or did you have your head so far up your `` compromising and re-conciliatory '' german ass that you missed it ? 
  ah iraq and afghanistan again , the end all be all argument when it comes to the actions of russia and putin in 2014 . 
   we should try to avoid the detour via the battle fields in the 21st century . 
  history does not have to repeat itself . 
  maybe we can find a shortcut . 
  clearly this goal is best achieved through a policy of appeasement and sitting on our hands . 
  if only someone had tried that in `` history '' !, 
  wait ... 
  if europe can spy on the us why ca n't we do the same ? 
  and round 'n round in circles we go ... 
  fact is this is a global issue , every ( or close enough to every that you 're arguing semantics ) government does this shit and it should be a major concern to everyone regardless of what passport you have . 
  the us may be the posterboy ( and probably deservedly so ) but we all need to work together towards change and playing the blame game does nothing to help . 
  this tired bs again . 
  why do n't you bring up iraq and afghanistan as well ? 
  at least he has the balls to have a flair so people can attack him ( or her you know the drill ) based on his nationality rather than the content of what he 's saying unlike you . 
  according to the [ royal danish air force wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_danish_air_force#current_aircraft_inventory ) you guys have about 30 total fighers ( f16s ) . 
  so not really . 
  it 's cool though because we have ~ 2300 . 
  it 's the thought that counts . 
  not only that but it 's been like 5 freaking hours . 
  people need to realize that just because this is the internet age not everything is available at the snap of a finger in real life . 
  certainly not in an active conflict zone . 
  getting downvoted for playing devil 's advocate in / r/europe ? 
  impossible !, 
  but yeah i do n't know what i expected . 
  i even said from the start i do n't support it . 
  i never said i support this . 
  i understand your point but my point was n't that it 's right but that it is that way due to popular attitudes . 
  you ate quite right in your comparison but the fact remains that it will not change via bombarding people with a holier than thou stance . 
  my intention was n't to use it as an excuse . 
  what i was trying to get at was their efforts may be more profitable in other areas . 
  capital punishment is on a by state basis . 
  i clearly said i do not support the state carrying out executions . 
  i live in a state with no capital punishment . 
  and i did n't say it was insignificant i said there are far larger human rights issues in the american penal system involving hundreds of thousands if not millions rather than ~ 40 a year . 
  i quite clearly said i do not support executions carried out by the state . 
  but that 's better from a eurocentric view . 
  the point i 'm trying to make is that at best it 's an academic discussion because nothing this thread or amnesty international has come up with is going to remotely interest the people of the states where the death penalty is legal much less convince them it 's morally wrong and want to repeal it . 
  from your perspective . 
  the average american supports the death penalty . 
  if you 're calling it hypocrisy i would ask how that 's so when americans ( in general ) see nothing wrong with the death penalty . 
  i just do n't understand how it 's somehow against the ideals we `` promote '' when that particular ideal is not supported here . 
  in 2010 39 people were executed in the us . 
  we have fewer people on death row in the country than china executes in a year ( that are even known ) and unlike many other countries that execute people we have strict rules on what crimes are capital offenses and restrict the practice to mentally competent adults . 
  you give decent reasons but i would turn around and say it 's because we 're the low hanging fruit on a big fucking tree . 
  i think amnesty international is wasting their time trying to totally eliminate the death penalty in the us when it will most likely not happen in our lifetime , there are countries with far more widespread ( and less humane ) use of the practice and imo there are far bigger human rights issues in the american penal system than the ( relatively ) small number of people executed each year . 
  okay but the death penalty has a very long history here and is supported by a majority of the population . 
  we also have different views on other things that plenty of europeans would want nothing like in their countries . 
  i myself am not a supporter of the state being able to carry out executions but if you think the argument that carrying out such executions makes you backward and uncivilized is going to hold much sway with the voters of the states where it is legal you 're in for a bad time . 
  they do n't give a rats ass what europeans think of them and their penal system . 
  i do n't understand why the us is always the target of these kinds of things . 
  if you want to go after people for executions why not the chinese or saudis who execute far more in a year than we do in a decade . 
  if you think you 're going to end executions in the us by cutting off supplies of the drugs used all you 're going to do is cause states to go back to the firing squad , hanging or the electric chair . 
  every time i see this topic come up here it 's never `` well maybe we should stop executing people '' it 's about other methods that can be used , we 're not exactly squeamish . 
  more power to you i guess . 
  i do n't disagree . 
  how did you get north carolina flair ? 
  it is our mess . 
  we feel somewhat obligated to prevent it from becoming a massacre and from allowing is to set up an extremist state in the me which will be a far bigger problem than anything that 's happened in the me in the past century .
