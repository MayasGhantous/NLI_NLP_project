  i 'll tell them though , they 're in that thread about the eu army jerking themselves off right now because they do n't live in countries bordering russia and have to face the legitimate prospect of a russian offensive being able to take them out in 48 hours . 
  they are the same people that have circlejerked for years about how the eu is more than a match for russia , does n't even need the us . 
  now look where we are and what kinds of discussions we 're having compared to what they were so `` sure '' about two years ago . 
  but look at me just being a warmongering american imperialist bastard who wants to go home . 
  so then why is n't the eu just tripping over themselves in their hurry to send soldiers and supplies of their own ? 
  surely americans are n't even necessary in the face of such awesome eu firepower . 
  the russians are surely quivering in their boots right ? 
  maybe there is but if the eu wants to be treated like a federation and wants to be treated like a single entity when it suits them they do n't get to pull that card when they need our boots on the ground . 
  they want to play superpower , let them take care of their own , let them pay the bills and let them put their blood on the line . 
  if the russians come for alaska we 're sure as shit not going to sit around waiting for belgians and italians down in the lower 48 . 
   letting putin jerk off all over europe is not the answer the very fact that we 're damn near the only thing stopping that from happening is exactly my point . 
  no , it 's not in our interests but neither is american soldiers taking the brunt of a russian offensive to save a bunch of spoiled brat pacifists who just realized that maybe military force is sometimes * gasp * necessary . 
  we 'd be better off letting the russians wear themselves out on them and then show up late having conserved the bulk of our forces like we did in ww1 and ww2 . 
  we 're going to be called imperialist warmongers either way . 
  the eu is picking and choosing the moments they want to take their defense seriously ( i.e. 
  ** after ** americans from the other side of the fucking planet are between them and the threat in their own fucking backyard ) . 
  so why should n't we ? 
  45,000 troops then considering that 's more than all non-uk european forces committed to iraq/afghanistan . 
  that 's how many you get . 
  in support roles of course and naturally we have to make sure there 's peaks and flows . 
  not all 45,000 there at once !, 
  considering our air force alone has over 35,000 personnel stationed in europe ... we should give exactly what we received and nothing more . 
  therefore the eu has nothing to worry about right ? 
  where in nato rules does it say nations can never leave and create new defensive alliance structures ? 
  right next to the part where it says spend 2 % of gdp on defense ? 
  i 've been informed numerous times here those are just `` guidelines '' after all . 
  but since you lot love bringing up iraq/afghanistan so much i 'm sure we can drag our feet before finally showing up half-assed like the vast majority of the eu did . 
  and meanwhile the top post in / r/europe is all about how the eu needs an army . 
  this is a conflict that essentially started over their trade deal . 
  in their backyard . 
  they 'll let us die for them now and then 10 years from now they 'll have their little army and it 'll be back to the old circlejerks over how the eu has no real military threats . 
  fuck that . 
  let them fight their own battles over their trade deal , to protect their union with their army . 
  no more sacrificial american lambs being all that 's standing between the bear they poked and them until they get their shit together . 
  if only someone would have been telling them to do that for fucking years . 
  european bureaucrats acting like spoiled little children now has put americans into the firing line . 
  that could be your father , brother or son losing his life because of the eu having their head up their ass until their `` sudden epiphany '' . 
  american flag draped caskets will be coming home by the boatload because spoiled brat pacifists just somehow did n't realize that military force is sometimes * gasp * necessary until ** after ** americans were between them and the threat in their backyard . 
  bring home every last american boot right now . 
  vote 2016 for whoever will get us out of nato asap . 
  enough of this bullshit . 
  this is exactly why the us needs to leave nato right now . 
  the eu has used us backed nato hard power to advance its own economic interests via that ukraine-eu trade deal . 
  now that we 've stepped up for them to snivel behind our skirts after they picked a fight they will allow american blood to be shed in their name and then one day * poof * eu army and all of a sudden it 's back to `` we do n't need american military protection '' again . 
  that . 
  let them deal with the problems they 've created now . 
  they want to play superpower ? 
  that 's fine but under no circumstances should we now foot their bills or protect them . 
  vote 2016 for whoever will get us out of nato . 
  christ read the damn thing , nowhere does it say the us militarily support ukraine . 
  i 've read the damn thing a dozen times . 
  quote it where it says that , i guarantee you you ca n't because it 's not there . 
  fucking hilarious how we say the same things but mine is destroyed because it has the american flair . 
  exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  we get all the negatives and no rewards . 
  we will not go against our own self interests , especially for a non-nato member . 
  no idea who that is , you can think my views represent some sort of fringe group if that makes you feel better . 
  my opinions are far more mainstream in the us than reddit would have you believe . 
  what exactly do you want me to do or say ? 
  your country is in a shitty situation . 
  but americans were n't the ones who put you there . 
  i say again , and i have yet to be answered by anyone , why not turn to the eu , your so called `` european brothers '' for aid ? 
  if armies were the only thing that mattered the world would be a much different place . 
  it 's more about the principle of them not picking fucking fights with the neighborhood bully . 
  the budapest memorandum says we must respect the borders of ukraine ( we have ) . 
  we must help to economically support ukraine if ukraine is economically coerced ( it has been and we have been ) . 
  we must bring the issue before the un ( we have ) . 
  we are in full compliance with the budapest memorandum . 
  this is the border with nato . 
  but not nato . 
  like i said , why do n't you ask the eu for help ? 
  it was their trade deal that started this after all . 
  if i recall my nation 's history correctly , isolationism is n't always necessarily the wrong decision in times of trouble . 
  but yes the world has evolved and so must the united states . 
  which is why we must look beyond europe now to the east . 
  we must look beyond nato . 
  south korea and japan are more than a match for damn near any european country militarily speaking and they actually take their defense seriously unlike europe . 
  they do n't see us as a free ride like the eu . 
  and most importantly they do n't go picking fights with the neighborhood bully then run and hide behind our skirts . 
  what 's reasonable or moral is not necessarily reality . 
  if this theoretical scenario made the leap to reality ( which i * really * doubt ) , i can almost guarantee you that there would be children younger than 15 engaging in warfare with the invaders . 
  i 'm not trying to be a dick , i 'm sorry if i came off that way . 
  yeah plenty of people stuff their face . 
  but if i 'm spending that much on a meal i 'm just going to go to an actual bar or restaurant . 
  mcdonalds is for when i have 15 minutes or need to eat and drive . 
  good . 
  we should n't be involved . 
  this is n't our fight . 
  this is n't even our fucking continent , sure as shit is n't our neighbor . 
  was n't our trade deal . 
  is n't our supplies of natural gas . 
  is n't our threat . 
  we got all the negatives and none of the positives . 
  the eu wanted the trade deal , ukrainians wanted closer ties . 
  where do we fit into that equation ? 
  we did just fine when the entirety of ukraine was soviet controlled . 
  we will be just fine either way . 
  that may sound cold and harsh and perhaps it is but it 's the reality of the situation . 
  nobody is burning eu flags and chanting death to the eu . 
  we 're the bad guys as always no matter what .
