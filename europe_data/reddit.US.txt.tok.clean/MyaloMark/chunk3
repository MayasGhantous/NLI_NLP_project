  i see the boy 's name `` joao '' is no longer popular . 
  that 's probably a good thing because it was a tough name to decipher until you actually heard it spoken . 
  i knew a few portuguese guys named joao and felt bad for them because their name was always considered comical by american kids who were n't about to pronounce it correctly as `` wah-oh '' , but always as `` wow '' . 
  in the us it 's spelled , [ `` bosco '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=bosco&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=n&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=9akdudxghpsv4apc7odgcg&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=605&amp;sei=-qkdueigd5a54ao5k4cqda#imgrc=fkjig8zdcxqshm%3a%3bkzxvyfzb2ffbym%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fanewscafe.com%252fwp-content%252fuploads%252f2009%252f06%252fboscosyrup.jpg%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fanewscafe.com%252f2009%252f07%252f01%252fdarcie-gore-whatever-happened-to-bosco%252f%3b420%3b315 ) and is sold as a drink mix . 
  winston churchill was said to begin drinking at breakfast and was a well known drunk . 
  avery high functioning drunk though , so no one cared too much . 
  there 's the old story about the dinner party he showed up to , three sheets to the wind . 
  the proper lady he was seated next to finally had enough of his drunken antics and told him , `` sir , you are drunk ! '', 
  to which old `` winnie '' replied , `` madame , tomorrow i will be sober . 
  but you will still be ugly ! '', 
  they wo n't be able to afford the `` 40,000 euro cars and wear nice clothes '' if they work at a pizza joint . 
  is nick squires , the person who wrote this telegraph article , an idiot or a liar ? 
  he has to be one or the other . 
  or possibly both ? 
  if you listen to the news you will never go anywhere . 
  i remember back on 9/11 when i landed in istanbul , my family thought i was going to be kidnapped or something . 
  nothing could have been further from the truth though , as everyone there treated me like a prince once they discovered i was an american . 
  they cried with me that night . 
  i 'll never forget their kindness . 
  so do n't always believe the news . 
  just go . 
  the [ hanseatic league ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanseatic_league ) might qualify :  the hanseatic league ( also known as the hanse or hansa ; low german : hanse , dudesche hanse , latin : hansa , hansa teutonica or liga hanseatica ) was a commercial and defensive confederation of merchant guilds and their market towns that dominated trade along the coast of northern europe . 
  it stretched from the baltic to the north sea and inland during the late middle ages and early modern period ( c. 13th to 17th centuries ) . 
   in america we do n't really call anything a `` village . '', 
  so true , though it was n't always so . 
  i lived in a village in rhode island as a kid . 
  my town had three of them in fact . 
  these villages were all built by the owners of early nineteenth century fabric mills for their employees . 
  only the older citizens like myself still refer to these collections of brick row houses as a village . 
  i do n't think the younger ones still use the term though because it 's so archaic . 
  even * i * thought the word sounded too old world as a kid and as was always embarrassed to admit that i came `` from the village '' , so i ca n't blame them for dropping it . 
  at least it 's not pork . 
  imagine how * that * would go over with customers of certain religious persuasions ? 
  wales actually is n't a part of england , it 's is a separate country . 
  but it * is * part of the united kingdom . 
   this * was * america 's world . 
  ftfy . 
  i do n't understand why archeologists continue to describe every find as a temple . 
  this article continues the tradition even though it clearly states that no one knows what this site was used for . 
  it * does * say that people were n't living there , but what does that prove ? 
  it may have been a seasonal fishing camp . 
  something tells me archeologists must get more grant money for unearthing a ` temple '' than they do for a fish camp . 
  beware eastern germany . 
  you are about to be invaded by all manner of religious nuts attempting to sell you their version of a god that just happens to agree with their own prejudices . 
  i bet this gets stopped . 
  if not , who could blame the people for rising up in riot at the construction site ? 
  the golden dawn is passing out free food to starving greek citizens while spreading their poisonous race hatred . 
  they will just gain more public support if the greek government goes through with this boondoggle . 
  the hundred million could be better utilized . 
  apportioning half to public services and the remaining half to tax relief would serve the country much better than some race track where ticket prices would probably be out of reach of a large sector of the impoverished citizenry . 
  greece should build their race track after their fiscal and economic house is in order and not before . 
  more reason then for a separate subreddit . 
  there 's a danger that the subreddit will become crowded with languages that most americans , i.e. , most redditors , ca n't understand . 
  therefore , i suggest a separate subreddit for foreign language stories . 
  otherwise , the europe subreddit might die because no one wants to sort through the list for articles in english . 
  funny to see this here right after hearing a report on npr regarding this very subject . 
  in this report , they used as an example the pasta company , barilla , which has two plants , one in the north and the other in the south . 
  the northern plant always produces . 
  not so the southern plant . 
  the problem was absenteeism . 
  there were so many slackers taking mondays off , game days off and pretty much any day when the weather was nice that production was hurting . 
  so the company brought in a new director who called out the malingerers and changed the culture there . 
  it turns out the employees were slacking off simply because they figured no one cared . 
  the gist of the report was that barilla 's experience was typical because this slacker attitude is prevalent in the south . 
  the pledge was written by a socialist . 
  i think that might be the socialist salute , adopted by the german national socialists , or nazis . 
  i think the salute was changed in the us early in the war to the familiar hand over heart . 
  that 's how it looks to me . 
  he 's old enough to realize this also . 
  question is , why do so before a world-wide audience ? 
  senility ? 
  ( sorry about that . 
  did n't mean to leave you hanging . ), 
  is this a customary salute in germany ? 
  as an american , i 've only seen such a salute performed by, 
  the turks are surrounded by the worse neighbors in the world . 
  syria , iraq and iran all border the country . 
  then there are tribal groups who want to divide the country . 
  perhaps these groups have a real claim . 
  perhaps they do n't . 
  i do n't know enough about the situation to make a decision on who is right though . 
  all i know is that i have met both turks and kurds in turkey and found them all to be superlative people , always willing to go out of their way to help a traveler . 
  i can only imagine what we americans would do if we found ourselves in the same circumstances as the turks . 
  for instance , suppose a large group of mexicans suddenly decided to drive the non-hispanics from texas and southern california ? 
  this seems pretty much what 's going on in turkey , with the kurds demanding the return of what they historically consider theirs . 
  i just wish more americans would visit the turkey so they could see for themselves that there are no crazy islamists there , only hard working people who do n't deserve the bad rep they have gotten over the years . 
  til there 's a subreddit called propagandaposters . 
  one upvote for you . 
  [ he reminds me of someone ... ] ( http://www.fathersarducci.com/ ), 
  excellent post . 
  i was entertained and i learned something too . 
  this is what i come to reddit for . 
  i 've had an interest in the poetry of some foreign swearing since the seventies when i heard a radio news report about a protest against henry kissinger , somewhere in saudi arabia , iirc . 
  the translation given for the crowd 's chant was , `` knives to kissinger !, 
  in his face ! '', 
  the serbian examples displayed in this blog put that to shame and are to be admired for their creativity . 
  and would most likely get one killed in a place like saudi arabia , now that i think about it . 
  i do n't think the wahabis would get the humor inherent in a statement such as , `` may god fuck you , may he fuck you , god - that 's who , may he fuck you , and may god allow god to fuck you , by god ... '' . 
  that 's fucking brilliant . 
  ok ... now i 've heard everything .
