do the have any other notable players besides anze kopitar ? 
  i 'd guess that them being more popular in the early to mid 2000s than now would be because of their ( then recent ) success . 
  the yankees were already one of the most historic and successful franchises in baseball . 
  after not doing too well in the 80s , they won the world series in 1996 , 1998 , 1999 , 2000 , and also reached the world series in 2001 and 2003 . 
  to answer your rhetorical question , [ king hussein of jordan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hussein_of_jordan ) did . 
  them and the white kids who think they 're black to be cool . 
  sorry , we ca n't do that . 
  how about new jersey instead ? 
  we 'll even through in staten island , so you even technically have part of present day new amsterdam . 
  i think i saw something that most of our apples sit for as much as a year before going to market . 
  i saw something that , pending nhlpa approval , the [ ottawa senators and colorado avalanche will play 2 regular season games in sweden ] ( http://www.tsn.ca/nhl-to-hold-games-in-sweden-china-in-2017-1.661942 ) next year in probably november . 
  also , as a big hockey fan , i feel like i should ask this . 
  how popular is the nhl in sweden , compared to the shl ? 
  what teams are popular there ? 
  sorry for late response as an american , i do n't think there will be increased voting for the socialists ( and i 'm not saying that because i align with the libertarians on many issues ) . 
  it 's in both democrats and republicans best interest to deny exposure for third parties . 
  that 's what keeps them and the two party system in power . 
  they will do everything they can to keep them from getting exposure like denying access to the debates or denying party access in a state . 
  well that in and the winner takes all voting system ( with the exception of maine who will switch to ranked voting in 2018 i believe ) . 
  with the winner take all , it 's easy to say that a vote for [ third party ] is a vote for [ major party you hate the most ] . 
  this makes voting into , vote against your least favorite candidate instead of vote for your favorite candidate . 
  if anyone wants to read about it , [ here it is . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pig_war_ ( 1859 ), 
  i spelt it patrick just because i 'm used to spelling it that way . 
  nielsen i should 've know better . 
  i 've been a lifelong islanders fan and he was one of my favorite players . 
  i even googled his name just to make sure i spelled it right , then it switched two small letters around . 
  finland . 
  miikka kiprusoff was one of my favorite players growing up . 
  patrik laine is going to be a beast for years to come . 
  and also , i hate lundqvist . 
  denmark comes close because of frans nielsen . 
  in 1898 for the spanish-american war , [ yellow journalism ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/yellow_journalism ) probably did a lot to sway the opinion of the average american . 
  in 1941 , [ there was a lot leading up to the attack in pearl harbor . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/events_leading_to_the_attack_on_pearl_harbor ) it definitely seemed that while technically neutral , we supported the allies . 
  i do n't know/remember much when learning about the [ gulf of tonkin incident ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_of_tonkin_incident ) , but the americans fired warning shots at the vietnamese , which i do n't think was reported . 
  i think they said that the views hot first . 
  in 01 and 03 , i think a lot of it was blind patriotism in congress and the population in general , just wanting to get whoever was responsible at any cost , and a [ world police mentality . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/u1mlcpmytpk ) sorry just felt like i had to link it there . 
  the nhl is definitely not about fighting . 
  there are n't really any bench clearing brawls anymore , because the first player to leave the bench will receive an automatic $ 10k fine and a 10 game suspension . 
  second player will receive an automatic $ 5k fine and a 5 game suspension , plus any other penalties they committed on that play . 
  there are also many rules that are trying to phase out fighting from the nhl , especially since the summer of 2011 , when [ derek boogaard ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/derek_boogaard ) , [ rick rypien ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rick_rypien ) , and the then recently retired [ wade belak ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/wade_belak ) , all career enforcers died and i believe that their death 's were linked [ cte ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy ) ( the thing that is driving the concussion issue in the nfl and causing a lot of athletes to die premature deaths , often by suicide ) . 
  besides the 5 minute major for fighting and an extra 2 minutes for instigating , some rules that discourage fighting/impose harsher punishments are ( do n't remember when implemented ) : ca n't remove your helmet ( extra 2 minute unsportmenlike conduct if you do ) , there ca n't be multiple fights going on at one time ( i believe anyone who fights after the original altercation gets a 10 minute game misconduct ) , instigators also receive a 10 minute misconduct ( meaning they 're in the box for 17 minutes as opposed to 7 minutes for the 5 for fighting and 2 for instigating ) , if you instigate twice in a game then you get a game misconduct on top of the fighting and instigating penalty , three fights in a single game gets you a game misconduct and i believe an automatic 1 game suspension , all incoming players since 2012 i believe must wear visors ( discourages fighting , because you have to punch the opposing player 's visor and because you now ca n't take off your helmet ) , a player whose jersey comes of receives a game misconduct , the third man into the fight receives a game misconduct plus other penalties that may have occurred on that play , and this year i believe once a player has 10 fighting majors , he gets an automatic 1 game suspension . 
  three more and i believe it 's an automatic 2 game suspension . 
  i think a `` staged fight , '' where its off the faceoff and not spontaneous is an automated game misconduct , but less sure on that . 
  most teams do n't even employ someone to specifically be an enforcer anymore , but still have someone who has at least some skill , plays physical , and could fight to protect the star if needed . 
  sorry for late response and this extremely long comment . 
  random question , you watch any shl/khl/any other european hockey league in sweden ? 
  the problem with ice hockey is that it 's really expensive . 
  the equipment is expensive , and keeping an ice rink is really expensive especially in an area that does n't get cold enough . 
  hockey is actually becoming popular in non traditional markets though . 
  southern california is becoming a hotbed for hockey . 
  the first overall pick in the 2016 nhl draft , [ auston matthews , ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/auston_matthews ) is a half mexican who grew up in arizona . 
  one of my favorite stories is [ david levin , ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_levin_ ( ice_hockey ) ) who was born in and grew up in israel . 
  started our playing roller hockey and moved in with relatives in the toronto are around age 12 to follow his dream . 
  ended up getting selected 1st overall in the ohl priority draft 3 years later and is now a top prospect for the 2018 nhl draft , missing the cutoff for the 2017 draft by only a few days . 
  [ here 's a good read on him . 
  ] ( http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/juniors/david-levins-long-skate-from-israel-to-sudbury/ ) edit : sorry , i get off track when talking about hockey . 
  they do . 
  i believe they are currently in the iihf ( international ice hockey federation ) division 2 and are in the mid 20s as far as rankings go . 
  they were also in the olympics in 1980 . 
  edit : while fact checking myself , i found out they had a [ professional league . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/eredivisie_ ( ice_hockey ) ), 
  i 've seen that video a while ago . 
  it gets very confusing . 
  love his videos . 
  his hometown i believe is very close to mine . 
  and he 's co prince with the bishop of urgell in spain also , due the president of france being a co prince , that means andorra has an elected monarch , but citizens of another country elect him . 
  i know oddly a lot about andorra for an american that the closest he came to europe was montauk , a town about 80 miles east of him and about 100 miles east of nyc . 
  also , is n't the head of the vatican city an elected monarch , the pope ? 
  this nhl draft class is mostly kids my age , which means i 'm not a kid anymore . 
  i feel that if there is a god , he just wants punish me . 
  i 've been an islanders fan since i was born in ' 99 . 
  we sucked for pretty much all my life that i could remember . 
  and now after two consecutive playoff appearances and making it to the second round for the first time since the 90s , we decide to have all our young guys regress and suck as a team . 
  and of course we decided to do that in a what 's supposed to be a weaker draft , two years after mcdavid/eichel , and the year after matthews/laine . 
  also the 6 years of cappy , have snow as gm , and be tormented by what milbury did years ago . 
  i 'm also a big calgary flames fan too for some reason ( do n't ask why , because i 'm not too sure how that happened ) . 
  and i get to watch edmonton get gifted all those first overall picks , including mcdavid , and then get gifted puljujarvi at number 4 . 
  and while i hate the rangers , i have to give them credit . 
  they seem to sell their farm and still seem to draft well later . 
  and still be contenders year after year . 
  now giants , please do n't lose to cleveland . 
  you 're my only hope left sports wise until the mets find a new way to disappoint me . 
  sorry for this rant , that was built up and got a bit out of control . 
  i 'm on li too !, 
  about 20 minutes from ronkonkoma . 
  there was a video by the islanders after the 2014 draft in which asked their some of their picks/prospects to try to pronounce long island town names . 
  they butchered most of them . 
  i 'll try to find it . 
  edit : [ here it is . 
  ] ( http://www.lighthousehockey.com/2014/7/13/5894865/new-york-islanders-news-prospect-mini-camp-comes-to-an-end ), 
  those two and fertility , pennsylvania . 
  as it turns out , fertility is only like 8 miles away from intercouse . 
  damn the pennsylvania dutch country has some weird names . 
  the english might 've taken new york from you guys , but you sure left your town names in the ny area . 
  not cool , man . 
  the us has a lot of awesome town names !, 
  bird in hand , intercouse ( both down the road in amish country of pennsylvania ) , and king of prussia ( also in pennsylvania ) come to mind .
