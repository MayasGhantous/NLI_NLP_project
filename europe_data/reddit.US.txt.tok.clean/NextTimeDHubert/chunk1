if you want a free trade agreement with the united states you need to join the united states afaic . 
   only a few good countries existed back then - like my own `` my own anonymous country that is completely without blame for anything . 
  trust me guys . '', 
   leadership or dominance , especially by one country or social group over others . 
  the second part of my comment had nothing to do with hegemony . 
  it 's a pretty uncommon word for me though . 
  it 's almost exclusively used by radical leftists and north korean dictators in my experience . 
  well for starters , if there was american hegemony would n't it be more likely that sa would buy american ships ? 
  or that spain 's lack of military leads to the global instability ? 
  spain just sold fucking saudi arabia more military hardware than they bother to buy for themselves and we still get the american hegemony speech from this guy . 
  revolutions start small . 
   your argument is based upon a fallacy and mythology , it is pointless to discuss it if you deny the basic reality of geo-politics and modern history , the us has never been a benevolent force in any time in its history . 
  where did i argue that america was a benevolent force ? 
  my argument is we 're wasting money defending you , by default that is benevolent . 
  i do n't particularly care how it is characterized . 
   you rant about socialism but i can only laugh , where i live the roads are perfect , infrastructure is amazing , getting ill does n't mean bankruptcy , i do n't have to beg friends or family , or the internet , if i need a operation , there are no detroit 's , i can drink the water out of the tap without fear of lead poisoning , oh , where i live we have aircraft carriers , foreign bases and stealth bombers . 
  but we just voted to change a lot of that . 
   you speak of the cold war , perhaps learn some history and look at all the military dictatorships in europe that the us propped up in countries from spain to greece to turkey during that cold war . 
  and we did that because dictatorship is awesome , right ? 
  i mean it had nothing to do with an overall strategy of the defense of europe , of which i assume you were a direct beneficiary ( alas i am only an indirect beneficiary . 
  america would have been fine the soviet union took over every goddamn country in the world . ), 
  those nukes you whine about will now most likely be built ( and paid for ! ), 
  by europe . 
  the oil wars you whine about put money in ** your ** pocket , not just mine . 
  once again you ignore my arguments to post your ignorant leftist screed . 
  good luck with your socialist utopia now that you have to pay your own way . 
  yep there it is . 
  we 're there because of the cold war and the lack of backbone ( until now ) to change the status quo . 
  explain what we get that you do n't . 
  explain what we 're losing with trump . 
  we do n't even get your respect or goodwill out of this arrangement . 
  just smugness over our misplaced priorities and barbarism . 
  why should nato ( read - america ) be a reliable ally when we pay for everything ? 
  every time i bring this up , europeans talk about all the `` clout '' and `` control '' america gets ( and bases that we use to protect other countries that do n't chip in ) . 
  to these people , explain these : https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2015/03/17/dividing-the-west-chinas-new-investment-bank-and-americas-diplomatic-failure/ https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0003.html america has gotten shafted for decades and it 's time you guys admitted it . 
   say thanks to de gaulle . 
  he predicted that both the usa and the uk were not reliabl yeah it 's only been 70 years , during which time europe 's military spending has dropped to token levels . 
  how prescient of him !, 
   yes they are . 
  source is nato . 
  does it include air transport , aircraft carriers , satellite intelligence , or the deterrent provided by american nukes and non-deployed strength ? 
  that 's because we were obligated to defend the rest of your continent and because it was a stab in the back . 
  i also must demand that the official language of the miltary be french , and that it 's headquarters will be in paris . 
  europe does n't use oil ? 
  you do n't think europe benefited from the gulf war ? 
  lol . 
  iraq is what happens when all the military power in the world is concentrated in one man 's hands . 
  you guy 's are n't responsible though because you 're just america 's lackeys though , right ? 
  jfc you people are insufferably entitled . 
  you know i 'm critical of the eu not ponying up for it 's military , but to be honest there 's no way they could have with america enabling it . 
  i think you 're right , this is the tough love you guys need . 
  world security should have been a partnership . 
  lol you have usa and uk as allies because you do n't want to pay for armies . 
  man i bet google 's algorithm is going to make germany look bad by linking to angry comments about this . 
  `` get out of estonia or we 're going to nuke you ! '', 
   europe does not have global geopolitical interest and europe should not have to pay for defending the us 's interest . 
  much of that geopolitical interest was securing access to resources used just as much by europe as america . 
  europe 's abdication of responsibility for global security is the root cause of the iraq war . 
  countries elect bad leaders , ours just happened to be in control of nato . 
   this will strengthen chinas position , which is the biggest threat to us dominance . 
  i do n't feel a need for us dominance personally . 
  access to america 's market should allow us to negotiate favorable trade deals , all this influence and dominance is used for the benefit of other countries as far as i can tell . 
  sounds like how europeans want to be in nato without paying for it . 
   we have no enemies or threats , and no reason to give a shit about the sort of `` defense '' you talk about over literally anything else in our society . 
  did you have a followup answer or something ? 
  i love how you have no shame at all about this position . 
  ireland benefits from global peace and stability as much as any nation in the world and contributes jack shit to it . 
  you 're a * member * of the eu and you still feel no responsibility to it . 
  free rider . 
  oh my bad . 
  it 's the conscience of ireland , setting an example for the rest of the world that violence is not the answer . 
  something like that ? 
  how fortunate that your beliefs save you tons of money . 
  and all while you undercut the tax rates of countries that do spend on their ( and your ) defense . 
  neutral = free rider . 
  they 'll lose that if an eu army is formed . 
  i would hope . 
  that should highlight how a wrecking ball should be taken to nato . 
  you have these eu countries who are `` neutral '' and paying virtually nothing for it 's defense . 
  i 'm guessing it would be harder to escape the 2 % guideline when everyone is forced to chip in . 
  it 's like of oklahoma decided it did n't need to pay for america 's military because texas would be the first ones to go in an invasion . 
  suppose the russian economy was on the verge of collapse , and putin has skeletons in his closet that would cause him to be executed if he lost power . 
  you think he would n't start a war to save his ass ? 
  the irish sure hope so . 
  could you imagine them having to chip in for eu military expenses ? 
  in what scenario would france 's nukes matter ? 
   `` i would just also remind us all of the fact that we are meeting here in turkey four shorts months after the failed coup attempt , '' nato secretary - general jens stoltenberg told the 62nd session of the alliance 's parliamentary assembly . 
  this should be a sober reminder to us all , a reminder that democracy and freedom can not be taken for granted , he added . '', 
  i hope he meant that ironically . 
   but while we are in it i do n't see us abandoning allies , especially eu members . 
  you abandoned them a long time ago via your spending priorities . 
  this is another example of the power and control america gets by paying for europe 's defense . 
  rather than spending this money on nato they build a redundant gps . 
  if europe built a few super carriers america would almost certainly decommission some it 's own . 
  this is just one example . 
  american leaders asked europeans to meet the 2 % target because america hates power ? 
  and now it 's 1.1 . 
  the electoral college was a compromise necessary to bring the united states into existence . 
  ** that ** was good governance . 
  most of the problems america has relate to the `` melting pot '' being a failed concept .
