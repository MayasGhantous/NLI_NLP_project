i looked at it , and it seems stalin killed people for giving him bad census numbers . 
  so basically none of it could be trusted . 
  yes , and stalin ruled from 1924-1953 . 
  the 50 million estimate does n't include war time deaths . 
  he was one of the worst dictators in human history . 
  seriously go look it up . 
   `` i have literally no good arguments against that , or evidence to back up my own claims . 
  let me point out you used differnet numbers from [ estimates of how many russian people stalin killed ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/how-many-people-did-joseph-stalin-kill-1111789 ) '' - / u/alexdub88, 
   there 's still no evidence publicly known that it was a russian submarine . 
  from the wiki :  a large military operation is launched to search for an allegedly damaged submarine in kanholmsfj\u00e4rden in the stockholm archipelago . 
  encrypted transmissions sent on an emergency radio frequency used by russian units were recorded . 
  the sources of the transmissions were identified as a submarine and a military site in the kaliningrad region . ( ... 
  ) there were also suggestions that the russian oil-tanker ns concord was involved as a mother-ship for smaller underwater vehicles as it maintained a pattern of criss-crossing outside stockholm during the investigation . 
  a russian research ship equipped with a submarine holding bay , r/v professor logachev , was also in the area and turned off its location transponder . 
  ( ... ) paul schwartz at center for strategic and international studies , csis , said the photograph could be a russian lada-class submarine so wrong . 
  there is plenty of evidence . 
   the same can be said for the us then . 
  yet the us has meddled in the swedish democratic process and laws several times . 
  both russia and the us are to be regarded as hostile nations . 
  any proof of that ? 
  all i could find is they didnt like the vietnam war , so we pulled our ambassador twice over three years starting in 1968 . 
   the us did several incursions in the 80 's against sweden , which was believed to be an attempt to drive us towards becoming a nato member . 
  according to the only source on that i could find :  following the stranding of a soviet whiskey-class submarine in 1981 on the swedish archipelago , a series of massive submarine intrusions took place within swedish waters . 
  however , the evidence for these appears to have been manipulated or simply invented . 
  classified documents and interviews point to covert western , rather than soviet activity . 
  this is backed up by former us secretary of defense caspar weinberger , who stated that western `` testing '' operations were carried out regularly in swedish waters with ** swedish cooperation ** . 
  royal navy submarine captains have also admitted to top-secret operations . 
   the track record of human rights violations by the us-uk axis is only matched by russia and the ussr , so whatever moral high ground you think you may have - you do n't . 
  can you remind me when the us/uk killed 60 million of its own citizens ? 
  really . 
  i went full retard . 
  when you , criticized other countries human rights record , while the country you are defending is * actively arming and supporting a rebellion in a country it just stole a large section of land from * .

  [ you ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/how-many-people-did-joseph-stalin-kill-1111789 ) ? 
   if a country got encircled by the enemy 's missile shield and lost its nuclear strike capability as a result , so its not defensive because it stops the other country from being offensive ? 
  and how would one encircle russia ? 
  have you seen the north , there is n't anything stopping missiles going north or east of russia . 
  or from the nuclear subs from launching . 
  and we dont need mad any more , no one ( save apparently russia ) is going to nuke anyone as anything but a last resort . 
  so not only is your statement not true , but its irrelevant regardless . 
   have they tried to annex sweeden or in any way threaten their national sovereignty ? 
  sweden should be a neutral country , as to not be a threat to any party . 
  yes first they sent a sub into their waters with in the last year , and now they threaten them if they join nato . 
   i was referring to the missiles in turkey that the us had , which started the whole thing . 
  did it ? 
   the soviet union put missiles in cuba for two primary reasons : ( 1 ) to boost the soviet union 's power , threatening the u.s. with nuclear attack from the caribbean and ( 2 ) to ** bolster the soviet union 's bargaining position in its attempts to force west berlin to join east germany ** . 
  additional reasons included defending cuba from american invasion and bolstering soviet prestige . 
   russia has a say in what happens close to their borders , and if sweden becomes nato , their borders become threatened by nato , which is reducing their sphere of influence , ** they have less control of their surroundings ** . . nato , on the other hand , can reach further east , so has their sphere of influence increased . 
  they have no control over sweden , nor any right to . 
  finland is the same . 
  they can talk to those countries and work things out , but saying `` if you join nato ` bad things ' might happen to you '' is not 21st century politics . 
  also maybe if russia did n't invade two of its neighbors in the last 8 years then sweden would have no need to join nato . 
   good fucking job on the human rights , dipshit . 
  as always . 
  kills 50 million of their own people , complains about thousands of deaths , when saving millions . 
   they serve the same purpose , to weaken the power and influence of the opposing state . 
  not true , the only way defense would weaken another county is if that other country already had plans to attack them . 
  2011 was the un , which nato participated in . 
  but i could see how russia would be worried about the un helping forcibly remove a dictator that denied his people human rights . 
   not exactly but yes . 
  now imagine nato troops and missiles positioned in sweden ? 
  go back and check , russia 's nukes were already in cuba at the time of the crisis , they were trying to get more in there . 
   it 's relatively close to their borders so they have to respect them . 
  lol , but russia does n't have to respect sweden , gotcha . 
   but is not affiliated with nato , and being affiliated with nato means more than just training operations . 
  ok but you did n't argue that , you said that it would increase nato 's soi , and decrease russia 's , which is n't true . 
  so what you are saying is that russia , whats the ability to nuke other countries . 
  and if those countries try to stop russia from nukeing them , russia has a right to threaten them ? 
  there is a huge difference between self-defense , and offense . 
  if nato was putting in ** offensive weapons ** into countries right next to russia , that is one thing , but if they put in ** defensive measures ** that 's 100 % different . 
  every country has a right to self defense , no one has the right to attack independent countries with out being provoked . 
  and does n't russia have mobile nuclear missile subs ? 
  those would still be able to launch missiles no problem . 
  ok so invading and claiming land from a neighbor is what , good ? 
  1 , yes i am aware of the cuban missile crisis . 
  that was very different from sweden asking to join nato . 
  russia put nukes in cuba , and was trying to put more in , so we stopped them . 
  sweden is n't in russia 's `` sphere of influence '' , so russia 's soi isnt shrinking , and nato already has a very close relationship with sweden ( they have combined military training operations ) , so nato 's isnt really growing . 
   does your alarm bomb your neighbors every once in a while ? 
  nato 's last bombing was in 1999 , russia is currently doing it now . 
  so not letting russia invade other countries is fucking them over ?

  yeah , but make sure it 's winter first , russians hibernate so that 's the best time to attack them . 
   but we 've got your back in case russia does invade you guys . 
  or before !,

  stop me if you 've heard this one before . 
  man im glad that doesnt apply the to us . 
  me too , thats why i checked it out . 
  honestly i was a bit disappointed . 
  well considering the thing was a play , and not based on any real history i imagine she did n't care much . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marostica  after the second world war , the ** comedy writer mario mirko vucetich authored a play ** in which `` two noblemen , rinaldo d'angarano and vieri da vallanora , fell in love with the beautiful lionora , daughter of the local lord , taddeo parisio . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marostica  after the second world war , the comedy writer ** mario mirko vucetich authored a play ** in which `` two noblemen , rinaldo d'angarano and vieri da vallanora , fell in love with the beautiful lionora , daughter of the local lord , taddeo parisio . 
  as was the custom at that time , they challenged each other to a duel to win the hand of lionora . 
  the lord of marostica , not wanting to make an enemy of either suitor or lose them in a duel , forbade the encounter . 
  instead he decreed that the two rivals would play a chess game , and the winner would have the hand of lionora . 
  the loser of the chess game would also join the family , through marrying her younger sister , oldrada . 
  during the play the game takes place on the square in front of the lower castle with supporters carrying the noble ensigns of whites and blacks , in the presence of the lord , his noble daughter , the lords of angarano and vallonara , the court and the entire town population .
