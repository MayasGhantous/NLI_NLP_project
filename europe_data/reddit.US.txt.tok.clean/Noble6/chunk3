  that is the problem . 
  he is polarizing even among republicans . 
  i do agree it 's possible he 'll run as an independent , but all that would accomplish is splitting the republican vote and ensuring neither trump nor the republican candidate get elected . 
  republican voters . 
  http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/2016-presidential-swing-state-polls/release-detail?releaseid=2271 when asked who they would vote for , a large percentage of republicans said they would support trump . 
  however , trump also had the largest percentage of republicans saying they would not support him for the nomination . 
  he 's very polarizing , so i think he has no shot at convincing moderate voters to vote for him . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/22/donald-trump-wont-win-republican-presidential-nomination ) also has a good discussion of trump and why ( hopefully imo ) he probably wo n't get the nomination . 
  he 's also the most disliked by a huge margin . 
  it can mean beloved or superior based on context . 
   people in `` decided '' states but supporting the minority party in that state would be more likely to go out and vote , people in swing states would feel less obliged to vote , since their state is no longer solely deciding who wins the election . 
  the campaigns themselves also would have been run very differently . 
  perhaps their platforms would be different as well . 
  yeah i actually speak german daily and have a certificate in it . 
  still room to improve though . 
  well time to grind out the last couple years of my phd and move to germany . 
  see you all soon . 
  associated press just called pennsylvania for trump . 
  it 's over . 
  many states voted for that . 
  but there is not much overlap between them and the death penalty states . 
  the gains from that have been a pretty good consolation for me tbh, 
   but the salty bernie bros are just immature children who ca n't deal with reality of politics this whole thing might be worth it if it can help the democratic party get its soul back . 
  not holding my breath though . 
  i ca n't handle it .

  #wrong !, 
  but drebutis if you vote for anyone other than hillary clinton you are basically voting for trump !, 
  i ca n't believe you 'd do this !, 
  i obviously do n't agree with that statement but this is a popular sentiment here .

  puerto rico competes as a separare entity in the olympics and the world cup , but you do n't see that being used a case for independence . 
  they have a choice between independence and statehood , but it will take a referendum granted and recognized by congress in order to mean anything . 
  it is more efficient to heat it in a power plant and then distribute it like that versus having a bunch of small furnaces or generators .

  it was very stressful for him as well . 
  in the moment i had a lot of hatred for him but now i understand that he was just a guy like me trying to get home to his family . 
  he and i do n't keep in touch though . 
  talking to him just brings up too many painful memories . 
  worst case is when you feel a spider on your leg but it 's too far down and you ca n't reach it without taking your hands off the wheel so you just shake your leg but that only makes the spider move around so now you feel it crawling on your leg and then ...

  somewhere in germany there is a conspiracy theorist that believes minarets are the remnants of alien spaceships , and this magazine cover just made his entire life . 
  i wo n't go into details , but i 've heard it is done with the man and woman in separate rooms and there is a turkey baster involved .

  i still think we 're leading the way when it comes to shitty elections , but it 's strangely comforting to see other countries struggling to get their shit together as well . 
  / r/lithuaniaspheres for the curious, 
  i wondered when i would see the eu make a move on allocating spectrum for 5g . 
  the fcc here in the us recently voted that nearly 10 ghz of spectrum would be available in frequencies above 24 ghz . 
  i 'll be really interested to see how this develops . 
  we 'd probably be first in small arms even if you only counted sales to our civilian population .

  the resulting smokescreen from shooting a blackpowder rifle would give you plenty of time to escape . 
  seriously , some guy had one at the range one time and everyone else had to stop shooting for like 10 seconds while we waited for the smoke to clear . 
  logisch is n't a noun here . 
   i 'm glad that there are still such logically thinking people as you , thanks . 
  it 's phrased a little awkwardly in english but i did it that way so you can see exactly where each part of the english and german sentences line up . 
  we actually have a [ nationwide train network ] ( https://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/948/674/system0211_101web,0.pdf ) , but it 's not too popular because for most destinations it 's just easier to fly . 
  nyc to boston and nyc to washington d.c. hit that sweet spot where i would take the train if i did n't feel like driving .

  yeah . 
  i was walking up second ave on my way to the ottendorfer library when it happened . 
  definitely glad i was n't able to catch an earlier train . 
  that 's always such a weird feeling , when you realize how close you came to possibly being killed or seriously hurt . 
  i had a close call with a gas leak last year that killed two people , it really makes you think about how lucky you are that you were n't there . 
  glad you 're alright dude .
