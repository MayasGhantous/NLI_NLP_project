  marry italian chef 1 . 
  get residency permit through marriage 1 .

  does italy allow gay marriage ? 
  have n't you heard ? 
  appeasement is the only way to ensure peace for our time . 
  yeah really what a waste of a good cake . 
  honestly before i clicked the article i was expecting `` cake thrown in face '' to be some kind of expression that was poorly translated from german . 
  nope .

  in my lectures i have seen : 1 . 
  i noticed the accent , but i assumed it was just some regional dialect or something i was n't aware of . 
  if you told me he was a non-native speaker i probably would 've guessed russian though . 
  i also thought he was really easy to understand . 
  when my language exchange partner sends me an audio message i need to listen two or three times before i get everything . 
  this dude was very clear and i could just ignore the subtitles . 
  he convinced me too . 
  i 'll take 5 !,

  not when you have a fan or air conditioner in the window which is fairly common here . 
  that sliding part of the window is necessary to hold the a/c unit in place . 
   healing powers through vibrations of electrons i remember watching a homeopathy lecture on youtube once . 
  it was like this lady prepared for her lecture by watching a few episodes of cosmos after taking lsd . 
  seriously i have no idea where she got this shit from .

  well they have canadian football which is very similar to ours . 
  you euros may have been able to sway them when it came to things like healthcare and the metric system , but we got them in sports which is what really matters . 
  i do n't know if it is common knowledge in europe but the us and canada actually share leagues for soccer , hockey , basketball , and baseball . 
  one who is a big fan of the university of texas baseball team apparently .

  new jersey is great dude , you guys do n't know what you 're missing . 
  in the podcast series i used to learn german one of the characters was a medical doctor that was really into homeopathy .

  just tip well on the first few drinks and the bartenders would make them extra strong for you . 
  nowadays i just drink a couple beers when i 'm at a bar and get properly drunk when i 'm hanging out at someone 's house . 
  the crazy prices are just for bars and clubs . 
  it 's like $ 8 for 350 ml of a decent beer in nyc . 
  i know that feel bro .
