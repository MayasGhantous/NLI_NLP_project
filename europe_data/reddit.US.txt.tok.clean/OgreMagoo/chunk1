lol, 
  a small minority that is already causing societal problems and is growing more quickly than the native populace ... 
  i do n't think it will be a small minority for long . 
  look at the us and hispanics , for example . 
  fewer problems , because they do n't belong to a culture that is antithetical to progressive western values , but the size comparison is valid . 
  twenty years from now they wo n't be a small minority anymore . 
  a little misleading . 
  that implies it 's coordinated , which it is n't . 
  it 's just a migration . 
  a peaceful invasion , i guess . 
  but it still results - given a disparity in birthrates - in the previously-foreigners gradually molding the culture and government of the nation to meet their needs . 
  because they 're people of that country too . 
  make of that what you will . 
   thus in the mean time it is best to just liberate and deregulate as much of the private sector as possible . 
  not quite sold on that particular idea , actually . 
  whitey got ta make some babbies, 
  lol . 
  first of all , i specifically said , `` these corporations , '' i.e. 
  the corporations trying to protect their ability to sell toxic chemicals . 
  so your attempt to paint my perspective as naive is a hilariously obvious strawman . 
  i did n't say anything like `` all corporations , '' or `` politicians , '' etc. 
  you 're not going to sway anyone out of middle school with that sort of rhetoric . 
  if you 're going to defend views that are borderline indefensible , you need to up your game . 
  but more damning ? 
  the fact that you chose to respond to this comment with a sarcastic remark , instead of to the one in which i gave three papers ' worth of evidence against edcs , does not exactly invoke confidence in your argument . 
  refusing to address science is the last bastion of the willfully ignorant . 
  so it 's hard to interpret that particular decision as anything but an admission that the research does n't support your view , and that you 'd simply rather pretend that it does n't exist . 
  right after our inventions of nightmares , murder , and lukewarm coffee i believe, 
   just the american chamber of commerce that raised their concerns this is even worse . 
  if it had been american regulators , then at least they 'd be trying to hide it . 
  but as it stands , it 's a bald-faced instance of american business representatives flying in and saying , `` your standards are too high . 
  they 're hurting out profits . 
  please lower them and allow these toxic chemicals to be used . '', 
  god , the mental gymnastics you 're doing in order not to paint these corporations as the bad guys are absurd it 's so clear that they 're fucking people over for money , and very sad that you 're just determined not to see that . 
  you do n't really think they care about the common person , do you ? 
   it appears that both us and european chemical companies lobbied the eu commission to avoid blanket bans of that category of chemicals , and instead to ban via evidence and impact-based assessments . 
  which , honestly , does n't sound that outrageous . 
  i 'm basically just going to copy-paste from our [ last conversation ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/36v6dg/eu_moves_to_regulate_hormonedamaging_chemicals/cri4c7o ) . 
  tl ; dr is that it is totally outrageous , given that there is a scientific consensus on the deleterious effects of edcs : you know how reddit has such a raging hard-on for `` peer-reviewed science ? '', 
  guess what ? 
  when they say someone `` found a link between edcs and cancer , '' that means that a bunch of scientists published a bunch of peer-reviewed papers , each of which had a bunch of research , which says that edcs probably cause cancer ( and i 'll note that the standard for `` probably '' which is used to determine whether to publish something is typically 95 % ) . 
  it 's not like dr. dipshit was sitting in his office looking at wikipedia and said to himself , `` hmmm , i have a gut feeling that edcs are bad juju . '', 
  ** the research supports it . 
  ** i 'll point you to [ `` modulation of cytokine expression in human macrophages by endocrine-disrupting chemical bisphenol-a '' ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25128825 ) ( liu et al. , 2014 ) and [ `` evaluating chemical effects on mammary gland development : a critical need in disease prevention '' ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091782 ) ( osborne et al. , 2014 ) , and to the introduction of [ `` effects of the endocrine-disrupting chemical ddt on self-renewal and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells '' ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25014179 ) ( strong et al. , 2015 ) , which i literally just picked from the first 10 results of a pubmed search . 
  also , `` let 's let the possibly dangerous substance out into general use , and only stop it * after * boys end up with mutated genitalia '' is stupider from every perspective than , `` let 's be cautious and test it in controlled trials first . '', 
  or rather , from every perspective except the companies ' , who would welcome the opportunity to use the two years during which the trials * should * have been taking place to make money . 
  going off-script now - basically , 1 . blanket bans are totally warranted because edcs literally mutate little boys ' nuts and elevate breast cancer risks ; and 2 . 
  `` impact-based assessment '' is code for `` let 's procrastinate on the trials that we know will confirm how harmful edcs are , so that we can at least get two years of profitability . '', 
  ** because you know what those `` impacts '' that they 'll be `` assessing '' are ? 
  people who 've been hurt by these chemicals . 
  it does n't make sense financially for our society as a whole . 
  however , the economics for these lawmakers and for the corporations which lobby them align pretty nicely with this decision . 
   people here seem to think everything is banned until it 's categorically proven to be non-harmful to everyone . 
  that 's not what people here are saying . 
  what they 're saying is , `` if something * is * categorically proven to be * harmful * , do n't let it out on the market . '', 
  i just do n't understand how people can argue for this . 
  you know how reddit has such a raging hard-on for `` peer-reviewed science ? '', 
  guess what ? 
  when they say someone `` found a link between edcs and cancer , '' that means that a bunch of scientists published a bunch of peer-reviewed papers , each of which had a bunch of research , which says that edcs probably cause cancer ( and i 'll note that the standard for `` probably '' which is used to determine whether or not to publish something is typically 95 % ) .

  if you 're going to ignore the research , then defend yourself , or admit that you 're taking an unreasonable position . 
  because the science is pretty clear that edcs are harmful . 
   if we let every single concern about a substance dictate whether or not it 's allowed we 'd never allow anything for sale . 
  you ca n't seriously believe this . 
  provide some proof for your slippery slope argument , 'cause it sounds like bs . 
  most saleable goods do n't have these sorts of concerns attached to them - concerns upon which the scientific community has largely reached a consensus . 
  to pretend that all substances are as controversial as edcs ( and just look at the name , decided upon by impartial scientists - does that sound healthy ? ), 
  also , `` let 's let the possibly dangerous substance out into general use , and only stop it * after * boys start showing signs of mutated genitalia '' is stupider from every perspective than , `` let 's be cautious and test it in controlled trials first . '', 
  or rather , from every perspective except the companies ' , who would welcome the opportunity to use the two years during which the trials should have been taking place to make money . 
  and your `` well the tobacco industry does it ! '', 
  example is frankly evil . 
  if something bad is happening , why on earth would you use that to argue that something else wrong should happen as well ? 
  also , that argument means that you 're implicitly admitting that it has a negative impact on our communities . 
  do n't defend corporations when they sacrifice your health for their profits . 
  you 're advocating against your own interest . 
  and mine , too , because we live in the same global community . 
  so figure out what team you 're on . 
  would love to hear a response . 
  because i ca n't imagine how you could possibly defend that position , and i like surprises . 
  they provide a video and photos , so unless you can come up with a reason to discredit those , the rational move is to believe them . 
  it 's literally photographic evidence . 
  his response was pretty good ... 
  that 's so fucked up, 
  that 's been acknowledged in the articles on the topic which i 've seen . 
  apparently they 've been increasing the ratio of wood pulp to cheese , is the issue, 
  the views of the filmmaker do n't give the immigrants license to attack him . 
  that 's absurd . 
  its, 
  ah thanks, 
  exactly , there 're just way more muslims in europe so they 're insulated from that sort of social pressure . 
  two bombers are enough to send ~ ~ the country ~ ~ a city of 1.2 million into a lockdown ? 
  that 's an impressive roi for the terrorists . 
  i 'm sorry but that is absolutely a tom hanks, 
  ai n't nothing covert about that, 
   gaybar not a dutch speaker but i think i know this one, 
   what a time to be undead !, 
  ftfy, 
  looks damn good .
