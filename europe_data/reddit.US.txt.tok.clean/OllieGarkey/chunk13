  you misunderstand me , and that 's probably my fault . 
  i did n't take it as a sleight against the us . 
  i took it as undue praise for german scientific advancement in the period in question . 
  there 's this real myth that we have to deal with in history that the germans were somehow super advanced technologically compared to everyone else , that the rest of us were somehow intellectually inferior . 
  that the result was the germans had all these fantastic weapons that never got off the ground , and wonderfully engineered machines . 
  the truth is that everyone else had equal or better technology to the germans , but the germans were willing to send soldiers to war in experimental , unproven machines that were as much of a danger to their own soldiers as they were to the enemy . 
  german tanks armor was thicker , but was n't properly sloped , so american , british , and russian guns of smaller caliber had no real trouble punching through . 
  their engines included a ton of new ideas , but the problems had n't been worked out , so their tanks tended to catch on fire en-route to the battlefield . 
  *** today *** 's german engineering is top class because today 's germans worked extremely hard to develop a reputation for precision and quality work . 
  but in the 40s , americans and brits had access to jet technology via patents filed by maxime guillaume and frank whittle , but were n't keen on sending soldiers off to war in machinery that had n't been proved to work . 
  plus , it 's more strategically advisable to build large numbers of proven systems rather than spending a lot of money on something that requires new materials , new factories , and is n't even proven to work . 
  the germans of that era were not somehow brilliant or more technologically advanced , they were simply reckless , and that 's a big part of why they lost the war . 
  there 's this worshipfulness of german thought and engineering in the period which is incredibly overstated . 
   if great minds had not fled germany because what hitler was doing was morally corrupt the us probably would n't have achieved nukes so soon . 
  yes , because the us did n't have great minds like , say , robert goddard , creator of modern rocketry . 
  or people like harold urey , the discoverer of deuterium , eger murphree , whose understanding of physics and chemistry took atomic weapons from theoretical to possible from an engineering perspective , or jesse beams who invented the centrifugal process by which uranium can be enriched to weapons-grade . 
  refugee scientists absolutely and unquestionably helped the us develop the bomb , but we had scientists of our own . 
  what 's more important is that the lack of those scientists prevented germany from successfully completing their own nuclear program . 
  after wwii . 
  in 1939 , france had more and better tanks than the germans did , and the raf could have shredded the luftwaffe easily . 
  the sitzkrieg , where the uk and france refused to invade germany , lengthened the war significantly , giving germany the time it needed to build up enough of a sizable military to take on france and the uk . 
   and the us the united kingdom was a massive , globe-spanning empire which ruled about 25 % of the world 's population at the time . 
  60 % of all ships afloat were built on the river clyde , and another 5-10 % elsewhere in the uk . 
  we were pipsqueaks compared to the british empire of the day . 
  the british empire was ** the ** globe-spanning superpower in 1939 . 
  i drove a ford focus for the first time last year , took it through some mountain roads in southwestern virginia . 
  i 'm used to subarus , which have a reputation for being fairly nimble . 
  i love those roads , and know them like the back of my hand , so i do n't really pay much attention to things like speed . 
  i just push the car as hard as it can go . 
  i drove faster in that little economy car than i 'd ever driven on those roads . 
  compared to a focus , everything is a fat tank . 
  for those wondering about the uk : scotland : s\u016bg\u00e9l\u00e1n / su guo lan wales : w\u0113i ' \u011brsh\u00ec / wei er shi, 
  did n't the [ hague trust convention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hague_trust_convention ) clear up a lot of the common/civil law disagreements regarding trusts ? 
  good points re : expertise , but expertise exists in europe , too . 
  it 's not unique to london . 
  as for the scots , they 're a bit cannier than folk give them credit for . 
  when the terms of brexit become clear , and there 's no choice not to undergo significant economic pain , they 'll choose the scenario which leaves them better off in the long run , because everyone 's fucked in the short term . 
  based on what , gers figures ? 
  nobody outside the uk trusts those , and even ft has trashed them as starting with the answers and working backwards . 
  and it 's not possible for them to give scotland 15 billion when the uk-wide deficit is only 6.7 billion . 
  to date , there has not been an adequate study of what tax monies are actually raised in scotland or any other part of the uk , unlike nearly every other nation , which can tell you how productive a postcode is , taxation wise . 
  that does n't really affect the finance industry . 
   a competent administration , genuinely asking , because poe 's law is in full effect , is this a joke ? 
  london finance has already taken a massive hit over libor , so trust in london institutions was at an all time low before brexit . 
   it will take a hit for sure , but it will stay the financial center of europe simply because there is no other city that can replace it . 
  this is a very british perspective . 
  or english , anyway . 
  england 's history with empire has them focused on centralization . 
  it 's what their society has done for over a thousand years : centralize , centralize , centralize . 
  the feuding between the periphery and the london metropole tore their empire apart , starting with my country . 
  new york is one of multiple finance centers in the us . 
  there 's chicago , boston , and miami , the latter being a major interface between us markets and markets in other parts of the americas . 
  the only other finance center in the uk is edinburgh , and that 's tiny compared to the smaller us markets . 
  centralization as done by the uk has n't made sense since the invention of radio . 
  in the age of the internet and global trading , trade hubs had exactly one thing going for them : prestige . 
  it 's great marketing to have an office in new york , miami , or chicago . 
  i 'm not sure the same can be said of london ten or 15 years from now . 
  the scots are going to leave , which is going to brutally fuck over rump uk 's balance of payments , considering that england has finance and scotland has industries that actually fucking produce goods . 
  wales and ni are too small to make any sort of dent here . 
  their largest food and drink export is scottish whisky . 
  then there 's scottish oil , lumber , and electricity , all of which will become imports for ruk . 
  what london has is a marketing brand . 
  with libor and brexit , i 'm not sure the brand can recover . 
  if there 's another major hit like scottish independence , it 's over . 
  true or not , financial institutions genuinely do n't care about that . 
  it does n't affect them in the slightest . 
  actually , they tend to want to be based in nations with quite stringent labor standards and a good social safety net , because then they 're not worried about political destabilization . 
  like brexit , weak coalition governments , scottish independence , and a potential re-ignition of the troubles . 
  they have exactly the same amount of regulation as frankfurt being that both were recently in the eu . 
  latin american countries like panama have fewer bank regulations than the uk . 
  as do a lot of asian countries . 
  ( edit : the point is that low levels of regulation do n't automatically make you a banking powerhouse . ), 
  the uk was just in an admirable time-slot to hand the european markets off to the american ones . 
  your 5:00 pm closing bell hits wall st at 12:00 noon . 
   aggregation yeah , because investment banks care about retail bank issues just oh so much . 
  these are globalist institutions that are not going to stick around in an anti-globalist environment . 
  edit : and just to be clear , when i say american markets i do n't mean us markets . 
  there 's bovespa in sao paolo who have about a trillion dollars in capitalization , and mexbol . 
  there 's canadian and chilean indices as well . 
  so it 's not just dow and s&p 500 we 're talking about when we refer to american markets . 
  the largest stock exchange in the americas may be wall st , but it 's not the only one , and there 's some serious money changing hands in those other markets as well . 
  what does london have to offer in his estimation ? 
  because according to the old myths , it 's over the water to the west of ireland . 
  damn . 
  up in the smoky mountains . 
  i used to spend summers in this uber-methodist little community called lake junaluska . 
  i loved going to this waterfall/blueberry patch called graveyard fields , swimming in that cold mountain water and eating blueberries til i made myself sick . 
  would love to be there instead of dc swampland today . 
  edit : found a photo . 
  my favorite swimming hole in the eastern us : http://imgur.com/a/bf0dl, 
  fuck me that 's hotter than i expected italy to get . 
  you would have !, 
  floridians think you 'll `` catch your death of cold '' if you do n't bundle up in those temperatures . 
  i love 15 if i 'm working outside , so long as it 's dry . 
  but i grew up in miami/ft lauderdale florida which is subtropical climate wise . 
  i remember the weather dropping to 21 and seeing old ladies walking around in fur coats . 
  it would almost never get to 15 . 
  i like 25c . 
  as long as things stay under 27 i 'm fine . 
  and then i like weather colder than that , too .
