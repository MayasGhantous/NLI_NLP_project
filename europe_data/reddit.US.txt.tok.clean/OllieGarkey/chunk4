  the number one priority in the mediterranean needs to be in preventing these migrants from ever setting foot in europe . 
  we send them back to cuba . 
  we send them back even though some of them have been jailed or killed because we sent them back . 
  it would n't be difficult for you to do exactly the same thing . 
  they 'll be successfully landing on your beaches , otherwise , and some of them will be dying . 
  i do n't think that it 's right to send them back , i think that economically , immigration actually produces a ton of wealth in the us , but what you do about your migrants is n't up to me . 
  i would hope you 'd stop letting them drown . 
  and honestly , having an interdiction fleet that sends people back does cut down on the number of people who try that dangerous and illegal crossing . 
   having nuclear weapons and a decent navy are n't mutually exclusive . 
  true . 
  but why build new ones that you 'll never use and do n't need ? 
   we could easily bolster our navy by heavily cutting or eliminating our ludicrous foreign aid budget . 
  i think the uk needs to spend its budget better , but most of what `` foreign aid '' actually does is support the uk 's own interests . 
  the vast majority of our two nations ' aid spending is on things like disease work . 
  and the whole point to that work is to keep diseases from spreading out of the periphery in africa and asia , and into the business centers . 
  there is a lot of legitimate , legal travel for business people from asia and africa to both the us and the uk . 
  students , academics , lots of folks travel . 
  disease mitigation helps make sure that when they travel , they do n't bring horrible pandemics back to the us and uk . 
  neither government is providing aid spending out of the goodness of its heart . 
  that spending pays for things in foreign countries that directly benefit us and uk citizens . 
  i know that sounds cynical , and it is , but it also happens to be true . 
  you missed my point . 
  my point is that this is an ideological crutch , and is false . 
   we still have this psychological thing where we blame our conflicts on european weakness . 
   please take that ideological crutch away from us . 
  that does n't mean that we do n't believe this . 
  the very few incidents where we 've taken other 's interests into account over our own are treated as the rule . 
  it has n't been true in the 21st century , at all . 
  that does n't mean that we do n't think that it 's true . 
  we still blame all of our wars on european weakness . 
  a strong eu would keep us from dispensing that blame . 
  edit for clarity : and it would force us to ask questions about * why * we go to war . 
   a united european military is a pipe dream . 
  it 's also unnecessary . 
  each state should have its own , strong , military . 
  these militaries should regularly train together . 
  the eu should set up a common defense policy , like the us has with mexico and canada . 
  i said this upthread , but on 9/11 canadian planes helped secure american airspace working with norad . 
  after hurricane katrina , mexican military units operated inside us borders to provide emergency water purification . 
  the us , canada , and mexico work together militarily all the time . 
  same is true of the us and australia . 
  it 's less true lately of the us and uk , because you do n't have a navy anymore , what with your insistence on spending your military budget on nuclear weapons you do n't need . 
  meanwhile scottish fishermen are catching russian subs in their nets . 
  my country spends money on some stupid things . 
  there 's $ 8.5 trillion unaccounted for from the pentagon budget that we are n't really talking about . 
  so i 'm not saying we 're perfect . 
  but working together is absolutely a possibility , just like we do with canada . 
  that 's something we do right , that you folks could easily emulate . 
  and we need to stop throwing money at our military like we 're making it rain , even though we can afford it . 
  edit : auto-correct does n't think that `` militaries '' is a word and changed it to militarizes . 
  i 'm making a second comment because i do n't see any discussion of the eu security interests that are being ignored . 
  so here 's two . 
  ** interest 1 : securing the baltic and the giuk gap ** recently [ a scottish fisherman caught a russian submarine in his net . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3005849/questions-mod-skipper-says-dragged-submarine.html ) the uk 's military focus is idiotic . 
  they 're moving to more reservists , and they got rid of their aircraft carriers before their current batch was finished , all because they want to be able to afford nuclear weapons they do n't need . 
  they do n't realize how absurd investing in new nuclear weapons makes them look . 
  the rest of the world is hoping to slowly get rid of these things we ca n't ever use , but the uk has decided that having new nuclear weapons makes them look important . 
  but when you start relying on fucking fishermen for coastal defense , it actually makes you into a laughingstock . 
  the uk and the nordics ought to be working together to secure their territory , collectively , from russian naval incursion . 
  but so long as the uk fails to invest in conventional forces , that wo n't be possible . 
  the baltic states need help , and can help themselves if they 're part of a collective naval system . 
  the us , canada , and mexico do this sort of thing all the time . 
  on 9/11 , canadian military aircraft were in us airspace , helping us secure it . 
  when the katrina disaster occurred , mexican troops entered us territory with water purification systems . 
  there 's no reason why eu forces should n't train together to secure the whole of europe 's coastline . 
  you break it up into zones , you provide berths to the larger nations in smaller ones so that their ships can work across europe , and you train and train and train together so that you do n't have to worry about russian subs damaging your fishing vessels . 
  if you do this right , then you 'll also have secured the mediterranean , and you wo n't have migrants dying in the water or landing on your beaches , because your coastal defense folks will have picked them up . 
  people try to make the crossing from cuba to the us all the time , and the us coast guard interdicts almost all of them . 
  usually , they 're saving people 's lives who are running out of water , and who are relying on ocean currents to carry them to the us coast . 
  those ships major purposes will be search and rescue missions for any vessel that gets in trouble , the protection of your citizens , and interdicting those migrant boats so that thousands of people are n't dying in the water every year . 
  ** interest 2 : keeping the russians out of the balkans ** greece currently has a larger military , if you count the reservists , than germany does . 
  that 's partially because of turkey/cyprus , mostly because the balkans are not the most stable region in the world , and partially because they 're one of the few eu nations that is actually keeping up with their military obligations to nato . 
  while the greeks are doing their part for european security in the balkans , you lot are punishing them economically . 
  meanwhile , they 're talking to the russians . 
  this could lead to a nightmare scenario : the russians get a naval base on the ionian sea . 
  they start losing heavy weapons out of the backs of boats , which are handed over to pan-slavic militia groups of the same variety that exist in ukraine . 
  remember , the russian pan-slavic vision includes the south slavs of the balkans . 
  now , there 's a highway for heavy military hardware from plastic explosives to missile launchers that leads directly into the heart of the european union . 
  because rather than coming from the caspian , or watching russian ships snooping in the adriatic where they do n't belong , you 've got russian vessels stationed in the balkans . 
  if those weapons get into the hands of various kinds of terrorists , a lot of people are going to die . 
  not to mention the people those militias might kill . 
  the russians have proven their willingness to hand over military hardware to militia groups , and to act in a terrifyingly destabilizing way . 
  greece 's economic stability ** is an eu security issue . 
  ** but none of you see how vitally important it is . 
  greece must be stabilized . 
  otherwise you will force them to turn to the russians for relief . 
  giuk gap . 
  the brits are relying on scottish fishermen to secure it , because they want to have cute little nuclear weapons instead of an actual navy . 
   we ca n't rely on usa indefinitely . 
  thank you . 
  something very dangerous can happen between the us and europe . 
  not dangerous from a military perspective , but from a social , economic , and diplomatic perspective . 
  much of america 's military and intelligence interventions in the 20th century were designed to protect primarily european interests . 
  this is with the exception of the world wars , where everyone 's interests were threatened by totalitarian governments , and the korean war which was a un action . 
  the vietnam war was a military action to defend french interests in their colony in indochina . 
  they left , and left us holding the bag , and we 're very bad at stopping wars once they 've started . 
  ** if the us had followed its own interests in vietnam , we would have worked against french interests . 
  ** we would have armed ho chih minh when he asked the us as a former european colony to help them fight the french in their war of independence . 
  we said no . 
  the chinese told him that they would give him all the weapons he wanted if he agreed to be a communist .
