  so he decided to be a communist . 
  he did n't care about the cold war divide before the us spurned his request for aid . 
  the vietnamese market would have been opened permanently to american goods . 
  we 'd have had a massive us military base literally within spitting distance of china , and we 'd have had the friendship , possibly forever , of a nation that we 'd helped gain their independence . 
  instead , the story between the us and vietnam is that we tried to keep them enslaved to their french masters , and killed a hell of a lot of them . 
  we 're becoming friends with them now , but we lost a lot of people in a war . 
  for vietnam , peace was impossible . 
  for us , war was optional . 
  ** if we 'd followed us interests in iran , they would still be a stable democracy today . 
  ** the cia toppled the iranian government , a democratic one , and installed the shah and his regime to protect british economic interests , specifically anglo-iranian , which is now bp . 
  the iranians were attempting to nationalize their oil industry . 
  we should have helped them do that , and then sold them expertise and equipment at a markup . 
  good for our corporations , good for our oil supply , bad for britain . 
  we decided that instead of pursuing our own interests , the economic stability of the uk was more important . 
  so we installed the shah , who was toppled by the current theocratic republic . 
  i hope that we can be friends with iran again some day , and i 'm horrified about what we did to them . 
  but that road will be very long , and it will take at least a century to repair all the trust that was lost , if it is indeed repairable at all . 
  ** when we stand up for european strategic and economic interests , we do a terrible job . 
  ** it 's bad for us . 
  it 's bad for you . 
  it 's bad for the people we hurt for you . 
  it 's bad for the future . 
  when americans realize that many of these wars are being fought to protect the economic and strategic interests of the eu , that this is what their friends and neighbors died for , they get really angry . 
  and then they get isolationist . 
  and they let that anger create hatred for europe . 
  that is one of the reasons that you hear americans say so much about how europeans are all weak and useless . 
  it 's factually incorrect , but it comes from a place of personal tragedy over the loss of family members . 
  and when we engage in stupid wars , like afghanistan and the recent iraq war , we still have this psychological thing where we blame our conflicts on european weakness . 
  * please take that ideological crutch away from us . 
  * please start thinking about the eu 's strategic interests . 
  ** especially when it comes to greece . 
  hey , thanks guy . 
  you 're alright . 
  again , i 'm sorry if i 've been a bit of a dick . 
  i 'm still waking up with some coffee , and it was n't my intention to be an ass . 
   your whole premise is incorrect . 
  if my premise were that estonia has no spies , then yes , that might be incorrect . 
  that was not my premise . 
  * my premise is that the idea that this guy was a spy is ridiculous . 
  * i stated that most of what estonia 's intelligence community does is counterintelligence . 
  if they have spies , those spies are going to be people who look like academics or business people . 
  they 're not going to be standing on the border . 
  if what you 're talking about is `` recon '' then there are two groups responsible for that . 
  that would be the border guards themselves , and the estonian air force . 
  estonia absolutely is doing recon of what 's just over the border . 
  they 're using these : http://imgur.com/icatbvu that 's an estonian r44 helicopter . 
  while that craft does n't have any fancy gear , they can be fitted with all sorts of electronic goodies that allow them to see for miles with radar systems that can penetrate dense forests , and high definition camera systems . 
  i do n't know if the estonians have any of those goodies on their r44s . 
  but i do know that the mission of those estonian air force wings is to fly around in estonia while looking over the border . 
  or to fly over estonian water looking for smugglers . 
  edit : the point is , recon is much , much more effective if it 's done from the air . 
  one guy on the ground in the forest can only see so far . 
  but an eye in the sky with the proper gear c [ an pick up heat signatures of people on the ground , even in dense forests , ] ( http://imgur.com/bppsqnn ) . 
  the estonians have helicopters that can be fitted with those kinds of cameras . 
  what you do with those helicopters is fly them around ** inside estonia ** while looking over the russian border with those cameras . 
  edit 2 : apologies again , it 's early for me . 
  apparently the air force units associated with the border guard no longer use the r44s for anything but training . 
  they 've upgraded to agustawestland aw139s , and i do n't know which model or configuration . 
  not sure if that matters to anyone , but facts matter . 
  so yes . 
  they 're ** absolutely ** doing recon like you described . 
  ** but they 're not doing it by sending some random schmuck on a hike . 
  ** because that would be stupid , and he would n't be able to see as much as a helicopter could , and he 'd absolutely get caught . 
  edit : edited for clarity . 
  it 's still pretty early for me . 
  ... an * estonian * spy . 
  a spy from * estonia . 
  * the only intelligence service they really have is * counter * intelligence . 
  spycatchers . 
  [ there 's the teabeamet , too , but they 're teeny tiny ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/teabeamet ) , and most of their work , again , would be counterintelligence . 
  which is sort of what this guy was doing . 
  edit for clarity : by counterintelligence i mean national security work , which includes stopping human smugglers . 
  the point is that he was n't a spy , he was someone whose job includes catching spies . 
  i mean , unless we 're all totally wrong , and russia has decided that it wants to store all of it 's super important military secrets literally inches across the border from estonia , this guy was definitely not a spy . 
  the way that you send a spy to russia is you hire an academic who studied something boring like medieval russian literature , and send them to a moscow university to do research . 
  and while they 're researching things so extremely boring that it literally hurts you to listen to what they have to say , they 're also gathering russian military and business secrets . 
  what you do n't do with a spy is put them on the russian border with 500 euros and tell them to walk east . 
  that 's just beyond stupid . 
  because they will raise so many alarms that way even if they do n't get caught . 
  they will have no reason to be anywhere a spy needs to get to to gather information . 
  there will be no record of them entering the country which will raise alarms ... nobody does espionage that way because it would never work . 
  because yes , there are tons of safeguards against it . 
  which is why it wo n't work . 
  the idea that this guy could have been engaged in some kind of espionage is itself so patently ridiculous that i have no idea how to be polite about disagreeing with you . 
  so i apologize for being kind of a dick , i 'm sure you 're a decent person , and i 'm assuming that you asked this question out of good faith . 
  congratulations to estonia for finally joining scandinavia . 
  sorry latvia , you still do n't make the cut . 
  someone needs to build an / r/murica for france . 
  they ca n't do it themselves because they 're on strike ( obvs ) . 
  true , but it also makes florida look like it 's the same size as britain . 
  which is n't accurate . 
  this makes my head hurt . 
  i recognize that it 's more accurate , and we should probably switch to it , but it just looks stretched . 
  though it does accurately point out that the island of great britain is about as long as florida . 
  edit : i was being kind of snarky , there 's a 200 mile difference between the two . 
  what do i think should be done ? 
  immigration . 
  what do i think * will * be done ? 
  more immigration . 
  there 's a point where you just ca n't fight the free market anymore .
