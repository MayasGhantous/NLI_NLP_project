  the moment i stepped off of the train into london , it felt exactly like new york with a different accent . 
  massive skyscrapers and new construction boasting luxurious condos starting at a paltry 3-5 million pound . 
  all mixed in with some beautiful historic districts , parks , lots of restaurants and plenty of pubs . 
  edit : pound , sterling pound , not euro . 
  sorry for the mistake . 
  next time you 're there , go visit [ orvieto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orvieto ) . 
  it 's a small etruscan town that was built on an extinct volcano . 
  absolutely breathtaking . 
  if i were to make a trip to hungary to see these things , how long would it take ? 
  this looks like some of the duomo cathedrals i saw in italy . 
  same with italy . 
  spend a few days in umbria or tuscany . 
  seriously , this should be a wonder in the civiliz ( s ) ation video game series . 
  gorgeous . 
   a blobby turd pretty accurate from a local perspective , as well . 
  gehry appears to have a knack for creating buildings that make you wonder how many and what forms of drugs he was/is on . 
  thanks !, 
  supposedly ( as legend tells ) it 's supposed to look like a smashed guitar . 
  if you like this building , here is our main library : [ seattle central library ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/seattle_central_library%2c_seattle%2c_washington_-_20060418.jpg ) edit : here is the [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seattle_central_library ) entry . 
  had to get in on this one . 
  america checking in : [ emp museum in seattle wa . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/aerial_view_of_empsfm.jpg ) edit : apparently , the name of the museum has changed . 
  it 's now the museum of pop culture , as opposed to the ** e ** xperience ** m ** usic ** p ** roject . 
  this better aligns it with the actual museum ( s ) that are housed within . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/museum_of_pop_culture#mopop_rebrand ) source for those interested . 
  there are some really awesome things that are n't overly-touristy to see in london . 
  a certain , literally underground , middle-of-the-alley italian restaurant , springs to mind for me . 
  there are also some really awesome pubs around whitechapel ( jack the rippers ' stomping grounds ) that i only saw locals in . 
  just depends on who you ask and how polite you are . 
  american here , but if you 're into history and in rome , go to the baths of caracalla . 
  spent an afternoon there with my wife and saw maybe 20 people . 
  a senegalese woman has a child with a man from taiwan , from there , they have many more children in tibet . 
  which way goes which ? 
   b\u025b\u0294\u0251 thin-skinned , you know what i meant , dammit . 
   what did i mean ? 
  ^ not thick skinned . 
  better ? 
  what really irks me about this is that it goes against what i have spent the better part of the last decade trying to figure out . 
  my actual lineage . 
  i 've spent hundreds of dollars in fees to websites to get a small bit of information that may , or may not lead to something , waiting for a new public record ( census record , etc. ), 
  to become available . 
  edit : and i wo n't even begin to talk about the awkward phone conversations . 
  ah , thanks for the clarification . 
  it 's freedom of mobility , but your nationality remains completely intact . 
  from an american standpoint , i ca n't tell you how cool it would be to be born in the uk and then be able to move to spain ( language proficiency depending ) . 
  the states are not that interesting to move about within . 
    you 're scottish if you live ( or have lived here ) , and have chosen to call here home . 
  so , you 're saying there 's a chance ? 
   ^ please ^ ^ say ^ ^ ^ yes ... 
  this question was actually the result of an interaction with a natural born european whom i work with , who thankfully , saw my questions about my european heritage as being a curiosity , and not some claim to fame . 
  he did admonish me to be careful about claiming to be of european descent , when in fact i was born in the us . 
  i have seen some ... panned responses elsewhere in life when an american talks about their genealogy . 
  i mean in a more general sense , and not the `` i 'm 1/3 irish ! '', 
  this was my question :  if you are a citizen of sweden , then you are a citizen of the eu . 
  if you are born in the us , in alabama , you are automatically granted citizenship to the entire country , not just alabama . 
  what i was asking is that if you are born in the eu , can you legally move throughout the rest of the eu , take residence and work in whatever country you decide to ? 
  would you begrudge them them want or desire to know and share in both ? 
  ok , i see what you are saying . 
  a question for you : my grandfather , not great , great something or other was born in canada and moved to the us , as did all of his siblings . 
  my mother was born in the us , but spent much of her life living between ca and the us . 
  my mother 's native tongue was french , but that was quickly lost because my grandfather realized that english was the language in the us , and so he essentially outlawed french in the house . 
  how would you reconcile that ? 
  edit : grandpa outlawed french in the house , not english . 
  wait , and please forgive ( again ) my ignorance here ... 
  if a child is born in sweden , or any other part of the eu , do they not have at least a base level citizenship within the eu ? 
  again , not trolling , but if you are born in florida , you have automatic citizenship in hawaii or alaska in the us . 
  touche , but which way goes which ? 
  if an african has a child with a chinese man , to whom does their genealogy lie ? 
  let 's say , for the sake of argument , that the family moved to africa as a result . 
  from there they had many more children , in africa . 
  my initial response quoted above was more meant to be tongue-in-cheek . 
  your response , however , has made me think about it more closely . 
  i have one question and i only ask this for perspective : how would you feel , or more accurately , what would your thought be if one of your children moved to the us for work , met an american and had a child . 
  would you consider the child to be american or irish , all legality aside ? 
  no , no ... good call out . 
  i ca n't speak for all americans , but i can for myself ... 
  i had always thought that this was ... 
  neither myself , nor the people i associate with , do this shit . 
  i have never been near this in american society , not with the people i hold close ... and now i wish i had n't seen it . 
  i feel dumb . 
  edit : removed some confusing language . 
  they got to you , too ?? 
  our politics are in complete shambles at the moment . 
  there is a lot of turmoil and we wo n't know the real outcome of the election until next month . 
  trump is the `` presidential elect '' , but the ec has final say . 
   wanting to find out about your ancestry is a totally different thing . 
  it 's pretty popular here too . 
  and the things i know about my ancestors are interesting ( one was one of martin luther 's buddies , another in the weimar republic lost his livelihood because he voted for the social democrats on a ballot his employer had marked ) . 
  it 's just that i 'm not them , and that 's the part where some americans seem to have trouble . 
  this , along with some of the other responses is what i 'm getting at . 
  at least for me , it 's really cool to find out about where my family came from , who we mingled with . 
  it 's really hard to trace that back from the us . 
  i know that some of my family were caught up in some not very good things . 
  trying to follow it across the pond is fun and supremely frustrating . 
  that does n't change the fact the i *** do *** identify with my european roots , though i know i ca n't lay claim to any of it . 
  does that make sense ? 
  i really wish that the internet had some way to express sarcasm outside of / s. 
  the first part was meant to be ironic ... the second part was meant to be the actual question . 
  apologies all around . 
    do n't claim that you are `` better at drinking because you are irish '' i apologize for my ignorance , but does this really happen ?
