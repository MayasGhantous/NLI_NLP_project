  * principal disclaimer : this is very generalized as education systems can vary drastically from state to state in the us . 
  * ** pre-school - ages 0-6 ** private schools like montessori or public preschool . 
  montessori and more recently , schools centered around reggio emilia , are generally private with tuition . 
  neither are compulsory , but some public schools require minimum levels in literacy and/or mathematics to begin elementary/primary school . 
  if you do n't meet these requirements , your child can be placed in `` special education '' ( remedial education , dependent on state ) . 
  ** elementary/primary school - grades : kindergarten-5 ( 6th grade is considered elementary in some states , but is not the norm ) , ages 5-10 ** you can either go public or private . 
  private school is tuition based , public school is state/federally ( tax ) funded . 
  you can start later than 5 yrs old in public school depending on your birthday . 
  this varies by state , but if you are born between september and december of your 5th year , most public schools will mandate that you wait until the following school year to begin . 
  this is general education ; readin ' , writin ' and ` rithmatic with science , physical education ( pe ) and social studies thrown in . 
  federal testing begins in 3rd grade , i believe . 
  some states also support annual or semi-annual aptitude testing . 
  ** middle scool/junior high - grades : 6-8 , ages 10-13 ** private or public with private being tuition based . 
  additional general education but with humanities and the arts added , e.g. 
  theater , chorus , woodshop , etc. 
  some states have begun programs which begin to focus more on specialized skills like computers . 
  foreign language can also be a part of the curriculum . 
  it all depends on the level of funding from the feds and the state , or your schools ' fund-raising programs . 
  federally mandatory with federal and state testing either annually or semi-annually depending on state , all grades . 
  ** high school/senior high - grades 9-12 , ages 14-17 ** general education much like elementary and middle school but with credit requirements for subject matter ( 2 credits in a second language , 3 credits in math , etc. ) . 
  you can take ap ( advanced placement ) courses which can provide college credits , depending on state . 
  my high school had a `` running start '' program which allowed you to take skills based courses that would either count as credits towards college ( university ) or trade schools . 
  this is still federally mandatory , but you can drop out at 16 , if you choose . 
  federal and state testing still applies . 
  you can take the sat and/or act tests in your senior year to help with entry into college . 
  most college acceptance is performance based , the higher your grades and scores from these tests , the better your chances are for acceptance . 
  something to note , in 9th grade , schools can administer the asvab ( armed services vocational aptitude battery ) test . 
  this test is a base assessment of your vocational and scholastic aptitude for the military . 
  ** college/university - grades 13 and greater , ages 17 and up ** state or private college , both are tuition based with private being more expensive . 
  i think everyone in the developed world knows about our `` continuing education '' system . 
  only wish i was joking , but i had teachers that made us do the pledge every class that they taught until 8th grade . 
  sometimes you got the same teacher for a couple of different subjects , you still had to do the pledge in both classes . 
  youtube aside , the smell , even to the woman in the background seems fairly off-setting . 
  how do you prepare it ? 
  do you open it outside and then cook it ? 
  please tell me more about stardew valley . 
  my finger has been itching to grab it from steam for a while now . 
  i play d&d actively and i want to check out dsa . 
  any good references ? 
  so ... is it it my mother that you have fucked , or just my sister ? 
  i get confused sometimes . 
  there is a bug where the civ you are playing will show up between turns and declare war on you . 
  i have also heard reports of the map launching with your clone and you can not open diplomacy with them . 
  essentially , you are playing with a phantom civ , who looks just like you !, 
  you 're a wretched human , and i applaud your audacity . 
   what i 'm excited for ? 
  i 'm never excited for games , because that can lead to preordering , and that hurts the industry ( and myself ) . 
  if i ever , by some twist of fate , happen to meet you ... 
  i will buy you all the drinks . 
  and i do mean all of them ... 
  try dwarf fortress . 
  just had n't heard of anything recently . 
  game studios have been known from time to time to shut game production down , you know . 
  sometimes ... once in a while ... every so often ... 
  i 'd totally pm this kind of project . 
  you should take the time to flesh it out . 
  no , i 'm a pm . 
  but i used to work for a group that relied on manual game testing when they were in development and for troubleshooting ... 
  have you tried dwarf fortress ? 
  i was joking . 
  it does n't come across well in text at times . 
  that actually sounds kind of cool ... any reason why you 're not so excited about it ? 
  i work in game dev and this sounds like something that could be fun , especially as a time limited run scenario . 
  * you have x amount of time to get out of this particular area without getting munched by the ai ... *, 
  i am kind of excited about dishonored ii ... maybe just a little bit . 
    i 'm joking , some of you can drive . 
  in circles ... you 've obviously never seen how we handle traffic circles ... 
  racing games are kind of dead to me . 
  i worked at a game developer and one of their main titles was a racing game . 
  being `` paid to play '' games tends to wear on you . 
  especially when you play them over and over and over and over again . 
  not for fun , but to see where it goes boom . 
   nethack not sure if joking ... 
  i 'll check open ttd out , free is my favorite price , afterall . 
  i was thinking about buying civ vi just to get use to the tech , civic and tile building changes . 
  i like to play on prince and that seems to be the most balanced . 
  what i have seen/read with regards to the ai and diplomacy though ... that is really scary . 
    although that is n't that hard if you play the mechanics . 
  this is what i meant . 
  i did n't play the original kingdoms game , only new lands . 
  i like the idea and the graphics are beautiful for being what they are , but it 's really easy to beat once you get a good rhythm going . 
  i 'd love to see cd projekt red complete cyberpunk , or anything action/rpg . 
  i had to stop playing witcher iii because work was suffering ... 
  i only wish i was joking . 
  i can respect that . 
  was hoping you 'd talk about the game a bit . 
  good luck in uni . 
  i 'd love to hear your thoughts on civ vi . 
  i 'm a huge fan of marbozir 's let 's plays on youtube , which is why i 'm holding off on buying it . 
  just seems way too buggy right now . 
  i never got into the railroad sims and do n't know much about tt . 
  i take it that you 'd recommend ? 
  i was very quickly bored of kingdoms . 
  once you learn the pattern ( s ) it does n't really challenge you . 
  i saw that they had a pretty sizable update recently , any good content ? 
  i 'm going to check out the others -- did n't they kill cyberpunk 2077 ? 
  i remember seeing some early dev discussion , but have n't seen much since . 
  waving the uk flag around in your flair like that . 
  ought to be shamed of yo ` self . 
  myself , i 've always loved playing the romans , i just really like the purple .
