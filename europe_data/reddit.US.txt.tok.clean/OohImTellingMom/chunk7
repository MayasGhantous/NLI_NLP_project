  well , it is hard to win a cultural victory with a ship of the line . 
  and then ? 
  care to share any details ? 
  it makes sense , your verb is just pigeoned ... `` where are we going ? 
  to get fucked up ! '', 
  your students are clever and that would have worked perfectly back when i was in school . 
  apparently i went for it literally . 
  it 's been a rough morning so far . 
  not even `` congrats on the promotion ! '', 
  or something similar ? 
  so , that 's officially stolen . 
   as in i 'm now officially stealing it . 
  love it !, 
  oh , i try to avoid it whenever possible , as well . 
  `` you 'll catch your death a cold . '', 
  - american grandmas american english is really weird sometimes . 
  after travelling fairly extensively in italy and spain , road markers seem to be more like guidelines than actual rules . 
  crosswalks are just where they can get you gathered in one spot to run you over . 
  scooters go where the hell they want , when the hell they want and they do n't look out for cars , pedestrians or traffic signals . 
  i mean who does n't , right ? 
  leave it to the scots to make a candy out of whisky . 
  the mere utterance of that name makes me chuckle still . 
  i look it up when i need a good smile . 
  this thread is about stereotypes . 
  speaking in broader , more general terms , when americans refer to mexicans and their `` laziness '' , it is usually derogatory . 
  i also live in washington and in the seattle/sound region your are correct . 
  head to spokane or vancouver sometime . 
  the negative stereotype resonates . 
  americans who call mexicans lazy are definitely not doing so jokingly . 
  but you are right , it 's normally the opposite . 
  do n't dip your pen in company ink . 
  also any variation on `` keep your tackle out of the company pond . '', 
  thank you / u/reinierpersoon for the very informative response . 
  your sentiments echo what i have been told by a couple of fluent german speakers that i know , both about the difference ( and similarity ) between it and dutch . 
  german grammar is definitely going to be a challenge . 
  as far as pronunciation is concerned , i by no means mean to say that it wo n't take some work to get right . 
  just that it 's something that i had to do with spanish . 
  pronunciation in spanish is very strict and mispronouncing a single letter can change a word 's meaning entirely . 
  using the example from a previous post - tengo h ** a ** mbre as opposed to tengo h ** o ** mbre . 
  all vowels in spanish are the same , they do n't change sounds outside of being in a diphthong , and even then , they largely retain their independent sounds . 
  they just mesh with the following or preceding vowel , depending on whether it 's a strong or weak vowel diphthong . 
  accents only change the emphasis of the vowel in the word . 
  all a 's in spanish sound like ah , all o 's in spanish sound like the `` o '' in `` most '' . 
  got ta be very careful . 
  diphthongs are even more fun , especially since spanish sometimes like to string them together . 
  the letters b and v are also fun , they change sound based on where they are in a word . 
  i 'll definitely take special care with regards to pronunciation . 
  i have been looking at declension since it was posted previously , yep that looks like it 's going to be a lot of fun . 
  cases will be a challenge . 
  as to gender specific , had to learn it once before , spanish uses two genders . 
  everything is either masculine or feminine . 
  i think that starting with german , which makes most sense because i know some fluent speakers already , will be a great jumping off point for other related languages , including dutch . 
  thanks again for your post , i 'll definitely add your advice and links to my learning plan !, 
  primarily . 
  i 'll search for other resources as i start to progress . 
  i know from the spanish lessons that duolingo sometimes misses the mark . 
  the intent is clear , but my wife asks questions about the spanish lessons that make me respond with `` wait , what ? '', 
  while she is practicing , far too often . 
  it 's not perfect , but it 's a good starting point . 
  i have already started working on duolingo . 
  awesome !, 
  thanks again !, 
  one of my best friends speaks romanian . 
  i will get around to it eventually . 
  right now i want to focus on a language that is usable . 
  i 'm thinking it 's going to be german . 
  it seems to have the most utility and it opens up the nordic languages as well . 
  i can read some portuguese and get the basic meaning , though not all the time . 
  i had a friend who spoke portuguese and we could talk to each other using our respective languages ( slowly and with care not to use any slang ) and that was really fun to do . 
  the remaining romance languages are definitely on the list , including romanian ; i love how that language sounds . 
  i just really want to try and go a different route , since i 'll be really digging in . 
  are there any resources for learning proper portuguese that you would recommend ? 
  any prefered resources that you could point me to ? 
  thanks , i 'll keep that in mind . 
  i 'm trying to help my wife with spanish right now . 
  the big `` fun '' we 're having is why words that end with the same letter as the next word starts with , all become one big word . 
  are n't languages great ?!? 
  this has definitely taken some of the intimidation out of learning slavic languages . 
  thanks for taking the time to explain it . 
  any other specific things that i should pay attention to ? 
  so either one would be a good `` next step '' but german would be more ... useful ? 
  that makes sense . 
  thank you . 
  yep , this is exactly what i mean . 
  i had to learn spanish to know what some of the english grammar i use daily is . 
  sorry , it might seem kind of pretentious , but knowing things like this is how i managed to learn another language at all . 
  i know that you guys ( europeans ) chuckle at our tendency to claim our european heritage since we 're not really part of europe . 
  we are americans , afterall . 
  that being said , i have traced my european roots back to scotland and my surname is still kind of common in ireland . 
  one day , i will get to one of the two languages , if not both . 
  that would make things easier . 
  in spanish , the only thing that changes the sound of a letter is an accent . 
  even then , it does n't change the sound , so much as the emphasis . 
  tu ( with accent over the u ) as opposed to tu without ; you ( informal ) and your , respectively . 
  sorry about the lack of accents , ` murican keyboard , and i am too lazy to learn the alt sequences . 
  what about diphthongs ? 
  are those something in polish , as well ? 
  that would probably be very helpful . 
  i 'll do that . 
  thank you !,
