  there 's a big difference between `` how about we actually find the people who have hurt us instead of [ bombing where we think they live ] ( http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/national/07-jun-2015/us-drone-attack-kills-9-in-nwa ) and then retroactively declaring them all enemy combatants , because fuck , is n't that * their * schtick ? '', 
  and coddling islam . 
  there 's huge chunks of syria and western iraq where the only structures for miles are occupied by [ isil militants who have actually lobbed fucking * mortars * at us troops ] ( http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/1 ) , and our drones are swanning around in * pakistan * ? 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  that 's what liberals do . 
  we call out bullshit that does n't make any sense , even if it targets people who are really fucking unpopular right now .

  that takes irony straight up to uraniumy . 
  i knew nothing at all about the topics before we discussed them here . 
  i do know what hatred and anger look like . 
  and i 've tried to point out to you that what you 're writing looks like hatred and anger . 
  i 'm worried that you can barely address any point at all without insulting serbs . 
  it devalues everything you say . 
  why does * any * of that matter ? 
  a * hundred thousand human beings * were slaughtered by a corrupt puppet state . 
  why does the awfulness of srebrenica even enter into the discussion of why jasenovac was horrific , except to show that we have failed to learn from it ? 
  the srebrenica genocide was a horrific act of hatred on a state level , and its scale compared to other mass murders does not diminish its atrocity , nor do any other historical events surrounding it . 
  all of that is also true of the jasenovac extermination . 
  in this light , can you see why a serbian might think that you are dismissing the horror of the jasenovac concentration camp when you so stridently emphasize the srebrenica massacre as the greater evil ? 
  i do n't know what you 've said on / r/serbia . 
  i only know what google can find . 
  your comment about jasenovac reflects significant anger and resentment . 
  others ' anger and resentment inflates and corrupts the meaning of your comment . 
  it 's possible that both you and / u/evil _ foot believe the things you 're saying about your previous statements , but our history is necessarily polluted by our viewpoints . 
  consider what your viewpoint has done to your view of your own history , and you 'll see why i do n't consider you a reliable source . 
  i also would n't consider / u/evil _ foot a reliable source , for the same reason . 
  if i want to know the truth about your words or his , i must look elsewhere , just as i did here . 
  no , but you suggested that jasenovac '' [ was n't anything special ] ( https://archive.is/svgmk ) '' . 
  it was something special . 
  it was people in power killing those they hated in great numbers . 
  were the numbers * as great * as auschwitz ? 
  certainly not , but committing state resources to the murder of 100,000 - 700,000 people is still a horrific crime no matter how it compares to other crimes of the same time period . 
  you seem to feel a great deal of animosity towards serbs . 
  sounds like a country where hatred is bred on all sides , rule of law is conspicuously absent , and the strong victimize the weak . 
  how to solve this ? 
  first , ask someone who 's better at policy and sociology than i am . 
  there are many of them . 
  indeed , anyone who has given the fields serious study will have better answers than i do . 
  my answer is naive and overly simplistic , but i do n't think it 's incorrect or harmful . 
  do n't hate . 
  you ca n't stop hatred with hatred . 
  i 'm getting the sense that he 's not a reliable source . 
  that would tell me a lot more than the `` 50 downvotes '' you cited in your comment , and makes me wonder why you would n't have specifically mentioned your personal experience in the first place . 
  the goal of the downvote/troll brigade is to make you think exactly that . 
  you got brigaded . 
  racists and ultranationalists on reddit do that all the time . 
  that does n't mean / u/hulg _ bears is one of them . 
  there 's no easy fix for the influx of extremism on reddit . 
  until something works , we either live with the downsides of community content promotion or go somewhere else . 
  super duper burger . 
  the hunan place up the street . 
  the `` taqueria '' a few blocks away . 
  you need 1500-2000 calories per day . 
  divided into three meals , you should rarely see more than 750 calories in one sitting . 
  a typical american restaurant doubles that . 
  chains and fast food may be to blame for creating the expectation of a feast for one , but independent restaurants still have to compete , and those willing to defy the customer 's preconceptions are few and far between . 
   you ate missing out bigtime best . 
  ev -- -- okay , best this morning . 
  it 's a combination of ludicrous portion size and the inevitability of sugar . 
  it 's * fucking everywhere * here . 
  i live in a suburban city , three blocks from a supermarket and within bicycling distance of a train station that will take me within a mile of my workplace in an urban metropolis . 
  i do n't even own a car any more . 
  i am far more the exception than the rule in my home town . 
  most folks have to cover two miles just to buy groceries , and commute to work 40 miles along a corridor poorly-served by public transit . 
  america come for the food , stay 'cause you do n't fit on the plane home . 
  given his attitude toward immigrants , i suspect the answer is `` yes '' . 
  he might say `` no '' , because sociopathy is still frowned upon . 
  well , when you think about the american phrase `` fire truck '' , you have to wonder if it was named by a five-year-old . 
  brits , meanwhile , drive * fire appliances * . 
  so sophisticated i can smell the pleather seats from here . 
  / r/greendawn, 
   that 's a great picture though , i 'm not a fan of the guy but damn , must feel lonely being there . 
  when i saw the photo , i imagined his train of thought was , `` i must be apart to show honor to the fallen , but this is * not about me * . '', 
  it 's a rare combination of commitment and humility . 
  earthquakes in l'aquila come in clusters , and have historically been [ deadly due to the lack of structural reinforcement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%27aquila#earthquakes ) . 
  after a minor earthquake , residents [ leave their homes for a few days ] ( http://www.nature.com/news/l-aquila-verdict-row-grows-1.11683 ) to avoid this danger . 
  before the 2009 quake a foreshock gave ample warning , and residents initiated this time-honored practice which had kept them safe for hundreds of years . 
  bernardo de bernardinis gave explicit reassurances in very unscientific language , suggesting that residents [ should return to their homes ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21632459-six-seven-scientists-convicted-earthquake-advice-have-been-cleared-laws ) after the foreshock , rather than sleeping outside . 
  the other six scientists were charged based on fairly vague links between their off-the-cuff analyses and de bernardinis ' statement . 
  more than 300 people died because they followed the `` expert '' advice of an amateur seismologist who was ignorant of the region 's history and its seismic tendencies . 
  that 's why he was put on trial . 
  my girlfriend and i were cracking up at this site , thinking they were trolling with [ non-mechanical removal machinery ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/hs92/8456/ ) , until we finally found the definition :  non-mechanical removal machinery are also known as ultrasonic , laser , photon beam , electro-discharge , ionic-beam , plasma arc .
