  i 've heard that even non-parisian french hate parisians for these same reasons . 
  to be fair , you were departing from a [ non-existent city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bielefeld_conspiracy ) , so perhaps that delay was never counted . 
  here is an intense deleted scene from * the raid 2 * : https://youtu.be/fs_qhmiz40e, 
  in the area i live in ( san francisco bay area ) , musk has a big cult following , and is practically seen as the god here . 
  for the record , while i am impressed with his companies ' feats , i do n't view him with a god-like status . 
   one place that was named after york was toronto , which was originally york , hence the royal york hotel ( the big monumental hotel next to the station ) and the historic fort york . 
  also explains why toronto has a district called north york . 
   chocolate bars you mean , mars bars are not the only ones that are deep-fried there ? 
  i was impressed by how bike-friendly amsterdam was , and it kind of blew my mind when i found out that you can travel the length of the netherlands on just bike lanes . 
  this is also done in spanish and latin american cultures . 
  no joke , i visited the country last summer and it really is beautiful . 
  `` denmark and norway are far better '' . 
   bonus points if his pro-brexit reasoning included `` damn foreigners '' reminds me of the ironic reasoning some expats have given : they left their home country to get away from immigrants . 
   2014 - downing of mh17 one statistic about this that shocked me was how a higher proportion of dutch people died in this disaster than americans on 9/11 . 
  i also felt moved by the respectful treatment given to the victims , in stark contrast to the blatant looting done at the crash site in ukraine . 
  i strongly feel that buzzfeed may have gotten inspiration from the * daily mail * for sensationalist headlines and content . 
  you mean eastern sweden/northern estonia/western russia ? 
  sure you 're not closest with australia ? 
  what about telling everyone to enjoy the beautiful city of bratislava ? 
  and then do n't forget to loudly say that starbucks makes it better . 
  `` i have 1/16 irish ancestry . 
  i love to get drunk and love leprechauns ! '', 
  here are some other classic askreddit gems whose answers are predictable , and do n't disappoint me when i see them : * `` what cancelled tv show should come back ? '', 
  * firefly * . 
  * `` what cover song was better than the original ? '', 
  `` hurt '' by johnny cash , with a reply that trent reznor no longer considered it his song . 
  * `` what is the biggest red flag on a first date ? '', 
  being rude to waiters . 
  * `` what grinds your gears ? '', 
  people who do n't use turn signal . 
  * `` what should be illegal ? '', 
  child beauty pageants . 
  * `` what mind-blowing fact do you know ? '', 
  cleopatra lived closer to the moon landing than the building of the pyramids . 
  * `` what should you never fuck with ? '', 
  * `` how did you meet your so ? '', 
  top answer is invariably `` do n't have one '' or `` my hand has been with me since i was born '' . 
  in general , i like discussion-based subs , and this one is definitely much more civilized and friendly than many others . 
  i also find it much better than / r/europe . 
  i have never once been treated in a hostile manner here by anyone , unlike on some of the larger subs . 
  in particular , i love to find out the differences between countries and cultures of europe , and find a lot of things about that fascinating . 
  for example , questions about food , movies , and shows bring up interesting insights that would be hard to find elsewhere unless you really get to know someone well . 
  king 's hawaiian sweet rolls are pretty good , though . 
  at least in my opinion . 
  can never go wrong with their chocolate , though . 
  i also find r\u00f6sti to be alright . 
  i was surprised to find so much indonesian food in amsterdam , but then i remembered colonial history . 
  but i 'd say that is a good thing , as indonesian food is so rare and underrated in most of the western world . 
  i flew swissair one time a couple of years before it collapsed , and i found it excellent . 
  i have also had a great experience with swiss in more recent years . 
  i also found their food to be really good on the 2 hour singapore to bali sector . 
  the food and service was easily comparable to that of singapore airlines on that route , at least when i flew , and at less than half the price . 
  between san francisco and ams , the food and service were also good . 
  nothing new for weird pizza toppings in japan . 
  there can also be pizzas with mayonnaise ... * shudders * . 
  til aberdeen is the wales of scotland . 
  til fruit salad is called macedonia in italian . 
  what country are you in ? 
  this makes me happy for you . 
   our conservation of nature i have seen a lot of pictures , and your country looks really naturally beautiful . 
  it 's a shame it was n't even on my radar when i visited the area last summer , and i saw pictures a bit too late , but it is definitely on my to-visit list for next time . 
   what do you like about this sub ? 
  what makes you stick around ? 
  the wide variety of topics discussed here , from jokes and satire , to thought-provoking and important issues . 
  and for the most part , this sub has a great balance of being fun and civilized , which is a stark contrast to many of the large subs on reddit . 
   what could use an improvement ? 
  unfortunately , even this sub sometimes falls into circle jerks over some issues . 
  there could be an faq/wiki section for common questions here . 
  you could also have a `` country of the week '' feature similar to how / r/askanamerican has a `` state of the week '' feature . 
   what do you think about the traffic here ? 
  too many answers , too few ? 
  it 's alright from my perspective . 
  however , there seems to be a bit too many travel-related questions , and there are multiple travel-related subs for that . 
  also , many country-specific questions would work better in that country 's sub . 
   would you say your country has a strong enough presence here ? 
  perhaps a bit too much ? 
  in all honesty , i like how this sub acknowledges and welcomes americans and other non-europeans , including the availability of flag flairs from around the world . 
  for a long time , i just wished that some of my countrymen stopped troll-posting here , but fortunately it looks like that is being addressed in the last few months . 
  the only time lithuania was mentioned in my history textbook was in a chapter that talked about the collapse of the soviet union . 
  even then , it was only one paragraph , which had the title `` lithuania defies gorbachev '' . 
  \u010cesky krumlov is a lovely town you can spend some time in . 
   russia was also always a dictatorship well , not under boris yeltsin . 
  prague is well-known as one of the cheaper big cities in europe for many things . 
  other cities in the czech republic are also pretty cheap , at least from what i 've seen . 
  red solo cups . 
  to prove that they are very real , and not an invention of hollywood . 
  how widely spoken is the dialect from zagreb then ( if there is such a dialect ) ? 
  i feel that this victorian/puritan prudishness affects other anglo-saxon countries too . 
  i notice that not only the us and uk are like this , but also canada , australia , and new zealand . 
  no more needing to [ swap mail ] ( http://www.slovak-republic.org/slovenia/#politicians ) . 
   or kiev . 
  too soon . 
  deus ex machina !, 
  indeed . 
  2007 was a great time year in the 90s . 
  i remember during the opening ceremony for the 2004 athens olympics , the audience cheered loudly when cyprus ' team entered during the parade of nations . 
  however , some people may unofficially use certain day in june whose first anniversary is this year . 
  i 'm guessing it 's because of much lower costs in latin america than in the us . 
  but yes , i met quite a lot of european , especially german , backpackers when i went to costa rica and nicaragua this january . 
  that was actually how i first learned about the pointer sisters .
