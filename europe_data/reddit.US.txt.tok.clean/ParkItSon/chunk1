it is a different attempt . 
  so far your attempt has n't worked either . 
  and i doubt it would have if implemented full scale . 
  it 's not always about things `` working '' or not , it 's symbolic . 
  does the eu share a common fate or not ? 
  it 's about rich western countries showing that they stand by their allies even if it costs them some trade . 
  i 'm not arguing that they should leave i 'm analyzing how i think people will vote and why . 
  i think the eu ** should ** remain together and should strengthen ties . 
  but that is n't actually what i think they will do . 
  also if i were a brit and as pro-unity as i am i would still be worried . 
  the eu feels leaderless to me at the moment , it needs a direction and nobody wants to take any sort of lead . 
  that would frighten me if i were considering strengthening ties . 
  europe needs to learn to work together but i 'm not sure the will exists to do so at them moment . 
  also the bus will be there when it 's there . 
  knowing exactly when wont change that , are you waiting for the bus or not ? 
  lol just walked by the one on 67th and 1st , not working , typical new york . 
  buy the ticket take the ride . 
  also because why would i want the city to spend money on digital bus stops ? 
  i have a smartphone and it shows me where all the buses are and how long until they arrive at the stop . 
  the mta has real time bust tracking , no reason to waste money on the bus stops , just download the app . 
  oh yeah all of that is 100 % true . 
  the whole european logic of `` lets think of solutions and make a plan and do those things '' just does n't exist here . 
  the national culture is all about surfing the catastrophe curve rather than trying to make some sort of great plan . 
  american culture is reactive , not pro-active . 
  things just happen here , it 's only very rarely that there is any sort of over riding public drive to make a plan , americans do n't like or trust big plans . 
  this has it 's downsides , the infrastructure has a distinctly tacked together nature , because it is . 
  the systems for banking are old and arcane and frankly ridiculous but they basically work and no one is going to make a big effort to change the fundamental system . 
  instead some kid is going to create an app so you can send money with your phone . 
  the down side to this is that we do stuff in very stupid ways sometimes because nobody writes up a coherent plan and just follows it . 
  the up side is that we 're pretty talented at handling disasters like for example the 2008 financial crisis . 
  because americans do n't really have any sort of illusions about following a formula or framework of behavior . 
  so when everything goes to shit the government just starts doing stuff . 
  stuff which is unprecedented , probably unconstitutional , has n't bee planned at all , and is or maybe is n't totally ill advised . 
  and for some reason this always seems to serve us pretty well . 
  america is not organized , it 's nothing like europe in that regard where people actually seem to want and trust central planning . 
  here everyone is happier cruising along some sort of mad / unplanned / roller coaster ride of poor planning / inadvisable decisions / and sheer chutzpah . 
  it should n't work , but somehow it does . 
   dont the uk have an opt-out anyways ? 
  so they should not really care about that . 
  people will try to get into the uk ( which isnt part of schengen anyways ) no matter whether they are an eu member or not . 
  i 've kind of gotten the impression that people feel this is the get out or shut up moment for britain . 
  either they leave , or they 'll be required to play a larger role in the future of the eu . 
  more importantly the constant media attention just makes europe look like a mess . 
  i actually have connections to europe so i understand that the news greatly exaggerates the severity of reality on the ground . 
  but fucking christ the front page of / r/europe every day gives the strong impression that europe is burning around your ears . 
  do you think that makes people feel like they want to be a part of this ? 
  all the stories about europe right now are almost exclusively negative and divisive . 
  there is no leadership in any sort of serious solidarity movement that i see . 
  it 's a cat fight , there 's very little positive direction across the coalition , instead it 's just bickering , along with a few casualties ( the greeks ) that we try to forget about even though we know that they 're there . 
   the uk is n't affected by greece and will never be . 
  the people of the uk are impacted by their perception of the eu and the euro zone and what it means . 
  the greek crisis is a mess that makes the eu look bad and that weakens support for membership . 
   as if they would care about that . 
  you not being part of the eu did not prevent it , how do you see a connection between this and the eu ? 
  because it generates resentment , and distrust . 
  the german policy of tying your nation to your largest corporations means that corporate scandals are to a degree national scandals as well . 
  when uk journals are writing stories with headlines like . 
  [ `` volkswagen emissions scandal : diesel `` worse than the black plague '' and responsible for 50,000 premature deaths a year in the uk alone '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-diesel-worse-than-the-black-plague-and-responsible-for-50000-premature-10513845.html ) . 
  would you say that 'll have a positive or a negative impact on people 's desire for union ? 
   the eu has always been a mess . 
  people claimed the project to be dead every few years . 
  so far , the eu has overcome every crisis . 
  the eu has basically never overcome a single crisis much less multiple crisis . 
  the period since 1992 was largely one of unparalleled growth , peace , and prosperity . 
  the two military conflicts during that period ( bosnia and kosovo ) were not settled by the eu but by the americans dragging you all in kicking and screaming that you 'd rather not . 
  the eu 's first true test ( s ) began in 2008 when russia invaded georgia signaling a return of russian influence and power in the east . 
  the second test was the collapse of lehman brothers sparking the 2008 financial crisis . 
  europe has dealt with neither of these , extreme unemployment exists across europe today and the relief and stimulus packages are anemic and sluggish . 
  there is little to no hope of meaningful growth for years to come in much of europe because bad debt which you basically refuse to write off continues to strangle many european economies . 
  eastern europe feels extremely threatened by russian militarism but the european response has been decidedly mild . 
  america and canada have taken a much harder line on ukraine than anyone in western europe . 
  this was an opportunity to demonstrate real solidarity and while it has n't been squandered full advantage was n't taken . 
  now with the migrant and refugee crisis countries in the balkans are literally closing borders . 
  there is no coherent policy and easterners are in open rebellion against western demands , while western countries themselves offer ultimatums on numbers . 
  the eu does n't have any history of dealing with the sort of crises you are facing now . 
  i hope things improve , i really do , but this is unknown waters for europe , and so far no one is stepping up with a coherent leadership plan of any sort . 
   it felt like going back to the early 90s compared to europe and places in asia . 
  i honestly have no idea what this means , care to elaborate ? 
  i do n't see anything like smooth sailing for europe in the next year or two . 
  which is what makes me believe that the uk really is going to leave . 
  if the vote happened today i think that on balance they 'd end up staying . 
  undecided voters tend to favor the status quo in my experience . 
  but in a year or two there are going to be more migrants and refugees and more ( and more , and more ) stories in the news about it . 
  throw in some fire crackers like greece , catalan independence , the balkans whatever the hell is happening there , german manufacturing scandal or two . 
  after another few years of this i think europe is just going to feel like such a mess . 
  i do n't see any radical improvements coming in the near term and that 's going convince a lot of brits that europe is something they 'd rather not be so intimately involved with . 
  maybe you all just think i 'm a cackling american but i think the honest truth is that europe has a bit of a rough patch ahead . 
  threats in the east , massive unemployment in the south , migrants and immigrants from n. africa , demographic inversion biting into tax coffers , and on top of all of this slowing global growth especially in china . 
  i 'm not talking about the end of the world but i am talking about a challenging period of history . 
  and right now the european solidarity to handle this at all gracefully just is n't there and so the messes compound themselves . 
  refugees / migrants are a problem , and then compounding that problem is how nations are now relating to each other in regards to the refugees / migrants . 
  european governments already do n't want to spend money on their military equipment / abilities . 
  this 18 billion is likely a huge percentage of total revenue for the german defense industry this year . 
  so unless german tax payers want to pay that , plus the amount more they really should be expended ( at least double the current budget ) . 
  you 're going to need to keep selling weapons to the house of saud . 
  unless you want to rely almost totally on foreigners for military equipment . 
  washington lived in a world where the united states was a isolated from the rest of the world in travel times equal to 2-3 ** months ** . 
  we do not live in the world of washington and it would be foolish to live only by his advice . 
  washington 's america is not today 's america , and today 's world is nothing like washington 's , it is ** far far ** smaller for one thing . 
  we can not pretend that the doctrine of our founding fathers applies to the world today .
