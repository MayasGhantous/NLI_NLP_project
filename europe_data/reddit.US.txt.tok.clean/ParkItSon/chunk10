  which makes the situation very , very different . 
   ukraine eventually admitted that the disaster was probably caused by an errant missile fired by its armed forces . 
  [ 1 ] ukraine ended up paying $ 15 million to surviving family members of 78 victims ( $ 200,000 per victim ) . 
  never forget about a tragic accident for which ukraine admitted fault and compensated the victims for ? 
  those bastards . 
  remember that time russian or russian supported rebels shot down an malaysian airline by mistake . 
  then they admitted their wrong doing , apologized , and paid compensation to the victims ? 
  oh wait , only the first part of that happened . 
  if only there were some middle ground between an armored assault and falling all over yourself to make nice . 
  the ceasefire has been a joke , things improve for a week and hollande is falling over himself to advocate for an end to sanctions . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34174382 it 's a god damned joke , russia invaded and annexed a part of ukraine , they 've been in active conflict with the ukrainian military and are providing massive material support . 
  they shot down a mother fucking airliner filled with european citizens . 
  they are in the active taking territory in ** another ** european state ( see georgia ) . 
  and all that needs to happen for the europeans to put that all behind them and make nice with the russians is what ? 
  russia puts an end to active fighting , consolidates ** their gains ** . 
  and then sanctions can be lifted , the relationship can be normalized and russia can get back to it with a nice new piece of territory , having successfully flipped the bird to europe , nato , and the west . 
  garnering massive public support as being the `` tough leader '' who stood up to the west and made them back down . 
  maybe if francois hollande actually deep throats putin up to the balls he 'll put an end to this ? 
  or you know europe could sack up and actually do something about a war in their own backyard ? 
  the thing is that american nationalism is n't really the same as most countries nationalism . 
  because being an american is just and idea , and it 's something literally anyone can become . 
  i would consider myself to be a pretty nationalistic american , but for me that means things like . 
  being open to and accepting of outsiders , freedom of expression , standing up for your ideals , standing beside your friends and allies . 
  and yeah also being bigger , badder , and scarier than any other country or collection of them in world history . 
  which does n't necessarily mean i 'm pro-war , just that i 'm pro being and remaining bad ass . 
  our response to the indonesian tsunami remains one of the things that ( as an american ) i 'm most proud of . 
  and it is something that no other nations or even group of nations were truly capable of . 
  i realize that in reality of history there have been many events and choices which tarnished these ideals . 
  but to suggest that an ideal is null and void because it has not always been fully upheld is silly . 
  it is an ideal , it 's something you constantly strive for in a world which is imperfect and complicated and not always amicable to your ideals . 
  as an american nationalist i 'm not scared of anyone ( countries , ethnic groups or religions ) , i 'm pro-immigrant and i think being so is a tenant of who i am as an american , i believe that we have a duty to defend our allies , and to be there after disasters . 
  i think this quote sums it up well :  no people on earth have such abundant cause for thanksgiving as we have . 
  the past year in particular has been one of peace and plenty . 
  we have prospered in things material and have been able to work for our own uplifting in things intellectual and spiritual . 
  let us remember that , as much has been given us , much will be expected from us ; and that true homage comes from the heart as well as from the lips and shows itself in deeds . 
  we can best prove our thankfulness to the almighty by the way in which on this earth and at this time each of us does his duty to his fellow men . 
  the germans probably took out all those holocaust jokes . 
  well please clarify when should we get involved if ever ? 
  why is it worse for americans to kill someone in a place which is basically lawless than it is for a saddam or an assad to do so ? 
  why is it worse if the missile is launched by a drone than by a a-10 ? 
  people seem to be very disturbed by drones even thought the end result is dead people regardless of if that aircraft is being flown by a physical human or not . 
  is the only acceptable way to end someone with a knife , is that acceptably visceral and hands on to justify it ? 
  in your eyes being orwellian is fine , so long is its some dictator doing it and we can quietly condemn them without actually caring right ? 
  the global system is anarchic our laws at home do not apply to the world and to act like they do is silly . 
  well thanks for saying thank you , glad you liked it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halabja_chemical_attack it 's funny that people are being pissy about the american lack of a `` moral high ground '' while at the same time they 're ready to support anyone who can suppress wahhabism . 
  it would n't be hard for the united states to put an absolute end to terrorism either it would just require a complete abandonment of our morals . 
  i just find it baffling that the same people who scream like wounded harpies about our somewhat extralegal strikes around the world against terrorist camps ( with some unfortunate collateral damage ) . 
  are the same enraged people willing to promote `` ends justify the means '' politics so long as its some backwards ( but secular ) dictator doing it . 
  saddam was a bad guy , terrorist extremists willing to kill innocents are bad guys . 
  should we condone any governmental behavior so long as they 're supressing muslim extremists ? 
  iraq was a mistake , not because we toppled saddam , but because we did n't understand the politics or the ethnic tensions of the region . 
  instead we took our image of the world and tried to super impose that image on a part of the world that did n't share it . 
  the truth is this , you need to find a balance between pragmatism and principals . 
  we need to look for ways to pressure dictatorial states to become more pluralistic , then when the final pressure to change is brought ( preferably more politically than militantly ) a nation exists which is capable of finding its way forward . 
  dictatorships maintain stability so long as the dictator retains power , but once that collapses there is no civil society to fall back on . 
  that is the lesson i 've learned from iraq , some americans have learned that we should never get involved . 
  i 've learned that we must be more nuanced and measured in our involvement . 
  and that while dictatorships can be easily destroyed they leave little of substance in their wake to fill the void . 
   is it not the entire justification for the war in iraq in the first place ? 
  in real life , no that was n't the justification for the iraq war . 
  and neither was oil , it is / was about many things primarily geo-political . 
  it did n't hurt that saddam was a genuinely bad guy , but there is no shortage of them in the world and we are n't going to topple them all . 
  i do n't support the iraq war , partly for moral reasons but mostly because it was poorly thought out , poorly initiated , and poorly executed . 
  practicality first morality second , that does n't mean that principals do n't matter , it means that before you talk principals you should talk about your capacity to enact them . 
  the u.s. was in principal opposed to the ussr even during ww2 but in order to take a moral stance you need to also understand that principals alone wo n't accomplish much . 
   and why should everyone side with the most powerful country ? 
  besides , russia is more of a threat to greece than america ever will be , for america can not threaten greece without major disapproval from the rest of europe ( valuable allies ) . 
  i was n't suggesting that the united states would threaten greece , the united states does n't need to be so blunt . 
  behind the scenes it looks like the u.s. is playing a role in angling for greek debt relief . 
  greece is also consistently finding itself in some sort of scuffle with turkey , in the long term the u.s. is the party most likely to intervene and keep things civil . 
  greece wants to be viewed favorably by the u.s. because the next time something happens they want to be treated equitably if not preferentially . 
  the u.s. is lucky that it gets to apply pressure by doing nothing just as much ( if not more ) than it can apply pressure by actually being aggressive . 
  russia is threatening but so long as you reasonably believe they wo n't fuck with you that is n't an issue . 
  the united states can be threatening but mostly we do n't need to be , russia relies heavily on hard power without much soft power , the u.s. has a lot of hard power , but maybe even more soft power . 
   any concussions will likely be economical anyway , making military power ( i assume that you are referring to this ) irrelevant . 
  no i was referring to both economical and military . 
  for greece the biggest threat is that our military pressure would n't be there if there 's a mixup with turkey . 
  and there is also carrot of economic assistance ( political and direct ) that the u.s. is much more able to provide than russia is . 
  is france trying to become a parody of itself ? 
  the `` ceasefire '' has been a great success so long as you considerconsistent violations and fighting to be a success . 
  this is still pretty much an active conflict if a muted one . 
  maybe hollande should got to the baltics , offer security guarantees and maybe while he 's at it he can show some russians some prime real estate . 
  i can not fathom why the easterners do n't really trust you folks . 
  ever heard of a [ melian dialogue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melian_dialogue ) ? 
  we do n't have to be in the moral high ground , we 're just in the position of being the country that most people would rather not fuck with or piss off . 
  if the greeks sit down and do the math do you think they 're more worried about pissing off the russians or pissing off the americans ? 
  i 'm not really sure how it breaks down for them , every country has its own math . 
  i would make a bet they 're more concerned about the americans than they are about a receding russia . 
  but it has nothing to do with the moral high ground and everything to do with whose side you 'd rather be on . 
  big sun screen lobby is out in force today . 
  totally different attitude towards the rules and the law in the u.s. compared to what i 've encountered in north western europe . 
  i 've never been to denmark though so not sure how well it applies . 
  in my experience in germany / netherlands / austria people ** actually know ** and they ** actually follow ** rules like tax law and stuff . 
  stay at a bed and breakfast and the people will actually ask you to fill out a form to document that you 've been there so taxes can be paid properly . 
  residency / hotel taxes for situations like these exist in the u.s. but generally speaking they 're ignored so long as the business is small enough . 
  the u.s. kind of has a funny attitude towards law , especially tax laws / regulations , that sort of thing . 
  if you 're a big company and you 're cheating on your taxes that 's bad , and everyone will hate you for it . 
  if you 're a small business and you 're cheating on your taxes plenty of people will wink and nod and say `` good for you , fuck um '' . 
  when it comes to illegal immigrants and making a living it 's sort of a similar thing .
