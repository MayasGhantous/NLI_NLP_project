  there are some people who are maybe very opposed to illegal immigrants working , at the same time there are people who will hire them because they want to help them out . 
  there are people who may not like illegals at all but they 'll hire them because they 're a bargain . 
  and here more than most places i 've been , there 's a big split between a political idea and the reality on the ground . 
  for example we 've got vehicle inspections in most u.s. states , that you need to get done yearly to prove your vehicle is safe . 
  these are seen by many as annoying , and a bit of a scam ( mechanic says you need x , y , z fixed to pass and then they get paid to `` fix '' the issues ) . 
  my family as mechanically inclined types tend to view the inspections as a bit of a scam , and we do n't really trust most mechanics . 
  so after a few years of living in an area my dad basically found `` his guy '' basically an honest mechanic who is n't too knit picky about following the strictest inspection rules . 
  lets call him jimmy , now here 's the thing about jimmy , he 's a red neck , typical conservative , fox news , probably thinks donald trump is the shit . 
  so he should really dislike illegals right ? 
  well yeah , in the abstract i 've heard jimmy say some pretty racist shit , in the abstract . 
  but in the day to day on the ground reality ? 
  my dad actually found jimmy , by walking up to a mexican dude with a fucked up truck which had a fresh inspection sticker on it . 
  and asked the guy , `` where 'd you get your inspection ? 
  '' , and the guy gave him jimmy 's name and number . 
  it turns out that jimmy 's is where all the illegals in town go to get their inspections , because unless there 's an actual safety issue he 'll pass your vehicle . 
  now you might be thinking `` well he 's making a lot of money being the guy rubber stamping illegals right ? '' . 
  no not really , inspections are very cheap , chump change for a mechanic . 
  it 's really only worth your time if you find something wrong . 
  but with jimmy mostly nothing is wrong enough for him to flag you so he only makes a few bucks . 
  but if you talk to jimmy it turns out he thinks of the illegals who come to him as `` my mexicans '' and he feels kind of protective of them . 
  he 's willing to work on their vehicles and pass their inspections and he feels like he 's helping these people out . 
  he definitely knows that many of them are illegal , and in the broadest sense jimmy is kind of a xenophobe . 
  but in his daily life , these are `` my mexicans '' and he looks out for them and worries about them . 
  it 's kind of a weird thing , and i know it 's not unique to the u.s. but there 's often a big gap between american policy positions and actual american behavior . 
  policy position is that `` illegal immigration is a huge problem '' but the actual behavior might be `` these are my mexicans and i 'm trying to help them out , these are good guys '' . 
  there 's a lot more respect for people than rules here , so long as people and laws are reduced to abstract ideas it 's easy to take a hard line . 
  but the actual on the ground illegals are often well accepted so it is n't hard for them to blend into society and find work . 
  tldr : getting illegal work in the u.s. is n't hard , and people are way less worried about illegal immigrants in person than they are in theory . 
   i ca n't fathom how racism from whites tells blacks to kill , steal , have sex with anybody , riot and destroy their own neighboorhoods i 'm sure you ca n't but maybe if you 'd ever actually read a book you 'd be able to ? 
  the united states had legal institutionalized racism right up until the late 60 's . 
  what do you think that this is something that once the laws change shit is just fixed over night ? 
  we 're talking intentionally segregated and marginalized neighborhoods , destroyed families , decades of unjust and biased policing , predatory business practices . 
  and on , and on , and on . 
  it is only in the last couple of decades that we 've actually started to address racial issues in this country . 
  and we are seeing huge improvements , look at the collapse in crime rates across the country for example . 
  but this shit is not clap on , clap off . 
  it takes fucking time for very old and deep wounds to heal , for functional communities and families to establish themselves . 
  fucking hell you make me embarrassed to be an american . 
  it 's half and half , just like russia , eurasia is the typical term . 
  diversity can be a good thing if it offers complimentary capabilities . 
  a lot of redundancy without added capabilities is generally speaking not a good thing . 
  if for example you needed 100 medium lift , medium range , cargo aircraft very few would suggest that the most efficient means of getting them would be to build five separate designs and build 20 of each aircraft , right ? 
  same when it comes to strike fighters ( which is basically the only type of combat aircraft european nations really fly ) . 
  there is very very little benefit in having every country using different aircraft in those aircraft fill the same role . 
  and it should be pretty obvious why this is the case . 
  each aircraft uses different parts , and different engines , and as these are complicated machines each aircraft needs its own air crews . 
  if france and great britain are cooperating in some conflict they ca n't exchange parts , they ca n't really assist foreign air crews , and its probable that they ca n't even exchange weapons . 
  every weapon used on a modern aircraft needs to be qualified with that aircraft . 
  this is n't ww2 , these are n't iron bombs that you can throw out any open door . 
  we 're talking smart weaponry that requires all sorts of certifications and modifications to work with a new aircraft . 
  if this seems an unlikely scenario it is literally what happened over libya a couple of years ago . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/af3o7eld_story.html ) european forces ran out of particular munitions , for particular aircraft and as a result you 've got a lot of very expensive strike fighters sitting around doing nothing . 
  and to get them back to flying missions a particular manufacturer in a particular country needs to ramp up its production lines for a particular weapon to meet demand . 
  spending 200 billion on a military budget is n't any good if you ca n't actually use are your expensive equipment because you 're short on parts , or crews , or munitions . 
  and literally all three of these things are a problem in europe , right now , ** in peacetime ** . 
  this is why with 1/3rd u.s. spending europe does n't come close to having 1/3rd of the u.s. abilities . 
  because there are bottle necks all throughout the system and the forces . 
  sure the money has been spent but when something happens has it been spent in the right places , and can adjustments be made ? 
  no , so you end up with a lot of expensive equipment , and expensive personnel , sitting around doing nothing , because you 're short on one particular part that ca n't be sourced from anywhere but the original factory . 
  nah dude because like if the world ca n't be fixed quickly and cleanly overnight , like why do anything ? 
  like why even try , you know what i mean ? 
  and people say we 're at the end of the age of wars in europe . 
   german thunder is of true german character : it is not very nimble , but rumbles along somewhat slowly . 
  but come it will , and when you hear a crashing such as never before has been heard in the world 's history , then know that at last the german thunderbolt has fallen . 
  i 'm placing this quote not in a literal reference to germany , but more as a reference to the history and philosophy of europe . 
  a history that comes to mind when you see attitudes like these on the page . 
  they spend it inefficiently on redudant programs because there 's no over arching organizational structure . 
  european air forces for example use a combination of american , french , uk / german , swedish , and ussr aircraft . 
  you might spend 200 billion on defense but the lack of structure means you do n't get much bang for your buck . 
  in france we do not tip waiter , in france it is much better , in america we not tip waiter and it will be more like france , much better . 
  now where may i light my cigarette , no smoking indoors , oh how barbaric you americans are , i will smoke in doors , as we do in france and america will be more like france , better . 
  no you 're always visiting my house and my city though , and you are of all the peoples of the world certainly the most consistently insufferable . 
  seriously if paris is so great would you mind staying the fuck out of ny you are an almost unimaginable pain in the ass . 
  it 's like no one ever taught you people the most basic facets of manners . 
  could have something to do with people on here trying to defend behavior ( with a straight face ) that americans would get absolutely lambasted for . 
  steal some data , and europe freaks the fuck out , blow up a ship in allied harbor and kill a civilian ? 
  well that 's fine , national security , etc. 
  the hypocrisy is absolutely astounding . 
  well give me another froggie you ca n't fight for yourself unless you 're bombing civilian ships in a friendly harbor . 
  yes the other countries have ** never ** saved france from foreign aggression . 
  i guess it 's good the french have nukes you sure do n't have any clue how to fight without them it seems . 
  surrender in two days ( check ) , blow up an allies ship in an allied harbor kill a non-combatant ( check ) . 
  why do n't you leave the fighting up to the big boys and get back to buttering that baguette . 
  the reason he 's apologizing is because they screwed the pooch , fucked the dog , banged the schnauzer , porked the poodle . 
  ** they fucked up big time ** . 
  and they 're saying sorry . 
  and french nationalists like you are just trying to make yourself feel better by being aggressive about the last war you lost . 
  the french still have their panties in a twist about this : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/attack_on_mers-el-k%c3%a9bir , a situation where you had already surrendered to the nazis , and the british had every right to assume your complacency and willingness to betray your allies . 
   is there even an option that does n't make other people 's lives suck ? 
  there should be a real world `` world police '' as things sat and there is only america . 
  so we get yelled at for what we do , what we do n't do , and the perceived consequences . 
  europe which basically ca n't do anything mostly just sits around and writes books on what americans should do , should n't do , and why were to blame . 
  the developed world is complacent , they sit behind american security guarantees and lack the ability or the organization to act outside of their own borders . 
  if there was a truly unified european military combined with the american military and true roll sharing . 
  then the u.s. and europe could act with the force and duration required to police events like civil wars . 
  but the u.s. is tired and we have concerns in other parts of the world that europe will not be helping us with . 
  the syrian civil war is not between assad and isis . 
  isis is a complicating factor but the war would have happened with or without isis . 
  yeah but this is europe they like to pretend anything military does n't exist , unless they 're blaming military intervention for their problems . 
  this way they do n't have to pay for defense , now they want to not pay for defense ** and ** not deal with refugees .
