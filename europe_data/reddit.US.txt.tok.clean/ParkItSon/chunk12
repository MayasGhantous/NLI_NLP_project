  they actually brought a fair amount of left wing extremism from the trenches of ww1 and later they brought a fair amount of communist dissidence . 
  which was never as much of a problem in the u.s. as the wealth gap had n't existed as long nor as unbreakable as it had been in europe . 
  europeans brought their own set of troubles and tensions to our world , do n't pat yourself on the back too hard . 
  did you read the article , the agent said the boat could have easily been disabled and no one would have died . 
  but keyboard warrior knows best i guess ? 
  yeah , so much to be proud of , killed a couple of random civilians when just disabling the boat would have worked better for french purposes and no one would have died . 
  this was a failure in every way , the french betrayed an ally , their own agents , killed civilians , lost face with the world , and ultimately were forced to stop testing which is what they were trying to prevent in the first place . 
  it would , if american was a race . 
   surely such a blanket guarantee is not needed for that ? 
  and that justification would be used by any industry asking for subsidies . 
  not any industry , industries which are capital and skill intensive and seen as relating directly to national security . 
  industries like these are subsidized ( food production , oil production , ship building ) . 
   i do n't see why buying icebreakers domestically is required for american sailors to have jobs : even if we wanted to subsidize sailing , it 's not clear why we also need to subsidize ship-building . 
  for that matter , it 's not clear to me why i benefit from artificially pushing americans into sailing rather than any other form of work . 
  finally , obviously that would n't be directly-applicable to at least these ships , since these would be coast guard anyway , and would be staffed by us uniformed servicemen . 
  like i said at the summation , i think that ** now ** it could be reasonably argued that the jones act is outdated . 
  but it was not always so , in prior american wars we heavily tapped non-naval sailors to take on this role . 
   first , china already has a merchant marine fleet , which is what this would be subsidizing . 
  and they do , in fact they recently subsidized the re-fitting of parts of their merchant fleet so that they 'll have greater utility in a naval conflict . 
   i remember that one of the causes of the war of 1812 was the uk press-ganging people ( some of whom had fled the uk ) into british naval service . 
  that does n't quite sound like extreme desperation to subsidize british-only seamen . 
  since we 're talking about the war of 1812 it 's worth knowing that the new england fishing fleets played a major role in that conflict . 
  and that these fleets were functionally subsidized and protected by the u.s. even then . 
  and the subsidization paid off quite well as these sailors proved to be one of the most effective forces available to us . 
   and it 's not clear to me that the us would n't have a functioning ship-building industry were it not for mandating subsidies for ship builders for intra-country shipping . 
  it 's certainly not clear to me that we need to ensure a straight 100 % come from the us . 
  the u.s. often has a hard time competing directly with other industries in other countries because a strong u.s. dollar compared to relatively weak currencies ( and thus relatively cheap labor ) in other countries gives them a huge advantage . 
  heavy ship building industries are for example currently dominated by south korea . 
  you know the manufacturing crash in this country that has been going on for decades now ? 
  in certain industries which we feel are vital to our defense we 've been willing to subsidize because a collapse in the industry would leave us vulnerable . 
  in the same way that france / germany / uk / sweden have subsidized fighter programs because they do not want to be dependent on the united states as an arms exporter . 
  it 's like we 're your friends who just got a new car . 
  `` hey john , how are you ... oh that 's great , listen sharon and the kids are baking cookies and we know you have those shaped cookie cutters , mind if we borrow them ... i 'll just drive over and pick them up , have you seen the porsche , oh you have n't ? 
  well then i 'll just drive it over and we can take it for a quick spin around the neighborhood , see you in five ! '', 
  the jones act is old and it is n't about the military industrial complex . 
  it 's a typical piece of protectionism but with a deeper purpose . 
  the united states as a maritime power has long been concerned with the outsourcing of our shipping abilities . 
  the jones act guarantees the continued existence of an american ship building industry and jobs for american sailors . 
  ships traveling from one american port to another must be american built ships , under an american flag , crewed by american sailors . 
  being a sailor is a highly skilled and difficult job . 
  when a country like china talks about building a navy they do n't just mean building the ships . 
  they mean building up the experience base so that those ships can be crewed and maintained . 
  the u.s. with a more robust maritime history than china 's ( we are descendants of the british after all ) has long understood this and we 've placed great emphasis on supporting our shipping industry . 
  i 'm not speaking in favor or against the jones act , but understand that this is an act aimed at maintaining not just american jobs , but also american autonomy . 
  the idea being that should america find itself at war we have a ready pool of industrial talent to call on as well as a large pool of experienced sailors which can be enlisted in the navy . 
  i think it 's a bit out dated personally , the act came about in 1920 when the back and fourth between merchant marine and military was more fluid . 
  now with a large , professional navy , and a large fleet of highly specialized combat ships the concept that we 'll need to call on the civilian merchant fleets / shipwrights seems improbable . 
  and this act ultimately drives up the cost of internal trade . 
  i 'm not talking about this one off event , more the general attitude of the people . 
  in hungary the vast majority of people i met were grumpy , pissed off , and occasionally outright hostile . 
  in romania everyone was super friendly , cheerful , and excited to meet strangers . 
  i liked both countries , but hungarians are really mopey . 
  suddenly i 'm feeling an overpowering urge to build the world 's largest and most powerful icebreaker . 
  possibly with a carrier deck on top ? 
  romanians are so nice , hungarians why ca n't you be more like romanians ? 
  and no i 'm not talking about the fence , hungarians are grumpy as fuck , romanians are super chill and friendly . 
  it is , from the cdc . 
   lyme disease is caused by the bacterium borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks . 
  typical symptoms include fever , headache , fatigue , and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans . 
  i think the uk should stay , i do n't want to see further fragmentation in the world . 
  but the problem is the eu seems to have gone too far , and simultaneously not far enough . 
  they expanded both the union and even worse the currency to many countries which were n't prepared to operate in that framework . 
  at the same time they 've refused to develop a system of financial transfers , and they 've failed to develop the sort of unified strength and ability to counter issues like the migrant crisis and russian aggression . 
  if the eu and the euro had expanded far more slowly and carefully , to countries which could compete , along with a system of financial transfers that could have somewhat equalized the inequality between nations ( but not as large as would be required now as the nations would already be nearer each other in terms of wealth ) . 
  they then could have expanded the membership into poorer nations and better shared the burden of financing their improvement among-st existing members . 
  now the system is skewed all over the place , nobody is taking the lead on any of these issues really . 
  everyone is just kicking the can down the road hoping that things somehow resolve themselves . 
  it 's a shitty situation and resolving it is going to take require some drastic changes that i 'm not sure anyone has the stomach for these days . 
  depends on your opinion of giant boars in the living room . 
  if that sounds like fun , good trip . 
  the guys obviously over the top his username is `` worldleader '' but it 's also not a ridiculous notion . 
  if the uk decides to leave the eu and the eu responds with some level of trade / movement restrictions . 
  which they would almost have to do , after all what kind of message would leaving the eu but retaining the lions share of benefits send ? 
  then it would n't be ridiculous for the uk to enter into some sort of u.s. free trade agreement . 
  and if that were the case the uk would have slipped more into an american orbit rather than a european one . 
  the uk has a long history of balancing , they used to balance the powers of europe and the world between each other . 
  now they themselves balance between europe and north america . 
  if the uk leaves the eu it is perfectly conceivable that the balance will shift in such a way that the uk leans nearer to north america than to europe . 
  very relevant , remember that time you bombed london ? 
  now can we get back to the topic at hand ? 
  pro tip for estonians , ignore your president while he 's being treated with antibiotics . 
  my dad got lymes , they caught it early and gave in him an aggressive course of antibiotics . 
  antibiotics which made him trip balls , so yeah , be aware of the possibility . 
  alberta ? 
  something like 70 % of canadians view the united states favorably , so i mean that 's a little bit more than 50/50 seems like the opinion the united states really suffered during the bush years ( ca n't say i blame you ) but it rebounded almost immediately once obama stepped in . 
   american support for pakistan is quite welcome , imo - anything to prevent the government from toppling . 
  i 'm glad some people understand that this is the situation . 
  we support the pakistani government not because we think they 're oh so great . 
  but the punjab regions of pakistan are at least somewhat sane . 
  at least when you contrast them to the hardliner ethnic religious groups living in the highlands . 
  by supporting the pakistani government to a degree and twisting their arm about confronting extremists in the highlands we 're at least ** trying ** to prevent attacks across regions of india ( see kashmir ) . 
  which could very well spark a war between india and pakistan which might even go nuclear . 
  in the real world you unfortunately have to sometimes back some not so great people because the situation without them might get much much worse . 
  the problem is efficiency / redundancy that occurs when you 've got many small nations funding their own military with no over arching organizational structure . 
  since europe as a whole spends 3/4 of the united states you 'd expect them to have something like 3/4 of the capabilities right ? 
  but it is n't even close because the way it 's organized is horribly inefficient . 
  you have dozens of nations all using different equipment and each piece of equipment adds enormous costs . 
  uk , germany and some other partners spent a huge sum of money developing the euro-fighter , france spent a ton of money developing the rafale , sweden the gripen etc. 
  all that development funding going into aircraft that have seen total production numbers of less than 500 air frames . 
  that kind of kills the savings you get with economies of scale , and it means air crews can not easily be re-assigned to different places with different platforms because they are n't trained or experienced at servicing them .
