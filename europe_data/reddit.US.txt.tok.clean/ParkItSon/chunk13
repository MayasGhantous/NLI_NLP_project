  compare this model to something like the f-16 of which more than 4500 have been produced . 
  or 1700 + in the case of the f-15 . 
  this same thing applies ships , to tanks , to trucks . 
  the european nations all want to preserve their home infrastructure , and industrial capabilities . 
  which is totally understandable . 
  but it 's an incredibly inefficient way to build a military . 
  that 's why a some sort of combined european military would be a very good thing . 
  nato is great in the sense that it ties the countries together in a mutual defense pact . 
  but it does very little to nothing to address the organization / specialization problems within europe . 
   in all fairness americans have a bit skewed view of the global appreciation for their literature . 
  i think it would be a lot more credible to say that americans have no idea which of our authors are internationally renowned . 
  a lot of great american writing is basically about america , i 'm not saying it does n't have universal themes . 
  but it 's still basically about america . 
  which is n't unique to american writing , charles dickens wrote books which were basically about great britain and europe . 
  john steinbeck wrote books which were basically about the united states . 
  in my eyes they 're both great authors whose art has universal appeal which transcends time and place . 
  but at the same art is inherently subjective so the history and culture of the people who read it will influence their impressions of it . 
  what i 'm saying is that it 's a silly and conceded thing to try to judge something like literature on an objective scale of quality . 
  funny , but this is mostly what europe thinks about other parts of europe . 
  just saying the title is a bit misleading . 
  and in the hearts of the people the grapes of wrath are growing ... meow !, 
   siemens had to pay around 3 billion euro in fines etc. 
  several ex managers had to pay 5 millions euros from their private money to siemens . 
  people go to jail , corporations and the wealthy pay fines ? 
  lol when i go out on a date were totally going to split the check burnnnnnnnn . 
  i do , it sort of breaks down political lines but not always and not always as expected . 
  conservatives are obsessed with being strong and so they 're in favor of military spending often largely for the sake of dick swinging . 
  liberals usually talk about how many social programs you could pay for with 650 billion dollars per year . 
  but then there are conservative libertarians who want to become far more isolationist and that means protecting the homeland but definitely not global trade lanes . 
  and then there are liberal interventionists like myself who view our total global dominance as a general force for good if an imperfect one . 
  i think things like the iraq war round two were unfortunate mistakes , i also do n't extrapolate one fuck up to `` all military actions are evil and awful and selfish '' . 
  tldr : some americans want to spend more , some less , and a lot of them do n't really see it as something they think about or necessarily want to change . 
  campaign finance is probably a bitter issue for liberals than cutting military spending . 
   are you also proud of all the proof floating around that your country is becoming a police state ? 
  so you 're 14 or 15 years old then ? 
   are you proud of the fact that your country goes around and tries to be the world police ? 
  yes , i mean do we fuck up sometimes but we do a way better job of it than you folks . 
  you ca n't even police your own continent much less the world . 
  europe is happy to sit around while ethnic cleansing happens two countries away . 
  and we get stuck building the largest warships ever made to deal with your impotence , pretty annoying . 
  at least we 've got the strength and the nerve to put an end to that sort of thing . 
  but i bet you might be able to get everyone together in brussels and you can send a `` strongly worded message '' . 
   are you proud of the fact that your country has the highest amount of incarceration numbers in the world ? 
  no , it 's kind of fucked up , we 're working on it . 
   are you proud of being part of a warmongering nation ? 
  europe has a history far more warlike and blood crazed than the united states can hope to touch . 
  americans are literally building weapons to be less deadly so that we can prevent collateral damage in war . 
  you guys spent 30 years slitting each other 's throats so enthusiastically it finally killed you psychopaths taste for it . 
   are you proud of the fact that your nation sold itself out and now has a debt that can never be repaid ? 
  i mean yeah sort of , because it is the american market and american debt which has basically fueled the world economy for the last seven decades . 
  the rise of china probably never would have happened if it were n't for american consumers . 
  and i mean that it a good way , american style free trade has pulled more people out of poverty than any other program in world history . 
  which is something i 'm pretty proud of . 
  as for if we 'll ever be able to pay it off , who cares , it 's not as if we 're going anywhere if it takes a few centuries to pay off who cares . 
  ai n't not currency like the american dollar and that 's not likely to change any time soon . 
   are you proud that your country invades ( and drags their allies into it ) other countries based on lies ? 
  not really , happened like one time , but lying and geo-politics is hardly uniquely american vice . 
   are you proud of your country 's youth that are being destroyed due to the drug epidemics ? 
  fuck yeah , drugs are great , you should give them a try . 
   i highly doubt that you will be proud of your country in less than 30 years . 
  i do n't know , we 'll still rule the world and you 'll still live in some country where the capital city is , uhhhh whats the capital ? 
  whatever you say man , my girlfriends a european and she thinks americans dress like shit . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/10/10-truths-about-europes-refugee-crisis yeah , but not really , the total migration rate into europe is in the neighborhood of millions . 
  the actual numbers of refugees in europe right now is minimal compared to the numbers in turkey for example . 
  and yet turkey has yet to experience `` armageddon '' . 
  the migrant influx is a problem to be dealt with ** it is not armageddon ** . 
  i do n't care if the guy is literally rescuing syrian children from assad 's dungeons single handedly . 
  using a term like armageddon ( and i 'm not going to say this again ) a term which literally means ** the end of the world ** . 
  is an inflammatory exaggeration . 
  oh please , a few hundred thousand people have immigrated into europe . 
  the reason i 'm facetious is because the term armageddon is basically a word to describe a catastraupbic asteroid strike , or a nuclear war , or you know the ** literal end of the world ** . 
  even if tens of millions of people immigrated to europe it would not be the end of the world . 
  it would not be ideal , it would cause many problems , it would not `` ruin the continent '' . 
  migration is a bit of a problem , to suggest that this is literally the end of the world is a wild exageration . 
  this is a stupid idea , these governments are corrupt and ineffective . 
  if europe gives them money they will take it and run and leave their people with nothing . 
  which is why these people are leaving their countries in the first place . 
  if europe wants to try something like this they need to do more than throw money at the problem . 
  one option would be to work with whichever countries were open to the idea on charter cities . 
  https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_romer?language=en which have gotten some flack for being colonialismish , but they seem like a decent idea to me . 
  basically these would be semi independent city states with actually functioning infrastructure , laws , and regulations . 
  instead of areas with insufficient infrastructure , with laws and regulations that are infused with rampant corruption and cronyism . 
  but throwing money at the issue is doomed to fail , if these governments were effective in the first place everyone would n't be leaving . 
  the money will be wasted , the people will remain poor the desire to leave will be just as strong as ever . 
   as i recall , there 's a fence kinda hindering your average `` crossing a border '' . 
  yeah there is , and i think it 's both totally ineffective and pretty dumb . 
  but i do n't get to decide national policy on my own . 
  plenty of americans are anti-immigration and sound just like europeans on the subject . 
  but i 'm just saying i do n't there there is anything immoral about sneaking into america illegally and looking for a job . 
  it 's obviously illegal , it is n't immoral . 
   and were you going to stick the mexican in reservations no , i would make them citizens if that 's what they wanted . 
  but you know if they get uppity we can call the belgians to cut off their hands and brutalize them and shit . 
  are we going to play the `` whose the bad guy '' with a european colonial power ? 
   i 'm sure canada is very pleased to hear you support opening up her borders as well this might come as a shock but lots of canadians live in the united states and plenty of them would welcome open borders . 
  and some americans would probably move to canada as well . 
   my reply may be out of line , but you think of us as `` moral superior ? '', 
  do i think of europeans as moral superiors or do you mean inferiors ? 
  no i do n't think either of these things , i think migration / immigration is not a moral issue and to get mad a migrants because they are in your country is stupid . 
  they 're looking for a better life and there is nothing immoral about that , they may be breaking the law but i could give a shit . 
   we face an armageddon scenario yes , this is literally the end of the world .
