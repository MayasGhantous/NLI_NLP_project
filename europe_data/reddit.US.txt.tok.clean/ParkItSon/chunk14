   a descendant of immigrants and proud of it . 
   ignorant as to what a sovereign nation i probably am ignorant of what it means in your eyes . 
  i 'm actually a proud american nationalist , but to me being an american nationalist means :  keep , ancient lands , your storied pomp ! '', 
  cries she with silent lips . 
  `` give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . 
  send these , the homeless , tempest-tost to me , i lift my lamp beside the golden door !, 
  and less `` deutschland \u00fcber alles '' . 
  the cartels would probably be hurt by greater freedom of movement . 
  they currently heavily exploit illegal communities for support because these communities can not go to american authorities . 
  they also earn a significant amount of money through human trafficking . 
  when you make something illegal you 're essentially ceding control of that thing to people willing to break the law . 
  for example prohibition in the united states was huge in making organized criminal organizations more powerful . 
  because in criminalizing something you give a market monopoly to criminals . 
   we can only take in so much . 
  there are very few impediments to us accepting many more people . 
  we currently take about 1 million immigrants a year . 
  it would n't be hard for us to quintuple that . 
  there are plenty of places in the united states with surplus infrastructure capacity ( roads , water treatment , power , etc. ) . 
  and immigrants do n't in any way `` take jobs '' if anything just the opposite , more people means that we need to do more work to provide for them , and all of that work and demand creates jobs . 
  oh and of course space , we 've got more than enough space , the united states is insanely low density compared to most of the world . 
  we have plenty of places to put new people . 
  the only really practical impediment to immigration is peoples perception of immigration as something which will somehow hurt them . 
  but research and historical examples have shown us that this is not what happens . 
  take for example the mass immigration to miami after the cuban revolution . 
  people expected a wage crash in miami due to an sudden influx of low skilled workers . 
  bur it never happened , the economy in the area just grew to accommodate the new people and everyone ended up being fine ( the immigrants and the previous residents ) . 
  because there are people there who like being mexican and do n't want to be american ? 
  how did you get from what i wrote that america has some sort of moral obligation to invade and conquer mexico ... 
  if mexico wanted to join the united states that would be a different story . 
  so ask me again when mexico requests national assimilation into the united states . 
  if you 're asking if i would support open borders between mexico / united states / canada , yeah absolutely i would support that . 
   a large portion of these people are without skills or education which portion ? 
  syrian immigrants for example are pretty well educated people . 
  just because their country is currently war torn does n't mean it has always been so . 
  some 70 % of syrians have between high school and university level educations , with a high percentage of vocational / trade education . 
  and more than 80 % of syrians are literate with a large number of multi-lingual people these people have not spent their lives in refugee camps , they went to school , they had jobs , they are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves . 
  it just so happens that their country is currently in chaos and with all of their property , their jobs , national infrastructure and many of their friends / families / co-workers dead they are no longer in a situation where they can take care of themselves . 
   who 's going to shelter , feed , cloth and educate them ? 
  they 'll do all these things for themselves just like american immigrants have been doing for centuries . 
  they 'll get jobs , they 'll go to work , they 'll buy houses and cars and iphones . 
  no one needs to take care of them , they just need to live in a place where they are n't in constant risk of being murdered and they 'll do just fine . 
  europe is a different story , their well developed socialized systems makes it harder to incorporate new people . 
  because the government gives you so much a sudden inrush of new people who have n't been paying taxes is a major budget strain . 
  since you do n't get much from the u.s. government other than safety and access to infrastructure it 's a lot easier for us to take on new people . 
  they show up , you send them somewhere , and you tell them to get a job . 
  and immigrants from shitty poor countries are almost always happy here . 
  a big part of american discontent with our society is based on a high level of expectations that we should just have a bunch of nice shit . 
  immigrants typically have far more reasonable life expectations than born and raised americans . 
  for many immigrants ( from poor / war torn countries ) having a used car , a nice tv , a cell phone , a retail job , and a safe home is awesome . 
  it 's only once you have all of these things that you start to get pissed off about the fact that you only get two weeks of paid vacation . 
   take your self righteous bullshit somewhere else , the us does n't need a massive flood of migrants i did n't say we ** needed ** them , but they certainly would n't hurt us . 
  odds are they would make us much more powerful in time . 
  of all the resources in the world very few are more economically valuable than human beings who are n't being shot at . 
  so much of american might is built on the backs and innovations of immigrants . 
  we do n't need more people , but more people would make us a more powerful country , not a weaker one . 
  i know what the ancestors of europeans have done , but the fact remains that at the core nationality is an accident of birth . 
  a newborn baby in syria and a newborn in germany both have equally little say in the state of their existence . 
  and you can not honestly blame anyone for wanting a different life than what they were born into . 
  i 'm not arguing about the practical challenges of immigration , or integration . 
  i 'm just criticizing the view that many europeans seem to have that if someone is n't fleeing war or acceptably deadly conditions then they are in some way * bad people * . 
  this is n't unique to europe , plenty of americans will talk about how they do n't have a problem immigration . 
  but illegal immigration is bad because you have to `` respect the law '' . 
  like the law in some way makes restricting freedom of movement moral . 
  i 'm not saying that countries do n't have some rights to limit immigration , for practical reasons there need to be some controls on the process . 
  and there may be real limitations on the carrying capacity of a country which can not quickly or easily be changed . 
  but do not confuse the need for immigration controls for practical reasons and the moral high ground . 
  migration ** is not a moral issue ** , for the most part our homeland is just an accident of birth . 
  to suggest that you have moral superiority because you were born somewhere and others do n't have the same rights to pursue their dreams as you because they were born somewhere else is ridiculous . 
  once more , i 'm not saying that europeans are obligated to open up their nations to ingress from all the world . 
  but that is an issue of practical decision making and national preferences , not moral superiority . 
  i find it amazing that some people feel entitled to a good job , quality healthcare , economic mobility , and safety , just because they were lucky enough to be born in a nice country . 
  and then they feel like they have the moral superiority over people who were ( through no fault of their own ) born in a poor , and often un-safe country and they want to the same life opportunities . 
  mass migration is a challenge for europe , but suggesting that you 've got some sort of moral superiority over the migrants is laughable . 
  just admit that you 'd rather poor people , stay in their poor countries , so you can post about humanitarian aid online while safely ignoring the on the ground reality . 
  and before you ask `` do you want x number of migrants immigrating to america '' and the answer is yes , absolutely yes . 
  i believe the united states will only grow stronger with more immigrants and i would happily accept millions more people each year if it were up to me . 
  maybe we inherited the trait from you , all i can think reading a story like this is `` well duh '' why would you give them money or ships if you 're likely about to be at war . 
  win first and then talk about bullshit like honor , but first and foremost win . 
  reminds me of some quotes i 've read about the european opinion of americans during the world wars . 
   `` the american army seems to me as fine a collection of individual physical specimens as i have ever seen . 
  but from the standpoint of military discipline it is a mob , pure and simple . 
  the men appear slouchy , the officers to not stand out from the men in appearance and they do in any european army . '' dressing right and playing nice does n't win wars . 
  modern russian history does not begin after the fall of the ussr . 
  the soviet union ** was ** a russian empire , in fact the current russian state is a multi-ethnic empire . 
  it 's just so happens that it has been unified for long enough that internal conflict has * mostly * faded away ( with the notable exception of the chechens ) . 
  the history of russia includes the history of the ussr unless you 're being intellectually dishonest . 
  the nations which * mostly * made up the western boundary of the ussr were not members of the soviet union , they were occupied territories and everyone knew it . 
  so does russia have a history comparable to nazi germany ? 
  absolutely , stalin deliberately and knowingly exterminated nearly 10 million ukrainians . 
  they invaded , occupied , and brutally surpressed the nations of hundreds of millions of people . 
  the ussr invaded finland and killed nearly one hundred thousand of its people and was only deterred from total conquest and occupation by a frankly insane low tech resistance . 
  russia did these things , poland did n't decide to join the ussr , they were invaded ** by russia ** . 
  and the invasion was literally coordinated and agreed upon ** with hitler ** . 
  occupation by russia was probably better than conquest and occupation by nazi germany . 
  but russia did not save europe from germany , they conquered central europe and took it from the germans . 
  in fact one of the most notable differences between russia and modern germany is that germans feel guilty about what they did during ww2 and the russians think of themselves as heroes . 
  and the russians certainly beat the germans ( with enormous assistance ) but for the most part ( with some exceptions like norway ) they did n't liberate anyone . 
  they conquered europe from the germans . 
  i think i still prefer the b2 , certainly less bad ass than the f-22 in some ways . 
  but the b2 more than any other airplane is just flight incarnate .
