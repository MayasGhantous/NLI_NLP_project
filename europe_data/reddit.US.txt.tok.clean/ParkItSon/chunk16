  and there are in the neighborhood of 350 million legal border crossings every year . 
  the fence is a pantomime to placate those without the reasoning capacity required to escape a paper bag . 
  which is i imagine the same thing that orban intends in hungary . 
  it 's not about stopping anyone it 's about assuring those who worry about this sort of thing feel that the government is taking the issue seriously . 
  if only there were a historical example of some other country which built a large fence to prevent illegal immigration . 
  we did that , did n't do shit all . 
  these people are walking sometimes thousands of miles they 've already dealt with worse than a fence . 
  nobody starts a journey like this if a fence is going to deter them . 
  love john oliver but what he fails to neglect is just how far those fuck ups were from actually being nuclear disasters . 
  there are so many layers of safeguards that even if there 's a major security breach / fuck up a lot more things need to go wrong before a weapon can be launched / activated . 
   it 'll be better if you just sit this one out . 
  cool , we 'll let hungary take care of things . 
  it 's a military alliance , not a friends helping you with your domestic problems alliance . 
  europe is n't under attack , deal with your own issues . 
   are you seriously surprised that germans are n't gung-ho after seven decades of mistrust , admonishments and a cold war in which a military conflict would have been the end of germany as a whole ? 
  am i surprised , no not at all . 
  but am i sympathetic , no not at all . 
  germany fucked up just about as bad as any country could ever fuck up . 
  i get it you 've got some national trauma over the fact that your grand parents and great grand parents systematically murdered a few million people . 
  but just so you 're aware that does n't make you the sympathetic figure in this story . 
  `` oh i did something so awful and now i 'm really traumatized by what an evil bastard i was '' . 
  sorry no sympathy for your sensitive post holocaust feelings . 
  germans want to be rich , and powerful but they do n't want any responsibility . 
  and when people look to them for leadership all you do is say , `` oh were uncomfortable with decisiveness because ... last time '' . 
  germany was instrumental in the creation of the eu and the ez , but when shit hits the fan germany does n't want responsibility . 
  you want a access to a global marketplace so that you can keep the highest trade surplus of any developed nation in the world . 
  but when economic trouble comes calling you wring your hands and talk about implementing an international response . 
  the survival and security of the eu is critical to the future of germany but you do n't want to defend the eu . 
  because you 've got `` bad memories '' from the last time you had an army . 
  do you expect me to believe germans are terrified of going on an impromptu extermination the moment that they get their hands on a tank ? 
  deployment in the east is about ** preventing ** a conflict , not provoking one . 
  it 's about a show of strength and solidarity in front of a enemy whose trying to test the strength of an alliance . 
  russia is n't looking for a fight , what they 're looking to do is walk into `` contested territory '' thus forcing nato to be the aggressor if we want to remove them . 
  a show of strength is ensuring that we do n't need to be the aggressor . 
  german timidity is making military conflict more likely , not less . 
  like the american invasion of eritrea , or the american invasion of syria , or the american invasion of libya oh wait was n't that started by the french ? 
  i 'm talking long term trends here not next tuesday . 
  europeans are n't reproducing at replacement rates . 
  in the long term that has pretty clear consequences . 
  nato countries can act without it being a nato action . 
  which is what happened in libya , actions were initiated outside of nato and then the intervention was re-labelled as a nato action once it was agreed as such . 
  and just fyi libya showed us the exact opposite . 
  the eu members it turned out were basically incapable of maintaining the libyan air campaign without massive american logistics support . 
  i do n't care who invented nato what i care about is what nato means to the rest of the world . 
  every major nato deployment ever has been an american spearheaded deployment . 
  america contributes more to effective nato forces than all of the european nations combined . 
  any nato actions will be presumed to have an american blessing . 
  and since there 's zero benefit to us here this should not and will not be a nato operation . 
  oh please the netherlands sent a thousand troops to iraq for about a year . 
  deal with your own continental problems , americans are n't asking you for border control assistance . 
  we 've been paying for most of your military and most of your naval needs for seven decades . 
  so , yes . 
  nato europe is n't a thing , there is just nato . 
  and while the jnited states may not literally lead it we are by far and away the largest contributor to the alliance . 
  any action labeled as a nato action is going to require an explicit u.s. blessing if not u.s. participation . 
  and there is no way that is good for us . 
  europe should handle its immigrant problems by working with its relevant partners nato member or not . 
  but whatever this is ( or is n't since it 's really just one politician talking ) it should not be called a nato operation . 
  nato members are of course free to act outside of nato :, 
  africa and the me are products of their history and their geography . 
  not their genetics . 
  full blooded europeans are n't re-producing which is fine but they will no longer be ethnic majorities . 
  it 's happening in america and so far they are n't lynching white people or building mosques on christian graveyards . 
  europeans are a lot more protective of their cultural heritage than americans are though . 
  i do n't know my cultural heritage and i do n't have any particular attachment to it . 
  bull shit , a large number of the immigrants are from countries without even a passing relationship to iraq ( eritrea , somalia , etc. ) . 
  then there are refugees from libya , an intervention ultimately supported by us but nott initiated by us . 
  the syrian civil war can be linked to the american intervention in iraq . 
  but linked to and caused by are not the same . 
  ethnic minority dictatorial regimes attempting to suppress impassioned ethnic majorities are not known for indefinite stability . 
  there are many many reasons for instability in the me right now , some linked to the u.s. , some linked more to europe , and plenty of centuries old ethnic and international tension . 
  european immigration is a european problem , not an american problem . 
  if you think the american public is going to be even ** slightly ** supportive of nato intervention in europe to stop immigration you 're delusional . 
  not going to happen , especially not with election time coming into view . 
  if you feel that you have some right to our participation that 's fine but i 'm willing to bet just about any sum of money . 
  that no american politician is going to support a us nato intervention in the slightest . 
  it is a zero win situation for us . 
  we 'll get no love from the europeans for this , we 'll get no love from the africa or the mid east over this . 
  americans on the left and the right will be opposed to this . 
  liberals will see this as barbaric , and racist . 
  conservatives will see this as a waste of money on a conflict which does n't concern us . 
  and people in the middle will see it as both a waste of money on an issue that is n't ours , ** and ** as an over the top reaction to a bunch of europeans who are themselves over reacting . 
  so regardless of your opinion on the issue i will say with 98 % certainty the united states will not approve any nato action in this regard . 
   any economic regulation causes socialism , and socialism is slavery . 
  capitalism without any regulation leads to market defeating monopolies . 
  regulation is an absolute necessity , it 's a question of finding the balance between the level of regulation required to prevent market manipulation and domination . 
  and the level or regulation which causes stagnation , and ingrained inefficiency . 
  i personally think that many european regulations are overly geared towards stability over innovation and competition . 
  but that is n't the same as suggesting that all market regulations = socialism and slavery . 
  nothing you 've just written is an explanation of why my tax dollars should be used to deal with your immigration problems . 
  are german tax dollars being used to fund the u.s. border patrol ? 
  take a look at japan , that 's what i predict as the future of western europe . 
  a highly developed , highly educated society , with a capitalist economy but with high levels of regulation and direct government involvement in many industries . 
  add in a rapidly aging population with generally overall very low fertility rates . 
  this would predict a very long term period of economic stagnation . 
  but as an already developed , socially stable , and culturally unified societies this is n't really a problem . 
  stagnant decline without major political social un-rest . 
  there are a few things that are very different and they confuse the issue . 
  the eu messes with the equation in a significant way . 
  germany on its own is a pretty obvious dead wringer for japan , germany combined with the eu is hard to estimate .
