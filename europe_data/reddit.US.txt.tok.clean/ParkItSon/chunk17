  economic stagnation in germany is far more palatable than economic stagnation in portugal / greece / italy / spain . 
  as the economic divide between these countries persist and maybe even grows international tension will be a concern . 
  the probability of war is fairly low due to small aging populations and limited military capacity . 
  but the probability of economic conflict is higher . 
  the other big confounding factor is immigration , while japan does n't really have any immigration europe has a fair amount . 
  this may be the economic lifeboat for europe though in a sense it means the watering down of actual `` europeans '' into something new . 
  am an american , am laughing my ass off . 
  i 'm pro-nato , i 'm anti-isolationist , i still think that americans spend enough on global security commitments . 
  this is 100 % european issue and i 've got no interest in contributing my tax dollars to police europe 's borders . 
  i personally do n't view illegal immigration as any sort of threat to my country . 
  but it 's still worth noting that there are no nato troops along the u.s. mexican border . 
  so to re-iterate : 1 ) you 've got a larger economy 2 ) you already get a huge discount on the effective use of the worlds most powerful military 3 ) you can pay for your own god damned immigration controls . 
   would invite retaliation from iran , and whilst their navy might be crap they have enough land based missile systems to severely screw with 40 % of the worlds oil tanker traffic . . 
  they could put a plug in the straight of hormuz but they could n't strangle the americans . 
  with fracking and canadian crude the americans can find all the oil they need without leaving the continent . 
  a blockade would only ever occur if things had severely gone to shit . 
  the salient point is that in the asymmetry is heavily in favor of the americans and that 's what we want . 
  things would n't have to go that far , the point is that the ability to apply the pressure exists . 
   making parallels with past history when the world has changed so much since the advent of nuclear weapons and the fall of the berlin wall is just being ignorant . 
  they are the most relevant parallels that we can call upon . 
  nuclear weapons have minimal geopolitical impact on the ground , because to use them is doomsday . 
  the first nation to use them , be it russia , france or the united states dooms itself . 
  they are an effective threat but they are just a threat . 
  the reason this worked during the cold war was the understanding in the soviet union that domination of the entirety of the european continent ( and the actions required to make this reality ) would be such an enormous existential threat to the united states that a nuclear response was credible . 
  i doubt that many estonians believe that paris is willing to face a nuclear war with russia to save tallin . 
  and the french response to the threat along the east border has been pretty lukewarm so far . 
  it 's great that you have n't sold russia the mistrals , but at the end of the deploying a handful of tanks and apc 's to poland for two months is n't a stirringly dedicated response . 
   yeah , because the european union is enough proof that we only care about our nationalistic self there 's a big difference between what is basically a glorified free trade agreement and a true mutual defense pact . 
   contrary to the us that entered european affairs in 1917 , 3 years after wwi had started and in december 1941 , 2 years after ww ii start . 
  never ending apologies for not working fast enough for you . 
  i did n't realize that america 's number one priority should be restoring the peace on another continent with greater gdp than the americans . 
  all while fighting a second war in another ocean . 
  the french meanwhile had over a million troops ** on the continent ** and they allowed poland to fall and they could n't even defend themselves . 
  technology may have changed , the lines on the map may have changed , but at the end of the day french security commitments are n't much more than words on a page . 
  at this point canada and the united states from half a world away have more assets in e. europe than the french do . 
  the french and the germans offer support , the americans and the canadians offer assets . 
  if the germans and the french talked less and did more than maybe the e. europeans would have greater trust . 
   it has a strong military and a well-educated population . 
  strong military , weak navy , america could put an effective blockade on iran in an afternoon . 
  which is exactly why they 'll be a good ally . 
  what people do n't understand is that we do n't want `` best friends '' in the me . 
  what we want is countries balanced between each other and u.s. action ( or inaction ) serving as a tie breaker . 
  the people in charge do n't trust the saudis and they do n't trust the iranians . 
  it 's best if we have agreements with both of them and enforce the balance between them . 
  if one or the other pushes too hard against the balance it 's as simple putting the screws on one or the other . 
  in the case of iran that would mean implementing sanctions and limiting freedom of movement of the iranian navy ( and in a last resort situation intervening militarily ) . 
  in the case of the saudis putting the screws on them can be as simple as vocally do nothing , and letting them know that if they do n't straighten up we 'll step out next time iran is pushing its boundaries . 
  this should be the american strategy going forward , much less direct intervention and much more power balancing . 
  the problem with this sort of policy is that it feels wrong to many people . 
  it 's a morally ambiguous attitude towards politics and americans are uncomfortable with that sort of thing . 
  but i hope that we 've learned at this point that there is no inherent justice in anarchy / revolution . 
  i think it 's best that we establish a balance , enforce that balance , and use our influence to gently pressure these countries on humanitarian / civil rights issues . 
  nope largest concentration ( per capita ) is exactly where you 'd expect them to be . 
  in the south and in the middle states . 
  the ne and california have very low numbers on a per capita basis . 
  the coasts are where the vast majority of all americans live , but last time i checked it 's fairly backwards rural states ( georgia , arizona , etc. ), 
  that are actually implementing harsh immigration rules . 
  diverse multinational urban centers tend to be very liberal . 
  live in ny the ** vast majority ** of people here do n't have the slightest problem with immigration . 
  new york state is rural and red neck as fuck but the urban centers are generally very pro-immigrant . 
  nyc just implemented the observance of some muslim holidays into the public school calendar . 
  i doubt they 're volunteering . 
  you 've got ta love the french posting things like `` the european military is enough of deter anything with or without the americans / canadians / nato '' . 
  french security guarantees backed up by large and well equipped armies have such a solid history right ? 
  i think eastern europe does n't have any particularly compelling reasons to rely on the west europeans for security guarantees . 
  generally speaking the people who are the most anti immigrant in the states . 
  are people who live in areas with basically no immigration . 
  people who actually live with immigrants like them and do n't have any problem with more immigration . 
  cetaceans ( whales ) are recognized as being more intelligent and thus people ( some people at least ) feel that they deserve a greater degree of moral consideration . 
  in the same way that hunting and eating chimps or gorillas is viewed as morally wrong because killing one of them is thought of as killing something more than an animal . 
  that all being said and speaking as a vegetarian and someone who is very concerned about environmental issues and animal cruelty . 
  i find the aggressive protests against the hunting of particular animals in particular circumstances pretty hypocritical . 
  the greatest damage to the oceans ( and all of the other environs of earth ) is typically more the result of secondary effects . 
  hunters and whalers bare the brunt of the distaste people feel for the destruction of the environment because they are the most unambiguous demonstration of this behavior . 
  but in reality the whalers on the faroe islands undoubtedly do ** far less ** harm to whale populations than mass fishing / shrimping / general pollutants / co2 emissions / ocean acidification / etc. 
  as a person who cares about the environment and animal rights i do n't like whaling . 
  as a pragmatist who actually wants to see truly impactful solutions implemented to improve the environment . 
  i think that whalers are often scapegoats who we judge harshly in an attempt to assuage the collective guilt we share over behaviors which are in truth far more harmful to the environment and whales . 
  we call it warthog . 
  so did deustche bank , they just turned a blind eye at the time . 
  none of what happened in 2007 / 2008 was a surprise everyone knew this stuff was happening . 
  but they wanted to keep lending so they did their damn best to ignore inconvenient information like manipulated books . 
  buy the ticket take the ride kids , your problems are your own if you can ever sort them out . 
  so just so everyone here is clear at the core of the european immigration debate you 've got ^ ^ this guy ^ ^ . 
  but racism definitely is n't at play here . 
  if you 're interested middle easterners and `` blacks '' integrate just fine here . 
  more recent black immigrants do n't have a difficult time integrating at all . 
  it 's mostly the descendants of literal slaves who 've had the most issues . 
  a century of being property , followed by decades of legal discrimination and the deliberate destruction of the family unit have led to issues that do n't evaporate overnight . 
  `` it 's been well reported '' is the modern day equivalent of `` everyone knows she 's a witch !, 
  are full welfare benefits available to the residents of eu countries as soon as they arrive ? 
  because that just strikes me as weird , as a resident of the * caitalist hellhole * that is america you do n't get much just for showing up . 
  most of our welfare and benefits are dependent on at least doing something or having been here for a while . 
  so why not do that in eu nations put some work / residency requirements before full benefits are awarded ? 
  personally i doubt these people are benefit hunting , much more probably they 're job hunting and they want to be in a country with decent employment opportunities . 
  while greece may be a lot nicer than some war torn african nation the economic opportunities are n't a hell of a lot better . 
  i know a fair number of europeans who have left their own struggling countries for greener pastures in primarily germany and the u.k. 
  so for some reason refugees who end up in these poor countries should not want a better life . 
  because they are from some place horribly poor they should be happy not to be shot at regardless of any other life goals / needs / desires . 
  i get that it might be annoying that they want to find a better life but i find the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of you people to be hilarious .
