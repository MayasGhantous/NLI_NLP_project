  these people may have escaped from genocide / war / starvation / prosecution . 
  but none of that makes one lick of difference , they 've escaped and now they 've got a life to lead . 
  so just like anyone else they 're going to look for a job and the ability to support themselves and maybe their family back home . 
  if there are no opportunities in greece , or in spain , or in italy they 're going to do their damn best to find somewhere with more opportunity . 
  and your sense of indignaty that these people should just be grateful that they are n't being shot at is silly , self centered , and naive . 
   the question is what the exact difference is , i 'm arguing that the increase ca n't be too huge as it would n't be economical viable to exploit those lines . 
  it 's not , it 's a chinese power play . 
  it 's a soft power play but they 're trying to indicate a future of greater economic integration with china . 
  in a similar way that the tpp is an american economic power play . 
  trying to keep se asia balanced between economic ties to us and economic ties to china . 
  this line wo n't be used , but it 's sending a message . 
  just fyi i 'm not being paranoid or calling china sinister here . 
  i 'm just pointing out that this train has a meaning beyond its economic viability . 
   about 60 % of the material inputs for laptops and 30 % of the finished laptops depend on rail transport . 
  they do n't mention ** where ** those materials come from . 
  they sure as hell are n't coming from germany or europe in general . 
  what they probably mean is that materials for building electronics are often sourced from ** within china ** and then carried to chinese factories by train . 
  this is cheaper than importing raw material extra nationally . 
  it was wwi just about everyone on every side of the conflict was dying left right and center . 
  in the uk they did that whole `` join up with your pals '' thing , which was great until all of the men in a town / village would be wiped out in a single battle . 
   after marines were repeatedly urged to turn back by retreating french forces , marine captain lloyd w. williams of the 2nd battalion , 5th marines uttered the now-famous retort `` retreat ? 
  hell , we just got here '' . 
  battle of belleau wood , where the marines got their nickname `` devil dogs '', 
  i do n't really think this is an economically viable route . 
  first it 's long as shit , second it 's going through some severely mountainous regions and any sort of incline aggressively erodes rail efficiency . 
  yeah a container ship will take longer but it a vastly more economical way to transport bulky goods . 
  further the goods you want are mostly ** not ** produced in western china , but along the costs . 
  in that context trains to europe make even less sense . 
   but chinese-born chinese seem to be hilariously afraid of black people . 
  they 're are hardly any black people in china and there are a lot of negative stories about black people in the news . 
  unfamiliarity more than anything else breeds fear , so i 'm willing to give them a pass . 
  sooo ... we briefly went to war with canada , in on an island , in the middle of the pacific ocean , by mistake ? 
  yeah that 's pretty embarrassing . 
  severe demographic , industrial , and economic decline ? 
  russia is not some immutable concept it 's a group of people , if those people stop reproducing than russia will one day cease to exist . 
  russia as a country is in a bad spot in so many ways , do yo think people there feel optimistic about the future ? 
  do you think people there have an extremely strong desire to have children who will carry on the traditions of the great russian nation . 
  russia is still a powerful country but it 's also and exhausted country . 
  russia lost the cold war , it went from a place where russia could imagine a future of ruling the world / dictating policy / shaping the global order . 
  to a position of relative weakness and penury . 
  nations do not die overnight it takes decades or centuries . 
  russia is indisputably a declining power , will they self destruct , it 's very hard to say . 
  but to suggest that they will exist forever just because they 've existed for a long time is silly . 
  remember that very few serious people predicted the fall of the ussr . 
  making predictions of enormous change is something that people are uncomfortable with . 
  because ** mostly ** today will be about like yesterday , but history tells us that this is n't always the case . 
  mostly one day follows another and little changes . 
  but occasionally the world changes , and it can happen overnight . 
  in 1913 europe ruled the world , and few would have predicted its complete decline . 
  a mere 32 years later europe was in ruins , its empires were dismantled , its economy was shattered . 
  to have predicted in 1910 the absolute destruction of europe would have been far more baseless than to predict today the eventual decline of the russian state . 
  alright once again lets think about this . 
  pakistan is n't russia , in fact pakistan is in most places a semi-lawless nation . 
  central authority barely extends out of islamabad , once you leave the cities you 're really talking about ethnic enclaves that do n't really even define themselves as pakistani . 
  pakistan is an incredibly insecure and unstable state , so yes the u.s. and any number of other nations violate the pakistani border on a regular basis . 
  russia is a different story , despite their many issues it 's a mostly functional nation in the most basic sense . 
  meaning russia is able to effectively secure its borders and exercise authority and control across russia . 
  as for the ryan christopher fogle incident you 're just illustrating my point . 
  spies do not walk to moscow , i 'm not claiming that spying is n't a very real thing . 
  what i 'm claiming is that spies do not attempt to sneak across the border . 
  real spies are diplomats , and businessmen , occasionally journalists ( though this tends to really piss off real journalists ) . 
  this is n't capture the flag , you do n't walk across the russian border and then hitchhike to moscow . 
  you take a god damned airplane to moscow under some plausible pre-text for being there . 
  in this day and age does it seem probable that `` spies '' are literally sneaking across the estonian / russian border with 5k in cash ? 
  you do n't think it 's a lot more probable that a spy would n't take an international flight to moscow as a legitimate business person working for a western firm . 
  this is n't the cold war , russia is n't under a blockade people can and do go there all the time . 
  the idea that a spy would be sneaking across the russian border with cash and listening devices makes no sense . 
  this is obviously russia trying to fuck with the west and totally screwing this guy 's life in the process . 
  i take it you would no longer like to sell your cars , tarif free into the portuguese system right ? 
  because let 's not pretend that germany 's ability to pay the euro taxes are n't a ** major ** function of your export market access . 
  we the hard working germans owe the world nothing ( except for the fact that our entire economic system is dependent on outside consumption or it would collapse ) . 
  drop the sentiment , the 737 was an even is ( though to a lesser degree ) a wildly successful aircraft . 
  but it is now played out , and for a business the past does n't matter . 
  what matters is new orders , and in those terms the current 737 's are clearly in second place to the a320 's . 
  the 737 will go down in aviation history , and it will probably always be more famous and well known thanks to that venerable past . 
  but companies do n't run on good vibes and pleasant memories . 
  boeing is behind in this area and they sure as hell know it . 
  in a few years they 're going to answer the a320 with something brand new ( the yellowstone 1 project ) . 
  no way to know if that will come in the form of a standard aircraft with more composites and modernized systems like the 787 . 
  or if they 'll come out with some sort of truly revolutionary design to try to really recapture the market . 
  we will see . 
  they 're in a bad position in this one area ( the single aisle regional aircraft model ) . 
  in other areas they are much better positioned , specifically in the area of wide-body long range aircraft they 're in a much better spot than airbus . 
  the only airbus offering in this class is the a350 , and the only model of these which has strong sales is the a350-900 . 
  so far only they 've only delivered just a few of the things and it looks like increasing production will be a bit of a struggle in itself . 
  boeing by contrast has already delivered hundreds of 787-8/9 's . 
  and the 787 is indisputably the more advanced and ambitions aircraft , and all that newness came with its own costs / problems / delays / damages to image etc. 
  but the work has paid off and they 've certainly gained a lot of valuable experience that airbus is still lacking . 
  and then there 's the 777 which airbus clearly just has no real answer to . 
  it seems boeing learned its lesson with the 737 market share decline and they 've been a lot less complacent here . 
  for a very short time airbus seemed to be competitive with the 777 ( sort of ) with the a350-1000 . 
  but boeing quickly announced the 777x family and killed any hope of a long time edge for airbus . 
  then there 's the a380 and the 747-8 . 
  two aircraft that both seem pretty problematic . 
  as it increasingly seems that the age of the four engine mega-jet is nearing its end . 
  the a380 still has n't landed any orders this year and there are rumblings that the program could be facing cancellation . 
  which sucks big time for airbus and sucks less for boeing . 
  the a380 was obviously a much bigger investment than updating the old queen . 
  and thanks to its freight capability it seems that the 747-8 might have one leg left to stand on ( at least for now ) . 
  so while i think boeing has pretty well screwed the pooch in the narrow body single aisle category .
