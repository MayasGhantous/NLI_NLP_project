  overall i would rather be in boeing 's position than that of airbus . 
  in every area but the a320 v. 737 standoff airbus seems to be on the back foot . 
  and catching up is going to be a real struggle that 'll leave boeing an opportunity to catch up with whatever they 've got in mind for the yellowstone 1 project . 
  a320neo is squarely defeating the max in every market but the n. american ( and african market , which is only buying 31 of the class of planes in total ) . 
  airbus is beating out boeing by 16 % in total aircraft orders . 
  with a product like this that is a huge margin . 
  the 737 is a design which has been stretched way too far at this point , and everyone including boeing knows it . 
  they did n't really even want to build the max they wanted to skip this generation and go straight to the yellowstone 1 ( in a few years ) . 
  but airbus and angry customers forced an incremental update in the form of the max . 
  it 's stupid to directly compare total sales numbers between an aircraft available since 1967 ( 737 ) and an aircraft available since 1988 ( a320 ) . 
  it makes much more sense to compare market share and relevant numbers of sales since they were actually in competition . 
  and since they 've actually been in competition boeing went from a position of market dominance to a position 50 / 50 market share ** at best ** . 
  the a320 neo is out selling the 737 max in ** every market ** except for the american market . 
  and it 's hardly dominant there either . 
  boeing is definitely in a bad position in regards to single aisle aircraft . 
  they were very complacent for a long time to end up in the position they 're at now . 
  the a320 is just the better plane for the job and it has been for some time . 
  it 's a good think that boeing is managing to pretty effectively dominate the wide body long haul market with the 787 and 777x lines because the 737 max is in a very iffy place , they 'll basically get orders from long time 737 users who do n't want to switch . 
   in what criteria . 
  portuguese are my favorite europeans , you 've got all the things that make europe cool and interesting . 
  but crucially you do n't act like huge dicks about it all the time . 
  portugal has awesome food , awesome old buildings , a cool musical heritage , etc. 
  but you do n't act like everything you 've got and everything you do is fucking sacred . 
  also the level of cultural mixing and cohesion in portugal seems way more seamless and friendly than anywhere else in europe . 
  i 'm not sure if the portuguese are super nice and awesome . 
  or if they 're just too chill to use their energy on being dicks , either way portugal is awesome . 
  even the modern palestinian state as we understand it is a creation of outsiders . 
  people act like palestine 's shitty limbo status is purely a creation of israel and the west . 
  in reality you 've also got a ton of neighboring states that do n't really want to border israel and they also do n't want to deal with the dirt poor palestinians and their dysfunctional and dangerous `` governments '' . 
  palestine is less a country and more a group of people who 've gotten caught in a really shit situation between israel and a bunch of powers that do n't necessarily like israel but they also do n't really want to deal with palestine or the plaestinians . 
  well that 's hardcore ... i guess ? 
  more like it 's something i ca n't change , so if you do n't like it that 's fine . 
  but i 'm not going to change so if you do n't like my dick you might as well move on . 
  because it 's just one of those things , in the most literal sense . 
  meh , never had an issue with it , people are usually pretty considerate once everyone is naked . 
  i also really do n't give a shit , it 's just one of those things . 
  i would like to be taller than i am but i 'm not so i 'm not going to stress over it . 
  my tip is n't snipped and i 'm not going to get surgery for it , so why stress . 
  if someone does n't like it fine , but that 's your damage not mine . 
  american with full turtleneck , i 'm just here to make jokes about poncey europeans getting finicky about their cheese . 
  it 's not like they drilled a whole in it and fucked the wheel or anything . 
  it might be a bit of a stretch for one man even a very rich man to solve the problems of an entire continent . 
  we maybe should n't leave it all up to bill gates .

  well i 'm not the president but i think i would tell russia to fuck right off . 
  obama attempted a fresh start with russia , and for the attempt we got stabbed in the back . 
  russia and its leaders have earned at least a decade of american antagonism . 
  it 's almost like * most people * are just people , and even if muslim extremism is a problem it does not give anyone carte blanche rights to discriminate against them . 
  the problem of islamic terrorism is first and foremost a wildly exaggerated problem . 
  great , i 'm tired of trying to convince everyone we are n't the evil empire , let 's just go with it . 
  now where did i put that death star [ petition ] ( https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/isnt-petition-response-youre-looking ) . 
  blood for oil blood for oil !, 
  this happened then the russian government / oligarchs stole everyone 's money . 
  this belief that russia has been left out of the international system is ridiculous . 
  the west is notoriously bad at holding a grudge when there is money to be maid . 
  and there was a lot of money to be made working with russia . 
  and that would have had huge benefits for the russian system as well . 
  but pride and maybe paranoia seems to be more important to russia than acceptance into the community of nations . 
  you 've made yourselves the bad guy though you have little to nothing to gain by it . 
  he 's embarrassed by me because i 'm pointing out that nations are ultimately conglomeration of their citizens . 
  he does n't seem to understand that i 'm not literally suggesting that he personally overthrow russia 's government . 
  just that collectively russians ** are ** responsible for their nation . 
  either out of fear , apathy , or a sense of victim hood the situation in russia is on them . 
  trying to blame the leader is pretty ridiculous if the lead has a broad base of support than the people are to blame . 
  even if individual russians are nice people ( most individuals are pretty decent ) that does n't make them entirely innocent ( nor entirely guilty ) for their nations actions . 
  we all have some degree of responsibility , wether we accept it or not we 're responsible for what we do or do not do . 
  reading comprehension is why people like you make me embarrassed . 
  1 ) i voted , against him , did n't help but that 's a start . 
  2 ) i volunteered and campaigned against him . 
  3 ) i talked about it , an argued against his doctrines with other americans . 
  4 ) and most importantly * i did n't do much * , i could have done a lot more . 
  played fewer video games , masturbated less , watched less tv and fucked off with my friends a bit less . 
  i 'm not judging you for not spending all your time fighting putin . 
  i 'm not saying i 'm better than you , but what i am saying is * i am responsible * . 
  i 'm responsible for the time i sat around doing nothing at all when as a rich ( in practical terms ) kid with few responsibilities i had the ability to do so much more . 
  and that 's why i 'm responsible , i 'm responsible for what i do and what i do not do . 
  and i am responsible for my nation , maybe fractionally but i am responsible . 
  voting against bush does n't absolve me of that , doing what i did against him does n't absolve me . 
  it also does n't make me an awful person , but it is still my responsibility and i ca n't absolve myself of it just because i did n't personally like it . 
  my country , and it 's actions are my problem . 
  bush was n't that awful , maybe that 's something i should n't say in / r/europe but he was n't . 
  hell putin is n't that awful , neither of these people are hitler , they 're bad but historically speaking they 're bush league bad guys . 
  so how much of your life should you devote to combating levels of corruption and evil like this ? 
  i 'm honestly not sure , in the end the globe is pretty ok . bush fucked up some countries but he was hardly rounding up muslims for death camps . 
  and a lot of the shit that happened in the me was the result of tensions which likely would have boiled over at some point irregardless of his actions . 
  putin has fucked up some countries but if he wants to go further its pretty damn difficult , the rest of the world is pretty capable of putting a lid on things without firing a shot . 
  if you want to be apathetic about your country right now , trust me i get it and i do n't blame you . 
  just do n't claim that it is n't your responsibility , because it is . 
  how 'd you like it ? 
  i 'm a fan of freeman , think he goes a bit far with his predictions sometimes but at least he 's willing to make them . 
  better to make a prediction and be wrong then to always babble incoherently about minor details in such a diluted manner than no one can actually evaluate your analysis . 
  my grand parents arrived in the united states long after the end of slavery and not even that long before the establishment of equal rights . 
  that does n't mean that i am absolved from collective responsibility , were are members of nations and not just our own people . 
  just because the current situation is n't your fault does n't mean it 's not your responsibility . 
  the people of russia have a responsibility for the actions of their nation , if fear or apathy keeps them in check while the elites run amok i can sympathize . 
  but it 's still your responsibility , russians have died and been imprisoned fighting the corruption of your current leaders . 
  i hold the russian people responsible for their nation , you may not like it but that 's how things are . 
  and i do n't like it when people shield themselves from criticism by saying `` well i did n't vote for him '' . 
  i did n't vote for bush , does n't matter , still my responsibility , i 'm not absolved and neither is any other american . 
  that bomb looks like shit , anyone ever heard of regular maintenance ?
