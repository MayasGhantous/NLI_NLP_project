  tldr : if volkswagen is unable to come up with a plausible excuse for the existence of a defeat device it is likely this will not end with fines . 
  regardless of their reasoning they will face civil penalties for violations of the clean air act ( 18 billion potential , not including civil cases filed by individuals , and not including epa fines levied against individuals ) . 
  if they can not come up with a plausible excuse they are likely to face charges of wire fraud , false statements to regulators ( they told the epa that no defeat device existed for about a year ) , as well as a number of other potential charges . 
  this would mean not just a fine but actual prison time . 
  it 'll be interesting to see if germany is willing to extradite executives to the united states . 
  and if they are not it 'll be interesting to see how the u.s. government responds , they have plenty of cards to play against the german government . 
  diesel engines run far hotter and at far higher pressures than an average gasoline engine . 
  pressure and heat both cause engine ware , they are basically less reliable across the board . 
  also tuning them to run clean makes the even hotter , which further reduces longevity . 
  have you been to america ? 
   in the us , federal agents would storm the state , tear down fences on the border , jail state officials who are not complying and they would start enforcing this themselves , sending the bill to the state that rebels . 
  ummmmm , well * not quite * , if a law or any sort of action were enacted by the legislature or the executive branch a state would have the opportunity to contest that law or executive order on constitutional grounds . 
  they would file a claim in the united states court of federal claims ( i believe that 's the one , there are several ) . 
  during the period prior to the hearing their would typically be a judicial stay on the execution of any new laws or orders . 
  after the claim was heard and decided both parties would have an opportunity to appeal the verdict . 
  this would kick the issue up into * one of * the appeals courts ( there are several but the one where you 're heard depends on where you are i believe ) . 
  here the case is re-heard and the validity of the first court ruling is considered . 
  ** after that ** there is a second opportunity to appeal the results of the ruling , this time to the united states supreme court . 
  the supreme court justices are not obligated to hear all requested cases , they are permitted to briefly review each case which has already been through this process . 
  and if they do not consider the complaint about the appeals court ruling that ruling is basically made final and that 's the end of it . 
  but if the supreme court does decide to hear a case then you go before the supreme court and plead ( on constitutional grounds ) your reasoning behind a law and / or your opposition to said law . 
  if the supreme court decides that the law a state was protesting against ** is ** constitutional than the state and state officials are required to comply with that law . 
  if they do not comply with the law then the previously mentioned federal agents kicking down the door / people going to jail / etc. 
  because under u.s. law these people are now considered to be in criminal violation of the law . 
  what 's interesting thing is that due to this structure sometimes creating a law or bringing a case against a law can have the exact opposite impact that you 're looking for . 
  for example in a sense anti-gay marriage advocates were basically responsible for the ultimate `` legalization '' of gay marriage in the united states . 
  ohio by refusing to recognize the marriage of a gay couple initiated in another state . 
  they opened the door to have claim brought against them for failing to recognize a legal marriage from another state . 
  when this case after the previous process ( took about two years ) reached the supreme court and was heard and decided . 
  the decision of the court did n't so much make gay marriage legal as it considered gay marriage to have been legal since 1868 when the 14th amendment ( the equal protection clause ) was made law . 
  because it is the supreme courts decision to rule on law as it applies directly to the constitution . 
  they 're rulings define the status of legality in regard to the absolute law of the land ( the united states constitution ) which can not be subverted by law makers . 
  so at this point there is basically nothing that any legislature or president can do to repeal gay marriage . 
  because it is now guaranteed as a fundamental right under the law of the land . 
  really the only way to change the law at this point would be to amend the constitution which is ** very very ** hard , because it requires a 2/3 vote by congress or the senate to propose . 
  then the legislatures in 75 % of the states have to vote on and approve an amendment . 
  so for an amendment to pass it requires very broad federal and state support . 
  politics in america at the moment is pretty damned partisan so until that changes the odds of any amendment being passed are approximately nil . 
   again : we only have the epas word for the alleged confession of vw . 
  dude are you ** fucking serious ** ?!, 
  http://www.nytimes.com/video/business/international/100000003928968/volkswagen-we-have-totally-screwed-up.html that is the president of volkswagen america . 
  what more do you need ? 
  edit : and here 's the article i quoted if you 're too fucking daft to google that shit yourself . 
  do n't cheat , just pay the fine , have your government investigate the volkswagen 's sold in the country . 
  fine volkswagen for vehicles that are in violation of those standards . 
  pay the eu fines for not accepting refugees with that money , keep the change . 
  fyi : i personally do n't have a problem with immigration but i 'm feeling a bit annoyed with vw at the moment . 
  so if they want to fine you for violating eu rules you should fine vw for violating eu rules , seems only fare . 
   they are . 
  well buy all you can then , no one is stopping you , we have a saying here `` put your money where your mouth is '' . 
  no reason to argue with me if you think i 'm wrong , especially if you 're not even going to raise interesting points . 
   they can impose reasonable fines of upto that amount . 
  any amount will be fought in court and we only have the epas word for vws confession . 
  uhhh no they have grounds to levy fines equal to the value of every vehicle sold on the company . 
  they also have the legal right to levy fines on individuals responsible up to 1/10th that amount . 
  what is unreasonable about requesting the maximum fines when the environmental protection act has been intentionally violated for the last seven years . 
  and when volkswagen spent the last years lying to the epa and only came clean when they outright refused to allow import of their newest models into the country . 
  seems pretty reasonable to me , you want to sell products in america do n't intentionally violate our laws and then lie about it when you get caught with your pants down ( this is analogy to fucking someone else wife , capeesh ? ) . 
   only have the epas word for vws confession . 
  dude i know you 're probably really bummed that your granny and grandpappy are n't going to be able to retire yet . 
  but the mother fucking ceo of the mother fucking company has admitted to what happened . 
   i am infinitely sorry that we have disappointed people 's trust . 
  i offer my deepest apologies to our customers , the authorities and to the public at large for our misconduct , '' the 68-year-old executive said in a video statement and promised to be `` ruthless '' in getting to the bottom of the scandal . 
   but the american market is n't nearly as important as you believe . 
  hmm well the american economy is 22 % of the world economy . 
  so i guess what i believe that in economic terms the united states market is about as important as more than 1/5th of the world economy . 
  in terms of the u.s. / german trade relationship for example the german exports to the united states ( minus imports ) is equivalent to about 1.9 % of ** the total german economy ** . 
  while in absolute terms ( without subtracting imports ) 3.15 % of the german economy is totally dependent on american exports . 
  by contrast the american total exports to germany annually make up less than three tenths of a percent of our total economy . 
  that important enough for you ? 
  well if that 's what you believe i hope you 're putting every penny you 've got in to vw stock . 
  they 're down 40 % at the moment , so if that 's all it 's going to cost they 're an insane bargain right now . 
  of course even volkswagen has set aside considerably more than that and they 've said `` this is just a start '' . 
  of course you have n't offered a single justification on why you believe this to be the case . 
  they have a legal right to purse a 18 billion dollar fine , for a blatant crime that vw has already admitted to . 
  why are they settling for two billion ? 
  where does vw get the leverage to pull of a 90 % reduction in fines ? 
  all of this happening at a time where there is a lot of public resentment against corporate crime . 
  and the justice department has released a public memo signaling their attention to pursue these crimes far more aggressively . 
  add to all that the fact that volkswagen is arguing from a shitty , ** shitty ** position . 
  this was n't a mistake it was a willful intent to violate environmental protection law , ** and ** to defraud customers . 
  they 're going to get zero public sympathy , not just from americans but from just about everyone else . 
  the u.s. government is looking to score points for being tough on corporate crime and this is a slam dunk . 
  and volkswagen trying to hit back in any sort of substantive way is going to make them look bad , and possibly elicit and even worse american response . 
  they need the american market a lot more than the american market needs volkswagen . 
  wrong sort of emission , diesels are more efficient and so are actually better for global warming . 
  the problem is they burn very dirty compared to gasoline powered cars . 
  the sorts of emissions from diesel engines are nitrogen oxides and soot . 
  in terms of global warming this stuff is n't really a huge problem . 
  but ( and here 's the crux of the issue ) they do cause major acute environmental and health problems . 
  when you 're talking about smog the problem is n't co2 . 
  the reason the united states and specifically california led the way on this is because we drive a lot more than europeans . 
  there are only a couple of cities in the united states where you can really live without a car . 
  most americans drive , and we drive a lot . 
  the definition of a long road trip can literally be the daily commute of an american worker . 
  so in major cities like los angeles which is pretty much 100 % car transport driven . 
  smog , ozone , became a huge problem , which was the motivation behind the extremely strict emissions standards . 
  and it worked , this is n't like global warming a chronic problem which has been developing for more than a century . 
  this is an acute problem that has actually been largely corrected by these regulations . 
  due to the nature of how engines and fuel works it 's very hard to build diesels which can meet these standards .
