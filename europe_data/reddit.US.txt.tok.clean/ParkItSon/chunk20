  are we suggesting that this move is in any way rational ? 
  are we talking casualty counts or the cause of ww2 ? 
  because if we 're talking about the pacific theater we 're really talking about an almost totally separate conflict , tagged onto the european war for matters of convenience . 
  japan was opportunistic , they took advantage of the situation in europe to split the forces of their primary foes ( mainly the united states and great britain ) . 
  if europe had managed to forge a sustainable peace agreement it is possible that war in the pacific may never have occurred or would have been far more limited . 
  as japan fighting an un-distracted foe would have been in a far worse position , which the japanese knew well . 
   because often they only have been attacked yeah that 's kind of the crux of it , we can argue about total casualty counts if you want . 
  but the essential point is that the world wars * were * european wars . 
  germany may have been the primary aggressor but there is culpability across the board . 
  arrogance , callousness , apathy , and even a good dose of vindictiveness were to blame . 
  and that attitude can still be seen today , this desire to continue failing policies at great human cost because determining who is `` responsible '' is more important than finding a solution that works . 
  an arrogance that those who have lost everything should just grin and bare it because `` ultimately it 's their fault , and if that means a generation or generations of poverty too bad '' . 
  a dismissive attitude that there is no serious danger in persistent state of depression across huge swathes of europe . 
  is there going to be another major war in europe ? 
  i very much doubt it , so much has changed that such a situation seems basically impossible today . 
  but the arrogance comes in not taking the problem seriously enough , in not looking beyond national feelings on a issue and trying to find a broader / better solution . 
  in not understanding that we live in a complex and sometimes dangerous world where no one can be sure of what the next global impact disaster might be . 
  in europe i do not see the desire to find solutions for problems if those solutions are too costly , or too politically difficult . 
  the current state of affairs just may be enough to maintain stability today , but no one knows what tomorrow brings . 
  right you 've just had the largest and bloodiest wars in world history , but the americans are the warmongers . 
  like i said , pretend like nothing ever happened . 
  did you know we faked the moon landing ? 
   we 're just more civilised . 
  looks at european history ...  more civilised takes another look at european history . 
   more civilised thinks for a second , hahahahahahahahaha , you have got to be kidding me . 
  europeans never cease to amaze me with their arrogance . 
  i recall a quote i once heard by a hungarian jew who had immigrated to the united states after the world wars and after the cold war began . 
  who always felt there was a corruption the european soul . 
  `` the europeans will never change , they 'll just pretend like nothing ever happened '' . 
  and it strikes as shamefully true , you think you can have economic war without real war . 
  you time and time again ignore your own histories and maintain this this shocking arrogance . 
  if europe right now resembles pre-civil war u.s. politics and you ca n't come to a resolution without war ( so far no good and no indication of improvements ) . 
  then a real war is coming , economics are not a substitute , if you push people to far than real blood shed will come next . 
  people do not roll over and die when there is no hope for them , they lash out and that is how wars happen . 
  might be less meaningful to a spanish famer having his product incinerated by french farmers . 
  i 'm a bit confused i thought you were implying that we could offer massive military aid and even direct support to ukraine and it would n't be in the media ? 
  what i 'm saying is that ca n't happen . 
  edit : oh just realized your original comment said do ** not ** i missed the not part . 
  we 're in agreement then . 
  yeah because we know europe wo n't and ca n't effectively project power into central asia . 
  france is the most militarily independent and capable european country and they can barely pull off any operation without american logistic and command and control assistance . 
  but if it 's ** on your own fucking continent ** europe does have the ability to act and apply meaningful pressure . 
  that does n't mean you will , getting europe to get behind anything is like herding cats . 
  but it 's something you 're certainly capable of . 
  yes we control the media so well that major government scandals do n't ever become front page stories for years on end . 
  cough nsa cough . 
  well according to europa.eu , basically all the time as its a council of elected officials from various nations . 
  we 've elected people to govern us , if we 're not going to trust them to do that then what 's the point ? 
  i guarantee you that in this day and age there is a vocal and enraged group vehemently opposed to any and every new piece of significant legislation . 
  either our political process grinds to a halt or laws may be passed ( in accordance with the law ) without an exhaustive airing of personal grievances of the public . 
  yes , it matters a lot because size is essentially the main danger in the american wilderness . 
  odds are that nothing is going to kill you , the biggest risk is that you 'll get lost and you wo n't find your way out before dehydration / hunger / exposure kills you . 
  the most dangerous factor is size and emptiness , in europe proper ( the areas where europeans actually live ) there 's so little danger from the elements . 
  and basically no danger of becoming lost and unable to find help . 
  in the states places which are considered well inhabited are extremely rural . 
  if you go for an impromptu trek through on some european trail without bothering to prepare it is ** very ** unlikely that you 'll get into trouble . 
  not so in the states and especially not in the southwest . 
  this is hardly an isolated incident , and unfortunately it is foreigners from high density countries who die at a disproportionate rate . 
  experienced hikers taking precautions get into trouble pretty regularly , do n't treat this like a nice hike through an austrian forest , these things are nothing alike . 
  normally i 'm pretty un-impressed by the european claims of moral superiority over the states . 
  but this i can get behind , our prison system is a god damned joke . 
  an international boycott over extraditing to the u.s. would hopefully bring attention to the issue . 
  buh buh buh , we flout global law and demand compliance from all others . 
  the circle jerk told me so ... 
  pot , meet kettle . 
  but let 's be honest that 's including the russian part of europe where just about no one goes . 
  so i was talking more in the practical sense , the european peninsula is a great place but there 's no true wild land . 
  its more that on the maps we mostly look at the sizes are mostly wrong . 
  europe is n't a little smaller than the u.s. 
  it 's ** a lot ** smaller . 
  so it 's pretty easy to mis-interpret if you look at the average global map . 
  hola brother , i too am a pi\u00f1ata stuffed with green chile . 
  seriously though , psa for european tourists . 
  1 ) the united states is ** big ** 2 ) the population density is extremely low , the european definition of extremely rural is pretty damn dense compared to the states , especially nm . 
  3 ) it is hot , it is dry and it is also high altitude . 
  all of this means extremely high rate of water loss as well as uv skin damage . 
  4 ) it can also be damn cold , high altitude , low humidity , little to no surface water , interior state , means that the temperature extremes can be huge . 
  do not fuck around in the american west , that fun little hike you 're planning is not a joke . 
  you are not going to find a man with his cows on top of that mountain . 
  ** even if ** you find a road there is no guarantee that road sees more than a tiny handful of vehicles every year . 
  we have fire access roads for example , no one uses on a regular basis for anything . 
  if you 're spending any time in the american wilderness pay attention to the locals . 
  never `` wing it '' , make a plan and bring what you need . 
  serious and well prepared hikers get lost and die ** all the time ** , this is n't a fun little hike to take with your kid . 
  i 'm not saying the american wilderness is one big death zone , but this is n't something to wander into with no thought . 
  it is quite easy to get for real lost , even in places which are a lot less hostile than white sands you can quite easily get lost and die . 
  do n't go alone , tell someone where you 're going and when to expect you back , remember this is the for real wilderness . 
  you 're probably not going to stumble across anyone or anything , if you get into trouble you 're on your own . 
  other than that have fun , but the wilds of europe and the united states are not even a little equal . 
  so keep that in mind . 
  seriously ? 
  i guess i lived through it but i was a baby . 
  there is literally no concrete reason for the falklands dispute , no oil , no fishing rights , nothing . 
  the british were even thinking of signing it over to argentina a couple of years before the war broke out . 
  but the falklands representatives were strongly opposed . 
  it 's just a sovereignty thing , argentina thinks it belongs to them and the british and more than 90 % of falkland 's residents disagree . 
  there 's nothing to be done about it , argentina should be ignored and if they invade they should be kicked squarely in the teeth . 
  talking in the case is a complete waste of time . 
  i 'm not being defeatist , if the argentinian government decides to invade the falklands you just need to kill people until they stop . 
  if the argentinian people do n't want that they need to deal with ** their ** government .
