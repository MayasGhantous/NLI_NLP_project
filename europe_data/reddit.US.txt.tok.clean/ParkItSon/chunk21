  pretty straight forward , by defeatist you mean i do n't see a diplomatic solution than you 're right . 
  because the fallklands is n't a diplomatic issue , it 's not supremely rich in resources or anything . 
  the people there have voted and they overwhelmingly want to remain part of the commonwealth . 
  the falklands is a non-issue there is no discussion to be had and no compromises to be made . 
  talking and negotiating is great , for example i applaud the recent iran deal . 
  but in that negotiations there were things that both sides wanted and they were willing to move on . 
  there 's no negotiation to be had over the falklands the issue is settled and if argentina ca n't accept that then the only solution is to kick them in the head until they stop moving . 
  it 's not an echo chamber the argentinian government is well aware that they 're being ridiculous . 
  it 's just an attempt to distract from their shit policy and governance decisions my stirring up nationalist fervor . 
  there 's no point to a dialogue , they do n't want a dialogue . 
   ** a bunch of ** nationalist dicks well i think you answered your own question , it 's hardly a fringe opinion in hungary . 
  i was only there for a couple of weeks and i got an earful about transylvanians opinions of their nationality . 
  as a country hungary is n't a neighbor i 'd harbor a lot of trust for . 
  the persistent attitude of victimhood is a bit worrying . 
  in my experience the people ( and countries ) who 've always got someone else to blame for their problems are the ones to worry about . 
  and hungarians have a serious problem when it comes to finding outsiders to blame for your problems . 
   reserving your spot with a towel is good etiquette . 
  how could this * possibly * be good etiquette . 
  as far as i understand etiquette is generally about public politeness / being considerate . 
  i think most etiquette stuff is pretty bullshit , but still that 's the general concept as i understand it . 
  reserving a spot for yourself just does n't make any sense in terms of etiquette . 
  i mean it 's not like you 're helping anyone but yourself . 
  this might be considered acceptable some places , but etiquette , hell no . 
  that 's like trying to claim that reserving a parking place for yourself with a cone is good etiquette . 
  i guess i just do n't go to crowded beaches or beaches with infrastructure ( see tiki huts and lawn chairs ) . 
  but i 've never really been on a beach that 's so crowded i felt there was a real need to reserve space . 
  or maybe i do n't mind walking a distance to get to the open . 
  but yeah i could see it being really annoying if people were reserving space on a really crowded beach , or on lawn chair thingies . 
  as long as you consider a subsidy rate of approximately 1/3rd the the european subsidy rate then yes they are about the same . 
  but in my eyes a 300 % higher subsidies are not insignificant . 
  well factory farming ** is ** way more efficient than a group long of many small farmers working at a small scale . 
  this is just fact , basic economies of scale stuff . 
  i personally like small farming models because i think they are typically much more sane , sustainable , and humane that factory farming . 
  also the food is just better , small producers make amazing food with a lot more variety . 
  but even this is much less economical , if you focus on quality instead of say shelf life / transportability / efficiency you have a less competitive product . 
  ultimately i think people are going to vote with their wallets . 
  in the u.s. we had ** decades ** of shitty mass produced crap . 
  now people are getting really tired of it and were shifting slowly back towards a quality  quantity and marketability model . 
  but that 's ultimately the result of people voting with their wallet . 
  that food costs more but it turns out that people are perfectly willing to pay more for better food . 
  in europe you 're either going to have to implement protectionism , establish government subsidies so steep that they 'll probably violate trade agreements ( not to mention angering all non farmers ) , or people will have to pay more for locally produced high quality products . 
  pick one of the three . 
  not always true , sometimes falling demand in certain market places can force you to lower product prices . 
  if those reduced prices indie people who were n't previously purchasing products to sample some and if they then go on to enjoy the product and buy more . 
  then you 've expanded your market into new areas . 
  standard loss leader stuff , reduce price to gain market penetration which persists even after prices are hiked . 
  not saying this is what happened but real life business performance is n't as simple as `` grow market , more sales '' . 
  it 's perfectly possible that an initially negative development creates an inadvertent opportunity somewhere else . 
  because in real world economies many factors influence consumer behavior and market access . 
  they 're already a part of the eu , but as things stand the eu is n't that much more than a glorified free trade agreement ( rabble rabble , i get it you have a flag ) . 
  the eurozone on the other hand is a ** very ** different animal . 
  the eurozone is pushing into the territory of being a pseudo nation . 
  but it is n't entirely clear that these nations want to be a nation . 
  the member states want the benefits of being a nation without the unfortunate costs and pitfalls of truly tying your destiny to another group of people . 
  crashing prices and it increasingly seems crashing demand in china , russia is in a tight spot . 
  i really do n't understand what russia had to gain from any of this . 
  for years they 've been in a strong position to work with and profit from work with the west . 
  but again and again they hobble themselves for what ? 
  to maintain sovereignty / strength / independence ? 
  all things which slip further from their grasp with each resounding fuck up . 
  maybe at the end of the day it 's as simple as corrupt leadership who have more to lose with an inclusive / open / and relatively corruption free system . 
  than they have to gain by being true leaders with a desire to improve the lives of their people . 
  still it strikes me as strange , would n't a smaller yacht and a sense of pride in helping your nation and your people be a worthy trade off ? 
  but as things stand poland has a limited ability to shape those rules . 
  poland has a ton of potential but potential and the current reality are different things . 
  poland ca n't waltz its way into the euro and start dictating policy , it might be a heavyweight one day but it is n't one yet . 
  poland joining today does n't give it an opportunity to shape the euro , it mostly just surrenders control that poland already has . 
  i would n't caught dead joining a program like the euro until at least a partial fiscal minion is formed . 
  this one size fits all monetary policy is very * very * risky in a conglomeration with such varied economic models / capacities . 
  poland is doing great they 've got strong trade ties with their neighbors and they 've got control of their own monetary policy . 
  i see very little advantage for poland in giving up that control . 
  especially noting how poorly europe has managed since the crisis . 
  instead what they got is a poignant demonstration of just how bad things are getting for many russian citizens . 
  yes , us americans are notoriously stingy with out defense spending ( rolls eyes ) . 
  you understand that there 's a difference between wanting a system of government with a higher degree of socialization and more of a social safety net . 
  and literally saying `` competitiveness is an absolutely atrocious concept '' ? 
  competition is critical to innovation , progress , and improvement the alternative is stagnation and eventual destruction . 
  there 's a reason that the same animals which existed 50 million years ago no longer exist today , * here 's a hint * its because of constant competition and the survival of the most well adapted . 
  i guess the reason the soviet empire collapsed was because of the atrocious and pernicious effects of competition . 
  do n't make me laugh . 
   `` competitiveness '' is an absolutely atrocious concept and it baffles me why it is even popular . 
  seriously ? 
  because competition produces amazing results . 
  when people are competitive they 're always seeking an edge . 
  occasionally yes this can lead to declines in worker salary , though that is generally indicative of an over abundance of that type of worker . 
  but without competition there is literally no incentive to improve just about anything . 
  after all nothing that you do will allow you to be more successful than anyone else , so why bother ? 
  no it does n't , there is no way to just * magically * make free money , there is never a free lunch . 
  the more money you print the higher the rate of inflation , since coins necessitate a higher rate of seignorage . 
  higher rate of seignorage means a higher inflation rate , higher inflation means the de-valuation of existing currency . 
  which is generally good for a government ( high inflation de-values existing government debt ) and bad for citizens . 
  people wo n't complain it 's mostly not a big deal , but in the ** real life examples ** where they have made this change ( in the uk and canada ) they ended up need to make 1.6 coins to replace every equivalent value bill in real life . 
  this is n't an anecdote or my personal opinion , it 's actual statistical data from countries which altered portions of their currency from bills to coins . 
  it * generally speaking * costs the government significantly less to make a unit of denomination than that denomination is worth . 
  ie * the materials and labor required to make a $ 100.00 dollar bill are worth considerably less than $ 100.00 . 
  so i think we can agree that making money is quite a profitable business . 
  but unfortunately there is no such thing as free money , even if you 're allowed to print the stuff . 
  someone will always be on the hook , since the government must print 60 % more coins than equivalent bills to meet circulation demand . 
  that means the government gets to make more money ( because like i said before making money is a profitable business ) . 
  but there is no free lunch , so whose on the hook for all the extra money the government just earned ?
