  citizens are that 's who , because people ** do ** use coins less ( not my opinion but an actual observed fact in comparable real life situations ) . 
  coins spend more time sitting around and thus do less for people with coins . 
  because you 're not buying things with that money , or investing it , you 're losing money due to inflation . 
  and here is where the no free lunch rule is satisfied , because it turns out that you 're for all intents and purposes paying the government with all the money you are n't using or investing . 
  sure it 's not a tax , it 's just a way for the government to generate money for itself at the expense of citizens . 
  so totally not a tax ... 
  except that the coins between the couch cushions and in sitting in jars . 
  necessitate a significantly higher percentage of currency in circulation to maintain the same level of liquidity . 
  thus significantly increasing the seigniorage rate . 
  try to grasp i 'm not making a dire prediction i 'm talking about a very small and very subtle change in how people behave . 
  people will and do obviously use coins , an economy run entirely with coins would work just fine . 
  this does not change the fact that coins spend more time in limbo than do bills . 
  this means that a small but not insignificant tax is collected by the currency issuer ( in a sense ) . 
  if you do n't understand please listen to the podcast linked above . 
  what do you mean `` that has n't happened '' it 's not something that happens it 's just something that is true . 
  if you raise taxes then people will pay more taxes , if you use coins for currency instead of bills they 'll spend more time sitting around . 
  this is a lot like a secret tax , it is n't going to crash the economy or anything . 
  but it does and it will and it ** has ** happened . 
  they 've studied how people behave with coins vs. bills and across the board people use coins less . 
  coins are just annoying to use , even if the coins are worth a significant amount they 're basically impossible to organize . 
  nobody wants to ruffle through their pocket / change purse looking for the right coins . 
  so they do n't , the coins build up and eventually people say fuck it and toss them in a jar . 
  coins are far more easily lost / misplaced , so what you end up with is a lot of money just sitting around doing nothing . 
  in terms of anyone individual this is pretty meaningless , but if you 're talking about a hundreds of millions of people , well that 's a lot of couch cushions . 
  salk was working for a public institution , not investing his private wealth in the development . 
  but i take your point . 
  i 'm of the opinion that research that is the result of public funding should have certain restrictions on its use . 
  off the top of my head there should be some price controls , and there should be regulations against sitting on / hoarding patents which come about as the result of public funding . 
  coins save * the government * money , in the same way that raising taxes `` saves '' the government money . 
  people do n't like coins , coins end up sitting around in jars because nobody wants to carry around bags full of metal . 
  any money not actively being used saves the government money ( or more accurately causes you to essentially * pay * a secret tax ) . 
  http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/11/29/166103071/no-killing-the-dollar-bill-would-not-save-the-government-money keep your valuable coins if you want but they 're a god damned nightmare and i hope that u.s. citizens keep making a stink when they try to abolish the dollar . 
  these programs are * in large part * about fostering native industrial capability and talent . 
  it would probably be cheaper to buy all of the aircraft a country needs from the states . 
  but at the cost of eventually killing the native ability to develop and build your own equipment . 
  if you do n't want to be forever beholding to u.s. manufacturing investing in these programs ( even if they 're never profitable ) seems reasonable to me . 
  being independent and self reliant is a very valuable commodity in its own right . 
  come to new york , shit ( both literal and figurative ) ** everywhere ** , god i love it . 
  i do n't have the slightest problem with airbus , i 'm glad that there are multiple companies competing and forcing each other to improve . 
  i just take exception the to the belief that the u.s. is somehow implementing overbearing restrictions to damage airbus sales in the united states . 
  because what , the faa placed a restriction on supersonic aircraft flying over populated regions ? 
  because the faa raised some minor concerns about turbulence and airport capacity / capability relating to the largest commercial airliner ever built ? 
  it 's just a silly thing to say , the a380 and the concorde both had / have major problems regarding their commercial viability . 
  and those problems are totally un-related to any actions taken by the faa . 
  well then i guess we 're lucky that airbus 's massive production delays gave everyone a cushion to work out the regulatory issues and place new orders before this had a major material impact . 
  the real problem with the a380 is that it is an airplane for a model of air travel which is being rapidly phased out . 
  on top of all of that the a380 was ** never ** going to be used heavily within the united states . 
  this was an issue for a few major hub airports which were always going to find a way to make it work . 
  a380 's were never going to be used for internal domestic flights , just like the 747 never was . 
  is your example of the u.s. `` stifling european countries '' seriously an example of an internal discussion within the faa which eventually led to the jet being allowed to operate without restrictions ? 
  so basically you 're complaint is that the faa had the audacity to raise questions of safety and airport redesign as it applied to the introduction of a new significantly larger aircraft than had been operated before ? 
  even though all of these issues were adequately worked out by the time the a380 made its first flight ? 
  if this is truly an american policy stifling competition with european businesses i 'm fucking ashamed that we are n't better at it . 
  ** faa ) ** we 're concerned that this new aircraft may present some safety concerns we 'd like to address ** ab ) ** we 've looked into your concerns and addressed them and considering previous agreements with other organizations we feel our designs meet safety requirements . 
  ** faa ) ** alright you 'll be allowed to operate without restrictions , though some modifications may be required to ensure that airports can adequately accommodate these aircraft . 
  * the horror * ... 
  do n't get too excited , i do n't disagree with you , and i 'm not make an argument that the u.s. tax code could n't be tweaked in big ways that i would approve of . 
  i think wealth inequality is a huge problem in the states and across much of the globe . 
  but ultimately even a progressive tax on income wo n't change this . 
  because the largest problems with global inequality concern wealth , not taxable income . 
  to meaningfully re-adjust you 'd need to seriously consider a tax on accumulated capital . 
  but there 's a problem with this , mainly that taxing accumulated capital would spur ** massive ** capital flight to whichever nations offered no tax on capital . 
  creating a wealth tax would then require a global effort in order to extract that tax . 
  considering the currently iffy relations within the eu implementing such a tax would be difficult . 
  and unfortunately increased tax on income ( even a huge increase ) would have a minimal effect on national tax coffers and thus a minimal impact on the national ability to provide services . 
  the only realistic way to currently fund programs like these would be wide reaching tax increases across the population ( not just on the rich or the super rich ) . 
  there is a great deal of wealth inequality but a much smaller degree of income inequality . 
  recommended reading on the subject would be `` capital in the 21st century '' by thomas piketty , he 's a frenchman so hopefully that 'll assuage your fears of an american argument cop out . 
  got ta say it looks like he did n't realize that mound of dirt was there . 
  that could have been bad . 
  i have some delays with departures , arrivals are mostly on point . 
  i 'm not universally opposed to violent protest , i just think competition with spanish poultry farmers is n't much justification . 
  being literally murdered by the police , seems like a fairly sound reason to protest violently ( even though this may not be the most effective method ) . 
   was the engine even invented yet ? 
  yes  how many tanks were involved in that war ? 
  none  are you fucking kidding me with this self masturbation tripe ? 
  do i think it would ever happen ? 
  obviously not , do i think that 300 million guns and hundreds of millions of armed americans would be a concern for any invading force ? 
  oh yeah , for some reason people seem to imagine that tanks / aircraft just negate the problem of infantry resistance . 
  but last time i checked the united states , with the most powerful technologically advanced , well trained , well equipped forces in the world . 
  had one hell of a hard time pacifying iraq , a nation of some 30 million people , mostly equipped with decades old soviet tech . 
  the swiss are n't all armed to the teeth for no reason , in rough terrain a few million well armed / well trained people with guns is just a massive ** massive ** problem . 
  unless you 're willing to just nuke the place flat 10 's of millions of armed citizens is a fucking nightmare for any invading force . 
  let me know when someone invades switzerland and i 'll rescind my views . 
  funny i seem to remember massive riots and protests across many major u.s. cities , and a few cops being literally shot . 
  sorry , meant surplus . 
   you mean kind of like the american states who are now debating banning the confederate flag . 
  nobody was debating banning the confederate flag . 
  what was being debated was removing the flag and variations of the flag from public buildings . 
  literally ** no one ** has suggested that having or displaying the flag would be in any way made illegal . 
  as this would be a blatant violation of the first amendment . 
   when have americans ever protested against their government in the way many europeans often do ? 
  you mean where you burn cars and destroy people 's private property because the wrong team won at soccer ? 
  yeah we do n't call that a protest , that 's a riot . 
  the shit that french taxi drivers pulled in paris recently would absolutely not be tolerated in the united states . 
   you do n't trust your government on things they should be distrusted on , ok , but you also do n't trust your government enough to have high taxes and strong social services . 
  that 's less about trust and more about different economic theories and opinions on the role of government . 
  germany has very high taxes and a very strong social services . 
  they also have a very weak consumer base and an unsustainably high trade surplus . 
  not all countries can be germany or the global economy would t work .
