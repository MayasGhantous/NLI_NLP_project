  americas largely consumer driven economy is dependent on people having lower taxes and higher disposable income as a result . 
  i 'm not saying one system is better than the other , i 'm saying that there are reasons beyond trust in the government which shape economic policy . 
  edit : deficit to surplus, 
   what do you think you are going to do against a well armed army that does n't give a crap about killing your whole town just because you pulled a gun . 
  there are very few army 's which are armed better than the american people . 
  the last armed incursions onto u.s. soil ended in more aggressor deaths than residents . 
  basically an invasion of the u.s. would mean combatting over 100 million heavily armed , extremely pissed off , americans . 
  fuuuuccccck jfk tsa clearance , if you 've got the option fly to newark , it 's way faster and the tsa agents are way less douchey too . 
  uhhh ok i guess we just woke up one day and we were the world 's lone superpower ? 
  that could n't possibly have any relation to 100 's of years of industrial development and innovation . 
  hundreds of years of political innovation , internal political conflict , moral struggles , managing to peacefully integrate 100 's of millions of people into one nation . 
  one nation with the ability to truly act as a whole unit when we desire ? 
  a nation which operates with an impressive degree of unity while also offering a great deal of personal freedom . 
  the u.s. did n't just get the superpower key one day . 
  to be where we are today is a major achievement . 
  i 'm not talking about disaster relief , i 'm talking about things like : 1 ) global access to shipping lanes , which is primarily ensured by the us navy . 
  most countries do not have and can not afford to field a blue water navy capable of defending their own shipping interests . 
  the united states provides this service at an ** enormous ** discount to the rest of the world . 
  we protect basically all world shipping including shipping un-related to transactions between any us or us linked interests . 
  this is unprecedented in modern history . 
  2 ) all of the wars which * do not happen * because the us acts a stabilizing force . 
  there are no shortage of nations which are basically at each other 's throats . 
  it just so happens that in many cases the united states is aligned / has close diplomatic ties with * both * of them . 
  across most of the world wars as we used to conceive of them basically do not happen . 
  since the rise of the us as a superpower the world has experienced its longest and most substantial peace in human history . 
  and that in no small part relates to the fact that the united states is willing to step in between countries like greece and turkey and say ** no ** . 
  when europe is basically incapable of developing a unified foreign policy stance on , well just about anything . 
  i 'm not suggesting that the united states goes out and feeds all of the hungry . 
  but as the most powerful coherent force ( in economic , political , and military terms ) in the modern world . 
  it 's ridiculous to suggest that the current modern order is not heavily shaped by us . 
  and that order has managed to create a more peaceful / prosperous / and equitable world than has ever existed in human history . 
  that in my eyes at least is a significant accomplishment . 
  the same can be said of all human beings , at all times , everywhere on earth . 
  it 's about working to be better in an imperfect world , and its hard . 
  the us is a country filled with imperfect people , and there 's a ton of room for improvement . 
  but lets not pretend that there have n't been a great number of moral and practical successes in america and across the globe in the last seven decades . 
  if america is really `` the evil empire '' i have to wonder who the good guys are . 
   america does some good . 
  not really more good per capita than anybody else though , although a whole lot more bad . 
  the majority of good that america does is sort of ignored as just being part of the way the world is these days . 
  subtract from the world all of americas foreign commitments and do you really believe the world would keep on chugging along basically unchanged ? 
  i 'm not saying that this is going to happen or ever really could happen . 
  but i think the world would become very problematic , for billions of people , basically overnight , if the united states stepped out . 
  so when i calculate the good that the united states does for the world ( and for itself ) i include in my math all of the nightmarish events that * do n't happen * because of our actions . 
  but people mostly do n't focus on these elements because they are so ingrained into the modern world that we operate in that they 're basically non-factors . 
  have you ever been here , the united states is many things but if you * actually * think it 's just awful you 're delusional . 
  i 'm not entirely clear what we 're supposed to be she super proud of or ashamed of . 
  while it 's fun to look at the world in these black and white terms of america is the worst country and / or the greatest country on earth it 's frankly just childish . 
  what the united states has mostly done for the last 40 years is nothing all that terrible , and * maybe * nothing all that wonderful . 
  in historical terms the last 7 decades have been pretty boring . 
  there have been wars , but mostly fairly small wars . 
  there have been atrocities , but in a historical sense the atrocities have been pretty small . 
  what i see in the modern world is a system where most of the world nations small and large are allowed to participate . 
  nations from brazil to iceland are able to participate on the global stage on largely equal footing . 
  people are more connected than they 've ever been in human history , and international travel is more prevalent than it has ever been . 
  despite the constant negativity the world that we 're living in right provides a better standard of living , for more people , than at any time ever in the history of mankind . 
  and i think you 're being ridiculous if you can not grasp that the credit for the existence of this system belongs in no small part to the united states . 
  the dis-assembly of empiric systems of preferential trade . 
  for a free trade system which gives more or less the entire planet access to the global markets on fairly equitable terms . 
  safe ocean trade preserved by us naval dominance , largely free of charge to smaller nations which lack the resources to protect their own shipping . 
  so what has the united states ( with the support and cooperation of much of the rest of the world ) accomplished in the last 40 years ? 
  an environment of global prosperity , freedom of exchange , and relative peace absolutely unparalleled compared to any time in human history . 
  and while i think its reasonable and good that people focus on issues like nsa spying , illegal use of torture , unjust / ineffective wars , etc. 
  in fact that i think its important that we focus on egregious moral and practical failures , because patting yourself on the back constantly for doing well at many * many * things offers no incentive for improvement . 
  i also am unwilling to describe an era of un-equaled peace and prosperity as a `` non-accomplishment '' . 
   promoting anti-gun violence lately . 
  fight fire with fire !, 
  i would say the * bare minimum * living working wage would be enough to support 1.5 people . 
  so theoretically a family of three with two parents working at the lowest tier of labor would be able to live comfortably ( not just barely scraping by ) . 
  but obviously income would still be largely determined by market forces , buisnesses would just be more restricted in the labor demands they could make of employees . 
  i would also suggest that businesses should be compensated to some degree as having more employees to train / provide benefits for would be a significant extra expense . 
  i was getting really annoyed with you , then i realized you were being sarcastic . 
  i 've always liked sweden , but if they attempt to extradite snoop over this shit . 
  well , i think we 're going to have to invade sweden . 
  ill happily agree that some u.s. sex offender cases are ridiculous miscarriages of justice . 
  still do n't like the european / french model for the right to be forgotten . 
  i 'm not universally opposed to the concept , but it needs to be better defined and less arbitrary . 
  the current method of semi-censorship which is basically only aimed at google ( not other search engines ) is frankly just bizarre . 
  the rules for when / if / why you have the right to be `` forgotten '' are extremely ill defined . 
  i acknowledge that questions of privacy and the like need to seriously considered in the digital age . 
  but the right to be forgotten strikes me as a half baked attempt to solve a problem without actually understanding the problem or the solution very well . 
   equests were just ordinary people that did n't want to conceal some big scandal i read that report it was pretty unclear who was / was n't trying to obfuscate their information . 
  what constitutes a big scandal , if you 've been called out in the news for say being a terrible landlord . 
  is that a crime , a big scandal ? 
  i 'm not sure , but i for one know i would like to be able to find that sort of information . 
  and in a real sense removing it from google 's search algorithms is basically the same as removing it from the internet . 
  i 'm not entirely unsympathetic to the right to be forgotten as a concept . 
  but i do not support the eu model for it which i see as arbitrary and ill defined . 
  i 'm starting to understand where americans got our attitude ... `` hey guys , what if we built 150kw lasers for our ships ?! '', 
  `` i do n't know tom , lasers are really expensive , do you think we really need them ? '', 
  `` no , but they would be totally bad ass '' `` you 're right '', 
   those 1000 people should split those 100 jobs , and still keep the same wage . 
  it 's a logical thing to do . 
  if we do n't do that , then that machine was invented for who ? 
  for shareholders ? 
  is n't that what i said ? 
  i said that the work should be split and that people should be required to do less of it . 
  but when you 're talking about a guaranteed living wage ( regardless of what you do or do n't do ) what you 're really talking about is some people working hard . 
  while other people are permitted to literally do nothing , and that does n't strike me as fair at all . 
  it 's due to this narrative that i 'm often inclined to believe that living wage advocates are mostly just lazy people who do n't want to work .
