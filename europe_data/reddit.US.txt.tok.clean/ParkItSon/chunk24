  it would be one thing if they were advocating for a 30 hour work week or something . 
  but they 're not , they want to do nothing and they feel that they should be paid for it . 
  the problem i have with the living wage / not everyone needs to work people . 
  is that they never seem to specify who does and does n't need to work . 
  the most vehement living wage advocates i 've met in real life basically * already * do n't work . 
  and they definitely feel that ** they ** should n't have to work . 
  of course they 're much less willing to suggest that everyone else should also not work , because after all , they want shit . 
  instead of living wage it seems that a much more sensible option would be to reduce working hours . 
  taxes which would theoretically go to supporting the living wage would instead go to support businesses and workers who can not afford the legislative changes . 
  but i fail to understand why a percentage of the population deserves permanent state funded vacation . 
  while the larger population is required to make an effort to support themselves . 
  no , he meant that google did n't censor it outside of china . 
  inside china they follow china 's laws , but they do n't let china impose external restrictions on them . 
  i know many people who 've done horrible shit that they 'd like to have removed from the internet . 
  right to be forgotten is honestly just censorship no matter how much people like to pretend lthat it is n't . 
  making it difficult or impossible to find information is basically the same as ensuring that the information is never released . 
   `` yes , '' said arthur , `` yes i did . 
  it was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ` beware of the leopard ' . '', 
   it isnt true unfortunately it is . 
   by the way we have reverse our population decline since three years http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/actually-russias-population-isnt-shrinking/ yes you very briefly halted population decline by heavily encouraging immigration and offering cash incentives to have children . 
  that does not impact the long term trends , here 's why . 
  http://populationpyramid.net/russian-federation/ do you notice the major population bulge of people between the ages of 40 and 65 ? 
  this accounts for 16.6 % of the current living male russian * national * population ( not ethnic russians , and as stated above non-ethnic russians actually have a significantly higher birthrate ) . 
  in 20 years the majority of * all * of those people will be dead . 
  i know that because the russian life expectancy for males is about 65 years . 
  but due to disease and extremely high rates of alcoholism a major number of men actually die well before they hit 65 . 
  now compare that population bulge which will shortly be dying off , do you note that it is ** very ** much larger than the current replacement generation ( the generation which is currently not of working age ) in terms of population size ? 
  so in 20 years the when that current demographic group is dead the young workers ( who will in another 20 years ) replace them will be a far smaller percentage of the population than it is now , and on , and on . 
  russia very temporarily has halted population decline by boosting birth rates and working to induce immigrants but the seeds for massive population decline are already sown . 
  the fact that the average age of russians is very high , and their life expectancy is very low . 
   second country that take the most immigrants after the usa and where are these immigrants coming from ? 
  the united states is the ** top ** global immigration destination . 
  i do n't know where russia is but i very much doubt that it 's in the top ten . 
  the primary language of the united states is english , the global lingua franca . 
  the primary language of russia is , well russian . 
  that more or less limits immigration to russian speakers . 
  primarily you 're going to be talking about ukrainians ( problematic ) , uzbeks , tajiks and kyrgiztanis . 
  mostly small countries with small populations with the exception of the uzbeks who have a reasonably prosperous nation of their own . 
  there are n't many places for russia to get immigrants even if they want them . 
  all that one needs to know is birth rate well below replacement rate , limited immigration potential and it is clear that the russian population will shortly be in steep decline . 
   i do n't know man you are too pessimistic . 
  sure there are a lot of problems , but i do n't believe everything is so awful as you portray it . 
  i 'm not pessimistic , demography is one of the few things that can easily be predicted going into the future . 
  for the simple fact that you can not quickly manufacture new people . 
  people must be born and raised , russia is facing demographic collapse even if they were to magically increase their birth rate by some huge amount ( in a time of economic hardship with an ever shrinking number of fertile citizens ) it would still take decades before those people would be productive citizens . 
  with russia 's disastrously poor life expectations , decades of extremely low birth rate , and minimal new immigrant opportunities , a major population contraction , and more importantly a major contraction of working age individuals is inevitable . 
  this is every bit as predictable as knowing that four follows three . 
  it is possible that at some point in the future this downward trend could be corrected but it would take at minimum two decades before you could * begin * to fix the problem . 
   the question is not really correct . 
  russia is multicultural . 
  we are together since 15-th century . 
  we are both . 
  i 'm aware but the united states is also multicultural , but fundamentally everyone here is american first and ( indian / russian / english / pakistani / mexican ... ) second . 
  our cultural identity is fundamentally united there is no possibility of one ethnic group dividing from the united states as a whole . 
  i do n't know how the various russian people 's feel about their ethnicities and their nationality . 
  i personally view russia as a whole to be in an almost unstoppable decline . 
  maybe i 'm wrong but the russian demographics are very * very * grim . 
  and so over the next few decades i expect the russian states ability to do just about everything will severely decline ( from defense to clearing the roads of snow ) . 
  but not all the regions of russia have such a grim outlook as the russian federation as a whole . 
  tatarstan with its location on the volga , it 's cosmopolitan / educated / industrious and open culture makes them a power in their own right . 
  if russia as a whole continues to decline it 's possible that tatarstan may have a brighter future on their own rather than attempting to remain in partnership with a failing power . 
  i 'm not suggesting that tatars hate russia , or anything so dramatic . 
  but russia is in big trouble and the tatars alone can not save the russian federation . 
  in my eyes it is possible that in the not too distant future tatarstan will desire independence . 
  not out of bitterness but because it will be more feasible for tatarstan to deal with its own affairs ( defense , law enforcement , trade , etc ) . 
  with its own not inconsiderable resources , than to contribute to a broadly failing russian state trying to exercise its will over the largest nation on earth as its population ( as a whole ) literally withers away . 
  http://populationpyramid.net/russian-federation/ to me that is not the population pyramid of a healthy nation . 
  but tatarstan has a fertility rate fully ** 70 % ** higher than russia as a whole . 
   just because we are muslim ? 
  no , because you are one of the most educated / productive / demographically strong groups in russia . 
  and while under the current climate being aligned with the russian federation is largely beneficial to the tartars ( see wealth transfers ) . 
  in the relatively near futures ( several decades ) it 's likely that the equation will shift , and the tatars will become net contributors to the russian system as the rest of russia falls behind due to demographic collapse / disease / weakening infrastructure and industrial ability . 
  tatarstan with its strong demographics , excellent geographic position , strong culture , and history of trade and industriousness . 
  is quite frankly likely to be one of the brightest spots in the rf future , the question is do the tatars feel a strong enough connection with russia at large to finance the declining russian state . 
  or will they pull away when the costs of membership come to outweigh the benefits . 
  i do n't know much about tatars culturally , and how they feel about their status as russians , so i really do n't have any clue how they 'll react . 
  but i 'd rather you did n't assume that i just think `` tatars are muslim therefore they blah blah blah , independence '' . 
  i do know a bit about historical tatars and they 're nothing but an impressive people . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roald_sagdeev the question is are they tatars first and russians second , or is it vice versa ? 
  the last time they tried the russians themselves were much stronger . 
  a dirty little secret of the russian federation is that the actual russians are basically dying out , and not reproducing . 
  while other ( hostile ) ethnic groups remain extremely verile . 
  enter into that fact that the chechens have been violently resisting russian occupation for * literally * hundreds of years and you 'd be naive to think this relationship will continue into the russian twilight . 
  ethnic russians are most definitely not the majority in several of russia 's regions . 
  and russia will almost certainly begin to fragment over the next several decades . 
  there just are n't enough actual russians to hold it together anymore . 
  the first to go will be the chechens , after that tatarstan is a possibility . 
  have n't been to italy but i 've travelled through much of europe . 
  everyone is proud of their country / their food / their culture . 
  but i 've only ever been literally lectured by the french about how their way of doing things ( from cooking to paving roads ) is the best way . 
  obviously not * all * french people are like this so i 'm not trying to generalize to everyone . 
  but in all seriousness i semi regularly meet feench people who feel the need to `` educate '' me on how americans do ( x , y and z ) `` wrong '' ? 
  and for the sake of background i rent rooms on airbnb in new york so i spend a fair amount of time with people from just about everywhere . 
  no you do n't understand this is france . 
  thus they are simultaneously the best country on earth and everything they do is the best / correct way to do it . 
  while , ** simultaneously ** they also have it harder then everyone else and they are being put upon by the rest of the world / europe . 
  meh plenty of assholes who would do this shit in america . 
  and i assume plenty of spaniards who would do this shit as well . 
  i 'm less concerned with the nationality and more concerned with the general attitude of buying up the rights to shoot these animals in the first place . 
   one must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been .
