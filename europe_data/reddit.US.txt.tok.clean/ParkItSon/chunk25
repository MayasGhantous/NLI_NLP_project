  - sophocles in other words this will be a good thing if at the end of it all people precieve what has happened as good . 
  if things go balls up people will scream bloody murder about the `` meddling '' `` colonialist '' `` world police '' americans . 
  if things go well we 'll probably get shouted at for not acting sooner , or more probably everyone will forget . 
  in real life nothing is good or bad is tempered by questions of effective vs. ineffective . 
  i hope that this action will allow millions of people to find some degree of safety , and better lives . 
  but there will be people who hate this and violently oppose the decision . 
  good one !, 
  i 'll remember it for parties !, 
  you know why i hate the fucking french , because they think that everything french is the best thing in the world . 
  and it 's not , portugal makes better cheese , germany makes better cars , californians make better wine , and the english came up with a better language . 
  french food is fucking mediocre , this might come as a huge fucking shock but there is a literal ** world ** full of spices and flavors that the french ca n't stomach because it is `` le too hot on meh tongue '' . 
  there are other ways to prepare food other than drowning it in cream and butter . 
  could part of the reason your economy shows few signs of improving is that certain industries are rifer with over regulation and protectionism ? 
  it seems that protectionism is a ** huge ** thing in france . 
  if you compete with my business than instead of improving or shifting into another business people just protest and demand government protection for their particular industry . 
  it 's an over regulated cluster fuck and it 'll just keep getting worse so long as massive inefficiency is subsidized by the government . 
  oh my sides , you 're killing me . 
  queijo fresco , is fuckig amazing , with olive oil salt / pepper . 
  i find it weird that portuguese food / pastries / cheeses are n't more world famous . 
  you guys make amazing stuff but almost no one knows about it ( outside portugal ) . 
  well there is the whole transnistria conflict / dispute still going on . 
  on the plus side they do n't have a border with russia so it 's pretty tricky for russia to `` not invade '' . 
  the n900 was n't released until november 2009 . 
  the iphone model was a 3gs at that point , that means phone / video / camera / gps / and ** yes ** copy paste . 
   even cli access by default ) , with access to all the software available to debian at the time . 
  very little of that matters to an average consumer . 
  to the average consumer an iphone 3gs let you do a lot of stuff , easily . 
  you could browse the web like on a computer , you could navigate by phone , and you could download and play advanced games . 
  part of that was due to 3rd party but that does n't matter that 's what was ( and had been ) available to iphone users * for months * . 
  while the n900 might be your favorite phone ever the average consumer has no idea what it is or what half of you just said means . 
  it 's about the consumer the end user not a well versed computer expert . 
  it was n't released until 2011 ... 
  in the tech world being 6 months behind your competition is a big deal . 
  being 3 years behind your competition is unforgivable . 
  the graph is cute but the actual truth is that ** nokia was n't making smartphones ** . 
  yeah i get it , nokia was * technically * making smartphones but not really . 
  what was awesome about the iphone is that it was a phone that basically worked like a computer . 
  and maemo 5 was * nothing * like that experience at all . 
  nokia did n't release a single product which truly competed with the iphone or android software . 
  it does n't matter who they put in charge , unless you were going to conjure a high end operating system and a dedicated user base out of thin air nokia was already * way * on the back foot . 
  there was no way they were n't going to take a big hit . 
  the smart move would have been to go back to the drawing board and start again . 
  probably with android software and a streamlined product line . 
  but its hard for big companies to change so profoundly so quickly . 
  probably because the eu has literally * never * made a significant foreign policy decision on their own ? 
  i honestly hopes the eu steps up and takes some initative on this but i do n't really expect it . 
  the eu is basically foreign policy ineffective . 
  i bet that 'll work well ... 
  yeah , but the european states are pretty unique . 
  as an american whose experienced america in pretty much every way imaginable . 
  i 've lived in tiny towns , small cities / suburbia , medium sized cities , our very largest cities . 
  lived in the east , in the south and in the north . 
  gone for a swim in both the pacific and atlantic , etc. . . 
  i can safely say that anywhere you go in america , * is america * . 
  there are some variations in local dialect and culture , and some places wont let you fill your own gas tank , but it 's all one country and one culture . 
  but in europe , travel 500 miles and you 're in a different world . 
  everything from the food to the attitude is entirely different . 
  in hungary an idiot american whose clumsy with an manual transmission is liable to get cussed out and punched in the face . 
  in portugal you 'll attract a crowd of grinning old men who will watch you struggle for five minutes before they offer to help you out . 
  any way , i 'm not so worried about us representation in the poll , it is a little odd though to have two countries half represented . 
  if you 're going to include the data it seems like it should be complete . 
  why are people in this poll allowed to have an opinion about russia and the united states but we are n't allowed to have an opinion about you ? 
  seems unfair . 
  in all seriousness though your plugs are ** way ** nicer than the plugs we use in the states . 
  they things plug in so securely , there 's no wiggle , no plugs being bent out of shape always a secure connection . 
  hands down my favorite thing about europe is your appliances and your plugs . 
  some of the very largest companies in existence today did n't even exist two decades ago . 
  there are lots of former giants that are hunting for scraps in the new world . 
  are we now trying to blame every , single , company , failure , on globalization ? 
  seriously , does everyone in europe think that every company just has a right to exist ? 
  if nokia was so good before microsoft they could have chosen not to sell . 
  if they were so good maybe they could of have innovated and invested and built better products . 
  but they did n't , the market changed and they did n't change with it , not nearly fast enough . 
  nokia was making brick phones right into the 2010 's when the writing was already on the wall . 
  i 'm sorry that finns are losing their jobs but this is just how the world works . 
  companies are created , they prosper , they fuck up , they die , rinse and repeat . 
  and just why exactly do indians deserve jobs less than the finns ? 
  because they 're poor , because they 're `` exploited '' ( while working for wages that are very meaningful to them . 
   pardon him , theodotus he is a barbarian , and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature . 
  good one . 
  the solution is wealth redistribution , that 's how you handle the inherent imbalances that arise in a currency union between fundamentally different economies . 
  one size fits all economic policy will always offer advantages to some and dis-advantages to others . 
  when the fiscal policy is united this fact is acknowledged and then corrected for with wealth transfers . 
  but when fiscal policy is n't truly united you get a system where the monetary policy is heavily influenced by the most powerful players . 
  to implement a fiscal policy which most benefits them , while the weaker nations can not truly implement their own fiscal policy to benefit themselves . 
  and they are largely un-able to influence the larger fiscal policy because they are relatively weak and insignificant . 
   alrighty then , what 're you doing to help illegal mexicans in your area ? 
  primarily voting for pro-immigration representatives , but believe it or not mostly legal and illegal immigrants do not need my help and have not asked for it . 
  i 've advocated for and vote for pro immigration policies but there is very little i can do change those policies by myself . 
  and as illegal immigrants are n't asking me for a handout they do n't really need a lot of help from me personally . 
   do you give them your money ? 
  if by give them money you mean use their services and buy products from them yes . 
  but believe it or not mexican immigrants are not out on the streets begging . 
  i do donate to city shelters but in my experience few of the residents there are illegal immigrants . 
   force others to give them money and shelter . 
  have you ever been to the united states ? 
  being a citizen does n't just guarantee you money and shelter . 
  and the vast majority of illegal immigrants are n't asking for it . 
  mexicans work their ass off to provide for themselves , i 've seen it countless times . 
  first generation mexicans are some of the hardest working people on earth and they are n't asking for my charity .
