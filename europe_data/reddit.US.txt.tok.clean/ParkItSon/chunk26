  what they deserve is the right to legal status , access to social institutions , and protection of the law . 
  they are n't looking for a handout , just a better place to live . 
   i think you vote sanders and leave it at that . 
  what if i told you that in a democracy if is n't always up to you to alter the entire national opinion of your country . 
  there are lots of laws in the united states i do n't like much but i ca n't unilaterally change whichever laws annoy me . 
  i 'm well versed in the dutch opinions on outsiders thank you , my girlfriend is 1/2 dutch 1/2 portuguese . 
  she said here favorite question was `` oh where are you from , turkey ? '' . 
  this is / r/europe the vast majority of people here would rather brown people staying out of their country . 
  they 'd just rather not admit that it 's how they feel . 
  wrong , i would actually open a ** much ** more liberal immigration policy in the united states if it were up to me . 
  all of the meaningful economic research on the subject has shown time and time again that immigration is a net positive for an economy . 
  the concept of `` taking our jobs '' or `` lazy immigrants stealing our benefits '' is very little more than a myth . 
  in reality immigrants provide very much and take very little from their adopted nation . 
  do n't assume that i do n't practice what i preach , i would vote * in a heartbeat * for increased immigration access to the united states . 
  i very literally believe it is what my nation has been built upon and i think revisionists decrying the burden of immigration when they are only 3rd or 4th generation immigrants themselves is deplorable . 
  oh poor girl , how silly of you to be born in the wrong country . 
  there there , ** guards ** !, 
   such transfers are only temporary as an american ** hahahahahahaha ** temporary transfers will work so long as all nations are inherently equal but they are not . 
  these nations are inherently different , and there are inherent advantages and disadvantages in each . 
  wealth transfers are not temporary they are the price of unity , a price you will pay forever . 
  in my opinion it 's a price well worth paying but you can never transfer the qualities of germany or france to the other nations of europe . 
  some inequality is baked in and must always be corrected for . 
  so in your eyes if i break into you house , kill your dog and smash up your shit . 
  then set you car on fire and leave a note and video recording of me doing the deed . 
  you do n't think you 'd be able to win a case in civil court for reparations ? 
  that is one form of debt , debt which was forgiven by those trespassed against ** including greece ** . 
  i 'm not claiming that greece did n't fuck up , i 'm saying that for the sake of europe and for the sake of greece their debts should be forgiven and they should receive a second chance as a nation . 
  so because greece does n't have the potential to go on a mad killing spree across a continent they do n't deserve forgiveness ? 
  i fully understand that german strength benefitted the allies and nato . 
  but greece survival will also ( in the long run ) benefit the eu and the ez and germany ( even though it may be a pit pricey in the short term ) . 
  and in the most meaningful sense germany did start ww1 . 
  a serb nationalist alone could n't have , only german backing of the austro hungarian empire made the war possible . 
  maybe getmany should remember that in the end only debt forgiveness allowed them to prosper again . 
  debt forgiveness after they started ** two ** major wars and killed tens of millions of people . 
  sorry but greece deserves debt forgiveness every bit as much as germany did after wwii . 
  i 'm not buying the argument that the lazy greeks do n't deserve it . 
  the germans did n't fucking deserve it , but they still got their third chance and they should remember that . 
  americans view the eu as the united states of europe ( even though it really is n't ) . 
  we find it a little bit appalling that ( within that interpretation ) europe is willing to let its own literally starve and suffocate . 
   russian volunteers stop , my sides , you 're killing me . 
  well none of us here know the extent or the exact purpose of the espionage in question . 
  spying can be both aimed at finding information and finding out about other people 's spying operations . 
  the point is that germany has almost certainly benefited from if not directly participated in corporate espionage against the us . 
  the us has in return participated in corporate espionage presumably stealing secrets and also attempting to root out spy rings being utilized against us . 
  i 'm not going to try to justify spying and i 'm not going to try to defend it . 
  what i will say is that it happens , if the u.s. were an exceptional case rather than the norm i 'd be more concerned . 
  what i do find worrying is wide scale data mining and mass un-targeted communications collecting . 
  that is something that i find deeply concerning and needs to be discouraged both in the united states and around the world ( france , australia , etc. ) . 
  but corporate espionage , spying on world leaders , that sort of thing . 
  really not a concern to me . 
  satire as i understand it ... should be a bit more over the top . 
  this could be re-titled as `` fictional but entirely realistic story about a 37 year old greek man '' ... which is not what i would call satire .

  well a few points on that , first canada 's spending is equivalent to or even slightly more than germany 's . 
  the united states has never expended billions of dollars maintaining canadian sovereignty which is not the case for germany . 
  and as canada is geographically isolated ( like the united states ) this is viewed as largely acceptable . 
  canada has also long won anerican favor because quite frankly they 've always behaved like our closest friends and supported us deeply . 
  it may have been sevens decades ago but americans remember that canada was with us at d-day and the germans were shooting at us . 
  that matters , national memory is a relatively slow moving thing . 
  this contrasts the situation in europe which has frequently required expensive us interventions . 
  here 's the part where people say `` the u.s. was only involved in europe to defend itself '' . 
  yeah , we did n't want russia to conquer europe , that would have been a huge threat to us . 
  that being said do n't pretend like all american decisions are purely evil and pragmatic . 
  we defended european sovereignty and did not unduly impinge on national decision making . 
  defending europe may have been in our interests but it was also very much in the interest of the europeans . 
  americans do n't profit more from our geopolitical profile any more than germany , or many other countries . 
  we certainly benefit from free trade but we also pay for and guarantee it . 
  many , many nations reap all the benefits of global free trade while not being responsible for maintaining the network . 
  the united states would probably be able to acquire a much larger degree of relative wealth by being much more geopolitically conservative , and demanding payment for protection ( the typical behavior of an empiric power ) . 
  but the truth is there 's more to us geopolitics than ** just ** enriching ourselves . 
  you can claim that our own motivation is selfishness if you want but historical reality does n't back up that assessment particularly well . 
   the nato commitments of 2 % and 20 % is basically just an arbitrary number , a static spending target without taking account nato 's real defensive needs . 
  cause that 's what nato is actually for , defense , not power projection in the middle east . 
  except there are and have been actual threats and major problems un-related to me politics . 
  when those threats arise it has been the u.s. ultimately held responsible for intervening in these conflicts while unilateral european actions are dis-jointed and ineffective ( see former yugoslav conflicts ) . 
  now with russia 's recent actions its clear that the age of military threats to nato is very far from over . 
  yet the german response to blatant russian aggression has been extremely tepid . 
  because it seems that ultimately economic ties to russia are more important than ensuring security and sovereignty across europe . 
  canada has taken a harder line against russian aggression than germany has . 
  and finally lets stop pretending that nato commitments and military spending are as simple as confronting a specific threat . 
  the us makes a ** major ** contribution to global trade by ensuring open sea lanes . 
  germany as one of the worlds largest trading nations is hugely dependent on this . 
  so it would be helpful if say germany had volunteered to station their leopards in e. europe as a deterrent instead of the united states . 
   really ? 
  because germany spends twice as much ( % gni ) as the us on development aid . 
  other european countries spend even more . 
  while global development funding is nice lets not pretend that the global economy is based on developmental aid . 
  the global economy is mostly dependent on the health of already developed nations . 
  following the financial crisis germany 's stance was basically that everyone ** but germany ** should be responsible for reviving the global economy . 
  germany relied on american stimulus to revitalized their export markets in n. america . 
  germany relied on the imf to revitalize and stabilize the eu nations . 
  the ecb stimulus plan has in contrast been very small and very slow . 
  it 's honestly shameful that germany even had the gall to suggest a brics bailout of the eu / ez . 
  when unquestionably the largest beneficiary of these unions has been germany . 
  so congrats to germany for its development aid contributions but these contributions are minuscule compared to the debt relief and bailout packages implemented by other nations and institutions . 
  more like the extremely tepid nato commitments . 
  add in an unwillingness to pay for your own bailouts . 
  attempting to orchestrate large u.s. contributions to struggling eu nations through the imf , and trying to arrange similar bail outs by the brics . 
  quite frankly i see germany as a country doing its damn best to benefit from a global system while doing very little to actually maintain that system . 
  in a word , trade deficits .
