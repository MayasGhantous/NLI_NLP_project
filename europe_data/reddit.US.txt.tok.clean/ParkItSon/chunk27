  you 've got to be kidding , germany is the fourth largest economy in the world . 
  you do n't get to play the big country 's bullying small ones card when you 're the fourth largest economy on earth . 
  also when many of germany 's largest industries are franco german partnerships and it 's well known that france is heavily involved in industrial espionage . 
  no , sorry , i 'm not feeling incredibly sympathetic towards `` poor little germany '' . 
   and currently ( and for the foreseeable future , really ) greece costs more money than it produces , and it is absolutely unsustainable in its current form new mexico and xinjiang both cost a hell of a lot more than they produce . 
  the thing that myself and a lot of non-europeans are hoping that you guys figure out is that the value of unity is in the long term , much greater than the costs of propping up currently insolvent states . 
  it 's not an issue of charity , it 's an issue of practicality and stability , the ez and the eu lose credibility if greece exits . 
  and honestly the greeks are perfectly willing to make reforms anyone claiming otherwise at this point is being disingenuous . 
  tsipras ' unwillingness to make cuts ** is not ** what led to this crisis . 
  tsipras ' would n't be in power right now if there were n't already a crisis . 
  europe 's refusal to recognize that there was a severe crisis was ultimately going to come to a head , this was unavoidable . 
   but it 's simply unsustainable to keep extending deadlines for greece while they have no chance of paying the loans back . 
  which is what everyone is saying , which is why the loans need to be restructured . 
  and why there needs to be a fiscal transfer mechanism across the eu to allow smaller economies to compete with the larger nep powers . 
  we 're just not so into the cutting off our nose to spite our face attitude which seems to be prevalent in europe at the moment . 
  not everything has to be a moral statement , sometimes you do something because it 's what makes sense for the wider economy . 
  is puerto rico on the verge of abandoning the us dollar ? 
  is puerto rico 's debt crisis anywhere near as severe as that of greece ? 
  the situation in puerto rico is worrisome , and we may need to have a serious conversation about bailouts at some point in the near future . 
  so far the situation there is certainly serious but there is no imminent risk of a collapse and all the indications are that involved parties are open to negotiations . 
  the unemployment rate is less than 1/2 what greece has , the eu and ez has multiple members with unemployment rates , and debt levels significantly higher than those in puerto rico . 
  in short the situation is much smaller , less severe , and more manageable than the situation in greece and across europe . 
  if things reach crisis levels we 'll handle it , but the situation while grim is hardly dire at this point . 
  it 's funny , yesterday everyone was talking with bravado about how no one cares what greece has to say anymore . 
  things open today , markets take a huge hit , and suddenly it seems that everyone ** does care ** about what the greeks have to say and what the referendum might mean . 
  yesterday everyone was certain that the eu had called greece on their bluff , it seems now it might actually be the other way around . 
  buh buh buh , we have firewalls , the problem will be contained . 
  i swear these people have no idea what a ** crisis of confidence ** means . 
  if greece leaves the ez and the euro it is a huge blow , it does n't matter if the firewalls work or not . 
  what everyone seems to be forgetting is that this will not be the last crisis that the eu or the world will face . 
  economic recessions and crises are a part of life , the ez and the eu are demonstrating that they are incapable of handling these crises . 
   1 ) yes , we definitely have issues with racism , but it is legitimately becoming less each year . 
  it 's not like america does n't have their own problems concerning race . 
  we 're also ** way ** more diverse than every european country . 
  racism is an issue here because people of all races and cultures actually live together and interact all the time . 
  europe is incredibly homogenous austria is basically 90 % german / bavarian . 
  it 's easy not to have any racial / cultural tensions when you do n't actually have other races . 
   literally no idea what this means . 
  most people in europe do n't act one specific way , because were kinds diverse and this is n't some video game where all hundreds of millions of us think exactly alike . 
  it varies from country to country , but in plenty of countries in europe you 'll be treated like absolute shit as the norm . 
  getting directions , service in shops and restaurants . 
  it 's obviously not universal but the amount of outright hostility i 've encountered in europe is leaps and bounds worse than what you 're ever likely to encounter in the states . 
   less than u.s. 
  nationalism , at least in the western countries for sure . 
  american nationalism is largely about taking pride in our diversity and openness . 
  some of the recent top scoring posts on / r/murica were . 
  things like , mocking the confederate flag , telling a muslim how awesome the american flag benches installed at his mosque were , and a huge amount of pride in the full legalization of gay marriage . 
  american nationalism is n't really bitter or directed towards anyone it 's just a general pride , and it 's open to anyone . 
  ask a transylvanian hungarian if they 're from romania and you 'll get a different sort of nationalism . 
   4 ) sure , not every village in austria is fucking disneyland , but this counts for literally every country in the history of countries , especially the united states , which is extremely boring outside of cities . 
  no i mean jesus christ , rules , rules everywhere , some parts of europe are so insanely uptight it 's ridiculous . 
  i got yelled at for crossing train against a red light . 
  in a tiny ass village with one track running through it , and the train was stopped and was still stopped a full minute after i crossed the tracks . 
  it 's not the end of the world or anything but living in a society where everyone is so obsessed with obeying the rules would drive me insane . 
  americans have a healthy disregard for actually following the rules , our principle is more , if you do n't get caught , you did n't break the rules . 
  that 's what i thought about europe before i actually started spending time in europe . 
  i thought europe was like a nicer , more tolerant , more liberal , america with free health care . 
  then i actually spent time there and was blown away by : 1 ) how insanely , openly , racist people are . 
  2 ) the level of over the top rude , outright aggressive behavior i encountered . 
  3 ) the level of nationalistic venom which still exists . 
  4 ) how maddeningly rule based and boring some places were ( looking at you austria ) . 
  i mean it 's a cool continent but i would n't want to live in most of it . 
  except for portugal and maybe italy . 
  do n't you live in a country which bans `` insulting words and behavior '' ? 
  yep , that 's you : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9616750/rowan-atkinson-we-must-be-allowed-to-insult-each-other.html, 
  well i guess most of the eu is an embarrassment then . 
  wow , you seem well informed . 
  and miss the chance to annoy all you salty euro trash , hardly . 
  they still have an air force and i was under the impression your carrier capability was down , but damn you 're right they really have n't kept up . 
  i honestly hope the u.s. intercedes this time . 
  a fair number of people died last time for literally no reason . 
  obama should make a very serious call to kirchner and inform her that we will absolutely skull fuck them if they do n't back down . 
  this military posturing is fucking stupid , the argentinian government is just trying to distract from its shit domestic policy ( just like last time ) . 
  by inventing an outside foe to focus everyone 's attention on . 
  so if we no longer stand for freedom how come we 're still pushing the boundaries of it ? 
  germany does n't have it , slovenia does n't have it , the united states on the other hand does , now . 
  maybe not yesterday , but yesterday is gone , this is today . 
  the united states now has gay marriage , at the same time it has extreme and orthodox religious groups who hate homosexuality , who are perfectly allowed to have those freedoms . 
  but under the constitution of the united states gay men and women have rights equal to all other members of our society . 
  considering our extreme ethnic and cultural diversity it is hard to get people to agree on much in the united states . 
  and yet to this day we continue to lead the way on any number of progressive issues . 
  if the united states does n't stand for and stand up for freedom i 'm not sure which country on earth does . 
  if europe wants to critique the track record of the americans how about you all stop bickering amongst yourself and try to accomplish something in the wider world . 
  but for now it seems like you do n't even have the presence of mind and spirit to keep together a simple currency union . 
  never , so considering that , my opinion of your definition of it does n't mean all that much to me . 
  oh please , the ss hunted the jews and the roma and other undesirables across europe . 
  and more importantly the jews never did ** anything ** to germany . 
  we were at war with japan , japan refused to surrender . 
  that 's the price you pay for going to war . 
  you do n't get to start a war , refuse to surrender , and then claim that you 're the victim of aggression . 
  germany is also the primary beneficiary of the ez . 
  that 's how currency unions work ( i know i live in one ) the beneficiaries pay to maintain equitability with those who have n't benefitted as much . 
  rich states ** give ** the poor states huge amounts of money , every , single , year . 
  that 's what germany should do , and if they do n't want to they should never have created a currency union . 
  japan attacked the united states without provocation and was given a warning before they were bombed . 
  you might call it a mistake i call it total war . 
  vietnam was a war , we supported one side , was it justified i 'm honestly not sure . 
  we also went to war in korea and stayed , s. korea is now extremely prosperous and n. korea is a hellish shit hole . 
  how would vietnam have turned out if we had n't left ? 
  i really do n't know .
