   every country has its flaws yep , that 's what i pointed out . 
  but my initial point remains if germany has an opinion they should take more of a leadership position . 
  as far as i can tell though all germany wants is to be rich and left alone . 
  which is fine , but if you want to critique what other countries stand for maybe you should stand for something more yourselves . 
  that was a poll of german citizens . 
   i feel pretty free here and i feel pretty free here , germany should pay attention to itself , that 's what you guys are really good at any way . 
  it 's almost like these two countries have different histories and different social issues . 
  your country has also never had to invade mine to stop a systematic mechanized genocide in my country . 
  then never spent an ungodly amount your treasure to maintain our sovereignty . 
  i do n't recall a single case of germany standing up for anyone 's freedom but their own . 
  so pardon me if i 'm not particularly concerned with what germans think . 
  why do n't you get back to bankrupting the greeks now . 
  well it seems that they were voting on incomplete data then . 
  i have n't seen many recent polls about what americans think about germany . 
  last time i checked its saturday . 
  yeah and it 's pretty easy to be a critic when your country does n't actually make foreign policy decisions . 
  germans also do n't want to honor their nato commitments , so i feel that germany is n't supporting freedom in e. europe and the baltics . 
  like you said , easy . 
  i 'll take advice from germany when they make a serious effort to advocate for freedom themselves . 
  what has germany done for `` freedom '' lately ? 
  gay marriage is legal in america , not in germany . 
  americans think we do n't give a shit about what germany thinks . 
  there has been no proposal to fix the situation , only to maintain the current disastrous course . 
   we should make a coup or something !, 
  i 'd be careful about that if i were you  . 
  yep , i want the eu and the ez to remain together . 
  it 's not as if the u.s. literally ruling over the whole world is ever going to make sense . 
  what needs to happen is the gradual development of stronger international entities which allow peoples and countries to interact peacefully . 
  the eu is an obvious natural partner to the united states . 
  that being said i do n't see it happening right now . 
  it seems that the desire for national prosperity has trumped the desire for union . 
  union was great so long as everyone was making money off it , but now that sacrifices are required to maintain that union everyone seems unwilling . 
  if you do n't have migrants then the migrants are n't your problem , if you are n't having financial problems than eu fiance is n't your problem , and if you are n't bordering russia eu security is n't your problem . 
  either the problems belong to everyone , along with the success , or the eu can never survive . 
  you 've got to be joking , tsipras and varoufakis , could walk out of greece and find better paying easier jobs ** anywhere ** . 
  you can hate these guys , or call them cowards , or whatever you want . 
  but these are not people looking for cushy government jobs . 
  there are no cushy government jobs to be had in a failing government . 
  these people care about their country , i do n't know how their decisions will ultimately play out . 
  but the one thing i am certain of this that they are not there because they 're greedy and looking for an easy ride . 
  they care about their country and their people , if they did n't care they would n't be there anymore . 
  that 's what i was thinking , it is n't as if they 're just ratifying a budget . 
  this is going to have a huge impact on just about everything it 's way more complex than a fiscal matter . 
  they can say it , and the greek people can throw them out of the government , or not . 
   or simply having each individual state allow it . 
  well that 's the thing , as you said above many popular votes have gone against the issue recently . 
  in certain states and regions which are more conservative the people are probably still majority opposed to gay marriage and will be for some time . 
  but that 's not how our society works , certain rights are guaranteed under the constitution regardless of the popular opinion in certain regions . 
  this decision states basically that the right to equal marriage always existed , and thus all laws ( regardless of their popularity ) which restrict the right to equal marriage are inherently illegal . 
  it is not up to the states or anyone else because ultimately the right has to marry has existed since 1868 . 
  again , bull shit , the right to call a referendum is included in the greek constitution . 
  the greek government is taking action which is allowed to them in the greek constitution . 
  that 's not abdicating responsibility , they 've chosen a path and that path is to request the feelings of the people on the issue . 
   this is a win-win decision for syriza but a very risky one for greece . 
  please , if greece exits and everything goes to hell you can be damn sure syriza wont remain in power for long . 
  any path is a risky path for greece at this point . 
  but ultimately that decision belongs to the people of greece , and syriza was never granted the authority to make that decision for the people of greece . 
  bull shit , they promised the people on something which they tried their damn best to deliver . 
  but ultimately there was no way for greece to pressure the various institutions into a more reasonable deal . 
  now the governments only real option is capitulation which the greek people have clearly voiced their opposition to . 
  or abandonment of the eu and the euro , which the majority of citizens have ** also ** expressed their opposition to . 
  in the circumstances i think it 's quite reasonable that the greek people have the opportunity to make this decision with full awareness of the consequences . 
  this is a very different than the decision to elect syriza , and it should n't be made by a few government administrators who have n't truly been granted that mandate . 
  this is a decision for the greek people . 
  i think british television is pretty great . 
  ha , i 'm just saying i 'm no hypocrite . 
  i think bull fighting / dog fighting / cock fighting is fucking barbaric . 
  you should n't kill and torment animals for entertainment , you 'd think in this day and age that would be fairly obvious . 
  so if you participate in this sort of thing and end up dead as a result pardon me for not seeing the tragedy . 
  edit : word change , pleasure to entertainment , i believe eating meat in limited quantities and with an eye to sustainability is acceptable . 
  doing it for entertainment is just fucked u. 
  i never said there was n't unrest but we are n't on the verge of excommunicating one of our states and allowing the government and basic society to fail . 
  american issues are distinctly internal issues that we deal with internally . 
  not so in europe . 
  i think fdr , churchill , jfk , mlk , we 're all recognized as great leaders during their lifetimes . 
  irregardless it 's true , one of greeks major industries is tourism and cranking up vat to nearly 25 % is going to have a huge impact . 
  people ** will ** go to other countries instead . 
  greeks will collect less taxes , have a worse budget , and be less able to pay back loans or pay pensions . 
  the troika must really just not give a single shy about the greek economy . 
  good , and ( and fyi i am a vegetarian ) . 
  taking entertainment from the intentional torture and killing of animals is fucking barbaric . 
  live by the sword die by the sword , these guys got wha they deserved , or at very least they ca n't complain . 
  i was talking about the romani . 
  aporoximately equivalent if not slightly more than the population in finland .3 %, 
  because i 'm interested , americans mostly get along . 
  sure we 've got plenty of civil / tax / etc. 
  issues to work on . 
  nothing so much fun as new national and currency unions struggling to exist and being torn apart . 
  europe is a giant battlefield , while at the same time you 're all trying to get along . 
  it 's fun to watch and read about . 
  the united states has the largest group of romani immigrants of any country on earth . 
  we 're just better at assimilating people than pretty much every european nation , except for maybe portugual . 
  the only group the u.s. has really struggled to integrate is slave defended african americans . 
  which really is n't that surprising , as there was institutional segregation until only about 50 years ago . 
  we 've got a fair number of somalis ourselves . 
  ahhh europe , a veneer of civility over a deep bubbling core of ethnic hatred and nationalism . 
  airbus estimated that they 'd need to sell about 1200 of the aircraft in order to justify the enormous cost of development . 
  so far they 've got orders about 1/4th of those numbers . 
  the vast majority of the aircraft are operated by emirates , the a380 is a great plane for emirates due to its extreme hub and spoke methodology . 
  but most airliners do n't use this organizational model .
