  also airlines fleet diversification adds costs , the fact that most airlines have n't been willing to make big bets on a380 's kind of suggests that they wont . 
  what this means is that airbus , so far , does n't ** really ** have many customers . 
  there have been basically no new orders for the aircraft for a year now , and no orders from new customers for two years . 
  this would be less worrying if we were in an aircraft buying slump , but we are n't . 
  orders for new aircraft are at record highs right now , this is one of the best environments ever to be an aircraft manufacture . 
  yet airbus ** still ** ca n't find new customers . 
  it 's not just airbus either , boeing also has n't been able to find much of a market for the 747-8i . 
  the whole concept of the 4 engine jumbo jet is being displaced by more efficient two engine jets . 
  this basically means the boeing 777 and the airbus a350 series , the problem is that boeing is pretty clearly dominating this market . 
  for example the newest model from boeing and airbus are the 777x and the a350-1000 . 
  boeing has more than 100 more orders for the 777x so far , even though the first of them wont be completed until 2020 , a full four years after the a350-1000 . 
  even ** more significantly ** the orders for the a350-1000 fell off sharply ( and more than 30 orders were even canceled ) following the announcement of the 777x . 
  that pretty strongly suggests to me at least that the 777x is viewed by most customers as the superior product . 
  they certainly need it with what is looking like an increasingly bad bet on the a380 . 
  this sounds vaguely familiar : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_of_sidra_incident_ ( 1981 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_of_sidra_incident_ ( 1989 ), 
  i encountered the extremes while i was there , got punched in the face for * literally * asking for directions . 
  and had two other dudes try to start fights with me for no reason ( seriously i was n't talking to them , hitting on women they knew , no reason ) . 
  but i also met some of the nicest people . 
  this shop owner at the kelenfold train station did n't speak a lick of english , got me drunk on palinka and beer , refused to let me pay for anything , and we hand signed about rock and rolls and our lives for an hour . 
  also getting punched in the face for asking directions is a really funny fucking story so i 'm not exactly bitter about it . 
  great food , cheap beer , cool cafes , great architecture , crazy pubs , grumpy fucking people ( and some really fucking cool people , but ** mostly ** grumpy fucking people ) . 
   is this how you keep your state united ? 
  freedom is a complex word , americans have always understood this . 
  the only true freedom is the freedom that is taken , not given . 
   the shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep 's throat , for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator , while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty . 
  - abraham lincoln you do n't get any shortcuts buddy , if you want your freedom whatever that means to you . 
  then you better be prepared to take it , no one will give it to you . 
   and how spain does n't even allow us a referendum ? 
  let me look back at the great u.s. british referendum of 1776 , oh look , never happened . 
  as an american have you ever heard of the civil war ? 
  and when those most able to leave ( typically the educated and at least marginally well off ) greece 's tax base is further damaged . 
  leaving an ever more dysfunctional state with even less opportunity to pay debts . 
  not everyone can leave , and the people who remain will need the support that only a functioning state can provide . 
  there is no shortcut to national unity , there needs to be a degree of interstate solidatarity and support which is absolutely not there in contemporary europe . 
  some people say that the european identity is getting stronger , but i have the exact opposite impression . 
  with every new crisis the level of inter state co-operation recedes . 
  many people ( on this sub ) will admit that the eu nations are being left out to dry on many issues . 
  while simultaneously stating their unwillingness for their own nation to take part in shouldering the burden . 
  there is no way to meet those budget targets in the current greek environment and continuing with the troika 's plans will further demonstrate that . 
  greece can set up any budget they want but as the economy shrinks and the governments becomes increasingly impetent the ability to meet those budget goals will also shrink . 
  greece needs medical attention , but the troika 's grand plan is to keep cutting out organs until all of the sick parts are gone . 
  then they 'll stand over a dead greece and wonder why in the fuck that did n't work . 
  there needs to be a political solution , because the existing `` solution '' is n't a solution at all . 
  because the imf 's plans ** by their own admission ** have utterly failed to do anything for the greek economy . 
  when all of the economic `` stimulus '' is actually just being used to repay various loans there is no hope for an actual recovery . 
  europe just wants greece to shut up and sit in quiet decrepitude , and the greek people have had it . 
  either the imf and ecb will accept that there needs to be a new plan , or the greeks will leave rather than continue their slide into deeper and deeper decrepitude . 
  i hope you 're right , we 'll find out tomorrow i guess . 
  meh , better to be dirty than to start a nuclear war by being direct . 
   lol . 
  could there be anything more american then failing in geography ... 
  sometimes stereotypes are so accurate it 's scary ... alright that 's what started this off , i 'm willing to say i 'm sorry if i took it too far . 
  and for the record i 'm perfectly aware of and even fond of the baltic states . 
  i just think you jumped to the whole `` americans are ignorant hurr hurr '' line a bit quick , and so yes i got defensive . 
  alright , and yet not a single current article that i 've seen is suggest that yukos has in any way agreed to the current proceedings . 
  everything suggests that this is an action by the belgian government without any consultation with yukos . 
  if you 're going to read through my sources why do n't you just post your source for . 
   also , the yukos plaintiffs agreed to this . 
  because i can not find it . 
  i 've read several articles , not one mentions what you 're saying . 
  here 's the international business times quote from the yukos representatives . 
   `` russia has made no effort to contact us to try and discuss ( the $ 50 billion award ) and has made it very clear that they are not going to pay it , so we are left with no choice but to enforce it , '' tim osborne , director of the gml group of shareholders told reuters . 
  that 's from six hours ago , so if you 've got a fucking source post the fucking source . 
   also , the yukos plaintiffs agreed to this . 
  source ? 
  i was on a phone , it does n't show the little notation , they 're similar allright . 
  we 're already fighting about it in the comments below . 
  if you want to read a petty , pointless , caffeine fueled , sunday morning bickering then i recommend you check it out . 
   now you 've only given him more reasons for calling americans jerks . 
  i prefer direct , abrasive , open , honest , and loud but jerk can work in a pinch . 
  i 'm not the one pointlessly elevating the importance of flags , that 's your choice . 
  unless you 're ** as aware ** of that same information as it relates to other municipalities which are by any objective measure just as if not more significant than latvia . 
  then you should n't play the `` durrr durrr americans are ignorant because they confused two flags which are both red with a white stripe '' . 
  i 'm not picking on him because he 's self important , he wanted to play the `` ignorant american '' because i confused the latvian and austrian flag ( they 're pretty fucking similar ) . 
  i 'm not demanding that he have a frankly unimportant knowledge of us state names or flags . 
  but if he wants to elevate the knowledge of flags to the most salient indicator of intelligence . 
  than i do n't think its unreasonable to illustrate an almost certain lack of awareness in pieces of information which are objectively speaking every bit as significant . 
  seizure by the russian government of assets owned by * yes * shadey russian oligarchs along with a not insignificant number of foreign investors . 
  courts have ruled these asset seizures illegal and have ruled against russia for monetary damages to be awarded to the plaintiffs . 
  russia has ignored all rulings and refused reparations despite court rulings , in violation of international law . 
  plaintiffs have petitioned courts of several nations including belgium to seize russian national assets in order to repay the reparations already levied against russia by the courts . 
  belgium courts found this argument to be legally convincing and did so seize the assets . 
  this forfeiture was deemed to be in violation of international treaties so now the government has modified the law so that the courts can no longer implement asset seizures which violate international treaties . 
  how 'd i do ? 
  while the asset seizure may be in violation of some international treaties it is aimed at correcting a prior violation of international law and treaty as recognized by the belgium courts . 
  sometimes the law is n't enough , laws can be contradictory and invalidate each other like in this case . 
  sometimes you just need to sack up and do what needs to be done , and work out the proper legal justification later . 
  but if your primary goal is avoiding any international conflict at all costs belgium made the right call here . 
  right , they got to avoid a conflict , no balls . 
  if you do n't know all the us state flags i can say the same about you right ? 
  those lazy feckless greeks , coating themselves in olive oil and penguin sliding around the streets of brussels when they should be solving the crisis . 
  meh , laws and treaties are more guidelines than actually hard rules . 
  a country with balls would stick its dick in russia 's eye . 
  after all if we 're talking about international laws and treaties they 're already invading their neighbors in violation of laws and treaties . 
  so fuck them , if the belgians grew a pair they 'd be using this as an excuse to slap the russians in the face . 
  instead they backed down , and that 's the truth of it . 
  dude here 's the hard truth the economy of latvia is about 1/50th of the economy of ** just my city ** . 
  and the entire population of your nation is about 1/10th the size , again just of my city . 
  most americans do n't know shit about latvia for the same reason that most americans do n't know how to shoe a horse . 
  because for 99.9 % of americans it does n't fucking matter and there is no practical reason to care .
