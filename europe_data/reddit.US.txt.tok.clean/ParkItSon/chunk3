  so diesels are just mostly not sold in the united states . 
  since gasoline is cheaper here than in europe the relative inefficiency was less of a problem . 
  it 's not clear , but they 've admitted that this impacts 11 million vehicles most of which were not sold in the united states . 
  the tdi was emitting something like 40x 's acceptable levels , i know u.s. california standards are high , but i have a hard time imagining they 're 40x 's higher than comparable standards in other countries . 
  but i really do n't know , and i 'm not going to do the research at the moment . 
  if i decide to buy some vw i 'll do the research and let you know . 
  but i think the stock wo n't find its bottom for a few weeks still so i 'm not in a hurry . 
  they did n't just advertise the mileage though . 
  if i go and test drive a car and it performs in a certain way the consumer has a right to that performance being real . 
  the cars will now perform considerably worse , and they 'll be using more gas , even if that fuel consumption is as advertised , they no longer perform as advertised . 
  i 'm also not convinced that they are n't at least partially responsible for the false and unofficial reputation the vehicles have earned . 
  if it is common knowledge that in the real world the vehicle performs better than epa testing would suggest that contributes to vehicle sales . 
  and it 's probable that dealerships were essentially advertising the better gas mileage to consumers . 
  even if they did n't have an actual legal right to expect that mileage it impacted their decision making . 
  and if vw authorized re-salers were making such claims ( they probably were ) that probably still qualifies as false advertising . 
   there is no operational change to the car . 
  just because it 's software does n't mean no operational changes . 
  it 's 2015 computers are reading data from the vehicle and altering engine / transmission / traction systems all the time . 
  this has played a huge role in the increasing power and efficiency of engines of the last decades . 
  engines are no longer dumb mechanical systems but highly adaptive computer controlled systems making thousands of adjustments every second to optimize the vehicle for current conditions . 
  it seems likely to me that they 're the only ones doing this in the united states at least . 
  there just is n't much a market for compact diesels here . 
  the only consumer vehicles that really use diesel are the larger varieties of trucks . 
  and i think it 's in large part the size / weight of those vehicles that makes it practical to build engines which run clean enough to meet emissions standards . 
  there are very few commuter type diesel cars being marketed in the united states . 
  volkswagen was solidly dominating that market . 
  chevy has been offering a car with a very similar engine to the jetta 's which have been relatively popular here . 
  but the cars have n't sold well and they 've gotten pretty bland reviews . 
  very possibly because they were n't doing the sort of manipulations that vw was , the cruz was noted to be :  but it 's also been dinged for slow response and uneven power in stop-and-go city and suburban driving . 
  i 've also kind of think that others were n't doing this because it 's ** so fucking stupid ** . 
  how did they think that at no point was some inspector going to think `` hey something seems wrong here , these numbers do n't all match up '' . 
  and go digging deeper for the answer . 
  that 's what 's so surprising about this case , you 've got to look at it and think really , they did that ? 
  i 'm not trying to excuse other manufacturers for their failures to comply to safety regulations and initiate proper and timely recalls . 
  but there 's quite a difference between not initiating a recall once you know something is wrong . 
  and going into a market , knowing your vehicle does n't meet regulatory standards and saying `` fuck it we 're going to cheat '' . 
  that 's a pretty crazy way to behave , even for an `` evil multi national '' , and it 's not like they 're bribing officials in zambia or something . 
  i 'm not saying that nestle exploiting young african mothers is any more morally acceptable . 
  but i can understand how they thought they 'd get away with it , it 's africa you can basically bribe your way out of problems . 
  but to so blatantly sneak around the epa in the united states , seriously , what did you think was going to happen , you did n't think anyone would figure this out ? 
  this is just so , so dumb , it is n't as if they were even selling that many of these vehicles ( here at least ) . 
  they sold a few hundred thousand of these cars over several years . 
  which is n't nothing , but it also was n't a crucial element of their global strategy , or even their us strategy . 
  this is going to end up costing them more than they could have hoped to earn in this particular market ( compact diesels in the united states ) ** in decades ** . 
  even the old `` well breaking the rules is worth more than the fines we 'll receive '' does n't hold up here . 
  the level of risk / reward calculations here were totally out of wack . 
  i 'm honestly just baffled by the level of stupidity and arrogance that made this possible . 
  i did n't say they `` accidentally '' cut corners , i acknowledged that they were violating regulations . 
  but at the end of the day they did n't intend to cause a blow out . 
  our current system may very well be too lenient on this stuff , i think the problem comes from the top . 
  if playing fast and loose with safety regulations saves money it 's usually a good bet . 
  so from the top down there is pressure for people to cut corners and save their departments money . 
  but so long as the people who are creating these negative pressures are ultimately not materially harmed for their behavior why change ? 
  sure this stuff hurts bp but even if executives are fired they walk away with millions of dollars , and with their networks of friends they can find new high paying work pretty easily . 
  if individuals face a far higher risk of actual life changing punishments being levied against them personally . 
  i think we 'll start to see real changes in the ethics of business . 
  but so longs as the entity which is primarily damaged by this sort of thing is the * the company * this issue will persist . 
  it 's just another way to privatize gains while socializing losses . 
  executives score big bonuses and salary hikes by encouraging corner cutting down the line of command under the guise of `` cutting waste / improving efficiency '' . 
  shit hits the fan when a disaster or occurs of a literal fraud comes to light . 
  the executives get the axe so that the company can show to investors and consumers that they take this seriously . 
  but the executives have money , often a lot of money , and they can afford to be laid off . 
  but when the damage to the company forces them to cut their workforce thousands of normal people who did n't have any idea what was going on , or benefit materially from the corner cutting . 
  these people lose their jobs because the the company pays out billions in fines and settlements . 
  normal people who lose their job do not have millions of dollars in savings , or necessarily own their home , they need to be employed and losing a job hurts them much more than it hurts an executive . 
  and of course the executives have their network , so long as they are n't the poster child for the fraud and corruption they can lay low for a few years . 
  then call up some friends and get another high paying position at another company . 
  the incentives are all wrong , we 've got this idea that executives are interested in doing what 's best for the company . 
  when the reality is that they are * mostly * worried about doing what 's best for themselves . 
  we need to change the laws so that `` the company '' can not be used as a convenient scapegoat for the higher ups . 
  while the average workers suffer the real costs of these predictable fuck ups . 
  i know but what some people here are suggesting is that other manufactures must have known about this . 
  because they were presumably taring down vw 's to try to understand their clean engine innovations . 
  i was pointing out that there are n't really any other companies in the u.s. even trying to sell small diesel cars because it 's hard to make diesel clean enough and they just are n't that popular here . 
  so it does n't surprise me that other car manufactures would have had no idea that this was going on . 
  it 's just not something they would care much about . 
  i think by the time this is all over they 'll end up paying out at least two or three ** years ** of profits . 
  fines - in the u.s. alone , and just in regard to the epa you 're looking at potential fines of 18 billion . 
  and i 'm not at all certain that the epa is going to be the only government agency involved here . 
  because they ** knew ** what they were doing it 's pretty apparent that they 've committed all sorts of fraud . 
  legal fees - oh god the legal fees , they are going to be paying so many lawyers for so many different cases . 
  settlements - they 're going to get sued big time , class action lawsuits looking for a big percentage of the vehicles original values . 
  and they 're in a shitty position to defend themselves because they ** knew ** that they were defrauding the customers . 
  voluntary reparations - they willfully defrauded their customers , to win back any sort of positive opinion they 're going to have to make nice in a meaningful way . 
  lost sales / wasted capital - lots of idling production lines , lots of cars no longer eligible for sale , lots of workers to pay who may not have anything productive to do some time . 
  and finally on top of all of that the lost reputation of the company is likely not a good thing either . 
  on top of all of that time is not on volkswagen 's side , the various government agencies and private lawyers do n't have anything to lose dragging out the case . 
  but volkswagen does , the more this is in the news the worse it 'll be for them long term . 
  negotiating from a position of weakness , having already admitted wrongdoing , and wanting this to all go way quickly . 
  they 're going to be accepting some very painful concessions to get this all over with . 
  jesus what an astronomical fuck up , i can not believe they thought this would n't be spotted eventually . 
  the arrogance is almost unbelievable . 
  yeah , but after reading the article it looks like most of those vehicles were sold globally . 
  only vehicles sold locally would subject to epa fines , though i would assume they might be subject to fines from regulatory agencies in other countries . 
  that would raise the potential fines into the 30 ** billion ** range . 
  volkswagen is about to set a record for largest corporate fines and legal settlements ever . 
  it would , but they probably did n't know . 
  i do n't think car companies spend a lot of time taking apart their competitors vehicles searching for defects / violations . 
  not necessarily , diesels just are n't that popular in the us first place . 
  most companies here just do n't make small diesel cars .
