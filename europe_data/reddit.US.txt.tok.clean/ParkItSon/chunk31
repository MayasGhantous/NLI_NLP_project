  when time is in your favor there is no reason to hasten a conflict and maybe with time a confrontation may no longer be necessary . 
  we 'd rather you not . 
  haha , hahahahaha , well good luck telling the poles and the baltic states that russia is their friend and the u.s. is the real enemy . 
  being edgy might be adorably counter cultural in denmark , but for the people actually living in it russian dominion was less than a joking matter . 
  fucking fifth columnists . 
  then do n't give them anymore money and kick them out of the ez and eu just stop pretending like the troika reforms are worth anything . 
  the austerity and suggested reforms have n't worked and they wo n't work . 
  if you do n't believe that greece will change then fine , do n't throw good money after bad . 
  but stop pretending like you know best and if the greeks just follow your lead things will get better . 
  in other words shit or get off the pot . 
  imagine if you had shitty credit , because say you lost your job defaulted on a bunch of loans . 
  then you get a great new job that 'll pay quite well and put you back in a good position . 
  one problem , no car and you live in a town with no public transit ( we 'll pretend this is in america ) . 
  so you ca n't get to your job unless you can find a way to get there . 
  in this scenario a loan ( even a shitty loan ) could save your career . 
  just because you have to pay the money back does n't make it useless . 
  greece needs to implement structural changes , the greek government understands this . 
  but right now they have no resources to enact meaningful change . 
  the european solution is spend less save more , but since greece already does n't have a * job * it 's basically impossible for them to save and thus implement the changes . 
  but the eu is more concerned with moralizing about '' * lazy scheming greeks * '' than actually solving the problem . 
  it 's not about childishness it 's a about market access . 
  there is a real possibility that if greece leaves the ez and eu it will implement at least * some * trade protectionist measures . 
  one of the big reasons that people have historically fought wars is for access to markets . 
  if greece exits the euro and eu , they 're successful and they impose some trade restrictions . 
  then exiting the euro might start to seem like a good option for other currently depressed economies suffering under austerity in the zone . 
  if that happens and free trade is even partially restricted in those regions it would be a huge problem for germany . 
  so germany would n't be acting childishly , they 'd be trying to head off a potential threat to their export driven economy . 
   anyone has the time to plot growth for the uk in the 1990 's vs. the 2000 's ? 
  last time i checked the uk did n't adopt the euro . 
  back to the good old days , when europe was impossible to talk to and '' * you and i * '' are at each other 's throats or something . 
  i 'll bring the bourbon you bring the vodka and we can both tell stories about that time we invaded paris . 
  interesting article , i 'd like to know what sort of punitive measures germany ( or europe as a whole ) might take to * punish * greece for defaulting , and returning to their own currency . 
  germany is so export dependent , if their markets come under threat that 's a very real concern for them . 
  greece is small potatoes but if this does n't end with greece what 's at stake is much larger . 
  well the eu is much more significant than a club of countries with shared values . 
  the uk is a very important eu member and they do n't use the euro . 
  the eu itself is sort of a tertiary government over the eu members with limited but still meaningful powers . 
  wealth re-distribution and aid is actually a part of the eu 's current function . 
  if greece leaves the ez it 'll be tricky for them to remain in the eu . 
  as i understand it leaving the ez will mean the violation of a number of eu treaties . 
  not to have the americans all chiming in at once but this is a question that goes far beyond financial institutions . 
  these are questions of confidence , about what the euro and the eu even mean . 
  if a state , even a tiny state like greece leaves it throws the entire institution into doubt . 
  the u.s. dollar has survived and thrived on faith . 
  faith in our economy , in our national stability , in the understanding that we actually will do whatever it takes . 
  if the eu fails to resolve this then faith in the very concept of the eu will be severely damaged . 
  this is the first crisis the eu and ez have faced , it will not be the last . 
  if the eu can not handle economic recessions without expelling members than no one is going to take this organization seriously . 
  because you can be certain that there will be many more crisis in the coming decades and europe is demonstrating its inability to weather these inevitable events . 
  the current situation will persist until the various electorates reach a breaking point and lash out against the status quo . 
  the fact that the greeks already elected syrizia means they 're * close * to that point . 
  the question is are they now willing to follow through on their threat of a compromise is n't reached . 
  i suspect that if syrizia ca n't secure any concessions from the ecb they 'll request a referendum . 
  if the referendum shows a willingness to accept further austerity under the current plan things will chug along until things get so bad that people just want out ( no matter the costs ) . 
  eventually this will happen , there is a limit to how long people will accept a non-functional system without demanding a change . 
  it does n't mean the change will actually be better but that is unimportant . 
  eventually people will just get to fed up to continue . 
  are they there yet ? 
  not sure , they 're close but maybe not at that level of desperation yet . 
  in a case like this there is only one way to know , wait . 
  economic crises are just a part of capitalism , there will always be booms and busts ( though the severity of these vary greatly and can be regulated in many ways ) . 
  the problem with the euro system is that you 've tied many economies together in such a way that they are not truly unified and not truly independent . 
  you can not share prosperity without sharing in hardship . 
  this is just a fact of life . 
  now the countries that have benefitted most from union ( see the big exporters who have taken advantage of open markets ) . 
  are trying to keep all of the gains , without the inevitable losses and returns ( give backs ) . 
  you need wealth transfers , but nobody whose doing well wants to transfer wealth to those who are n't . 
  and within the current system there is no actual obligation for them to do so . 
  your english is very good but the word you 're looking for is : major - as in significant , or noteworthy . 
  vs. mayor - the political executive of a town or city . 
  for example : bill deblasio is the ** mayor ** of the ** major ** american city new york . 
  yeah , but the most important tactic is still just putting ourselves in the way and daring the other side to do something about it . 
  has worked quite well for decades . 
  ireland the headquarter of apple and every other major trans national economy . 
  greece and ireland are different places with different economies . 
  one sized fits all economic plans are generally not great ideas . 
  i 'll agree that greece made some mistakes and was unwilling to reform in certain ways . 
  but the current greek government is actually serious about implementing positive reforms . 
  just not the reforms that the eu wants ( ie * cut pensions raise taxes ) . 
  because these reforms will just hasten the economic death spiral . 
  there is political will in greece to change now but they can not save the economy by wishing it so . 
  they need resources to implement an effective government , resources that they do not have right now . 
  raising taxes will do no good if you ca n't hire tax collectors . 
  you 're right that no one state would be allowed to dictate terms . 
  this is basically equivalent to the municipal bond crisis . 
  but even though these crisis did n't impact everyone directly it is recognized that the secondary effects will impact the entire nation if a solution is n't found . 
  so there are wealth transfers , the terms of these transfers are n't dictated but they always occur . 
  greece really is n't trying to dictate terms ( despite how they 're being portrayed ) there asking for some sort of relief . 
  the germans really do n't want to make true wealth transfers a habit . 
  that 's why the imf is involved in the first place , the eurozone is rich enough to handle this financial crisis . 
  but they do n't want to set a precedent for intra european wealth transfers . 
  by going to the imf they are offloading the responsibility of a bailout to an international organization . 
  you 'll note that the imf was never involved in the american bail outs . 
  and do n't forget about the american stimulus plan which was worth well more than 1/2 trillion dollars . 
  that was all funded by u.s. tax payers , not an international fund . 
  no one is suggesting that greece should be able to dictate terms . 
  but greece was never really bailed out in the first place . 
  the banks were bailed out by the imf , so in a sense the countries which made loans to those banks ( like germany ) had their money returned to them ( in large part ) by the imf . 
  now greece must repay this bail out to the imf , but they ca n't handle payments that size . 
  the european `` stimulus plan '' has n't even been fully funded so greeks are basically just using stimulus money to repay imf debts ( which does n't help their economy ) .
