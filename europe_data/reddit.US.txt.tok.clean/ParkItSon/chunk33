  somehow i doubt it ... 
  yes , the union of the european nations was a stated goal of the united states and was strongly supported by the united states . 
  the ecsc was an american influenced idea and the united states was the first non-member to recognize them . 
  nato is often seen as the de-facto `` european military '' since there is n't an actual unified military . 
  the united states contributes ** more than ** 2/3rd 's of all nato resources . 
  despite the fact that we are a * smaller economy ** and a ** much smaller ** population . 
  europe never even got close to unifying itself , it 's only since the rise of and the intervention of the united states that europe was able to unify to the extent it has today . 
  well maybe you 're right , no one knows for sure . 
  i 'm basing my judgement on historical truths , but no one can truly predict the future . 
  i think you 're guilty of wishful thinking , europe is n't peaceful ** today ** and that is with the existence of nato and the de-facto protection of the united states . 
  hell it 's questionable ** today ** if the eurozone will even survive . 
  but maybe you 're right , maybe some hardship would convince everyone to pull together . 
  personally i think that the united states and nato are victims of their own success . 
  we 've kept a peace so long and so absolute that no one even believes that wars can happen anymore . 
  they 've come to believe that a state of peace is the norm rather than an exception from human history . 
  i 'll say that i hope you 're right and that i 'm wrong , but i do n't think that i am . 
  do i think you would all go to war overnight ? 
  no , of course not . 
  what i think is that little wars would start in places that many europeans think of as `` not europe '' . 
  i think there would be ** little ** disputes . 
  some countries would be close and have good relationships and while others would have disputes and get along poorly . 
  some countries would intervene in ** little ** conflicts and others would protest the intervention . 
  its nothing so simple as the u.s. leaves and europe goes to war with itself . 
  rather the sense of unification would start to erode , little wars would break out and erode things further . 
  it is n't as if everyone woke up one day in 1914 and said `` hey lets fuck up our continent beyond recognition '' . 
  instead many small conflicts and disagreements built up into a tension which eventually triggered a major conflict . 
   you should tell that to the 192.5 b spend on the 1.5 m of active personnel . 
  which is less than 1/3rd of what the united states spends even though you 've got a larger population and a larger economy . 
  no i do n't think the europeans pull their own weight . 
  well i 'm not saying they 're wrong but i 'm wondering how they draw those conclusions exactly . 
  over 2000 nuclear weapons have been detonated so obviously the weapons themselves are n't going to cause these effects . 
  so nuclear winter then must be attributed to secondary events . 
  but events similar to what would be attributed to a nuclear exchange have occurred before . 
  large volcanic eruptions , annual forest fires , and the fire storms of ww2 ( including the hiroshima storm ) . 
  so to me it seems unlikely that a single small exchange would actually precipitate a nuclear winter . 
  that being said , i 'd rather not risk it . 
   probably cause some sort of climate change uhhhh , no , the u.s. alone has detonated more than 1000 nuclear weapons in tests and it had little to no impact on the climate . 
  one reason ( amongst others ) that a peaceful world order and control of proliferation is so important is that nuclear war is something which is a real concern . 
  local nuclear wars ** really could ** happen and the world would n't end . 
  doomsday would almost be easier to deal with , push the button the world ends no problem . 
  but stopping or containing little nuclear wars would be an absolute nightmare . 
  if you want peace , prepare for war . 
  the reason that europe has been * largely * peaceful for the last sevens decades is not because you are all so enlightened and democratic that you 've `` gotten over war '' . 
  the reason is because one actor nato ( ie * the united states ) has been able to exercise a monopoly on what is often referred to as legitimate force . 
  nobody fights wars because it is well understood that there is a greater power which will not tolerate that sort of thing . 
  in much the same way that members of a society do not * generally * rape , murder , and steal . 
  because it is understood that there is a greater force which will not tolerate this behavior . 
  so ultimately any gains expected from violating the law are outweighed by probable loses . 
  the suggestion that europe would be more peaceful and better off without the united states is frankly laughable . 
  and is n't backed up by ** any ** logical or historical precedents . 
  it 's just wishful na\u00efvet\u00e9 . 
  the point is that europe has only been able to maintain peace when `` backwards ass '' americans have aggressively intervened in your ability to enact foreign policy goals . 
  in fact i 'd go so far as to say most european nations have been largely excluded from significant foreign policy decisions . 
  only since the u.s. excluded europe from foreign policy and relegated you folks to domestic concerns . 
  ** only then ** was europe able to maintain peace . 
  and that intervention persists to this day , the european peace is maintained and enforced primarily by u.s. institutions which europeans benefit from while pretending like they are un-important or `` backwards '' . 
  awww the self hatred is cute , if not particularly well founded in facts or reality . 
   i live in a social democratic country in europe , without the ass backward thinking of both extremes . 
  ahh right the long and peaceful history of europe before the united states . 
   you are fighting phantoms , there are no territorial ambitions of hungary on transylvania or anywhere for that matter . 
  this level of willful ignorance is frankly astounding . 
  there is literally a territorial land war being fought on the borders of the european union . 
  to suggest that the age of territorial ambitions in europe is past greatly inclines me to classify you as a large , flightless , african bird . 
  greece and turkey have also been at cross purposes with regards to territorial claims for quite some time now . 
  and lets not even get started on the balkans and the caucuses . 
   hungary on transylvania just because there are no credible claims being made today does n't mean these things are beyond possibility . 
  the time to judge an organizations lasting stability is not during a period of prosperity but during a period of crisis . 
  so far the eu has experienced ** just one ** financial recession and its already shaken the stability of the eu to its very core . 
  http://www.nineoclock.ro/leader-of-hungary%e2%80%99s-extremist-party-jobbik-makes-bellicose-statements/ when hungarians are electing hyper right wing , nazi-esque parties in not insignificant numbers i 'm not willing to take any possibilities off the table . 
   as for bluster , you sure seem full of it in this comment . 
  bluster implies an unwillingness to act , when hungarians espouse nationalistic territorial ambitions against their nato allies that 's bluster . 
  when i say `` if hungary dipped a toe into transylvania it would illicit a blistering american response '' , that 's not bluster that 's fact . 
  the u.s. has spent the last seven decades making it abundantly clear to all its nato partners that they are not to act up without the bequest of the u.s. 
  some good reading : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis  the us is a bully on a geopolitical level . 
  maybe , so long as we 're the bully keeping you folks from slitting each others throats i 'm ok with it . 
  i would be happy to see the eu on taking a more assertive role on the global stage . 
  but what i actually see is a lot of internal bickering which is thankfully these days ( thanks to the u.s. ) consigned to the economic rather than the military sphere . 
  it 's sad that seven decades after the world wars ended i do n't honestly believe that european cohesion and alliances would hold without the active participation of the united states . 
  and few nations demonstrate this better than hungary . 
  all it took was a recession to spark a rise of hyper nationalistic right wing loonies making noises about recapturing territories from their nato allies . 
  and the only reason i know that these rumblings are just meaningless bluster is because the united states will slap the mother loving shit out of hungary if they so much as dip a toe into transylvania . 
  but if we were n't around , i 'm not so sure that 'd be the case . 
  well lets do it in u.s. then . 
  my favorite moment from the referendum : http://www.theonion.com/article/david-cameron-to-scottish-people-ill-kill-myself-i-36941, 
  yeah , but those would be their military and not under our direct control . 
  in the near term it 's bed we have the guns than them , in the far future we might start talking about global taxes but we are n't quite there yet . 
  this is a sort of first step , these things take time and it 's better done slowly than trying to rush it and force people into a world they are n't prepared for . 
  this way the u.s. role grows slowly and engenders less ill will . 
  on the one hand the europeans attitude is a bit annoying . 
  on the other hand it just demonstrates the real global significance of the united states . 
  we are quite literally the world 's police , and in a real sense we do rule the world . 
  on the one hand that sucks , because we get stuck with the bill . 
  on the other hand our dominance has maintained a global peace unlike anything ever seen in history . 
  the europeans are n't a global power any more . 
  their concerns are primarily local / domestic concerns . 
  the united states has global concerns the europeans are quite frankly a subsidiary power to the u.s. and they luckily do a pretty damn good job with their own domestic policies and do n't trouble us much which is nice . 
  but we ca n't really expect them to exert themselves to influence global events when it is well understood that on the global stage they dont get to act without our consent . 
  when it comes to global intervention the europeans now bend to u.s. wishes ( though it 'd probably kill some of them to admit it ) . 
  russia is throwing up one last challenge to u.s. pre-eminence but the russians are an already defeated `` foe '' . 
  they 're still kicking a bit but time is not on their side .
