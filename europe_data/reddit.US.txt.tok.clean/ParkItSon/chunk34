  the russian people / industrial plant / technological abilities are all falling further and further behind . 
  with every passing day russia falls more and more into irrelevance . 
  all we need to do is maintain the current levels of pressure and eventually they too will be folded into the american world order . 
  after that our last global hurdle is china , and they do n't worry me much . 
  weak demographics , internal concerns , iffy technological base , china is certainly a rising power but they are n't rising very fast ( in a global power projection way ) . 
  so in a sense we 've won , we 've exported our culture to every corner of the globe . 
  our military reigns supreme with a few minor remaining challenges that can be allowed to fizzle out with pressure and time . . we 've managed to ( quite peacefully ) conquer the world , now unfortunately as the world 's rulers we 've gotten stuck actually governing it . 
  unfortunately people are mostly not going to be grateful and everyone is going to be a critic . 
  and we 're going to fuck up plenty and deserve plenty of criticism . 
  such is the price of the pax , but i 'm willing to pay it and so are most americans i think . 
  til : bavarians are fucking retarded . 
  is fucking cows ok ? 
  i assume that fucking cows is ok . 
   france has to remain great and the shining beacon of hope in the world . 
  oh wow , is that what you think people think of you ? 
  because nobody thinks that about you , literally no one . 
  til : the french are fucked up parents ... 
  so the reason that the european nations have n't stepped up to confront fifa 's corruption is because they were actively involved in it . 
  makes sense . 
  the u.s. has n't even come close to losing at the actual fighting . 
  the problem is the concept of winning implies that there is someone to defeat . 
  in the middle east there is n't anyone to win against because the fundamental issue is power vacuums and ethno / religious conflicts which have been going on for centuries . 
  that 's not ukraine , ukraine is a semi functional and coherent country which is being invaded by an external force . 
  all we need to do is kill off the invaders and we win , we 're not trying to invent a functional nation where this is n't one like in the me . 
   the western world the western world particularly the united states has the majority of ** all ** the military capability in the world . 
  hell one u.s. carrier has more capability than the air forces of almost all of the european countries . 
  so if russia wants to fight the west they 're for all intents and purposes fighting everyone . 
  can we all just quit the bull shitting and hand wringing . 
  what 's going on in ukraine is going to come down to a fight . 
  either we 're in it with ukraine or we 're going to allow the russians to steamroll that country . 
  time to put our guns and bodies in the russians way and see if they 're willing to go to war with the rest of the world . 
  fucking hell that is ridiculous , why does the opposition seems to actually hate their own country and people instead of wanting to improve them ? 
  i do n't hate russia at all , i actually think you 're some of the most impressive people 's in human history and you 've accomplished amazing things . 
  i think you 've made some severely big fuck ups , but you were dealt a rough hand in a rough historical period . 
  and in some ways those fuck ups are justified by the reality of the times . 
  and the current situation is unfortunate , i wo n't pretend that i 'm not opposed to your countries recent actions . 
  but that does n't mean i want to see you wiped from the earth . 
  it 's hard to blame the russian people so much for recent events when it 's clear that the opposition lacks much of a positive vision for the future of your nation . 
  i think you 're missing the point buddy . 
  i 'm not worried about hungarians ** or ** muslims . 
  i was mocking op 's opinion that immigration and islam is in some way responsible for the decline of europe . 
  immigrants are n't your problem , you guys have plenty of problems but immigration is n't one of them . 
  muslims , but do you know what kills more people than muslims every year ? 
  car crashes , heart disease , cancer , infection , major and minor accidents , hell ** police shootings ** . 
  there are very few issues in my country which concern me less than muslim terrorists . 
  i guess i 'm somewhat of a minority in that view but the general opinion in the united states is certainly not anti muslim . 
  anything but , the new york public schools just added a couple of muslim holidays to the school calendar ( do n't worry we already had jewish and christian holidays ) . 
  i 'm scared of cancer , not scared of muslims . 
  hat and pants , always and forever !, 
  just out of curiosity is there ** any ** credible opposition to the mainline government in russia . 
  or is your state literally so monolithic that there is no advertised opposition to main stream opinion ? 
  oh god , you are n't joking . 
  it 's weird to see an entire country with stockholm syndrome . 
  ahhh this old line again `` america invades countries for their oil '' , yaaawn . 
  no , we do n't . 
  we buy iraqi oil just like everyone else , and in fact we do n't buy much oil from the arab states at all . 
  in fact the europeans including the danish mega shipping company maersk are ** heavily ** reliant on that energy . 
  if anything the united states has made it a habit to guarantee the free flow of energy resources in order to maintain the free trade network which is also our invention . 
  the free trade network which has allowed europe to peacefully proper without you guys ripping each others throats out ever two decades ( you know like how you used to behave before we intervened ? ) . 
  if you want to claim that the u.s. is invading countries in order to access their resources ( which is an extremely dubious claim to begin with ) but for now i 'll allow it . 
  the people benefiting from that access are the europeans ** more than ** the americans themselves . 
  it 's pretty laughable if you guys want to claim the moral high ground while benefiting massively from the systems and then decrying the harsh realities that make it possible . 
  when i visited hungary i got punched in the face by a hungarian . 
  the muslims just sold me pizza and schwarma , who should i be more concerned about ? 
  it 's worked pretty well for the swedes . 
  the biggest draw back for them has been the low employment rate ( s ) of child baring age women . 
  but they 've held off the demographic collapse of most of the developed world . 
  tell it to the hungarians . 
  go ask a canadian and a mexican what they think of americans , here 's a hint . 
  we 're friends , very good friends . 
  the border between the united states and canada is the longest undefended border ** in human history ** . 
  that is why russia is the `` evil '' ( your word not mine ) nation , and not the united states . 
  because we allow and even defend the rights of other nations and other peoples . 
  russia by contrast invades anyone not strong enough to stop them takes for itself their land and resources . 
  that 's why , now fuck off putin cock gobbler . 
  well if they are n't russian troops they wo n't mind if the u.s. puts some 500lb bombs down their gullets will they ? 
  after getting permission from the ukrainians first of course . 
  well we can all sleep safe in our beds knowing that wine or lose . 
  we 'll never beat the french at snobbery and at the unjustified sense of superiority . 
   the rich dominate and the poor suffer . 
  nothing changes . 
  for what is life , but a never ending torment that follows us on our way to the grave , ( take drag on cigarette , look profound ) . 
  in the meantime in the real world , yeah shit changes all the time . 
  but if you want to dye your hair black , paint your nails `` vampire red '' and call yourself hagatha of the darkness . 
  that 's fine with me , just remember you 'll always be my little cynthia . 
  do n't forget you 've got ta return your nietzche to the public library before noon on tuesday . 
  that would be a valid argument if this were a one off event . 
  instead the test was repeated again in san francisco after the original testing and the americans won again . 
  it was repeated again in 1986 and the americans won again . 
  and it was repeated a third time in 2006 , and * you guessed it * the americans won ... again . 
  so it 's more like saying the americans are better at basketball because we 've won gold in 14 out of the last 18 olympic games ... 
  it has occurred to be , i just do n't accept the arguments validity . 
  because no matter how much you sub-divide groups there will ** always ** be other even smaller groups who want the right of self determination , the process continues until you end up with individuals and no society at all . 
  further a global order does n't preclude the ability of people 's to make their own decisions . 
  anymore than national laws preclude the abilities of individuals to shape their own future . 
  what national order ** does do ** is establish certain recognized and universally accepted rules . 
  for example laws against war would disallow international violence in the same way that national law impedes interpersonal violence . 
  absolute freedom is little more than the tyranny of strength over weakness . 
  while international order is when nations like iceland and uruguay are seen as having ** the right to exist ** even though they lack the strength to defend themselves . 
  a global order would grant certain inalienable rights to all peoples in the world , but it would thus also establish certain restrictions on those people .
