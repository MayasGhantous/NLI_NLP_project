  i also think they handled it well , and that they 've done all that can be reasonably be expected under the circumstances . 
  i 'm mostly just being a bit vindictive suggesting that they should stiff russia on the bill . 
  i know there are practical reasons why that would n't be a good idea . 
   think again , take a look at the type of country that buys our weapons . 
  russia , egypt , qatar , saudi arabia , india is ok-ish i guess . 
  fair point i guess i wish nations ( including my own ) took a more principled stance on arms sales . 
  though i suppose being too principled about arms sales just gives unprincipled bastards like the russians a big economic edge at weapons research / production / etc. 
  any way , good on france for sticking to its guns with the minstral deal . 
  i 'm assuming that russia is already pretty pissed and unlikely to make any deals with france in the near to mid-term . 
  as for general reliability i guess i would expect most people / nations to recognize that this is an exceptional case . 
  that being said i understand the reasoning behind the decision . 
  i just happen to think that the people are being far to complacent about the annexation of foreign territory . 
  and that this anemic convalescent response from the international community is pretty pathetic . 
  france should at least delay the repayment as long as possible . 
  should russia escalate things in ukraine it 's just another tool in the sanctions bag . 
  yeah , i do n't really understand why france is paying them back . 
  add the money into the sanctions , put it in a folder labeled `` for russia when they give back crimea '' . 
  i doubt anyone who matters is going to be pissed at france for not returning russia 's money at the moment . 
   lol http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/judgment_of_paris_%28wine%29 lol, 
  wow that 's ridiculous comparison , a character is an actual ** invention ** of the people who create that character . 
  why should n't they be entitled to the proceeds of their invention . 
  by contrast a region is no-one 's invention . 
  a butcher in vienna has created ** nothing original ** they are just holding onto a manufactured monopoly that in no way is a product of their own effort . 
  it 's quite clear that one thing is ** intellectual ** property ( intellectual as in the property is a product ** of intellect ** ) . 
  and the other thing is just economic protectionism by claiming that a ubiquitous product is only * actually that product * if it comes from a particular geographic area which is not anyone 's intellectual product . 
   i 've seen some fan-made movies on the web that had a far higher quality than cars 2 or disney 's planes 2 -- but ip law stays ip law . 
  uhh what , so you feel those web-films would be better served if they named their creations `` cars 2 '' or `` planes 2 '' ? 
  or if they claimed they were produced by pixar ? 
  i fail to see what about ip law is preventing other people from competing in the animation film business with pixar . 
  yes their ** name brand ** is protected by ip but a name is hardly comparable to a the only region where you 're allowed to produce a product . 
  because ultimately names are free , and unlimited , while regions are expensive and their is only a finite amount of them . 
  i 'm pretty liberal and while i do n't really buy into american exceptional-ism . 
  the more i 've traveled and learned the more apparent it has become to me that the criticism for american policy is more a product of nationalism dressed up as reasoned criticism . 
  the fact is that american policy has actually been great for ** a lot ** of the world , not least for europe . 
  we 've had seven decades of peace and prosperity un-rivaled by any other time in human history . 
  the europeans hardly have the moral high ground to judge american behavior if you examine the question historically . 
  and in the modern world the only true global actor is the united states . 
  so of course we get criticism all the time . 
  but the criticism is decidedly of the back seat driver nature . 
  i 'm not saying that all the u.s. actions around the world have been justified or good decisions . 
  it 's a complex issue in both moral and practical terms . 
  some people certainly think the most morally justifiable behavior would be to sit on our island and to not intervene in just about anything . 
  this is an interesting perspective for a european since american intervention has most decidedly impacted their lives in what most would consider a positive manner ( considering the history of nazi germany and ussr `` protectorates '' ) . 
  i for one ** would welcome ** a greater degree of european involvement in shaping the global order . 
  but europe has made it clear that its interests are almost entirely internal . 
  which is admirable in some ways , europe has certainly provided a very high standard of living for its people . 
  but that internal focus has come at the cost of external influence , and ability to act . 
  so when it comes to shaping something like a global order the only nation with that ability and with that role is and has long been the united states . 
  in the end the united states global role has come at a great cost to our own people ( 600 billion a year buys a lot of healthcare and high speed rail  ) . 
  and it 's a cost that i personally am happy to pay because despite our many ** many ** mistakes we are at least * trying * to shape the world . 
  and generally the world we have built is better than the one which preceded our existence as a nation . 
  i 'll be more open to european criticism for american policy when i get the impression that the europeans have some moral and political will to shape the world . 
  because i personally am not of the school of thought that inaction and morality are in any way equivalent . 
  that 's not intellectual property , that 's geographical property . 
  you guys are just artificially preserving certain markets based on geography and history rather than their merit . 
  californians make better wine than the french , but the french would rather compete on name brand than on quality . 
  because name brand is easy and guaranteed and quality actually requires extra effort . 
  if we invent it we win at it , if we do n't invent at it , we still win at it . 
  maybe his shit does n't fly with most people but i fucking love the guy . 
  i 'm so tired of the constant bullshitting and making nice which is endemic to politics . 
  people dancing around each other verbally and no one willing to own up to reality because being straightforward is `` rude '' . 
  maybe if we could all just put our bullshit on hold and say it like it is we could get a thing or five done in this world . 
  yep the ssc would still be larger and more powerful than the lhc if we 'd just bothered to fucking finish it . 
  the u.s. public spending policies are bonkers , they 're more about securing widespread support through what amounts to divvying of jobs out to various states . 
  irregardless of efficiency or practical concerns . 
  that being said the eu has encountered similar problems when creating its own trans union partnerships . 
  hopefully lockheed is n't just blowing smoke with its recent fussion claims or the u.s. just sold out its stake in truly next generation energy . 
  well you 're all being gloomy today are n't you ? 
  alright the united states : over the next 15 years growth will remain moderate and somewhat anemic . 
  government budgets will be tight and ambitious public works will be somewhat limited . 
  for the second fifteen years as our demographics heal ( re-invert ) the opposite will occur . 
  our budgets will be flush , ambitious large scale public projects will be attempted or at very least taxes will be lowered across the board . 
  our immigration policies will have liberalized as the growing latino vote causes a political shift on the immigration issue . 
  this trend may be further expanded by our current demographic inversion which will make young / educated immigrants attractive to a u.s. with an abundance of retirees and and stressed budgets . 
  mexico will be our largest trading partner after taking china 's place as the manufacture of note for americas consumer driven economy . 
  cultural immigration will have increased and spanglish will be taught along with english ( kind of a joke but our languages will integrate more ) . 
  mexico 's improved economy and more stable government ( thanks to a more liberal and sane us drug policy ) will make international travel between our countries far more prevelent . 
  an aging canada will still be our close if somewhat less significant partner than they are now . 
  the u.s. will have expanded its absolute military dominance in both absolute and relative terms . 
  with a technological edge not touched by any competing nation at about the 30 year mark the u.s. military dominance will be so clearly absolute we may be able to finally start to de-militarize on a global scale . 
  our current regional rivals will have largely collapsed . 
  russia due to collapsing demographics , internal conflict , and failure to maintain its industrial capabilities . 
  china having been thrown into internal chaos by its own demographic collapse / financial crisis / wealth inequality will no longer be the player on the world stage it is today . 
  our most significant regional competitor will likely be india , which will have long since taken china 's crown with more sustainable and sane growth model ( s ) . 
  but i suspect close cooperation and a greater degree of cultural connection will prevent the sort of tensions we see with china today . 
  instead india will be a partner in an ambitious de-militarization plan being laid out by the u.s. . our allied regional partners will have similarly shrunk in significance . 
  france and the uk will be the most significant eu nations . 
  following the general collapse of the euro and general dissolution of the union . 
  due to a failure to establish a common union goals / understandings and basically because of economic inequality between nations which there is little overall drive to address . 
  the poorer nations will revert to their own currency de-value their labour and live relatively simple lives with a bit less of the sweeping ambitions and dreams of the early 2000 's . 
  in other matter the u.s. foreign policy will have become a bit wiser and more nuanced with several more decades of post cold war practice . 
  hopefully leading to a more democratic peaceful and profitable world ( got ta make money ) . 
  the u.s. will be at the forefront of space exploration and exploitation as u.s. space companies will have largely out competed all competitors during the 20/20 's and competitors in now deminishing countries or regions ( rus and eu ) will largely throw in the towel and contract its own launches with u.s. firms . 
  the u.s. will remain the dominant global power , our culture will likely be more pervasive then ever . 
  hopefully a greater degree of honesty and openness fostered by the internet will drive the u.s. towards ambitious goals of greater global unity . 
  how about the national team ? 
  if we are willing to make msg a sovereign extension of canada do you think we can swing that ? 
  ** we have montreal style bagels in parts of the city now ... **, 
  canada was killing it , they won fair and square and this behavior from the russians is shameful . 
  much love to our northern neighbors , please send spare player to madison square garden , ny , ny , 10001 .
