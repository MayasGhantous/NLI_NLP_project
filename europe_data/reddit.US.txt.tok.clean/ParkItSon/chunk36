  the rangers need your help ... edit : also if you want you can replace the knicks too there is no way you 'll make that team any worse . 
  hey at least we 're open about it . 
  liberal weenie here , if russia invades one of our allies i 'll be screaming for blood . 
   if any shit goes down , decisions wo n't be made by texans with their ar-15s , the decisions will be made in dc . 
  and those decisions may be different . 
  one thing that people do n't understand about u.s. politics is that just because we 're * internally * bickering all of the time does n't mean that we are n't ** very ** unified . 
  if there were ever a direct attack on a u.s. ally that would be very much viewed as a direct attack on the united states . 
  it would take all of a heart beat for gun toting texans and brooklyn hipsters to be on exactly the same page on that issue . 
  there would be massive pressure on washington to act from the left / right / center . 
  there would be no way for any u.s. political party to conceivably back down unless they wanted to be blasted into obsolescence . 
   if resources were meaningful then russia would n't be a poor society resources can massively contribute to the wealth of a society . 
  but if all of the money from those resources ultimately ends up in the hands of a few oligarchs you 're never going to have a robust economy . 
  you need resources ** and ** a functional and pluralistic society , or you 're just going to end up with a few very rich people and general mass poverty . 
   japan , britain britain did n't conquer the world for the fun of it , they conquered the world for the resources which were ultimately shipped back to britain . 
  the japanese conquest of se asia during / prior to wwii was also conquest for resources . 
  it was the u.s. embargo on oil sales to japan which prompted the attack on pearl harbor . 
  since the end of wwii and the beginning of the brenton woods era having commodity type resources actually in your national boundaries is no longer a pre-requisite . 
  because the united states has guaranteed access to global markets for much of the world . 
  allowing countries to leverage less tangible resources ( like human ingenuity and societal strength ) into tangible wealth . 
  but in the end the resources are still ** critical ** to the success of an industrialized nation . 
  that 's why i said depending on how calculate . 
  if you include illegal imports through mexico ( see * drugs ) that 's a metric shit ton of money . 
  china is a huge importer but in bi-lateral terms our trade with mexico is robust and growing much more rapidly than our imports from china . 
  the fact that mexico is relatively poor compared to canada is going to likely to make them our largest trading partner very soon ( mexico 's manufacturing sector is exploding and just look at the rate of foreign direct investment going into that country ) . 
  canadians are hella old and mexicans are quite young which means as a future consumer base mexico is much more promising than aging canada ( excluding the young albertans ) . 
  give it 5 or 10 years and mexico will be our largest trading partner , and i 'd be willing to place money on that bet . 
  americans do n't forget they 're our largest ( or second largest depending on how you do the math ) trading partner . 
  they 'll almost certainly be our largest trading partner in the next few years . 
  but the mexican and european economies are n't so deeply connected it 's not that surprising if you do n't think about mexico too much . 
   sort of worked for the nazis . 
  well not really , they were occupying places which were notably un-armed . 
  hell the soviets were sending un-armed soldiers into stalingrad with the intent of using the weapons of the already dead . 
  if the nazis had been attempting to occupy the us they would have a * significantly * harder time . 
   you just bomb their cities and let them freeze/starve to death , do reprisal executions , haul people off to death camps . 
  like i said , so long as you 're literally willing to ** kill everyone ** winning a war is n't so hard . 
  i 'm assuming that whole sale execution of the entire population would n't be considered acceptable . 
  it would be scary , especially since gun ownership tends to split along political lines . 
  if there were ever a civil war it would probably be pretty unbalanced . 
  ahh so this is n't actually a projection , it 's more of an opinion piece aimed at precipitating political changes . 
  i know demography is ( compared to most things ) quite predictable but attempting to predict out to 2060 is a bit cocky . 
  you 've got to assume that a lot of factors ( some of them political and very unpredictable ) remain stable . 
  i mean current events today , the eu is discussing refugee quotas . 
  great britain has the right to basically veto any demands on it to accept refugees . 
  that one event ** alone ** could have a huge impact on a 45 year demographic prediction . 
  when a single political decision can have a such a massive impact and we 're talking about such a long range prediction . 
  i 'd take this forecast with a heaping spoon of salt . 
  the population of all of switzerland is significantly less than the population of new york city . 
  the united states is unique in having both a very large population and an absolutely staggering number guns ( more than a quarter billion of them ) . 
  tell it to the every insurgent force that 's ever defeated the u.s. military , ie * the most powerful and technologically advanced military which has ever existed in the human history . 
  we still basically * lost * in vietnam , iraq , afghanistan etc. 
  you could also bring up the arguments with the russians who lost the first chechen war despite having vastly superior weapons and technology . 
  unless you were literally willing to kill ** everyone ** there would be no way to ever win a war on the mainland united states . 
  we are quite literally the most heavily armed people on the planet . 
  people seriously over estimate the ability of even a highly advanced military to pacify a large population . 
  even if that population is n't particularly well armed . 
   but the usa did the same with cuba/iran / ah right , our 51st and 52nd states . 
   i bet this attitude would evaporate the second the usa loses a war against a foreign aggressor on american soil . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country it 's hard to lose a war on your own territory when the entire population is basically a 300 million strong army in itself . 
  i 've been shooting guns my whole life , and i 'm tree hugging , vegetarian , liberal . 
   this is a subjective thing but i think that the main focus of the documentary is to show how false information , fake images , fake info , ( lies to put it in one word ) were told to the population as justification for the war . 
  fair enough , but in my opinion at least justifying a morally justifiable war with lying is fine with me . 
  i 'm not really a moral absolutist , i think there 's always going to be a fair amount of people who would rather bury their heads in the sand then intervene in anything . 
  for example the u.s. involvement in wwi was heavily influenced by less than honest political maneuvering to drum up support for the war . 
  but i still believe that involvement was a good thing . 
  while honesty , pacific-ism , etc. 
  all sound great on paper these moral traits are n't so great if you allow atrocities to be committed through apathy . 
   except that it was n't serbia that was doing that . 
  alright bosnian serbs , which had a significant amount of support from serbia ( even if the serbian nation was not directly aware of or in control ) . 
  the u.s. has installed it 's fair share of military junta 's and even though we did n't murder all of those people ourselves i would still say we 're responsible for it . 
  if you give a murdering bastard a truck load of guns you 're responsible for it when they go off and kill innocents with them . 
   serbia did not start the war in kosovo that 's like saying the u.s. did n't start the war in afghanistan after 9/11 . 
  we may have been justified in starting the war , but we were still the ones who started it . 
  a terrorist attack by some militia does n't qualify as starting a war . 
  it 's when the actual military gets involved . 
  that all being said , i here your opinions and i 'm not beyond being swayed to a degree at least . 
  i can certainly see your side of the argument , and i do n't think anyone in the conflict was above blame . 
  lets just hope in the future things can be handled more peacefully . 
  yep , if there 's going to be a war you can be damn sure that we 'll invite ourselves . 
  things have changed since the winter war . 
  i mentioned this in / r/europe before but the u.s. does n't tend to hold grudges in regards to military conflicts . 
  we have a war , the war decides something and we move on . 
  that being said we still view the war as a very significant event , but not necessarily as something which implies on going negative relations . 
  the marshall plan , the fall of the berlin wall , these are all seen as consequences of the war to some degree . 
  so if you were to ask me what event was the most important in u.s. german relationships the answer would definitely be ww2 . 
  that does n't mean i view our relationship in terms of war but that event is what set the course the relationship which we have today . 
  the fact that they need to keep a tug boat with their aircraft carrier in case the engine breaks down . 
  that 's pretty fucking funny . 
  alright i watched the documentary and my opinion has n't really been shifted . 
  the whole thing just comes across as german hand wringing and knit picking over the fact that not enough people were dead yet to justify and intervention . 
  i do n't really care if all of the facts and figures about numbers dead were n't accurate . 
  i think the u.s. learned their lesson after the bosnian civil war ( you know the one where you guys were committing genocide and shelling cities ? ) . 
  the us took a ton of flack for not intervening sooner during that conflict and we were n't content to just sit around this time . 
  i think peoples who commit ethnic cleansing should not expect a great deal of understanding when they start up a second war just a few years after the last one is concluded . 
  and finally i think the low casualty counts are a perfect example of why we ** should ** get involved . 
  the last thing we need is another holocaust where everyone claims that such things are impossible until we find out the claims were accurate an a lot of innocents are dead . 
  do n't start a genocide in 1992 and expect me to believe you 're the victims in 1999 . 
   it has only one engine though as opposed to two on the hornet so its survivability is n't as good in cases of engine failure in this day and age single engines have actually been shown to be more reliable . 
  engines have gotten so good that the most common cause of failure is human error during maintenance . 
  halving the number of engines halves the probability of someone fucking up . 
  and since engine failures are quite often so catastrophic that a single engine failure is often enough to bring down the plane .
