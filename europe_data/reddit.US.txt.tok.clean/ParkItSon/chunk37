  the whole issue of 2 engines for survivability is now not so clear as it once was . 
  all fair points , any way i 'm not trying to argue with you , just trying to offer my perspective . 
  but coming back to the original point of this conversation . 
  i do not believe there is any significant bias in the u.s. government and certainly not in the u.s. electorate against serbia . 
  and the concept that greater albania would in some way be in our interests is pretty laughable . 
  i very much doubt that the u.s. is at all interested at border re-definition in that region . 
  and there 's just no benefit in a greater albania for the u.s. 
  fair enough point but japan did attack u.s. territory ( without warning and without actual military provocation ) . 
  great britain was a colonial overlord that burnt down our capital in 1812 . 
  and then the u.s. civil war was also fought on our territory . 
  the first battle of the war was fought at a place called manasas , you should visit . 
  we built a shopping mall on top of the old battlefield . 
  any way i 'm not saying that you 're wrong , our isolation and the fact that wars are fought `` over there '' certainly does n't hinder our ability to just get over it . 
  it also does n't hurt that the concept of an ethnic conflict is pretty foreign to americans . 
  our national identity is an amorphous philosophical concept more than anything else . 
  an american is anyone who wants to be an american . 
  when america goes to war it does n't go to war because the people were going after are from a different river basin or mountain valley . 
  we go to war because you 've got something we want , or because you did something we do n't like , or because you once tried to assassinate the presidents father ( bad move on saddam 's part there ) . 
  again i 'm not claiming moral superiority , nothing about the above means america 's wars are inherently more just . 
  but the attitude behind the wars is very different . 
  here there 's a bit of `` nothing personal , just business '' . 
  europe , * particularly * in the balkans . 
  there 's this palpable attitude of `` the other side are a bunch of sub-human bastards '' . 
  people are very much aware of their ethnicity and their religion and that is often more important than their national identity . 
  when conflict is personal and deeply linked to your identity it 's a lot harder not to take things personally . 
  i 'll watch it tonight and let you know . 
  meh the u.s. does n't have a long history of continued dislike of foreign foes . 
  we literally nuked japan , then so aggressively supported them with economic aid an access that they ( to this day ) out compete u.s. domestic products in many industries . 
  holding a grudge is n't really the u.s. style , especially against a tiny country like serbia . 
  here 's what president truman said when asked what made him proudest about his presidency :  that we totally defeated our enemies and then brought them back to the community of nations as equals . 
  in my experience with europeans they are ** much ** more focused on and interested with the past than most americans are . 
  in america we can have a war , the war decides something and then we move on . 
  and not just when we win either , after the vietnam war which is widely regarded as our ** worst ** most psychologically scarring war . 
  we 've now returned to entirely normal and even quite close relations with vietnam . 
  and i think you 'd be hard pressed to find many americans who have a negative view of vietnam . 
  the american view of war is that you have a war , it decides * something * and then you move on . 
  the whole concept of holding a grudge just for the sake of holding a grudge is pretty alien to us . 
  i 've seen it a lot more in europe , hungarians are still pretty bitter about the fact that they do n't have transylvania anymore . 
  and that shit happened almost a century ago , and it was decided by a vote . 
  i 'm not arguing that americans are super ethical or anything . 
  but holding a grudge for so long just is n't profitable and profit comes first . 
  also these places are far away it 's hard to stay bitter when your former enemy lives across an ocean . 
  as far as i know the embargo on cuba is the longest grudge america has ever stuck to , and that 's mostly because they 're our neighbors . 
  and because cubans in the u.s. are an important voting block and they are ** very ** anti castro . 
  there 's no political pressure to be anti-serbian though , so i very much doubt that any u.s. politicians have much if any bias towards serbs or serbia . 
  do the citizens in those countries also receive a toll rebate on their taxes ? 
  yep , we 're a giant island both of our neighbors are extremely friendly and we have n't been invaded for over 200 years . 
  very little about the world map has any significant impact on most amercicans lives . 
  i personally know a lot about geography and global politics because i 'm interested . 
  but america as a whole is mostly apathetic about what is happening in the rest of the world . 
  for an american almost everything that happens in the world is `` over there '' . 
  that 's why it 's semi ridiculous for serbians to think there is any sort of bias against serbia in the u.s. . we do n't care enough to even generate bias . 
  there 's bias about countries like saudi arabia and iran , but about serbia , most people do n't even know that serbia exists and if you told them they 'd probably think it 's in the middle east . 
  the only reason serbs might think america knows about them is because we once spent a few weeks bombing them . 
  which i imagine had more impact on the serbian psyche than that of the americans . 
  i 'm just trying to point out that just because we bombed them does n't imply a long lasting i 'll will / bias / or even awareness of their existence . 
  and so whining about the lack of attention to an albanian terrorist attack in macedonia as being evidence of some anti serbian policy is laughable . 
  they presumably pay vehicle taxes in their own country correct ? 
  taxes that you do n't pay . 
  just because the toll payment is subsidized through a tax rebate does n't mean it is n't subsidized . 
  it 's subsidized through a tax rebate which is only available to germans . 
  this is a pretty damn blatant example of a tax on foreigners ( see non voters ) to fix german infrastructure . 
  what do we want , better roads !, 
  who should pay for them ? 
  someone else !, 
  i get the strong impression that what he wants is ( really ) for everyone to apologize for intervening in the serbian genocide . 
  and he 's holding up the example of the recent attacks as proof that the serbs really were n't all that bad , and that we should be judging the albanians just as harshly as we judged the serbs . 
  i 'm not so naive to imagine that ** anyone ** in the balkans conflicts was / were entirely innocent . 
  but i feel safe in saying that the serbs were by far the most effective at mass murder . 
  and i fully stand by my countries decision to intervene and end the conflict . 
  i think that some serbs feel like they 've been * unfairly * cast as the bad guys in those conflicts . 
  and now they would like it recognized that the situation was n't so black and white . 
  i understand the feelings but at this point i think they should just ** move on ** . 
  the ethnic cleansing by serbs was n't justified , and they 're not going to get an apology for nato intervention . 
  it 's time for serbia to move on , accept the outcome of the past , and to go forward in a more positive and constructive way . 
  he said she said stories about a two decades old war are n't productive . 
  dude do you want to know the hard truth , it 's not some crazy anti-serbian proganda . 
  it 's more like we do n't know about , and do not care about your country . 
  just because we were breifly at war with you a few decades ago does n't matter . 
  we do n't remember it , most people here ca n't point to albania or serbia on a map . 
  we do n't have any understanding of or interest in your ethnic conflicts or prejudices . 
  we 're not on anyone 's side so long as there is no more genocide going on in the region no one here , in the media or out of it , ** cares ** . 
  if your country wants to join the eu by all means you should . 
  best of luck to you . 
  but no one in the u.s. is interested in your opinions on greater albania . 
  do what you think is best for your nation but if you 're looking for some international opinion adjustment you 're out of luck . 
  wow ... 
  ahh so pointing out that the eu does n't have anything * resembling * a unified foreign policy stance is now a conspiracy theory ? 
  hell the eu nations are barely managing to keep a unified front on sanctions . 
  a year after a european nation was invaded and annexed and you ca n't even get people to stick to fairly minor sanctions . 
  the f-35 gets massive criticism like the osprey took massive criticism . 
  until the problems were fixed , and now it 's considered to be an extremely reliable and useful aircraft . 
  building new shit is hard , the f-35 is basically 3 new aircraft , of course there are going be problems . 
  it just so happens that the media has no incentive to keep problems in perspective . 
  saying `` the f-35 is having some minor engine problems during high angle of attack maneuvers . 
  engineers are working on a fix '' . 
  generates way fewer page views than , `` the new trillion dollar u.s. stealth fighter can not fly due to engine failures ! '' . 
  also precautionary choices during testing are re-branded as a total lack of functionality . 
  for example due to some concern over lighting resistance they 've chosen not to do training around thunderstorms until they 've worked out a solution . 
  odds are the plane is perfectly safe to fly through thunderstorms .
