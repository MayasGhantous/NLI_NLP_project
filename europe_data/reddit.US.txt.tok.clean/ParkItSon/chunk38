  the testers are just being cautious with multi million dollar pieces of equipment . 
  but in the eyes of the media prudence is re-branded as `` newest jet ca n't fly in the rain '' or some equivalent silliness . 
  also claiming that russia is building anything like the f-35 is fucking laughable . 
  the pak-fa has been a prototype forever and it does n't seem likely that it 'll be anything more than one for quite some time ( if ever ) . 
  the historical similarities between this and the german annexation of austria are pretty damn good . 
  the european desire for peace above all else is also pretty damn similar to the period post wwi . 
  russia could march into kiev tomorrow and there would be no unified response from the eu . 
  i 'm not saying there would n't be a response but the members will be all over the map with how severe that response should be . 
  i very much doubt there would be ** anything ** like a concerted effort or desire for any sort of military intervention . 
  shhh this is europe , they still have n't learned the lessons of appeasement since the last time . 
  i was reading that after the most recent currency collapse alcoholics ( of which there are many ) have been buy various vodka `` substitutes '' many of which are less than healthy . 
  if you want them by all means take them , i can accept the fact that certain actions are beyond forgiveness and beyond redemption . 
  right you are n't adult enough to understand that imolating a human being is wrong . 
  i think i 'm done here . 
  12 years old , what about 13 , 14 , 15 ? 
  at what point is anyone responsible for their actions , certainly not at the age of 19 when you just burn your girlfriend alive on a crazy youthful whim ? 
  `` oh your honor i was 19 i did n't realize how wrong my actions were but now i 'm 20 and burning people alive is obviously wrong ! '' . 
   maybe you should move to the usa new york ai n't on the danube . 
  i 'm a liberal person but there comes a point where i just stop caring . 
  i do n't really care if you 're fucked in the head , i do n't really care if you 're 12 years old . 
  if you and your friend can orchestrate a pre-meditated cold blooded murder , that 's it , you 're done . 
  i 'm against the death penalty on the simple basis that it 's expensive and it 's a mistake that ca n't be undone . 
  i 'm against america 's insanely liberal incarceration policies and the abject failure of our rehabilitation system . 
  and the fact that being a `` criminal '' is an almost permanent state of being that makes relapse a near certainty . 
  but i have zero problem with life without parole incarceration for cold blooded murderors and rapists . 
  at a certain point i just do n't fucking care what your excuse is , it honestly just does n't matter , you might be undeveloped , you might be insane , you might just have a total lack of empathy . 
  but at some point there is just no reason to allow certain people to ever be a part of society again . 
  [ if you burn your pregnant girlfriend to death because you do n't want to be a father ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/man-burns-pregnant-girlfriend-alive-because-he-did-not-want-to-be-father-germany-a6888806.html ) you should never , never , be released from prison and `` i was 19 at the time '' is not an excuse . 
   while true , that 's more to it 's benefit than it 's detriment . 
  reliability of later launches is more important for customers , not what happened a decade ago . 
  all i 'm saying is that is a shaky leg to stand on , there 's no indication that space x ( or other future competitors ) wo n't achieve the reliability of ariane-5 ( which is certainly exemplory ) . 
  and make no bones about it i 'm 100 % happy and impressed ariane-5 is reliable as it is . 
  it will after all be the ride for the james webb telescope which i ** really ** do not want to become a firey ball of rubble . 
  i just do n't think reliability alone will keep them competive much further into the future . 
  simply because there is no reason to suspect that other manufactures wo n't be able to match and possibly exceed that level of reliability . 
   afaik , focus is entirely on the ariane 6 . 
  what i 've heard as well , but i 've even spoken with some ariane space engineers ( younger ones ) who are worried about the relatively slow pace of development . 
  some people in the organization feel that they 're moving too slowly with next generation capabilities . 
  but they 're a big organization and the opinions of engineers at the bottom of the totem poll are n't likely to swing priorities at the top for some time . 
  falcon 9 currently has a better track record than the ariane 5 considering their current stage of development ( number of launches ) ariane space had already had two complete launch failures and two partial launch failures at the falcon 9 's current launch numbers . 
  one half of space x 's current failure rate , also the space x partial failure almost certainly could have been corrected if it were n't for iss safety protocols . 
  reusability and reliability are n't mutually exclusive . 
  in fact being able to examine your rocket after flight gives you a huge opportunity to find poetential failure points that you just ca n't find if the rocket is in a 1000 pieces at the bottom of the ocean . 
  i 'm not saying ariane 5 is a bad rocket , just that greater reliability is not likely to remain a unique attribute going into the future . 
  there is no reason to suspect that space x and the falcon 9 ( and eventually the falcon heavy ) ca n't at least meet a5 's reliability , and there is a real possibility that recovery may allow them to build the most thouroughly tested and understood rocket ever made . 
  i hope ariane space feels pressure to push forward the clock on their reusability studies , it 's past time we had another space race . 
  the problem is mission creep , the moment you leave these things up to interpretation the acceptable definition of privacy begins to erode . 
  so you 're argument is because the u.s. is n't exemplary in all things it is ironic for an american to make criticisms of europeans ? 
  the u.s. has problems with our criminal justice system , i do n't dispute that . 
  europe however has deep systemic problems in regards to freedom of speech and in my opinion regarding a number of other civili liberties . 
  by all means criticize the american criminal justice system , i find it dispicable in more ways than i can easily count . 
  i however also feel that euroepan policies curtail civil liberties and justify these curtailments under he guise of promoting the public good . 
  well unless islam is in control of the danish government i know who i 'd blame . 
  yes because the holocaust was the idea of americans . 
  you 're right do n't want those pesky humans getting in the way of the great society . 
  portugal is the best country in europe , and i mean that with absolute seriousness . 
  only country in europe i could actually live in . 
  you know that electric drive , means that the ship uses diesel burning generators to create electricity to drive those electric engines right ? 
  they are n't battery powered , more like a hybrid car . 
  still more efficient and less polluting but not exactly green . 
  ahh right raumpatrouille , i always forget about raumpatrouille . 
  they are building two queen elizabeth class carriers . 
  they are both both stovl carriers ( short takeoff vertical landing ) . 
  they will each operate f-35b 's as well as helicopters . 
  they are somewhat similar ( but more specialized for flight operations ) to our wasp and america class of amphibious assault ships which will also deploy the f-35b . 
  the queen elizabeth class are however longer and considerably larger in terms of weight / displacement . 
  the queen elizabeth also has a ski ramp configuration to improve air wing deployment capability . 
  the queen elizabeth class is not comparable to the nimitz class or the gerald r ford class which are both catobar ( catapult assisted take off but arrested recovery ) carriers . 
  they are also lighter / smaller by between 30,000 and 40,000 long tons . 
  that all being said the queen elizabeth class will be some of the most effective carriers in the world , only eclipsed by the nimitz , ford , they are perhaps in something of a dead heat with the charles degaulle ( another catobar ) which has the advantage of nuclear power and launch assist , though it is considerably smaller and also less advanced in some areas . 
  edit : stobar to stovl , the queen elizabeth class are not currently outfitted with arresting equipment . 
  they are only outfitted to recover vertical landing capable aircraft at this time . 
   and here is another example of my slowness , writing this post took me 25 goddamn hours in the span of 12 days . 
  the reason for that could be that for a long time i 've struggled with putting my thoughts into words but i do n't know . 
  keep practicing , it 'll get easier !, 
  even if practicing just means making comments on reddit . 
  i started posting my worthless opinions in various online forums and message boards when i was 14 . 
  and while i could have done something more productive things with the thousands of hours i 've spent doing it since . 
  i can at least say that i am far better and far quicker writer than most people i know . 
  also learn your punctuation , i still do n't know mine and it fucking haunts me . 
  apparently there is a short and simple book called `` the elements of style '' . 
  have n't read it , probably never will , too busy sharing my brilliance with the world , you 're welcome . 
  in the u.s. ignore them , unless you 're a leftist revolutionary , in which case give them a slightly mean but inconspicuous look and mutter `` fuck the police coming straight from the underground '' under your breath . 
  the frontier era, 
   i mean there 's literally no upside for the us to invest in the defense of eastern europe besides long term stability of nato , but who thinks long term anymore ? 
  well the baltic people 's are pretty cool and unlike most of europe they 're actually grateful for the aid which we provide , which is surprisingly referencing . 
  a bit racist sometimes but i can understand a little discomfort from such a homogenous country . 
  basically i 'm saying we should protect the baltics because their pretty cool . 
  laid back , hardworking people without the superiority complex so much of europe has . 
  and they 've mostly got proper free speech too , not the watered down socially approved speech bullshit . 
  let 's keep them !, 
  i like them and they 're so cute and little < 3 < 3 . 
  well maybe she deserves at least some of the attitude . 
  for one thing her poise and diction while articulating her point and then responding to a question , all while on television and in front of a massive crowd . 
  not a single ummm , not a single mumble , just clear and commanding and she 's 16 . 
  i could n't do better in her shoes so maybe if she 's a cocky little shit she 's done something to earn it . 
   chechnya is now objectively better off in russia than it is outside of it and that can change , like if russians number one export declines in value by 70 to 80 percent . 
  or if russians rapidly aging demography causes further economic harm as the workforce shrinks . 
  i love how americans get the reputation for being short sighted and naive ( as one of the younger countries on earth ) . 
  but at least unlike eurpeans or eurasians we do n't think that mankind is permanently altered by a temporary change in circumstance .
