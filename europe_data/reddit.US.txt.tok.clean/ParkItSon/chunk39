  chechens have been rebelling against the russian empire for hundreds of years , so when people say things like `` that all changed because of some policy we implemented 20 years ago '' . 
  well let 's just say i take it with an atlas mountain sized pinch of salt . 
   seriously , i do not think people realize how brutal the first world war was . 
  i doubt either population are hoping for more conflict ( that translates not re-arming and seeking diplomatic solutions to conflict whenever we can ) since we 've got such a bitter , painful , taste of war feels like . 
  why despite all the evidence to the contrary do people insist that conflict will end once everyone knows just how bad it is . 
  ww1 ** the war to end all wars ** did n't bring about that end , ww2 did n't either . 
  conflict mostly ceased after ww2 not because people learned their lessons but because the power dynamics had shifted . 
  humanity has not learned its lessons yet , and everyone who has ever claimed they have has been proven wrong in time . 
  your entire premise is that the chechens wo n't rise up again because the last time and the time before that was so horrible . 
  my evidence is that the chechens have been rising up for a thousand years or more . 
  chechnya was never going to be quiet forever and kadyrov is on the shit list of everyone who sees russia as the foreign occupier . 
  kadyrov probably wants to get out of town before the inevitable next chechen uprising when he will be tortured to death as a fifth columnist . 
  if you think i 'm joking i invite you to take a short examination of chechen history . 
  the chechens have been fighting external occupiers for ** milenia ** . 
  chechnya has a birth rate almost double greater russia and even more when considering ethnic russians . 
  as russia 's economic and demographic woes increase another chechen uprising is coming , it 's only a question of when . 
  kadyrov has utilized kremlin support and brutal violence to forestall things , but given the decline in the russian population , its current military extension ( perhaps over extension ) and of course the long term collapse in oil prices ( us fracking has broken the high oil forever paradigm ) . 
  well i think kadyrov is perhaps picking his moment . 
   then our leaders could n't make excuses translation : `` the americans will have to respond because failure to respond threatens their security guarantees on a global level . '', 
  `` meanwhile , european powers will council against an over reaction in favor of a diplomatic summit and a fact finding missions '' . 
  here is band-aid , it is use but still good . 
   for example , your analogy does n't take into account the context of the relationships or the amount of information both parties have about what happened . 
  or even that the us addmited the pilot was wrong and still gave him a metal . 
  all these things matter . 
  oh so ** now ** you want to account for extra and external factors . 
  when your previous argument was that regardless of those factors the end result was the same so they do n't matter . 
  i 'm done with this argument . 
  honestly dude , it 's a pretty damn perect analogy , and you just ca n't admit that you are obviously and objectively wrong here . 
  we did n't apologize and we really really should , never to late to say sorry and all that . 
  we did take responsibility and we did pay reparations . 
  but we should still apologize . 
  three scenarios . 
  1 ) i accidentally hit someone with my car , that person is killed . 
  i drive away , and do everything in my power to hide my crime . 
  2 ) i hit someone with my car , that person is killed . 
  i stop my car , call the police , and wait for them to arrive . 
  i acknowledge that i hit and killed a person with my car but i do n't admit guilt or take full responsibility as the guilty party . 
  i keep my mouth shut , i lawyer up , and i let the legal system work . 
  i 'm not charged with any major crime , basically i 'm given a ticket for wreckless driving and my insurance goes up . 
  i 'm sued by the family of the individual i l killed in civil court and i reach a settlement for damages with the family . 
  3 ) i hit someone with my car , that person is killed . 
  i stop and call the police , i admit to the police that i hit and killed the person , that i was speeding and i ignored a red light . 
  i admit that my negligence is responsible for accident and i apologize to the family of the dead pedestrian . 
  i am found guilty of negligent manslaughter , and i spend a year in prison before getting out on parole for good behavior . 
  i pay the family for the damages incurred by the loss of life . 
  ** now ** do all of these scenarios have `` the same outcome '' as you would say or are they all the same both practically and morally ? 
  because after all at the end of the day in all three of these scenarios the result is the same 1 dead person , one family without a loved one . 
  ahh so you 're one of the americans who think that everyone in the world who does like us does n't like us because `` we fucked up their country '' . 
  iran has lots of reasons to be hostile towards us , some are legitimate , some are n't . 
  it is n't illegitimate for ** us ** to feel hostility towards them for attacking us in beiruit or for taking over 400 american citizens hostage . 
  the fact that iran may have some legitimate grievances does n't make that ok , and does n't mean that we do n't have a legitimate grievance as a result of their actions . 
  life is complicated like that . 
  but you 're full of shit if you 're trying to claim intent and response do not have an influence on the meaningful result of an event . 
  the iran air downing was a tragedy and a national disgrace , but the way we handed it ** does matter ** . 
   the result is the same . 
  um no , the result is not `` the same '' . 
   in february 1996 , the united states agreed to pay iran us$ 131.8 million in settlement to discontinue a case brought by iran in 1989 against the u.s. in the international court of justice relating to this incident , [ 33 ] together with other earlier claims before the iran-united states claims tribunal . 
  [ 15 ] us$ 61.8 million of the claim was in compensation for the 248 iranians killed in the shoot-down : $ 300,000 per wage-earning victim and $ 150,000 per non-wage-earner . 
  in total , 290 civilians on board were killed , 38 being non-iranians and 66 being children . 
  it was not disclosed how the remaining $ 70 million of the settlement was apportioned , though it appears a close approximation of the value of a used a300 jet at the time . 
  i am not proud of the fact that we did n't apologize , it 's blatantly clear to me that we were in the wrong and should have apologized . 
  i also think it 's pretty clear that william c. rogers ( the captain ) should have been severely disciplined and demoted rather than receiving any honors . 
  he was criticized by others under his command for being overly aggressive , seems like the man was looking for a fight and miraculously found one . 
  so no , i 'm not claiming what my country did was perfect or that we did the full and unabashed right thing . 
  but ** we did ** admit fault , and ** we did ** compensate the families of the victims and the iranian government . 
  despite the fact that we viewed them as a hostile nation that had attacked us , and despite the fact that ** no one on earth ** could have ** compelled ** us to pay the reparations that we did . 
  well by all means if netflix sucks in your country and there are better options available go with the better option . 
  that is after all what capitalism is all about , if netflix ca n't cut it , they should lose . 
  but i have n't yet encountered any * legal * alternatives in europe that are vastly better . 
  so until i hear about that i 'm going to assume that things will sort of go the way they did in america over the last few years . 
  basically netflix streaming sucked , so some people had it but it was a supplement to illegal services . 
  as it got better many more people signed up for the service and kept it permanently , though they continue to supplement the content with streaming and torrents . 
  finally things hit a sort of critical mass where there is enough ** good ** content on netflix that even though they do n't have everything you want you 're often willing to watch something else ( on netflix ) and you 'll wait until that other thing you want is legally available ( rather than going to a streaming site to watch it in shake cam ) . 
  the problem is that there are conflicting elements within what is generally defined as liberalism . 
  liberal humanism demands a level of empathy to fellow human beings are suffering and in need of aid . 
  thus liberalism requires us to offer assistance to those who are less fortunate than us . 
  but same elements liberalism empathy and equality between humans , encourages a philosophical belief in ** cultural ** empathy and equality which discourages a belief in relative superiority or inferiority between cultures . 
  thus policies and words like `` assimilation '' are seen as negative because it is a tacit acknowledgement of cultural inequality and specifically it is a tacit acknowledge of cultural superiority ( you need to be more like us , because we are better ) . 
  the problem as i see it is that ** human rights and equality ** , are not ** necessarily ** compatible with ** cultural rights and equality ** . 
  because elements of some cultures or elements of those cultures ( and i am not excluding my own culture from this criticism ) are incompatible with human rights . 
  the problem as with so many things comes down to absolutism and extremism , it 's just that this time that absolutism and extremism is coming from elements of the liberal left . 
  people fail to understand that applying ideals to their logical ( or illogical ) extreme often invalidates the original idea . 
  in this case applying liberal ideals of equality and tolerance to their logical extreme actually acts to encourage attitudes and behaviors that are intolerant and inequitable . 
  to fulfill the intent of liberalism we need to always seek a balance between principals that can eclipse each other . 
  a willingness to respect the differences between culture and values is important , it is not my job to tell everyone else how to live their lives . 
  but at the same time a refusal to occasionally impose our principles on others is and abandonment of the very same principles that demand my respect for other 's personal decisions on how they want to live . 
  ultimately i think we must impose the liberal values that demand equality of choice , and safety , ** for everyone ** . 
  so long as these rights are guaranteed i support your right to live how you want , so long as your choices do not impinge on these fundamental tenants of freedom of choice and freedom from threat of violence or harm . 
  if your culture demands that you infringe on these basic tenants than unfortunately those elements of your culture can not coexist with mine and you need to either change your culture and assimilate , or you need to get out . 
   they still execute homosexuals yet reddit seems to think iran is some type of progressive utopia . 
  reddit is filled with contrarians , a lot of people like to tout the belief that america is the the greatest source of global evil and tyranny . 
  thus countries that oppose the u.s. are progressive freedom fighters who refuse to be subjected to the global / imperialist / capitalists . 
  it 's part of regressive liberalism , a mindset where all of the tenants of human rights and secularism are discarded because `` western ideals '' are in some way fundamentally corrupt / un-natural / un-spiritual . 
  regressive liberals use the fact that the west is imperfect , as a means to excuse the behavior of everyone who is n't in the west . 
  so while a failure to pursue homosexual rights in america is an example of western corruption and immorality . 
  for america to then attempt to impose those standards on others is fundamentally wrong because the west itself is corrupt , and other cultures are more `` in tune '' and more `` natural '' or more `` authentic '' . 
  it 's actually pretty fucking pathetic , i am 100 % supportive of those who criticize the many many failings of morality and principal in my own country . 
  but i find it disgusting when people use our imperfection as a means to excuse the actions of others because `` we are n't perfect '' . 
  i wonder if people realize that is how netflix streaming ** started ** in the us , it took them years of negotiating with content providers to get where they are today . 
  eh , netflix streaming in the u.s. was pretty shitty when it started off .
