  does n't really make senses they would try to compete with a company that does . 
  especially considering the size of the market . 
  also a big part of the of the `` magic '' was presumably software related any way . 
  i 'm guessing they already checked in the recent past so they do n't feel the need to go over it again . 
  safety problems hurt a few people , environmental `` problems '' like this hurt everyone . 
  you 're under estimating just how screwed they are man . 
  vw is in the ** wrong state ** to apply any sort of meaningful political pressure . 
  because frankly no one give a flying fuck about tennessee , and very few law makers or regulators will go to bat for vw . 
  they do n't give a shit about vw , foreign company , the only people who care are going to be people with vw factories in their districts and they do n't punch heavy . 
  there 's no fall guy for this , it 's a blatant and intentional fraud , at least with the other recent car scandals you can claim apathy or ignorance for not fixing the problem ( s ) . 
  vw can claim ** neither ** because this was literally something they designed into the cars systems . 
  and did we mention that recently the justice department has made big moves about criminally prosecuting ceo 's and executives ? 
  it 's quite possible that the u.s. will attempt to extradite people for prison sentences over this . 
  i did n't say it was a worse issue , i said that the oil spill ** was an accident ** . 
  losing control of a vehicle , and causing a major car wreck which kills 10 people is worse in terms of human life cost than murdering a single person . 
  but murdering one person in cold blood is probably going to land you with a far harsher legal punishment . 
  even if you were say speeding when the accident occurred you still did n't intend to cause harm . 
  it 's the difference between first degree murder ( vw ) and involuntary manslaughter ( bp ) . 
  this is willful violation of emissions standards , probably a violation of import regulations , fraud , malfeasance , false advertising . 
  basically this is a big fucking deal , vw broke the law , lied about breaking the law , and now has finally admitted to willfully and intentionally breaking the law . 
  that 's the joke . 
  hmm odd that the number varies so much up and down there is no voting . 
  maybe just reddit weirdness . 
  this post is really getting a lot of down votes , you are n't going to be able to bury this germany , you can stop now . 
   everything you 're saying makes perfectly good sense , but i think you 're underestimating just how dangerous iraq can be - i do n't know a lot about 80s new york , but i 'd wager today 's iraq is more dangerous than that . 
  you might be surprised , i certainly agree that iraq is overall a very dangerous place . 
  but conflict can be a very segmented thing , look at ukraine for example . 
  there 's a war going on but for many people in the western portions of the country the practical reality of the war just is n't there . 
  i do n't know how much you want to trust this index , but there are other sources that hint at similar conclusions . 
  http://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings.jsp but this basically shows baghdad as being less dangerous than bogota . 
  i 'm not saying iraq is n't having a ton of problems , and i 'm not planning to vacation in baghdad . 
  but baghdad is still a place where people live . 
  and it is n't as if 10 % of iraqis are dying violently . 
  there are cities in countries which are not dealing with insurgencies that are similarly dangerous to baghdad . 
  i would n't consider these places to be safe , but at the same time i would n't necessarily not go there . 
  if people are talking seriously about leaving finland to return to baghdad you can be reasonably sure they do n't think they 'll die as soon as they get off the plane . 
  and it might be nicer to be at home in baghdad with friends and family than being in finland on your own during the winter time ... 
  i 'm not trying to minimize the conflicts in the me . 
  i 'm just saying that much of the world including the united states is more dangerous than the scandinavian social democracies . 
  it 's something you get used to within limits , at the end of the day even in dangerous places you 're more likely to be killed by normal shit like a heart attack than an ied . 
  since the beginning of the iraq war some 224,000 iraqis including combatants have died ( iraq body count ) . 
  as a percentage of iraqs population that 's about one in every two hundred people . 
  which is a lot but that 's over the course of 12 years since the invasion . 
  and that 's the country as a whole , most of which is far far less secure than baghdad which has remained largely safe for years now . 
  violence like wealth is a relative thing , i 'm not saying the violence in baghdad is n't bad . 
  but it is probably comparable to for example some of the worst border cities during the height of the cartel wars . 
  these things happen and people chug along , security matters for some people less than others . 
  i 'd rather live in a relatively dangerous place and enjoy my life than a totally safe place and be bored and miserable . 
  one good thing to say about deepwater horizon is that it was at least an accident . 
  they were certainly cutting corners and not following all of the procedures they were mandated to . 
  but it was still and accident . 
  this is / was a blatant and intentional deception of the epa , and not some lie by emission ( heh heh ) . 
  they literally wrote a program to detect an inspection and then altered vehicle characteristics to beat the test . 
  then they intentionally defrauded tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of consumers . 
  and yeah , i 'm not going to lie it probably does n't help their case that this is an international corporation . 
  it starts to taste a little like economic espionage in the circumstances . 
  all of this equates to rolling heads and examples being made . 
  i think people do n't understand just how relative wealth is . 
  i 've lived in and visited very rich places , and i 've lived in and visited very poor places . 
  and in a sense there is less of a divide between rich and poor than people sometimes imagine . 
  just because a place is poor does n't necessarily mean a low quality of life . 
  prices are adjusted to what people can afford ( willing to pay ) this is how economies work . 
  so long as a place is reasonably safe , and organized enough so that basic infrastructure is available wealth matters less than people think . 
  for example new york where i live is quite a rich city , lots of job opportunities , tons of amenities / activities / etc are available . 
  so living in new york i can earn considerably more money than say living in budapest . 
  but it 's not all flowers and puppies , new york also has a higher crime rate than budapest . 
  and there 's a pretty severe housing shortage , so relative to income rent is quite a lot higher . 
  i have friends in budapest making about 800 euros p/month which seemed pretty average for that age / skill group . 
  which is less than half of what i make in nyc at my full time job ( i do other stuff on the side , no i do n't sell drugs ) . 
  who are able to rent large apartments in the city center ( with room mates ) and they 're paying about 200 / 250 eu p/month in rent . 
  which as a percentage of income is ** way ** less than what i would pay in new york , for a much shittier less centrally located room in a shared apartment . 
  in my experience the really big impact of relative wealth is how it impacts the way you can interact with the larger world . 
  buying international products is easier if you 're in a rich place , it 's much cheaper in relative terms for me to get an iphone than most people living in hungary . 
  it 's also much easier for me to travel because my wages / currency match up pretty favorably compared to many places . 
  but in terms of day to day life , the quality of life you have in a poor place is pretty comparable to a wealthy place . 
  while iphones are cool toys , the truth is they do n't really make you a happier person or make your life much better . 
  one of my friends who now lives in budapest was living in london for some time . 
  making a ton more money than in budapest , but he feels like the quality of his life is higher in budapest because he can actually go out and he can afford a nice apartment . 
  in absolute terms he 's considerably poorer than he was before but he 's much happier about his quality of life . 
  iraq to finland is something of a different story because presumably there 's a good deal more violence in iraq . 
  at the same time i 've heard baghdad is still a perfectly livable place . 
  if isis overruns the city that might change very quickly but for the most part you 'll be fine . 
  like nyc in the 80 's which was technically insanely dangerous / high crime . 
  but the vast majority of the millions of people living in the city were still never victims of a crime , and far fewer still were the victims of a violent crime . 
  ** tldr : ** wealth is relative , if you 've got a decent job in baghdad you might only be making a few euros a day but it might buy you a pretty good life in baghdad . 
  while flying to finland as a refugee ( or even a legal migrant ) might mean larger wages in absolute terms but not necessarily a better quality of life . 
  that 's very beautiful , but it really is n't a scottish bagpipe , even if it has a similar functional mechanism . 
  i did some research on the subject , thanks for the verification . 
  here 's how i tracked it down : http://lmgtfy.com/?q=that+song+everyone+plays+on+bagpipes, 
  sometimes i wonder if the man who invented the bag pipe invented it for this one song , and then never wrote another song , and no one has since then . 
  because whenever someone has a bagpipe i already know exactly what they 're going to play . 
  good song though . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xk9wh_hel8 this is all i know about finland ... also that i would rather not fight a war with them . 
  god damn how are people so fucking stupid ? 
  the chinese built these cities with funds from chinese savings accounts . 
  it 's not like there are n't people in china who need or want better homes . 
  the problem is ** they ca n't afford them ** . 
  i get it they 're empty , nobody is using them . 
  these are investments and these construction companies are able to keep these assets on their books right now as being at least as valuable as the initial investment . 
  even though they are n't able to sell them at a price high enough to recoup their costs .
