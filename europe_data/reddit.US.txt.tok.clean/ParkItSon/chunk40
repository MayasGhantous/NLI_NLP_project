  it took years before they worked out all the deals with content providers before they had much good stuff . 
  i imagine it 'll be pretty similar situation in other markets . 
  that sounds like a problem for the russian people . 
  so , once again not our concern let the russian government worry about its people , let the people worry about their government . 
  it is our job to worry about our people and our governments . 
  so when our people ( or the people of an allied nation ) are attacked by a foreign nation i expect a serious response . 
  let russia worry about russia . 
  that sounds like a problem for the russian government . 
  and all the eu citizens who got killed is a problem for the eu . 
  the current sanctions on russia are not enormous they can certainly be increased if the eu wants to . 
  will they be increased ? 
  no because the eu nations do n't really give a shit and they 'd rather not lose more sales . 
  they are n't expected to handle it , and no one cares so long as ** they ** ( as in someone who is n't greece ) are n't expected to handle it . 
   it is annoying that european politicians talk so much about but , never do anything about it . 
  why is that ? 
  because european politicians have no real obligations to `` europe '' these are still national leaders dependent on national support . 
  if a national leader can avoid a problem for their country at the expense of other countries they will . 
  the eu attempt to share the load is failing because without a situational obligation to bare some of the load it is much easier to take none of the responsibility . 
  the eu can huff and puff but not much more . 
  if you do n't think the b2 bomber is sexy and basically flight incarnate i do n't know what to tell you . 
  more displacement yes , nuclear powered yes . 
  more guns ? 
  no , fewer guns , smaller guns , shorter range guns . 
  the kirov is missile centric , indisputably . 
  the zummwalt is built with a heavy emphasis on guns . 
  guns that are actually useful in this day and age . 
  155mm that can be lobbed downrange roughly 3x 's the range of the biggest and baddest battleship guns . 
  the fire rate is pretty astounding as well . 
  there is also the very real possibility that the [ zummwalt will be kitted out with railguns ] ( http://nextbigfuture.com/2016/02/us-navy-considers-skipping-prototype.html ) . 
  it 's not a dreadnought , but it might very well turn out to be the modern re-imagining of the battleship . 
  by guns , closest thing to a battleship in the better part of a century . 
  well first off its fucking big , yeah it 's not as big as a full on battleship but by today 's standards for any non-carrier / force projection craft it 's huge . 
  more importantly though it 's a gun-centric ship , the first one in a long time . 
  it 's got the `` advanced gun system '' which allows it to put a lot of big shells a long ways downrange . 
  it is also very probable that the zummwalt is also going to be the first ship to carry full blown combat ready rail guns , and it is also probable that it will be the first ship to utilize directed energy weapons . 
  its got a lot of vertical launch cells as well but it 's the first ship in a very long time to rely heavily on its guns , and notably it has ** two ** , two big ones , more than just about any ship out there today . 
  so i do n't think it 's an unreasonable stretch to say that the zummwalt is the nearest thing to a battleship in a long time . 
  it is possible that the zummwalt in the not too distant future will be first ship to be able to defend itself from aircraft without air support of its own . 
  the big question is how hard is implementation of rail gun , and directed energy weapons going to be ? 
   anyone can be rehabilitated . 
  you might want to look in to psychopathy . 
   it just gives someone no reason to rehabilitate . 
  sorry you ca n't rehabilitate someone who stabs their pregnant girlfriend and then sets her on fire . 
  does canadian law not consider aggravating circumstances ? 
  in this case i believe three \\ commonly recognized `` aggravating circumstances '' would be triggered . 
  1 ) premeditation 2 ) murder of a pregnant woman 3 ) exceptional brutality or cruelty a cursory reading of canadian sentencing law suggests to me that they very well may have been sentenced more harshly than you 're saying . 
  part of canadian law seems to imply that these are the maximum sentences ** without ** aggravating factors , and it seems clear that several aggravating factors would apply here . 
  also the canadian period is the minimum period without opportunity for parole , it does n't say that they are guaranteed release after that period ends , just that they are will not have parole opportunity before that time . 
  i ca n't read german , but if he 's not going to be out for 60 years ( which sounds reasonable to me ) then why not just sentence him for 60 years . 
  rather then having some `` continuing danger to the public '' clause which allows you to indefinitely extend detention ? 
  everyone and their mom is devaluing their currency these days . 
  i think ship descriptions are getting increasingly wiggly these days . 
  people going around calling aircraft carriers `` helicopter destroyers '' . 
  america has the `` littoral combat ships '' which are basically frigates . 
  then we 've got the zummwalt class `` destroyer '' which is actually larger than a ticonderoga class cruiser , and is really more of a battleship . 
  it 's not often that i get jealous of other countries boats , but this one is kind of gorgeous . 
  seriously people say this as if getting involved in europe does n't draw cries of `` evil imperialist , yankees get out '' . 
  the only time the u.s. has been able to meaningfully influence european politics was when europe was * literally * shot to shit . 
  and you had massive land armies just waiting to conquer what was left on the continent . 
  europe cared about the american opinion then , but the u.s. can not have a major impact on the eu today . 
  the eu already does n't seem to know how to interact ** with itself ** , never mind an international environment where some nations like the united states while others want them out of their lives ( except in our capacity as an import market ) . 
  the eu needs to figure out what the fuck it wants for itself before you can start looking to outside partners for help on the issue . 
  you and the officers of every city hall in italy . 
  does n't mean we want to spend the money on you . 
  europe might be the center of your world but it is n't the center of ours . 
  we have another bigger ocean to live in , with more serious rivals , and allies that are under greater threat , ** and ** do n't have the gdp to necessarily provide for their own defense , even though they actually make an effort . 
  the eu is the single largest economic entity ** in , the , world , ** you should be providing more for your own defense . 
  in part so we can redirect our attentions elsewhere . 
  oh hey what 's up can i introduce to mein obermeier trump ? 
  i think tomatoes are something of a special case . 
  they 're actually pretty impossible to do on * any * sort of industrial scale . 
  just too fragile . 
  i 'm generally a huge skeptic of the european superiority complex but you 're unequivocally right about one thing . 
  food and mass production do , not , go , well , together . 
  or at least they do n't go well together if efficiency is your primary goal . 
  i think there 's a ton of market opportunities in the us for better food right now . 
  my girlfriend is portuguese that 's just how she described her experience with many people in her public school . 
  also there is a real lack of opportunity for people in parts of the country . 
  what i think is that i 've seen what happens to people who never leave their small towns . 
  how easy it is to get caught up in the importance of your little group of high school friends . 
  and how easy it is to lose perspective and to think that a tiny part of the world is the world . 
  i am well aware that their are positives to these places as well , my point is that tiny isolated places can be hard to escape . 
  you can get into trouble in cities as well but in cities you e got options , in a tiny town 100 miles from anywhere you 're limited for options . 
  well i 'm surprised you think there 's a lot to do before you have a drivers license . 
  no jobs , very few activities , lots of empty time to get into trouble , and lots of unmotivated company to spend time with ( great motivation ) . 
  i 've also lived in tiny towns and huge cities , and i would n't want to raise a high school student in a place where meth and glue sniffing is considered a valid form of escape . 
  according to 90 % of teenagers , have you ever lived in a twin with 14,000 people ? 
  i do n't mean this as an insult , but it sounds like you want to take your children on vacation to portugal . 
  but everything you 're discussing is outside of the realm of possibility for average portuguese citizens . 
  i 'm from a tiny town in new mexico , and it reminds me a lot of portugal . 
  great place to grow up as an actual young kid , but the schools are low grade , and as kids get older and get bored they turn to drugs , and start having sex and having kids at very young age . 
  so a lot of people get through high school with a fun little drug habit or a brand new toddler , or both . 
  and that 's when the real problems start ** there 's nothing to do ** . 
  very little in the way of opportunities for further education or work because new mexico is fundamentally a poor state . 
  portugal is awesome , beautiful country , wonderful food , wonderful people . 
  but you are n't thinking it through if you really think that 's where you want kids to grow up , at least if you want them to ** do ** anything . 
  i 'll always love new mexico , i might even go back to retire , but my parents undoubtedly made the right choice by leaving when i was about 10 . 
  rapid troop and materials deployment , utilizing high quality infrastructure and hyper competent organization , [ what 's that you say ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnv-szygm6o&amp;t=5m30s ), 
  a few reports of them falling out of ceilings , but it 's one of those stories that might be a little bit legend and a little bit fact .
