  it just highlights how weird the incentives get in a command economy . 
  the joke is that some soviet factories were given production incentives . 
  because these production incentives were sometimes awarded according to weight of product the incentives encouraged the creation of worryingly heavy chandeliers . 
  really ? 
  i always though the absence of subway was one of the better elements of communism . 
  also extremely heavy chandeliers , you would n't believe how hard it is to use a western chandelier as a boat anchor . 
  you give the most and you also benefit the most . 
  i live in nyc which means i pay a metric shit ton in both state and federal taxes . 
  and in return i get almost none of that tax money back because nyc is a huge net contributor to both the federal and state tax budget . 
  but the only reason we have that much money to pay taxes in the first place is because new york is basically the financial capital of the country and world and so we benefit enormously and thus pay back a proportional amount . 
  germany benefits from its position in the eu far more than it pays for those benefits . 
  the eu fund contributions are basically a dixie cup bailing out a sinking ship level of contribution . 
  all while you 're ransacking the ship for cargo . 
  i 'm not going to respond to your post in full and here 's why . 
  because you either do n't understand , or are intentionally choosing not to understand the point . 
  and here 's the telling example :  does the us do that with canada ? 
  you guys got a simiiar trade agreement do n't you ? 
  the united states and canada have a ** trade balance ** , in fact we run a slight deficit [ ( canad exports more than we import into canada ) ] ( https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c1220.html ) . 
  germany on the other hand runs a ** massive ** trade surplus with just about everyone but especially within the eu . 
  the end result of this is that germany is in essence sucking money / resources / and talent away from the rest of europe . 
  and this is a problem because the lack of a federalized system of wealth distribution means that this imbalance grows and compounds upon itself . 
  to the point now where germany has such a massive imbalance that any reduction in your customer base can put a halt to german economic growth and throw you into a recession . 
  i 'm not going to respond to the rest of your points because frankly they are like this one . 
  you 've chosen to deliberately misunderstand the situation in favor of an entitled sense of victimhood . 
  i am pro-eu , and i am even pro-germany , but for the eu to survive germany needs to be less wildly self centered and obsessed with german growth and stability and actually consider the economic and security concerns of its friends and neighbors . 
  if you want the eu to be and remain a meaningful edifice you must go beyond what is always best for germany . 
  ukraine is n't but estonia , latvia , and lithuania , poland and romania are . 
  all countries that feel threatened by russia for good reason . 
  because should russia decide to act they could overwhelm the baltic states within hours . 
  any forces stationed there would be insufficient to stop their advance . 
  and from that point forward nato would be on the back foot , in a position to decide between further escalation and concession . 
  and do n't fucking tell me `` that will never happen '' . 
  it has happened , it might happen again , is it likely , no . 
  but that does n't mean that germany should n't be required to make an actual effort to defend its neighbors and allies . 
  and it does n't mean that germany should behaving in a manner aimed at comforting russia for business reasons rather than establishing s credible defense along the nato border so that estonia , latvia , and lithuania in particular do not end up in a strategically untenable position . 
  what i mean by an open market is an open market for germany to export things to . 
   i believe we need the uk to make the eu stronger and better . 
  and to make something stronger and better sometimes it 's necessary to push hard and be critical . 
  you know that all makes sense to me . 
  what does n't makes sense to me is how can schulz and germany claim to be making an effort to make the eu stronger ? 
  it seems to me like germany does n't give a flying fuck about the eu beyond the elements of the eu that are ** important to germany ** . 
  mainly an open market , with a common currency , that germany is able to dominate . 
  does germany take the security concerns of anyone in the eu seriously ? 
  because to me it seems that they want to work with russia so long as it benefits them , even if that allows russia to apply greater political pressure to e. / central europe . 
  has germany volunteered to increase its military readiness . 
  to station troops on nato borders , to deter further russian aggression ? 
  has germany taken seriously the concerns of other eu nations regarding their ability to control their borders , or to sustain an influx of migrants and refugees ? 
  does germany want to regulate its massive trade imbalances to improve the inequality situation across the eu , rather than just strangling out competition to german companies ? 
  does germany have any intent of allowing their banks to take a hit , when those banks made bad loans to other eu nations ? 
  or would they prefer those nations to nationalize their debt , and to socialize the losses that resulted from the bad decisions of banks and burrowers ? 
  i agree that the uk should be a part of an effort to make a stronger eu . 
  but i do n't see any signs of this supposed effort across the eu today . 
  it would be one thing to remain part of an organization that has coherent goals but as far as i can tell many of the eu members do n't have any interest in the eu at large , and their interests extend no further than national interest . 
  if germany wants others to join it in a grand effort to build a better eu i 'm all for that . 
  but germany needs to actually make an effort to fulfill its commitments , something which they are n't currently doing . 
  and if they can not set aside some of their national interests i fail to understand the argument that the uk should set aside theirs . 
  that 's pretty metal . 
  fun fact `` this land is your land '' was originally something of a political protest ballad . 
  with some of the original lyrics including :  was a high wall there that tried to stop me a sign was painted said : private property , but on the back side it did n't say nothing -- [ this land was made for you and me . ], 
  and  one bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple by the relief office i saw my people -- as they stood hungry , i stood there wondering if [ this land was made for you and me . ],

  we wrote it , that 's all we wanted to do . 
   right after nato/northern alliance overpowered the taliban . 
  we did not over power the taliban , the taliban left kabul and essentially blended back into the rural populations . 
  holding afghanistan is about controlling the countryside , not controlling the cities . 
  the fact that the taliban high tailed it out of all the major population centers shortly after initiation of hostilities was a boon to politicians looking to claim a decisive victory post 9/11 . 
  but the strategic implications were far less significant than citizens were lead to believe . 
  we could have gotten out of afghanistan post haste and the taliban would have immediately regrouped and reconquered all lost territory . 
  this would have made a massive impact on our credibility in the region with such as the norther alliance , a group of people who already did n't trust us after our rapid exit from afghanistan post ussr withdrawal in the 80 's . 
  this is also notably ** exactly ** what osama bin laden hoped for and even expected . 
  he hoped to demonstrate to regional actors through the 9/11 attacks that the united states was unwilling to commit significant resources to the region . 
  his objective would have been achieved because regional players actually know what is going on , even if the media is playing up the `` we defeated the taliban '' message back home . 
  going in and getting out the next week was never an option . 
  the only scenario where that might have worked is if we had been able to quickly capture a kill osama bin laden , and we chose to portray our actions as running down a criminal rather than confronting a widespread hostile movement .

  judge ** s ** , plural , learn english frenchie . 
  jaasm is not certified to carry nuclear weapons . 
  sweden does not have nuclear weapons , is a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , and is not a member of nato so not eligible for strategic weapons sharing programs . 
  russia by contrast is a nuclear state with operational strategic weapon delivery systems . 
  i think we should acknowledge that there is no equality between the threat the nsf present to russia compared to the threat the russia represents to them . 
  i think you 're missing the point , this is n't an indictment of russia so much as an indictment of sweden and their level of readiness . 
  if russia can launch a simulated attack and sweden is basically unaware and un-able to respond that is worrying . 
   basicly you could call every single nato exercise within 800 km of russia with f-16 or any newer fighter a nuclear exercise since they can use nukes . 
  edit jassm-er is cruise missile with range over 900km . 
  and it should be able to carry nuclear warhead , thats why russia isnt really happy when people train with those near by . 
  just fyi the capabilities of jaasm and jassm-er are n't really anything new . 
  the [ agm-129 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agm-129_acm ) was ( retired from active service in 2012 ) a long range ( almost 4000km ) , low observability , air launched , nuclear tipped cruise missile . 
  jaasm is a very handy new piece of tech , but its added capabilities are n't anything new exactly . 
  yes , they have occurred . 
  they 've been so wildly decisive because believe it or not there is in fact a ** massive ** technological gap between the west and what is being fielded by say russia or the former ussr . 
  [ operation mole cricket ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_mole_cricket_19 ) is a decent example . 
  israel vs. syria , 90 american made aircraft vs. 100 ussr supplied aircraft . 
  final tallies were between 82 and 86 russian aircraft destroyed at a cost of two damaged f-15 's , and some destroyed drones .
