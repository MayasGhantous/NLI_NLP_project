  why was the victory so decisive ? 
  israel had better radar , better missiles , and superior electronic warfare capabilities ( better jamming , better decoys , and superior directed communications and information sharing abilities ) . 
  the specification gap between the israeli and the syrian fighters was ** the least ** significant factor . 
  israel 's total command of the electronic warfare spectrum , and vastly superior situational awareness meant that syria was totally unable to fight back in a meaningful manner , despite the fact that in a head to head dogfight they ** should ** have preformed at least marginally better than being utterly outclassed . 
  in a2a warfare ** today ** you win by knowing where your enemies are before they know where you are , you win by being able to defeat their weapons and their systems . 
  if you can do that the fact that they have a better airplane does n't matter ** at all ** . 
  yeah , because we figured out that speed was n't quite as important as maneuverability . 
  after that we pretty much decided that speed and maneuverability are n't as important as stealth and sensors . 
  modern combat aircraft are sensor platforms and missile boats , more than they are dog fighters . 
  now insert `` in vietnam , f-4 , no gun , top gun , etc '' . 
  yeah i get it , but look at modern a2a kills and tell me how many were achieved with guns ... 
  are you saying there 's no segregation of norms in french society ? 
  the way people behave in clubs is the same as the way they behave at the office or at the parent teacher conferences ? 
  is there some sort of french social media site where people post nude pictures of themselves because that 's a huge cultural prerogative ? 
  facebook is a social media company whose policy is no nudity . 
  youtube is in a similar boat , they 've chosen for business reasons not to make nudity and sexuality a major element of their business model . 
  of course reddit has / r/gonewild and all sorts of other sub-reddits which involve sexual exploration in the realm of social media . 
  in your eyes for the u.s. to meet a standard of `` being ok with nudity '' everyone , has to be ok with nudity , everywhere , without any segregation . 
  but even in france it 's not nearly that cut and dry , where nudity is acceptable some places but not all , and `` levels of nudity '' are distinguished between ( tops vs. bottoms , etc. ) . 
  edit : missing word, 
   americans are shocked by nudity we 're shocked about race statistics in france . 
  such is lyfe . 
  ahhhh a nipple , my poor american mind can not , does not , how do i compute ?!? 
  seriously dude your fall back is `` americans are worried about nudity '' ? 
  no , we are n't , there are certain specific elements of american society which are shielded from the terror that is boobs . 
  basically last century media institutions that fall under the envelope of `` public broadcasting agencies '' abc / nbc / cbs are regulated by the fcc and they are somewhat comically old fashioned about profanity and nudity . 
  but there are many other sources of content that are more or less totally unregulated . 
  hbo / showtime / netflix / amazon prime etc. 
  the reason that nobody makes a big fuss about the fact that the fcc is a bit old and stodgy is because we 've chosen to basically ignore the fcc which has very limited authority . 
  why complain about the fact that a few boring old networks ca n't do full frontal nudity , when you can just invent a brand new way to deliver content that does n't fall under fcc regulations . 
  also the elements of the media that the fcc directly controls are old and boring , definitely not on the cutting edge of the culture or of media . 
  so they 're just sort of left alone by young people who do n't really watch those content providers any more . 
   how can you publish such a poll , how dare you ask such questions . 
  and people on here give americans shit when we talk about our freezed peaches ( free speech ) . 
  this is the fucking problem people , everyone just wants to hide in their bubble they do n't even want you ** asking ** questions that might be inflammatory or reveal unsettling truth . 
  limits on freedom of speech always end up here , with an outraged community demanding that this group not be allowed to ask questions , to publish the results , etc. 
  when it is up to people to decide what is acceptable speech and what is n't the restrictions always spread as some people feel they too deserve special protection . 
  we 're teenagers , you would n't understand , gaaah it 's like sometimes i ca n't even believe you 're my dad , was i adopted ? 
  it 's not a-typical for new companies to take decades to turn a profit . 
  especially if those new ventures are extremely up front capital intensive like building brand new cars and rockets . 
  further i 'm not claiming that these companies wo n't go bankrupt , if 2 out of 3 crash and burn that 's not a bad record honestly . 
  most new business ventures ** fail ** and that 's ok . failure is just an element of eventual success , and a big part of the reason that the us leads europe when it comes to startups is that we 've never made such a big deal about `` stability and longevity '' that europe is obsessed with in regards to business ventures . 
  and finally you have no idea if space x is profitable or not , as a private company they are n't obligated to release their financials . 
  what is clear to outside observers is that they 've secured contracts with nasa for both commercial resupply and commercial crew , they 've secured contracts with usaf for gps 3 launches , the have secured launches with the top five major satellite operators , and are launching almost all of the next generation irridium sats , not to mention a host of other smaller operators . 
  further they 've also just received a development contract from the usaf for the development of higher performance second stage engine . 
  none of the things listed above are indicative of a pipe dream company that is living on spending and nothing else . 
  musk 's companies are hugely risky and there 's a good chance he will fail , and there is also a significant chance that he will not . 
  oh this old bullshit meme . 
  space x has contracts with ** all five ** of the world 's largest satellite operators . 
  it has gone from a nothing to one of the top space launch companies in the world in under 15 years . 
  space x is not a government funding program away from not existing , shut up with this stupid uninformed bullshit . 
  and in this response we see the total brilliance of parker and stone . 
  in their understanding that people would literally prefer to get gay and fuck each other in the ass than trying to make the world better . 
  it 's actually more or less the most realistic answer there is . 
  you can not expect people to not do whatever is in their own best interest and if that means illegally crossing borders people will do it . 
  you can not actually defend borders , the mexican american border is more than 2000 miles long and there are 300k legal crossings a year and rising . 
  the border is totally indefensible . 
  if we want to control immigration across our southern border ** the only ** way to do that is by working with mexico to improve rule of law , and social and economic opportunities in mexico . 
  being angry and building a wall will do nothing . 
  http://southpark.cc.com/clips/154541/gay-for-america the end point of the episode is basically that its ridiculous to be angry at migrants for wanting to make a better life for themselves and their family . 
  and that it is also not un-reasonable to want to preserve your own quality and way of life . 
  so if we actually want to solve migrant / immigration problems the only real solution is to work to improve things for everyone so that people wo n't feel the need to leave their homes and `` took er joobbss '' . 
  but this being south park they do n't like to get too far away from the nasty , selfish , bullshit , which is the actual reality of human nature . 
  so just as they 're hitting you with this heart warming message about improving the world they point out that it 's pretty fucking gay and that people would probably rather be fucking each other in the ass than helping their neighbors ( in our case mexico ) . 
   how you have to fuck the future to save the present . 
  what ? 
  no the episode was about how making things better today would improve the future and thus prevent future migrants from ever needing to come to the past . 
  they start improving the world and the future migrants start to disappear . 
  then they decide that planting trees , cleaning up trash and volunteering at soup kitchens is actually really really gay . 
  so all the men and boys go back to fucking each other in the ass so that there will be no future , because this is somewhat less gay than planting trees .

  airplanes crash at a far lower rate than cars , but airplane crash investigations are far more rigorous than car accident analysis . 
  in a free country people can do stupid things that are bad for them and eventually cause them to die . 
  and there is n't honestly much the government can do about it other than trying to control people 's lives ( not popular here ) . 
  but the government actually can protect the country from external attack with some degree of efficacy . 
  it seems like europe has a pretty huge rate of passport counter fitting , why not jus deal with that problem instead of making excuses about why we should n't care ? 
  awww cute lets play the stereotype game durka durka baguettes and white table clothes in case i need to surrender during lunch . 
  i can buy legal coke in germany ? 
  honestly not sure that i care . 
  did n't one of the paris attackers have almost a dozen fake passports ? 
  and apparently greece thinks as many as 5-7 % of the passports in the country were forged . 
  it 's kind of a get your shit together situation and do n't make your inability to deal with it our problem . 
  i live in harlem , guy got shot literally in front of my building a few months ago . 
  drug and gang related , still not really worried about gun violence . 
  because the truth is that unless you 're involved , you are n't involved . 
  gangs and dealers do n't start shit with random people for no reason , it 's territorial , it 's personal , they do n't shoot you just because . 
  shooting at or fucking with un-involved people is just a good way to attract the attention of the police . 
   the question here is if saving the cost of fuel tank production ( an easy to produce component ) justifies the cost of bringing it back . 
  massive over simplification , a rocket is not a cheap fuel tank on top of some expensive engines . 
  there are sensors , pressure regulators , temperature regulators , a lot of complex plumbing , etc. 
  building a system where the engines can just be `` plugged in '' to an existing rocket is a pretty complex piece of engineering itself . 
  most complex machinery is not a simple modular design that can be re-arranged like legos . 
  real life is not like kerbal space program . 
   the question here is if saving the cost of fuel tank production ( an easy to produce component ) justifies the cost of bringing it back . 
  and what about the cost of designing an engine that is also a glider which can coast through several trans sonic barriers and can withstand at least some re-entry stresses ? 
  the cost of manufacturing the new rocket and then of course the cost of integrating your re-used engines onto that rocket ? 
  the space x solution is pretty much the most simple and elegant solution to the problem . 
  it has the not insignificant drawback of requiring a meaningful percentage of mass be allocated to returning the booster . 
  but the total mass to orbit problem is pretty handily defeated by just being able to do more , smaller launches .
