  or of course using multiple boosters that can all be re-used . 
  at the end of the day the space x solution is the most simple and the most elegant . 
  does that mean it 's the best ? 
  not necessarily but it also is n't a bad sign that it very well might be . 
  occam 's razor is still widely regarded as a sound though process for a reason . 
  landing just the engines is better than landing an almost complete rocket that is more or less ready to be refueled and fired again ? 
  that 's interesting , though i guess it makes sense after all we do only re-use aircraft engines and we scrap the fuselage because that 's a better solution than using the whole airplane . 
  yeah that 's pretty much 100 % bullshit it is very economically interesting the potential to ** not ** throw away a 40 to 50 million dollar piece of hardware is significant . 
  it has n't been done before because it is hard to do . 
   the technology is known since the 60 's . 
  there are lots of technologies that have been `` known '' for a very long time . 
  we 've `` known '' that yes you could build a rocket that could be landed vertically . 
  but there is an enormous gap between knowing and actually doing . 
  and up until recently it was the actually doing part that had not been achieved outside of some fairly minor nasa test programs . 
  make no mistake the space x landing last month was a historic achievement that was made possible through major investment and excellent engineering . 
  just because space x did n't invent some sort of groundbreaking technology ( like for example the sabre engine heat exchange system ) does not make what they did any less difficult . 
  concepts like stealth technology have been around for more than half a century , and the field was basically invented by the russian pyotr yakovlevich ufimtsev . 
  but you 'll note that russia does n't have any operational stealth aircraft . 
  the technology has been around for more than half of a century but ** the engineering ** to actually implement the technology is a massive hurdle . 
  same with space x , what they 've done has been known to be technically possible for a long time . 
  what they have done is bridge the gap between technical possibility and practical reality , and that is hard , very hard . 
   it cost a lot of money to check , clean , refit , relaunch a rocket and this is based on what ? 
  man kinds vast experience re-using rockets ? 
  there has basically been one even partially reusable launch system ever . 
  the shuttle main engines and the shuttle srb 's . 
  the srb 's were parachute dropped ( not a particularly soft landing ) , into ** the ocean ** before they were cleaned , refurbished and re-fueled . 
  the rs-25 main engines on the shuttle itself also required major refurbishment . 
  but the rs-25 and the merlin are not particularly similar engines . 
  the rs-25 first and most critically ** uses hydrogen ** which is corrosive and causes the metal to become brittle . 
  rp-1 rocket fuel is by contrast pretty mild stuff that does n't have a major negative impact on material integrity . 
  the space shuttle also went through a considerably more punishing regime than a space x first stage booster which does n't spend a prolonged period in space ( with components uncleaned and in contact with corrosive materials ) or have the same re-entry profile as the shuttle . 
  also the merlin d is far more simple than the rs-25 in part because durability and respectability is a major concern for space x. 
  while most rockets ever built previously are designed to maximize performance above all else . 
  and just fyi space x ** has already ** re-fired their landed first stage booster without refurbishment and it did n't explode . 
  drugs which are totally legal in most european countries right ? 
  i 've never owned a self defense weapon in my life . 
  i still find it deeply disturbing that you consider it reasonable to legally remove the right for people to own or carry any weapons . 
  it 's so enormously nanny stateish . 
  it 's not about refugees , it 's just about the total disarmament of civilians . 
  i can understand making a societal choice to ban guns , guns are insanely effective killing machines , but banning basically all self defense tools ( including non-lethal options ) is just fucking insane . 
  correlation does not equal causation . 
  the united states and the uk have different geography , different history , different culture , different ethnic makeup and the integration of those ethnic groups is different , different economic models and different levels of wealth inequality . 
  to say `` ah well the united states has legal pepper spray and their incidences of rape are higher than our own , thus pepper spray does n't not and can not prevent rape '' . 
  is fucking stupid , and it fails to recognize that the united states and the uk are different places . 
  to suggest that pepper spray should be illegal on the basis that it is legal in the us and we have higher incidences of rape . 
  is just as stupid as suggesting that sunscreen does n't prevent sun burn , because there is a greater market for sunscreen in the us but we still have a higher rate of sun burns . 
  thus indicating that sunscreen does not prevent sun burn . 
  you 're using a very general statistic to justify specific policy decisions . 
   are you saying you just naturally have a higher amount of rapists in the usa ? 
  and you want us to emulate such a culture ? 
  do you think the right to buy and own pepper spray is what causes the higher incidences of rape ? 
  the united states ( depending on the state ) gets far more sun than the uk . 
  even without access to sunscreen odds are that people living in the uk will suffer a far lower rate of sun burns . 
  while in the u.s. even with access to sunscreen there are places with far more and far more intense sun . 
  so we get more sun burns , because people forget to wear sunscreen , because people forget to re-apply , etc. 
  this is not evidence that sunscreen does n't work and is thus un-needed . 
  rather it is just a result of the fact that the uk and the united states are ** different places ** . 
  finally that is n't really the point of my outrage at all . 
  the point is n't that the uk has a lower levels of rape , the point is that it 's ridiculous for your government to babysit everyone because some people are morons . 
  if sunscreen was illegal in the uk and legal in the states we would probably still have a far higher rate of sunburns . 
  catch my meaning ? 
   yeah , we do . 
  it 's fucking rad . 
  right up until you 're being raped and ca n't defend yourself because giving citizens access to any sort of weapon might harm `` society '' . 
  slightly less rad . 
  why does n't europe just ban all sharp objects and require all citizens to only used plastic safety knives ? 
  everything that needs to be cut can be shipped pre-sliced from a carefully controlled government `` slicing facility '' . 
  after all knives are too dangerous for normal citizens to be trusted with . 
  right , she 's being fined for attempting to secure the right to defend herself . 
  self defense means taking reasonable measures to defend yourself , the fact that you are not allowed to take those measures means you are n't allowed to defend yourself . 
  not in europe . 
  after all , government knows best , they know if and when we should be allowed to protect ourselves , they probably have a degree in it . 
   just a hint : `` civilians '' wont ever win an arms race against criminals . 
  ahh so civilians do n't have the right to defend themselves because there is a chance that criminals will be better armed ? 
  seriously is your entire continent fucking nuts ? 
  police are there to ** protect society ** they are not there to protect you personally . 
  if shit is going down odds are the police are not going to be there to stop the robbery / rape / murder in time . 
  the police will probably catch the person afterwards thus preserving societal security . 
  but they will not save you . 
  it 's pretty typical of europe , you guys care more about social welfare than individual rights . 
  put in your bets now . 
  if the deal is canceled i 'm betting that they buy the agusta westland aw101 . 
  similar price and capabilities to the ec725 . 
  the major advantage is that the aw101 is operated by a significant number of nato members . 
  which bodes well for the long term operating cost and upgrade opportunities for the aw101 . 
  ec725 has seen limited adoption ( particularly in the west ) , sikorksy s-92 has somewhat limited military adoption ( also same as the ec725 ) . 
  sikorsky ch-148 is only operated by canada , has received some criticism , and is a maritime helicopter . 
  aw101 is my bet , assuming that the deal falls apart . 
  haha , nope , my dad told me to finish school get a job and pay for my own god damned vacation . 
  which i did , not really complaining my parents paid for my school in full . 
  i think studying abroad is fun , but i think the true `` value '' is massively exaggerated . 
  i remember when i told my dad i wanted to do a semester abroad . 
  i believe the exact response was `` oh so you want to go on vacation for six months ? '' . 
  he was n't wrong ... 
  wait i 'm still confused are we talking about cumulonimbus clouds here or is this more about stratus clouds ? 
  what is the european opinion on accepting cirrus clouds ? 
  bitches be throwing shade . 
  steve ? 
  the point is that finland is never going to have significant power projection capabilities . 
  and honestly we can not expect them to .
