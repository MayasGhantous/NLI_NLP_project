  but it 's ludicrous to imagine that finland a nation with the population and economy of wisconsin will somehow be capable of major power projection . 
  if they can provide some air support , a few thousand highly trained soldiers , and they have a few hundred thousand conscripts to defend the homeland i would say that 's a very reasonable contribution for a nation like finland . 
  but finland even spending 4 % of its gdp is not going to have its own strategic air command . 
  edit : i will say that this fact demonstrates why europe does need to get its shit together in regards coordinating their military expenditures and roles across the continent . 
  tens of nations all trying to develop independent capabilities is insanely expensive and inefficient . 
   but i just can not see a realistic scenario wherein russia attacks an eu country . 
  go back and ask people in 1913 if they expect that by 1945 the austro hungarian empire will be gone , the ottoman empire will be gone , the new german empire will be gone and the germans will be effectively disarmed . 
  ask them if they expected if the british and french empires would be collapsing , and ask them if they would be surprised that the mighty british fleet would have been totally eclipsed by that of the americans . 
  ask them if they expect 100 million europeans to be dead through violence or the products of violence in the next 30 years . 
  i doubt you could find a single person in 1913 who would believe how much the world was about to change . 
  nobody looks for alliances when they expect easy sailing . 
  which is precisely why nato has avoided the addition of embattled states . 
  nato is an insurance policy against ** the unexpected ** . 
  you do n't get health insurance after your ski accident , you get it before you go on the trip . 
  so do i expect russia to invade finland , or estonia , or poland ? 
  but the point of nato , the point in having a capable military , is to be prepared for what you do n't expect . 
  because history has shown us that our expectations are often wrong , very wrong . 
  well if finland were a part of nato defending yourself is still part of defending nato . 
  every nato member has defensive systems and expenditure that are oriented towards defending the homeland not towards defense of nato . 
  the thing about mutual defense is that its best if we never have to do it . 
  individual strength still aids overall nato security because countries with robust self defense are not easy targets of attack . 
  and not being an easy target discourages those who might want to `` test '' the resilience of the alliance . 
  i do n't ** want ** to pay my friend back when he buys me lunch . 
  but i do , because we are friends , and it is shitty to exploit others for their generosity . 
  could i get away with it ? 
  yeah probably , say ten bucks , we 're both adults . 
  he probably is n't ever going to bring it up , but maybe it happens again , and again , and the balance of goodwill in our relationship falls apart . 
  that is the situation with many of the current nato members in europe . 
  they are n't meeting their contributions because after all they have small economies , the americans have a great big military budget , and they are n't going to kick us out , makes sense to freeload . 
  but here 's the thing , we all know what is going on , and over time it eats at people little by little . 
  if you make an agreement , live up to that agreement , do n't half ass it because you can get away with it . 
  similar to india , want to get ** anything ** done by government employees ? 
  well you 're going to have to bribe them and nag them incessantly or that shit ai n't getting done . 
   cooperation among oil producers will take time , says saudi minister translation  `` the last time we tried to cooperate we cut production and you fuckers kept on pumping at full rate , fuck you , die in a fire '' . 
  people who are optimistic that we 're at peak oil should realize that we only ** just ** hit peak coal utilization , and now that seems to legitimately be in decline . 
  the demand for gas and gasoline has not come close to peaking yet . 
  why is it that you think hyfrac operations are publishing that information ? 
  they are n't , this stuff is proprietary and the drillers are mostly not interested in telling the world how well or how poorly they are doing . 
  the evidence that some people are still making money is that some operators are still working . 
  and it seems improbable that they would be doing that if they were losing money . 
   additionally costs were significantly inflated during the boom times when cutting costs did n't matter that much as profiting was easy with the then high oil prices . 
  there is significant elasticity in the operating costs - both in fixed costs and variable costs ( break-even price vs shut-in price ) . 
  excellent point , when the price of oil was through the roof producers were n't focused on cutting costs . 
  the major investments were in being fast and acquiring new equipment and claims . 
  now the incentives have changed , to make money or at least to give them the breathing room to wait out the slump they 'll be focusing far more on cost cutting and efficiency . 
  in the log term this more challenging environment will probably make the industry stronger . 
  as prices eventually rebound a whole new set of knowledge discovered during the slump will be incorporated into industrial practices . 
  the same does n't necessarily apply to russia or the gulf oil states which utilize far older more basic and better understood techniques to access their oil . 
  while i 'm sure they 're all trying to cut operating costs as well these fields are much further along the learning curve where innovation is much slower and less efficient . 
  while hydraulic fracturing is a much newer technique which generally means a steeper learning curve , and more rapid and significant improvements to efficiency and cost . 
  you do n't know the real break even point , nobody but the individual operators know their break even point . 
  fracking technique is being developed and improved on by hundreds / thousands of independent players . 
  they ** are not telling you anyone ** how much it costs or what their exact production techniques are . 
  what is clear is that they have hugely reduced their operating costs . 
  it is very possible that some operations are still making money even at sun $ 30.00 . 
  but even if every single fracking operation goes bankrupt the equipment and knowledge base already exists . 
  once prices begin to recover new investors will buy that equipment at bargain prices and start work again . 
  the oil prices are going to recover very gradually . 
  and fyi i am currently buying oilers so i do n't believe the world is ending . 
  but the oil price is not going to just bounce back , it 's going to probably go lower and then it will gradually recover . 
  but not nearly fast enough to rescue russia from its current budget woes . 
   indeed and others have n't the only reason the imf is in your country is if you 've fucked very badly up and you 're out looking for last resort help because there is no other way to get a loan . 
  the imf shows up when things are already bad , and they try to offer aid . 
  but that does n't mean they succeed every time , and failure is n't always their fault . 
  ultimately a government and its people need to find a solution . 
  if you are n't trying to help yourself no outside force can save you . 
  ... i mean what do you want me to say to that ? 
  iceland and america both have a navy but the word does n't really even mean the same thing . 
  most countries have an air force , which means they have some people trained to fly a few aircraft with military roles . 
  the usaf by contrast is an organization responsible for both flying planes and operating space craft , and developing next generation weapons and other tech . 
  just because they both fall under the label `` air force '' does n't really make them the same sort of thing . 
  most countries air forces are more like our air national guard . 
  on top of nasa we 've got the air force , they pay a lot of monies for new space toys . 
   ** ariane 5 rockets are manufactured under the authority of the european space agency ( esa ) ** and the centre national d'etudes spatiales . 
  airbus defence and space is the prime contractor for the vehicles , leading a consortium of sub-contractors . 
  ariane 5 is operated and marketed by arianespace as part of the ariane programme . 
  astrium builds the rockets in europe and arianespace launches them from the guiana space centre in french guiana . 
  arianespace is the commercial front of the operation but they have extremely close ties with ela and airbus . 
  one of those ties is the fact that ela has no small part of the responsibility for paying for ariane development programs . 
  [ here 's and example ] ( http://spacenews.com/esa-industry-at-odds-over-ariane-6-funding-responsibilities/ ) . 
  further ela is a european agency which has an vested interest in supporting european industry . 
  just like nasa as an american agency has a vested industry in supporting the development of american industry . 
  that is for example a part of why nasa yesterday announced that they had awarded contracts to all three competitors for the commercial resupply 2 missions ( space x , orbital atk , and sierra nevada corporation ) . 
  one part of the contract is about completing missions , another part of the contract is about providing incentives to companies to develop new technologies and capabilities . 
  aside from contracts i think all of these companies have been awarded development funding by nasa , and just yesterday the usaf announced a 30 million dollar award of development funding to assist space x in the development of a raptor second stage engine . 
  so pardon me for saying that the line between `` private industry '' and `` public agency '' can get a little blurry when it comes to space launch . 
  why ? 
  if everyone is cooperating where is the incentive to reduce price and increase efficiency ? 
  space x is pushing ariane , ula , and just about everyone else to make evolutionary changes in their products right now . 
  if everyone is cooperating and there is no possibility of losing than everything improves very slowly and incrementally . 
  space x has just given everyone in the industry a very good reason to be afraid for the future survival of their companies . 
  and that is much stronger incentive to innovate than everyone being nice to each other all the time . 
  if ula / ariane / proton do n't make some big improvements in the next few years it 's probable that they wo n't be around in the next few decades . 
  but the cost of getting into space will be far lower than it has ever been . 
   the big increase in spending on rockets -- up 72 percent , to 1.05 billion euros in 2016 feeling a bit of pressure after the recent space x landing , and after the announcement yesterday that space x landed its [ first contract with eutelsat yesterday ] ( http://spacenews.com/with-eutelsat-win-spacex-has-business-with-all-5-top-satellite-fleet-owners/ ) if i had to guess . 
  the more competition the better . 
  `` this man is bleeding to death , someone help '' `` ok well i 'm a doctor i 'll try my best '' `` oh god too late he 's already dead , what have you done doctor ? 
  this is all your fault ! '', 
  nah he lives in phildelphia , cool apartment third reich made some high quality good looking propaganda . 
  i mean i would n't hang it on my wall , but i 'm not a nazi .
