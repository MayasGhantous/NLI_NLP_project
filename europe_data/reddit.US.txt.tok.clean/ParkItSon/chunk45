   hitler himself was most likely gay i mean hitler was a scrawny little brunette who thought the pinnacle of human perfection was giant blonde aryans . 
  hitler was a weird dude . 
   where it was more gradual and planned the countries have been far more stable and successful . 
  because when a draw down is gradual / planned there is time for institutional development to occur . 
  at the end of the day this all comes down to the question of `` who is in charge ? '' . 
  in an restrictive authoritarian state the answer to the question is `` the dictator , the dictator is in charge of everything and whatever he does is law '' . 
  the dictator is the keystone and without him the entire structure collapses . 
  compare that to a society with multiple facets of authority . 
  in such a situation when you ask `` who is in charge of x '' you 'll be pointed in a direction , and if you ask `` who is in charge of y '' you 'll be pointed in another . 
  if for some reason x disappears it 's a problem , but at least y has some clue about how things are supposed to get done . 
  there 's a middle ground between dictator and free democratic society . 
  [ lee kuan yew ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lee_kuan_yew ) is a pretty good example of someone who walked the line between deputy and despot . 
  but crucially because yew was n't an extreme authoritarian other institutions were able to grow in singapore which balanced his power . 
  when he ultimately left office he was n't leaving a vacuum but a developed networks of authorities and powers which balanced against each other . 
  but if you transition from an absolutist authoritarian government , to something brand new it 's very very hard . 
  because for a government to be effective it must be viewed as credible , and at least somewhat trustworthy . 
  but credibility , and trust take time to develop , the process does not accelerate easily . 
  what you end up with is a lot of different people claiming to be authorities , or the authority , and there is no structure for those people to work together and not trust within the citizenry . 
  if someone tells you they 're the police do you just believe them ? 
  if `` the government '' is trying to build a road and they want to contract with you , do you believe they 'll pay you , do you believe the project is legitimate and you wo n't be murdered by farmers who do n't want that road because the farmers are n't afraid of the government ? 
  in such a situation the rational decision is pretty obvious , you withdraw from the amorphous concepts of `` society '' and `` law '' and you return to something more basic `` family '' and `` force '' . 
  the only people you care about are the people who care about and will work with you and help you . 
  the only law that matters is the law of survival and the law of force , this is mine unless you can take it from me . 
  to get from that point back to a modern nation state you need to build a new framework of trust so that people feel safe working with each other again . 
  but that is difficult because it involves people surrendering their own security to someone else , and that someone is maybe from a tribe or group with a bad history with yours . 
  you do n't have to hate the other side in such a situation , you just need to not trust the other side ( or sides ) enough to entrust them with your security and the security of your family . 
  i 've met a gay nazi , it 's not exactly the same but i do n't recall hitler being that cool with the gays . 
  well i never . 
  he perceived your post as arguing that ch is justified in being racist considering the fact that they were recently attacked by islamic extremists . 
  what you 're failing to understand is charlie hebdo ** is n't racist ** , they are attacking racism . 
  let me say this again , ch is n't racist they are making fun of the attitudes in europe by pointing out how people oscillate between sympathy for ** drowning children ** , to characterization of an entire group of individuals as rapists which has appeared in the last few weeks . 
  sarcasm and satire does n't translate all that easily across language and culture . 
  also the ultra left wing these days prefers to be offended rather than considering the message for a moment , so easy to misunderstand . 
  not that difficult to stay submerged ( if you 're a seal ) always pockets of air and little cracks in the ice to catch a breath . 
  but finding a hole large enough to get into the water , ( if you 're a seal ) with no chain saw , not so easy . 
  in russia safari , something something , you . 
  there are [ legitimate reasons ] ( http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/ ) to for the practice of male circumcision , like a 60 % reduction in hiv transmission rates . 
  if you 're born in swaziland , where hiv infection rate is greater than one in four , and where access to healthcare is often severely limited . 
  in such a situation as the parent of a child with access at this point to medical care , and the ability to significantly reduce my child 's future probability of contracting an incurable and often deadly disease , i would say male circumcision is the right move . 
  that being said , the united states and north america are not swaziland . 
  there is far greater access to medical care throughout the course of your life and if you want to be circumcised as an adult that option is available . 
  also you have cheap and easy access to less impermanent forms of protection so genital mutilation is far less necessary . 
  snipping babies dicks in the united states is an un-necessary practice that should be made illegal . 
  groping women is also not ok , and it is n't even remotely considered ok in egypt or india or bangladesh fyi . 
  women are told that such a thing happening to you is wrong / shameful / should n't be talked about . 
  it is n't as if these societies are bastions of polyamory , free sexual expression , love , whatever . 
  these societies disdain sexual activity and expression . 
  it just so happens that this is a bit of a hard sell for the human physiology , so in the absence of a healthy outlet for sexual frustration rape and sexual violence are common . 
  and because women are second class citizens , and because sex is not something you talk about , the women are just supposed to grin and bare it because bringing attention to what has been done to them will just result in social expulsion , unless of course they are criminally charged for sex outside of wedlock ... 
  i do n't find it all that surprising , and for what it 's worth its an issue that goes beyond islam . 
  but in much of the world this is just ** normal ** it is just what happens . 
  i 'm good friends with a bangladeshi women who flat out will not go back to bangladesh , not even on holidays . 
  she moved to the states when she was about 10 years old and she 's told me that she feels like did n't even really `` exist '' before she came here . 
  that before that she just was n't treated as someone who mattered , at all , and so she barely thought of her self as an individual with self worth at all . 
  and then of course on top of the above she 's also told me some pretty fucked up creepy shit about being groped by strangers when she was a child and no one giving a shit . 
  this sort of behavior and thinking is the norm across a significant percentage of the world population . 
  women are n't people , and so what you do to them does n't matter , also there 's a perception that westerners and thus western women are always having sex so that behavior is even more okay in the west than back home . 
  mein kampf re-released and is instant best seller , vigilante groups roaming the streets in search of ethnic minorities who are responsible for all their problems . 
  [ all i can say . 
   because they can literally steamroll across europe with thousands of tanks and shoot down all us/european air assets with their s-300s / s-400s . 
  people seriously over estimate just how effective these systems would be . 
  yes the s-300 and s-400 are very effective s2a weapons . 
  but believe it or not the us and the west has n't spent the last two and a half decades twiddling their thumbs on the issue . 
  have you ever heard of [ mald ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/adm-160_mald ) inexpensive , long range high endurance decoy cruise missiles which mimic the radar signature of military aircraft ? 
  believe it or not the s-300 and 400 have plenty of weaknesses , one of which being that they are expensive . 
  burn many missiles shooting down $ 30,000 ( or even the $ 300,000 dollar variant ) and you 're losing . 
  the s-300 and 400 missiles more or less all cost more than the decoys the high end longer range missiles cost as much as a million dollars more . 
  and as soon as s2a systems start shooting they can be detected and targeted by real aircraft . 
  area denial with surface to air weapons is nothing new , it has long been the cornerstone of soviet / russian air defense . 
  and so the united states and the west have countered to great effect . 
  for an object lesson on the subject consider [ operation mole cricket ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_mole_cricket_19 ) . 
  where the israeli air force destroyed more than 80 syrian ( ussr ) aircraft and 30 syrian ( ussr ) sam sites for a loss of two damaged f-15 's . 
  yeah , lots new ultra cheap destinations which are perceived as being dangerous or unstable with crashing currencies . 
  that 's where i like to vacation , onward to ukraine !, 
   we provided more monetary assistance than the us during the indian ocean tsunami did you ? 
  the us government contributed 950 million dollars to the relief effort the us people voluntarily contributed well over a billion more total contributions were nearly 3 billion dollars . 
  and we provided far more hard asset assistance than europe did ( because you know we have those assets and we pay to both buy / maintain / and train the crews so that equipment will be used . 
  europe provides far less in this regard , even though you have a combined economy larger than the united states . 
  so why did n't europe send three aircraft carriers and a 1000 bed hospital ship to indonesia ? 
  also we do n't need to be playing the `` who gives more '' game , that is n't the point of giving . 
  but maybe before you start playing the `` we 're more righteous '' card you should do better accounting ? 
  we should totally wear ghost costumes to scare the migrants away , everyone knows migrants are scared of ghosts . 
  how many aircraft carriers did the eu send to se asia after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami ? 
  perhaps a significant chunk of global us aid can not be expressed in direct dollar donations ? 
  hate to break it to you but the `` evil empire '' actually passed major reforms in the 70 's aimed at curbing the practice of corruption exportation . 
  the [ foreign corrupt practices act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_corrupt_practices_act ) made the bribery of foreign officials illegal . 
  there was an assumption at the time that other developed western nations would follow that lead and stop exporting corrupt practices to third world . 
  instead much of the rest of the world saw it as an opportunity to get one over on uncle sam and they actually increased expenditures on foreign bribery to win contracts . 
  it was n't really until the us justice department started taking legal action against foreign companies engaging in these practices who also operated within the united states that the rest of the western world started to play ball . 
  so before you play the `` everybody does it card '' no , not everybody does it and at least some governments pursue action against those who are doing it . 
  because maybe it 's a shitty practice to fuck up the rest of the world by exporting shit behavior and then acting ** shocked ** when those parts of the world do n't have functional governance .

  wow if he had so much support why did n't he just have free and fair democratic elections ? 
  how come there was a rebel volunteer army of 200,000 opposing the regime and how come 17k of his own soldiers stood against him ? 
  fyi this is my last response to you , not going to waste any more words on arguing with this level of petty ignorance . 
  you remember wrong than because there was widespread opposition to the regime and calls for outside help by the national transitional council .
