  a body which was widely recognized by the international community as the legitimate government of libya . 
  no you 're failing to understand that just because you 're figuring shit out for yourself does n't disallow the seeking of foreign aid . 
  you 're also being a prick who is trying to argue semantics in order to win an argument , which is you know , pathetic ? 
  did americans fight the revolution with or without outside aid ? 
  `` get your damned pants on we 're about to bomb blahbidy bleebeedy blahblahblah ! '',

  it might not be , last time i checked there 's no austro hungarian empire anymore either . 
  maybe libya should n't exist maybe it 's past time we talk seriously about redrawing some of the lines in the me . 
  but just saying `` ahhh it all worked with dictators , is both taking the most convenient and simplistic answer as the best , and morally bankrupt . 
  if the only way to keep a state together is by holding a gun to everyone 's head , maybe that state should n't exist ? 
  america is worse , because america is worse , any questions ? 
  i 'm not claiming my government is perfect , or that it adheres to my personal ideals . 
  i 'm not even saying that it is always wrong to support / prop up a dictator . 
  the world is messy , in a standoff between two nuclear powers a bad radar signature away from global annihilation there are a lot of a-moral decisions i would be willing to make . 
  i believe in making moral decisions so much as that is possible , and i believe in making immoral compromises so much as that is necessary . 
  sticking to your ideals while the world burns around your ears is n't necessarily moral . 
  at the same time a willingness to sacrifice anything and everything for the sake of security and stability is every bit as bad . 
  the libyan people have the right to want more from life , and if step one is dropping a noose around the neck of the bastard who has been oppressing them for decades i 'm not necessarily going to argue . 
  and if we want to help by putting a few bombs on government vehicles , well i guess that 's up to us . 
  but any american who wants to claim that no foreign government should get involved in a domestic matter of this nature should take a look at our own history . 
   any evil is a necessary evil , so long as it is n't happening to you right ? 
    pretty much . 
  you could have saved yourself some time and just posted that . 
   a dictatorship will always crack and throw it 's state into a various level of disarray . 
  i 'm a big proponent of the idea that collapsing dictatorships more or less always lead to a significant period of chaos . 
  the more stifling the dictatorship the worse the period of chaos will be . 
  simply because dictators do not allow institutional power / authority / organization to exist outside of their direct control . 
  so when the dictator ( and thus the institutions which are directly dependent on him / her ) disappear there is nothing left behind . 
  and worse there is no history or tradition governance . 
  it is not surprising that in such an environment violence and tribalism makes the most sense . 
  i 'm not claiming that the intervention in iraq / libya / syria are the very best way to go about this . 
  you can always look at a situation and say `` that could have been done better if we 'd gone about it this way '' . 
  but to suggest that because things are now a mess the best solution is to just prop up dictatorships in the me or wherever we want forever for the sake of stability is pretty disgusting . 
  making that deal with the devil is part of how we got to where we are in the first place . 
  i say part of because i 'm getting pretty annoyed by the narrative that ** anything and everything ** which happens in the me is a direct result of western action / inaction / etc. 
  when in reality the people of the me have their own motives / drives / desires and they are actually capable of making decisions both good and bad without the west being directly responsible . 
   they were often the ones to initiate the conflict whereas in the middle east the rebels started this mess . 
  read a history book would you ? 
  the middle east dictators started no small number of wars / conflicts . 
  the reason they more or less cut it out for the last couple of decades was because starting those conflicts has been a reliable way to get a gbu put through the roof of your favorite yacht . 
  they were n't the instigators of conflicts simply because they could not reasonably expect to win any such conflict . 
   saddam was basically a fascist but assad and especially gaddafi did a lot to develop their countries and if you claim . 
  demonstrates your grasp of the history , saddam actually did ** a ton ** to help develop iraq . 
  he was a very carrot and stick guy , do what i say because it 'll turn out better for you , and if you do n't that man over their will rip your teeth out . 
  but iraq flourished under most of saddam 's regime , foreign sanctions damaged iraq far more than mismanagement by the baathists . 
   libya is better off now you 're just an idiot . 
  even if it does stabilise it 'll take decades to catch up to it 's old level of development , and from there on it 's just speculation what would 've been better . 
  i most definitive ** did not ** say that libya was better off . 
  what i said is that gadaffi is gone and what comes next is up to the libyan people . 
  germany was obviously better off under hitler than under the weimar republic . 
  south africa was economically better off under apartheid and zimbabwe was economically better off as rhodesia . 
  the point is that `` being better off '' is not the sole metric of human aspiration . 
  some people would prefer to live in a country where they can criticize their government without being strung up by the balls . 
  what is the exchange rate between civil liberty and gdp ? 
  is freedom of speech worth more or less than 5 percentage points ? 
  is the right to a fair trial worth 10 points of only 7.5 ? 
   that 's the best case scenario by the way ... no the best case scenario is that the libyan people develop an at least marginally equitable system of governance with actual rule of law . 
  where the people of libya have rights , so they can live in a country where they can not arbitrarily be murdered by the head of state because he felt like it . 
  if they get that and it takes them two decades to reach their current level of development they might think it was a fair trade . 
  or maybe not , one way or the other it 's up to them at this point . 
  nice to see that some people are still willing to remember what bastards these people ( saddam , gaddafi , assad ) are / were . 
  seems there 's a trend in western culture right now to ignore any level of dictatorial bullshit so long as stability at home is preserved . 
  any evil is a necessary evil , so long as it is n't happening to you right ? 
  i get it , libya is n't a thriving liberal democracy four years after their dictator is dead . 
  but last time i checked europeans spent the better part of three decades murdering each other with extreme prejudice . 
  and nobody tries to claim that keeping stalin , hitler , mussolini , franco , salazar , was preferable to the current situation . 
  war fucks shit up , people who do n't deserve to die are going to die , stability is shattered and stability is often preferable to chaos even when your stability is guaranteed by homicidal maniacs . 
  but unless you are willing to go back to living under dictators yourselves you 've got no fucking right to suggest that stability is worth more than liberty . 
  libya is not a functional country yet , it may not be for some time , and anybody who thought that intervention in libya would lead to an immediate transition into some sort of democratic utopia is hopelessly naive . 
  the intervention put an end to gadaffi , what comes after is for other people to figure out . 
  the french helped to remove british control over the american colonies , what came after was n't up to them . 
  life is n't always clean and simple , sometimes people die who do n't deserve it , but the libyan people have a right to figure out shit for themselves . 
  maybe that will be better for them , maybe it wo n't , but that is n't the point . 
  to suggest otherwise is to argue that apartheid was acceptable because south africa was economically better off when the white people were in charge . 
  it 's fucking pathetic that people who will flip shit over a government spying on their porn preferences . 
  will simultaneously allow for the exercise of absolute authority for the sake of maintaining order in ** someone else 's ** country . 
   once the documents are ` discovered ' , they will be available to all other countries mulling a lawsuit against vw . 
  the damage will compound fast . 
  i think this is the point vw and germany do n't really have much leverage against the united states . 
  but they 've got a lot of leverage across europe ( plenty of cities and towns across europe that are pretty dependent on vw ) . 
  they 're better off taking the monetary hit by being obstinate here then giving a tool to countries and people that they can beat into submission . 
  albion levels have maximized . 
  but ... my authrotah ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  do you know how much an aircraft carrier costs ? 
  do you know how much all the training and personnel to make an aircraft carrier work costs ? 
  do you know how much a helicopter costs , or a c-130 , or how expensive they are to maintain , and how long it takes to train pilots / crews / maintenance teams ? 
  the thing about all of this stuff is that we might only spend a tiny fraction of that time actually helping the philipines , or haiti , or indonesia , or nepal , or japan . 
  but to be able to help when things go to shit you have to be prepared ** all of the time ** . 
  you can not order up a brand new super carrier to make 90,000 gallons p/day of fresh water in indonesia after the tsunami hits , you have to have it before hand . 
  we spend 600 + billion dollars a year on our military not so that we can use it all of the time . 
  we spend 600 billion years so that it 's there , ready to be used , when it is needed . 
  and if you are n't ready to use it , you might as well not have it , but being capable of doing things is monstrously expensive . 
  ahhh i love the romanians , such fun people . 
  cute , but i do n't give a fuck . 
  reality check , russia was ** once ** , significant , you were ** once ** on the cutting edge of space exploration and technology . 
  you are n't anymore , you 're a petro-state with a male mortality rate so high that 25 % of men are dropping dead before the age of 55 because they 've got a bad habit of drinking antifreeze . 
  you 're spending what little money you 've got fronting like the tough guy and the rest of the world is passing you by . 
  we are n't working together until ** your ** country gets its shit together . 
  which there is no evidence of them doing any time soon .
