  so until you people are ready to stop cluster fucking ukrainian farmers and georgia herders we do n't have shit to say . 
  if you 're doing an experiment in the lab and you do n't get the result you 're expecting ** that ** is n't a fuck up . 
  if you drop a beaker of flammable liquid and burn down your lab ** that ** is a fuck up . 
  just because you 're doing science does n't mean that you do n't and that you ca n't fuck up . 
  when you crash your spaceships into a planet , or forget to charge the battery first , that 's a fuck up . 
  we should be , but we are n't because you 've got a crackpot leader that would rather flex muscle than have a functional country , and become another subject of the `` evil empire '' . 
  there 's going to be no `` working together '' until all the bull shit stops . 
  and since stopping all the bullshit is a direct threat to putin 's authority , and since the russian people do n't have any interest in shutting that bull shit down . 
  we are n't going to be friends and colleagues any time soon . 
  hate us cause they ai n't us . 
  1 ) first man on moon , and back again , ** six times ** 2 ) only nation to explore every planet ( or ex planet ) in our solar system 3 ) first gps 4 ) first tv transmission from space 5 ) first ** successful ** mars landing , but hey the soviets fucked it up three times first , so a for effort ? 
  6 ) first and only rover ever landed on mars 7 ) first man made object to leave the solar system 8 ) most powerful rocket ever launched or built 9 ) first orbital insertion and return of the first stage booster ( recent ) 10 ) first space plane ever built or launched and only manned space plane ever used . 
  11 ) 335 american astronauts , 2.86 x 's more than the russians have sent , and more than ** 30x 's ** more than the next nation after that . 
  ... oh sorry , i mean , ho-hurrrr we done took a shit on the moon and went back to bed . 
  why , because it 's unnecessarily aggressive and hostile which ultimately weakens the strength of an argument which stands on its own without resorting to name calling ? 
  you are n't wrong , i just do n't care , i 'm not trying to be convincing . 
  if you honestly think that / u/qdegtjulo has a legitimate point there 's no arguing with you , and i 'm not going to try to convince you . 
  implying that space x 's failure to land a few rockets after making an orbital insertion , something which had never been done before , as evidence of incompetence , is stupid . 
  full stop , if you think that you 're a moron , with no knowledge and no capacity for rational analysis . 
  so yeah , i get that calling someone an idiot is n't the most convincing way to end an argument . 
  but i do n't really care about karma , and i do n't really care about being convincing at the moment . 
  this sophomoric need to always have our stupid fucking opinions respected is like a shitty offshoot of the political correctness movement . 
  do n't call me an idiot , my opinions are valid , we 're just going to have to agree to disagree , blah , blah , blah . 
  the guy above is an idiot , and really that 's all that needs to be said about it . 
  sorry if some people think i should be more sensitive with the handicapped but i 'm not in the mood . 
   yes , the company that loses a few modules space x has had a single outright launch failure , and one engine problem that could have been corrected but iss safety regulations prevented a second stage re-light . 
  this resulted in a failure to insert a satellite into proper orbit but would not have been a risk to crew safety or the ability of crew to return home to earth . 
  but hey , [ soyuz rockets never have launch failures right ? ] ( http://www.space.com/29411-russian-cargo-spaceship-crash-soyuz-rocket.html ) . 
   the ones they do n't lose sometimes tip over after landing ahhh right so space x which has been attempting to , and now succeeded at , doing something which ** no country or government has ever done before ** . 
  should be seen as incompetent because they did n't stick the landing on the first attempt ? 
  you 've got to be kidding me . 
  ** tldr : ** you 're and idiot . 
   both that 's not exactly true , even the original dragon was built to handle crew . 
  it 's more or less totally a ( very sensible ) bureaucratic / safety concern issue . 
  but in some sort of armageddon , bruce willis needs to save the world , situation . 
  space x ** could ** put him up there , and if we lost the access to the soyuz and we really needed to get into space fast throwing the necessary funding and support behind space x could get us there within a few months , i think . 
   so peacetime rules apply normally for rules of engagement . 
  no , they do n't , the rules of engagement are basically whatever turkey decides they are . 
  at the end of the day this is turkish sovereign territory that they have an internationally recognized legal right to defend . 
  how / if / when they choose to defend that sovereignty is up to them . 
  generally speaking nations which are * basically * friendly towards each other test these boundaries without escalating . 
  but that was not the situation in this case , russia was behaving in an extremely antagonistic manner towards turkey . 
  and ** then ** they chose to violate turkish air space giving turkey every legal right to respond . 
  russia earned its bloody nose fair and square . 
  georgia ( as a country ) has very strong ties with the united states . 
  they 've been with us in large numbers ( considering their size ) in both iraq and afghanistan . 
  we 've partnered with them on domestic development and law enforcement goals ( human trafficking ) with great positive effect . 
  during the russian invasion we were pretty un-ambiguous regarding our support for georgia and our condemnation of russian action . 
  we delivered civilian aid to georgia , but that aid was delivered by military ships and aircraft . 
  so at the national level georgia and america are very close . 
  as far as the actual people 's views on the subject it 's always harder to say . 
  i 'd imagine that georgians more or less like * us * . 
  but there 's always some complexity here , maybe some georgians feel like pawns in a bigger game . 
  maybe they feel that we should have done more after the russian invasion , that obama should have perhaps been less conciliatory with russia at the beginning of his term . 
  but i doubt there 's much reason to think that american is going to be considered a dirty word in georgia . 
  either russia is really passionate about copyright violations , or they want to keep people from accessing information and opinion not sanctioned by the state . 
  i bet they 're doing it because disney asked nicely ... 
  except it is n't , because mexicans have no interest in rebelling against the united states . 
  there is a disadvantage to maintaining a multi ethnic ** empire ** the multi cultural status of the united states does n't make us one bit less secure . 
  we just have better food and superior genetic diversity ( the real master race  ) . 
  hard to say , reality is always unpredictable , but i would n't be surprised if they fell by 1/3rd or 1/2 . 
   so they will simply rule by new laws but if the laws are unconstitutional they 'll be struck down right ? 
  a little bit confused here . 
  it sounds like the new polish government is in essence attempting to stuff the court with like minded judges , while also changing court rules by instituting some sort of delay on their ability to excercise rulings . 
  not completely unlike fdr 's attempt to stuff the supreme court with the help of overwhelming legislative support ( except that did n't work ) . 
  and also because the supreme court would have the opportunity to rule the new law unconstitutional ( so long as they were challenged by anyone else ) . 
  apparently the polish courts are being forced to accept new judges , and they have no legal ability to counter this legislative over reach ? 
  and further the court rule modifications gives the majority power a period where their new laws can go legally uncontested ? 
  got to say the way this article portrays it at least this sounds pretty bad . 
  because they are n't `` marginally '' better , they are an order of magnitude better . 
  real life a2a engagements like `` operation mole cricket '' demonstrate how significant the informational and ew advantage is ( it is decisive ) . 
  you 're better off with 10 planes that know where the enemy is , can jam , and can resist jamming . 
  than you are with 50 airplanes that are easy to find , can be easily jammed , and cant do much in the way of ew themselves . 
   you wo n't find me on / r/idaho telling hpw the state should be run . 
  ahhh i get it is this a case of small dick syndrome ? 
  i do n't live in idaho , i live in new york , so if you want to have a dick measuring contest we can play that game . 
  but just out of curiosity why are you hanging out on an american website , talking shit about american values , if you want to bitch about how awful it is that some people have opinions different than the majority russia is just a short hop away right ? 
  the operational costs are likely to decline , take as an example the rapid decrease in operational cost of the f-22 as experience with the aircraft grew . 
  further the f-35 is far better designed than the f-22 and a lot of the most expensive and time consuming maintenance routines ( re-application of stealth coatings ) have been improved . 
  the f-35 has much of its stealth material baked into the air frame and need to apply external coatings is very reduced . 
  finally the f-35 ( and the f-135 engine ) are still at the beginning of their full scale production . 
  as the aircraft numbers increase ( which they will do more and more quickly now ) the price of parts will decrease , the ability and experience of the crews will increase . 
  all of this is going to drive down the price in a big way . 
  finally can we please mention capability for a second ? 
  in real life if you put 20 f-35 's up against 60 gripen 's the probability is that every single gripen will die and they wo n't even engage an f-35 . 
  if you think i 'm exaggerating just go and look at the kill ratios that f-22 's have racked up in training operations like red flag . 
  the f-35 's radar , it 's ir detection , it 's passive sensing , it 's stealth , the radar it uses ( with fancy features like low probability of intercept mode , and jamming only beaten out by dedicated ew aircraft ) all of these factors are ** huge ** . 
  and that 's just what is there today , the f-35 is in its infancy and there are many many plans on how to make it way better . 
  adaptive cycle engine technology is very likely to find its first home in the f-35 . 
  http://www.geaviation.com/military/engines/adaptive-cycle/ and this stuff offers a major leap forward in engine performance , fuel efficiency , power generation , cooling capacity , etc. 
  that means that in the future the f-35 is going to be way ahead in a lot of things that are starting to matter more and like heat management and ir signature reduction , or somewhat more far fetched but not impossible high energy lasers that might have a role in a2a defense against inbound missiles . 
  then there are future weapons systems likely to make the f-35 much more dangerous . 
  the cuda missile for is likely to have similar performance to an amraam but it will be 1/2 the size . 
  and it has been designed so that and f-35 could carry 12 of them internally . 
  if you think i 'm just an f-35 / american fanboy that 's fine , but for what its worth i think i 'm offering a fairly impartial analysis of the issue . 
  and if i were in a position to choose between buying 20 f-35 's or buying 60 gripens , i would buy 20 f-35 's . 
  it is n't that i think the gripen is a bad airplane . 
  it 's just that i believe that the f-35 is such a technological leap compared to existing aircraft that 20 f-35 's are far more capable than 3x 's their number of 4 or 4 + generation aircraft . 
   why americans think their opinion is welcomed ? 
  good point , you should ban me for saying things which you 'd rather not hear .
