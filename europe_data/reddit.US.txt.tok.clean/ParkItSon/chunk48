  if israel does n't want america taking a `` nuanced '' view on the issue than maybe bibi should n't walk over a few centuries of american tradition regarding foreign statesmen giving speeches before congress without the acquiescence of the commander and chief ? 
  maybe they should n't say outright inflammatory shit about abandoning a two state solution right before an election before immediately flipping back ? 
  and honestly while i 'm a liberal i 'm not super `` anti-israel '' at some point i think it 's hard to understand what the fuck israel is supposed to do . 
  they are after all being attacked , if ineffectually , by members of the neighboring `` state '' who are supported by that state 's `` government '' . 
  if that is n't an act of war i really do n't know what is . 
  but even considering all of that the behavior of the israeli government is shit . 
  and the general attitude of israel seems to be that if we are n't giving them hugs and kisses 24/7 ( along with a metric shit ton of military equipment ) then we are n't supporting them enough . 
  israel is like a shitty girlfriend who wants to start her own business , and while you pay for rent , and utilities , and food , she gets pissed off because you do n't go out for enough nice dinners with her . 
   and i 'm still left utterly confused by how the us supposedly cares more about ` people ' than russia does i think that the difference in casualty rate between the russian invasion of afghanistan compared to the american invasion of afghanistan might be somewhat convincing ? 
  or you could look at chechnya . 
  the trend in us weapon construction over the last several decades has been about greater precision and smaller weapons with fewer explosives . 
  if our only concern was being deadly as possible without regard for civilian populations we would be using very different weapons today than we actually are . 
  itt : europeans `` wo n't somebody please think of the children , their delicate little minds ca n't deal with people who think differently from them '' . 
  ca n't wait until we have greater integration of computers into our brains , so that europe can start prosecuting thought crimes . 
  because there is a material difference between the regulation of certain actions and activities . 
  as opposed to the actual regulation of opinion and what you are allowed to say . 
  i fully acknowledged that there are technically some regulations on when and where you can say things in the united states . 
  but regulating commercial activity / institutional rules / and outright crime committed through speech are very different from legally attacking people because you do n't like what they say . 
  the restrictions on speech in europe and france are not functionally similar to the exceptions ( not restrictions because being protected and being prosecuted are different things ) that exist in the states . 
  argue with me if you want but the fact remains i can say ** literally anything short of threatening violence ** in the united states and nothing will happen to me . 
   every country has restriction on freedom of speech . 
  that is n't really true , there are basically no restrictions on speech in the united states . 
  the restrictions on free speech here are n't really restrictions on speech , they are restrictions on incitement to violence / panic or outright fraud . 
  `` speech '' is only restricted when it is being used in activities which would otherwise be illegal . 
  you ca n't yell fire in a crowded building , and you ca n't secretly set up a fog machine to convince people that there is a fire . 
  similar restrictions for outright fraud . 
  but when it comes to actual ** speech ** the expression of your views or opinions , there are no restrictions on what you can say . 
  it 's outright ludicrous ( to me ) to suggest that you can fine someone just because they say something you do n't agree with . 
   yea yea , whine whine want more handouts . 
  germany ** benefits ** more than anybody else in the union and when we actually expect some countries to ** directly compete with an industrial power house with a population of 80 million people , navigable rivers , and a flat and easily manipulated geography ** for once they start ** pointing out that not every country can have a massive trade surplus ** . 
   nothing worse than an ** elevated ** beggar who thinks he got where he is without an ounce of help . 
  is that what you meant to say ? 
  there is a point when it becomes kind of stupid / crazy . 
  if you ignore the economies of scale for too long you damage your own abilities ** and ** ultimately kill the industry just the same . 
  france is quite frankly too small of an economy to developing these aircraft on its own . 
  it would make far greater sense to work in a consortium with other european nations . 
  in the end both the industry and french capabilities will be severely reduced . 
  because if you spend the huge amounts of money to develop these aircraft and only produce a few hundred the unit price will be enormous , even though the capabilities are n't extraordinary . 
  what you end up with is very expensive airplanes that are outclassed , and less economical than their rivals . 
  in any sort of remotely realistic combat scenario the f-35 would eat the rafale for breakfast , but they are similarly priced . 
  which explains why only those countries which are n't cleared to purchase f-35 's have really been willing to buy the rafale . 
  i 'm not arguing with you that i think it makes sense to support the industrial capabilities through these programs . 
  just that france needs to swallow some of its pride and work with other partners or they 'll be left way behind . 
   focusing on the prospect of nuclear war might make sense . 
  good points , it makes a lot of political sense in a way . 
  if putin can drive the dialogue back into mad territory that 's probably a good thing for him . 
  because like you pointed out , at least there he 's on an even playing field `` you destroy us , we destroy you '' . 
  talking about literally anything else , economics , technology , life expectancy , heath outcomes , even conventional military ability . 
  any of those topics and russia seems to be losing , they seem weak . 
  but in the game of `` i can destroy the world '' they 've got themselves an indisputable binary `` win '' ( or at least equality ) . 
  so do n't let putin play that game , nuclear annihilation is a stupid thing to waste words on . 
  if it happens it happens and we 're all fucked but its a stupid conversation `` i 'll nuke you , no i 'll nuke you , ** no i 'll nuke you ! ** '' . 
  do n't rise to the bait , do n't let putin push the conversation in that ridiculous and ultimately pointless direction . 
  i do n't disagree but if you 're going to do it then do it . 
  it 's crazy to spend so much developing these very expensive air frames and then to just build ( in the case of the rafale for example ) less than two hundred of them . 
  ef is / was considerably more expensive than the f-35 is / will be in terms of unit cost . 
  because we 're planning to build several thousand of the things the development cost will be distributed across 3k + air frames . 
  if germany and a european consortium want to develop an all new attack aircraft it will almost certainly be more expensive than just buying the f-35 . 
  the only way it could be less is if they decide to build some sort of very basic / very simple / utilitarian aircraft for the role . 
  something where they pretty much know exactly what they 're doing from the start . 
  and if they do that it would sort of defeat the purpose . 
  if you 're trying to nurture and maintain a high tech industry building relatively low-tech / tried and true is not the way to go . 
  which means that if they want to build something new they probably are planning to build something new and cutting edge . 
  and the thing about doing new and cutting edge things is that you have n't done them before . 
  the f-35 has n't been so difficult to build because the people who are building it are stupid . 
  its taken so long because they are doing a ton of new and very complex things . 
  and these are people from companies who have ** already ** built three stealth aircraft . 
  if europe wants to build an attack airplane with abilities like the f-35 then they are going to have to do a lot of things they have never ever done before . 
  and it 's going to take a very long time , and it 's going to be very expensive , and then once they 're finished they are n't going to sell too many planes ( because frankly all of europe combined buys only a small fraction of warplanes that the usaf and usn buy ) . 
  that means that whatever they build , the development costs are n't likely to be spread over more than a few hundred air frames . 
  ** tldr ** : big development costs and small production numbers mean very expensive unit price . 
   countries are not ceo 's , they are way more like thugs . 
  or in more fancy academic terms , while ** people ** exist in a society of laws where rights ( and restrictions ) are established by an effort of social will . 
  countries exist in an anarchic world where the ultimate law is ( unfortunately ) might makes right . 
  in the national arena the only law that truly matters is the law of ability , the ability to defend what is `` yours '' or in reverse to take what is `` theirs '' . 
  while in recent decades we 've made some significant strides towards curbing `` might makes right '' it is still ultimately the law of force which dictates how nations behave . 
  that is why crimea now belongs to russia , because russia has the ability to take it , and there is no one responsible for punishing them for violating `` the law '' . 
  international law is a meaningless term so long as no mechanism for enforcing that law truly exists . 
   first and foremost a country must have a monopoly on force . 
  that is a generally understood definition of a state / society , but it 's important to add a word `` a monopoly of ** legitimate ** force . 
  within most nations the government ( which is sometimes and extension of the people ) has a monopoly on force in order to ensure the compliance to agreed upon laws / social conduct . 
  laws are not enforced randomly , or by just anyone , they must be enforced by the state to be legitimate . 
  no such equivalent exists on the global stage , so you are n't wrong in pointing out that nations are more like thugs than ceo 's operating within a mutually agreed upon social order . 
  that being said . 
   do n't fool yourself the threat of force by the usa is what keeps the status quo , like great britain before and other countries as far back as the roman empire . 
  i do n't disagree with you here but the united states has notably made some strides towards establishing a system which * potentially * allows for the creation of a monopoly of legitimate force , which could in essence act like the world police . 
  the u.s. currently does the vast amount of the heavy lifting in this regard . 
  but nato / un security council , etc , these are at least a nod towards the possibility of the establishment of a legitimate arbiter of force . 
  i 'm not saying we do n't ignore nato and the un sometimes . 
  but as the preeminent global power it is at least promising that we pay lip service to the concept of consensus regarding military action rather than just saying `` we 're going to do whatever we want because you ca n't stop us '' . 
  we 're still in the very early stages but the most basic framework for some sort of world government can be seen in these organizations . 
   to use your own analogy those ceos are powerless and unimportant compared to the man whit the gun if they do n't have more guys whit guns ( police ) to protect them and their valuables . 
  fair point , but it illustrates some elements of what i 'm saying as well . 
  in the world with police and law the guy with the gun is in big trouble , in a world without police and without laws he 's powerful . 
  but human progress has rested in no small part on ** reducing ** the role of violent force in the exercise of `` power '' . 
  why invent / create / build / plan / dream / imagine / explore in a world where all of your efforts can be confiscated by those with force ? 
  in essence the protection of private property , the ability to safely benefit from the fruits of your labor , has created a great incentive to produce more . 
  that is in no small part why `` free '' societies have tended to outclass autocratic states in just about everything that matters . 
  but where there are winners there are losers . 
  in a society of law , the loser is the person who used to be able to take what he wanted by force .
