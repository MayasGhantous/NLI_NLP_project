  if that person loses the ability to exercise force as the means by which to achieve their goals what do they have left ? 
  well in the case of russia , not much , russia 's primary asset these days its ability to exercise force to get what it wants . 
  and if your mindset is force  everything else , you see the world in terms of a zero sum game . 
  anything which benefits anyone who is n't you , reduces your relative strength . 
  say an estonian at an estonian university creates some sort of amazing invention . 
  this invention will greatly benefit estonia ( as the creator ) though also the world . 
  but if you 're russia you might think `` anything which benefits estonia , harms me , and so i will take ( through force ) their invention , strengthening myself '' . 
  that 's the zero sum way to view the problem , and that is the world in which russia operates . 
  because as a state they do not see themselves as having great capabilities beyond their ability to use force . 
  of course that is not the only way to consider the world . 
  if you think positive sum , estonia creating a new invention might greatly benefit estonia , but it might also greatly benefit other parties . 
  the united states might for example want access to the estonian invention just like russia does . 
  but instead of seeing estonian strength as lessening their strength you can choose to see an estonian victory as also benefiting the united states . 
  while in the zero sum strategy it might make sense to take what you want . 
  in the positive sum strategy you recognize that the success of others does not necessarily cause you harm . 
  and further that in the long term fostering an environment of in which invention flourishes you most strengthen yourself by allowing others to succeed and benefiting from their success . 
   what happened in the last 2 years proves that . 
  is being a significant threat , and a significant world power the same thing ? 
  being destructive is relatively easy , it does n't make you important or significant , just dangerous . 
  if an armed gunman breaks into a meeting between the ceo 's of 5 of the worlds largest companies , does that man suddenly become the one of the key business figures on the planet ? 
  i personally would n't say so , that man could have great impact on the business world ( by shooting some ceo 's say ) but that does n't make the man truly significant . 
  his significance is entirely dependent on his ability to cause great harm . 
  but he personally has very little ability to enact change , or impact the world , beyond his ability to fuck shit up . 
  in my eyes russia is in a similar position , they are not a significant power in most meaningful ways . 
  they are significant primarily for their ability to destroy things ( should they so choose ) . 
  that means you ca n't ignore them , you 've certainly got to consider their existence very carefully . 
  but it still does n't make them significant beyond their ability to cause a mess . 
  it 's weird to think about just how much basically two people ( parker and stone ) have influenced global culture . 
  i mean i know others have had far greater impact . 
  but parker and stone are just ... silly . 
  that 's what you get for working with irrational , aggressive , and reactionary partners . 
  germany can do its damn best to keep europe for responding too aggressively to russian aggression . 
  but they have considerably less influence with russian reaction to international incidents . 
  i 'm not saying it 's any sort of credible threat against russia , what i 'm saying is that it 's a political statement . 
  we are here , nato is here , the plan to place missiles in poland would n't have put a dent in the russian nuclear threat either . 
  but russia was still upset about the emplacement . 
   that will defend against potential attacks from ** iran ** ahhhh hahahahaha, 
   germany says it will help ** german ** energy security , by allowing russia to keep supplying ** german ** customers if it has another dispute with ** other states which are technically german allies ** . 
  really , does anymore need to be said ? 
  step one , rob someone , step two , get punched in the face for trying to rob someone , step three , sue the person for damages to your face . 
  the stupidity is baffling . 
  just fyi i blame them , the thing about anything security related in the us is that there always political pressure for their to be more cautious ( except relating to gun ownership ) . 
  but there is very little pressure from the other side to accept greater ( even if minimal ) risks . 
  the reason for this is pretty simple , the moment that something bad happens ( terrorist attack / faulty air bags / criminal re-offence ) people get very upset and claim that something * obviously * should have been done . 
  the attack should have been predicted , safety regulations should have been more stringent , the prisoner should never have been released . 
  the problem is that the potential consequences for being `` weak on security '' are far greater than the potential rewards for saying `` risk is a part of life , we need to mitigate but we can not eliminate risk , we must pick and choose where we apply our efforts '' . 
  so there is very little political incentive to `` weaken '' security ( weaken is in quotes because i do not necessarily accept that all security measures actually complement our security ) . 
  because if something goes wrong you will be politically punished , even if the measures you weakened would n't have prevented an event . 
  i 'm happy to hear the eu is considering putting pressure on us regarding this issue . 
  specifically because outside pressure is n't subject to the same political concerns . 
  if we fold to the eu regarding at least some of their visa demands that is a diplomatic decision , not an american politician being `` weak on security '' for no reason . 
  ** tldr ** : the us security policies are very often needlessly cautious , often with little or no added security benefit . 
  internal political pressure always slants towards erring on the side of caution . 
  external pressure is not subject to the same concerns and i think we really need some of it to make necessary changes . 
   i never heard of any romanian who did n't get the tourist visa for us ( if he had a job and normal situation ) i do n't consider a visa requirement to be a minor thing , for one thing i hate paperwork , so there 's that . 
  but more importantly having to apply for a visa makes a big difference in how you do things . 
  if i want to go to romania , i decide when i want to go , i buy a plane ticket , i go to romania . 
  if a romanian wants to come to america they have to apply for a visa , wait an indeterminate amount of time , and finally if the visa is accepted they can then plan the vacation / trip within the boundaries of that visa . 
  sure it is n't the end of the world but that 's a huge functional difference . 
  most significantly i ** know ** that i can travel to romania and a romanian does ' t know they can travel here without first getting a signed permission slip . 
  that 's bullshit . 
  and i fucking hope the eu does pressure the us on this issue . 
  what 's the point in having a second liberal `` super power '' in the world if we are n't going to pressure each other to make necessary changes . 
  the american immigration policy is fucking ridiculous , it 's apparently written by a bunch of paranoid pussies . 
  and no one in our government challenges it because ** if ** something happens and someone gets through the net and they 're on the record as being `` weak on border control '' they 'll get fried by the pundits . 
  this is exactly the situation where we need a significant external power to say `` look , i understand you have security concerns but this arrangement is imbalanced , and we ca n't continue it unless you make some changes '' . 
  so long as it is an external force applying the pressure we 've got reason to change and no politicians need to be on the record as being `` weak on border security '' . 
  because russian troops are being semi regularly captured in ukraine , because russia recently invaded crimea , claimed that they had n't , that it was occupied by `` rebels '' , and then a few months later released a bunch of documentaries about the successful conquest of crimea . 
  also because international observing organizations have reported a steady flow of russian equipment and personnel across the border . 
  and because russian soldiers have been mysteriously dying while `` in training accidents '' and their families receive no real explanation . 
  in short ** because the russians are in ukraine and everyone who is n't a kremlin shill is well aware that this is the case ** . 
  fucking hell , is europe secretly populated by right wing redneck americans but instead of southern twang they 've got a fancy accent and a venerable family tree ? 
  your entire post can be summed up as `` wo n't someone think of the children ! '' . 
  it 's honestly embarrassing that people are willing to even seriously consider this idea . 
  `` no little timmy you are n't ready for the internet yet , you are n't old enough , also you were delivered by a stork . '', 
  sorry to burst your bubble kids but this world is what it is , sheltering kids from reality will only make the culture shock worse when they figure out the whole world is n't a liberal arts college campus . 
  your point is that `` rebels '' america supports are actually american regulars ? 
  til : estonian is operated by my retiring father . 
  seriously , ever since he stopped working its just quad copters and getting quad copters out of trees . 
  better watch out for that `` nigger jew jazz '' right guys ? 
  before i get banned njj was a term used by the nazis to describe the genre . 
   degenerate music '' was an exhibit sponsored by the nazi regime that singled out `` degeneracy '' or the use of atonal music , jazz , discordant-sounding organization of tones, 
  maximum sentence for rape in the netherlands is 12 years . 
  hey now , they could imprison the guy for 12 whole years . 
  after that i 'm sure he 'll be rehabilitated . 
   once you find it on a map ill tell you where i 'm really from . 
  but i do n't care , and i doubt it matters . 
  i care about your opinions about as much as the world cares about luxembourg . 
  i get that you 're feeling fussy about your mediocre dick size . 
  but why do n't you just go cry into one of those piles of ill gotten money your country lives and breathes on . 
  in the mean time we 'll keep , you know , actually doing things . 
  i get it you 're but hurt about america . 
  guess how much i care ? 
  oh please , you 're going to claim that this conflict ultimately stems from the fact that we drive suv 's and keep our homes at a balmy 72 degrees all winter long ? 
  the fact that fossil fuels , and power dynamics , and these sorts of things exist . 
  the fact that normal people live their lives without thinking about how a grocery store purchase impacts geo-politics . 
  does not change the fact that these conflicts can be , and have been , resolved in a peaceful and productive manner . 
  the fact that there are problems in the world caused by an aggregation of human activity . 
  does not absolve of us `` caring '' or choosing to act when another problem arises . 
  here 's an analogy .
