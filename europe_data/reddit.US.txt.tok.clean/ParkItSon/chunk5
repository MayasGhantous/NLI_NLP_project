  they 're able to continue to exist as companies because the chinese system allows large organizations to get cheap loans to keep the ghost alive . 
  that does n't mean that they want to give these apartments away , or sell them at bargain basement prices . 
  the moment they do that they have to take the loss of making the initial bad investment . 
  this process will continue until these companies are no longer able to roll over their debt . 
  then there will be massive bankruptcies throughout the chinese system . 
  because we are also a country so monumentally powerful that our dominance can not meaningfully be challenged in any way ( though this is changing in some parts of the globe ) . 
  this has led to an unusual world where the old school power politics no longer apply . 
  the negotiating of access to markets and materials has been reduced to nothing more than negotiation . 
  because military ability is so skewed towards one nation we 've in essence removed force as a plausible option for most negotiations . 
  because any use of military force in a negotiation is likely to warrant an american response . 
  this keeps trade lanes opens and has restricted international relationships to business relationships . 
  which most countries are far happier with any way , people do not go to war because they are bastards . 
  they go to war because they feel like their interests are threatened . 
  in the modern world most everyones interests are guaranteed by the americans , and even should you feel your interests are threatened by us , military intervention is a total non-option , so other routes must be taken . 
  the major reason that wwi or wwii will not happen again anytime soon is not because we 've developed better ideologies . 
  but because conflict is both unnecessary and unproductive for most of the nations on earth . 
  germany has no need to go to war with anyone , it 's access to resources and markets is guaranteed , same with japan . 
  while america may in a sense be a threat to germany and japan if it really wanted to be it is a threat so large it can basically be ignored . 
  because a threat which you can do nothing about is not something worth worrying much about . 
  the arrogance of europe is thinking that the problems of the past were fundamentally human failings which we have overcome through enlightenment . 
  this is not the case , while germany 's aggressive ideologies may have been abhorrent these ideologies were products of fear and desperation . 
  so long as germany was strong it was a threat to other nations , and it was threatened by them . 
  even committed wholly to peace this would have been the case . 
  german industrialization then as now was a threat to the economies of other european nations . 
  while restriction of markets or resources was a threat to germany . 
  how could anyone expect germany to live under the threat of economic destruction and not seek the means to defend itself ? 
  if other countries refused to import german goods , or refused to sell germany raw materials at reasonable prices germany would be ruined . 
  germany had no means to compel others to import their product , no means to compel others to sell them materials . 
  and in their success ( even if that success was entirely peaceful ) germany was a threat to these countries as well . 
  the only logical thing for germany to do was to defend itself , and the only way to do that was with its military . 
  this problem was not resolved by ww1 , after which germany remained powerful , but also vulnerable . 
  while the atrocities and anger during ww2 was a product of how germany was treated following the first world war germany 's needs and fears were the same as always . 
  the holocaust and many german atrocities had no purpose , these things were basically national madness . 
  these things did certainly stem from the insane ideology , of an insane man , but even had germany been treated equitably following the first war , they 're needs and their insecurities would have remained . 
  ww2 resolved these issues because in the end germany 's needs were met , and their insecurity was in a sense made irrelevant . 
  what europe has failed to learn from the world wars is that there are things which can not be negotiated into submission . 
  germany has once again become the most powerful nation in europe , and it is once again a threat to others . 
  this time that threat has been mitigated by the fact that the military option has been removed from play , but the economic threat is real . 
  german exports threaten the economies of all other european nations , while germany 's own interest would be threatened by trade restrictions or failure to honor debt repayments . 
  the germans can be as ideologically sensitive as they want but this is the reality which cares little for such things . 
  either germany will with time find some way to surrender its wealth and power to europe as a whole creating a true european state . 
  or the tension between germany and the rest of europe will one day destroy the union and this will in turn very deeply damage germany . 
  at the end of the day what matters is power , europe could be powerful and peaceful if truly united . 
  but until europe over comes that final hurdle it will remain a continent in conflict . 
  for now that conflict will be relocated to economics but this may not always be so . 
  the eu was founded on the promise of peace and prosperity , so what if those things flee from time to time ? 
  what if it flees in some but not others , what if some eu nations feel threatened by war , some by economic hardship , and some by neither ? 
  is europe united it , or like in the past , is europe in conflict with itself ? 
   these ideologies are the core that caused ww2 if germany were greece their ideology would n't matter , ideology is secondary to ability * always * . 
  so if you say ideology was the primary cause of anything is untrue , because before ideology can have any impact you must first generate the capacity to act . 
  so before anything else is considered you need to understand how the capacity act develops and is sustained . 
  you seem to understand this yourself , but you do n't attribute it the importance it deserves . 
   other prerequisites for ww1 are also gone , like absolute monarchy , isolated national populations wholly dependent on internal mass media and little contact with other peoples , ** isolated markets ** and no free movement of people , few intergovernmental organizations or ways to resolve conflicts , and more . 
  the other things may cause international aggravation but they will not cause wars in themselves . 
  when germany coalesced prior to wwi it suddenly became the most powerful state in europe , but a deeply insecure state . 
  unlike france or great britain germany had no empire , and no global access to resources . 
  germany then ( as now ) was an industrial powerhouse which needed ( and needs ) access to raw materials , and markets . 
  without either of these two things germany collapses . 
  thus all the other states of europe are simultaneously a market which germany needs , and an impediment to germany should they in any way inhibit germany 's access to resources . 
  this fact was the driving force behind german military expansion , because germany then ( as now ) was totally vulnerable to outside forces . 
  this desperate fact was only ended by american hegemony , and free trade guarantees . 
  these guarantees fundamentally altered the world that germany was living in , because with american guaranteed free trade and access to the american markets germany was no longer dependent on / beholden to any european nation . 
  access to their markets is certainly very important but it was suddenly no longer the death sentence that it was . 
   you seem to hold a frankly insulting opinion that it 's somehow something related to europe as a whole , but not to america or other places . 
  it ** is ** related to europe as a whole and many other places . 
  it is somewhat uniquely not related to the united states not because we are exceptional but because our geography is . 
  europe was able to conquer the world but due to the geography of europe it was never able to conquer itself . 
  the european nations are dependent on each other and also in competition with each other . 
  dependency , and competition , lead to fear , which in time leads to war . 
  the last 7 decades have been unique in that europe fell under soviet and american hegemony , and now just american hegemony . 
  the united states through free trade policies has guaranteed most of the nations in the world the right to trade without restrictions . 
  which now means that in many cases the only country other countries are truly indispensably dependent on is the united states . 
  the united states is in a uniquely good position to play this role compared to most nations . 
  once again not because we are inherently superior in any way but because we have a superior piece of territory , and the benefit of the fact that this territory was colonized during a technological period where rapid colonization / transportation made unity relatively easy . 
  the united states is naturally protected from outside forces , while it geography allows natural internal cohesion ( few internal barriers to travel , worlds greatest river network , etc. ) . 
  add in abundant natural resources and you have a country which is safe from external threats and almost totally self reliant . 
  i 'm not saying that the united states would be richer or better off without foreign relations . 
  i 'm saying that almost uniquely the united states has everything it needs to be secure and economically dynamic without ever looking outside its borders . 
  we have all the food , energy , and raw materials that we might need for the foreseeable future . 
  with the exception of few specialty materials the united states has everything it needs right at home . 
  even markets , for germany industrialization and unification was an extremely technical project requiring immensely skilled bureaucrats to achieve . 
  the state heavily taxed workers in order to build the infrastructure necessary to for germany to thrive . 
  but this same bureaucratic brilliance and taxation means that german industry is not internally sustainable . 
  german citizens do not have the purchasing power to provide the internal market that german industry needs to be sustainable , so germany ** must ** find external markets or suffer massive unemployment and national decline . 
  the united states by contrast is so massively conducive to wealth generation that it almost happens accidentally . 
  unlike germany we 've mostly lived without large scale infrastructure projects until very late in our history . 
  capital generation here was so easy that private individuals were able to put forth the capital to finance infrastructure themselves . 
  while even `` poor farmers '' with access to the american river network could get rich selling grain at premium prices to the world thanks to insanely good transport access through the river systems and ports . 
  this holds true to present day , america generates so much capital that we are ** net importers ** compared to germany 's massive trade surplus . 
  the point i 'm making with all of this is that for this reason american hegemony is pretty benign and hands off ( yes i know , iraq , afghanistan , i get it , but in historical terms , these are microscopic conflicts ) . 
  not primarily because we are we ideologically good people , but because deeper than that we are an extremely ** secure ** people . 
  americans might be scared of terrorism but at the end of the day there is literally nothing threatening the united states short of nuclear war . 
  continued -- , 
  it 's probably some funny calculation involving population . 
  some guy in switzerland invented something cool , his neighbor also thought it was cool . 
  boom , most innovative . 
  still last time i checked they were n't building reusable rockets , while ** we ** have already blown up like five of the things . 
   it is mostly used for rabulistic though , that is the problem . 
  it 's not about forgetting or something . 
  i agree with you , when i talk about europe acting like it did n't happen i 'm talking about the mindset of .
