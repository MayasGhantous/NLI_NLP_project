  https://vimeo.com/105788896 giant sets rock , rock rolls down hill towards village , giant takes action to stop rock crushing village . 
  it 's asinine to suggest that `` if the giant had cared , he would have placed the first rock more carefully '' . 
  that is n't how people or societies work , we do things , sometimes thoughtlessly , sometimes in ignorance . 
  and when the consequences of our actions catch up with us we can do things about the consequences . 
  glad that someone gives a shit . 
  i think that 's the point being made . 
  while the world and europe fawns over celebrity gossip there is in fact a war going on right now , it what is generally regarded as the `` civilized world '' . 
  but like everything else these days after a few months media attention most people get bored and move on to a different news story . 
  it 's good to be reminded sometimes that there is still a war going on . 
  well considering the state of russia right now i would say we do in fact need to . 
  yes we technically ** could ** go around doing whatever we want , wherever we want . 
  and no one could plausibly do shit in a military sense . 
  but much of that and you end up as a pariah state that is only really significant in its capacity to cause mayhem . 
  no matter how strong you are , you ca n't bully the whole world and expect good outcomes . 
  not indefinitely at least . 
  well do you count the saudis trying to strangle us shale oil producers as a conspiracy ? 
  because that is definitely real and happening . 
  but there is no conspiracy in the sense of `` obama told the saudis to pump oil to fuck with russia '' which definitely is not happening . 
   us seems able to keep expanding eternally at a much lower price point than they 'd like . 
  this is the big thing , at the end of the day the oil and gas is there . 
  anybody saying it costs too much is ignoring the fact that the process is always being improved and experimented on . 
  if there 's a pile of gold bricks sitting on top of a high shelf , and you do n't have a ladder , you do n't say `` well those are out of reach '' , nope , you build a god damned ladder . 
  no matter what sa does , the gold is there , even if they make it harder to get at that wo n't change anything in the long term . 
  the drillers ** will ** figure out a way to get the stuff , and at a profit . 
  it also does n't hurt that their source for oil is basically sitting on top of their producers , rather than being an ocean away . 
  not if putin is n't dumb , he 's already got his fingers in more pies than he can handle . 
  adding another shit show to the fire would be a really poor decision at this point . 
  dude we are pretty much the oprah of the world . 
  you get an f-15 , you get an f-15 , ** everybody gets an f-15 ** !, 
  yeah but there the u.s. also spends millions / billions / trillions that fall outside of the normal budget . 
  operational funds are n't always included , there is also some secret funding for various clandestine units and secret development projects . 
  the u.s. spends a ton on military matters that are n't in the official defense spending budget . 
  they 've pulled off some wildly successful operations that the u.s. really did n't want them to . 
  they got their own tech and intelligence gathering . 
  israel is very good . 
  it 's very mixed , you know how it is the parent company provides capital , but there 's a lot of flexibility regarding the actual journalists ( so long as they get viewers ) . 
  i think vice has some very high quality documentary film makers . 
  the problem is they also hire a fair number of morons , who really do tabloid `` journalism '' of dubious validity . 
  and then they publish `` stories '' like [ this ] ( https://www.vice.com/read/why-i-dont-give-blowjobs-323 ) eventually it 's hard not to just think ** shut thr fuck up vice ** . 
  whenever one of their stories pops up . 
   i just pointed out a more appopriate in the eu context of nato own actions , instead of your whatabout russia . 
  not really because serbia was not a nato member that was viciously attacked for trying to leave nato . 
  it was a conflict , the united states and nato intervened and put an end to ethnic cleansing . 
  they kept the intervention as restrained as possible and minimized civilian casualties . 
   grozny was half-russian ( in ethnic sense ) city when independence was proclaimed , now it 's 3 % there ( and this figure even includes federal servicemen unlike the statistics before ) . 
  similar thing happened with ukrainians , armenians , etc. 
  in fact , only ethnic chechen population increased there , no ethnic cleansings my ass . 
  are you attempting to claim that the chechen 's attempted to ethnically cleanse the russians there ? 
  you know there 's a difference between people leaving because they do n't feel welcome , or safe , and ethnic cleansing . 
  you 've also neglected to mention that all of the places you listed were forcefully occupied and suppressed by the ** russian led ** soviet union . 
  the russian people in these countries are viewed , not without reason , as occupiers , because that is what they were . 
   and even then i 'd say those bombings were not justified . 
  it becomes even more unjustified when ` ethnic cleansings prevention ' principe is being conveniently used in rather unilateral manner . 
  and i would tell you to fuck off . 
   a bit overly dramatic  vice  a bit overly dramatic  vice  a bit overly dramatic  vice `` i had a bad apple today '' vice : ** are all apples poisonous , and are people in japan having sex or not ?!?!, 
  ** i fucking hate vice . 
  several points there . 
  the first is that isis is a poor outlet for directing public outrage . 
  because in a sense isis is not a real thing , or perhaps its more reasonable to say isis is not a concrete thing . 
  it is an ideological movement , a manifestation of chaos a creature of a power vacuum . 
  by contrast turkey is a real and concrete thing , turkey is something you can be outraged at . 
  isis is a flock of crows that live by your house and shits on your car . 
  while turkey is the neighbor who hates you because your kids are a nuisance , and in retaliation wo n't return the balls that fly over his fence . 
  the crows might piss you off , but you ca n't do much about them , and they 're happy to see that you 're pissed off . 
  even if you can knock a few down with well placed rocks you are n't going to kill off the whole flock without making a major effort . 
  at least you can barge over to your neighbors house , lean on the doorbell , spend 20 minutes shouting , at the very least you 'll have the satisfaction of pissing off the neighbor you hate and seeing how red his face gets . 
  the second reason is that ** actually ** stopping isis is something that ** no one ** is deeply interested in . 
  before you assume i 'm a conspiracy theorist wait , i do n't mean that the powers that be do n't want isis gone , i mean that they do not want to be responsible for their elimination of isis . 
  the reason that isis is able to exist in iraq , a country which technically has a ** 2.8 million ** man army . 
  is because the people of iraq do not care about iraq . 
  they care about themselves , they care about their family , they care about their tribe , but they do n't care about iraq . 
  because iraq is not a nation in the way that westerners understand the term . 
  iraq is another one of those colonial british creations that was briefly `` the kingdom of iraq '' ( at the bequest of the british ) following the collapse of the ottomans . 
  then after a military coup it was even more briefly the republic of iraq . 
  the leadership of which * attempted * to form a national iraqi identity , before they were in turn overthrown by forces within the country who had a different vision ( pan arabism ) . 
  after that you have the rise of the ba'athists and saddam . 
  who whatever else you might say about him was actually a remarkably effective leader and power broker . 
  however he made his focus building and consolidating power through the rather direct means of both giving people what they wanted , and brutally suppressing anyone who opposed him . 
  saddam cared about `` iraq '' in the sense that iraq was the source of all of his wealth and influence . 
  he was a machiavellian character , a bit like hitler but without hitler 's devotion to a surreal / fantastical `` german destiny '' . 
  hitler may have actually been a mad man , i do n't think saddam was , though he may very well have been a sociopath . 
  he was a cold blooded operator who understood how to acquire and maintain power . 
  but i do n't think he had an ounce of romanticism in him , to him the nation was his source of power and nothing more . 
  he may have even considered nationalism to be a threat , he wanted people to be loyal to him , not to the nation . 
  and so finally when saddam and his government were destroyed what was left ? 
  not much , the people who inhabit iraq today have no deep philosophical connection to the concept of iraq . 
  it 's just a place where they live , some people lived well under the dictatorship . 
  while many more people ( especially the shiites ) were prosecuted / suppressed and treated poorly under saddam , and they were happy to see him go . 
  but in both cases what we think of as iraq revolved around the regime far more than around the nation . 
  which is a round about way of saying that within iraq exists the ability to destroy isis but not the will . 
  in the case of syria the government may currently lack both the will and the ability . 
  saudi arabia and kuwait are largely unconcerned with and even even quietly supportive of isis , just so long as isis is causing problems with saudis enemies / rivals and not causing shit anywhere near their own countries . 
  jordan may ( almost uniquely ) be interested in actually destroying isis but while they might have the will they probably do not have the ability . 
  turkey is n't particularly interested in destroying isis because they present a greater threat to iran than to turkey . 
  and turkey is un-enthused about expending a great deal of blood and treasure to destroy an enemy , which would ** ultimately ** improve the position of one of their foes for very little gain for turkey . 
  iran would happily work to destroy isis , the fact that they are n't already aggressively doing so is probably an indication of their priorities and assessments . 
  they ( and other players ) consider isis to be less of a threat to the syrian regime than to other rebel factions in the region . 
  isis is something to be left alone until it is clear that they can defeat the larger resistance movement , and once that is guaranteed focus will shift to defeating isis . 
  russia is in bed with iran and syria on this point , they are unlikely to focus on defeating isis until they feel they can defeat other rebel factions and restore assad ( or similarly aligned parties ) to power . 
  after that is completed they will shift their focus to defeating isis .
