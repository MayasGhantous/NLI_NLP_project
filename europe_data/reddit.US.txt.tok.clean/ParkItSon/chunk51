  which is long winded way of saying that russia would prefer to minimize the isis focus at this time . 
  because russia is n't particularly interested in fighting isis right now , despite the fact that isis ( whatever that means ) was probably responsible for the attack . 
  russia sees turkey as a greater threat to their objectives than isis . 
  which is why at the moment russia primarily references isis as a means to demonize and discredit turkey . 
  ** tldr ** 1 ) russia would rather not focus on the fact that isis downed the plane because isis is an ephemeral ill defined organization . 
  this makes them a poor outlet for the directing of public outrage . 
  compared to turkey and erdogan a concrete entity towards which public outrage can more easily be directed . 
  2 ) russia considers turkey , to be a far more significant threat to their interests than isis . 
  putin has spent far more time focusing on isis as a means of rhetorically debasing turkey . 
  they want to use isis 's well deserved pariah status as a means to attack turkey . 
  but they are less concerned with actually attacking isis rhetorically , ** or ** militarily . 
  that is why russian the russian pr machine has placed a far greater emphasis on publicizing the downing of the su-24 by turkey than they have on the downing of the airliner by terrorists . 
  well there are reasons why that * probably * wo n't happen , but there 's no guarantee that it wo n't happen , or that it ca n't happen . 
   so you suggest crimeans should sell their soul for your starred and striped paycheck ? 
  i 'm not suggesting anything , i 'm telling you how it is . 
   authentic america !, 
  we got so much to learn , in so little time lol . 
  yeah maybe you do , what american has long understood are ** consequences ** . 
  you make choices , those choices have real impact . 
  grand gestures , and standing by your values , means shit , if you ca n't back it up with something substantial , and at the end of the day the starred and striped paycheck is just an indication of that deeper reality . 
  crimean 's can do what they want as far as i 'm concerned , but do n't come to me with your hand out when shit does n't break your way . 
  we live with the consequences of our decisions . 
  now a days , research laboratory manager . 
  if you 're wondering if i 'm wealthy , no i 'm not . 
  though family has grown consistently better off throughout my lifetime but i would say as a child my family was on the lower end of middle class . 
  but we lived in a cheap place , my parents were thrifty , and we always traveled , but we did a lot of inexpensive stuff like camping . 
  i 've travelled from coast to coast , by car and by plane . 
  i 've lived in the south west deserts , and in the blue ridge mountains . 
  i 've lived in tiny towns in the middle of nowhere , and in the heart of our largest city . 
  i 've been a ski bum who spent a winter sleeping in a van on top of a mountain to save rent , i 've camped in the rockies , fished in the rio grande , and rafted down `` the river of no return '' ( salmon river ) . 
  i 've lived in super white upper class suburban townships , and i 've been the minority in central harlem . 
  i think i know it better than most . 
  they will carry the electricity , on bears , lines are for decadent capitalists . 
  i do christen myself the king of new york , but for some reason only my dog seems to care . 
  step 1 ) do n't start ethnically cleansing people step 2 ) you wo n't get bombed and are you seriously comparing the bombing of belgrade which resulted in between a few hundred to a few thousand civilian deaths . 
  and the more than ** two hundred thousand ** civilian casualties in the most recent chechen wars . 
  sorry but those two conflicts are not the same . 
  there are lots of analysis and analysts and they 're all pretty much full of shit . 
  because the oil business is spilling over with secrets / proprietary knowledge and tech . 
  people have been saying we hit the bottom and that production would be cut the whole way down , and so far they 've been wrong . 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong , i 'm saying you do n't know . 
  if you really believe your own analysis you should be buying oil stocks in companies that can ride this out , right now . 
  leaving aside your note of sarcasm you do know that it is easy to leave nato correct ? 
  it 's an entirely voluntary organization , france left for years and only recently returned . 
  the eu is certainly more difficult to leave and no mechanism exists . 
  though i 'm relatively certain that if say romania decided to leave the eu would not turn bucharest into grozny ... 
  yes , me and most of the western world , the people with actual money and power . 
  crimea in exchange for most of the world now has what in exchange , russia ? 
  an autocratic petro state , with a declining population and a gradually falling behind military capacity ? 
  i know exactly why i ca n't reach crimea and why you can . 
  the point is that in economic terms , they just made a bad trade . 
  what a silly thing to say . 
  and just fyi i 've been buying oiler stocks heavily over the last couple of months because i basically agree with you . 
  but under no circumstances is it currently guaranteed that oil prices can only go up from here . 
  i more or less believe they will for several reasons but i could be wrong , there are a lot of loose wrenches that might fall in the gears of the global economy . 
  well for one thing ukraine is at least , ukraine , with a definite legal status . 
  crimea by contrast is now a non-country , no mans land , a place you ca n't easily reach , a place in limbo . 
  and in such a place it is questionable who exactly is in charge and responsible ? 
  and in the list of priorities where do you fall exactly ? 
  ukraine has a lot of issues , fixing crimea 's problems maybe is n't their number one concern right now ? 
  and while russia has a new strategic position they are also in a flagging economic situation and perhaps crimean 's are t their biggest concern either at the moment ? 
  that 's the thing , when you 've got non-status , who do you complain to ? 
  sorry i meant to imply that georgia would renounce the conflict and the territory prior to admission . 
  i understand that would be deeply unplatable but i think it 's understood that nato membership can not be used as a pretext for the initiation of a conflict . 
  it 's a gangrene situation , cut off the hand to save the body . 
  give it another couple of decades of russian decline and perhaps things may be re-considered but if i were ukraine or georgia today i would renounce territorial claims seek nato membership , and then bide . 
  people have the right to elect the government , and create the policies that they fill best suit their needs and desires . 
  but just because you have the freedom to make choices does not mean you should be free of the consequences of those choices . 
   governments should have the undisputed right to go back on `` promises '' , especially when the ruling party changes . 
  you 're advocating for anarchy , in your eyes any government should be allowed to break contracts just because . 
  and if a foreign company or nation sees this as unfair they should have no re-course ? 
  the problem with a system like this is that in matters of sufficient importance this leads to ** war ** . 
  if there is no law , the only law is might makes right . 
  the reason we have national and international law is that so disputes can be mediated without resorting to force . 
  but if you think a government or nation should be able to abdicate its responsibilities because * it feels like it * , then you should n't be surprised when other nations decide that is theft , and the will re appropriate their assets forcefully , with interest . 
  either we have law that protects the strong , and protects the weak . 
  or we have anarchy and the strong can do what they will because the weak ca n't stop them . 
  and what if foreign investors are n't treated fairly because they are foreigners ? 
  oh total bullshit , the primary significant opposition comes from germany and france . 
  countries which have significant economic ties with russia . 
  i think most pro-nato americans would welcome the addition of georgia to the treaty . 
  anti-nato americans just want to tell europe to fuck off and handle its own shit , but it 's nothing personal . 
  at the end of the day though the united states ca n't force the expansion of nato . 
  it must be a voluntary organization that revolves around consensus or its no better than a ussr 2.0 . 
  but for what its worth , if it were up to me georgia would have been admitted a long time ago . 
  the wests capitulation to russia over the last decade has been pathetic and nearsighted . 
  but it seems that western europe will stand against russia until it impinges on their pocketbooks and then they billfold . 
  lets flip this do you think the local investor should be favored over the foreign investor ? 
  do you really believe that a foreign company being opposed by local ** voters ** is going to get a fair trial ? 
  i know for a fact they would n't get a truly fair trial in the united states . 
  because political pressure is a real thing , and even elements of governance that should be totally a-political are in reality a part of that system . 
  and in america the political concern is about voters , no one gives a shit about pissing off some foreigners who ca n't vote . 
  maybe european nations are entirely moral and free of such concerns as local opinion and pressure . 
  the isds is the mutually approved upon body which handles arbitration in matters like these . 
  is it perfect , i 'm sure it is n't , but i can entirely understand why it exists . 
  i do n't believe that foreign companies would get truly fair trial in a controversial , local case , in my country . 
  and i do n't believe that foreign companies would get a fair and impartial trial in yours . 
  have the french changed their position on this ? 
  i was under the impression that they were opposed to further expansion of nato . 
  and since nato operates on a consensus basis that alone would be enough to derail expansion .
