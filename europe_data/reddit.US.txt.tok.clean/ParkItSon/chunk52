  though perhaps u.s. support in the isis / syria conflict carries weight , even if they are n't thrilled about expansion ? 
  what 's that ? 
  the idea that companies ( boo hiss ) and the ** people ** who work for and depend on those companies . 
  have some right to legal protection for investments they make in accordance with contractual agreements that are then violated ? 
  redditors honestly seem to believe that just because `` the people '' want something they should be exempted from any consequences of their choices . 
  according to / r/worldnews yes . 
  honestly the caliber of the debate about the syrian conflict is just plain depressing . 
  it 's not that people do n't know what 's going on there , because i do n't really know what 's going on there , and i 'm not entirely sure the experts do either . 
  but what i am sure is that i ** do not ** have a deep understanding of the conflict . 
  and so i 'm doing my best to refrain from broad brush comments like `` all rebels are isis '' or `` moderate rebels , haha '' . 
  assad is a brutal dictator , a secular dictator , but an authoritarian leader who derives his power from the threat of violence . 
  it is not surprising or unreasonable that there are many people in syria who are willing to fight and die to overthrow such a man . 
  unfortunately these people also have strong religious beliefs that clash with the perception of what westerners now consider to be `` right '' or `` moral '' . 
  though many in europe still loudly applaud the exploits of their great forefathers who built the nations they still inhabit today on what were often fundamentally religious grounds . 
  i 'm not sure what point i 'm making here , maybe no point at all . 
  just that at the end of the day these are people , while isis might be some sort of mindless death cult of zealotry . 
  i find it hard to believe that there do n't exist in syria and iraq people who believe they are fighting for what they consider to be a better way of life . 
  people who have families , and homes , and feel that they 've been put in a position where they need to fight and perhaps die for those things . 
  or maybe we 've reached that point in a conflict where war begets war , and the fighting continues though no one recalls what the original intentions were . 
  iraq is a mess , syria is a mess , was deposing the dictators ( saddam , qaddafi , now assad ) a terrible idea ? 
  i do n't know , in some ways it was these people who were truly invested in the continued existence of these un-natural me states more than any of the inhabitants . 
  maybe its time to go back to the drawing board here , and actually ask these people who they are , and what their nations would be . 
  maybe its time to find out what the shape of the me would be if it had n't been carved up by the colonial powers . 
  maybe its time to stop forcing the existence of nations that the people of these `` countries '' do n't believe in . 
  how do we do that ? 
  i do n't know , it probably would n't be cheap , or easy , and you probably could n't get support for it from liberals ( do n't get involved ) or conservatives ( we do n't negotiate with terrorists ) . 
  but what has become clearer and clearer to me is that the middle east is a problem that we do not understand . 
  we may have the capacity to help solve that problem , though perhaps not the will . 
  but if we hope to solve the problem we first need to acknowledge that their problems are not mirror images of our own . 
  the conflict between nations does not exist , when in the eyes of the people of these places nations do not exist . 
  i 'll say one thing that is concrete , lets stop writing about this conflict , about these problems , like we understand them , because we do n't . 
   it was probably an accident that they entered though . 
  really ? 
  fool me once shame on you , fool me twice , shame on me . 
  russia making the `` honest mistake '' argument does n't hold much water . 
  they 've accidentally violated the airspace over and over again . 
  best case scenario this is a case of the boy who cried wolf but in reverse . 
  russia fucks around with other countries for months , claims to be having navigation problems , and maybe just maybe the one time they had a real navigation problem turkey lost patience . 
  do n't play around with loaded guns , if you do n't want someone to get shot . 
   but he sent a puppy to the paris pd so y' know , short-term memory . 
  thank god someone else is pointing this bullshit out . 
  people fawning over this `` heartwarming gesture '' is honestly making me feel like i 'm losing my mind . 
  fucking hell this is the subject of mainstream satirical films and yet somehow people just swoon for this bullshit . 
  if they 're in syria they 've put themselves in the position by being confronted directly by a million man turkish army with tanks and mechnanized artillery . 
  shutting down the russian air force we presumably more than the motivation required . 
  meanwhile russia has no way to move significant ground troops into turkey to defend its airfields without invading georgia or azerbaijan and significantly widening the scope of the conflict . 
  airbases near georgia would actually be further from regions of turkey they might want to meaningfully engage with and russia is currently restricted by treaty from using those bases in a significant capacity anyway , so unless they want to violate those treaties no dice . 
  at the end of the day russia can not easilty attack turkey and turkey is very well equipped and well positioned to defend itself . 
   amateurs talk about tactics , but professionals study logistics . 
  russia is severely limited in the power projection capabilities . 
  the united states is one of few modern powers that makes a serious effort on its force projection capabilities . 
  we have more than ** 450 ** dedicated flying boom tanker aircraft . 
  by contrast russia has ** 19 ** just 19 , second rate probe and drogue style dedicated refueling aircraft . 
  the nearest air base that russia could access to turkey is in crimea , and it is still about 500km from turkey . 
  while an su-27 has an extremely long range for an air superiority fighter that range requires external tanks which reduces weapons load out . 
  more importantly that particular base is very small and could only accommodate a few aircraft and the crews and equipment they would need . 
  meaning the majority of aircraft would be flying from far further away . 
  launching a large coordinated attack from several airfields requires tankers , tankers , ** tankers ** . 
  and russia just does n't have those tankers , period , they do not exist . 
  what this all boils down to is that it is beyond russia 's capability to launch a significant strike force against turkey . 
  so russia could launch a very small strike force , which would give turkey and enormous local advantage . 
  wars are not fought on spreadsheets , and they are not decided over published wikipedia specifications . 
  they are decided in real world battles , and in real life the defenders advantage matters a whole fucking lot . 
  that 's why people say the way to win a battle is `` to get there firstest , with the mostest '' . 
  when it comes to defense turkey is already there , and they 've got the mostest . 
  the fact that the su-27 is a faster and more maneuverable airplane than an f-16 does n't really matter . 
  what matters is that turkey would have an enormous numeric , informational , and logistical advantage in the defense of its own airspace . 
  and that russia lacks the logistical capacity to launch a meaningful assault . 
  ahhh so you think a proportional amount of german taxes go to the common defense of the eu ? 
  do n't make me laugh . 
  the reason common defense works in the united states is because ** we all pay ** . 
  eu taxes are minimal and they are not invested in the common defense in any significant way . 
  what you 're really saying is germany has all the money and the jobs , and hopefully someone else will pay for things like defense , because we wont . 
  russian pilot also reports that he was n't flying a fighter jet at all but a biplane towing a banner saying `` we love turkey '' truly does the duplicity of the nefarious turks know no bounds ? 
  but seriously , non-turkish , civilian airliner pilots reported that they heard the warnings being broadcast for several minutes . 
  either the russians are straight up lying , or their equipment was n't working or was turned off . 
  which is quite frankly not turkey 's fucking responsibility , if you 're flying armed aircraft along another nations border , you should be god damned sure your equipment is operating properly . 
  crimea a fucking river . 
  honestly then fucking leave , but it will only further the fragmentation of europe . 
  because germany wants trade an market access , but your economy ca n't survive without exports . 
  but you do n't want any of the responsibilities of unity , of leadership . 
  so if you want to make a further mockery of european unity and solidarity by all fucking means , go ahead . 
  but it 's pathetic . 
   you seem to have a very american oriented view ( in line with your doctrine , i give you that ) . 
  in this case yes , because an american doctrinal view makes sense . 
  we 're talking about a conflict between two nations where one country with a significant advantage in ** absolute ** power . 
  is being considered as the aggressor attacking which is geographically segregated . 
  in such a conflict ** the ** major concern is logistics . 
   `` amateurs talk about tactics , but professionals study logistics . '', 
  - gen. robert h. barrow  you have n't even mentioned their navy , composed mainly of retired ships from other nations and aging diesel subs . 
  first off you 're being somewhat overly dismissive of the turkish navy 's capacity . 
  while its hardly world blue water navy , turkey is not a blue water power and they are n't trying to be . 
  one of turkey 's great strength as a military power is that they 've made the pragmatic decisions to recognize what they are and what their capacity is . 
  russia , not entirely by its own fault has a great deal of resources directed towards the disposition of great power status , even though it no longer is one . 
  what i mean by this is that if you want to have say an aircraft carrier , and you want it to be useful , you ** first ** need many other elements to meaningfully defend and assist that vehicle . 
  and if you do n't have those elements the aircraft carrier is more of an expensive liability rather than a tool for power projection . 
  russia 's fleet and its ability to maintain that fleet is also extremely reduced . 
  there is a reason that they were ordering the mistrals from france and not building helicopter carriers themselves . 
  their industrial capacity to build an maintain such ships is greatly reduced from their past abilities . 
  finally i need to re-emphasize that turkey would be in the role of defender .
