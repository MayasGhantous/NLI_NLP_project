  that means they would close off the bosporus , putting an end to both military and commercial shipping into russia 's black sea ports . 
  that would have a massive impact on russian commerce , russia would be basically totally unable to transit that route . 
  even older diesel subs are basically impossible to detect when laying in wait with their engines off . 
   now , even as a direct encounter , you seem to highly disregard the russian air force for a reason beyond my understanding . 
  they have experience , technology ( yes their bvr missiles are effective ) and probably the best close range ir missile ever made . 
  their air supremacy fighters are arguably the best dog fighter around here . 
  even if the russian air force and weapons were technologically superior to the weapons and aircraft being fielded by turkey , ( something which i consider to be very debatable but i wo n't go into here ) . 
  the fact remains that russia is attacking a country with a well trained large air force , with almost 300 fighter aircraft , with forewarning , logistics , and informational support ** right there ** while russia will be attacking at range without major support . 
  and if they bring major support that support would be ** severely ** threatened by an easily launched turkish counter attack . 
  using aircraft in a defensive capacity is perhaps and order of magnitude easier and more effective than utilizing them in an offensive capacity . 
  russia would need to fly weapons , fuel , awacs , and electronic warfare aircraft across the black sea . 
  lets just look at one element of that , say aerial refueling . 
  russia currently has about 19 dedicated aerial refueling aircraft . 
  by contrast the united states which has dedicated itself by necessity to aerial power projection has more than ** 450 ** dedicated refueling air craft . 
  that is ** 23 times ** the inventory of similar function russian aircraft . 
  what is to be understood from this is that russia ** does not have ** a meaningful long range aerial power projection capacity . 
  so any aerial conflict over turkey will inevitably mean that russia will be at a ** huge ** local numeric dis-advantage . 
  even if they had missiles that we 're ** much ** better than what turkey has , which once again , i do not accept as fact . 
  they would still be at a huge dis-advantage . 
  so lets be clear , in a defensive posture any aerial attack on turkish assets will be at . 
  1 ) a massive numeric dis-advantage 2 ) a massive informational dis-advantage as turkey will have its ground radar to detect enemy aircraft and direct a response . 
  3 ) a massive positional dis-advantage as they will be fighting over enemy territory and at risk from ground based sam systems . 
  4 ) a massive positional dis-advantage in that as the aggressor they must retreat post engagement . 
  and during that retreat they will be pursued by fully fueled , cleanly configured , and still armed interceptors . 
  while the russian jets are going to be low on fuel , out of weapons , and running . 
  and finally ** if ** they flew with support , which they would need to , that support will not be able to outrun pursuing turkish aircraft . 
  this is what would be referred to in military parlance as a cluster fuck . 
   now when it comes to the ground force , both sides have quite a vast arsenal of armed vehicles , but one is fairly disadvantage in terms of technology . 
  i let you make a simple comparison between their mbts . 
  in terms of experience , the turkish army as a whole is far from a model , while all corps of russia have been involved in numerous conflicts since wwii . 
  i am not at all clear on how you expect them to get to turkey ? 
  an amphibious assault against turkey would be outright suicidal . 
  other than that the only even slightly feasible route would be through georgia or azerbaijan , two countries with a strong dislike for russia and good relations with turkey . 
  is russia prepared to start a war with multiple countries during its attempt to attack turkey ? 
  i 'm making my analysis of the military situation based on the actual geography of the region , not a spreadsheet conflict between russia and turkey in a vacuum . 
   but stating that there is no way russia can do any arm to turkey is a bit silly . 
  i 'm not saying there is no way that russia could harm turkey , simply that turkey is more than capable of defending itself . 
  russia ** could not ** realistically defeat turkey . 
  and only decisively defeating turkey could be reasonably construed as a victory in russia 's eyes . 
  and in the long term a hostile relationship would damage russia far more than it would damage turkey as it would put an indefinite end to russian commerce through the mediterranean . 
  the economic impact of such a thing would be enormous . 
   and we are not even talking about any nuclear weapon ( do n't start me on the patriot ) . 
  if we 're talking about nuclear weapons all bets are off . 
  but in any sort of conventional conflict the defender advantage is absolutely enormous . 
  russia is a far more powerful nation than turkey . 
  but to project power across an ocean , even a small ocean requires a difference in relative power that just does n't exist . 
  russia does not have the projection capacity to seriously threaten turkey at home . 
  awww kitty, 
  on this basis getting rid of hitler would have also been viewed as poor decision making . 
  the reason these countries go to shit after the dictator is deposed is because the dictator stifles the rise of pluralistic institutions that might challenged his absolute authority . 
  so when the dictatorship crumbles there is nothing resembling a leadership structure for the people to fall back on . 
  this situation lends itself to strongmen and zealots who are suited to filling the power vacuum . 
  ultimately i fail to see this as a legitimate reason to support dictatorships . 
  instead we should understand that these situations resolve themselves slowly over decades . 
  europe want through a perhaps the most violent war in human history before reaching the period of peace and prosperity that you 've experienced for the better part of the last century . 
  it seems short sighted to de-cry the `` perpetual violence '' of the me and the necessity of dictatorships to maintain order . 
  especially when one considers the recent history of europe for example . 
  so does the us . 
  no , it is n't . 
  unless russia outright ** nukes turkey ** which i 'm am going to assume for now will not happen . 
  turkey has more than the military capacity to ** defend itself ** from russian aggression . 
  let me say that again since for some reason people seem to be unable to grasp the concept of logistics or the defensive advantage . 
  ** on its own turf ** , turkey has the more than enough military capacity to defend itself against any russian incursion with or without nato support . 
  in anything resembling a realistic analysis of the question russia does not have the military capacity to defeat turkey in an offensive war , even if turkey could not call on nato support . 
  turkey ** also ** obviously does n't have the military capacity to invade or defeat russia . 
  power projection and invasion especially over long distances or across large bodies of water is one of the most difficult and expensive things to do . 
  to do this you must be ** much ** ** much ** ** much ** more powerful than your enemy . 
  the power differential between turkey and russia is not nearly great enough to give either of them the ability to defeat the other in an offensive war . 
  unless of course russia were willing to resort to the use of nuclear weapons , which i assume they are not . 
  over and over again i 've been explaining to you that this is a question a ** defensive conflict ** . 
  russia is not going to suddenly ramp up production of 500 new fighter jets , because they ca n't afford it . 
  if russia and turkey fought a war ** today ** and turkey was the defensive party , as the current conflict would imply . 
  russia could not defeat or even seriously harm turkey , and any attack would probably result in greater russian losses than turkish losses . 
  in a theoretical long conflict between russia and turkey with no outside involvement russia could probably win through greater industrial capacity and access to raw materials . 
  but such a conflict is not just improbable but outright impossible . 
  if there were a war ** today ** as a result of an event like this and turkey could not turn to nato , they could handily defend themselves without much difficulty . 
  that is all i 'm going to say on this issue . 
   do you understand the concept of having a military industrial machine . 
   russia would roll over ** turkey ** while they wait for ** lockheed ** martin to service their planes . 
   that 's what it would come down to ahh i see their strategy would be to `` just roll over them '' . 
  kind of like the ussr just `` rolled over '' finland during the winter war ? 
  kind of like nazi germany just `` rolled over '' great britain during wwii at the height of their power ? 
  you do n't have a clue what you 're talking about . 
  you do n't just `` roll over '' large , extremely well armed , advanced military just because you happen to be russia . 
  the f-16 is an extremely reliable aircraft that has been flying for 4 decades . 
  the turkish ground crews are trained to service and arm them as needed , and they probably have support from lm on the ground at all times . 
  `` we 'll roll over them '' is not a strategy , now go home and shut the fuck up . 
  greece is not russia , turkey is not russia , turkey and greece are nato allies . 
  turkey has every right to respond to armed incursions into its airspace in the way it sees fit . 
  well i tend to base my analysis on the assumption that russia does n't want to put an end to the world . 
  if they do that none of this shit matters anymore , i 'm just assuming they would rather not turn turkey into glass and deal with all the consequences of that ... 
  turkey is opposed to the regime , some people who are opposed to the regime have links to isis . 
  russia is in favor of the regime , it has engaged with forces who are isis related and in many cases forces who are opposed to isis and also opposed the regime . 
  russia has launched some 2500 air strikes in the last month , the united states has launched some 44,000 air strikes over the last 10 months . 
  and those attacks have actually been more or less exclusively targeted at isis and affiliated forces as opposed to regime opposed rebels who do not support and often actively oppose isis . 
  the assad regime has murder more than a quarter million of its own people , and i do not see them as a shining beacon of light who deserves my support . 
  just because they 're willing to skull fuck islamists does n't mean they 've got my support , after all they also like to skull fuck artists , journalists and programmers . 
  russia needs to stop fucking around in other nations air space , and in other nations sovereign territory . 
  just because paris happened and putin mailed the french a new puppy does n't make russia our new friend . 
  after they spent the last year invading european nations and causing a general fuck fest across the continent .
