  because if putin wants to talk about the `` nefarious , back stabbing , turks '' then perhaps we should consider the question with some context . 
  which is russian or russian backed and supplied rebels , have shot down civilian airliners making a legal airspace crossing , with no warning . 
  and then spent several months trying to claim they did n't do it , or an alien did it , or a ukranian su-27 did . 
  while armed russian bombers , twice violated turkish airspace , with prior warning to wave off , after months of escalating warnings on the infractions . 
  and were then shot down . 
  so when we 're making an argument about `` 17 seconds '' like the relatively short period is somehow deeply significant . 
  i think we should consider russia 's own stance on air space interdiction . 
  this was an armed , military jet , violating another nations sovereign air space , was warned , and was duly fired upon . 
  crimea fucking river . 
  you 've got to be kidding russia has been operating for about a month during this conflict . 
  they 've flown a little over 2500 missions . 
  by contrast the united states has been operating for over 10 months and flow about 44,000 missions . 
  oh wait but i forgot `` russia stronk , do n't fuck with the russians , uh oh the russians are coming , you done fucked up now '' . 
  the russians may not have many airplanes , or be launching many attacks but i will say they seem to be holding up their end of the pr game . 
  i 'm sure they 'll have no problem with the large , well trained , well equipped turkish air force . 
   since when 4:1 is an equal fight ? 
  do you understand the concept of logistics ? 
  just because russia has airplanes and weapons does n't mean they can bring the bear on the enemy . 
  especially when that enemy is across a small sea and shares no land border with russia . 
  for russia to attack turkey it much launch its planes presumably from russia , since bases in syria would be vulnerable to cruise missile as well as air and potentially ground attack from turkey . 
  then it must fly those aircraft to turkey , refueling ** multiple times ** along the way . 
  as they near the engagement zone they will be spotted by high powered ground based turkish radar systems which will give advanced warning . 
  turkish aircraft with full missile load outs and full fuel tanks will launch and engage whatever size of force russia can send . 
  this would mean that the russians would be ** locally ** outnumbered . 
  regardless of the full size of the russian fighter fleet they can not bring anything like that number of aircraft to bare on a target which is far away . 
  during the engagement they will be outnumbered by turkish jets that have n't flown across an ocean in order to enter an engagement . 
  they will be at an informational disadvantage as ground based turkish radars communicate to turkish pilots their locations and disposition . 
  finally they will also be contending with turkish aa systems . 
  after the engagement russian fighters will be out of missiles and running low on fuel . 
  while there will likely be fresh turkish fighters ready to engage the fleeing and now un-armed russian fighters . 
  if those fighters want to get home they 'll need to rendezvous with refueling aircraft . 
  aircraft which will be vulnerable to the inbound turkish counter attack . 
  the defender advantage is a big fucking deal , there is a reason the united states spends just ungodly amounts of money on aircraft carriers . 
  because without them it is damned near impossible to project air power more than a few hundred kilometers from an air base . 
  if russia and turkey were neighbors and they got into a head on slug fest , yes russia would wipe the floor with them . 
  but in any conflict where russia is the aggressor and turkey is in a ** defensive role ** turkey has more than the military capacity to defend itself from any realistically probable russian attack . 
  turkey has more than 200 fighters many of which are generation 4 + , armed with current generation a2a missiles . 
  they have advanced awacs and a large fleet of modern aerial refueling aircraft . 
  they also have one of the most advanced radar networks in the world . 
  their pilot training is equal or better than what russians receive . 
  they 've got a million man army . 
  on their own territory in a defensive war , turkey could ** absolutely ** hold its own against russia , with or without nato support . 
   less reddit more reading . 
  ha , maybe you need less reddit , you seem to have adopted the . 
  `` do n't poke the bear '' `` russia stronk '' `` omg they fucked with the russians '' meme ... 
  sweden is n't a nato member period , there is no method to eject a country from nato , turkey occupies one is probably one of the top five most strategically important parts of the planet . 
  they will not be removed from nato . 
   i do n't like how they act but the last thing we need is a war . 
  [ better red then dead eh ? 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/jdvt-8tufie ) . 
  after multiple warnings that they were approaching the airspace and they chose not to wave off . 
  yeah pretty clearly intentional . 
  oh right and they did it twice ... 
  if you have reasonable grounds to consider that person a threat , you warn them that you are armed and you will retaliate , and that person continues to advance and behave in a threatening manner . 
  then , in the us at least , you 're pretty well justified , and almost certainly wo n't go to jail . 
  though it varies a bit from state to state . 
  russia was n't taking a pleasure blimp across the border , they were flying armed jet fighters . 
  they were warned , they ignored the warning , they were put down . 
  hell you can shoot a cop : http://thefreethoughtproject.com/man-shot-cops-no-knock-raid-acquitted-charges/ and get away with it if you had reason to believe your life was in danger , and you 're white . 
  oh no , are you not going to give me a gold star , whatever shall i tell daddy . 
   there is no reason to allow this to escalate - economic sanctions can do enough . 
  economic sanctions can not stop escalation unless the party being sanctioned chooses not to escalate . 
  you can tell a kid they 'll lose their favorite toy if they hit their sister , but at the end of the day you 've got no guarantees they still wo n't hit their sister . 
  you can not control people from the outside , you can encourage them to act in one way or discourage them from acting in another . 
  but at the end of the day it comes down to a decision and that decision can not be dictated from the outside . 
   civil discourse . 
  and i told papa that those cambridge boys are really quite trashy , nothing like the refinement of the lads over at oxford . 
  of course its an exaggeration , this is reddit the home of hyperbole , if i were looking for reasonable and rationale responses i would look elsewhere . 
  russia is n't a terrorist state though it has ties to groups who could be defined as terrorists . 
  turkey is n't a terrorist state , though it has ties to groups who could be defined as terrorists . 
  neither turkey or greece is obligated to respond violently to an incursion into their airspace . 
  they do technically have the right but as allies they do n't actually have the desire . 
  a turkish aircraft crossing into syrian airspace was recently shot down , very probably by russian equipment manned by russian personnel . 
  russia and turkey have a different relationship than turkey and greece . 
  i can slap my friend in the back of the head and he 'll laugh it off . 
  if i slap a stranger or an co-worker the reaction is likely to be very different . 
  turkey is not obligated to defend its airspace to the max , but it is an option should they choose to . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o_5uk2ykky look !, 
  the russians are n't invading . 
   ( they defended a country they recognise ) and the turks are acting in defense of a people they recognize and support as their own . 
  did turkey violate russian airspace ? 
  well if greece ** really ** wants turkey to stop i guess they should shoot them . 
  at the end of the day it 's a situation of ** choice ** turkey and greek have a certain relationship . 
  while they poke and prod each other they ** choose ** not to escalate . 
  turkey told russia , stop doing this , we take it seriously , we will respond . 
  and then after russia ignored them they ** choose ** to respond . 
  and they were within their rights to do so . 
  turkey is not obligated to respond in the same manner to every incursion , or every nationality , they have the right to choose how they respond based on many factors . 
  they choose to shoot this russian jet down , and they were within their rights to do so . 
  turks or rebels ? 
  i thought the plane and pilots ended up coming down in syria . 
   they shot down one and turkey screamed to high heavens . 
  and i doubt it made the front page of reddit ? 
   turkish plane that would also be legal , would it not ? 
  yep , if russia is given authorization by the syrian government to enforce its airspace . 
  and turkey violates that airspace without permission . 
  of course if the turkish jets are fired upon they will probably respond as well . 
  they could but since greece and turkey are actually allies if tense allies that would be a bit weird . 
  why are you all obsessed with absolutism , instead of understanding that situations and relationships are variable things . 
  russia has violated turkish airspace multiple times , turkey has made it very clearly that they ** do not ** view this in the same light as say greek incursions .
