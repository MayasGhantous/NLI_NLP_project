  they warned the russians multiple times , the russians crossed the line , they got shot . 
  nothing more nothing less . 
  do n't start shit you are n't prepared to finishing , russia wants to act tough by ignoring the wishes of other nations with impunity . 
  it seems that they took their little tough guy game a bit too far , and lost an airplane and some pilots . 
   the totalitarian political ideology of islamism is the primary enemy and challenge humanity must overcome in our time , just like the totalitarian political ideolog\u00edes of fascism and leninism were in the last century . 
  and it shall be overcome by totalitarianism eh ? 
   totalitarian political ideologies are never moderate , they always pull to the ultimate . 
  i am glad that in the end the delusional `` moderate nazi '' narrative was overcome , just like today the delusional `` moderate islamist '' narrative is in terminal decline . 
  i agree , i just happen to know that assad is a totalitarian dictator . 
  i 'm not 100 % certain of the motivations of all the various factions opposing him . 
  i think some are probably totalitarian religious fundamentalists . 
  i think some of them are probably angry at a dictatorial regime that has been murdering and suppressing its own people for decades . 
  you seem to think i 'm defending the moral principal of airspace , i 'm not . 
  i 'm saying that if you fuck around with someone who has warned you to stay out , you might get shot . 
  that 's it . 
  i do n't have to agree with turkey 's behavior , but it 's a simple fact that airspace is a real thing enforced by many nations . 
  turkey has repeatedly warned russia to cut the shit , russia chose not to listen because they did n't think anyone had the balls to shoot them down . 
  they were wrong . 
  if the syrians can shoot down a turkish jet in their air space that is their right of course . 
  turkey would n't have any trouble holding its own against the russians with or without nato . 
  and last time i checked it was russia that started the poking . 
  more like poke the turk but do n't be surprised if they poke back eh ? 
  they warned them prior to the incursion . 
  if i say `` do n't take one more step or i 'll shoot '' and you take one more step , well , you were warned . 
  oh right it 's turkey that invaded ukraine and georgia . 
  we get it , you do n't like muslims , invading your neighbors is fine so long as they 're your christian neighbors . 
  17 seconds in a jet aircraft is not some minor incursion but a clear and intentional violation of airspace . 
  they were warned not to cross the line , they crossed the line , they got shot . 
  that 's really all there is to it . 
  more warning than mh17 ever got . 
  fighting a government that has killed a quarter million of its own people . 
  during wwii the allies were aligned with the ussr which a few months ago murdered some 10 million ukrainians and invaded poland and finland . 
  necessity makes strange bedfellows , only those who are lying in bed and surfing reddit on their phones can afford to stand on solely on principal . 
  russia is n't going to kill them unless they 're prepared to invade syria , which they are n't . 
  neither are france or the uk , everyone wants to talk tough about isis nobody wants to pay the price in blood and treasure to actually put an end to the situation . 
  wars are not won from the air , and this is n't a war , it 's just a little interdiction against some folks we do n't care for . 
  in a region where nobody really intends to stop them . 
   and to directly answer your question : of course i would prefer assad 's brutal secular dictatorship to the naked barbarism of islamists for syria any day . 
  any decent human being should . 
  right because the guy who executes journalists / programmers / artists and more than a quarter million of his own people is clearly preferential to anyone else . 
  please , you people are just hysterical about the threat of islamism which is n't nearly the issue you make it out to be . 
  the middle east is fucked up , you 've got dictators , and religious extremists , then there are religious people who are also fairly secular , various groups that want sovereignty , and on and on . 
  it 's asinine to try to boil down every conflict into good guys , bad guys , and dictators . 
  you and a significant majority of people just do n't want to deal with the fact that the world is n't simple sometimes . 
  so you paint everyone with any connection to islamism as the literal devil and say that any barbarism is acceptable to remove them . 
   the islamists , are the ultimate and mortal antagonist and enemy to our values of enlightenment and humanism , ** to individual liberty , emancipation and freedom , to progress and the open society ** . 
  and to defeat them i will install a dictator to destroy all of these things , ahh hypocrisy tastes sweet in the morning . 
  insightful . 
  do n't fuck around if you do n't want a bloody nose . 
  if someone cuts you in line punching them in the face is n't a proportional response , but that does n't mean they do n't deserve it . 
  if you antagonize others , do n't be surprised when they respond . 
  i think they did it because russia likes to push its boundaries and they decided to push back . 
  turkey does n't need nato backing to stick up to russia , they needed it to stick up to the ussr , but they 're more than capable of holding their own against the russians with or without nato . 
  all russia had to do was not be there , that 's the long and the short of it . 
  did the attack on pearl harbor warrant two nuclear weapons being dropped on japanese cities ? 
  probably not if your concern is proportional response , but our concern and perhaps the concern of the turks was to show that they did not intend to be fucked with . 
  probably not all of them , and who is going to kill them exactly ? 
  the army of the eu ? 
  yes , all russia wants to do is protect the west by killing islamic terrorists , noble russia has no interests of its own in the region totally un-related to terrorism . 
  so what you 're saying is that a strong armed dictator is an acceptable compromise so long as they 're getting rid of people you do n't like . 
  got it . 
  they are n't ** all ** al nusra , probably some of them have links to al nusra . 
  that does n't mean that turkey wants the russians carpet bombing the region . 
  especially when reports from the ground have stated that russian strikes in syria have been ** particularly ** inaccurate and un-surgical . 
  turkey does n't want russia fucking around with people it sees as its own . 
  and when russia literally stepped over the line turkey took its chance and responded . 
  jeez people say americans are obsessed with defining one side as good and the other side as bad . 
  we 'll see , turkey has an advanced , well trained , and well equipped air force . 
  my bet is that russia gives an angry speech and then learns a little respect for turkish sovereignty . 
  in short , do n't fuck around if you are n't prepared to accept the consequences . 
  we fly into syrian airspace and we are prepared to respond to an attack on our aircraft should such an attack occur . 
  the syrian government do n't shoot at american jets , because they are n't prepared to accept the consequences . 
  russia should n't invade turkish airspace if they are n't willing to accept the potential consequences . 
  do n't fuck around if you ca n't deal with the consequences . 
  seems like a good bet . 
  nato is n't a cutesy wootsie fan club for erasmus students , who want to talk international ethics from the comfort of their parents couch . 
  it 's a ** military alliance ** , have a quick look at a map , zoom in on istanbul , tell me where it sits . 
  turkey is not going to be removed from nato do n't be ridiculous . 
  the turkmen are a turkic people , and it seems that turkey was n't particularly happy about the attacks in the region . 
  they already wanted russia to desist , and russia was well aware of this . 
  they put a toe over the line and turkey cut it off . 
  if you 're already doing something counter to the stated interests of another nation you would do well not push your luck any further then necessary . 
  russia pushed its luck , they got a response . 
  cute , since russia has literally invaded an annexed portions of ** multiple ** nations over the last few years . 
  while claiming that they actually are n't , do n't imagine that people do n't take incursions into their territory seriously . 
  this is n't a game , i 've got no interest in war , but the russian leadership seems that they can continually up the ante without response . 
  this is n't the case , respect the sovereignty of other nations , and if you do n't want to , do n't be surprised when they respond aggressively . 
  russia also knows its a war zone , they 've been warned off multiple times to not fuck around , all they had to do is stay out of the airspace and acknowledge that other players are not keen to be tested . 
  this was n't an accident , russia pushes boundaries , attempts to illicit a response , shows that no response is forthcoming . 
  if you 're constantly pushing boundaries do n't be surprised when get a response . 
  aircraft crossed turkish airspace . 
  turkey does n't have f-22 's they 've got a lot of battle tested , extremely reliable equipment , very well trained pilots and ground crews . 
  the point i 'm making is n't state of the art vs. not state of the art . 
  rather that turkey more than russia accepts its position as a middling power and invests accordingly . 
  russia as an ex-super power attempts convey an image of extreme competence that is n't actually there . 
  turkey is very good , russia tries to convey an image of extraordinary , and as a result they are often less than good . 
  it 's better to hit 95 % of targets at 500m then to spend a ton of time trying to hit targets at 1500m missing 95 % and ** then ** only hitting targets at 500m 60 % of the time ? 
  do you get my drift , being average an consistent is better than attempting to be great , and only hitting that mark occasionally . 
  arm chair generals are upset with `` furthest , fastest , biggest '' when what is more important is good enough . 
  in other words people and by extension their nations have differing relationships with each other .
