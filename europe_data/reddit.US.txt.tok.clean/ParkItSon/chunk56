  turkey and greece are essentially two people who are in the same friend group , that do n't really like each other . 
  they act some what antagonistically towards each other , push each others buttons . 
  but being in the same friend group they know where to draw the line . 
  russia by contrast is not in the group , but has a bad habit of pushing the boundaries past where others are willing to accept . 
  russia wants to imagine that it can behave in a deliberately antagonistic manner and that a response will be tempered by what amounts to manners and a desire to not cause an incident . 
  and when other nations tell them to fuck off , and back down , they seem incapable of recognizing that the other party ** is serious ** . 
  russia had clear warnings over weeks to fuck off , they did n't , they put a toe over the line , the toe got cut off . 
  the obvious difference being that the us was operating within what is generally recognized as international law and standards to demonstrate a commitment to those standards . 
  russia on the other hand has a long history of violating international law and standards to show that it can , and to dare others to respond to them . 
  on a human level russia is the guy who cuts in front of you in line , and when you call them out they say `` well do you want to fight me over it ? '' . 
  expecting you to back down because you do n't want to have a fight over what is a very minor issue . 
  but if you 're provoking people , and acting in a deliberately antagonistic manner , you really should n't be surprised when someone pops you in the jaw one day . 
  russia relies on the desire of people to accept small insults rather than escalating the situation . 
  but you never know when somebody is n't going to let that small insult pass . 
  i have a feeling that russian jets will steer clear of turkish airspace in the future . 
  this trope really needs to die , the russians are not some sort of ubermensch of war . 
  in fact russian equipment and technology is decidedly second or even third rate , in the ** real ** and meaningful sense of the word . 
  the announced capabilities of russia 's weapons are very often exaggerated , un-reliable , and or ruinously expensive . 
  does nobody stop to wonder why russia is always releasing some next generation of missile / or sam system ? 
  while the united states with all its vast resources and military spending mostly uses updated versions of the same equipment it has been using for ** decades ** . 
  the reason is because instead of always releasing some crowd pleasing next generation `` super advanced '' system they 've spent a lot of time and money perfecting boring shit . 
  the aim-9 and the amraam have been the a2a missiles of choice for decades . 
  and during that time we 've gotten really really good at making them work very well , because the focus has been on getting the boring but important stuff right . 
  same with aircraft like the f-16 which have been in production for more than 40 years . 
  instead of always producing something cool and `` next generation '' they 've instead refined a good existing plane to be very good and very functional . 
  the end result of all of this is that the west and nato members have an extremely well developed , well trained , well armed , and perhaps most importantly ** exhaustively tested ** set of equipment . 
  what russia mostly has is a lot of theoretical weapons , with good pr firms , and worrying wikipedia specifications that do n't necessarily match up at all with real life applicability . 
  if russia wants to have a little air war with turkey , my money is very firmly on turkey . 
   those two statements are contradictory as the latter is a prediction . 
  i guess we 're just going to argue semantics . 
  but probabilistic analysis and prediction are not the same thing in my eyes at least . 
  you can make a probabilistic statement without that statement being predictive . 
  you have a 50 % of flipping a coin and coming up heads . 
  that is a probabilistic statement , not a predilection . 
  you could even calculate the odds of flipping a coin five times and each time coming up heads , but just because you can show a probability does n't mean you can predict . 
  you can say `` the odds of flipping a coin 100 times and getting heads 100 times is ** exceptionally ** low '' but you have no way of predicting when you will land on tails . 
  we can make predictions about weather because we understand enough about the factors which cause weather to generate several probability analysis and choose the one that is most likely . 
  but that ability with earthquakes really just is n't there , we have many theories that ** might ** help people to predict earthquakes , but as of yet we do n't have evidence to show that these predictive tools are better than statistical noise . 
  after shocks the most predictable of earthquakes are just a decaying probability curve . 
  like flipping a coin and getting and predicting a particular result . 
  getting heads once , 50 % , twice 25 % , thrice 12.5 % , four times 6.25 % ... and on . 
  but we have no way of knowing when in that curve the aftershock quake will occur , just a decaying probability that with time the quakes become less probable . 
   are you a geoscientist ? 
  you are continuing to exaggerate . 
  nope but i can read the official opinion of geologists , and the geological community . 
  http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/education/faqs/faq19.html  ** all attempts to predict earthquakes have , however , been generally considered as failures and it is unlikely that accurate prediction will occur in the near future ** . 
  efforts will , instead , be channelled into hazard mitigation . 
  ** earthquakes are difficult or impossible to predict because of their inherent random element and their near-chaotic behaviour ** . 
  http://www.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9830/3278  neither the usgs nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake . 
  ** they do not know how , and they do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future . 
  ** however based on scientific data , probabilities can be calculated for potential future earthquakes . 
  for example , scientists estimate that over the next 30 years the probability of a major eq occurring in the san francisco bay area is 67 % and 60 % in southern california.the usgs focuses their efforts on the long-term mitigation of earthquake hazards by helping to improve the safety of structures , rather than by trying to accomplish short-term predictions . 
  the official position of the scientific community is that they have a lot of ideas about what ** might ** cause an event . 
  they can look at characteristics and make an estimate of probabilities over a very long time scale . 
  there is nothing they can do to predict earthquakes in a manner which is relevant to short term human decisions . 
  if you 're planning to build a new city , as a seismologist . 
  if you 're deciding weather or not to stay outside of your house for a few days  i would debate this statement , as it is still a valid field of debate among seismologists , but i said aftershocks which most certainly are predictable using omori 's law and bath 's law . 
  there 's a difference between a probability curve and a prediction . 
  since we 're talking about weather , that is a prediction you are able to look at factors and say i predict this , will happen at this time . 
  you do n't say `` i know it rains 120 days a year on average , so i predict it will rain on wednesday '' . 
  you say it rains 120 days a year so there is a 1/3 chance it will rain on wednesday , but that is not a prediction . 
  you ca n't predict aftershocks , you can show statistically that it is likely that they will happen but there is no way to predict the event ( s ) . 
  source . 
   this is false , or at least an exaggeration of the current scientific ignorance . 
  no , it really is n't . 
   it is impossible to predict earthquakes with a high degree of precision ( days/weeks ) yes , or within months or years . 
  the best you can do is say that historically speaking n number of earthquakes , of i intensity , over a given p period . 
  there is no way of knowing ** at all ** when it that period a quake is likely to occur . 
  since we 're talking about the l'aquila quake lets look at some brilliant predictions prior to the quake , and the basis for those predictions . 
   on 27 march giuliani warned the mayor of l'aquila there could be an earthquake within 24 hours , and an earthquake m ~ 2.3 occurred . 
  [ 156 ] on 29 march he made a second prediction . 
  [ 157 ] he telephoned the mayor of the town of sulmona , about 55 kilometers southeast of l'aquila , to expect a `` damaging '' -- or even `` catastrophic '' -- earthquake within 6 to 24 hours . 
  loudspeaker vans were used to warn the inhabitants of sulmona to evacuate , with consequential panic . 
  no quake ensued and giuliano was cited for inciting public alarm and injoined from making public predictions . 
  [ 158 ]  after the l'aquila event giuliani claimed that ** he had found alarming rises in radon levels ** just hours before . 
  [ 159 ] he said he had warned relatives , friends and colleagues on the evening before the earthquake hit , [ 160 ] ** he was subsequently interviewed by the international commission on earthquake forecasting for civil protection , which found that there had been no valid prediction of the mainshock before its occurrence . 
  [ 161 ] ** fore shocks have not been shown to be statistically predictive of the probability of earthquakes . 
  most of the theoretically predictive factors for earthquakes have been shown to be statistically insignificant upon further evaluation . 
  and there are reasons to believe that due to the very nature of the earth as a [ dynamic geographical system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-organized_criticality ) it may ** never ** be possible to predict earthquakes at all, 
  it seems that the only person who made such claims was bernardo de bernardinis , who as far as i can tell was n't a scientist but a public servant . 
  he falsely stated that the small tremors were in some way relieving pressure and thus a good thing . 
  the actual scientific statement was that :  they told the public that the chance of danger had n't increased or decreased and they would be safe in their homes which is absolutely correct , tremors are not an indicator or predictor of future large earthquakes . 
  scientists had every right to state that people were as safe in their homes with the understanding that safe means ** as safe as any other time ** . 
  unless you think the scientists should have told the residents leave this region , it is an earthquake zone , and you are ** never ** safe from quakes . 
  but to say that people were at greater risk due to recent tremors would have been dishonest , and irresponsible . 
  because in real life great harm can be caused to people and communities through unwarranted over cautiousness . 
  even bernardo de bernardinis statements , while factually incorrect is not particularly damning . 
  because at the end of the day , if you are n't suggesting that people leave their homes . 
  incorrectly re-assuring them is unlikely to cause harm . 
  foreshocks are not predictive of major earthquakes . 
  there are no known factors which allow scientists to predict the future probability of a major or minor quakes . 
   but ** an earthquake is just like a jammed gun ** , it will fire at some point , and damage will occur . 
  except that an earthquake is ** nothing ** like a jammed gun . 
  i feel this point has n't been adequately explained . 
  1 ) earthquakes can not be predicted 2 ) earthquakes ** can not ** be predicted 3 ) ** earthquakes can not fucking be predicted ** scientists have ** no way ** of predicting if / when / where an earthquake will occur . 
  if l'aquila residents do n't want to risk earthquakes they should move , full stop . 
  but if they ask a scientist `` is there a particular risk of an earthquake in the coming few days / weeks / months '' a scientists should tell you , no there 's no more risk now than at any other time . 
  because ** once again ** scientists can not predict earthquakes . 
  the scientists were right in telling the people not to worry . 
  unless you think that scientists should warn you not to go outside without a helmet because a brick could always fall off a building and land on your head .
