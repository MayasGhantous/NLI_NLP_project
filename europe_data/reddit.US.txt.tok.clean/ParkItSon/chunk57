  the best advice the scientists could give is that you should go home , and if you 're really worried about quakes you should move . 
  the scientists never said a quake is impossible , but they had no grounds to warn anyone , about anything , because they had no way to know , at all , that there was present risk . 
   which was n't a nato member . 
  you 're right it just happens to border four of them . 
  while france may not be one of those border states consider the feelings of those who do . 
  lets draw a parallel , what if russia invaded mexico ? 
  do you think america would be very calm in that situation , i mean it is n't as if they invaded canada , a nato member , they just invaded our more corrupt dysfunctional neighbor , so no big deal right ? 
  russia seeing what they can get away with , they understand that no-one really wants a war with russia . 
  and they do n't want a war with nato , but russia is an more desperate situation , and they 've got less to lose . 
  nato regardless of its strength is an exceptionally fragile construction . 
  it hinges on the belief that americans are willing to lose washington to defend tallinn , a city that most americans do n't know of , in a country most americans think is a fictional [ dilbert creation ] ( http://www.laputan.org/images/pictures/elbonia-900406.gif ) so i find it disturbing that people shrug off the security concerns of border states on the basis of `` because nato '' . 
  nato is words on a page , that demand an un-imaginable sacrifice from people with very little to gain to defend it . 
  this is not something to take lightly . 
  ah the feared s-500 , the hypersonic and stealthy pak-da , the greatest a2a fighter the pak-fa . 
  and i 've heard they might even have unicorns . 
   historical reasons back in yee oldie timee of 2014 , zee empiro de russo didee invade its neighbor . 
  when was the last time germany really got involved in a conflict ? 
  weird that you would interpret it that way , more that just because you understand a language and are exposed to some elements of a culture , does n't necessarily mean you understand the finer points of that culture . 
  i 've heard similar things from expat 's living in the uk ( or vice versa ) . 
  we share a common language , and many cultural similarities , but there is still a lot of nuance that a foreigner ( even one who speaks the language ) does n't grasp . 
  i personally love british comedy , but there are some americans who just plain do n't get it . 
  because we 've been raised with a different concept of comedy , it does n't mean that there 's no crossover , but the differences are still substantial . 
  and i find that interesting . 
  but when you live in an environment everyday , that culture is defined ( in your head ) as `` normal '' and it 's hard to understand that there are complexities and nuances that are n't necessarily universal . 
  i 'm not sure if culture shock is the word , but dating a european has been interesting because it has caused me to realize how distinctive american culture is . 
  american culture is so globalized that i do n't feel particularly `` foreign '' anywhere . 
  not suggesting that i do n't notice how different things are , but it 's hard to find a place without american music , american products , and american advertising . 
  so its been something of a surprise to realize that non-americans still find america pretty foreign in many ways . 
  even if you speak english perfectly there 's just a lot of jokes / expressions / contextual communication / comedy that is n't always easy for non-americans to grasp . 
  i only really understood this after spending a lot of time with a non-american , newly arrived in this country . 
   hitler , by a freak accident , rode in just before the economy began to pick up pace and could claim the recovery to his politics . 
  he also engaged in something like fdr 's new deal building infrastructure and heavy industry to kickstart demand . 
  interesting , now that you mention it i never really questioned the claim that hitler 's policy 's had a positive impact on the economy . 
  the policies seemed for the most part to be fairly reasonable economic stimulus plan , improving infrastructure , increasing spending , priming the pump . 
  but i never really considered that hitler came into power as the global economy was ( already ) recovering . 
  any good books to recommend on the subject ? 
  [ i am un-tethered and my rage knows no bounds !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnlpgccufny ), 
   come on , as a fellow american we can hardly judge people for that . 
  i 'm not judging them for spying , i 'm judging them for hypocrisy . 
  the german people , and the government made a huge stink about us spying revelations `` friends do n't spy on friends '' etc. 
  indignantly and aggressively claiming the moral high ground . 
  then it turns out that it 's all pretty much bullshit and that germany has been involved in the international spy game as much as everyone else . 
  germany 's image problem is n't that they sometimes do shitty things . 
  it 's that they try to claim moral superiority over just about everyone and then it turns out they 're just as shitty as everyone else . 
  what ? 
  europe is fundamentally connected to asia . 
  in the past the people of the steppes have invaded europe and wreaked massive destruction across the region . 
  that 's very different from the united states which is sheltered to the east and west by two oceans , to the north by the arctic and the tundra , and to the south by the gulf of mexico . 
  if you 're about to say `` what about canada '' , no , canada is a ** functionally ** small and disjointed nation , with the vast majority of the population living a stones throw from the us . 
  and enormously interconnected with the states , to the point that * in the geopolitical sense * canada is basically a friendly vassal state . 
  the only significant land route into the united states is through mexico . 
  a country with an extremely formidable and difficult to cross geography . 
  the united states is in a military sense one of the most isolated countries in the world . 
  you can march and army from eastern asia , into europe , and it has been done . 
  to reach the united states you pretty much need to sail there . 
  they gave them that right when they accepted the euro as their currency . 
   the deal is pretty straightforward : less taxes for individuals , maintenance of higher taxes for big corporations and real wage increase in an attempt to enter an investment cycle and more internal consumption . 
  keynesian measures , broadly speaking . 
  is n't this a plan ? 
  it definitely is . 
  it 's a plan but it 's a plan that does n't make any sense ** unless ** the government either has the cash to pay for it , or is willing to go into debt to pay for it . 
  that is n't a viable strategy when you do n't control your own currency . 
  portugal is deeply in debt , they are dependent on an international community to loan them hard currency in order to service that debt . 
  i 'm not against keynesian measures but they are dependent on europe or at least the eurozone acting together . 
  any small nation is incapable of enacting the measures you 've indicated on their own . 
  the eu 's stance has been ( again and again ) that they will not support or finance these economic stimulus plans . 
  i think that 's pretty dumb , but i 'm not in charge of the ecb , the eu , or the eurozone . 
  so the liberal 's plan is a plan that they can not enact , because they do n't have the cash , or the credit to do so . 
  but , i would have to cross the hudson , ( makes cross against evil ) . 
  what is the plan ? 
  ultimately most small european countries like portugal are already in the situation of basically being a state in a larger nation . 
  it 's a shitty structure because you guys are only half way there . 
  but the liberals basically ca n't do shit without aquiesence from germany which we should have learned after the greek debacle . 
  portugal has 11 million people , they are n't in control of their own situation . 
  that is just a fact , you might not like it but it 's true . 
  so unless the liberals have some sort of brilliant plan other than `` we will force brussels to renegotiate '' , well let 's hear it , because i 've seen that tried and it did n't succeed . 
  the liberals are towing the same line as tsipras , `` we wo n't leave the eu , we wo n't leave the euro , but we will just make things better '' . 
  alright , ** how ? 
  you guys really need to implement a property tax or something , at least on foreigners . 
  i was talking to a portuguese dude the other day who told me that property tax is basically not a thing there . 
  honestly if you make americans pay a moderate property tax they wo n't even notice , they 'll think they 're getting a good deal because we have pretty heavy property taxes here . 
   i wo n't voice my opinion about the left-wing speech , especially the what people are calling the far left-wing , because i 'm not really free of bias but i can tell that we do have a plan and an alternative . 
  the right-wing folks just do n't even try to consider it . 
  well go ahead , how is anyone supposed to know what the plan is if you wo n't articulate it ? 
  seriously . 
  the conservatives are basically saying , `` we 're in a shitty situation , but there is n't a lot we can do , we 'll trim sails and try to ride it out '' . 
  the liberals are ranging from , austerity is bad , we should have less of it , we do n't know how to pay for more social programs but fuck it austerity sucks . 
  also please ignore the previous prime minister who was an out and out crook . 
  to `` fuck the eu , fuck the euro , we 're super fucking pissed off '' . 
  the only people with an actual plan are the conservatives , it is n't a very nice plan because portugal is in a shitty situation , but it is at least what they think they can do . 
  it seems like the voters * basically * accepted this fact , but they felt kind of pissed about it so they voted for some parties they knew would n't win . 
  all the while generally accepting the fact that the conservatives would win and do the unpleasant but necessary shit . 
  but now the liberals have cocked that up and actually taken control , but nobody ** really ** wanted them to be in charge . 
  they just wanted to vote for some nobody party so that they could bitch about the current government without being hypocritical . 
  it 's not that i think it 's rude , i understand that it 's largely about providing a good example for kids who might not know better . 
  it 's just one of those differences in cultural opinions . 
  in america the general rule is mind your own business , it does n't make the other person right , it 's just not your business . 
  in some european countries there is a much stronger attitude of socially enforced behavior / norms . 
  it 's not always a bad thing , it 's just not my thing .
