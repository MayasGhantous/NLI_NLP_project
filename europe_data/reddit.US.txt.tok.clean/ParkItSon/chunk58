  meh , the gun yes , 500lb bomb , not so ineffective . 
  on average , sure , but that 's an average . 
  i would still rather live in parts of africa than in belarus , or russia , or moldova . 
  there was one set of tracks , literally ** one ** , this was n't eurostar , it was the train that runs from village to village in some sleepy little valley barely faster than walking pace . 
  narrow gauge track too . 
  this was n't a rail yard , it was , ** the ** track in the village and the train was stopped . 
  there are some really nice places in africa . 
  it 's a pretty big continent ... 
  but i just finished making the vacationers a [ welcome basket ] ( http://imgur.com/r/murica/yzdsuoh ) :( ... 
  i mean i do n't have a list of names , just experiences . 
  the most notable was in a ** tiny ** village in the austrian albs near zell am see . 
  i crossed at a railroad crossing while the light was red , train was n't moving it was loading passengers . 
  some random dude gave me a lecture about crossing in front of trains . 
  took me a while to figure out what was going on since he was speaking german , and i kept trying to give him directions to the ski area . 
  not a big deal , i get that it 's the custom there ( now ) but honestly the fact that people bother with so many rules / signs / etc. 
  in a village that size , just weird to me . 
  the pastries , the cheeses , they 've got plenty of excellent food that did n't previously swim . 
  i do n't think austrians are unfriendly , i 'm just opposed to people telling me when i can cross the street . 
  mind your own god damned business . 
  american , dating a portuguese , who visits portugal , felt more at home there than anywhere else outside of the states . 
  amazing country , they really need to do a better job marketing how bad ass they are though . 
  nobody knows anything about portugal , despite the fact that they have amazing food , incredible art , a beautiful and varied geography , and a history of kicking ass in the face of overwhelming odds . 
  one of my favorites is the classic . 
  `` barbaric americans , spending so much money on their military when they could be using that money to provide free healthcare and education for americans , like civilized people '' i 'm a liberal person , both socially and in some cases regarding physical and welfare policies . 
  but to claim that spending money on social programs at home for rich americans , versus spending money on the military , is morally superior , is disingenuous . 
  it 's not really morally superior , just self centered . 
  it 's not hard to find a list of recent examples where american military expenditures allowed us to provide aid that mere monetary expenditure would never have allowed . 
  [ operation tomodachi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_tomodachi ) [ operation unified response ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_unified_response ) [ operation unified assistance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_unified_assistance ) are just some recent examples . 
  i 'm not saying that 's all the military does , or that military spending is the same as humanitarian aid . 
  but the fact is after a major disaster , all the swiss bankers donating their money to charity . 
  is worth less than an aircraft carrier ( hospital , power plant , desalination plant , search and rescue airport , logistics base ) which can actually go to a disaster site and ** do things ** . 
  so to preach slashing the military budget in favor of domestic spending as `` humanism '' is n't really considered the implications on a global scale . 
  you mostly pay taxes to assist other germans . 
  i do n't have anything against utilizing a greater degree of social welfare as part of a national model , in some cases i think it makes a lot of sense . 
  but the attitude of moral superiority that some europeans seem to have because their nation subsidizes healthcare / welfare / education , is n't really justified . 
  at the end of the day you 're taxing wealthy people , to help other wealthy people ( when considering the question on a global scale ) . 
   what ? 
  the dutch are very pro-american , germans on the other hand are the complete opposit . 
  and we do n't have an ` attitude of contemptuous superiority ' , you 're confusing us with germany . 
  understand that i 'm not necessarily exposed to a complete cross section of the society . 
  the people i meet are typically young / liberal / globalized , and they very much buy into the belief that we 've passed into some period of post human era . 
   what you and we spend on military is n't enough to finance a welfare state from . 
  with a welfare state we 're talking about spending upwards of 20 % of gdp , not 3,5 % like the us military budget or 0,8 % of gdp like our defense budget . 
  i know , but the people giving the lectures are n't overly concerned with nuanced thinking in this regard . 
  i 'm not opposed to all socialized programs , i think single payer healthcare makes a lot of sense . 
  but saying `` single payer is a good system '' and actually getting there are two different stories . 
  it 's difficult to take a system that 's built on one principal and then to just convert to another , there are a ton of loose ends to tie up . 
  if you want peace , prepare for war . 
  i do n't think russia is going to make an incursion into any nato allies . 
  but in my eyes behaving as if it is very real possibility is the very best way to prevent such an eventuality . 
  we 've been caught on the back foot before because people assumed that russia ( or some other power ) would n't do something . 
  in making preparations for these things you can offer prevent them altogether . 
  in my experience ( i spend a huge amount of time with different europeans in my work ) . 
  easterners are typically extremely pro-american involvement in europe . 
  the baltics , poles , romanians all very pro-american . 
  i 've had estonians basically giving me stump speeches on why the united states should support estonia ( as if i had some direct influence on the decision ) . 
  the southerners are pretty neutral . 
  the uk and the u.s. just one of those partnerships cast in blood , nobody really talks about it but the european attitude towards the states just is n't the attitude of most uk citizens i meet . 
  it 's primarily france , germany , and the lowlanders who have an attitude of contemptuous superiority when it comes to the question of military involvement / martial pursuits in general . 
  it 's primarily people in these countries that almost seem to view the idea of having a military as being almost antiquated . 
  lots of political scientist types who seem to really buy into the belief that the world and human nature has so fundamentally changed as to make these things unnecessary . 
  a typical conversation on the topic might be a brief lecture on why we should have publicly funded health care and education , and that to pay for this we should cut our military spending . 
  what 's a europe ? 
  all of them , but not everywhere , if that makes sense . 
  it 's a big country and the culture of different states and regions are very different . 
  there are americans who are fat as shit , and healthy as shit , smart as shit , dumb as shit , fucking love guns , fucking hate guns . 
  all the stereotypes about america are pretty much true , but at the same time totally false . 
  also the stereotypes are very mixed and matched . 
  if you assume that a red neck , who loves guns , is a dumb / racist / xenophobe you may be wildly mistaken . 
   limits to free speech are so easily abused 100 % agreed  that 's why i think this is good call by the uk authorities but their decision is n't about free speech , it is * apparently * about a shortage of evidence . 
   `` the decision to discontinue these charges has been taken because there is not enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction . '' as a liberal , the thing i hate about liberals is that they 've got fucking thin skin . 
  they 've been the backbone behind `` hate speech '' laws , but if they want these laws they sure as hell better also be responsible for ** their ** speech . 
  if liberals can institute laws that punish people for what they say , and they are not subject to those laws , that is a very dangerous situation . 
  i think content based ( excluding libel / speech aimed at causing immediate harm / etc ) censorship of speech is always , full stop , wrong . 
  because at the end of the day it will always be up to people to decide which content is acceptable and which is n't . 
  liberals need to suffer the consequences of their policies or they wo n't ever understand how fucked up their policies are in the first place . 
  looks like porsche was involved too , any potential ceo 's in the vw group who ** are n't ** responsible for this ? 
  i figured , unless poland has recently started using the us dollar . 
  same in new york . 
  general patton , was however in the business of killing nazis who were doing their damned best to kill him and his men . 
  he probably did n't mean `` if you want to kick the shit out of some random ass pedestrians , you should have a 10 to 1 advantage '' . 
  `` culturally speaking '' but by any sort of sensible analysis or logical thought fish is obviously meat . 
  the literal top comment in this threat is someone blatantly expressing the fact that ** they do n't care ** , but you 're right i 'm probably wrong . 
  is this a joke ? 
  fish feel pain , why in the fuck do people think fish do n't feel pain ? 
  become ? 
  / r/europe ? 
  sorry to burst your bubble but this is n't anything new , this is just europe . 
  the `` socially concerned '' `` liberal bastion '' of europe has always been a facade . 
  europe and europeans ** do n't care ** unless their lives are directly impacted by something ? 
  the balkans , ukraine , georgia , europe does n't care . 
  europeans want comfortable , well ordered lives , in your little countries . 
  europeans could give a flying fuck what happens outside those boundaries so long as their little lives remain comfortable and free of upset and change . 
  the moral liberalism of europe is to be found in textbooks written in european universities , not in the actions of the nations of europe . 
  and the basis for your claims of morality stem more from inaction than anything else , if you do nothing , nothing can go wrong that you will be blamed for . 
  europe does n't care about shit , and it 's nothing new . 
  we do n't have a `` pure democracy '' not many places do so far as i am aware . 
  we have a constitutional representative democracy . 
  there are many reasons for the structure of our democracy . 
  we have certain protections that are * largely * invulnerable to shifts in public opinion , guaranteed by the constitution and protected by the courts .
