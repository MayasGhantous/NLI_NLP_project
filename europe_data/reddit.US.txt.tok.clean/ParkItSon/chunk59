  as we are a union of states consideration is made for the representative power of the states which are not entirely determined by population . 
  all states have equal representation in the senate and population proportional representation in the congress . 
  we do not have a direct democracy , it would n't really make sense here . 
  sorry if that bothers you , but i fail to see what it has to do with something out ambassador said about hungary . 
  ... what , it is democratic , senators who are elected by the people have n't voted to ratify the treaty . 
  which is perfectly democratic regardless of your opinions on the issue . 
  the president ( who is elected democratically ) is the commander and chief of the military , and it has long been his policy to instruct the military to obey these international treaties even if we are not signatories . 
  it might as well be person running from police , trips , hits head , dies , police are to blame for brutality ... 
  person runs from police , escapes , is cooking dinner at home , thinks about police , chokes on broccoli , dies , police brutality . 
  fucking nuts , why were the officers ** even investigated ** for wrong doing in the first place . 
  coolest response here . 
  americans are in no position to claim the moral high ground in regards to * some * people being racist fuckers . 
  what is frustrating is when people say things like `` i 've never seen racism in x , y , z country '' . 
  congratulations , just because you personally have n't seen it does n't mean that it is n't there . 
  i think it 's cool that the head of the air force brought this issue to light . 
  sensible people are n't going to judge all estonians because a few of them are assholes , there are assholes everywhere . 
  and i 'll go one further and say i 'm not keen on blaming people from a 99.9 % white country for being uncomfortable with black people . 
  so much of racism is just discomfort , people feel threatened by things that are different from them . 
  i moved from a city with a large black population , to harlem ny which is a predominantly black population and i felt a little uncomfortable for a few weeks . 
  the people around me had n't done anything to deserve my feelings but they were there , and i was living in a very different environment than i 'd been living in the past . 
  after a few weeks , i got comfortable with my neighborhood and did n't even really notice anymore . 
  so yeah some estonians are racist , and some white americans are racist , and some black americans are racist . 
  acknowledge that the problem exists , do n't ignore it when you see it , and do n't be a dick yourself . 
  basketball games . 
  i did n't say that happened there , but it would n't surprise me in the slightest if people are less than sensitive regarding political correctness and what not . 
  is it that shocking that people might behave towards black people in a way they find insulting ? 
  it is n't even necessarily out of spite , people may just not ** know ** that they 're saying something insensitive or insulting . 
  but always falling back on `` we do n't know what happened '' is a shitty excuse . 
  it 's pretty clear that * something * is happening that is bothering at least some people . 
  and that obviously is n't the fault of the vast majority of estonians , it 's just that it sounds way better to say `` yeah some people can be fucking assholes '' . 
  than to say `` hey hey hey , we really do n't know what happened lets not acknowledge these feelings at all '' . 
   uhhm ... that 's not the only thing they ditch out death sentences for , you know ? 
  i guess it does n't leave you cold when they stone adulterers ? 
  or do you believe they had it coming , too ? 
  wait so i thought europeans were against the whole kicking down the doors and trying to force other countries to follow our laws ? 
  either you think america should be barging around imposing its will on others , or you think other countries should be allowed to do their shit . 
  and if the people really want a change they should hang their leaders and re-write the laws . 
  but for whatever reason it seems that at least * some * of the people in these countries , * want * these laws , after all its hard to stone someone to death if no one is throwing stones . 
  what i 'm saying is that if you * a foreigner * wants to smuggle drugs through dubai . 
  you should know what 's coming , and do n't go whining to uncle sam about `` cruel and unusual punishment '' you are n't in america . 
  i think the me oil states are a bunch of barbarians , but you 'd be * amazed * how easy it is to just ** not ** go there . 
   quite frankly we simply do n't know what really happened . 
  this is basically the cookie cutter response from europeans , when people in europe act racist . 
  `` well we do n't know they were doing that because of racism '' it 's fucking ridiculous , there was a video i think from the uk of people vandalizing a fucking jewish temple , and attacking the people in it . 
  and what did people on here say `` just looks like a bunch of hooligans to me , we do n't ** know ** if they were attacking the temple because there are jews inside '' . 
  is it honestly that fucking hard to call a spade a spade ? 
  europeans are ** a lot ** more willing to spurt off racist shit than most americans are , like it or not . 
  and you can say whatever you want about `` gypsies '' it is n't the fucking point , the point is that in europe it is n't hard to convince random ass strangers to spout off some ignorant shit about some ethnic group or another . 
  and the go to excuse is always `` well you know some of that is true '' . 
  no shit sherlock , do you think urban black people in this country have n't done anything to deserve their stereotypes ? 
  ** of course they have . 
  ** the thing is that lumping everyone into that group just because some people who look the same act shitty sometimes ** is fucking racist ** . 
  do people not understand that you often do n't * see * racism ? 
  nobody is going to argue that racism is n't a problem in the u.s. right ? 
  well what if i told you that i pretty much ** never ** see racism , that is n't because it does n't exist . 
  it 's because it 's something that people tend to express when no one is looking . 
  that 's why there 's a hell of a lot more racism on reddit than in everyday life , anonymity , people tend to hide their shitty behavior . 
   we will put them on trial in our country for you , however . 
  nobody put him on trial for shit , he 's still making movies , you 're just protecting a child rapist . 
  so i guess that 's what it means to be a humanist to you ? 
  the `` evil empire '' was also one of the leaders in trying to reduce international corruption by making it a crime to use bribery in foreign markets . 
  most european countries took decades to follow suite . 
  like it or not the u.s. actually has a quite good history of respecting the laws of other nations , and making an effort not to undermine their laws for us gains . 
   poles should do all in their power to stop you . 
  you grasp that i 'm talking hypothetically right ? 
   if the mission was successful , but the poles found out what people did it , would the us government extradite them to poland ? 
  in my hypothetical scenario , no probably not . 
  because the scenario is based on your principal that the laws of other nations should not be respected . 
   no , i would deem it horrendous violation of poland 's sovereignty and poles should do all in their power to stop you . 
  so in your eyes sovereignty is the only law that really matters eh ? 
  i commit a heinous crime in europe , flee to the united states , and they refuse to extradite because `` sovereignty '' . 
  here 's my policy , you knowingly commit a crime in another country , you 're subject to those laws and i 'm perfectly happy for the united states to ship your ass back . 
  if a country has fucked up laws , then do n't go to that country , and if you do do n't break those laws . 
  do n't be fucking shocked with saudi arabians want to whip your ass for drinking , ** it is n't as if that shit is a secret ** . 
  if you think that 's barbaric ( i do ) do n't go to saudi arabia , do n't given them your money and your business . 
  but if you go , you fucking know what the situation is , so do n't act surprised and affronted when they want to flog you for drinking a beer . 
  if an american citizen commits a crime in some other country , and it is reasonably certain that they will receive a fair trial than that 's all i need . 
  i 'm not in favor of extraditing people who are clearly just being shafted because they 're a foreigner and an easy scapegoat ( see the [ amanda knox ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amanda_knox#investigation ) case for example ) . 
  but that is n't the case with polanski , polanski plead guilty , he sure as hell was n't being treated unfairly or overly harshly ( he after all was out on parole ) . 
  and since he 's fled he 's basically admitted that he did it , but that according to him `` it 's just not a big deal '' . 
  polanski , got a fair trial , polanski confessed , and it 's a fucking shameful miscarriage of justice for european countries to shelter the man , because i guess in france child rape is n't a crime ? 
  and here 's where my hypothetical situation comes back in . 
  if you are not going to respect ** our laws ** , when the defendant is given a fair and honest trial . 
  then why are you expecting us to follow ** your laws ** , why should n't we just barge in , kick down the doors , and do what the fuck we want ? 
  because let me make this very clear , ** we could ** , the reason we do n't is because there is a global system of laws which is dependent on respect for those laws and their principals . 
  and destroying that system for a scumbag like polanski is hardly worth it . 
  that is n't how you spell . 
  `` the french are dicks '', 
   -- us scientists i am a us scientist , and i 'm going to tell you right now political science is n't science . 
  since you do n't seem to care about the laws of other nations , you would deem it acceptable if we infiltrated poland , killed polanksi , and left without being caught i assume ? 
  after all , there is no reason to respect the laws of another country right ? 
  here 's an idea , if you do n't want to be sentenced and punished for a crime in a particular country . 
  ** do not commit the crime in that country ** , if you want to drug and rape people , do it in sweden , and serve swedish prison sentences . 
  i haven plenty of problems with our justice system and i agree that they 're totally ridiculous / over the top / and unnecessarily cruel in many ways . 
  but at the end of the day , if you do n't want to be held to account by the american justice system , it 's really simple to avoid the problem . 
  1 ) do not commit those crimes in the united states . 
  i 'm honestly not even sympathetic of people who are executed in dubai or oman or whatever for smuggling drugs . 
  and i 'm pro-legalization , but if you ca n't take the heat stay the fuck out of the kitchen . 
   we should n't treat russia as a permanent enemy or lock it out of europe . 
  there 's a difference between treating someone as permanent enemy and recognizing that the ** current situation ** is unacceptable .
