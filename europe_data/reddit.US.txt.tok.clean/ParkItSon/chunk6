  `` that sort of thing used to happen but it does n't happen any more '' . 
  it 's like people have divorced themselves from the past , which is n't the same as torturing yourself over the past . 
  but that past is not irrelevant , it is the history of your continent , it is a part of a story that you are living today . 
  and the events that happened flowed from the same stresses that exist today . 
  humanity has not radically changed in 70 years , technology maybe , communication maybe , but not humanity . 
  what happened 70 years ago tells us something about who we are today , because those are our grandparents . 
  they were not monsters , or subhumans , though they may have done atrocious things . 
  they were human like us , and history reached up grabbed them by the throat , and threw them into hell . 
  history has not ended , humanity is still humanity , not monsters , not angels . 
  and events can and will run away with us again , individuals swept along in currents so deep and strong that they can not be shifted by anyone man or woman . 
   what the hell is going on . 
  germanys foreign policy for decades has been to hold back , always go for the compromise , find consesus and tread lightly . 
  you can not be rich , and an exporter , and not generate resentment . 
  you can not be a power and be left alone . 
  welcome to being a major power germany , no matter what you do people will hate you for it . 
  they will hate you when you act , and they will hate you when you fail to act . 
  you can not negotiate or talk your way around this . 
  americans are used to it and we 're kind of ok with it , germany has a darker history . 
  i feel as if germany does n't want much more than to be left alone to make money but it will never happen . 
  you will either be put in a situation where you are forced to fight for what you have ( though not necessarily militarily ) . 
  or you will have to surrender your wealth for solidarity and unity across europe . 
  but you can not be rich while others are poor and ever expect to be left alone , or for people to all like you . 
   war does not announce itself , it creeps up and comes suddenly . 
  exactly , this is what i mean when i say europeans think about the wars more as abstract concepts than as something that relates to their lives . 
  war , and conflict is a part of human nature , it is not something which we can divorce ourselves from no matter how many books on political science you write . 
  there 's a difference between the constant brow beating of germans for being nazis or hitleresque and really coming to some sort of deep understanding about what happened . 
  and applying ones self to making sure that does n't happen again . 
  europe certainly talks about world war ii but you talk about more like a bad dream than a relevant lesson , a practical reality . 
  here 's a response to this comment :  it may be recent , but it 's totally inconceivable it could happen again . 
  and sure , maybe ww2 is n't going to happen again , but that is n't the problem i 'm talking about . 
  i 'm talking about this attitude that seems so prevalent in europe , the attitude that mankind himself has somehow been fundamentally changed . 
  and that the sorts of things which happened in wwii will never be repeated . 
  that nationalism , and ethnicity will never again divide europe , not because europe has fundamentally changed but because you have * willed * yourselves to be different . 
  inequality is now growing between european nations , the migrant crisis effects some but not others , and russia threatens in the east while countries like germany negotiate deals with the russians that may have huge negative impacts on the easterners . 
  there is a difference between banning the swastika , and feeling guilty about what happened , and really learning the lesson . 
  and that lesson ** is not ** that the germans are bad people , it 's that european history is a tense history . 
  the development of nuclear weapons and nato have taken some of the teeth out of the chance for a major european conflict , but they have not totally blunted it . 
  and wars can be fought without bullets and blood . 
  in the past germany grew , and grew strong and wealthy , and that strength threatened its neighbors . 
  tensions grew and finally snapped the germans were insecure and so were their neighbors . 
  and driven by insecurity both sides were drawn into a conflict which destroyed much of europe . 
  today a similar thing is happening , german wealth and exports threaten the rest of europe . 
  while the germans themselves feel put upon , and that their wealth should not be expended to rescue those `` less worthy '' nations within the eu . 
  germany wants to be rich and peaceful but as an nation hugely dependent on foreign markets to sustain their wealth and standards of living this can not be . 
  you can be poor and people will leave you alone . 
  you can not be one of the richest and most powerful countries on earth and expect to sit quietly and make money by selling your goods to the world . 
  my impression of germans is that they want to be left alone , but they will not be , as they become richer and the rest of europe becomes poorer resentment will grow . 
  and as resentment breeds resentment nations will be pulled into conflict with each other . 
  a general european war it will not be , but some war is probable ( though probably not involving major players ) . 
  but conflict will occur and it will further test the already strained european solidarity project . 
  europe can not escape from history or the human condition no matter how badly you may want to . 
  i would advise full federalization or the dissolution of the the union into sovereign states . 
  you can not go half way with this sort of thing . 
  the way things stand certain countries , germany being the most obvious example benefit hugely from eu market and labor access . 
  the table is currently tilted in favor of rich countries ** and ** rich individuals . 
  rich industrialized countries have a sudden new market for their products and services while at the same time gain access to new labor with high skills and relatively low earnings demands . 
  those countries with the most resources can attract the most educated , best trained , most innovative people etc. 
  while those same people ( skilled / educated people ) are also the most able to move to a new area to benefit from the resources of the most developed countries . 
  all of this drains talent , and literal cash from the tax coffers of the already poorer , and less developed countries , further weakening their ability to train new talent or attract outside talent . 
  the current system of intra eu wealth transfers are not nearly robust enough to counteract this effect . 
  the founders of the eu seemed to be under the impression that a quick jolt of cash to perennially poor nations would allow them to go toe to toe with the germans . 
  this of course is not the case , and the founders of the eu never thought it was . 
  it 's just at no stage in the eu process has the political will existed to create a robust system of transfer payments . 
  which is n't surprising transfer payments * suck * but they are absolutely critical to the sort of organization which is the eu . 
  so long as the system as is remains in place the board will remain tilted in favor of the rich countries and the periphery will more and more become a hollowed out shell of its former self . 
  and international inequality within the eu will grow and grow . 
  the eu system was stable during the first decade of the 21st century because that was a period of breakaway bubble driven growth . 
  people do n't mind inequality so long as they themselves feel like they are getting richer . 
  but that decade is over , growth now is liable to be far more stagnant than explosive . 
  and in an environment inequality between the nations will quickly become a major problem ( it already is a major problem and there 's no end in sight ) . 
  this tension will in time tear the eu apart . 
  ironically as imperfect as it is the eu is still probably better for all of the people of europe ( rich and poor ) than a system completely without the eu . 
  but that is n't what people will focus on , they 'll focus on the level of inequality . 
  a pseudo-state like the eu simply can not be stable when unemployment in one eu nation is 5x 's higher than in other eu nations . 
  there needs to be a robust and ** permanent ** system of transfers for the eu to persist . 
  i 'm confused by people who do n't recognize that a war 70 years ago is ** recent history ** not some sort of legend , this is n't thermopylae , this is recent history that is directly relevant to the shape of the modern world . 
  what i find disturbing is the way europeans view ww2 as some sort of inexplicable bad dream which happened but is totally unrelated to modern europe . 
  i find the failure to grasp context and consequences profoundly disturbing . 
  seriously ? 
  this is basic economics , rich western countries are paying doctors / nurses a lot more than eastern countries . 
  doctors from the east who are able to get jobs in the west are presumably the best trained / most qualified members of the profession . 
  if they 're leaving for better jobs in germany that leaves the * relatively * poor doctors for the eastern bloc . 
  if there is enough demand for medical professionals in the west it is perfectly conceivable that eastern countries are going to run up against shortages of medical professionals . 
  then they 'll need to pay to train more of them and once they 're done the best and brightest may just leave for the west . 
  the eastern bloc countries with far less money are n't going to be able to attract a meaningful number of professionals from the west . 
  germany is well aware of this problem , my best friend is german , he 's trying to get his md in germany ( free education ) . 
  but he wants to live and work in the states , ( better pay , and he 's lived here too long to feel at home in germany ) . 
  germany of course does n't want him to have dual citizenship for ** exactly ** this reason . 
  the eastern bloc countries are in the same position here as germany is with the united states . 
  the difference is that germany can to a degree compete on pay / benefits with the states . 
  and they can use other tools like restrictions on citizenship to keep their home educated doctors at home . 
  the eastern bloc ca n't compete on salary , and they ca n't restrict the movement of their home trained doctors . 
  the end result is that germany gets pick of the litter for medical professionals while dodging the cost of educating them . 
  there 's a difference between thought crimes and a planned but thwarted assassination attempt ? 
  in your eyes are we under legal obligation to allow the crime before we can do anything about the perpetrator ? 
  in my eyes there 's a blurred line between 2nd degree and voluntary manslaughter . 
  voluntary manslaughter would theoretically be a situation where the perpetrator says `` i have no idea what happened , everything went red and she was dead '' . 
  while 2nd degree would be someone who in the moment * wanted * to kill someone , and then did so , but perhaps with a bit more thought they 'd have realized how bad of an idea that was . 
  but a person who commits first degree murder has a plan , to kill someone , and they go about orchestrating that plan . 
  to me that shows a mindset which is difficult , near impossible , to cure .
