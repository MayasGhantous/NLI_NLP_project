  there was an invasion of a european country , ** last year ** , there is a still active conflict in europe right now . 
  the government which initiated that conflict is still in power , and they have shown no interest in moderating their ambitions or behaviors . 
   to entice russia out of its shell and to show them they can trust us . 
  russia invaded its neighbors and its the west that needs to `` entice them out of its shell '' are you fucking kidding me ?!, 
  like maybe if we give them estonia they 'll feel enticed enough to interact with the rest of the world ? 
  this is appeasement , plain and simple . 
  1 ) because the loss is extremely gradual 2 ) because as i said above , a little predictable loss is often more appealing than the risk of massive unexpected losses . 
  investing is hard , you need to ** a lot ** of research to make an investment and even then you can be very wrong and all of your money can disappear overnight . 
  3 ) you do n't have to keep a treasury bond for the entire life of the bond . 
  you can pretty much always sell it to someone else if you 'd like more liquid currency to invest somewhere more productive . 
  do you keep some of your money in a bank or a checking account ? 
  well then odds are you 're losing money as well , because the money being paid out in interest these days is less than the inflation rate . 
  the reason people still keep money in banks though is that they want it to be around , safe , and available to use . 
  and if that means losing a few cents to inflation , that 's acceptable to most people . 
  if you 've got a trillion dollars you ca n't put it in the bank , but you can buy us treasury bonds . 
  they are n't a good investment , they 're a good place to leave your money if you do n't know what else to do with it . 
  they will continue to be a good investment so long as the united states continues to exist . 
  so you 're assuming that the united states will in essence stop being the global power in the near future , i assume . 
   makes you wonder why people continue to lend us money if they 're getting paid back significantly less then what they lent . 
  christ i said i would n't do this but since this one is so easy and there 's just a chance you might pay attention i 'll explain . 
  if you have a lot of money , ** a lot ** of money , like a trillion dollars where to put that money becomes a very serious problem . 
  i imagine that when you get your paycheck you probably put that money in the bank right ? 
  maybe a percentage of it goes into your 401k as an investment / savings but most of it goes in the bank . 
  from there you might do any number of things with it , buy stocks , buy a house , put it in a savings account to earn a little interest . 
  most critically you want the money to still be there when you go looking for it at some point future . 
  for a normal person this is pretty easy , you can put the money in a government insured savings account and its safe up to about 100k . 
  if you 've got a trillion dollars this is a considerably larger problem . 
  the problem is just where in the hell are you going to put that money ? 
  you could buy companies with it , but how do you know which companies are worth buying , same with houses , stocks , really any asset . 
  you could put all the money in a hedge fund but bernie madoff should show you that you ca n't always trust them . 
  basically finding a place to put a trillion dollars is a ton of work in and of itself , and wherever you put it you 've got to worry that its disappearing . 
  but probably the simplest , easiest , and safest places to put your money is in us treasury bonds . 
  in other words , you give your money to the united states government to take care of . 
  the us government does n't pay much in interest , so that kind of sucks , but hey , at least you can be confident that the money will be there so long as the united states is , and in this world there are few safer bets than that . 
  and of course you do n't need to keep the money there forever , because us bonds are so safe , and stable , you can pretty much always sell them for whatever you paid . 
  tldr : the reason people are willing to lend the us government a lot of money at very very low rates . 
  is because when you have a lot of money , the problem of finding a safe place to keep it becomes very difficult . 
  probably the easiest and safest place to keep that money is with the the us government . 
  you might not get much return , you may even lose some to inflation over time . 
  but compared to pretty much anywhere else it 's a safe , simple , secure place to put cash , and loses are minimal and predictable . 
   it should . 
  it faces the same economic constraints as any other entity . 
  the only difference is scale . 
  dude i 'm done with you since you clearly do n't have even the most rudimentary understanding of economics or fiscal policy . 
  a government is not like `` any other entity '' because a government and or / a nation ** is fucking immortal ** . 
  people do n't offer normal human beings super long term debt , even the 30 year mortgage is dependent on government backing . 
  but people ** do ** offer governments , particularly the us government debt on an ** extremely ** long time table , at very low interest . 
  ** because ** a government , is not a person , or a company , literally nothing short of national collapse will bring about its end . 
  thus if a government has an extremely low interest rate loan it makes perfect sense not to pay it off for decades or centuries because : 1 ) the return on the money is often considerably ** higher ** than the actual interest on the loan . 
  2 ) inflation over a very long time greatly devalues the loan so when you must finally pay it off it is for a considerably smaller sum . 
  so to recap , lower interest rate than the return on investment , combined with inflation over very long periods , means the us government ** does not ** and should not treat a loan like you or i. 
  you can respond if you want to but i 'm done with the conversation . 
  if you want to keep spouting off this nonsense go ahead but i 'm done with responding to it . 
  that depends do you have a business that does 17 trillion dollars worth of revenue annually ? 
  is the debt a 30 year super low rate loan , and are you an immortal , who has never defaulted on a loan before ? 
  the united sates is not a person , and it does n't manage its finances like one . 
  oh you 're one of those people , china is n't even the majority holder of us debt and they hold in the neighborhood of 6 to 7 % . 
  nearly 2/3rds of us debt is owned domestically . 
   the regulation only refers to business-to-business contracts . 
  why is that so much better exactly ? 
  it puts large well established businesses in a position of great market power to strike deals which are beneficial to them . 
  and large services can often raise their prices to compensate for the increased service fees and consumers may have very few alternative options . 
  small businesses or startups by contrast will not be in a position to negotiate aggressively for the best deals . 
  and they 'll have a considerably harder time competing with larger organizations as a result . 
  one of the greatest values of the internet has been that it levels the playing field . 
  in the past large organizations always had an enormous advantage because advertising and communication was hard / expensive , the internet allows basically anyone to go toe to toe with a global brand in terms of communications and advertising with only a minimal investment . 
  now things are shifting back in the other direction , where large businesses will almost certainly get preferential deals compared to nobody startups . 
   should , ** within contractually agreed limits ** on data volumes and speeds for internet access services so what is to stop isp 's from making contractual agreements which tilt the advantage towards the big businesses ? 
  it is perfectly possible for another company to be injured not by attacking them but by helping their competitors . 
  what if large service providers strike deals with content providers and consumers are offered a package with ultra hd , ultra high speed youtube access ? 
  while other websites may still work , and they wo n't be blocked by and isp provider , the large services will still have a major competitive advantage thanks to the deals they 're able to strike . 
   the proposed regulation mentions that the creation of private lanes should not happen at the expense of the speeds of the public lane . 
  there 's a big difference between `` should not '' and `` will not '' this is one of those foot in the door moments . 
  now the isp 's are allowed to provide private services which are presumably more lucrative than public services . 
  that ** is ** where the incentive is , telling people that they should n't do something does shit all when the incentives tell them otherwise . 
  at the end of the day it 's a question of enforcement , and you 've just made it a whole lot harder to enforce against preferential treatment . 
  if the question is black and white ( neutrality or not ) than it 's relatively simple to enforce , if you can show that a fast lane exists ** at all ** you win . 
  if the fast lane is allowed to exist in the first place then you 've crossed the line into the question of interpretation . 
  isp 's are of course going to argue that the discrepancies are temporary , or justified , and thus reasonable . 
  this is a chipping away at the edges situation , every time an isp is able to argue that some inequality is legally justified that strengthens their case to do it again . 
  it might not be much of an issue ** now ** but it 's a question of how this will evolve over time . 
  the foot is in the door , now is somebody going to slam that door , or is that door going to be gradually inched open ? 
   how do you feel about china selling off large amounts of us debt ? 
  i do n't feel much about it , the fact that china is able to sell it means that there 's someone else who is willing to buy it . 
   is the defense department going to pay back the social security trust fund ? 
  or the student loan bubble , etc yeah the ss deficit is a problem , and so is student debt . 
  how big of a problem , not that big , the student debt bubble does n't hold a candle to the mortgage bubble . 
  and we weathered that pretty well . 
  as for the ss fund deficit , it 's really no different from the same issue that most of europe is facing right now . 
  social security is n't a savings account , it 's paid for in real time by the current tax base . 
  the upcoming ss deficit is the result of a demographic inversion caused by retiring baby boomers . 
  as they retire the smaller generation x will be expected to pay for more retirees which will cost more . 
  but at least in our case the inversion is temporary , generation x is considerably smaller than the millennial generation so after we deal with the boomers it 's smooth sailing for some time after that . 
  in europe by contrast the inversion occurs and then never corrects , ever smaller generations will be expected to provide pensions for the larger retiree generation in front of them . 
  and this being europe they 'll be expected to pay far more than americans will since ss is a comparatively modest program . 
  yeah , i agree , i think there 's a good chance that you would end up with a super corporate isp where all the big guys agree to work together . 
  internet from corporate isp is pretty cheap , and you get great access to netflix / hulu / youtube etc. 
  but smaller less well known organizations get shafted . 
  in the end i think a lot of people who just want netflix would pick the cheapest option and that would have a really bad effect on the free communication / thought potential of the internet . 
  no politics on our internet , just a lot of pictures of cats and high def youtube content .
