  it 's important to remember that the big companies that are on `` our side '' today , are still big companies that primarily care about making money . 
  just because they 're with us today does n't mean our interests are their interests . 
   people do not have the choice to switch so easily ? 
  it certainly is n't easy to switch here , because we have so few isp 's . 
  and even of the very few we have they tend to have local monopolies ( no other options available in a specific town / neighborhood / building ) . 
  in many parts of europe it 's relatively easy to switch to a new carrier . 
  that being said , i 'm glad that the we 've implemented regulations in this area . 
  because i think the internet has a special and vital role in society , it 's a good thing that we 've recognized that with common carrier laws . 
  i just think there should also be a greater effort taken to increase competition in the isp markets in the us . 
  he understands the point he 's making is that europe has actually done a better job than us ( this time ) at creating a market based solution to the problem . 
  the u.s. government is ** supposed ** to intervene in situations where natural monopolies discourage competition . 
  in this case that means that they should be doing a lot more to prevent local monopolies that isp 's have in this country . 
  because in europe ** even if ** they pass shitty net neutrality legislation there is an available market solution to get around the legislation . 
  an isp can just declare themselves the `` neutral isp '' and refuse to throttle any content . 
  so long as customers vote with their wallets and demonstrate that true net neutrality is important to them the legislation is effectively meaningless . 
  because any isp actually taking advantage of the legislation will be out competed by other isp 's who are giving customers what they want . 
  this is why market based solutions are * generally * the best , because they allow customers to vote , every single day , with their wallets . 
  and in a truly competitive market the people who benefit the most are almost always the consumers . 
  it 's good that we have legislation against internet `` fast lanes '' but it would be better ( in my eyes at least ) if the government just intervened against monopolistic practices and let market forces dictate the practical reality . 
  after all if we had many options for isp providers netflix could just say . 
  `` hey guys isp x wants us to pay extra to deliver netflix content , so we will not be working with this isp . 
  if you want to use the netflix service you must use one of the following isp 's available in your region '' . 
  free markets  government regulation , * almost * always . 
  yeah i know what you mean , it 's a trait that i think is a good thing like 90 % of the time . 
  especially in a social sense it makes it a lot easier for people who are different to live with each other . 
  on the other hand , when you really need people to pay attention and think about an issue seriously it 's really fucking hard . 
  because if people do n't feel like an issue directly impacts their lives they 're ambivalent . 
  that being said it 's the attitude i 'm used to , and i would have a very hard time adjusting to a populous that feels the need to be really involved in * everything * . 
  the fact that we have more debt is actually an indicator of how well we 're doing compared to russia , not that we 're in trouble and they are n't . 
  the thing about borrowing money ( going into debt ) is that you can only really do it , if you 've already got a shit ton of money . 
  the more people are willing to lend to you is an indicator of how likely it is that they 'll be paid back . 
  the american government can borrow huge sums of money , at extremely low interest rates , precisely because everyone assumes we 're good for it . 
  and the truth is they are almost certainly right , odds are america is going to be either a or ** the ** leading global power for the next century or more . 
  so it 's a pretty damn good bet that we 'll be repaying our loans . 
  russia literally ca n't go into debt like america can because nobody really thinks they 're good for the money . 
  yeah , that 's more the initiation of hostilities , not exactly a battle , there were n't even any casualties . 
  hard to call it a proper battle if no one dies . 
  the first battle of the civil was is generally considered to be the first battle of bull run . 
   outside companies and they invest that happens less when you 've got a history of screwing over foreign investors ( which russia does ) . 
  and when your national leaders have a habit of antagonizing more than 50 % of the global economy . 
  russia is n't canada down on its luck after an oil bust . 
  russia does its damn best to antagonize the world on a regular basis for very little gain . 
  ahh yeah it 's a hard thing to understand from the outside because by the nature of our political discourse and our media it would seem to outsiders that americans are very passionate about a lot of things . 
  which do n't get me wrong , we are , but at the same time , americans also just do n't care . 
  so for example lets talk about donald trump since he 's all over the news right now . 
  his popularity might give people the impression that americans are very worried about for example immigration / illegal immigrants . 
  and in a political sense yeah maybe they are , as in if you ** ask people ** are you worried about illegal immigrants , they might say `` yes '' . 
  but in a much more practical sense americans do not care , they are n't going to do anything about illegal immigrants themselves , they sure as hell do n't want to pay more taxes to patrol the border better , they are n't going to go to anti immigration rallies . 
  americans have a very strong attitude of `` mind your own fucking business '' . 
  it 's a big part of why it 's easy for people to move here and integrate , because at the end of the day nobody gives a shit , get a dog , get a house , get a car , go to work . 
  if you do that stuff , you 're an american . 
  nobody cares what you eat , nobody cares what your religion or your traditions are , nobody cares who your parents were , or where you 're from . 
  it 's not that we respect outside culture , it 's that we do n't give a shit about your culture , so long as you take care of your own shit we do n't care . 
  you can keep your culture if you want to , but you 've got to live with everyone so do n't be a dick or make it an issue . 
  edit : also we do n't know what `` american '' actually means , our culture is totally undefined and it can mean pretty much whatever you want it to . 
  in europe people care a lot about their heritage , their ancestry , their past , americans do n't . 
  in part because we just do n't have much of a history in the first place , but even still we 're future obsessed the past is something that happened but now lets move on . 
  the worst war in american history was the civil war , and the first battle of that war took place in mananas virginia . 
  if you go there today do you know what you 'll find ? 
  not some monument commemorating the beginning of a historic conflict , nope , there 's a shopping mall there . 
  not at the moment , and why would we , the russians are willing to do it for many times cheaper than we could . 
  if that was n't an option we 'd do it ourselves , but like keto_naru is pointing out , why do it yourself , when someone else will do it cheaper ? 
  i 'm a new mexican by birth , and personal definition , though i think nyc is the tits . 
  what a ridiculous argument , we 've been getting into space for decades now . 
  and the russians are using very old equipment and operating that equipment at a financial loss to do so . 
  american politicians and policy makers are basically chose to take the hit to prestige in order to save a lot of money . 
  in america money has always talked louder than being the `` biggest , the best , or the fastest '' . 
  we like all of those things too , but in the end if you ca n't do it for a profit , do n't do it . 
   was n't that the space shuttle program before it was shut down ? 
  right , and then we shut it down . 
  but significantly in the u.s. we can do stupid shit without it really impacting our lives in a negative way . 
  it 's one thing to spend 500k on a brand new car to show off when you 've got 100 million in the bank . 
  it 's another thing to behave that way when your industry , education and demographics are in collapse and you 've got an average life expectancy of 65 with fully 25 % of men dead before the age of 55 . 
  only place in europe i 've ever really felt `` at home '' as an american . 
  north western europe is way to organized and socially conscious for me to ever live there . 
  too many rules , and more importantly people actually follow the rules , and you 'll be reprimanded by random citizens for breaking them . 
  spain and italy people are just too into their country / their region , felt like i could live there but never really be one of them . 
  central europe is way to monochromatic , and there 's just too much low level hostility / anger / pessimism for me to deal with on a regular basis . 
  with the exception of romania , romania would probably be my second choice after portugal . 
  portugal is one of the few places i 've been which feels as apathetic as america . 
  people there just kind of do n't give a shit , they do n't know where your ' e from , and they do n't care . 
  the portuguese are just chill , it 's one of very few places where i feel like i could live and not feel like an outsider . 
  not because portuguese are super welcoming , but because they 've got an american style apathy that feels very comfortable to me . 
  also the food is awesome and the climate is pretty great . 
  edit : i guess answered with a european country because this is / r/europe but i would also be totally down to live in mexico . 
  portugal . 
  and that three wheeled car , fuck that thing . 
  - mr. bean, 
  7.7 billion still sounds pretty high , as far as il aware they 've mostly been supplied with some at weapons , which are expensive but 7.7 billion would be ... a lot of those . 
  ahhh i see , because even though they have a majority ( compared to any other party ) their attempt to form a government can still be blocked by the minority parties working in conjunction ? 
  so now the situation is that the right wing party has `` permission '' to form a government , but they lack the ability to actually do so ? 
  and the left wing government has the ability to create a government , but they have n't been granted permission by the president ? 
  not portuguese but my girlfriend is , the way she tells it is this . 
  the democrats formed a coalition of the more conservative parties . 
  the socialists and the communists refused to form a coalition prior to the election . 
  as a result the democrats received a majority of the seats , compared to any other party ( though not a majority of total seats ) thus giving them the right to form a government . 
  now ** after ** the election the communists and socialists are expressing their desire to form a coalition , select a prime minister and form their own government . 
  but this decision was made ** only after ** both liberal parties already lost the election . 
  they went to the president and requested that they be allowed to create a coalition , hold a new election , and form a new government ( literally weeks after the last election ) . 
  and now the president has basically said `` no , if you wanted to do that you should have done it before '' .
