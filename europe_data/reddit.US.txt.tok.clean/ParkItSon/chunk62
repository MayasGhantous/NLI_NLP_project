  i 'm going to be honest i do n't really understand how your parliamentary systems work or what powers the prime minister has . 
  but to me it seems like the president has made a reasonable decision here . 
  if the liberal parties wanted to form a coalition they should have done so prior to the election . 
  it seems that now things have n't gone their way ( for the socialists or the communists ) they 're * now * willing to compromise with each other . 
  why does n't he get british citizenship ? 
  it might concern them but at the end of the day it is n't their country and i do n't think its their right to choose the direction of something which is n't theirs . 
  if eu citizens want to have an influence over the paths of countries which are n't their own then the eu should be federalized and become a country . 
  but as things stand just working somewhere does n't mean that you should have the right to determine the long term direction of that country . 
  that would severely undermine national sovereignty . 
  it 's a pretty standard practice around the world that migrant workers / non-citizens do n't have the right to vote . 
  if you want to determine the long term fate of a country you should be obligated to tie your own fate to the long term direction of that country . 
  you should n't be allowed to influence something that you are ultimately not a part of and not tied to . 
  it 's pretty ridiculous dude ... http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-porn-legislation-what-is-now-banned-under-new-government-laws-9898541.html, 
   by that logic every last tribe in the amazonas or in central africa should constantly be at war with each other since they have less then infinity . 
  what ridiculous `` logic '' war is one means of addressing an intractable difference of opinion between groups . 
  but it is far from being the only method , if you do n't think you 'll win , or if you do n't think that winning is worth the loss , you 're likely to go about addressing your issues in some other manner . 
  but the fact that war has been a human practice on ** every continent ** in ** every age of human existence ** is reasonable evidence that war is in fact a inevitable element of the human experience . 
   war is n't an inevitability of mankind ; it 's an complete , and above all shameful failure every time . 
  conflict and competition is an inevitable element of the human experience . 
  by what right are the swiss rich wile the eritreans are poor ? 
  is this a failure of men , or a failure of geography , or a failure of both ? 
  all the world is not switzerland , and the swiss would probably prefer that all of the poor and the downtrodden not live there . 
  as a swiss do you believe that you `` deserve '' the life you have ? 
  because as i see it there are literally billions of people the world over who `` deserve '' a high quality of life every bit as much as a swiss or as much as an american . 
  but so far as i 'm aware most people are not volunteering to give it to them . 
  point and case the current migrant crisis in europe and the growing opposition to it . 
  there are those out there who through no fault of their own were born with infinitely less than you . 
  who will never have the opportunities you have . 
  you i would hazard to guess are not prepared to give away all that you have to those with far less . 
  and so why should n't they take it , what right do you have to it that those less fortunate do not ? 
  war is just another form of competition , and competition is inevitable . 
  perhaps one day competition will no longer be necessary , but that day is still some ways off . 
  we built a few ships so we do n't have to stay on the other side of it though . 
  but hey , please lecture the americans on morality , by the way have you returned all the bars melted down from jewish couples wedding rings yet ? 
  neutrality for preservation does n't make you moral , just apathetic . 
  where do you think nasa gets a huge chunk of its funding ? 
  the space shuttle was built with huge cross range capability for military reasons . 
  well not in switzerland they do n't , but we do n't all have a ring of mountains to hide behind . 
  there is no `` global order '' there is no law , the global system is anarchic . 
  there may someday be a global order , we 're closer today than we once were . 
  but we 've got a long way to go . 
  thucydides said it best :  `` right , as the world goes , is only in question between equals in power , while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must . '', 
   i think these mistakes happen too often . 
  compared to what , `` one time is one time to many '' is a nice sentiment . 
  but i prefer to compare things to actual historical cases and base my expectations on reality rather than an entirely theoretical ideal . 
  the war in afghanistan has resulted in the neighborhood of ** 25,000 ** civilian deaths . 
  when the soviets invaded afghanistan 30 years ago the end result was between ** 850,000 and 1,500,000 ** civilian deaths . 
  that does n't mean we should n't work to do better , but when you say `` it happens too often '' i think it makes more sense to offer an actually relevant comparison . 
  if you want to criticize american doctrine that criticism should be grounded in some sort of sensible expectations . 
   come on , this is bullshit , the only thing it was , was a statement to say dont commit war crimes . 
  that was the entire un 's action , it meant almost nothing , stopping something that had almost no impact whatsoever is ridiculous . 
  if the un statement is so insignificant why do you care so much if the united states blocked it or not ? 
  at the end of the day this was a political decision probably aimed at reassuring saudi arabia after the u.s. reached a nuclear accord with the iranians who the saudis see as their major foe in the region . 
  it might be distasteful but as you said , the resolution was fairly unimportant in either case and so the united states used it to demonstrate support for the saudis . 
  balance of power politics do n't play very nicely with idealism , but uniformed american idealism played no small part in the iraq and afghanistan mess . 
  it 's a hard truth but america being a little more pragmatic in its foreign affairs is probably better than our ideals leading us into situations we do n't fully understand . 
   been saying this for awhile . 
  talk is cheap  what exactly investment does the us make here ? 
  it 's pretty much all completely negative . 
  even if europe made zero ( which is obviously bullshit ) , it would still be better than the almost purely destructive influence that the us is having . 
  do you mean in europe or around the world ? 
  in europe american military investment has mostly gone towards re-assuring the baltic states and central europe that nato will be there in the event of a russian incursion . 
  because the european mainland powers ( france and germany ) have been decidedly tepid in their response to what is seen by border states as a credible existential threat . 
  around the world american investments have helped to maintain the sovereignty of taiwan , prevented a war between north and south korea , stopped ethnic cleansing in the balkans , and are currently a critical element in the power balance in se asia . 
  they 've maintained open sea lanes and trade access for countries as small as uruguay and iceland . 
  the u.s. military was there after the nepal earthquake , the haiti earthquake , the indonesian tsunami and after dozens of other notable natural disasters . 
  is it a perfect organization , of course not , but its global influence is very far from being `` purely destructive '' . 
  and such a characterization just shows that you 're more of a zealot and an ideologue than someone seriously considering the moral and practical role of the u.s. military / u.s. foreign policy . 
  i think the hospital bombing was an unfortunate mistake , i think mistakes happen , and i think in a war zone mistakes cause people to die . 
  i do n't like that these things happen , but they happen , and they will continue to happen . 
  i think the u.s. makes a frankly massive effort to avoid collateral damage whenever possible . 
  we 've made huge investments into weapons designed to minimize collateral damage and we 've been very successful . 
  compared to the wars of the past we 've been hugely successful at reducing collateral damage , but in war collateral damage will always exist . 
  as for blocking political action in the un i 'll say once again that when you are actually involved in the world you make compromises . 
  only sideline critics get to claim the uncompromising moral high ground . 
  during ww2 america was aligned with the soviet union despite the fact that they knowingly starved to death around 10 million ukrainians . 
  the saudis might be less than angelic , but they are n't that bad , though to be fair yemen is n't exactly nazi germany . 
  moral absolutism is a luxury reserved for those who are sitting on the sidelines , american politicians do n't have the luxury of only working with those who meet the exacting human rights standards of western democracies . 
  if europeans are as concerned as they claim to be with american foreign policy they should make the societal investment to be more involved with the world . 
  both counter american activity they consider objectionable , and as a partner to strengthen the american hand when they do agree with us . 
  but in a world where europe remains weak and distant , american politicians will work with the reality that exists on the ground . 
  and that will sometimes mean making compromises with imperfect partners . 
  do these things concern me , yes , but i also do n't even close to understand all of the elements being considered here . 
  and i 'm weary of criticism from those who themselves do n't make a real investment in global involvement , and have nothing to offer but criticism . 
  i would tell you that wars have casualties and accidents happen . 
   or that it prevents the un from simply stating that the belligerents in yemen should n't commit war crimes ? 
  i would say the un is well known to be a pretty ridiculous organization in many ways . 
  it 's highly political organization which loves to make `` criticisms '' depending on who is chairing a particular community without actually doing anything about it . 
  i think that the eu and the un are both organizations which are largely un-involved with the world at large so they like to claim the moral high ground because if you do n't do anything , you wo n't accidentally do something wrong . 
  if the eu cares so much about the injustices in the world , they should actually make an effort to be involved . 
  instead of just sitting on the sidelines and criticizing the united states . 
   from a purely business point of view , a pretty dumb move for a start up . . top comment , by an estonian  who reflect a large part of their population . 
  there are plenty of americans who think like this , half of the anti-america mongers on / r/worldnews are americans , being super critical of american is really fucking american . 
   but if they 're not taking this as seriously as we are then what business do we have providing their security ? 
  who is `` they '' it is literally ** two people ** who do n't want to take money from the u.s. military . 
  not the latvian government , just two random fucking people who happen to run a company . 
  it has nothing to do with the vast majority of latvians or the latvian government in any way . 
  saying `` they '' makes absolutely no sense in this context . 
  dude what do you want , that all companies in nations reviving u.s. military assistance be obligated to do business with us ? 
  that sounds distinctly un-american , independent companies have the right to do whatever they want .
