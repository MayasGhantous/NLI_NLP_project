  the idea that we should somehow force people to work with us / for us is ridiculous . 
  i also get annoyed about european freeloading on nato defense but the baltic states are either fulfilling or working hard to fulfill their 2 % commitments . 
  they 've earned our support and the idea of somehow conscripting citizens to work with us in a business sense is ridiculous . 
  yes , spending millions of dollars to save thousands of lives of largely desperately poor people in indonesia is certainly in our best economic interests . 
  further america acting in its own interests is not a bad thing , it 's a natural thing , people mostly act in their own interests its what they do . 
  that does n't mean there are n't choices in ** how ** you act in your own interests . 
  i 'm honestly not interested in arguing is america good or bad with someone who has clearly already made up their mind . 
  at the end of the day however the u.s. military does a lot of things from disaster aid , to search and rescue , to defending the global shipping lanes . 
  if you do n't want to take money from the u.s. military to develop your drone tech that 's no skin off my back . 
  there are more than enough companies out there developing similar technologies that will . 
  i just think its morally simplistic to say `` we do n't want to take money from the u.s. military because our product is about `` joy '' '' . 
  especially when at the end of the day you 're making a luxury product for rich white people . 
  u.s. military spending and technology development has created many technologies which have saved lives both in a military context and in a civilian context . 
  so i think its kind of silly to refuse funding on the grounds that `` the military kills people '' . 
  latvian company is not the same as the latvian government , or the latvian people . 
  it 's just that company and its owners , and they can say whatever they want . 
  it has zero impact on u.s. policies in the region . 
  depends on your perspective , unfortunately the world is imperfect and pacifism is a nice idea , without a historical history of success . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_unified_assistance what if i told you the u.s. military does more things than just killing people . 
   so , kind of a double-edged sword for the us , if the eu were to become powerful . 
  yes if the eu becomes more powerful and more coherent it will create a new set of problems / challenges . 
  that is just a fact of life , every solution is a new problem at some point down the road . 
  that does n't change the fact that when people in u.s. foreign policy today say `` fuck the eu '' they do n't mean , `` the eu is a powerful organization with views counter to our own '' . 
  they mean `` this is like herding cats , it 's impossible to get a definitive answer and it is n't even clear whose in charge '' . 
  they are n't bashing the eu for existing , they think it does n't go far enough . 
  many believe the eu needs to become closer , or it needs to be more divided . 
  right now much of the eu is in the `` worst of both worlds '' position where sovereignty in many places is severely degraded . 
  but the mechanisms to rebalance the inequalities in the union do n't exist . 
  i know i was just reiterating and expanding a bit . 
  that reaction is n't because they literally `` hate '' the eu . 
  americans who pay attention to this sort of thing feel that the eu is impotent / indecisive / slow . 
  so for an american politician working with the eu on something like sanctions is frustrating as hell . 
  but these people would prefer the eu be stronger and more decisive , so if you think that means they hate it you 're missing the point . 
  they sold the ships to egypt a few days ago and took no financial loss . 
  ships like these that are ready to sail off the lot are a pretty hot commodity actually . 
  since usually it requires you to put a ton of money down for a product you wo n't be seeing for years . 
  germany is hardly helpful either , but that 's germany , they never want to be seen as aggressive involved in anything even vaguely militaristic . 
  france is frequently the spearhead of what amounts to anti-nato posturing , and they 've been signaling from early in the conflict that they 're really looking for a way to end sanctions as soon as possible . 
   its foolish not to want one of the most powerful firmly democratic countries in the world in nato . 
  unless their political maneuvering within the organization serves to undermine its mission . 
  france may have a capable military but dealing with their political bullshit makes them * barely * worth it . 
  they 're doing their best to undermine nato in eastern europe as we speak . 
  france does n't have a preferential deal because of your military capacity you 've got a preferential deal is because of your political role in europe . 
  and in no small part because the french authorities have a centuries long history of demanding a `` special role '' or they take their ball and go home . 
   with help from the resistance , the allies also succeeded in slipping french general henri giraud out of vichy france on hms seraph -- passing itself off as an american submarine -- intending to offer him the post of commander in chief of french forces in north africa after the invasion . 
  however , giraud would take no position lower than commander in chief of all the invading forces , a job already given to eisenhower . 
  when he was refused , he decided to remain `` a spectator in this affair '' . 
  france , we may not be doing shit all but we damn well expect to be treated like the most important kids at the party . 
  do n't let the door hit you on the way out . 
   so in case of an actual conflict you 'll surrender ? 
   and thus with the power to protect others in an actually significant manner right , just so long as by `` protect others '' you mean run out of ordinance within a couple of weeks and need help from the americans . 
  france has done nothing to deserve the right to veto new nato members . 
  how much time do we allocate talking about the german victims of ww2 ? 
  and there were plenty of innocent victims , but at the end of the day when you go way to far , you lose a lot of sympathy . 
  is it fair , no not really , everyone is an individual and to judge people based on things they had no involvement in , or control over , is quite unfair . 
  it is however how humanity operates , in the yugoslav conflicts serbians earned to the reputation as the bad guys for good reason . 
  and that is going to forever put a damper on the sorts of sympathies people are going to feel for everyone who wares the wrong label . 
  once you cross the line into ethnic cleansing , it almost does n't matter what came before . 
  i read the article and have no idea what this is about ? 
  do you want to self certify and we wo n't let you ? 
  or do we say self certification is invalid and you say it is n't ? 
  also what is this even about , trade , or literal harbor safety . 
  i could google all of these questions but i think an article should at least ** try ** to explain what 's going on , and if it does n't maybe you should post a better article ? 
  oh right fracking the boogie man for ignorant and uninformed . 
  you should maybe actually do a bit of research before you believe every half witted pseudo scientific claim about `` evil fracking '' . 
  get bent euro trash . 
  are you fucking joking ? 
  that 's like saying `` i passed the test because i snuck in an answer key , but hey if you 'd do n't like it make tests that that ca n't be passed by people who snuck in an answer key '' . 
  poor poor little germany , cheat on the test , get caught , claim cheating is n't cheating because `` the test should be better '' . 
  just because the mechanism is n't a literal common standard does n't make your position correct . 
  it is a common standard in the sense of equivalent standard recognition . 
  which is appropriate because a literal common standard would in effect be surrendering sovereignty . 
  this way nations could establish their own regulations but there is a mechanism to establish if standard equivalency is met . 
  in either case american cars do n't get an exemption from eu safety standards . 
  but if they can reasonably demonstrate that their vehicle functionally meets standards that will now be considered acceptable . 
  yeah that is n't how it works and no one seems to understand this . 
  the concept is creating a ** new ** mutually agreed upon standard . 
  neither us standards or european standards will suddenly trump the other . 
  instead an agreement is reached on standards which must be met by ** both ** partners . 
  vw intentionally scammed environmental standards , how dare we do something about it right ? 
  like your vastly inferior standards regarding vehicle emissions ? 
   afaik if ttip passes , it will mean cars with us safety standards will be able to drive in europe and endanger pedestrians . 
  that is n't how it works , a standardized safety agreement would be reached and cars meeting ** that ** standard could be sold in both the us and europe . 
  it would not mean american cars could just suddenly be sold in europe . 
  those cars would have to meet whatever standards are ultimately agreed upon . 
  cars that do n't meet that standard wo n't be able to be sold in europe . 
  while cars from europe that do n't meet the standard wo n't be able to be sold in america ( cars in america for example have larger airbags under the assumption that people in vehicles will not always wear their seat belts ) . 
  standards just make it easier for companies and people on both continents to design products which are mutually acceptable . 
  rather than being forced to modify products so that they meet two separate sets of often redundant standards . 
  so when you say protesting for environmental reasons would that mean they are for or against the epa enforcing stricter emissions standards on german companies ? 
  oh but i forgot america = does n't care about the environment but germany does and that 's why trade deals will inevitably damage environmental regulations . 
  you did see that in the past , the opposite is now happening and the country is re-urbanizing in a big way . 
   the mexico -- united states border is an international boundary running from tijuana , baja california , and imperial beach , california , in the west to matamoros , tamaulipas , and brownsville , texas , in the east . 
  the border , separating mexico and the united states from each other , traverses a variety of terrains , ranging from major urban areas to uninhabitable deserts . 
  it is the most frequently crossed international boundary in the world , with approximately 350 million legal crossings being made annually . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexico%e2%80%93united_states_border mexico is one of the largest economies in the world , they sell us a lot of stuff and we sell them a lot of stuff . 
  there are ** a ton ** of american families with relatives in mexico . 
  the mexican american border is thus needfully a very open border , it will remain so , and it will not , and can not , be meaningfully secured . 
  just so you know , none of that actually , you know , works . 
  the united states , and mexico have such a close relationship that border control is nearly meaningless .
