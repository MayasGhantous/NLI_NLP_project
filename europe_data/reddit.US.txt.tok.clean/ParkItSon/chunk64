  there are 350 million legal crossings between the u.s. / mexican border every year . 
  in other words more than the entire population of the united states crosses that border annually . 
  the popular image of `` coyotes '' smuggling bands of illegal immigrants across the border is more a romantic myth than reality . 
  the vast majority of border crossings , are just vehicles , driving across the border stuffed with immigrants . 
  a border handling so many crossings is inevitably insecure , there 's just too much activity to do meaningful screenings . 
  politicians have to talk about `` securing the border '' because saying `` we ca n't secure the border , and honestly we do n't really even want to '' is a good way to get kicked out of office . 
  consider the laughable inefficacy of the tsa at just controlling access to aircraft . 
  http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tsa-misses-95-of-weapons-explosives-in-security-tests-2015-06-01 and that 's just people with small bags crossing through tightly controlled checkpoints with high tech screening equipment . 
  now instead of that imagine millions of cars and trucks all hustling across the border for primarily legitimate trade and travel reasons ? 
  yeah , not so hard to sneak people / contraband across the border . 
  you 're right the coastguard has done a pretty good job of stopping the drug flow across the gulf of mexico . 
  but as a maritime power the united states is very very good at maritime interdiction . 
  but land border control is a lot harder , verging on impossibility , because the number of individual `` units '' crossing these borders is much higher due to transit efficiency questions ( 1 ship can carry the equivalent of many many trucks ) . 
  the only way the united states can actually secure its border with mexico is by helping mexico improve both its standards of living , and the efficacy of its government . 
  which despite mexico 's many problems , is actually happening . 
  relatively few of the immigrants now crossing our southern border are actually mexicans . 
  but for what its worth anyone in leadership knows that : a ) we can not secure our border b ) we do not want to secure our border , because the economic losses would be staggering . 
  ahh , well i just assumed it had some relation to wealth of the empire . 
  it 's still an incredibly gorgeous place , especially the palace with the insane yard ( caves , ponds , more castles , etc. 
   particularly if you are not used to drive gear shift . 
  was in portugal with my portuguese girlfriend , she does n't drive . 
  she wanted to go to sintra , i know how to drive a stick , but not well , and the sticks i 've driven are trucks . 
  grabbed a fucking go-cart from the airport , no power , no torque , makes driving a stick even more tricky . 
  went to sintra , first time i 'd driven a stick in years , almost died . 
  your advice is reasonable advice . 
  that being said , sintra is jaw to the floor insane . 
  the palaces in that place are fucking nuts , it 's a `` what if you had all the gold from brazil and 100 years and nothing else to spend your money on '' kind of place . 
  so i 'm conflicted , driving in hilly ass narrow roads , as a more than a little rusty stick driver , with a car which is ** not ** an easy stick , was kind of stressful . 
  but of all the countries to be re-learning stick technique portugal is pretty chill , everyone is super laid back and they think americans that ca n't drive stick are more funny than annoying . 
  but on the other hand , sintra is just a crazy cool place , if you can get a bus there , do it . 
  does anyone ever bother to read the articles ? 
  one of the largest costs airlines have to deal with is airport fees . 
  underutilized airports often have fees which are literally several orders of magnitude cheaper than the more heavily utilized airports . 
  new , lighter , more powerful , and more efficient aircraft give airlines an opportunity to launch with less fuel , from smaller airports , but with satisfactory luggage and passenger capacity . 
  aircraft like the 787 make it possible for many more airports to be viable international airports , which could potentially mean hugely reduced flight costs . 
  because right now hub airports are one of the biggest bottlenecks in the system . 
  that 's why airbus built the a380 , their solution to the hub and spoke bottleneck was bigger planes with more passengers . 
  boeing 's solution has been to build aircraft which can effectively operate at smaller airports , thus bypassing the hub and spoke bottleneck problem . 
  you have never met a mexican . 
  they are nothing like the spanish , specifically they do n't have a stick shoved up their ass . 
  does n't surprise me at all , the funny thing about people who like to spout off a lot about `` privilege '' are frequently the most actually privileged people around . 
  people who are actually dealing with these sorts of issues ( and do n't get me wrong there are real issues with inequality ) do n't sit around all day talking about terminology . 
  they 've got jobs , and kids to feed , and they 're way less worried about proper terminology than they are about shit which actually impacts their life . 
  this is what i hate about social justice types , they spend the vast majority of their time talking about ** bullshit ** . 
  they 're not nearly as interested in actually doing something for poor disenfranchised people as they are with showing the world how sensitive and in touch they are . 
   which lets fringe idiots like this get into power . 
  student government has power ? 
  really ? 
  here `` student government '' is like 99 % resume padding . 
  they overcame that some time ago , current barrels can fire something like 400 rounds . 
  the navy has stated a requirement for 1000 rounds . 
  here 's a good overview of the existing technology . 
  we 're bringing it back . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eagxc7hdnns in a few decades there 's a possibility that we might be fielding nuclear powered rail gun / laser cruisers if this technology pans out . 
  and this is n't necessarily a crazy pipe dream , these things would be an excellent complement to a carrier group because rail guns along with bombardment potential ( 200 mile range + ) may offer enormous relatively inexpensive aa and anti missile capability . 
  $ 25,000 rail gun round knocking down $ 500,000 anti ship missiles , you do the math . 
  i think you could make a reasonable argument that early nato membership was n't exactly voluntary for germany . 
  this all happened just a few years after the end of wwii and germany was n't * really * being treated as a sovereign state . 
  but they could certainly leave at this point and no one would stop them . 
  so i think it 's all pretty voluntary these days . 
   usa only wants things from us without giving something in return . 
  germany has a trade surplus with the united states which is equivalent to 2 % of the german economy . 
  and if you want to give us anything else we could do without the cars which are intentionally violating our emissions laws . 
  thanks . 
  there 's a difference between a security guarantees and an alliance which actually exists and the presumption that we would initiate a nuclear war to end the domination of central europe by the ussr . 
  it 's always amusing to me that americans are the ones who get labeled cowboys . 
  but at least we take a serious measure of the situation before initiating conflicts which mean the end of life for tens of millions of people . 
  are you of the opinion we should have dropped a nuke on moscow ? 
  wwii ended and the lines were drawn , and while i sympathize with those nations who lived under soviet domination for the following decades . 
  do you think another european war , this one flavored with nuclear weapons would have been best for romania ? 
  we are n't the french . 
  geo-politically speaking you may be correct . 
  but in a psychological sense uk / canada / australia these are the countries who we see as our actual allies . 
  the germans , the french , the japanese are allies so long as its in their interests . 
  but the moment they do n't think they 're getting a hell of a lot more out of the relationship then they 're putting in they 're gone . 
  uk / canada / australia on the other hand are still there even when they 'd rather not be . 
  reddit has the moral conscious of a neo-nazi , spliced with an acid dropping hippy , with the memory of a person with late stage dementia . 
  getting up votes on reddit is probably more an indictment of an idea than a resounding endorsement . 
  i know some of my most highly regarded comments are have been pretty shallow , but sometimes people interpret a simple comment as a moral statement and they get excited . 
  that all being said , mods deleting comments they do n't like is pretty silly . 
  it is n't as if you can banish the feelings by banishing the comment . 
  some of his stuff is pretty accurate high quality journalism . 
  some of his stuff is pretty biased and aimed at presenting a particular viewpoint without doing a thorough analysis . 
  for example his episode about nuclear weapons security where he highlights some embarrassing failures which he portrays as catastrophic security flaws . 
  while the truth is that failures are yes a cause for concern , but at the same time the system was designed to be hugely redundant . 
  with the understanding that people would screw up sometimes . 
  so you build a system which is resistant to human error . 
  but it 's sort of dishonest to then look at that system and to then say `` look at all these embarrassing mistakes , how secure are our stockpiles ?!, 
  not all emissions are the same . 
  a car which most efficiently converts fuel to energy is going to have the lowest co2 emissions . 
  but the most efficient process can also create relatively high amounts of nitrogen oxides , and soot . 
  building an engine that does n't emit soot requires modifications that make the engine cleaner but also uses more energy ( i think soot for example is re-burned , and this process requires the use of more gasoline / diesel ) . 
  co2 is a major pollutant on a global scale , and on a decades of centuries long time table . 
  soot and nitrogen oxides however cause an immediate and acute environmental problem where they are burned . 
  because these pollutants are both responsible for major respiratory health problems . 
  co2 by contrast is pretty harmless on a local level , we are after all breathing the stuff in and out all of the time . 
  the issue is that in very large amounts over very long periods of time this can cause planetary climate changes . 
  but acute health effects are basically non-existent . 
  here 's an idea , how about you wait for the actual emissions issues to come to light with other companies before we bring it into the conversation ? 
  so far every thread on volkswagen is some variant on `` i wonder who else is doing this '' .
