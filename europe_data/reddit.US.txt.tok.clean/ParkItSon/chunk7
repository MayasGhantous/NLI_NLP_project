  what concerns me far less than malice is the willingness to develop and calculate a plan like that and to not reconsider throughout the process . 
  that in my eyes demonstrates a severe lack of empathy , or at least a total willingness to forgo all societal norms and restraints in order to achieve ones goals . 
  and these are two things which i do n't necessarily believe can be fixed , or rehabilitated away . 
  right because all crimes are the same . 
  he was found guilty , that 's why he 's in jail in the first place , the question is has the guy who was planning an assassination really changed ? 
  seems like no , seems like someone should have wondered if that seemed very probable . 
  depends , do you mean i draw the line between first and second degree murder . 
  or do you mean i draw the line between second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter ? 
  second degree is generally considered to be malice / aforethought but without advanced planning . 
  while first degree is malice / aforethought along with willful pre-mediation . 
  planning an assassination or hiring an assassin would make you a 1st degree murderer . 
   that 's the difference between a system that aims for punishment vs. one that aims for reform . 
  i agree that our system is obsessively focused on `` punishment '' and that we should be much more reform oriented . 
  i also believe that some people can not be reformed at that those people should be kept away from society . 
  in good conditions ( better conditions than our current prisons certainly ) but away from society , forever . 
  there 's a huge difference between a crime of passion , something that happens in the moment . 
  something where reform is perfectly conceivable goal . 
  but someone who is willing to plan an assassination , or hire one , you 've crossed a line where i do n't conceive of reform as a practical possibility . 
  alright so we 're clear then , a man who gunned down 69 children , so long as he behaves himself in prions , and does n't act like a madman , let him out at the end of his sentence . 
  i 'm never going to view that as anything but naive , so we 're at an impasse . 
  in my opinion anders breivik needs to be in jail for the rest of his life . 
  not for vengeance but for the sake of simple common sense , any man willing to gun down 69 kids can not be trusted as a member of society . 
  10 year minimum , maximum of 21 years with a theoretical potential to extend in five year increments should the prisoner be considered an ongoing threat to the public . 
  but he 'll have indisputably served his sentence and unless there 's evidence that he remains a threat to the public he should * technically * be released . 
  so , should he ** actually ** be released ? 
  i think our justice system is totally fucked up . 
  but i also do n't think it is the primary cause of our relatively high crime rates compared to germany . 
  we 've got a lot of baggage as a nation that germany gets to avoid . 
   and they can not just bump up the sentencing for this one person in particular , nor can they just randomly keep him locked up without cause . 
  german law does allow for continued preventive detention of certain dangerous offenders after a completed prison term , but apparently he did n't qualify . 
  i 'm not suggesting they change the law for one guy , and honestly i do n't really care , this is germany 's problem not mine . 
  i just think that this particular case is a pretty clear example following the law severely stretching common sense . 
  and in a circumstance like that maybe the law should be looked at as in need of an update ? 
  breivik 's sentence is totally relevant , he 's a criminal who is * probably * beyond being rehabilitated . 
  norwegian law is n't * really * designed to allow lifelong sentencing though it can theoretically be bent to that purpose . 
  so if breivik behaves , shows signs of being reformed , and under norwegian law he can not be reasonably deemed a threat unless the nature of his original crime is taken into consideration . 
  should he be released ? 
  murder for hire will get you something like 50 years here , i doubt that planning an assassination would land you with an 8 year sentence . 
  answer my question , when do you think anders breivik should be released ? 
   look at your crime rates , look at ours , then have fun while your colleagues blame it all on the black people . 
  my colleagues ? 
  i 'm not blaming our problems on black people . 
  i 'll blame our problems on a system of extreme inequality which literally allowed the ownership of people , and then decades of institutional racism , and intentional segregation . 
  which persisted right up until the end of the 70 's and has persisted unofficially up until present day , though things are improving . 
  if you think i 'm some far right loony you 've got me wrong . 
  but there 's a difference between recognizing the fundamental problems within my own system . 
  and still thinking that it 's fucking dumb to release a terrorist assassin into the public after 6 years of an apparently ineffective rehabilitation program . 
  there 's being humane and then there 's just being stupid . 
  i think tigers are perfectly nice animals , and occasionally they can be more or less tamed , but 99 % of the time , tigers are dangerous . 
  avowed terrorists are either extremely devoted ideologues , severely mentally ill , or both . 
  pretty damn hard to cure mental illness , pretty damned hard to break and ideological zealot . 
  like a tiger , 99 % of the time , you probably do n't want him / her roaming around free . 
  i 'm not advocating cruelty , but there are certain people who either by birth or by choice are not fit to exist in society . 
  do you think that anders breivik should be released after he 's served his ten years ? 
   you feel that someone is a danger , so fuck the law , fuck justice , just lock them away , without charges and without trial . 
  more like what if you had laws that we 're a bit more strict with people ** planning assassinations of politicians ** . 
  seriously , eight years ? 
  eight years for plotting to kill a fucking prime minister ? 
  i 'm not sure if this is some sort of failure of your mental health evaluations or just a failure of sheer common sense . 
  but in my eyes this qualifies as pretty , fucking , dumb . 
  you might as well release a bengal tiger into the city on the basis that it has committed no crimes and so can not be held . 
  i 'm all for the more ethical treatment of prisoners , and improved rehabilitation strategies , but then there 's just naivete . 
  there are people who fall into crime due to shit circumstances , and then there are people who plot assassinations , unless you can show me some ** very ** compelling evidence that said person has be rehabilitated you 're better off keeping them in jail . 
  you 're principle are `` we will literally not put terrorists in jail '' , seriously ? 
  i 'm not telling you that you should pull out finger nails , but in this case the guy was obviously ** obviously ** an actual threat . 
  look i get that you all feel like our prison system is byzantine , and you know in a lot of cases i agree . 
  but do n't you think that just maybe you should keep known terrorists on lock down ? 
  i get that you do n't want to give them a death sentence by sending them home . 
  but come on , the guy was assessed as and pretty obviously ** was ** a threat , and something of an international criminal ? 
  you could n't put him in like a high class holding cell or something ? 
  are europeans seriously blaming their own inability to cohere for the last millennium on us now . 
  ** seriously ** ? 
  we did n't even exist as a fucking discovery much less a country . 
  europe 's cohesion problems are far far older than the united states . 
  but if you need an outside meddler to motivate you folks into getting your shit together go for it . 
  yeah i agree we 're like that , we definitely like to talk a lot . 
  and i could see how we come across as narcissistic and we kind of are . 
  i think part of it is that all americans know about is america , it 's so hard for us to get around and legitimately experience other places . 
  so if we 're having a conversation about this or that aspect of a country the only thing we can really talk about is ourselves . 
  also the portuguese are just * chill * , super nice and awesome people , but totally relaxed . 
  so it does n't surprise me that comparatively we come across as really over the top . 
   i do n't think we are as different as most people thinks we are . 
  there are places in europe where i really feel out of place , the north western technocracies are just way to rigid for me . 
  but i feel totally comfortable in portugal , just cool people , no bullshit , no falseness . 
   so what you 're saying is , it 's better because you do n't have to pay employees when you let them go ? 
  i mean yeah sort of , when you start something new you have no idea if it 's going to work at all . 
  by requiring people to have enough capital to pay their employees for months after a business venture ultimately fails it in essence reserves the opportunity to start a business to the already wealthy . 
   iirc in the uk you have to be employed for two years by a company before they are required to pay you in the event of redundancy . 
  that would cover most failed startups while not screwing over everyone yeah that 's the uk , they 're always somewhere between the united states and europe , geographically and politically . 
  look i do n't want to have this argument right now , it 's been done to death . 
  i 'm not claiming either system is superior to the other . 
  but europeans should understand that for the vast majority of americans their quality of life is every bit as good as that of europeans ( in regards to services ) . 
  so people are not being irrational in feeling our current way of doing things is a good way . 
  we do not ( all ) aspire to be more like europe , even if europeans think of their system as pinnacle of civilization . 
   i mentioned the `` chicken tax '' and the `` buy american act '' . 
  i could go on with the restrictions on foreign ownership of airlines and a myriad other petty protectionistic measures . 
  `` enormous trade access '' my arse . 
  multiple factions in u.s. government often policies of one part of the organization can oppose another . 
  an unfortunate aspect of pluralistic societies is that we 're all pulling every which way . 
  but yes , european trade access has been enormous .
