  that was a trade dispute and response , not an over riding policy . 
  germany slapped a big tax on frozen chicken due to internal pressure and we got a little bit pissed about the whole thing . 
  but the over riding policy has been one of enormous trade access . 
  the french hate the french ? 
  you do realize that it has been american policy for a solid chunk of the last 7 decades to strengthen w. europe through trade access to the american markets ? 
  in a sense it was a great big bribe to create a bastion against soviet expansion by giving europe and export market to rebuild their own wealth , so that you could defend yourselves from the soviets and maybe most importantly so that you would want to defend yourself from the soviets . 
  the trade deficit was frankly part of the plan , and it played merry hell with our economy in the 80 's / 90 's . 
  but we won the cold war without ( mostly ) having to fire a shot , so it was worth it in my eyes . 
  also you guys are pretty cool , and i 'm glad you 've managed to get back on your feat . 
  i fucking hate the french . 
  the reality is this for the vast majority of americans things are just fine , even great . 
  ** most people ** have access to perfectly good health care . 
  my job is entry level , last year i had some stomach problems ended up getting a colonoscopy , and an endoscopy , and a host of tests , at one of the top rated hospitals in the world . 
  total personal costs to myself about $ 50.00 . 
  and in the states ( unlike in europe ) you can at least start a business without having a small fortune set aside in severance pay if things do n't go well . 
  the environment here is much more conducive to try , fail , try again . 
  i 'm not saying the european system is bad , it 's more equitable and more stable , but also less dynamic and creative . 
  but i can certainly understand the appeal of living under it . 
  but do n't assume that americans are just `` hurr hurr trickle down , low taxes on the rich because i 'll be a billionaire one day '' . 
  most people know they wo n't become billionaires , but most people can get all of the services available to europeans , and with more take home pay to boot . 
  we have different systems with their own pluses and minuses but you 've got a better shot of understanding americans if you do n't just assume we 're all ignorant of our own circumstances . 
   why is america allowed to interfere with the governance of an independent country ? 
  article seven , section three of the charter of nations . 
  the precedent is set under the [ experiri curabimus , et prohibere nobis ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fajdwnn.jpg ) clause . 
  my girlfriend is portuguese , totally sending her this . 
  suddenly feeling way less sympathetic towards the greeks . 
  we 're keeping tabs on the world oceans , not the north sea . 
  you can keep your rubber ducky , we 'll keep our carriers . 
  never let the other side , decide when / where they want to have a fight . 
  thanks dad . 
   right , but that was also kept a secret from the dutch army . 
  so you stabbed us in the back , used the dutch as a scapegoat a decision was made at political level and that decision was kept quiet for practical / tactical reasons . 
  the dutch military was ** obviously ** aware of the decisions . 
  by dint of the fact that the two f-16 's which ultimately waved off ** were dutch ** . 
  if the dutch military failed to inform its men on the ground of the situation that is unfortunate . 
  but there is always going to be a breakdown between political level decisions and on the ground operational choices . 
  i 'm not claiming america / british / french forces could n't have done more , and that they should have done more . 
  but the reality of war is that communications are spotty . 
  the final responsibility stops with the units on the ground who have the information right in front of them . 
  we can argue that the dutch unit did n't receive the military or political support they should have had . 
  but as the people there , on the ground , with the most relevant and immediate information . 
  it was their duty to access the situation and respond accordingly . 
  instead they negotiated a withdrawal in what must have seemed very suspicious circumstances . 
  what should have happened as the people on the ground they should have responded to the reality of what was happening . 
  which was considerably outside of what most people along the command chain were expecting . 
  you can claim that the cia knew what was happening in real time but i do n't buy it . 
  the truth is that american intelligence today with all the improvements in technology still struggles to maintain a perfect real time accurate image of the battlefield . 
  that sort of thing is very , very hard to pull off in reality , and if we are n't capable of achieving it now we sure as hell were n't in 1995 is bosnia . 
  read the article , it 's a good analysis and explanation of the sort of considerations which go into peace and war negotiations . 
  the consideration of boundaries , and necessary if unpalatable concessions . 
  but nothing there remotely suggests that anyone `` abandoned '' the dutch . 
  the decision to withhold airstrikes was obviously kept secret so that the threat of airstrikes could maintain a deterrent value without incurring the execution of prisoners . 
  but at the end of the day this was a mission that the dutch were tasked with and utterly failed at . 
  un recommendations on required armor does n't change that , negotiations over prisoners does n't change that . 
  if the dutch felt under armed they should have brought more weapons , if they felt under imminent threat dutch fighters should have engaged regardless of the un position . 
  and if the dutch had joined in active combat against the serbs and taken casualties airstrikes could have and would have been used . 
  but being in an admittedly difficult position they instead chose to negotiate a withdrawal , they accepted conditions which violated their mandate , and then did nothing as 8000 men were executed . 
  this idea that the united states should always be tasked with providing the necessary support , or spearheading the political will , and then spearheading the military response is absurd . 
  when something awful happens europeans say `` why were n't the americans there to stop it '' . 
  and when we intervene before things deteriorate to genocide europeans say `` that was uncalled for , things could have been resolved with negotiations , americans are cowboys / warmongers '' . 
  consider this german documentary [ it started with a lie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi4kz8csyma ) . 
  arguing that the intervention into kosovo was unjustified and based somewhat on ultimately inaccurate reports of some systematic ethnic cleansing . 
  the european attitude is that if something awful happens the americans should have been there to stop it . 
  but if we intervene before things reach that level than we 're in the wrong because there has n't been any genocide quite yet . 
  and on top of this there is no willingness within europe to take responsibility . 
  if the americans were n't there its the americans fault , nothing we could have done , no options for europe . 
  ... you know how white people cant use the n word ? 
  i do n't think germans can make that joke . 
  right blame the americans :  lieutenant-colonel karremans made an urgent request for air support from the united nations for two dutch f-16s to attack the heavy armour of the vrs . 
  the attack never took place . 
  it had to be cancelled when serb forces threatened to execute 50 members of dutchbat iii who had been seized as hostages . 
  you got some of your men captured , folded to enemy demands and then retreated . 
  dutchbat was a complete failure of a dutch mission do n't try to pawn that failure off on others . 
  the dutch never stood and fought , they folded the moment they encountered resistance . 
  i 'll refine : short term : bad medium term : maybe good long term : bad  to be fair though neither is as important to future of the euro as serious systemic reform including common economic policy and shared debts . 
  to remove greece from the euro would be a complete failure to address that need for reform . 
  greece is not the disease they are a symptom of the greater problem of a fundamentally unbalanced system . 
  the removal of greece would be seen as an indication of an unwillingness to address the fundamental flaws within the euro system . 
   turkey has a psychopath islamic dictator at it 's head no , it does n't it has a democratically elected president who you do n't like very much so you 're referring to him as a dictator . 
   as you can see , any country who embraces islam faces big issues . 
  remember when germany embraced islam and they executed several million jews / gypsies / etc. 
  oh wait what 's that germany is and was a ** christian nation ** how do you explain that ? 
   and all of middle east is filled with shit and wars and more and more problems . 
  europe was at war with itself for three decades , over 100 million people died violently . 
  the only more extreme violent cause of death ** in human history ** was the mongol invasions . 
  the most recent chinese civil war ( non-muslims ) involved some ** 4 million deaths ** . 
  and the japanese invasion of china caused somewhere in the neighborhood of ** 40 million deaths ** , all of this perpetrated by ** non muslims ** . 
   hristianity is not so good either , but compared to islam it looks very peaceful . 
  1914-1945 , 100 million people died violently , so yeah christian nations are so peaceful . 
   trying to prove islam is the best religion in the world . 
  i do n't have any love for islam , i just take exception to the intellectually dishonest and historically inept understanding of the world . 
  people that wants to look at the last 20 years as being some how representative of world history . 
  the middle east is in a period of turmoil caused by many factors , and yes one of those factors is religious conflict . 
  but europe has hardly been immune from massive ethno-religious conflicts either . 
   show us a solution the solution , i can think of a few but none of them are cheap or easy . 
  creating peace in europe took nothing less than the literal occupation of half of europe by one power ( russia ) and the de-facto occupation of the other half by another power ( the united states ) . 
  with the threat of nuclear warfare the two global powers imposed stability and order on a previously conflict ridden continent and things have been pretty calm since then . 
  europe had the advantage of being incredibly significant to global politics and security that the mid-east lacks however . 
  so the middle east like pre-american europe is in a constant struggle with itself . 
  no nation is powerful enough to defeat all the others so conflict persists .
