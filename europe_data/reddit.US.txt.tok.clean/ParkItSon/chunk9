  which was exactly the situation in europe for centuries until the global super powers functionally engulfed the fractured countries and brought them into a common purpose . 
  and then of course there was the war itself , something about a period of conflict as devastating as the world wars gave europeans a real desire not to do that again . 
  the middle east has never experienced a catastrophic conflict on the scale of the world wars to drive home the extreme aversion to conflict that many europeans have . 
   christianity does n't promote slavery yes it does . 
   or killing infidels yes it does . 
   but islam does yes it does . 
  all religions are pretty backwards and archaic . 
  the important thing is that at the end of the day it is ** people ** who follow them . 
  and people change even though the thousand year old books they read do not . 
  muslims have some different beliefs from christians its true but at the end of the day the ** vast majority ** of muslims are just people who want a job / a family / and a decent quality of life . 
  only an extreme minority of people actually elevate these beliefs over their desire for a life . 
  and while there are considerably more muslims than this extreme minority who have outlandish views the vast majority of them value their quality of life over their beliefs . 
  just like christian extremists in the states , they may talk a lot of shit about the government `` infringing on their beliefs '' . 
  but at the end of the day they 're way less worried about their beliefs than they are about having a normal life . 
  so they do n't do or cause problems , except by electing morons , but such is life in a democratic republic . 
  oh please , i do n't have any love for islam or christianity or any religion for that matter . 
  but to suggest that europe is some sort of bastion of peace and enlightenment which muslims will somehow spoil with violence and barbarism is ** laughable ** . 
  europe and europeans have been responsible for conflicts so enormous and mind numbingly violent that they make the very worst islamic crusades look like a paper cut . 
  the soviets happily demonstrated that freedom from religion does not in any way curtail a nations ability to partake in violent extremist crusades . 
  the middle east is a region which is currently in conflict , like europe in the previous century . 
  it is a melange of dictatorships / fledgling democracies / monarchies and these nations and factions are striving to find some balance which often brings them into conflict with their neighbors and themselves . 
  but do n't pretend to me that islam is inevitably and eternally linked to barbarism and violence . 
  when it is a demonstrable fact that it is n't . 
  the middle east like europe in the past is going through a period of turmoil which breeds levels of ideological extremism not seen in the past . 
  the problem with islam in europe is a lot like the problem with african americans in the states . 
  people who 've been isolated , and ignored by society do not feel like they are a part of it . 
  people who feel isolated will look for acceptance and community where they can find it and for some that means global islam . 
  this is a problem , but it is n't an existential problem , and it is something which can be addressed with effort . 
  and what happens when one of those economically stable nation goes through a period of instability ? 
  you kick them out ? 
  what do you think this is the last time this will happen ? 
  you think germany is immune to economic hardship ? 
  deal with your fucking problems , do n't just kick the can down the road and wait until the next crisis . 
  i 'm totally pro immigrant . 
  i 've got no problems with people wanting to build mosques for worship . 
  i also would n't in a million years want the saudis to be directly involved in building those mosques . 
  i do n't trust the saudis , not because they 're muslims but because they want to use islam as a way exert influence and control over people and nations . 
  maybe but in the long term i think it will destroy the currency . 
  the value a currency is maybe more than anything else dependent on trust . 
  people trust the u.s. dollar because they know that it 'll still be there tomorrow ( or a century from now ) . 
  in the short term removing greece from the equation might improve the strength and stability of the euro . 
  but in the long term it 's an enormous blow against the perceived strength of the currency . 
  i feel that i keep needing to remind people that this , ** will not ** be the last economic disaster . 
  there will be more , over the years there will be many more . 
  if europe shows that their solution to problems is to amputation rather than finding a solution . 
  than from now on the world will remember that this is an option , and that will deeply undermine the trust in the euro . 
  remember when you guys were saying `` we will do whatever it takes to save the euro '' . 
  so you meant whatever it takes unless what it takes is actually hard ? 
  the arab oil states are basically the national equivalent of trust fund babies . 
  they 're spoiled , lazy , intolerant of others , and they consider very little to be more important than their personal comfort . 
  these are people who i do not want to mimic in any way . 
  kuwait is a lot like qatar , you know the people who we all hate because they use what amounts to foreign slave labor to build world cup stadiums ? 
  but so long as they 're re-enforcing the idea that xenophobia is basically rational and acceptable we think they 're right ? 
   if only your congress could agree on that . 
  agree on what , we do agree on the issue , the argument is between sanctions and more sanctions . 
  nobody here is suggesting that russia has done anything in recent months to warrant an easing of sanctions . 
   our economy is tied with russia 's . 
  if we put up your stupid sanctions , we hurt our own economy too . 
  cry me a mother fucking river , as the global consumers we 've been opening up our markets to most of the world for the last seven decades . 
  in large part with the explicit purpose of encircling and containing soviet expansion . 
  that has come at the cost of basically killing huge sectors of our manufacturing industry . 
  we 've since bounced back but it was very far from easy or painless . 
  so pardon me for not being oh so sympathetic that you 've had to put up with the minor economic hardship of maintaining pretty limited sanctions on one country for like a year . 
  once you 've up ended your entire economy for the sake of rebuilding and strengthening entire countries with which you were previously at war with . 
  to contain an expansionist empire , largely without having to resort to violence . 
  then you can come and whine about the fact that sanctions hurt your economy a little bit ** for a year ** . 
   us actually has a very high economic benefit for shit to hit the fan in europe no we do n't , we would become more wealthy ** in relative terms ** to the europeans . 
  which is not remotely the same thing as becoming more wealthy . 
  the u.s. has nothing to gain from a shattered europe . 
  people here want a higher quality of life , not a higher quality of life compared to a bombed out ruin . 
  if only you had the backing of the nation with the largest , most powerful military in human history , and with the most nukes to boot ? 
  the united states has continued and recently increased sanctions pressure while the french have started to talk about an end to sanctions . 
  no one is telling you to invade russia , just to not back down the moment you 've got an opportunity . 
  yes and you guys are so concerned that you 're going to demonstrate your indigence by lifting sanctions the moment putin puts and end to the fighting . 
  thus demonstrating that europe takes this sort of thing seriously and they wo n't look the other way so long as they are n't personally being invaded ? 
  he was n't talking about russia but the serbs in bosnia . 
  when some 300 + dutch soldiers failed to defend the town of srebrenica and some 8000 bosniak muslims were executed . 
  1995 would be a reference to conflicts in bosnia a conflict where dutch `` peace keepers '' literally stood around and watched while bosnian muslims were systematically murdered by serbian forces . 
  i want europe to at bare minimum to stand against genocide on their own continent . 
  instead it took an american intervention and invasion to put an end to the fighting and the ethnic cleansing going on . 
  oh i 'm sorry i jumped the gun , when the final report is released on october 13th i 'm sure russia will switch from a stance of literally presenting obviously doctored photos as evidence . 
  to a stance of accepted responsibility and paying reparations . 
  do n't make me fucking laugh . 
   it 's easy to speak like that when you 're comfortably looking at the battle from thousands of miles away you 're right if war breaks out with russia the united states is definitely not going to be absorbing the lions share of nuclear ordinance . 
  the u.s. is no more isolated from a conflict like this than belarus . 
  the major difference is that despite being half a world away we 've actually got assets on the ground and we do n't back down on sanctions the moment that putin makes the slightest `` concessions '' . 
  in this case `` concessions '' refers to sort of honoring a long standing ceasefire for literally a few days . 
   ukraine is never getting back the lands it lost , ethnic russians are too fucking crazy and numerous there for that to happen . 
  right give up before you 've even made a serious effort . 
  just because ukraine may never get back that territory , or just because getting back that territory might take years or decades . 
  does n't mean you just have to fold and pretend like the annexation did n't happen . 
  the message that sends is that russia can invade a country , annex territory , and the moment they cease active aggression things will go back to normal . 
  what kind of deterrent is that ? 
  i live in new york numb nuts , you do n't need a gun to not be a huge fucking pussy . 
  oh right apologies and taking responsibility only matters if you do it right away . 
  that 's why germany can never , ever , ever , be forgiven for the atrocities committed in ww2 . 
  because they * eventually * took ownership of their crimes , and because every german responsible for atrocities was punished for their crimes . 
  this is real life , you take blame , you provide reparations , you move on . 
  ukraine took responsibility for a tragic mistake , they paid reparations , time to move on . 
  russia is totally unwilling to own up to their mistakes and atrocities and they do their damn best to blame everyone but themselves .
