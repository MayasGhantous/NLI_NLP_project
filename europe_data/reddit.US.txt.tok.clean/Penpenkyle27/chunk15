  it 's not a fringe minority though . 
  it 's a decent chunk of people who are female supremacists or mysandrists . 
  frankly , i think any sex claiming to be better than another is pretty fucking dumb . 
  it 's not only far-right people that are against feminists . 
  many libertarians and moderate liberals are as well, 
  i am neither an mra or a 4channer . 
  i am not an incel . 
  i am simply looking out how self describes feminists are acting . 
  they are ignorant and hateful . 
  i 'm not going to list quotes that some novelist wrote in the 50 's , i 'm looking at how they 're acting today . 
  they have ruined a word , by taking a the word that was a very good thing , and have applied their hateful rhetoric . 
  open your eyes . 
  they 're not freedom fighters . 
  they 're not oppressed . 
  they just want special privileges for being a woman, 
  i like cities , i just do n't like how much power they hold, 
  i 'm not misrepresenting it . 
  definition does not equal practice . 
  they simply took a word that has well meaning , and applied their hateful rhetoric to it, 
  todays feminism is not about equality , but female superiority . 
  woman are equal . 
  no one is disagreeing on that, 
  he was talking about what would be bothersome to most in a mixed marriage, 
  not really european news . . 
  yah but america fucked up so everyone is going to get on the hate bandwagon, 
  it 's not really a question of `` will le pen lose '' but more of a `` how much will she lose '', 
  lots of people do need to get rid of the mentality of `` well they fucked up once , so they *** will *** fuck up again ! '', 
  somethings are accidental , some are not, 
  let 's be real , that 's a guy . 
  also , if he said he hates women , that 's misogynistic . 
  saying you do n't like an ideology is not, 
  religion is part , but i think skin color matters more . 
  if you 're a white catholic frenchman , who would you rather have your daughter marry : a white jew , or a catholic brazilian ? 
  feminism is an ideology . 
  men can be feminist . 
  some women are n't feminists . 
  it 's not misogyny, 
  what does it say ? 
  sorry , do n't speak french, 
  dc is actually majority black, 
  more like al-napoleon muhammod al-qadir, 
  so because someone wanted to change how things are normally done , you think that resorting to violence is acceptable ? 
  how liberal . 
  by the way , it was the dnc who fucked up by choosing hillary over bernie, 
  i 've talked to some people from europe and they say that americans are weirdly friendly and nice . 
  farage has a thing for not liking brussels, 
  everything seems to get downvoted instantly for no reason at all . 
   israel-europe gas deal the memes make themselves, 
  if say california were to somehow rally all californians for secession , it would need to get china and russia on its side to help . 
  america got away because technology was not as advanced , and france , spain and the netherlands helped . 
   catalonia can not legally secede yet their time will come when they become a sovereign nation . 
  that 's completely different . 
  they ( mostly ) speak a different language , and have a history of not being with spain . 
  they 're different cultures . 
  no one considers themselves a `` new yorker '' or `` texan '' before american, 
  well ukip achieved its goal , so of course it would die down . 
  conservatism in germany has been dead ever since wwii . 
  and wilders really only said `` no muslims '' . 
  le pen has more to it than that . 
  when neighborhoods start to change more and more not native , and taxes keep going up , you will see it really start to change . 
  america will never split . 
  it 's completely unrealistic . 
  unless every state tried to leave at the same time , it would n't happen . 
  it 's against the constitution , so things like a referendum wo n't work . 
  it would have to be through military , and even then , america spends the most on military more than every other country combined, 
  people seem to not like it when it 's pointed out that white people are in many places dying faster then they 're being born . 
  and unfiltered immigration is a thing, 
  they 're doing the wrong thing by resorting to violence . 
  do n't silence people with differing opinions . 
  listen , talk and discuss . 
  prove them wrong . 
  by resorting to violence , you are only reinforcing their views and making them look like the better person . 
  probably because they should n't `` put up a fight '' . 
  if you must resort to violence to say something , you 're not worth listening to, 
  kind of . 
  if people elected `` literally hitler '' as president , then i would say no , because that is what they wanted . 
  stereotypes are usually just exaggerated facts, 
  it 'll never get to american levels of integration , but i can see it getting sort of like the holy roman empire, 
  i 'd say canada is more likely to break up than america . 
  quebec almost left in the 90 's , so who 's to say the other provinces would n't want a go on their own ? 
  ^ ^ or ^ ^ join ^ ^ america ? 
  we did try to buy it . 
  but denmark refused, 
  i believe they gave you chocolate too !, 
  [ vera lynn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gvkykeyrnm ) is a really good singer . 
  lots of wwii songs aswell, 
  no , but he would 've lost men that could be used on the eastern front, 
  time to get [ funky ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be8u-zobg_w ), 
  flipping off your local belgian of course, 
  [ it 's widely understood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide_recognition#position_of_the_united_states ) that it was a genocide . 
  it 's by state , not nation in general, 
  that actually makes more sense, 
  bernie was much better socially though , and that counts more than people think it does . 
  hillary looked like a robot , and did n't have a great personality , and i do think that contributed to her loss . 
  at least bill or obama could crack a joke, 
  yah , but they 're not going to the local gun shop and getting the gun the right way, 
  lots are [ unemployed ] ( http://www.dailywire.com/news/13248/study-9-10-antifa-protesters-still-living-moms-aaron-bandler ) though, 
  i 'm going to say it 's 60-40 . 
  i think everyone knows that she 's not going to win , but she 'll still be influential , and show that politics are changing, 
  probably because the right is more for order so the mafia likes that .
