  and when i said anglosphere i meant america , new zealand , australia and canada . 
  the healthcare is just an issue of `` it 's not my problem '', 
   non-american  uses y' all never thought i 'd see the day, 
   boobs maybe  tastier food no doubt . 
  we glorify obesity . 
  it 's fucking disgusting i would love to visit europe but money is a pain . 
  americans are also either super patriotic or they 're pretty anti-american . 
  yah the political spectrum difference in each country is pretty large, 
  legal in about half the states i think, 
  one will the boats arrive ? 
  i 'm saying do n't solely blame one person for what another has done, 
  tbh i would n't really mind going back under a monarchy . 
  government is a bit tougher to corrupt, 
  weed is likely to become legal soon anyway !, 
  by not letting them in ? 
  obama did the same thing with fox . 
  the media has become corrupt on all sides . 
  people do n't want to hear facts , they want to confirm what they already think or know, 
  no / s. 
  homogenous nations do better, 
  why the need to specify trump about the press ? 
  yah europeans seem to get very uppity if someone says a place outside of europe is better ( obviously other places have these , america is no exception , but europe seems to have more ) . 
  i never said america was better anyway . 
  europe does have better things such as public healthcare and public transport . 
  it 's just a little different in america, 
  ukraine , belarus , the balkans in general . 
  most of the former yugoslav states as well . 
  okay ? 
  yes i agree that would be nice . 
  in reality though , nothing is changing . 
  i would 've liked it if the bill that were to keep our data private went through , and i hope that soon it will be private, 
  i 'm talking about the soviet bloc, 
  if it was n't for colonialism , the world would n't be as close together as today . 
  parts of china also let capitalism run free, 
  education system could be improved . 
  it works but there are things to be desired . 
  in 2011 , canada was 80 % white . 
  america is around 60 %, 
  i 'm talking about america , canada , australia , and new zealand, 
  multiculturalism . 
  homogenous societies . 
  do much better . 
  also since our country is relatively old , courruption, 
  how 's the freedom of speech in your country ? 
  every country is good and bad at something, 
  criticism is good and necessary , but like democracy , there are multiple types of communism . 
  you ca n't just put them in one basket, 
  half of europe was a shithole for half a century . 
  do n't pretend your some god amongst men, 
   just east of ~ ~ greece ~ ~ constantinople ftfy, 
  you ca n't put colonialism into one basket . 
  there were good and bad times . 
  it killed innocents , but it helped create a united modern world, 
  how ? 
  it 's not completely fair to say that churchill is the cause of the bengali famine . 
  things could 've been done better , but mind you britain is still sitting next to the reich , and japan had taken burma and was right on the border of bengal, 
  how did he take anything back from the `` western imperialists '' ? 
  parts of china are rich , but other parts look like third world shit holes, 
  a rational communist ? 
  i never thought i 'd see the day . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ? s but i have a question for you : what type of communist do you identify as ? 
  capitalism has down sides of course . 
  but it 's also led to the innovations and inventions we have today, 
  `` hmm how can i make this about the patriarchy '', 
  made fun of the uk ? 
  50 points to you, 
  well you ca n't be a citizen of the eu . 
  * technically * edit since people are n't understanding what i mean : the eu is not a country . 
  you can have an eu passport but you live in your country , not the eu, 
  `` one million deaths is a statistic . 
  one death is a story '' ~ joseph stalin ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ saying ^ ^ ^ ^ stalin ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ good ^ ^ ^ ^ guy . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ thought ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ quote ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ relevant, 
  i do n't think people from somalia * know *, 
  *** bears only ***, 
  we 're too indecisive, 
  poland should leave then . 
  the eu is n't a military pact . 
  nato is . 
  poland would be economically a little worse off but it would be fine, 
  if immigration was controlled and all the immigrants integrated , things like the alt-right would be very small . 
  but when higher-ups are saying things like `` we need to bring in 1 million africans '' people do n't want that . 
  people are as scared as losing their culture as they are their race, 
  the canada one surprised me . 
  the new york one . . 
  it 's new york ... 
  even though the city was n't natural and was created to be very efficient , when you pack more then 8 million people in a city , you 're gon na have some problems, 
  unfortunately , it 's not `` oh no a terrorist attack ! '', 
  it 's `` another one ? '', 
  the second one was a little outlandish . 
  my bad . 
  fixed, 
  for the london attack i 'd say no one did anything because the union jack ca n't be properly displayed on a large monument like say the eiffel tower, 
  saw a few guys with the russian flag out yesterday . 
  glad to see some people remembered, 
  i like how spain is right next to venezuela , colombia , and ecuador, 
   street shrine bit of a tongue twister, 
  someone 's asking for an ass whoopin ' by russia, 
  sort of like how when the london attacks happened , brexit was in the back of peoples mind for one moment ? 
  i get what you mean, 
  you are the type of people that makes this world more bearable ,
