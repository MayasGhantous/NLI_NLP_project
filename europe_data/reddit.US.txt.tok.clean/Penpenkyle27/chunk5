  tim allen is more of a conservative comedian , but he 's alright . 
  i think , * i * *** think *** , jim gaffigan is conservative . 
  he does it good because he 'll slip in right wing jokes , but it 's not just right wing jokes, 
  so like an ` uh ', 
   are getting worse i did n't say they 're bad now, 
  you 're cities are n't as dangerous as ours , but many americans , ( pro-trump people at least ) can see that your cities are getting worse because of the people you 're letting in . 
  you can call me racist , but it most definitely is n't false, 
  i do n't even know if there 's a bias to this . 
  it 's perfect, 
  how do you say that o / ? 
  the posts are starting to become too opinionated . 
  leave that to the comment section, 
  probably because redpanels had actual comics and did n't just throw labels on everything . 
  redpanels was good . 
  wonder why he stopped, 
  probably because your cities are starting to look like ours , and we know that is n't good, 
  tim allen is alright, 
  replace america with cities and you 're going to get a better picture, 
  america could join the commonwealth . 
  or we can make an anglosphere . 
  either one, 
  i do n't think turkey can really do anything, 
  this just in , erdogan declared greece is `` smelly and mean '', 
  you must conform to your stereotype, 
  those tropical fruit , *** pineapples *** ? 
  `` this just in , after a reddit user replaced the union jack , with the flag of the eu , theresa may is now begging the eu to take britain back , citing it was a grave error . '', 
  says the fake country ^ ^ r/finlandconspiracy, 
  i mean , * maybe * , socialism might be possible, 
  i think you mean *** pineapples ***, 
  if he had meant the british isles , he would probably be correct . 
  it 's just that it sounds humorous in my head , a scottish person saying y' all, 
  superpower by 1991, 
  easier to talk to people . 
  you could sound like an intellectual , or you could jus get the point across, 
  i speak freedom ^ ^ / s, 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's based on the continent . 
  the new world learns american english , while the old world learns british english, 
  put the u 's down !, 
  ironically , we actually kept more of the older words , while britain got new ones . 
  i had been lurking on their a bit and they seemed super anti-anglo . 
  any mention of america , and you would see something like `` hate those americans who think they 're irish '' . 
  i get that it 's annoying , but calm down, 
  `` proud of your country ? 
  well fuck you * hitler * ! '', 
  one of the reasons i like this sub is because even though it is obviously left leaning , it does n't ban you for wrongthink, 
   scottish  y' all what, 
  i think it 's also because i speak english . 
  like a quebecois probably will spot france first and a mexican will probably spot spain first . 
  it 's weird because i as an american , always start by looking at britain, 
  oceania : `` please stay away '', 
  whenever i see nzl abbreviated for new zealand , i can never help but think ` naziland ', 
  minorities in general, 
  the only reason that america is known for being racist is because we had to coexist with them . 
  if france or russia had blacks , they would 've had those laws aswell, 
  damn francophones ruined canada, 
  he considered the japs and chinese ` honorary aryans ', 
  obviously this was a dick move . 
  nato countries put their money into a pool to spend . 
  but i get why he 's upset . 
  estonia or any baltic nation does n't pay greece or slovenia for help . 
  you 're right in that it 's really who you surround yourself with . 
  i do n't think 51 % of americans can say a thing about the eu , but americans who do know anything about the eu , would most likely be in favor . 
  i 'm in maryland too so it 's no like i 'm in bumfuck oklahoma . 
  why i say majority though ? 
  i know very many americans who could . 
  the idea of r/pussypass at least was to show how in many situations , women are treated better then men . 
  such as court cases and abuse . 
  it was heavily populated by incels . 
  could be . 
  it 's not american politics , and since everyone in the world already focuses on american politics , many americans do n't know shit about politics in europe, 
  i have n't been on there in a few months, 
  the modern day anglosphere is basically untouchable, 
  climate change denial seems to be a very american thing . 
  i may be wrong , but i have n't heard any big european politicians saying anything about it . 
  probably because america does n't stand to benefit anything under it and it 's actually a loss for us, 
  europe has more history than america which is why i like europe ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ majority ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ americans ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ eu, 
  if they let in a certain number of muslims but it turns out that some countries do n't want them , why should other countries take more ? 
  should n't they just send some back ? 
  of course russia/ussr was shit . 
  i 'm just saying to the guy that i was responding too , is that liberal subs seem to obsess with russia like they do with trump, 
  i 'm not using the word in a negative sense . 
  many posts on here and typically high ranking comments are liberal . 
  in the american sense of the word . 
  if trump was n't against the eu , this sub would still be against him . 
  but it 's not like those annoying subs that hit r/all . 
  trump is mentioned but he is n't the main topic which is why i subscribed, 
  if you stop immigration ( and send a few back ) far right and even many right wing parties will collapse . 
  people are seeing this as a threat to their culture . 
  you 're going to have what the u.s. has : pockets of minorities that have a very high crime rate , very ethnic cities , and conservative suburbs, 
  it 's a liberal sub, 
  is western propaganda !, 
  the 7 years war was more of a world war then ww1, 
  italy , but more france are still iffy, 
  that 's just because you 're a  neo nazi  socialist shill ^ ^ ( pick ^ one ), 
  i feel bad for them . 
  i wish it was just something like a quick chop of the head . 
  i also think that the video might have vegan undertones . 
  but that just seems a little * fishy *, 
  not if those evil nationalists win !, 
  it really depends though .
