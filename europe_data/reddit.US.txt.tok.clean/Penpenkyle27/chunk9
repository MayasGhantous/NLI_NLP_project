  the same one as you buddy . 
  whenever he made a mistake , the mainstream media covered it up or blamed republicans . 
  what ? 
  i think that the leaker is likely a left wing radical . 
  what a better way to fuck with `` le drumpf '' than to leak information on secrets that were given to us by our allies ? 
   long time ago , leftists claimed that children of arabic and black immigrants will 100 % integrate and they 're still doing it today . 
  if he was truly british and hated trump , he would 've tweeted something saying drumpf and attend a rally . 
  that 's not it at all . 
  the problem is islam . 
  the media and most celebrities always go on about #notallmuslims . 
  the problem is islam, 
  `` these people need to stop being violent '' '' ** bigot ** '' not like i expected anything else really, 
   when your government consists of white supremacists we had a black president for 8 years and he was loved . 
  the government is not full of nazi 's . 
  people need to stop believing this shit, 
  it 's about the clicks . 
  why write an honest article , when you can shit out an article on trump eating 2 scoops of ice cream that will get 1000 's of clicks ? 
   uk culture is characterized by being an amalgamation of cultures from all over the world . 
  nope . 
  the british culture is a culture that existed before mass immigration . 
  american , canadian , australian , brazilian and other new world cultures are immigrant cultures, 
  i 've gotten shit for simply having an american flair, 
  for a decent amount of them , they just kind of left, 
   enslaving the natives ? 
  the spanish did that mostly  but what about smallpox blanket people from the 1500 's did n't really know about diseases or how they 're spread, 
  and that 's only 2011 ... 
  they already did ... 
  most liberals : `` we need less white people and more diversity ! '', 
  also liberals : `` why do most white people not like us ? '', 
  sarcasm is not well interpreted over the internet : /, 
  many people would n't agree , but i think european imperialism on africa brought stability . 
  i do n't think it should 've ended so quickly . 
  europe should 've been keeping an eye on africa longer at least, 
  i have a feeling that russia will keep it and a few decades down the line , no one will care, 
   that has always been what we , as a civilization , have had to choose between . 
  20 years ago , we were fine , so it 's obviously possible, 
  well yah , but that would hurt someone 's feelings . 
  how else are white people supposed to get rid of their `` white guilt '' ? 
  when tons of them try to get into europe , then i think europe should intervene in birth rates, 
  no it 's more of `` look at my friend abdul !, 
  he does n't follow islam and his grandfather came here in the 40 's , but he 's totally like a refugee !, 
  and he 's so peaceful ! '', 
  or they just point out rare christian attacks that happened because the person was mentally deranged, 
  i was explaining why people cite `` da joos '' . 
  i never said i agreed with it . 
  what happened to pagans that did n't convert ? 
  they got killed . 
  the guy i was originally replying to asked why people say things happen because of jews . 
  i explained that since jews are a very small percent of the population , but a large part of government and media jobs , people think it 's very weird . 
  i never said i agreed with it . 
  but everyone decided to get their panties in a huge fucking knot, 
   i want to know what mechanism leads people to hold these views i told you . 
  jews have been persecuted in countries for centuries . 
  it makes a lot of sense why conspiracies revolve around them, 
  when jews are only 2 % of the american population and make up a majority in media and are vastly overrepresented in government , you 're going to get people like this, 
  the welfare system is fucked is the problem . 
  are you a single druggie mother in the city with 5 kids and you do n't plan on getting a job ? 
  welfare check !, 
  you have one child and you live alone and you have a college degree and have a job but just need a little money for food ? 
  denied !, 
  i know plenty of nice mexicans and cubans , but they are n't legal and that 's the problem . 
  legal mexicans hate illegal ones, 
   we must study and then work so our guests from the romantic ~ ~ middle east ~ ~ latin america and africa may get their benefits . 
  i guess europe and america are n't too different after all, 
  i think its a good way to put it . 
  i 'm not a neo-nazi , but i am very interested about what happened during and right before wwii , especially germany . 
  how did they know of our plan to send teenage girls to retake the holy land ? 
  99 % of people do n't agree that this is a problem . 
  they say that we 're being `` too intolerant '' . 
  what is the first thing out of most liberals mouths that i always hear right after terrorist attacks `` this hurts muslims more '' the problem is the left is inviting these people in . 
  *** that 's *** the problem, 
   you have regularly inflamed relations with russia . 
  the fact that you 're not doing it right now does not change that . 
  during the cold war we did , but that was to be expected . 
  and if you 're talking about the sanctions places on russia after crimea , i think it was an appropriate response . 
   close allies you get along with are often better than strong allies who are distant , controlling , and politically conflicting with your own . 
  but if that ally is n't that strong either , what 's the real point ? 
  if estonia suddenly gets invaded by russia , who are they going to call first : czechia or america ? 
   that 's recent . 
  nato has existed for a long time . 
  well then do n't say that we were regularly inflaming relations with russia  iraq was when the us enacted article 5 . 
  as someone from the uk , most people here were n't happy about it either . 
  many americans are n't happy about it either . 
  i 'm not happy about it . 
  i think the whole premise of wmd 's was complete bullshit to go and bully iraq . 
   what i mean is that the existence of nato forces european countries to choose between atlantic defence and european defence - they know they ca n't have both , because the two are mutually exclusive . 
  well i would think that if a country wanted good defense , they would choose the nation with the largest army on earth . 
   i 'm not sure that 's true . 
  europe does n't need america . 
  germany , italy , spain , the uk , france , and poland all have powerful militaries , and implicitly protect the surrounding smaller countries . 
  compared to russia though , it 's not really that great . 
  you 're also forgetting about all the weapons we give to europe . 
  if all of it were to disappear , europe would not be in a good position . 
  at this point , i do n't really see why nato still exists . 
  plenty of both americans and europeans do n't want it . 
   regularly inflaming relations with russia trump and putin have decent relations  stationing bases in countries where they are not needed or wanted by the people living there i agree - i think the only bases should be ones in eastern or southern europe  using nato as a channel to expand and hold influence in europe . 
  america already has a strong influence on europe , with or without nato  dragging them into your disputes please name these wars . 
  iraq was only us , britain , poland and australia , a non-nato member . 
   effectively limiting european integration by forcing countries to choose between european military cooperation and atlantic military cooperation . 
  well i see no reason why europe gets to have the benefits of working alone and with america .
