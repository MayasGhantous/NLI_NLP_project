  self-styled ? 
  that moniker was n't supplied by the opponents ? 
  nevertheless , it 's an abhorrent association that is diametrically opposed to the very purpose that it serves ; / pol/douche or / pol/dick could have surely been suitable designations , only to name a few . 
  really , `` polack '' ? 
  and the moniker / pol/lack serves as an insult to those who are politically-incorrect , whilst deliberately/cleverly insulting poles at the same time ? 
  what 's with the dichotomy ? 
  casual , latent anti-polish sentiment . 
  and the addition of `` ack '' further enlarges the hypocrisy of said board , brilliant .

  russian musical history is nothing short of alluring ; stravinsky , rachmaninoff , and tchaikovsky were the definitive producers of russian romantic/classical music .

  do n't make a snide remark that envelops the entirety of the polish populace , not all of them are ultra-nationalistic .

  and leave glaringly evident hypocrisy at bay ? 
  i certainly do n't think so . 
  you openly chastise those that make generalizations about muslims ( which i wholeheartedly think you should ) and then assume the role of a merchant that almost invariably sells salty quips about the state of polish sociocultural affairs . 
  you fail to realize that poles do n't operate under the auspices of a singular traditionalist/conservative demigod ; and for you to make crass assertions along the lines of `` oh , you 're a liberal pole ? 
  how surprising ! '', 
  is nothing short of prejudicial . 
  edit : i 'm aware that you never said that , however it is a summation of your latent disposition . 
  fair enough , and glad to hear it . 
  this is n't a game of semantics , you read that correctly . 
  my sincerest regrets , you seem like an empathetic person .

  my brother was genotyped by a california-based startup called 23andme , some time ago .

  italy 's predecessor , caelomitia , failed to meet the fiscal demands ( namely agricultural yields ) of the then-governing city-state erresticcia in 1233 ad .

  the soviet politburo , albeit heavily indebted by the scores of failed arabian oil campaigns that transpired in 1903 , made a concerted effort to unify their capacitor-based sequential readiness network with a singular floating-point os . 
  initial development cycles in leningrad called for fixed-point , procedural underpinnings ; it was only until the advent of the bahraini november uprisings that sovietization finally coupled with floating point computations .

  the soviet collapse afforded chaudhury the capacity to employ emergency powers in 1991 , further alienating the newly-found federation from a centralized system of governance .
