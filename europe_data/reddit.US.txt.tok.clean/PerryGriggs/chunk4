  okay , you do n't know shit . 
   the us arrived in late 1943 1941 , and 1942 when we did serious combat . 
   its you who do n't know anything about wwii in europe when you try and make it sound like you arrived early and fought for the majority of the war . 
  you arrived when the war was already won and there only was the mop up job to be done . 
  bullshit , you 're so full of horseshit it 's hilarious . 
  the allies killed & captured more germans than the soviets , saying that we only arrived for a mop up shows you have a very poor education in ww2 . 
  oh , and easy company has to talk about the british * all the time * , otherwise they think america is doing everything . 
  for sure , but no , * i 'm * the butturt one , what with my facts and sources and shit . 
   the major operations like d-day and especially operation market garden which were primarily a british operation http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35aswe/survey_in_france_what_is_according_to_you_the/cr2vvfj that 's some historical revisionism to me , and frankly it 's disgusting . 
  except that is n't what you said , you said it was a primarily british operation , that 's wrong . 
  you 're just throwing butthurt around because you were * wrong * . 
   no i 'm not . 
  i am saying that when you kill 80 % of the enemy forces , you contribute more to the victory . 
  so , in other words , your argument from before is wrong then ? 
   that because less british died taking their objectives , what they did that day was somehow less worth ? 
  alrighty . 
   i called you a ego nut because you started talking about what americans thought when it is n't about what you think , but about what the french think . 
  i corrected what you said , and now suddenly i 'm talking about what the americans think ? 
  get over yourself . 
   even if the us only had been in the pacific fighting the japs , the soviet union would still have beat germany . 
  obviously , and i never claimed otherwise . 
   band of brothers . 
  band of brothers in no way attempts to claim that the us did everything , and if that 's what you got from it , you did n't pay attention . 
   the major operations like d-day and especially operation market garden which were primarily a british operation , were all american . 
  d-day was n't primarily a british operation , i have no idea how you came to that conclusion . 
   the commonwealth are mentioned but that 's about it . 
  wow , in a miniseries that follows one very small unit through the war , they only mention the commonwealth ? 
  not to mention , in the market garden scenes , they show british forces . 
   its not a contest , so i do n't care . 
  the point i was making there is that just because you 've seen a lot of american movies/tv shows , to claim that that 's all we show is dumb . 
   and that 's why the british are barely mentioned ? 
  okay ... 
  considering they focus on the american beaches , why would they mention the british ? 
  i do n't expect british movies about the landings on gold to mention us a bunch , because that 's not the focus . 
   oh , i 'm so sorry . 
  you were there 3 months before 1944 , in september 1943 . 
  that makes a whole lot of difference ... three months is a lot in war , so yeah , it does make a difference . 
  does n't change you still being wrong though . 
   i can give you a very , very long list of historians that agree stalingrad was the turning . 
  congratulations , i can give you a long list of historians that say otherwise . 
   your attempt at historical revisionism is quite frankly untasteful . 
  you 're doing the most historical revisionism here , with the debates about the beaches and all . 
  you 're show you do n't know much about ww2 if you 're going to keep claiming that the us only arrived at the end . 
  nobody here is arguing that the us `` literally did everything '' , the topic was about omaha and utah , and he was factually * wrong * . 
  after he gets proven wrong , he then tries to spin it into `` but soviet union did more anyway '' , meaning he does n't want to admit the us contributed much , therefor belittling the contribution the us gave . 
  i can see i wo n't be changing your opinion , so there is n't much point in continuing . 
  however , you seem to think i 've been trying to give the us more credit than the soviet union , so you either have n't been reading anything i 've typed , or you just like painting everyone under the same brush . 
  yeah , the `` funnies '' ( i 'll never get used to saying that ) certainly would have helped lessen the casualties . 
   i thought the higher losses were more due to us refusal to use british ` funnies ' tanks etc rather than the beaches being harder yes , it contributed to the casualties , but what you said here sounds like you 're discounting the main reason for the casualties , the heavier defenses . 
   that because less british died taking their objectives , what they did that day was somehow less worth ? 
  i 'm using the exact same argument most people use for the soviets . 
  they think that losses/kills means the most contribution . 
  you 're guilty of doing this too . 
   believe it or not , but this is n't about you , you ego nut . 
  nice , i just love when someone throws random insults at me for no legitimate reason . 
   this is about the perception that america contributed more to the defeat of nazi germany than the soviet union which in no way is correct . 
  of course it is n't , what you and most other people here do n't seem to realize , it was a team effort , and without one the others most likely would n't have been able to win . 
   i suggest that it might be because of the portrayal in many american movies and tv-series that show mostly america doing all the work . 
  examples ? 
   believe it or not , but we here in europe watch an awfully lot of american movies and series . 
  sure , but i think an american ( like me ) watches more of it than you do . 
   but i am going to say that you are flat out wrong if you are trying to make it sound like you did as much of the heavy fighting as the soviet union . 
  i 'm not , i was simply clarifying the reason for the us focus in movies is because of the ferocity of combat on omaha and utah . 
   but the first us troops set first foot in europe in 1944 wrong , [ this is what gives me the impression that you do n't know as much on the subject as you think you do . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_invasion_of_italy )  which all historians agree were the turning point in wwii . 
  last i heard on that , most historians think that there was no clearly defined turning point , it was n't any single event , it was a combination of things . 
  yeah , this is n't a good showing by / r/europe . 
  downvoting posts with sources and upvoting shit that is made up on the spot . 
   but the war in the european war theater was almost over when america entered it . 
  80 % of the german casualties happened on the eastern front . 
  remember how i talked about you trying to belittle the american contribution ? 
  yeah , that 's exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  nope , it was because of the heavier defenses in place there . 
  omaha had an entire division defending it , unlike the regiments that defended the other beaches . 
  you debating that the us took the most heavily defended beach and took the most casualties . 
  saying that since the commonwealth took 3 beaches instead of just 2 means they compensated for taking relatively low casualties . 
  saying the only reason we see so much about utah and omaha is because us americans only watch movies about ourselves . 
  the rest of your comments here are also pretty much the same thing , you may not be trying to belittle the us contribution , but it sure sounds like it . 
  this is a direct quote from you  lets for example take d-day . 
  many people think that mainly was an american operation . 
  well , it was n't . 
  that and everything below that is trying to belittle the us contribution , and when i point out you 're wrong in regards to the most heavily defended beach , you go `` stop being butthurt and stop belittling what the british did '' . 
  alrighty then . 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omaha_beach ) [ compare ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juno_beach ) the [ casualties ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gold_beach ) before [ you ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sword_beach ) go [ claiming ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/utah_beach ) otherwise . 
  they took the most heavily defended beach and took the most casualties on that beach , but you 're focusing on the number of beaches . 
  alright , so you 're just out to shit on america then . 
  overlord : the d-day landings . 
  [ i ca n't pull up anything directly besides this , but the very first sentence for omaha is from the book , you can look in the sources on the page . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normandy_landings#omaha_beach ), 
  the us took the beaches with the heaviest defences , that 's why it 's focused on so much . 
  obviously there is more to it than numbers , but if the us outnumbered the germans , then we 'd have nearly every advantage . 
   which was the reason german americans didnt get camped in the first place . 
  same with italian americans . 
  no , the reason is that the views on them had changed since the first world war . 
  in ww1 , we discriminated against german-americans because we did n't consider them true americans , that mentality had completely changed by the time ww2 rolled around . 
   you have had to close new york if you kicked all the germans/italian americans out . 
  literal impossibility . 
  you 're right , it is impossible ... because we would never do that to begin with . 
  it really is , it was considered part of the war , so they would definitely support it .
