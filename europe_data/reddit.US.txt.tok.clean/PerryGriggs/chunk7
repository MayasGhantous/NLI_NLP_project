   still , soldiers do n't fix potholes or do anything else to raise a standard of living . 
  they do , actually . 
  the army corps of engineers build roads and stuff for civilians all the time . 
  jesus christ , you are really speaking out of your ass here . 
  the f-35 was never designed with the idea of replacing the f-22 . 
  it would n't be able to , it does n't have the same capabilities that the f-22 has . 
  they 're not `` crappy '' either . 
   and in the us , oh there 's billions lost in crappy new fighter jets that ca n't even fly in rain . 
  you just went and showed that you have no idea what you 're talking about there . 
  i really do appreciate the long reply , but you and pretty much everyone here either did n't understand me or did n't care . 
  i never once claimed the wars that the us has had were on the same level as the wars in europe , he made the claim that most us states have n't seen war , and that 's false . 
  you really do n't need to give me that stuff about understanding history and such , considering how big into history i am , i really do get it . 
  [ this covers another good chunk of states . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexican%e2%80%93american_war ), 
  sure , but just because they 're broke now does n't mean they 'll always be . 
   that 's something that should be a concern of the eu not us . 
  i think we should be just as concerned as the eu is , i do n't think it should be all us , but we should still be making commitments . 
  actually fairly soon , going into the army . 
  hopefully going airborne too . 
   and please tell me more about this world war that would break out if not for ` murica ? 
  if the us backed out of our obligations to security in the world , you can bet your ass russia would be more aggressive towards the eastern european nations . 
   the only states that seen any sort of a more serious war were the eastern ones and the western ones just sat there without any action ever . 
  [ i dunno , seems like more than just the eastern states fought in the civil war . 
  ] ( http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/bystate.htm )  sure you might say they had to fight with the indians but let 's be real here , there was never any real threat to any of you from a bunch of men with bows and axes when you had gatling guns and lever action rifles i 'm not claiming that they were a serious threat , just that your `` most us states have n't seen war '' is a bit of an extreme statement to make . 
  even then , i 'd say there 's still lots of interesting history . 
  it 's all a matter of preference of course . 
  i resent that , the midwest has lots of interesting history , maybe not to you , but to a lot of people it does . 
   while most of your us states never even seen war in their entire existence that guy 's an asshole , but [ what ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_revolutionary_war ) you [ said ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_1812 ) there [ is n't ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_indian_wars ) really [ true ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_war ) . 
  sure , there were only really two that matched the scale of most european wars , but to say that us states have n't seen war is a bit much . 
  no , it 's still useful against a modern military . 
  useless is a bit of a strong word , they 're still useful . 
  do n't worry about that guy , he 's in the minority of people in the us , and he 's also a bit , uh , * idealistic * about isolationism . 
  we got yo back eurobros !, 
  what foreign flag are you under ? 
  the main issue with the ukrainian army is n't one of size , it 's of corruption and training . 
  second one is more ignorance . 
  you also did n't even read your own comment . 
  let me quote for you . 
   i 'm more than a few replies into this thread and it all seems right to me . 
  so , what you 're saying is , everybody i linked to were n't ignorant in some form ? 
  k.  you may be the person ignorant about america if you think the posts i 've seen are mostly factually incorrect . 
  sure , the guy living in america is ignorant about america , but all these europeans saying `` super corrupt ! '', 
  and `` police will beat and kill you for lols . '', 
  are correct ? 
  if you say yes , i 'm pretty fucking positive you 're the ignorant one . 
  also , thanks for being a dickhead , you did n't have to be , but you were . 
  good job . 
  [ really ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30sj16/hey_reurope_would_you_emigrate_to_the_us_if_you/cpvymnu ) now ? 
  [ you ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30sj16/hey_reurope_would_you_emigrate_to_the_us_if_you/cpvicwt ) have n't [ seen ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30sj16/hey_reurope_would_you_emigrate_to_the_us_if_you/cpvdxa0 ) ignorance here ? 
  [ this guys explains it well ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30sj16/hey_reurope_would_you_emigrate_to_the_us_if_you/cpvys92 ), 
  that would be an amazing movie . 
  i 'd pay to watch that . 
  yeah , sorry for not wording it better , my fault . 
  stockpiles and such are always the main blocking force for adopting a new cartridge . 
  that 's why the m1 garand got re chambered into 30-06 when its original cartridge was .276 pederson . 
  i would n't really agree with that , but ok . 
  yeah , the ignorance is intertwined with the legit reasons though . 
  yeah , that 's what i was meaning . 
  since romania does n't use a rifle with a nato standard cartridge , if they got the beryl they would then be able to tap into nato supply lines for ammo . 
  the only reason i can tell is that it 's under development , so it 's not really available in any sort of bulk . 
  once it 's done , i guess cost would be the issue then . 
  itt : ignorance about america . 
  alright , one aspect the beryl is far far better than the pa md. 
  86 is logistics . 
  the beryl can use the old soviet round , 5.45 x39mm , but more importantly , it can use 5.56 x45mm nato . 
  that means you can have the ability to swap magazines with an american , or a german ( do broomsticks take nato mags ? 
  ) , or whatever nato soldier you 're fighting with . 
  another big advantage that the beryl has , picatinny rails . 
  that means you can tacticool the shit out of your rifle . 
  in all seriousness though , rails like that are essential in modern small arms design , it gives the user the ability to customize the rifle to fit their needs . 
  that was just me skimming over it , i might be able to dig more up if you want . 
  welcome to the party , booze is on the right , gay homosex nazis on your left . 
  no , but he 's wrong about it being 100 % our fault . 
  it was a joint operation with the british . 
  [ that 's ] ( http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141845/mary-elise-sarotte/a-broken-promise ) not [ what ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2014/11/23/commentary/world-commentary/russia-remakes-history-natos-eastern-expansion/#.vrgxcvnf8sy ) i 've [ read . 
  ] ( http://dialogueeurope.org/uploads/file/resources/twq%20article%20on%20germany%20and%20nato.pdf ), 
  i do n't know man , the us and russia had close ties before the russian civil war . 
  not to mention , a lot of european countries that hated each other in the past are now close allies . 
  i was meaning more along the lines of them not having to `` let go '' of ukraine , the west and russia do n't have to be enemies . 
   you seem to be the `` butthurt american '' intent on defending the u.s. 
  calm down . 
  you 're making stupid claims , and i 'm the butthurt american for correcting them ? 
   wars requires tons of supplies to fight , and the u.s. could provide them . 
  you realize europe has their own arms industries , right ? 
   does n't everyone say that is was wwii that brought the u.s. out of the great depression ? 
  that 's because we switched all factories into wartime production , and pretty much everyone contributed to the war effort . 
  it was n't due to trade , seeing as we gave most of the stuff away for free . 
  sure , but that 's why we should n't be acting like russia is the ussr , they simply are n't on the same power level . 
  if russia wanted to be treated as an equal , they could 've just not fucked with ukraine . 
  the problem with that is they suffered the problem the us did after the cold war . 
  the nukes went into disrepair , and a good amount of them are n't being maintained to the right standard today . 
  what . 
  no , seriously , what ? 
  do you realize how fucking stupid that is ? 
  trade would n't increase if there 's a goddamned war on the continent . 
  why would you think there 'd be more trade than there is now if there was a war ? 
   so , the u.s. could have blocked membership . 
  why would the us do that ? 
   the u.s. promised gorbachev that they would n't expand , and went and did it anyway . 
  no , we did n't .
