  [ gorbachev himself said there was no promise . 
  ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/11/06-nato-no-promise-enlarge-gorbachev-pifer ), 
   russia 's back in business except they really are n't , their military is outdated , and their economy ca n't go toe to toe with the west anymore . 
  hell , with logistical help from the us , i think the eu could take on the russian military . 
  obviously , and i never claimed we should n't . 
  i was talking about how we get all the blame for iran , when it was a joint operation with the british . 
  they got off pretty goddamned lightly , seeing as most everyone pins that on the us now . 
  the us earns more money from a peaceful europe through trade , not to mention , the arms companies you 're talking about get money through deals with europeans . 
   thats the thing , even after the ussr fell , russia retained a huge amount of territory , man power and thousands of nuclear warheads ( lets face it , that matters ) . 
  sure , but they were in disarray , and their military in shambles . 
  hardly something that can claim or maintain a sphere of influence . 
  jesus christ , you 're an asshole . 
  sure , all those people * who can think and act for themselves * are 100 % colonies of the us . 
  you disrespected all those people who chose to be an ally of the us , they have free will , they 're human goddamn beings . 
   russia will always have a its own sphere of influence . 
  empires rise and fall , they do n't `` always '' have a sphere of influence . 
   the us simply took advantage of their weakness after the fall of the ussr and expanded nato as far as possible . 
  the us did n't `` expand '' nato , the countries that joined knew what they were doing , and did it willingly . 
   sure , countries arent forced to join so , blame the us for the actions of others ? 
   but russia undeniably sees this a threat . 
  obviously , and i do n't blame them for seeing it as a threat . 
   and here we have the clash the of interests , culminating in the recent ukranian crisis . 
  the ukrainian crisis is more of a clash of eu and russian interests , not the us . 
  we got dragged into this . 
   whats happening there right now is wrong on a moral basis , but sadly fairly logical from a geo-political view . 
  how is it wrong on a moral basis ? 
  the ukrainians have been fighting russian equipped rebels/russians , after taking land from the ukrainians , and all the west has done is help train and supply ukraine . 
  sure , the us definitely abuses poland and the czech republic , yep . 
  stop being an over dramatic dickhole . 
   i do n't think the us wants to maintain peace why the fuck would you think that ? 
  the us benefits from a peaceful europe , why would we want conflict in europe ? 
   after they brought down a democratically elected leader in iran and chile i love how we always get all the blame for iran . 
  also , 100 % comparable to europe , yep . 
   or after they started completely nonsensical wars like in vietnam or iraq . 
  for vietnam at least , it was n't nonsensical at the time . 
  they 're not under any other sphere of influence that i can see , so what 's the problem ? 
  how could we protect those under the soviet sphere of influence ? 
  the raptor was n't designed for dogfighting , you 'll be hard pressed to find an aircraft designed for dogfighting today . 
  the point of the raptor is that it can kill you before you know it 's there , because of the stealth + bvr capability . 
  the f-35 has some of the stealth with that bvr capability , meaning it should n't have to dogfight . 
  shit , if a us pilot gets into a dogfight , they fucked up . 
   the a-10 for close air support it is though , most multi-role fighters are . 
  that 's why in afghanistan , the us uses more f-16s for cas than a-10s . 
   probably a tad more advanced a tad ? 
  i 'd say more , but hey , that 's just me . 
   for air superiority you 're better of with the ef i would n't really agree with that , seeing as the f-35 has limited stealth capabilities , and a more advanced avionics suite . 
  combine that with the us emphasis on bvr engagements with things like the amraam , i 'd say they 're at least very close in air superiority capability . 
  also , we keep running into each other today . 
  how so ? 
  that looks pretty cool , i thought [ only ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_p-38_lightning ) america did [ those ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northrop_p-61_black_widow ) types of designs . 
  the image you linked says nothing about its capability vs the f-35 . 
  very true , i know that [ you guys at least ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fennek ) help [ design ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boxer_ ( armoured_fighting_vehicle ) some [ badass vehicles . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_martin_f-35_lightning_ii ), 
  [ not according to saab . 
  the price will go way down the more it 's produced , so in the long term , price wont be an issue . 
  as for eight f-16s vs one f-35 , well , you do n't really gain the same capability with the f-16 . 
  that kinda look like a [ ba-10 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ba-10 ), 
  even with smart weaponry , hitting civilians will be a problem , especially with explosives . 
  turns out explosives are rather big . 
  i would n't expect a dutchie to know true tonk beauty . 
  that depends on the type of artillery . 
  mlrs , for example , saturates a large area with big as fuck rockets \u2122 , it has the ability to fire more accurate types , but that 's not the main goal . 
  your conventional artillery , things like howitzers , can be used in defensive or offensive engagements , but they do have a moderate circle of impact . 
  there are smart shells being developed for them , things like the [ excalibur ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m982_excalibur ) but they 're somewhat far off from replacing conventional artillery shells . 
  leclerc of worst mbt . 
  [ this is best looking mbt . 
  ah , there it is . 
  i was waiting for someone to swing it back to `` nop still bettr than u '' . 
  real life . 
  they do , the su-27 . 
  the f-15 is n't being phased out at all , it 's still a very capable fighter . 
  furthermore , the usaf knew that the a-10 would be shot down in a conventional warfare situation , that 's why they expected that all a-10s would be wiped out in the first two weeks if the soviets invaded . 
  edit : a word . 
  yes , i have an american flair . 
  no , you can do it , just not complain about other people doing it . 
  you 're really going for that victim card here . 
  sure , but you ca n't really complain about other people doing it then . 
   but everyone else has already decided on a verdict . 
  kind of like what you did , no ? 
   edit : holy shit i need to get laid :| yep . 
   the pilot found no pleasure in his actions we do n't really know that , for all we know he could be a sick fuck that wanted to do that . 
   limiting defense spending to what is actually needed ? 
  i would say they 've been lowered more than they should . 
   keeping up an overblown military in a world where no possible opponents exist . 
  i 'm guessing you 're western european , i highly doubt you 'd be thinking that if you were closer to russia . 
  i would n't call the pt-91 junk . 
  sure , it may not be best of the best , but it 's better than what a lot of other countries have . 
  i 'm fine with discussing the issue , but that 's all you fucking do . 
  do you ever contribute anything besides that ? 
  i 'm getting mixed signals right now . 
  jesus christ , we get it . 
  do you ever contribute anything else to / r/europe besides `` fuck you yurop , we do n't need you anymore ! '' . 
  god damn , give it a rest . 
   americans wear their shoes indoors . 
  that varies wildly , most people i know do n't wear shoes indoors . 
  i do , i do n't give a fuck . 
  these serbs are a special level of butthurt . 
  nah , it 's all good . 
  we 're used to it by now .
