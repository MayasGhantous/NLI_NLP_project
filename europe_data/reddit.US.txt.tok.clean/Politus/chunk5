  he was n't overthrown by a violent coup . 
  he signed a deal granting some reforms and then proceeded to flee the country on his own , very much not at gunpoint . 
  oh man , they blow . 
  and rand paul wants us to completely separate from the world stage and abandon the working class to objectivist mammon , but his critique of the american security apparatus is no less striking and no less important to hear . 
  ukip wants to leave the eu , but the reasons they give are important to hear and it 's important to have farage as a prominent ** opposition voice ** . 
  that 's not to say `` give him the keys to the car '' but respect the position he has , and treat him like you would any other party that is working within the euro system . 
  resorting to the sort of un-democratic back-door dealings farage and others have openly criticized in order to suppress farage is playing into his hands and proving his point . 
  it 's a shame really , because it 's important to have opposition figures like farage in visible , influential positions - it keeps the mainline honest . 
  even if you disagree with some of what farage says , a lot of his critiques are cogent and on the mark .

  guys i 'm sure there 's a totally rational explanation . 
  this tatar is probably a nazi homogay jew american shill , like poroshenko and the govt in kiev and mustafa cemilev . 
  truth . 
  i think the bulgarians are just happy to be included in * someone 's * - anyone 's - propaganda at this point . 
  that 's why russia has such a high standard of living . 
  i think that part of the issue that europe faces is an attempt at economic unity without bureaucratic standards to facilitate it . 
  greece was brought into the eu with decades of deeply-rooted corruption inherent in its system , making a crisis like the one at present inevitable . 
  economic development is easy , relatively speaking - it just takes a lot of investment . 
  the problem is dealing with entrenched systems of graft and inefficiency which drag the whole system down . 
  it 's like trying to tack on a new section to the boat , but the new section has holes in the side . 
  sure , you can keep bailing out the water but unless you patch the holes the whole ship will sink . 
  part of the problem europe faces is an economic union which necessarily ties together these nations and makes them dependent on each other , but also leaves them politically and bureaucratically independent enough to hang themselves - which would be fine if they were n't now integral facets of the overall european community , making their failure a threat to the success of all the other nations . 
  well then , he should get along well with certain elements of hungary 's right . 
   i do n't see how the ** west ** germans have any obligation to share the wealth and welfare they created for themselves through hard work , paying taxes and contributing to a relatively non-corrupt political system . 
  there , i think that 's what you meant . 
  americans like to joke that lapsed catholics are the largest denomination in america - catholics who nominally believe , but do n't really go to church if at all ( maybe on christmas and easter ) . 
  that 's actually common for a lot of american christians , especially youth . 
  you can still believe in islam without really doing much about it . 
  i 'm not british i 'm american . 
  apples and oranges . 
  the germans participated in subjugation of the boxer rebellion , and also participated in colonization including explicit genocide against the herero and namaqua . 
  the british were among the first to ban the slave trade , mind you . 
  the big difference between the two , of course , was that britain did n't spend a decade preparing for , and engaging in , a bloody war of conquest against all of europe involving widespread industrialized genocide and mass murder of jews , slavs , gypsies , homosexuals , political dissidents , etc.

  what you have to understand about american two-party politics is that both parties incorporate diverse viewpoints . 
  the republicans encompass a wide range of groups , from establishment republicans like boehner to the tea party/libertarian wing best represented by rand paul . 
  similarly , the democratic party is incredibly diverse with different factions ranging from populist , leftist , to more conventional center-left establishment sorts . 
  historically , there was a period of american politics in the early 19th century after jefferson 's presidency where the democratic republicans ( the precursors to the democratic party ) held a virtual monopoly on politics , but the broad coalition collapsed with the argument over who would succeed james monroe , resulting in the emergence of the democratic party and the national republicans , who would merge with the whigs . 
  what i 'm saying , i suppose , is that the american party system has reinvented itself several times . 
  the names have been fairly constant for the past century and a half , but the actual doctrines , voter-bases , and policies have changed significantly . 
  if the democrats - or republicans - ever got to a point where they held unquestioned dominance , the party would splinter and reform in new ways . 
  this was the most entertaining thing i 've read all day . 
  also the saddest . 
  i hope things turn out better for bulgaria .

  wait , * what * ? 
  first of all , early jazz was a black thing - it was n't in `` most arenas of public life '' . 
  as early jazz became jazz , it was uniquely black - and not beholden to the cultural expectations of whites . 
  that 's one of the reasons it was so transgressive . 
  secondly , `` anglo '' is n't a culture ; even within the confines of american white people , especially in the late 19th/early 20th centuries , there was a huge degree of regional variation and peculiarity to the cultures of america . 
  the southeast was different from the northeast , which was different from the midwest and the southwest , etc. 
  thirdly , the evolution of jazz was a product of many culturally diverse musical traditions ; you have the musical traditions brought over from africa with the slaves , which emerged in jazz particularly through rhythmic idiosyncrasies ; you have the introduction of afro-cuban musical influence through travel between havana and new orleans ; you have negro spirituals , which fused extant traditions of christian church music with african musical styles ; on top of all this , you have the afro-creole musical tradition which arose in louisiana , particularly new orleans , which was 100 % not anglo . 
  all of these different , and most importantly , ** culturally varied ** , musical influences - and more , i 'm simplifying some of them - came together to create what we know as jazz . 
  it was inherently a product of cultural fusion . 
  new orleans , the literal ** home of jazz ** , was the site of cultural crossover and mixing between french , english , african and latin cultural and musical traditions , which is what led to jazz being what it was . 
  moreover , japan is ethnically homogeneous , but culture is not static . 
  japanese culture has changed significantly over centuries ; 20th century post-war japan would be in many ways culturally unrecognizable even to the japanese at the beginning of the 20th century , much less to japanese in earlier epochs . 
  cultural interchange prompts and accelerates cultural evolution which happens even without interchange . 
   and as for culture , cultures have comingled and shared before multiculturalism . 
  japan has jazz and metal . 
  japan is homogeneous . 
  it 's like you do n't understand the history of music at all . 
  japan has jazz as a consequence of cultural exchange between america and japan . 
  in america , jazz arose as a product of black culture and its interaction with extant musical traditions . 
  you 're using the fact that japan imported a product of american multiculturalism as an argument against american multiculturalism . 
  i 'll get to the rest later , but really , you have no idea what you 're talking about - especially when it comes to american history . 
  why should it ? 
  america 's diversity is my favorite part about it . 
  i love that i can go into the city and have my pick of great ethiopian food , korean barbecue , high-quality sushi , whatever . 
  hell , even in my shitty corner of rural new york i have great mexican , japanese , and middle eastern food within a short drive . 
  when i go down south for uni , i have some of the best soul food in america available at this one restaurant that an old black woman built up from pennies over the years . 
  growing up in brooklyn , there was this one 5-block stretch a few streets over from me that had polish grocery stores , pakistani restaurants , hole-in-the-wall falafel joints . 
  i could go get kickass tandoori chicken so spicy it would melt your face off , then go to the polish grocer and pick any number of tasty , fresh pickles , from a literal wall of pickle barrels , to snack on at home . 
  my favorite comics are black , my favorite actors are jews , my favorite musicians are white , but are inspired by a musical tradition that 's a tapestry of different cultures and beliefs . 
  my favorite foods came here with immigrants from the same areas now `` invading '' europe .
