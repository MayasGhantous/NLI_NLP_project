but that is completely unrelated to my points . 
  i 'm not going to start arguing the meaning of the word relevant now . 
   is this not true ? 
  you say historical definitions do n't exist , but groups like mother jones and the us congressional research service ( just two that i know of ) completely disagree with you . 
  * mother jones : 2012 * ( updated definition in 2016 ) * mass shooting tracker : 2012 * fbi active shooter : 2013 * gun violence archive : 2014 * congressional research center report : 2015 ( specifically says definition only applies to report ) * vice : 2016 no there is no historical definition of mass shooting . 
  and actually i just looked at mother jones database , and they 've * removed their official definition * . 
  it used to be 4 + killed , minus domestic and gang violence , had to be in public place , only one shooter , plus `` spree killings '' which they never defined . 
  but that 's all been removed , for a vague 4 + killed minus `` conventional crimes '' but never really fully define what 's conventional . 
  but they were making exceptions for shootings all the time like for columbine and san bernardino ( two shooters ) . 
  the mother jones list is more accurately described as whatever mark follman feels like . 
  plus after getting a ton of flack from data scientists i guess he felt he needed to add this line : '' ... larger datasets of multiple-victim shootings may be useful for studying the broader problem of gun violence ... '' the irony here is the mother jones definition is very ambiguous , massively deflates fbi mass killing numbers , and is the biggest deviation from the fbi 's definition of mass killing of all the definitions , but yet you accept those numbers uncritically , with no examination . 
   is this not true ? 
  this speaks to the motivations of the coiners of the new definition . 
  no it 's not true . 
  but apparently you 're psychic and can tell others what their motivations are . 
  the motivations were to find out exactly how many mass shootings we really have , and it turns out a lot due to the vast majority go under reported because 85 % of people survive . 
   this is more tangential about the motives of the mass shooting trackers , but is it also not true ? 
  the * only * database that tried to take into account the motivations of the shooter is mother jones . 
  not the fbi , not gva , not mst , not the congressional research center , not vice . 
  and mother jones seems to have changed from the shooter 's intent to type of crime , * but they have n't actually updated their data * . 
  so really you get a 0.5 out of 5 definitions here . 
  you entire argument is wrong . 
  and this is why :  * killing : an instance of someone being kill we 're talking about ** shootings ** not killings . 
  the most ridiculous thing in this entire argument is the how people like you do n't understand a fact a 5 year old can understand ( assuming you 'd ask them such a grim question ) - the difference between a shooting and a killing . 
  not all killings are shootings and 85 % of the americans who are shot are n't killed . 
  the difference in these terms could n't be more stark or obvious , yet you use treat them like they are interchangeable . 
  they are not , and in no way could you argue they are . 
  there is no historical definition of mass shooting . 
  mass killings according to the fbi include 4 or more people ** killed with knives , poison , blunt objects , etc ** . 
  it 's not even solely a firearm statistic . 
  so when the fbi changed their definition of mass killing from 4 to 3 people in 2014 , are they pushing an agenda as well ? 
  when they include mass killings by knife , are they inflating a statistic ? 
  you 're holding up this definition like it 's gospel , * and you have n't the slightest clue what it even is !, 
  * every single one of your points is objectively false . 
   up front , i 'll say i 'm an american and hugely in favor of gun rights . 
  but of course it 's everyone * else * that 's biased , not you right ? 
  a mass shooting is considered anytime 4 or more people are shot by a firearm in one or more locations without a cooling off period . 
  a ** shooting ** is any injury caused by a projectile ( cdc definition ) . 
  the cdc includes firearms , pellet guns , arrows , slingshots , spud guns , literally anything that fires a projectile . 
  they do n't care about intent , for even if it was a direct shot . 
  all they care about is the injury . 
  ( obviously the cdc has been pushing a liberal political agenda for decades ! ), 
  for the purposes of these trackers , only firearms are used . 
  a ** mass ** of people is considered 4 . 
  this was originally chosen by the fbi , yet another super liberal organization which as been pushing a political agenda for decades !, 
  when many of these trackers started the fbi considered 4 or more people * killed * as a mass killing . 
  the fbi includes poisonings , knifings , etc when tracking mass * killings * . 
  these trackers are concerned only about firearms ( because poison and knives are n't projectiles ) . 
  the trackers are also interested in non-fatal injuries as well as fatal injuries . 
  ( the cdc tracks both fatal and non-fatal . 
  i know dirty fucking liberals ! ), 
  admittedly the number 4 is a bit arbitrary , but 2 or 3 is also just as valid as well , but it 's what the fbi used , and everyone standardized on it . 
  but since many of these trackers started , the fbi dropped their definition of mass * killing * to 3 . 
  the trackers all stayed at 4 for consistency and also resource constraints . 
  tracking 3 or more people shot is a lot more work than 4 or more . 
  finally the ** cooling off period ** is used to distinguish between a mass shooting or serial shooting . 
  a single person who shoots 4 or more people is one of those two . 
  this is borrowed from the fbi which uses this to distinguish between mass and serial killers . 
  so if someone negligently discharges their firearm in the presence of enough people that 4 are injured , it 's a mass shooting . 
  you can call it a negligent mass shooting , but it 's still a mass shooting . 
  i mean you have to be an extra kind of irresponsible to not take care of your firearm when you 're in or around a crowd of people . 
  and for those wondering , negligent mass shootings are rare ( something like 3 out of 1000 ) . 
  trying to use one of these rare incidences to discredit 1100 other shootings is intellectually dishonest , and a pretty solid sign that someone is clearly pushing their own agenda . 
  my facts are correct . 
  of course european laws vary greatly ( hence the plural `` standards '' not singular `` standard '' ) , but they are all significantly more strict than the us , even switzerland . 
  you do realize that in / r/europe , grc is normal , in fact i 'd say most of us advocate gun laws in america that would just start to bring it up to the standards in europe . 
  personally i 'd be a major step forward if we implemented a swiss-like model in the u.s. 
  but that 's considered an ` extreme ' position by someone like you . 
  here , you 're the extremist . 
  in fact , you are anywhere outside of the us . 
  and unlike op , or the leading progun researcher [ john lott ] ( http://www.armedwithreason.com/shooting-down-the-gun-lobbys-favorite-academic-a-lott-of-lies/ ) , i 've never been caught intentionally misrepresenting myself . 
  so i got that going for me . 
   i agree with this , and even though it 's shown op misrepresents himself , i 'm going to defend him . 
  the burden of proof is on him , and any critically thinking person would question the person caught lying , not defend him . 
  spare me the lectures on bias and go look in a mirror . 
  for the record this conveniently omits mandatory military training everyone goes through , so further training requirements for firearms are unnecessary and goes far beyond the training required almost anywhere else . 
  it also bares false his claim about no relationship between military and personal use when everyone is trained by the military . 
  he also leaves out the fact that this is true for basically the easiest ( and one of the more rural ) cantons , not statewide . 
  thier background check system is also far more maintained and comprehensive that the u.s. 
  they also register and track all firearms at the federal level . 
  switzerland also benefits from its neighbors regulating firearms more than they do , so people ca n't just cross the border to get a gun . 
  the list of differences between swiss and u.s. gun control is quite long . 
  he spends all day misrepresenting this trying to make the claim that gun culture is simply better than the u.s. so relaxing the current swiss laws wo n't result in more gun crime . 
  the fact is its considerably harder for criminals to get guns there than the u.s. none of this touches the suicide problem they have compared to thier immediate neighbors . 
  in the u.s. , the link between suicide and gun ownership rates between the states is well documented . 
  edit : now who 's down voting facts they do n't like ? 
  typical . 
   it 's always annoying when people think we have guns everywhere . 
  op often claims you do have guns everywhere . 
  he 's also omitting that things do vary by canton , and he 's using the easiest canton as his example . 
   no one here carries guns in public , and hardly even in private . 
  op routinely advocates for for carrying of firearms in switzerland . 
  he thinks it should be easier and wants to fully import the us gun culture into switzerland . 
  you ca n't trust what he says , as [ he 's more than willing to deceive when advocating his positions ] ( https://archive.is/hxmf4 ) . 
  no it 's not , because this is already way above and beyond gun laws here in the us . 
  in most states you do n't need even a background check or a permit to buy a gun . 
  there 's no registration , no licenses , nothing . 
  we have 300,000,000 guns in circulation and no clue exactly where most of them are or who owns what . 
  it 's ridiculously easy for the black market to function here or people with criminal records to get firearms via social networks . 
  and we do n't have mandatory military service of any kind .
