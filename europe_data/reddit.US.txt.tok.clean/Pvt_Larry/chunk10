  yep , damned chechens . 
  if you believe anyone other than the russian government killed that man then you 're deluding yourself . 
  that is so cool !, 
  not all liberal politicians are so light on follow-through . 
  a similar ideological leaning is not a predictor of similar performance in office . 
  compare europe 's different liberal , conservative , and social-democratic parties ; there 's plenty of distinction there . 
  obviously a french voter would be more knowledgeable , but from my reading in the papers over here it sounds like he wants to make some cuts to unemployment benefits but also wants a 50 billion euro public investment program to stimulate the economy . 
  he 's progressive on social issues . 
  very much a centrist , or maybe center-left depending on your viewpoint . 
  he 's pretty centrist , lots of talk about bridging partisan divides and all that ; depending on who you ask he 's described as being center-left or center-right . 
  in essence he wants to make some cuts to welfare but promote more state investment , and is socially progressive . 
  if there is n't any then the russians will invent some . 
  is he bragging ? 
  it seems to be endemic - it happens everywhere , every time . 
  macron is very much the candidate of the center . 
  the fact of the matter is that the left is mired in endless in-fighting and so he 's the most progressive candidate with a realistic chance of winning at this point . 
  indeed , the schulz - merkel matchup is enough to make me terribly envious of german voters . 
  there 's no macron or schulz supporter who thinks that way . 
  the left is far too busy squabbling amongst themselves as usual anyway . 
  that 's precisely why the french election is a competition between macron and fillon . 
  nothing 's worse for populists than being forced to actually govern , it discredits them completely . 
  unfortunately it does little to prevent short-term damage . 
  well , depending on what state you 're standing in . 
   the eu has shown it is n't capable yet of tackling large issues but is n't that ultimately because of the unwillingness of nation-states to cooperate and put the collective good ahead of their perceived self-interest ? 
  it seems to me that european problems require european solutions , but that the only way to work on that magnitude is through greater centralization . 
  because everywhere except the uk ( since corbyn is woefully inept ) they 've only succeeded in pushing mainstream voters further left ; in austria a former green party leader with an extremely pro-eu platform was elected . 
  macron and shulz , pro-european social democrats , looks set to defeat not only the far-right but also the center right in france and germany . 
  the reaction to these extremist movements is more powerful than the far-right itself !, 
  honestly looking at the current upcoming elections in europe it seems increasingly that with most of the far-right parties it 's a lot of noise that does n't really come out to much electorally . 
  i suppose we 'll see if that holds however . 
  is that really true ? 
  ethiopia for instance is doing much better than , say , the congo , uganda , and other former colonies in the neighborhood . 
  in the same sense thailand is better off than myanmar , cambodia , and the other former southeast asian colonies . 
  and how many other countries were never colonized ? 
  they 're really then only two i can think of . 
  west africa as a region is also at the forefront of development . 
  i do n't really see why she 's doing it ( i honestly do n't think this is a tactical move , it 's just the fn 's true nature showing ) but if what you 're describing does occur then that 's pretty much the best possible outcome in my book . 
  more like the `` pro-russian propagandist resorting to whataboutism to distract from the crimes of his nation '' response , and it 's valid as always . 
  have you never been on reddit before ? 
  i 'm not even german but i 've seen / r/the _ schulz in / r/rising all the time . 
  i used to downvote because i assumed it was another fascist / r/the _ donald spinoff but then i learned who schulz was . 
  probably intended for domestic consumption more than anything , but the bizarre anti-gay propaganda that comes out of russia really is something to behold . 
  well that was nice . 
  yeah i was a little taken aback but i should n't be described . 
  tabloids really are disgusting . 
  that 's an optimistic headline to be sure but i like it !, 
  can my french friends tell me if there 's a sense of momentum for macron ? 
  it looks like he 's been doing pretty well for himself in the polls that i see , and it certainly looks like things are getting worse by the day for fillon . 
  still good , but a lost opportunity for sure . 
  that was much more emotional than i anticipated . 
  the format may be silly but the enthusiasm is honest . 
  it 's no joke . 
  you too can soon have the most * tremendous * healthcare in the world . 
  just a fascist , do n't worry about him too much . 
   trump 's policies are complete opposite to putin 's i 'm far from convinced about that , a nationalist , authoritarian kleptocracy where media criticism is silenced , gays get assaulted by angry mobs , and all the government cronies get oil money passed around sounds exactly like what trump and pence would like . 
  and then watching them all lose their collective minds and drop the veil after he lost , ranting angrily in english . 
  absolutely hilarious . 
  there is / r/the _ macron, 
  it could be beautiful . 
  my opinion , personally , is that without intervention libya would look a lot more like syria . 
  that 's not to say that libya is in an enviable position , but syria is quite clearly worse off . 
  i think things should have been handled differently , but i think the outcome that we have is far preferable to what we would 've been left with if there was no intervention . 
  from the ashes of 2016 a phoenix rises !, 
  yeah i consider myself to be pretty progressive but corbyn is absolutely botching the job from my point of view at least . 
  he 's far too concerned with the ideological purity of labor than he is with actually winning elections . 
  i mean the conservatives should be at their very weakest in the lingering fallout from brexit but labor has totally failed to take advantage , there 's no effective opposition . 
   both fillon and le pen are against sanctions . 
  everyday i see more reasons to support macron . 
  looks like we may well see macron displace fillon in second place if the trend holds . 
  just a reminder that / u/danimir also [ thinks osama bin laden was innocent .

  make germany the ddr again more like . 
  well may just took that off the table so that 's on them . 
   or will her popularity surge no matter what [ pssh , ca n't stop macron !,

  are you kidding ? 
  the far right daydreams about putin 's russia . 
  yeah , you 'd think people would start to wonder why we 're the only western country with a system literally designed to circumvent the people 's vote but you know whatever .

  a few more centuries and it will seem like a silly concept to most people . 
  well yes , but that does n't benefit lieberman politically . 
  a lot of that has to do with environment . 
  while there are more white than black people living below the poverty line in the us , most live in rural areas . 
  crime is by definition lower . 
  similarly there are many hispanics ( settled + recent immigrants ) who live outside of significant urban centers , especially in the southwest . 
  in contrast poor blacks are more likely to live in [ high concentration poverty areas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concentrated_poverty ) in cities , which will by their nature have higher incidence of crime . 
  basically population density is the reason for the higher homicide rates . 
  there are entire counties without a doctor there . 
  complete lack of public services whatsoever , it 's borderline third-world in the hinterlands of some of these states . 
  in many cases it may be simply impossible to move . 
  well that would be counterproductive , since security and economic issues create migrants anyway . 
  all of those have editorial independence though ; something that the kremlin-owned outlets lack . 
  well it 's not exactly free , it 's costing putin by the hour . 
  yesterday one of putin 's duma buddies said that `` nato secret service '' was behind it . 
  maybe they also assumed that the dude had been caught - would 've been pretty embarrassing if it turned out he was working for aqap or somebody else after they took responsibility . 
  literally bin laden 's ghost . 
   look at what they 're doing to the ia in mosul .
