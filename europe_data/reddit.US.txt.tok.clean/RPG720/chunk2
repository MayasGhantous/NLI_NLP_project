  you do if the `` purpose designed plane '' would get shot down in any modern conflict . 
  if by effective you mean responsible for a massive number of friendly fire and civilian casualties in proportion to the number of a-10s fielded , i guess they would be . 
  wtf, 
  yes , with maverick missiles . 
  please do n't call them tankbusters . . they 'd be no better at busting tanks than an f-16 . 
  insults are illegal ? 
  they also do n't need healthcare . 
   and the us is dealing with its own immigration problems so they might make some noise but there wo n't be any consequences . 
  if anything , right wing parties would praise whatever action would be taken . 
  i began to suspect that after i wrote my comment . 
  thanks for the confirmation  . 
  are n't almost all of those russian made ? 
   it is obvious that she wasnt killed in a fight . 
  what are you basing that off of ? 
  the takeaway is that the turkish police forces , not the turkish military killed her and then did this . 
  i feel like everyone is misunderstanding what i said . 
  i agree with you ? 
  intervention meaning what , exactly ? 
  no , dumbass , he was saying that you believed that islam does not have a place in western society and that discrimination does . 
  you then reply stating that if discrimination is justified , it has no place in western society . 
  why do n't you learn english instead of making yourself look like a complete ass ? 
  those things are very important as well . 
  i do n't think anyone here is denying their importance . 
  if there was a major correlation between what someone had for breakfast and their statistical chance to commit a crime , absolutely . 
  yeah , totally because of the cannabis page . 
  ~ ~ you may want to re-read what you wrote , lol . ~ ~ edit : you all suck at english . 
  but m8 ... 
  we obviously ca n't trust the people . 
  we ca n't give them the truth . 
  yes they do , and they fight quite hard to preserve the language , actually . 
  whaaaat the fuuuuck ... 
  catalan . 
   nuclear war my suspicion is confirmed . 
   and it probably would take something more than invading little estonia for a militarised reaction by nato it 's obvious that you know fuck all about nato , then . 
   i now im right in this question . 
  i have morals that you people don \u00b4 t have . 
  gr8 b8 m8, 
  we should all try to do what you described . 
  i was on irc , and asked if dual nationality flairs were a thing . 
  this sounds like much the same thing , so i 'd love it if this were implemented !, 
  too late , lol . 
  how the fuck did this town survive soviet rule ... edit : i am an ignorant american . 
  how , exactly ? 
   dcs brother !, 
  have you read fucking anything about isis in egypt ? 
  that is an excuse not to try . 
  you better believe if a conflict arose , we would be there . 
  oh yeah , mhm , totally us . 
   besides that , the system in question would n't need to work against it-experts , but should only make access ( without proper id ) hard enough to work against kids . 
  hahaha . 
  hahahahaha . 
  hahahahahahaha, 
  they should be allowed to continue their operations imo, 
  he should fucking kill himself . 
   i 'm pretty sure denmark could muster enough battle hardned veterans to invade and kick the shit out of pretty much all neighbors , including german . 
  i very much doubt there would be a war between two nato countries ending in anything but one or both of those countries being kicked out of nato . 
  rip detroit, 
  great comment . 
  edit : the comment i replied to said something along the lines of `` i want to say something racist , but i wo n't . '', 
  that has been pixelated into the early 80s . 
  no fucking way ... 
  that 's the problem . 
  wtf are you on about . 
  now now , let 's not join the shit throwing festival . 
  yeah , could you fuck off with that please ? 
  nuclear war will not happen with russia no matter what we do in ukraine . 
  it would take an action against russia or the united states or other nato member to cause anything near that . 
  quit fear mongering and grow a fucking spine . 
  marines ? 
  that 's a change . . 
  * grabs popcorn *, 
  kindly standby until i get home and have access to a computer , so i can show you . 
   unilateral declarations onf independence do n't succeeded ** unless there is a long history of violence and oppression ** you could use a history lesson my friend . 
  i 've been waiting far to long for someone to say everything you just have . 
   they refused europeaness and britishness ** when they decided to not only remain muslim ** * grabs popcorn *, 
  is that what he meant ? 
  that was not my understanding of his comment at all . 
  if he was in fact referring to the fact that they looked arab then i agree with you 100 % . 
  i thought he was in a way disowning them as brittons because they joined isis , not because they look arab . 
  i think we can both agree that that was n't op 's intention . 
  i 'm fairly certain that those who would join isis do n't frequent / r/europe , and if any of them do , fuck them . 
  flair checks out, 
  shots fired, 
  i can guess your flair . 
  i really hope i 'm wrong . 
  i would very much like to see a source for this as well . 
  sounds like the right engine ate a bird . 
   centuries a bit more than that , actually . 
  i 'm quite near there as well , actually . 
  perhaps i was in a more boring area , haha . 
  i do !, 
  lovely people  . 
  i think it 's surreal because , at least to me , it seems as though time was slowing down as people waited for the results . 
  i 'm in spain at the moment , and everyone is watching the news like its a football match . 
  kind of surreal , actually . . 
  in the context of the article , kinda yeah . 
  you 're not wrong , you 're just an asshole . 
  more like do n't cooperate and we wo n't help you . 
  flew from dallas to barcelona . 
  expected cool air .
