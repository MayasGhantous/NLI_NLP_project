  there 's little actual * need * for him to `` go for kazakhstan '' . 
   german cars are very reliable . 
  german cars ? 
  are we talking about the same germany that has daimler-benz and volkswagen ? 
  maybe compared to * french * cars ... 
  i thought that was germany ? 
  kidding !, 
  germany has the worst . 
  i 've tasted virginian wines that are better . 
   those missiles would n't stop russia with thousands of nukes . 
  bring able to stop , say , 12 nuclear missiles greatly reduces the odds of a accidental nuclear exchange . 
  one of the reasons why ltc stanislav petrov did n't kick off ww3 was because he knew that if it * was n't * a false alarm the moscow abm system ( which covers much of european russia ) could deal with it . 
  a accidental nuclear launch suddenly goes from being a catastrophe that may or may not lead to nuclear war to something that can be dealt with with no bloodshed/escalation . 
  [ real pain does n't describe it ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/britains-trident-nuclear-program-at-stake-in-scottish-independence-vote/2014/08/24/7a987b40-b41b-4edb-9ae8-064533b143b0_story.html ) . 
  the treasury is already saying that it should n't have to pay for the replacement ( in the past , nuclear weapons delivery systems was paid for independent of rn and raf procurement funds so as to not cut into conventional forces ) , and the costs involved in building new facilities in england may be prohibitive . 
   latino immigrants to america are much more willing to adapt to american customs than the muslim immigrants that are coming into europe . 
  i 'll add that a good chunk of the country has always had heavy hispanic influence , hence if they move into the southwest the `` integration '' is much easier than , say , north dakota . 
  a good third of the lower 48 has * always * had a latin flavor . 
   we would also need to find a way to circumvent mad , because as long as it 's in place , there 's limited utility to having more power than the minimum you need to defend yourself . 
  considering that the uk is seriously considering ditching the deterrence if scotland goes it 's own way , a few hundred warheads under exclusive control of france does n't sound like much of a umbrella for europe at large . 
  and it 's always better to have different options between `` do nothing '' and `` nuclear war '' . 
   because germany thought it was a bad idea . 
  which made them a minority . 
  point is that the eu ca n't get a unified foreign policy figured out even when a crazy guy is publicly saying he 's going to wipe out half a million people once the city falls . 
  `` unified defense and foreign policy '' is impossible with the current iteration of the eu . 
  everyone thought it was a bad a idea , right up until gaddafi said he was going to kill everyone in benghazi and folks decided it could n't be ignored if he was explicitly saying he was going to kill half a million people beforehand . 
  the asad regime in syria , by contrast , has been very careful to * not * say `` we 're going to kill as many people as possible '' . 
  if a government provides a out for the international community , we tend to take it . 
  going completely off the rails tends to elicit reactions other than `` ignore/shrug '' . 
   an unified defense and foreign policy , in my opinion , is key to show that russia ca n't just fuck around with europe and get away with it . 
  good luck with that . 
  germany ca n't even bring itself to actively participate in something like the 2011 intervention in libya , which otherwise had widespread support from international organizations . 
  germany is n't the only one that has this problem , but barring a truly `` united states of europe '' , you 're always going to have member nations of the eu who have greatly divergent defense and foreign policies . 
  the rest of your post is workable , but trying to manage a unified eu foreign and defense policy is like herding cats . 
   i was referring the fact that extracting citizens is a process that almost never happens in egypt . 
  that does n't mean they wo n't do it . 
  it does n't happen with a lot of countries , because frankly most of them ca n't do much about it other than charter airplanes and often times wealthier countries/big business will price out the foreign ministry of some crappy country in the rush to get people out . 
   egyptian nationals trapped in yemen when the saudis attacked were picked up and saved by the indian army . 
  okay ? 
  so what ? 
  you do realize that that only means that egypt was n't able to perform the evacuation , right ? 
  even if the egyptian government did n't care about the citizenry , they would still care about embassy personnel , for instance . 
   britain did n't run out of bombs during the libyan conflict . 
  it came close enough that the us ended up selling some from our own warstocks . 
  that is not indicative of a healthy supply of war material against anyone who could remotely be considered a near-peer . 
  you 'll further note that the us provided nearly all of the refueling , jamming , and isr over libya . 
  hell , france needed to rely on usaf lift to help move stuff when they intervened in mali . 
  the uk and france can handle someone about as organized as sierra leone by themselves , that 's it . 
  they certainly ca n't , to quote / u/rafxgsy `` easily match anyone except the us and china '' . 
   britain and france could easily match anyone except the us and china the same britain that [ started to run out pgms a month into bombing libya ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/af3o7eld_story.html ) even * after * the us did all the hard work of destroying the air defense network ? 
  that britain ? 
  iran is n't arabic to start with . 
  it 's purely a prestige buy . 
  yes , once in a blue moon they might be used for humanitrian purposes or evacuating egyptian nationals somewhere , but egypt will never sail this things very far from home so they are n't gon na be used for that . 
  maybe they 'll be used to help with the intervention in yemen ? 
  would n't be the first time egypt has intervened in yemen . 
  the fsa is not isis , dingus . 
  just downvoting away , huh ? 
  i can dig it . 
   the nsa is worse , because they have global reach and they steal tech and economic secrets as well . 
  yeah , you 're pretty privileged . 
  you literally think that some vague nsa snooping is worse than someone reporting you to the morality police and then * really will * come by and set you on fire , or throw you from a building for being gay . 
  i mean , stealing technical secrets or economic information that 's waaaaaay worse for you than getting stoned to death or beheaded in a soccer stadium or sold into sexual slavery , right ? 
   the us government is the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism . 
  [ citation needed ], 
   you armed the islamists in libya who then moved to syria to fight assad really , * we * did huh ? 
  someone is forgetting that the libyan intervention was a mostly european intervention . 
  and most of the people in libya did n't pack up and go to syria because , frankly , the civil war in libya is on going . 
  no reason to leave for another war when the current one has n't ended . 
   the ambassador killed in bengazi had direct links to terrorists who became isis , he used them against gaddafi . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  oh yeah , i live in terror that the us government is gon na come knocking at my door for what i say on the internet . 
  yes , nsa snooping is completely analogous to being ratted out to the morality police in isis controlled areas . 
  how privileged are you that you think the situation is at all equitable ? 
  they have a little noam chompsy magic 8-ball . 
  `` what is your opinion of [ foreign crisis ] ? '', 
  only answering `` america did it . '', 
   the americans have been arming isis for years . 
  no we have n't . 
  we 've armed and trained members of the fsa , [ with pretty shitty results ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/the-pentagons-syria-debacle-isil-assad-us-military-defense-soldiers/ ) but not isis ( unless you count battlefield pickups from equipment we gave the iraqi army ) . 
  hell , most of the fighting in syria is in the western , urban areas , between the fsa and similar groups and the asad regime . 
  isis controls the mostly rural eastern part of the country . 
  * even if it were true * that the us has been `` arming isis for years '' , it is n't relevant to prolonging the syrian civil war . 
  because most of the fighting is going on in the western part of the country , while isis ca n't materially affect the outcome of the war . 
  yeah , all they have to worry about is the relatives/friends/neighbors reporting to the morality police . 
  no thanks . 
  this is small change compared to what will happen once climate change well and truly sets in . 
  there is an international beer conference and afterwards the ceos of budweiser , coors , and guiness meet up for beers . 
  the ceo of budweiser says `` give me the king of beers . 
  give me a budweiser . '', 
  the ceo of coors says `` give me the only beer made from colorado rockies mountain waters . 
  give me a coors . '', 
  the ceo of guiness says `` i 'll take a water . '', 
  flabbergasted , the other two ask why he 's getting a water . 
  `` well if you two are n't ordering beers i 'm not going to either ... '', 
  yeah , i know ( i am a repository of useless information ) . 
  the gf did n't know that until she lived there though . 
  girlfriend spent a year in greenland , and the locals would ask her `` so ... why are n't you americans buying us ? '' . 
  ( apparently the inuit really dislike the danes ) somehow , i suspect that that movement would gain a lot of legs if something like `` rent space in greenland to dump refugees '' gained traction . 
  could n't even think it through even a little bit , huh ?
