  i think he might have stolen that from an early 90s tom clancy novel . 
  western sanctions created in reaction to the russian governments actions , which the russian people seem to largely support . 
  instead of blaming the person who got them there ( putin ) russians are blaming the big bad west . 
   nuclear powers do n't piss about with each other . 
  specifically because of the danger of nuclear war . 
  i guess the kargil war never happened . 
  this is really shitty cost benefit analysis you 're making . 
  `` nuclear powers wo n't screw with each other , of course , if they do go to war it 'll be the most catastrophic even in written human history . 
  we should give more people nukes . '', 
  all it takes is one fuck up for the whole thing to come tumbling down . 
  the intervention ( `` invasion '' has connotations of large numbers of boots on the ground ) was neither us led or occurred after the russians began their adventure in ukraine . 
  additionally , libya was never in possession of actual devices . 
  most former soviet states gave up their nukes because the global community pinky-promised that they would n't get fucked over . 
  that has n't worked out too well . 
  the only country outside of the former ussr that had nukes and gave them up was south africa . 
   crime statistics are thus only of limited use and not to be taken as absolute facts . 
  pretty much . 
  the uk is often talked up as being more violent-crime ridden than the us thanks to the way the uk reports statistics ( and anecdotally , there ** may ** be a kernel of truth to it ) , but us violent crime is more likely to end with someone dead . 
  as an example as to how borked crime statistics are from country to country . 
  ... like they already have in cyprus and syria ? 
  the new bases would n't even be in parts of the mediterranean where they do n't have bases anyway . 
  tank their economy through economic warfare . 
  seriously , all it took was secretary kerry to ask the saudis to increase oil production to tank the russian economy , and russia at least produces * stuff * ( even if it 's what you buy if you ca n't buy american or european equipment ) . 
  greece is in it 's current state because it does n't produce anything , or have any hope of making debt payments on a timely manner . 
  edit : for those rocket scientists downvoting me , my point was there are a whole slew of coercive/punitive tools before you get to the `` invade ? '', 
  point . 
   it gives them bases and ** easier access to the mediterranean ** , thus significantly boosting their power projection . 
  i really do not see how greece gives russia anymore `` access to the mediterranean '' then it has now . 
  if turkey changed camps , it would be a different matter . 
  yeah , that is n't a very good response . 
  you made the claim that the us continuously bombs other countries ( `` all the time '' ) . 
  even if this were true , and it is n't , it does n't magically mean most were unjustified or that the us is particularly unique in that regard compared to some of the major european countries like the uk and france . 
   perhaps if you did n't do that ** all the time ** , it would n't ? 
  [ citation needed ], 
  but what about the negroes being lynched in the us ? 
  retorted khrushchev when asked about the gulags . 
   as long as it 's not the wrong part of the world , eh ? 
  depends on it . 
  i spend several weeks while in the usn doing humanitarian work in the biggest muslim country on the planet ( by population ) in dec 04-spring 05 thanks to the indian ocean tsunami . 
  i saw many australian ships ( and planes ) . 
  i saw many american ships ( and planes ) . 
  i saw singaporean ships and planes . 
  other than one french ship and it 's personnel ( the * jeanne d'arc * ) i did not see any european military personnel . 
  wikipedia helpfully informs me that monetary aid packages were established , but that did n't do a lot to help with the immediate crisis . 
  certainly i did n't see any european naval vessels running hoses ashore and pumping freshwater to the refugee camps . 
  it 's easy to take a crap on the us in `` other places '' , but ultimately it 's because our military is solely viewed by other countries through a `` blow shit up '' lens . 
   by the way even if you managed to change the law guns would still be illegal to own . 
  guns are completely legal to own in france . 
  [ you can own guns in france that would be illegal in some us states ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/2ook40/frenchies_have_guns_too/ ) . 
  then you should have said that instead of `` violent crimes '' .

   satellites in orbit do n't move at mach 20 + heh . 
  satellites * absolutely do * move that fast . 
  and for the record , icbms do n't move that fast except on terminal , which coincidentally , is why most abm systems do n't target at terminal . 
   while taking evasive actions . 
  satellites travel in predictable orbits . 
  this is wonderful . 
  ballistic missile trajectories are largely scripted by gravity . 
  they do not take `` evasive actions '' any more than those satellites you are knocking do . 
  if you can find an example of icbms taking `` evasive actions '' i 'd love to see it . 
  perhaps you are thinking of cruise missiles , which are a substantially different beasts . 
   they are pitched as anti irbms because that 's what they are . 
  they 're pitched as such for political purposes . 
  they are perfectly usable as anti-icbms in the boost phase , and are somewhat more limited in the terminal phase . 
  they ca n't really do mid-course intercept for icbms , but that 's why you have icbm-class missiles in alaska and california . 
   the old argument us has powerful weapons but they are classified so nobody knows about them . 
  did n't say that . 
  i said they made a classified number of skin-to-skin kills . 
  which they did . 
  folks like stuart slade and others in the industry are well aware of this . 
   gmd as of june 2014 had 53 % effectiveness ... are you not aware that you are repeating back to me something i already said ? 
  the whole assumption is `` look-shoot-shoot-look '' , iow , it was never pitched as one-hit one-kill . 
  if you do n't know what i 'm referring to when i say `` look-shoot-shoot-look '' then this calls into question your knowledge of bmd systems even more . 
   eventually gmd will probably be operational but it would be a lot easier if they used nuclear tipped interceptors and not kinetic kill vehicles . 
  but even then there is a price problem , because if the enemy icbm carries 10 warheads you need 10 interceptors for 1 icbm , and as you said they cost the same . 
  no you do n't , and this shows how little you understand bmd that you 're making this comment . 
  [ the warheads do n't de-buss until the icbm has tipped over and gone into terminal . 
  ] ( http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/images/icbm_traj.gif ) more specifically , they do n't separate from the payload section until they 've reached the top of the parabolic curve . 
  [ the gmd is designed to intercept it mid course ] ( http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/img/special/koreatoday/090326_p13_will_650.jpg ) ( in other words , before that happens ) . 
  if you can find a abm system , anywhere , that is designed to intercept warheads instead of missiles or payload shrouds i 'll love to see it . 
  this is a conversation that comes up fairly frequently in / r/credibledefense and the `` lol mirvs bmd a shit '' has been beaten to death . 
   tels have existed since first topols probably even earlier they 're nothing new . 
  no shit , look up the midgetman . 
  and it 's still a warmed over topol-m that is only more dangerous in that they are more survivable to first strikes than silo-based icbms and possibly even ssbns . 
   i 'm surprised it 's not more considering how much land they have . 
  the canadians punch way above their weight class , i was never not impressed with their navy when we exercised with them . 
  ca n't say the same for the german navy . 
  canada has a whole lot of nothing , and as a result , fundamentally the best way the can contribute to nato is manning early warning stations and offering the space for other nato members to have field exercises . 
  you can only squeeze so much maple syrup from a population smaller than california , especially if you want to pay their personnel wages that attract high quality people . 
  `` being invaded and occupied , and eventually maybe bleeding them out '' is a pretty shitty defense strategy . 
   problem is sm-3 missiles do fuck all against icbms they they can take out satellites in orbit , they can take out icbms . 
  they are pitched as `` only for irbms/srbms '' because hurr iran and totally not russia is the stated reason for the european deployment . 
  whenever north korea tests long range missiles japan and the us station sm-3 missiles off the coast to swat them down in boost phase , if need be . 
   only systems so far that had any effectiveness against icbms are nike zeus and a-135 . 
  both used/use nuclear warheads on their interceptors and even then they would do squat against a modern icbm like rs-24 . 
  we had a classified number of skin to skin kills with the nike zeus in the 60s and 70s . 
  the gmd system in alaska has had a similar success level ( in other words , 2 or three missiles to take out one icbm ) . 
  people knock this because you need icbm-sized missiles ( and so icbm-cost missiles ) in order to take out icbms at the distances we 're talking , but the gmd has always been pitched as `` at least two interceptor missiles per icbm '' ( look-shoot-shoot-look ) . 
  the warmed-over topol-m that is the rs-24 is not particularly more dangerous than other icbms of the past . 
  the main benefit to them is they are easier to hide rather than putting them in silos , or even submarines , making them more survivable to first strikes .
