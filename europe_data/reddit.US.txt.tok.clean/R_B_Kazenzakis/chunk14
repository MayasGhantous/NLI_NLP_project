  man , not even that . 
  there are fairly large swaths of nature readily accessible in the eastern states as well . 
  new york state has ** one park ** bigger than macedonia for instance . 
  also , if you 're ever in virginia/the dc area hit me up and i 'll take you shooting . 
  if you 're ever anywhere in the us , visit / r/guns and mention it and someone will almost certainly volunteer to take you shooting . 
  why not ? 
  there 's a ground zero liquor store and ground zero `` adult toys '' store . 
  north atlantic council . 
  why change too much from nato ? 
  honestly , i 'm not too sure that for a swat-type unit that matters for intimidation . 
  as it is , north texas is fairly arid and if for some reason they have to be outside it 's a appropriate camo pattern . 
  for example [ this is what the texas rangers wear in the field nowadays ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/washingtonpost/2011/10/10/foreign/images/ap110608041916.jpg?uuid=rkjtuvoueecslyczcra_bq ) . 
  bummer you 're getting downvoted . 
  what finally prodded the eu and us into action was gaddafi saying he was going to kill everyone in benghazi when he took the city ( actually it was something like `` everyone in the city are vermin , and we know how to treat vermin '' ) . 
  no one wanted to deal with half a million dead right across from europe if he carried out his threat , especially since he was saying so beforehand . 
  meanwhile , the asad regime in syria has been * careful as fuck * to make statements either blaming civilian casualties on rebels , civilian casualties are really combatants , or saying `` oops '' . 
  surprise surprise , no one has been willing to stick their hands in that hornets nest ( until it looked like baghdad was going to fall to isis ) . 
  lesson learned : do n't public ally say you 're gon na kill a shitload of people . 
  france has never been happy . 
  i do , but unfortunately it would be a pretty mixed squad . 
  ak here , ar here , mini-14 here , garand there ... 
   also it 's very sensible that we bought french helicopters over american ones , since the latter are small and we have a decent number of that kind ( sok\u00f3\u0142 ) ** while needing the large ones . 
  ** so buy some ~ ~ shithooks ~ ~ chinooks :p, 
  iron dome has proven very effective against home made , shortange rockets , similar to the american c-ram used in bases in afghanistan and iraq . 
  it is n't something you 'd want to use against something more sophisticated ( scuds or iskander missiles ) . 
  israel has a different system for that called arrow . 
   aegis/standard 's all-purpose `` fuck everything not touching the ground and also ships because we can use these as anti-ship missiles too '' it 's worth noting that aegis ashore is exclusively bmd , not multiuse . 
  it is n't exactly chopping off the top of the superstructure of a aegis destroyer and putting it on the ground , although it has been marketed as such . 
  unless there 's a thread on roma , or asylum seekers . 
   next time you might want to read the full sentence , nazi germany is clearly mentioned as one of key countries in the development of spaceflight . 
  ... i was specifically referring to nazi germany . 
  what do you think `` operation paperclip '' referenced ? 
  for the rest of it , i feel as if we 're arguing in circles . 
  or we are agreeing in different ways . 
   if there 's no war it is n't a `` if it 's not being used to actually bomb stuff , it 's a waste of money '' situation . 
  * for good or ill * having the means to inflict damage on other people helps guide other countries into acting in the interest of the us ( or france , or britain , or china , or russia ) . 
  and even if the us bought 180 f-22s that were never used in wartime , it would still be a smart move from a national security standpoint . 
  it maintains the industrial base in what is a fairly narrow economic area . 
  when the uk took a ten year `` building holiday '' for nuclear submarines after the cold war ended , they faced significant problems with manufacturing the * astute * class subs , to the point that they had to import workers from electric boat in the us and from french shipyards to retrain people . 
  yeah , but they get a wad of cash from the dod for hypersonic vehicle research and such . 
   research is very often profit motivated for private industry , sure . 
  good luck telling private investors you want to research how electromagnetic waves interact with certain material and you * might * be able to get something tangible to market in 15 years . 
  or not . 
   why spend it on military instead of on better highways the american interstate system was actually built to meet a military need to easily move stuff around the country . 
  in fact , in the western part of the us there are stretches of interstate that are intended to be dispersal airfields in case of war time . 
  of course , it had a subsidiary effect of improving civilian commerce . 
   the space program required 3 different countries ** required ** is a big word . 
  it certainly made things easier , but it is n't as if a icbm/space program would be doa without operation paperclip ( and the soviet version of it ) . 
   spending enormous amounts of money on something useless for civilians . 
  comms , mapping , weather , navigation ... oh yea , all of those are useless . 
   how many airline companies would use them if they had to pay subscription , regular people certainly could n't pay for them . 
  i did n't know that europe had libertarians in it . 
  sometimes you need government funding to drastically improve the economy and quality of life . 
  there 's nothing inherently wrong with that . 
   military spending is a terribly inefficient way to invest into technology innovation . 
  eh , modern electronics are basically a byproduct of military requirements to miniaturize them . 
  it was n't until the mid 70s or so that electronics marketed to private industry became to bypass military/government program requirements . 
   those planes will never be used against russia or china no , they 'll be used against countries that are flying late model su30-mkis , as well as pak fas or j-20s . 
  edit : i guess / u/canal _ volphied would rather just downvote everyone who disagrees with him than try to think his answers through . 
   you realize that f-35 was created to replace f-22 no it was n't . 
  in the usaf it 's supposed to replace the f-16 , in the usn the f/a -18 , and in the usmc ( and rn as well as likely other navies with ski-jump carriers ) the harrier . 
   which were in turn created to replace f-117 . 
  no it was n't . 
  it was originally intended to replace the f-15 , which is why the original buy was going to be 800 of the damn things . 
  the f-117 currently has no * declassified * replacement , which is a big deal because nothing really fills that niche ( stealth attack craft with laser pgms ) . 
  it 's * likely * that either the f-117 has a classified replacement or that the f-117 has been upgraded surreptitiously . 
  either way , it 's still flying in places like tonopah and the ranch despite being decommissioned . 
   just read about this horrible mess . 
  not really , it 's about the same as other projects . 
  truly awful programs in recent history would be the [ fcs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_combat_systems ) which was anticipated to be more expensive than the f-35 program at the time of it 's cancellation . 
  people just assume that the f-35 is particularly bad thanks to the internet and everyone is a defense industry analyst as a result . 
  folks who do n't understand that the dod has made a conscious decision to front-load all the requirements at the start rather than hustle out a bare bones model ( which is what we did with the f-16 and f/a -18 ) that falls out of the sky for reasons we do n't understand ( which is what happened with the harrier and f-104 ) and add crazy shit like radar to it later . 
  but , keep on repeating stuff that you read on `` war is boring '' . 
   there 's no innovation coming from it . 
  stealthy , best ew/ecm suite on the planet only stovl aircraft that is supersonic , ultra-secure comms . 
  gon na replace a half a dozen aircraft . 
  it 's reasonably innovative . 
  the thing to remember about ike is that he was , as fdr said , `` the supreme political animal '' . 
  he suddenly started knocking the military-industrial complex during his last week in office , he also acted as if he had had a hand in discussions to use the bomb in japan during ww2 when there is no indication anywhere that he did ( other than his own memoirs . 
  his own letters to other people at the time indicate otherwise ) . 
  that 's how much of a political animal he was . 
  he had no problem with backing the biggest peacetime expenditure of defense * ever * in american history ( 10 % of the gdp ) during his administration , and unlike today where most of the us dod spending goes to personnel costs and training , back then it largely went towards weapons systems procurement . 
  he was only anti-military when he was worried about his legacy . 
  not saying that the us spends too much ( or too little ) on the military , but eisenhower is not a very credible person to be repeating pacifist quotes from . 
  prestige is part of it . 
  but really , the ioc is such a group of pricks [ that no one wants to deal with them ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/10/02/ioc_demands_oslo_drops_bid_after_over_the_top_list_of_requirements.html ) which is how we have a bunch of third world countries that are looking at this as a graft scheme rather than a prestige project . 
   buchanan was gay ? 
  i seriously never knew that yup . 
  i do n't have the book in front of me , but it was one of those open secrets `` confirmed bachelor '' situations , to the point that other people in congress made snide remarks about it . 
  serious american answer : * james buchanan . 
  he was the president during bleeding kansas , did little to stop the fracturing of the country , and after abraham lincoln was elected he did n't do anything to arrest the secession of the southern states . 
  indeed , he instructed us army personnel in texas to turn over stores to the texas militia . 
  but he was the first/only gay president , so there 's that . 
  * second worst/craziest ? 
  probably andrew jackson . 
  allowed the central bank charter to expire , ignored a supreme court ruling prohibiting the removal of indians from their lands in the southeast us and forced-marched them to oklahoma . 
  otoh , he did promise to personally lead a army to `` hang the secesh '' if south carolina went through with it 's threat to secede during his administration . 
  * woodrow wilson . 
  absurdly racist , to the point he * reversed * policy and made federal civil service segregated . 
  invaded mexico twice , as well as several other latin american countries .
