  ran on `` keeping the us out of the war '' while having a committee formed to encourage us involvement on the entente side to the american public . 
  despite this , did not materially prepare the us military for it ( other than the navy , which was lavishly funded anyway ) . 
  when the us got involved he instituted a police state that dubya bush ( or obama ) could n't get away with in his wildest wet dreams , asserting that there could be `` no disruption to our national conscience '' , going so far as to throw religious conscientious objectors like quakers and anabaptists ( including those who said they would work as litter-bearers/ambulance drivers ) into prison across the board . 
  eradicated german as the most common second language in the states . 
  blamed the war on the `` german jew bankers '' . 
  ran the first red scare in the us . 
  all in all , worst president of the 20th century . 
  i 'd say you guys were definitely `` saddled '' with him . 
  especially when the guy * always * builds a hotel on boardwalk . 
   not to mention , the russian abm network has never been tested , it was tested in the 70s , in fact it was specifically exempted from the abm treaty . 
   any of it 's capabilities shown we know that they use nuclear tipped-warheads to get around the skin-kill problem , thanks to the inspection regimes established with the various usa-ussr/russia arms limitations treaties . 
  the us did the same with the nike zeus and nike hercules in the 60s , with a classified number of skin-to-skin kills using 60s and 70s computers . 
   in which case , a 16 missile load with 10 warheads each is quite sufficent mirvs are better suited for environments * without * abms , because frankly it 's far better to have 400 one-warhead missiles to try to get through than 100 four-warhead missiles . 
   not to mention modern missiles come with counters and deception equipment to get past missile shields . 
  they do huh ? 
  so iow , they probably * do n't * have as many warheads per missile as claimed ? 
  while we do n't know for sure what american , french , and russian countermeasures look like , thanks to [ chevaline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chevaline ) being declassified we know that any significant penetration aide for slbms and icbms means loss of # of warheads , and potentially a reduction of range . 
  what 's great is that , thanks to the moscow abm system , the soviets `` virtually attrited '' the size of the uk warhead stockpile by a third without even firing a shot !, 
  even better , no one is too sure how well the decoys and other penaids work , because you ca n't test them without broadcasting to the other nuclear powers what they are . 
  so you 're betting that they are going to sail right through nuclear-typed anti-missile sams with penaids and decoys that have n't been tested outside of laboratory conditions ? 
   i would n't call china 's tiny nuclear stockpile [ probably larger than you 'd think ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/georgetown-students-shed-light-on-chinas-tunnel-system-for-nuclear-weapons/2011/11/16/giqa6amkao_story.html ) . 
  fact is , no one knows exactly how many they have . 
  they seem to be building the infrastructure for many more warheads than the number commonly thrown around though . 
   outdated delivery methods land based icbms , as well as irbms and srbms for theater use . 
  several ssbns ( more than either france or the uk , meaning more can be on patrol ) . 
  longer range strategic bombers in the form of their badger knock-offs . 
  they have a a lot more methods to deliver nuclear bombs than the ( non-american ) nato nuclear powers do , which creates more of a headache for someone planning on attacking/defeating it . 
   the french arsenal probably has a far better chance one ssbn on patrol , and two airfields where less than a hundred air-launched nuclear missiles on fighter-bombers are stored . 
  not very survivable if france is the recipient of a first strike . 
  whichever ssbn is on patrol is what france has to fight a nuclear war , assuming the russkis ca n't tail it and sink it as the war starts . 
  china has a * far * more survivable nuclear delivery apparatus . 
  * mad is n't a policy , it s the end result of policies that have been promulgated since the 50s , which placed great emphasis on the survivability of the various stockpiles against a first strike . 
  * only the us , ussr , and china have survivable nuclear stockpiles . 
  one ssbn on patrol with 16 missiles does not war winner make ( france and the uk ) , especially when the moscow abm network would probably neutralize most of those . 
  * you are assuming that the nato nuclear powers would want to risk a nuclear exchange over , say , poland . 
  * it 's a good idea to have several options besides `` do nothing '' and `` start throwing nuclear bombs '' ... which is the foreign policy you seem to be advocating . 
   you literally linked a us gov ' t produced video about how awesome the ambassador is . 
  the ambassador in question also talked about how awesome denmark is , so ... fwiw , it seemed like the ambassador was just presenting his fb profile to the nation of denmark , which is n't necessarily a bad thing . 
  `` i like kayaking with my partner '' is a bit more entertaining than a mono-toned delivered spiel about faceless bureaucrats . 
  sarcasm generally implies a amount of self-awareness . 
   why would n't it be like iraq ? 
  because : * iraq had the saudis funding the sunni rebels * iranians funding the shitte rebels . 
  * coalition forces had to act with a light hand in policing the area , for moral and pr reasons . 
  * russia wo n't be trying to end a multi-sided ehtnic civil war with a goal of leaving the country . 
  i mean , that 's just off the top of my head . 
  yes , i suppose it 's possible that the eu/nato would provide supplies for belarussian rebels , but any insurgents would likely be woefully under-supplied compared to the various iraqi factions . 
   i 'd present top gear australia as why this is crucial or tg us . 
  it certainly is n't * bad * , but man , they just do not have the same group dynamic clarkson/may/hammond do . 
  as a result it 's substantially weaker as a entertaining show . 
  stuart slade ( who works [ here ] ( http://www.forecastinternational.com/analysts.cfm# ) ) , used to have a pretty good set of essays on the subject floating around the internet . 
  he 's probably the only `` outed '' nuclear targeteer out there , and if you ever get hard copies of the usni annual books , you 'll see some of his stuff in it . 
  he also self-published a bunch of alternate fiction books that suck . 
  he 's batshit insane , but i have reason to believe he is more or less who he claims to be ( having worked on the same networks as he would have published studies in his claimed professional life ) . 
  i 'm just some dude on the internet though , so no hard feelings if you 're skeptical . 
  anyway , some of these ( brief ) essays are floating around on messageboards . 
  [ why acquiring nuclear weapons tend to change how countries act ] ( http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?t=196646 ) , and [ how the weapons would be targeted ] ( http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?s=72c44edea935b173efc26118ac4090dc&amp;t=213176 ) annndd ... his 103 ( immediate postwar environment ) short essay seems to have dropped off the face of the planet . 
  hmm . 
  edit : well here is a brief essay of his discussing [ nuclear winter ] ( http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/central-south-asia/10912-nuclear-winter-stuart-slade.html ) . 
  i 'll add that while nuclear winter * may not * be as viable as people like carl sagan claimed , the environmental damage of a nuclear exchange would nonetheless be catastrophic . 
  most fisheries would be poisoned by fallout ( and whatever industrial waste from the targeted areas flows down river ) , for instance . 
   so it can happen but it will not because of planning . 
  good to know . 
  actually , i said it probably ca n't happen at all . 
  there simply are n't the numbers or bombs with the tonnage to do it . 
  it 's why i said stuff like `` even if the could do it ( and that 's a big if ) '' . 
  i even led with `` it ca n't '' . 
   do n't worry in the event of a conflict all the world can be covered in nukes like 3 times no it ca n't / would n't . 
  i really wish this trope would n't get repeated . 
  during a general nuclear exchange russia ( or china , i guess ) would n't literally nuke the entire us , even if they could ( which is a big if ) . 
  the incredible vast majority would go to our own nuclear strike assets , which are largely far away from urban centers ( sucks for seattle ) , and our command and control facilities . 
  and then they would have to split it against other nato targets . 
  and they would have to hold a rather substantial number back in case some were shot down , failed enroute , did n't do the job , or did n't detonate . 
  not counting they 'd have to hold some back just in case a third party intervened . 
  all of the above greatly reduces the number that would actually be sent down range to the us ( and the rest of nato ) . 
  a rather substantial number would n't make it just from failures in flight ( this is n't unique to russia , a study in the 80s determined that our minuteman missiles had about 60 % reliability . 
  we have n't substantially upgraded those since and russia almost certainly has worse reliability . 
  your guess is as good as mine as to china 's reliability ) . 
  so now a bunch are going to remain on the ground to be hit with return fire . 
  of course , the us has all the same problems as above , except we are n't splitting our assets against targets against multiple countries , our command and control is better and more secure , we 're gon na have allies with their own nukes involved , and our systems are likely more reliable , if for no other reason that maintenance is better funded . 
  but the point is , in order for a general nuclear war to be able to do what you say , where `` all the world can be covered in nukes like 3 times '' it requires all parties to toss 50 years or so of nuclear planning to the wind and just start tossing nukes willy-nilly . 
  a general nuclear exchange would be the worst thing ever to happen to humanity : but it would be a scenario where one side ( the us and nato ) is the winner by a wide margin . 
  it certainly would n't be the end of human civilization . 
  i 'm amazed you got so many upvotes for this . 
  russia does n't have a shipyard on the black sea that can build nuclear submarines , and it is n't exactly like they transit in without being discovered . 
  russia does n't have any ssbns or ssgns in the black sea , the odds of long range nuclear delivery systems on * kilo * class submarines are vanishingly small . 
  it does n't make a whole hell of a lot of sense to use short legged coastal patrol sub [ that needs to be delivered by cargo ship to new duty stations/export customers ] ( http://media.defenceindustrydaily.com/images/ship_ssk_kilo_class_delivery_to_china_lg.jpg ) as a nuclear strike option . 
   we already upvote comments like `` this thread is full of anti-us idiots '' and the general talk has become very hostile and hateful . 
  so pretty much like worldnews , with slightly less circlejerking though . 
  do n't forget the roma threads . 
  holy shit . 
  pretty much a repeat of what otehr people have said , including the top comment : * better than world news * gives me some insight to what some europeans think of news * gives me some insight as to what some europeans think of each other * i want to know what 's going on in europe , so i can at least * spell * `` angela merkel '' * i used to live in sweden when i was a wee lad , so i have interest from that . 
  * i used to travel about once a quarter to europe for work purposes , so i have interest from that . 
  * i enjoy arguing . 
   rather an ecnomy to shitter than suffer the same ** faith ** of belgium . 
  screw the papists, 
  this sounds like the sort of dangerous percentages brandied about in the us about `` gangs sending their members to join the military for combat training '' . 
  iow , if it does happen , it does n't in significant percentages . 
  [ we 're talking about james buchanan , `` confirmed bachelor '' , right ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_buchanan ), 
  during ww1 germany cut through belgium in order to bypase the french border forts .
