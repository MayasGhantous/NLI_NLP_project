  there 's maintenance , training , deployment certifications , and simple costs that limit the number available . 
   there is literally no scenario were russia could attack europe and not lose even if you take the usa out of the pictures . 
  why not ? 
  because you said so ? 
  franch and the uk started running out of bombs over libya less than a month into it . 
  that does n't bode well when the most warmongering countries of the eu do n't have the war stocks to fight even a 4th rate power ( which had it 's air defenses flattened by the us ) like libya . 
   a ) the usa banned germany of having nuclear weapon * everyone did , in the 50s . 
  not just the usa . 
  * there literally is n't much stopping germany from developing nuclear weapons now if they want to , it just means theoretical `` nuclear engineering aid '' wo n't arrive from the us . 
  india had nukes for less than ten years before the us gave up on abiding by that rule . 
  * you and i both know that germany * will never * develop nuclear weapons on their on , not because of outside pressure , but because even civilian nuclear energy is an anathema in germany anyway . 
  so try not to blame the us for no nuclear weapons in ** 2015 ** . 
   europe has its own nuclear weapons ? 
  * neither france nor the uk has guaranteed use of nuclear weapons to defend germany . 
  do n't believe me ? 
  look it up . 
  * the uk nuclear arsenal is a joke , and the french is only modestly less so . 
  they each only have one sub on patrol at any given time , both have fewer missiles than american or russian ssbns , and neither of them have a triad . 
  all it takes is someone camping out their patrol box and sinking the sub in question then launching a nuclear attack . 
  the french have another delivery , but none of their nuclear-capable aircraft can reach any worthwhile distance , and in any event they are n't `` alert bombers '' that sit at the end of the runway or flying . 
   germany spends enough to defend itself pretty easy to do when you 're buffered by the poles and are under the us nuclear umbrella . 
   stop starting wars and keep dragging nato countries in there please . 
  which war did we `` drag nato countries into '' ? 
  the only one that i could reasonably say that would be is afghanistan , and given how the vote went it was hardly being `` dragged into it '' . 
   also allowing you to maintain military bases all over our country while you chill across the ocean is pretty generous . 
  the bases were originally there to protect you , and the total number is down to about a quarter what it was in the late 80s . 
  things like reforger do n't happen anymore , and many of the `` bases '' are office parks with uniformed personnel in them . 
  mostly staff officers is hardly `` bases all over the country '' . 
  the real kicker is , if the us really did close up shop in europe , more than a few countries ( including germany ) would interpret that as the us no longer taking nato obligations seriously . 
  this , btw , is exactly what happened in korea . 
  we still have as many personnel in korea as we do in all of europe because the south koreans bitched and moaned that we were trying to wiggle out of our treaty obligations when we started to close down bases left and right . 
   refugees do n't have ** iphones ** and wear levi 's . 
  man if i was gon na go backpacking across europe and i had limited resources a smartphone would be at the absolute top of the list . 
  do people seriously do n't see how stupid `` why would someone * fleeing on foot to another country * want a tiny computer that has maps , a translator , and communication applications ? '', 
  plus there 's , like , three times as many mexicans as there are spaniards . 
  there 's a large basque community in the american west , where they are sometimes referred to as `` high-elevation mexicans '' which makes me chuckle . 
  i do n't really have a point to that story . 
  i went to college ( the first time ) in 2000 , so who knows man . 
  i was/am a bit of a buzzkill , so maybe i 'm not the person to ask about jungle juice though . 
  also , dunno , 2 buck chuck at trader joe 's seems pretty popular . 
  i 'm a beer guy myself though . 
  i do n't really know what `` jungle juice '' is . 
  i do n't think when mexican-americans talk about la raza they are thinking about new spain . 
  we have places like [ this ] ( http://www.latascausa.com/site/ ) near where i live . 
  but i live in a fairly cosmopolitan part of the country , your mileage may vary , significantly , in other parts of the country . 
  to the average american ? 
  yeah , absolutely . 
  mexican culture/cuisine has more or less saturated the country , especially in the southwest . 
  to the point that spanish-cruisine restaurants have learned to include mexican cuisine because that 's what americans think of when they think `` spanish culture '' . 
  if it 's any consolation , the only reason why americans bother to learn spanish is because of mexico , not because of spain . 
  sure . 
  the technology for artificial fill came out of an american dod requirement for it . 
  that might just mean it 's also very heavy , or its not very robust . 
  you start hitting that 1000 $ range for lighter bags with tougher shells . 
  i 'd recommend picking up * killer on the road * , it really is quite common . 
  it just so happens many hitchhikers are transients and so they are n't missed when they disappear . 
  there is a similar situation in western canada as well , it is n't a uniquely american phenomenon . 
   [ question for all ] how common is hitchhiking in your country ? 
  hitchhiking is generally illegal on the freeways in the us . 
  i 've picked up someone in a national park before , and i 've gotten a lift in a national park before as well . 
  you also hear stories that long distance hikers on the triple crown trails do a lot of hitchhiking . 
  for whatever the reason it 's far more acceptable to hitchhike in the context of `` i 'm going to town for a day then coming back to the trail '' rather than just being a drifter . 
  in the rural west it 's a pretty good way to get yourself killed . 
  serial killers frequently pick up hitchhikers for victims , and there is a lot of space with no cell coverage . 
  i think they were quoting someone , it was n't the person writing the article . 
   in urban combat situations you probably end up holding the gun up for 30 mins during one hour of movement . 
  numbers are out of my ass . 
  not exactly shooting position but 0.5 secs away from it . 
  okay , so you 're describing the * one * scenario where bullpups make more sense , and in fact are way the israelis went with the tavor : urban warfare . 
  that said , if you get that heavily worn out with * maybe * lifting an extra half a kilo , then what on earth are you doing in the military ? 
  much less as a grunt ? 
   in situations where there 's a person that does n't respond to commands ( language or just really an enemy ) you might easily also have to hold the gun up for a very long time . 
  no you wo n't . 
  think about it , what scenario is there that you have to keep a firearm pointed at someone for an extended period of time ? 
  prisoners ? 
  why have n't they been zip-tied and are lying on the ground then ? 
   unidentified target , asking for more information/permissions etc. ? 
  you 're standing and holding a weapon up unsupported for such a long time because you need permission to shoot ? 
  if you 're standing and holding a gun up unsupported pointing at something , you 're probably responding to being fired upon ... so no request for permission is needed . 
  if you * are n't * responding to fire , then it sounds like you 're asking permission for a war crime ( shooting a detainee who has not been secured , a non-combatant crossing the street ) or something similar . 
  most scenarios where you are waiting for permission/target identification , you 're in concealment ( and so the rifle is being supported in some manner , even if you 're just leaning against a bulkhead ) or otherwise in a position where you 're resting your rifle on something , even if that something is your arm using your elbows to brace the rifle against the ground . 
  yeah , remember how the germans won ww1 because they had bigger artillery pieces ? 
  no one is swapping out components of rifles during combat situations , that 's a weird thing to say . 
  the modular nature of the ar platform , however , is what has allowed it to be upgraded and refined so much over the years ... to the point that you can even change the action on the gun and create things like the sig mcx and the hk416 . 
   as far as i know , parts of the piston system , none of the parts of the piston system are interchangeable . 
  seriously man , look at how the g36 is charged and look at how the hk416 is charged . 
  if you think about it even medium hard you would realize that they are n't interchangeable . 
  [ take a look at a hk416/iar ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3ecugx8.jpg ) that has been field stripped and that of a [ g36 ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s9cbgiteo1m/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  it looks like there is exactly one component that is really interchangeable , the small silver piston component , and given that the longer stroke part of the piston is different , it seems probable that the small silver component that looks the same is also different . 
   the stock what ? 
  can you be more specific here ? 
  because ... no , the stock ( which is the thing you place up against your shoulder ) absolutely is * not * interchangeable with a hk416 . 
   in a modified version the grip the g36 grip is molded into the lower receiver , it can not be removed . 
  the hk416 pistol grip can be removed and replaced with any ar platform grip . 
  the modular nature of the m-16 platform probably explains it 's longevity in the us military . 
  when ab update happens it 's nearly always done on the upper with the lower being left as is or modified between burst/full auto . 
  `` the sa80 : the gun so bad not even hk could fix it . '', 
  said design has also proven that it 's much , much better at being updated than the famas . 
  there is something i be said for modular rifles . 
  * all * of the lower parts of a hk416 are swappable with a ar platform rifle , at least if said ar is also select fire .
