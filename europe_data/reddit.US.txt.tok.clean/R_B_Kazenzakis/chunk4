  ammo can last a long time , as long as it 's stored properly ( the eastern bloc liked using sealed `` spam cans '' ) . 
  i have some lake city ammo for my garand from the 60s, 
   i am happy the we are selling at least something on the same market as usa and russia . 
  hey man , your zastava rifles and ppu ammo are very popular in the states :p, 
   i bring it up because your entire line of argumentation rests on the baseless assertion that africa was one step short of paradise before the big bad europeans arrived and destroyed this eden . 
  i 'd love for you to point out where i said that . 
   there 's a reason you do n't see people deserting cities to set up tribal societies en masse . 
  european colonial powers * did n't * set up cities and improve them , large ( native ) cities in subsahara africa were there before the race for africa . 
  what europe did was magnify existing tribal problems , spent a hundred years eradicating existing local governments there , and then left when they could no longer afford to pretend they were the top dogs on the global stage . 
  also , i 'd like to remind you that the downvote arrow is not a `` i disagree '' button . 
  sure we can . 
  of course , nato is n't a monolithic bloc , and such deployments mean getting everyone onboard with it . 
  good luck with that . 
  as outsized the us military is compared to the rest of natos , it is n't enough to dictate the foreign policy of all the european nato members . 
  the reverse is also true . 
  it really is . 
  you do realize that that 's basically what you 're advocating , right ? 
  that it 's our `` duty '' to civilize the savages and improve their lot ? 
  otherwise , why even bring it up ? 
   i 'm only `` under the impression '' that you do n't have a whole continent larger than the us trying to build a better life in the us , we routinely have many migrants coming from all the way down the isthmus of panama , not counting boat people from haiti and a persistent trickle from the entire south american continent . 
  it 's incorrect to say that illegal immigrants only arrive from one country that 's smaller in population and land area than the us . 
  we also have so many boat people from east asia that [ human remains are found washed up along the northwest coast fairly routinely ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salish_sea_human_foot_discoveries )  nor a significant population density problem . 
  are you trying to say that illegal migrants go out and carve a home in the wilderness or something ? 
  of course they do n't ; they go to large cities , it 's where jobs and services are . 
  when asylum seekers head to sweden they are n't heading to the woods in lapland , are they ? 
  the white man 's burden is a heavy one . 
  . . well , and oil . 
  okay, 
  strictly speaking , we 're talking about experiences visiting other countries . 
  by necessity , experiences are all `` in the past '' . 
  last time i went to germany was in 2009 , and my work phone did n't have any of that , no . 
  or trying to mentally calculate the currency exchange rate when you use a credit card in a different country . 
  being able to speak the language and not change currency is a huge benefit , 
  or poutine, 
   i 'm chicago and basically i 've been here every day of my life , despite being a great explorer . 
  man , you could n't have been * that * great of a explorer if you 've been stuck in chicago all your life . 
  no offense , but flying from one big city to another big city and hitting all the tourist sites is n't exactly `` exploring '' . 
  of course , i spent my childhood moving around the country a lot ( and sweden ) , my summers literally being driving around great distances and seeing what 's on the route , so ymmv . 
   but not to be culture-centric but what 's a mound to a cathedral * well uh most mounds are places of religious worship , so ... * plenty of 200 + year old missions in the american sw and more than a few 200 + year old churches in the original 13 colonies . 
  bruton parish church is no notre dame , but i mean it 's still a large church , still is in use today , and it was used by people like george washington . 
  * places like yosemite valley , the golden gate bridge , the redwoods , the grand canyon , great smokey mountains are our cathedrals . 
  i 'm ** not ** saying that you should n't have gone to europe ( i 've been/lived there several times , everyone should go ) but i 'm more than a little vexed that you 're acting as if north america is `` missing '' something , especially now that you 've stated you 've remained in one city all your life . 
  edit : man , getting downvoted already . 
  even though i specifically said that i was n't saying he should n't have gone on a trip to europe . 
  serbia is n't ex-eastern bloc ether . 
  yugoslavia managed to maintain a degree of independence from the ussr thanks to tito . 
  out of curiosity , where do you live ? 
  there are many places on the eastcoast and the american southwest that are over 200 years old . 
  heck , there are places in the midwest with structures over 200 years old ( cahokia mounds , for instance ), 
  [ stephen mather is rolling in his grave ] ( http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_social_history/summary/v036/36.4martin.html ), 
   imagine usa having 450-500 million tourists in a year most of our tourists are other americans , one of the benefits to living in a really big country . 
  he can wish it all he wants , the russians are n't going to make the million-man swim to north america . 
  i 'm not saying we would n't get our hair mussed . 
  but i do say no more than ten to twenty million killed , tops . 
  uh , depending on the breaks . '', 
  nations that view themselves as world powers do n't limit their cares to their immediate neighbors . 
  russia would n't spend cash on things like aircraft carriers ( and more specifically , deploying them ) if they did n't care about countries that they did n't share mutual borders with . 
  if you guys are ever in the bay area , drive up and see it . 
  it is n't very well known as a tourist destination as other spots , but the views are gorgeous and they 've done a great job reconstructing the site . 
   so you did n't pay ... ? 
  ... like you guys ? 
  do you know what `` tu quoque '' means ? 
  that is n't a valid argument . 
   no , we do n't have the money . 
  you absolutely do . 
   we will not raise taxes by $ 30b just to spend money on weapons we do n't need . 
  considering you guys keep coming up with the money to bail out other eu countries , and you do it without raising taxes significantly , i highly doubt you need to significantly raise taxes to come up with the money . 
   we can not even agree to raise taxes by $ 5b to repair our autobahn bridges . 
  whoop-de-do , here in virginia we have the same argument with a mass transit expansion . 
  a lot of countries `` can not even agree '' on relatively small amounts . 
  `` only one `` of the founding members that 's also one of the big three using different ammo , so that 's a big deal . 
  france is n't some inconsequential country like one of the low countries . 
  this does n't count many of the former warsaw pact countries are still using combloc stuff as well . 
  despite decades of efforts there is n't as much standardization as you 'd think . 
   well , did you pay your dues ? 
  not fines , just what you ow ah , you caught me . 
  i said `` fines '' instead of `` dues '' because your post was in response to a `` fines '' thing . 
  and yes , what you did was a tu quoque thing . 
   nobody said it is n't embarrassing , but spending more than we do is just too expensive it may be * expensive * but that is not the same thing as * too * expensive . 
  germany does have the money , you just do n't want to spend it . 
  and that 's * perfectly fine * , but if that 's the case maybe you should n't expect other countries to defend you if you wo n't do the bare , agreed-upon minimum to be part of the club . 
   that 's called `` evading the question '' . 
  and what you did was called `` tu quoque '' when you went `` hurr pay un fines ''  spening 1.3 % of gdp is definitely not underfunding you guys ca n't even keep 1/10th of your [ fighter fleet ] ( http://www.armedforces-int.com/news/report-shortfalls-ground-germanys-aircraft.html ) operational . 
  * maybe * you are n't underfunding your military , but if the money is there then you have serious , serious structural and institutional problems . 
   in europe there are literally dozens of small armies i really wish that more europeans would realize this instead of trotting out the `` but on paper we spend * x * more than russia total ! '', 
  every thread that defense spending pops up in . 
  even worse , nato has struggled to create a `` standard '' system ( sometimes the us ended really throwing the europeans under the bus on that , like the 7.62 nato debacle ) and even `` standard '' equipment , is n't . 
  france ca n't use the same 5.56 ammo that everyone else uses , because the famas only eats steel cased ammo . 
  that such a problem still exists 50 + years after the alliance was formed is absurd . 
   not to mention that nato as a whole spend tenfold the amount of what russia does . 
  nato as a whole also has far more than tenfold the general staff , intelligence apparatus , logistical needs , and often the equipment is n't necessarily compatible with other countries equipment , nato standardization be damned . 
  hell , france ca n't even use the same 5.56 nato ammo ( the standard rifle round ! ), 
  as everyone else because their rifle needs steel cased ammo . 
  not counting the enormous purchasing power difference . 
  russia is still getting most of their procurement and r&d from russian industries , and paying russian salaries for that means bigger boom for the buck . 
  well , the germans could [ decimate and experiment upon lesser races ] ( http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/vanir ) to improve their own society ... wait ... shit . 
  nevermind . 
  we do n't want that . 
   it 's a good thing this was made public ** now ** , so it can be addressed this has been common knowledge to anyone who has interacted with the bundeswehr for years . 
  during my 2004-05 deployment it was like pulling teeth working with german naval vessels , compared to ( most ) other coalition vessels .
