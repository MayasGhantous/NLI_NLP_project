  superior is the next 51st state !, 
   it may seem like a fine distinction but it 's important - especially to the non-nato countries that were talked into not opposing the vote . 
  it 's worth noting that the arab league okayed it as well , and we had non-nato countries ( the uae and qatar ) involved . 
  the un is n't the end-all be-all for international legitimacy . 
   the military of european countries is sufficient to ensure the safety of its territoy on its own it is n't quite strong enough to engage in big military operations outside of the continent ( see libya ) holy cats . 
  libya was * not * a big military operation . 
  it had a thirdrate air defense network that europeans * still * could n't penetrate without the us kicking the door in . 
  the british started having problems with munitions availability within weeks , despite the very low sortie rate compared to the balkans in the 90s . 
  the europeans had trouble dealing with a country whose conventional army was defeated by a bunch of dudes [ with pickup trucks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chadian%e2%80%93libyan_conflict ) . 
  and you call it a `` big military operation '' ? 
  libya should have been a wakeup call as to how thoroughly screwed the european militaries are . 
  at least it saved carrier aviation for the rn , but no one else seemed to have learned from it . 
  here we are in august 2014 and the german air force is [ in a incredibly poor state ] ( http://www.armedforces-int.com/news/report-shortfalls-ground-germanys-aircraft.html ) . 
  yeah , i 'm sure the germans are going to be able to defend their country with 9 eurofighters . 
  oh wait , that 's right . 
  the germans * do n't * expect to be doing any of the fighting if they need to . 
  the expectation is that the english-speakers and french will bail their asses out . 
  sure . 
  problem is twofold : * cruise missiles tend to be sorta range , only the us has done work on truly intercontinental range cruise missiles ( the navaho cruise missile ) . 
  * the tomahawk is the only cruise missile that 's really out there that meets that requirement , and it 's old ( more vulnerable to modern air defenses ) , limited capacity , and when the us sells it they usually attache a lot of restrictions to it 's use . 
  * israeli has gone the submarine-launched cruise missile route for their deterrence , but it 's substantially shorter range even than a tomahawk * because of the expense/technological hurdles of developing such a long range missile , the uk opted to buy into the trident , and france opt to develop the less risky m5 . 
  edit : okay , that 's like , 4-fold . 
  or multifold . 
  i do n't count very well . 
   does the us have anything in the megaton + range still probably , but not the numbers as before , or as large of yields . 
  just like everything else it 's more about precision these days . 
  the days of `` we need to take out this railyard , try to get a 3 megaton warhead within a kilometer of it '' are long gone . 
   i would have imagined that trident launched from near the uk would have the option of following a depressed trajectory , which might make it harder to hit for the russians ? 
  i would imagine the opposite , actually . 
  the closer you are , the steeper the climb . 
  someone smarter than me may come along and correct me though . 
  but you guys are far enough away from russia that you do n't have to worry about them trying to knock anything out of the air during the boost phase , which is when ballistic missiles are most vulnerable ( it 's why whenever the norks test a icbm japanese ships crowd the east coast of the korean peninsula , aegis bmd can knock stuff out of the air during boost phase fine ) . 
   killing people that are no threat to you , except they were . 
  the atomic bombings were part of the strategic bombing campaign in the pacific , and that was important to make sure our troops had a easier time during the anticipated invasion . 
  that meant preventing the ija from being as well equipped as possible . 
  we ( the us ) switched to area bombing because all the major industrial sites and been knocked to rubble and the japanese switched to a cottage industry . 
  i 'll add that the raf bomber command in europe * specifically targeted * `` workers domiciles '' ( in otherwords , civilian homes ) in order to instill terror and truancy in the german population . 
  the us did no such thing . 
  here is curtis lemay ( the american commander of the bombing campaign over japan ) talking about why we switched to area bombing . 
  and it was n't to kill civilians for the hell of it . 
   no point in slaughtering civilians for the mere sake of slaughter . 
  of course , there is a pretty thin veneer in japan , but the veneer was there . 
  it was their system of dispersal of industry ... i 'll never forget yokohama . 
  that was what impressed me : drill presses . 
  there they were , like a forest of scorched trees and stumps , growing up throughout that residential area . 
  flimsy construction all gone ... every house burned down , or up , and drill presses standing like skeletons, 
   come talk to me about this on the 4th of july oh , you mean when the colonies * did n't * have representation in parliament ? 
  and scotland today not only has representation in the national legislature , but has it 's own as well ? 
  yes , the two instances are exact parallels . 
  obviously . 
  by the way , george washington , james madison , and alexander hamilton all felt that rebellion was illegal in a representative democracy . 
  which is what the scots have . 
   and are you saying a nuclear deterrent controlled by eu would be worry free when it comes to politics ? 
  how did you get that ? 
  i said the french are going to look out for the french . 
  nope . 
  we have a few hundred minuteman icbmss . 
  we have about 70 b-52s and 20 b-2s . 
  it 's easier than you think to make the 60-odd b-1bs we have become `` nuclear capable '' . 
  so , global strike command has a rather substantial ownership of nuclear delivery platforms . 
  not counting miscellaneous delivery platforms . 
  i 've been on a ( ** simulated ** ) exercise for a tlam-n , even though we took it out of service in the first bush administration . 
  no doubt in my mind there are some gathering dust in a naval weapons depot somewhere . 
   bombers are easy to shoot down b-52s would n't be flying within range of russian air defenses , they would fly to a certain point and then launch cruise missiles that can fly 1200 nautical miles or so . 
  b-2s would n't , but they are substantially less vulnerable than the b-52 . 
  unlike icbms and slbms , which are highly visible ( you are n't going to hide something going mach 5 , sorry ) and whose trajectories are largely dictated by gravity , a long range bomber force has a lot more flex in operations . 
  maybe they can be called off entirely ( no such thing as self-destruct sequences for production icbms/slbms ) . 
  they can be redirected to other targets . 
  they are going to either be difficult to identify on a radar screen , or are going to have a ew suite far beyond any countermeasures that could be crammed on a icbm/slbm . 
  bombers are a * far * superior delivery system if you 're willing to pay for it . 
  most countries are n't . 
  a base on each coast , so a minimum of two on patrol . 
  the usn has 14 boomers compared to the rns 4 , so i strongly suspect it 'll be more than 2 . 
  it is very , very difficulty to do a straight ship to ship comparison . 
  iirc ohios carry more missiles than vanguards , which no doubt offsets the individual warhead numbers . 
  it gets even murkier when you consider the possibility that either class does n't always sail with the full allotment of missiles/warheads . 
  on the whole , i 'd say `` about equal '' and leave it at that . 
  it 's a reasonable one . 
  again , it really does sound as if scotland is just whining about not getting their own way in a democracy . 
  its the uk version of `` states rights '' . 
   it is their right to change their mind and want to leave it if that 's what they want . 
  yes , it is . 
  i never disputed it . 
  that said , if they 're going to tell the rest of the uk to get fucked over minor issues , expect there to be a lot of hurt feelings . 
  metropolitan france is bigger , although not absurdly so , and they had ground-based delivery systems up until the 90s . 
  and the uk has very uneven population density compared to france . 
  it 's about warning . 
  what might be a 15-20 minute warning for the us would be a less than a 5 minute warning ( a lot less , since you have to go through ** a lot ** of verification to make sure it is n't a false alarm and you are n't the one accidentally starting ww3 ) for both france and the uk . 
  the uk and france simply do n't have the same luxury of time that geography grants the us or russia . 
  rather than spending the money for a continuous airborne element , the uk opted for a fistful of ssbns . 
  the end result is the entire effective british nuclear arsenal is on whichever * vanguard * is on patrol . 
   they have some control over their internal affairs , they want complete control . 
  it 's their right . 
  oh , come on . 
  it 's like saying texas should have * complete * control over it 's affairs because `` it 's their right '' . 
  the difference being that edinburgh is a helluva lot closer to london than austin is to dc , which argues for a * stronger * central government , not a weaker one . 
  well , the scots telling the rest of the british to get fucked over what ( appears to me across the pond ) to be minor things will do that . 
  i mean , i was under the impression that the scottish already had a lot of control over their internal affairs ? 
  at a certain point it becomes `` i do n't like how the majority wishes it , i 'm talking my ball and going home '' . 
  as far as i 'm aware , they have n't withdrawn from new start .
