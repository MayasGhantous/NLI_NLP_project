  some russki lawmakers have proposed to suspend it , but that 's about as meaningful as the same pack of american lawmakers who try to introduce bills to withdraw from the un every year . 
   but subs are scary as shit . 
  uk could have a sub sitting right outside st. petersburg right this second . 
  they would n't though , the whole point of the trident program was that usn ssbns could `` patrol '' from off the coast of north america . 
   you ca n't track a sub like a bomber trying to fly across alaska or canada . 
  * you still can track them . 
  a russian submarine getting close to the us coast would be incredibly dangerous for it ( just like a usn submarine getting close to the russian coast would ) . 
  the trident missile was developed so american ssbns could operate in relative safety near the coast of their home country . 
  before that , the polaris and poseidon systems required that that operate much , much closer to the ussr . 
  * a icbm , which is how the sub delivers its payload , is far , far , far more visible than even a b-52 or bear bomber . 
  a modern bomber , or even the cruise missiles those older bombers launch ( usually from well over a thousand miles away ) are even less visible than a icbm . 
  you ca n't hide something goigg mach 5 , sorry . 
  and unlike a bomber or cruise missile , it 's trajectory is more or less dictated by gravity . 
  we were doing mission kills ( including a undisclosed number of skin-to-skin hits ) on icbms in the late 60s/early 70s with the old nike program . 
  the russkis use nuclear warheads on their abm systems to get around the problems we 've faced with ours , and their abm system covers most of european russia . 
  ours covers , uh , alaska and california . 
  bombers are better , i 'd say ( you can exert a lot more operational control on strikes that way , harder to defend against than icbms and slbms ) . 
  at least if you keep them airborne at all times , or even as alert bombers at the end of a runway . 
  even today when we task our b-52s to go to alert status we can get them airborne in less than 15 minutes , although that is n't common at all except during exercises . 
  incredibly expensive to keep them airborne though , and if you 're someone like the uk where the warning of a incoming nuclear attack is less than 5 minutes , it does n't make a lot of sense to keep them on the ground ready to go . 
   are you telling me the entire arsenal of uk goes on one sub ? 
  go check . 
  they have 4 ssbns so one can be on patrol at any given time . 
  they do n't have nearly the number of tridents `` leased '' from us to fill four subs , so your theoretical maximum is three * vanguards * . 
  that 's off the initial purchase ; given the state of the mods finances , your guess is as good as mine as to how much many are actually functional . 
  the uk does n't have air-launched nukes anymore , and has n't had icbms since ... the 60s ? 
  so the entire nuclear arsenal rests on whichever sub is at sea . 
  let 's be generous and say there 's some kind of international event and there are two subs at sea . 
  it still is n't a lot compared to the us , russia , and china . 
  in addition france , india , and israel have more diversified sets of delivery systems . 
   there is no freaking way france would give a shit if some city in the baltic was nuked . 
  that 's my point , france likely is n't going to have a nuclear exchange over tallinn if they can avoid it . 
   the british deterrent is a bit of a joke though , it is so tightly integrated into the us military . 
  nah , that is n't what makes it a joke . 
  what makes it a joke is having everything essentially available on whatever submarine happens to be at sea at one time . 
  it 's enough to get through the defenses around moscow and that 's it . 
  and the whole deterrence is built around the assumption that the one sub at sea * ca n't * be found and sunk . 
  it 's very , very dicey putting all your eggs in one basket . 
  non-triad nuclear arsenals are complete jokes . 
  even israel has ground based missiles , air dropped bombs/missiles , and a submarine-based delivery system . 
   anyways france is a full fledged member of europe , hard to see how it is n't already the european nuclear deterrent depends if france is going to always be willing to trade paris for , to pick a city at random , warsaw . 
  as long as it 's the * french * nuclear arsenal , you always have to worry about politics . 
   icbms and other nuclear weapons are worthless without a delivery method . 
  icbms ** are ** a delivery method , you nincompoop . 
  a delivery method for nuclear warheads . 
   absolutely disgusted . 
  even if the us was attacked first , for me , their use of 2 nuclear weapons on cities , is equal to the holocaust . 
  explicitly targeting civilians for the hell of it is not in anyway comparable to the strategic bombing campaign and blockade carried out by us and commonwealth forces in the pacific during ww2 . 
  i would recommend reading * downfall : the end of the imperial japense empire * by richard frank for a discussion of how the us got to the point of dropping atomic weapons on japan . 
  and it was n't because of `` just because '' , which is the level of thought you 're implying went into it . 
   `` if you completely destroy my country and kill all my citizens , i 'll do the same to you '' let 's make this clear : at no point did american or soviet nuclear planners sit down and plan a war for that . 
  what they * did * plan was having sufficient numbers in their respective arsenals that they could absorb a first strike and still be able to fight . 
  it 's why the numbers of the us and russian ( and to a lesser degree , chinese ) arsenals are so large and why the british & french deterrence is dubious . 
  mad is not , and has never been a policy of the big five . 
  it 's been the * result * of policies promulgated by strategic planners ( sac in the us , strategic rocket forces in the ussr ) . 
  jackasses like mcnamara in the us came up with the phrase and it stuck . 
  good luck . 
  but besides the problems of just unifying the various european militaries into one unit , there are immense political problems associated with it . 
  * france and the uk are the only two countries that are nuclear-friendly enough to pull this off . 
  someone like germany ( which is the biggest economy in the eu ) seems to be against all things nuclear on principle . 
  so you have to clear the general anti-nuclear bias just to get off the ground . 
  * nuclear weapons are viewed ( incorrectly , imo ) as a `` relic '' . 
  so much so that scotland is flat out kicking the uks deterrence out of the country when it secedes . 
  you 'll have to convince people who have n't fought anyone other than assholes in the mountains with aks in the past 40 years that such a system is worth the cost . 
  and in order for it to be truly effective , you 'd probably need multiple delivery systems rather than just sticking it on a sub and calling it a day . 
  * a `` eu-deterrent '' essentially marries all the member countries into a general nuclear/exchange , even if they do n't want to be part of it . 
  * russia may exit current nuclear weapons treaties if the eu creates a unified nuclear deterrent . 
  presumably it would be larger than the existing british or french one ( hopefully bigger than combined ) , and when that happens russia will be less willing to measure their nuclear numbers against the usa 's . 
   is the us still paying somehow for their indians ? 
  yeah , it 's called the [ bureau of indian affairs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bureau_of_indian_affairs ) , in addition american indians as a group get ancillary benefits like reservations that operate as jurisdictions outside of the state , affirmative action , lowered tuition costs for university , free healthcare through the ihs , etc. 
  i 'm ** not ** saying that all that is bad or sufficient ( i think we should be spending more ) , i * am * saying that under any stretch of the definition of the word `` paying '' the us government ( minus state governments ) is indeed `` still paying somehow for their indians '' . 
  it is n't even unusual for conservatives to generally be in favor of expanded social programs/autonomy for indians and tribal governments while knocking social services for the general population , such is the feeling of `` we done fucked up '' . 
  by the way , the last `` indian battle '' was in the 1890s , so you 're really making a stretch with that comparing it to germany that invaded its neighbors twice in the 20th century . 
   you went there to defeat the talebans . 
  strictly speaking , there are a lot of americans that say we went there to round up the leadership of those responsible for 9/11 . 
  nation-building made it a easier environment to do that than not . 
   that 's the attitude i do n't understand . 
  how someone can be so fond of scots in the union , but so hostile if they 're out . 
  if they do n't want anything to do with me ( besides , apparently , my money ) do n't be surprised if i do n't want anything to do with them . 
  it 's a pretty common attitude , and as much as we like to pretend otherwise , nations are basically people on a grand scale . 
  i would be very surprised indeed if scotland and the uk do away with borderless travel . 
  but that was n't what he was talking about : he was talking about not aiding the scots financially and gutting the uks military for them when the ( presumed ) future political leadership of scotland is on record of saying they 'll do what they can to hurt the uk on the way out . 
   that was not the experience of other nations that left the union or the empire . 
  well , to pick the biggest one ( india ) there was a huge turnover in military equipment and such because , frankly , the uk did n't need what was in india to defend india anymore . 
  other nations that left the empre were n't part of the island of great britain and so there was a similar turn over of military equipment and such and in any event those nations never had democratic representation in the uk parliament ( the scottish did and have ) so there was a tinge of `` trying to make things right '' . 
  the best parallel would be ireland . 
  ireland had `` treaty ports '' that the rn could use for decades after they left , meanwhile the snp is saying `` get your ass out '' to the uk with regards to military facilities . 
  all while the military needs of the uk will not materially change . 
  just from a military viewpoint the snp is looking to dick over the rest of the uk , and it 's really hard to not fall into a `` one bad turn deserves another '' viewpoint when something like that happens . 
   i reckon we need the welsh dragon in there somewhere . 
  a little saint george slaying it . 
  i believe that the current flag is heavily invested with symbolic representation of the constituent countries of the uk . 
  for example , the blue is from the scottish flag . 
  cromwell and the potato famine were * exactly * like the holocaust i read it in a tom clancy novel, 
   have to say i do n't really understand this all or nothing approach . 
  if they do n't care enough about the relationship to stay in , why should one partner continue to support them after they leave ? 
  seriously , it 's like asking `` i do n't understand why the boyfriend ( or girlfriend ) should n't be forced to pay for the new living arrangements for the ex girlfriend/boyfriend '' . 
  usually , when a relationship ends , the onus is on the one who wanted it to end to have a exit strategy , not the other partner . 
  [ this is n't true ] ( http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1916/whats-the-story-on-north-american-earthworms ) , or at least , not more true than , say , introducing dogs to north america . 
   first off , all of north america was not scraped down to bare rock during the ice ages , and that 's about what it would take to wipe out all the earthworms .
