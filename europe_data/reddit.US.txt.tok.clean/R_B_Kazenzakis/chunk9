  it might be fair to say that much of canada was stripped of its native earthworms last time around , but relatively little of the u.s. , and none of mexico , was affected . 
   second , the native worms are n't being wiped out . 
  there are currently 17 native species and 13 european species in the eastern united states , lumbricus terrestris being the most common import , and in many areas the dominant species in the topsoil . 
  the native species may be less abundant than they once were , but if they were going to be `` ousted , '' they 'd be gone by now . 
  i 'm not wrong . 
  the libyan intervention made the uk government look rather silly considering the recent axing of the * ark royal * . 
  the raf had trouble flying all the way from the uk for sorties and had to rely heavily on american tanker aircraft , and the problem was exasperated by prepping for suitable facilities closer to libya ( greece and southern italy ) . 
  the french , meanwhile , managed to squeeze some use out of the cdg which was impressive because she was coming off a scheduled deployment and heading into a scheduled maintenance period . 
  it 's why the * ocean * as put to use in the manner she was ; a floating airbase provided more reliable facilities withe quicker turnaround even with apache helicopters ... and she arrived on scene * late * in the intervention . 
  and the kicker is ? 
  the british government did something ** very ** similar in the early 80s . 
  they agreed to sell off the nearly new * invincible * to the ran , then the falklands happened , and the thatcher government looked so stupid that the rn lucked out and carrier aviation was saved . 
  edit : that post history . 
  and born in 1995 too . 
  good lord . 
   those are all good , but the queen elizabeth ? 
  historically in the rn large capital ships were named after the sitting monarch ( and the current one has been on the throne longer than most ) . 
  there have been [ many ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_prince_of_wales ) ships named prince of wales . 
  names are important , it 's why you read so many usn watchers bemoaning naming carriers purely to get them funded . 
  would you rather be on a carrier named after the ship john paul jones commanded , or [ some asshole who was for racial segregation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_c._stennis#civil_rights_record ) ? 
  high bar to live up to , that . 
   wait why are n't our big floating death ships nuclear powered ? 
  * reactors ( and trained personnel ) are very , very expensive . 
  adding a reactor immediately adds hundreds of millions of dollars to it . 
  the usn opted to restart the * arleigh burke * line rather than design a new surface combatant from scratch after the * zumwalts * because there 's actually a congressionally mandate out there that the next new large surface combatant has to be nuclear powered . 
  $ 750mil was the number being thrown around as the cost increase of a '' * arleigh burke * , but nuclear powered '' . 
  admittedly , this means there 's less lifetime fuel costs and if enough ships are nuclear powered than the fleet train can be reduced ... but the initial capital costs are enormous and that 's what democracies look to cut when defense cuts are made . 
  * there are political problems involved with nuclear-powered ships . 
  / u/slyratchet in his response to you encapsulated it perfectly : people are unreasonably afraid of nuclear powered vessels and some countries flat out will not let them hit port . 
  you guys are getting two lhds and are n't even hiding the fact that the ran plans to use the f-35b off of them eventually . 
  you do n't take ski-jump ships unless you 're dead set on fixed-wing aviation . 
  the ski-jumps take up too much valuable deckspace otherwise . 
   i have a feeling it is to appease those criticising the government/mod for going to far with the cuts . 
  it 's because the * ark royal * was retired early , and so was the harrier fleet ... and then when the libyan intervention happened the raf had difficulty providing sorties congruent with its `` paper '' strength . 
  the uk was forced to use the * ocean * as ersatz-light carrier with apaches . 
  the intervention probably saved carrier aviation in the rn . 
  and most of them are still thousands of kilometers away from the east coast of russia . 
  the industrial parts of russia , the parts that will be making the stuff that goes boom for fighting wars , will be in european russia and fairly close to where the fighting is . 
  two things : * incredibly vast majority of russia 's wealth and population comes from european russia , so the far east is going to be on the back burner no matter what . 
  the us , by contrast , has several major population centers ( and oil states like california and alaska ) on the west coast . 
  * the us is going to be under far more domestic pressure to `` cover the homeland , all of it '' than russia . 
  democracies have to worry about that sort of thing ... whatever russia is wo n't . 
  russia will win or lose the conflict in europe . 
  right , but the point of this was i was responding to a scenario where they did intervene in the baltics and somehow a nuclear exchange did n't happen . 
   is n't a lot of russia 's military hardware old and their regular army just 100-200k troops though ? 
  * do n't confuse `` old '' with `` out of date '' . 
  i served on a usn surface combatant that was older than me and was more capable than many nato surface combatants . 
  * figure 200k troops , but the problem would be that they have a better trained/equipped army and air force than what we ( nato ) typically face . 
   would n't a highly technologically superiour force of 100 000 entrenched soldiers be able to halt the russians ? 
  maybe , but the technological gap is n't as big as you 'd think ( it was n't as big during the persian gulf war between iraq and coalition forces ) . 
  russian troops are going to be better trained than the sort of people nato has been fighting for the past few years . 
  i just said this in the post you 're responding to . 
  stop thinking of russia as someone who is on the level of iraq or libya . 
   if russia had problems invading chechnya you mean dcoming on 20 years ago ? 
  because the second cechen war was a rousing success . 
  and the russians rolled georgia in 2008 despite never having local ground superiority in numbers and not having undisputed control of the air , against a army that the us had invested a lot of time and effort in training . 
   how on earth would they attack the most powerful military power to ever exist which `` power '' ? 
  the us ? 
  if we have to fight a war with russia to eject them from a nato country , you can bet your ass a lot of us ( and canadian ) aerial assets are going to remain in north america precisely * because * russia is one of the few countries out there than can reach out on touch someone like the us can . 
  european countries would be under a similar pressure to keep their own , rather paltry , air assets home after such a war . 
  it does n't look good if russia can , say , bomb a base outside of berlin . 
   you would n't need half a million soldiers in eastern europe we needed half a million ( more , counting other coalition forces ) to kick the iraqis out of kuwait , and a quarter of a million to topple the hussein regime . 
  the russians are going to be much tougher nut to crack than a army of illiterates who come from a culture that the * soviets * thought showed lack of initiative and imagination . 
   station 100 000 soldiers there with good air support maybe that could be a deterrent ( although i do n't think so ) , it does n't solve the problem of * ejecting * the russians if they try to militarily intervene in the baltics . 
  you 'd need many more troops than that , and frankly i do n't think most of the nato countries are up to it . 
  the war would be carried by the anglos , french , with a smattering of danes . 
   never get through unless they used nukes why ? 
  because you said so ? 
  there 's a attitude i see repeated that `` nato '' ( which is code for `` the anglos and french ) '' is able to roll anyone in a fight . 
  and they base this largely on our performance in past wars against countries that , well , are n't even in the same league as us . 
  russia is . 
  100k `` with good air support '' is n't much against a country like russia . 
   for perapective , the us already has 60 000 soldiers in europe . 
  i know , i work for the us dod . 
  and for perspective , most of them are n't combat arms . 
  10 years ago it would have been different ; it is n't ten years ago . 
  and mention us troop levels emphasizes what myself ( and other americans ) have been saying : a lot of europeans are assuming that the us will ride to their rescue so they do n't spend as much on defense as they should . 
  ironically , one of the few countries that meet the nato requirements for defense spending is greece . 
  i am ** not ** saying that if a nato country is attacked we ( the us ) should ignore our treaty obligations . 
  i ** am ** saying it 's frustrating as hell to observe a some of our illustrious allies spending decades digging themselves into a hole and then bank on a lot of dead americans to bail their asses out . 
  and if you think that , say , guarding contractors digging wells in a quiet sector of afghanistan is at all comparable to what 's being asked in the scenario presented above ... well , i do n't know what to say . 
   as long as nato operations are limited to repelling the russian invasion okay , then what ? 
  nato has kicked russia out of the baltics . 
  what 's the end game here ? 
  keep half a million nato troops in the baltics forever ? 
  how long until people are no longer willing to pay for the increased military funding ? 
  war-weariness * is * a thing , you know . 
  germany wo n't even fund their military to the point where they have a stock of spares to keep more than ten typhoons operational , we 're to believe that , say , 5 years after the conflict fund will be there to keep sufficient nato forces forward deployed ? 
  how long after that until russia decides on a do-over ? 
  sounds crazy , but hey , we 're talking about a scenario where russia thinks it can get away with intervening militarily in a nato state , so it is n't much crazier than that . 
  edit : already getting downvoted for asking the obvious question . 
   are you saying that us should not help why should we ? 
  you want in the club , join the club . 
  do n't expect club benefits without joining though . 
   when russia attacks finland ? 
  this seems to be operating on the assumption that russia has plans to in the immediate future . 
  finland has it 's shit together compared to ukraine , and can probably put up more of a fight than ukraine has thus far . 
  there is no area of finland that was crawling with russian personnel * before * the fighting started like ukraine had . 
  a better military position for finland and a worse logistical one for russia reduces the odds of a invasion on the part of russia . 
   but there is a possibility that he goes for kazakhstan honestly , kazakhstan is tied in more closely to russia than ukraine ever was .
