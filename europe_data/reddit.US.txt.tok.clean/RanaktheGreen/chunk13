  its right there , `` palesti '' . 
  however , from what i understand , chinese is usually romanized based on german , while japanese is romanized based on english . 
  but it was n't the finns who introduced `` finland '' so they 'd only know finland by finland , thus the finrando . 
  that 's because whenever japan tries to use a foreign word , they default to trying to pronounce it as closely as they could from the origin of where they heard the word , so if it was the americans who first introduced finland to japan , than they would try to make finland more usable to japanese , thus \u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9 \u3002 its even got its own alphabet specifically for foreign words !, 
  for comparison , here 's `` finrando '' written in the `` native '' alphabet : \u3075\u3043\u3093\u3089\u3093\u3069 \u3002 see how the foreign alphabet is more blocky ? 
  that 's how you can tell whether or not you can try and figure out what the word means by how it sounds ( typically english with some exceptions ) . 
  we are more a bastardization of german , and gaelic . 
  which then added french . 
  and later added spanish cause german and french tasted funny and we needed some spice . 
  only for foreign words !, 
  they even have a whole alphabet dedicated just for spelling foreign words !, 
  d'awww , thanks china !, 
  but they are not !, 
  japanese uses subscripts for part of their alphabet !, 
  so ( example given ) \u308a\u3086 ( riyu ) is different than \u308a\u3085 ( ryu ), 
  huh , i guess japan also forgot there is more to holland than holland . 
  completely off the bants at this point : during world war 2 for the united states the german culture which pervaded the midwest was absolutely decimated because of peer pressure and outside influences . 
  it simply was n't a good idea to be a `` german '' american anymore , and so they stylized themselves as `` neutral '' americans . 
  which is partially why nowadays the `` plain '' americans are the ones who live in ohio , michigan , illinois and the like . 
  though there has been a small resurgence , there is significantly less `` german '' in german america than there was prior to world war 2 . 
  er ... uh ... 
  i think i just got taught a bit about poe 's law ... 
  ohh ... low blow man . 
  low blow . 
  top bants though , well done !, 
  how about neither :d, 
  you know what 's west of europe ? 
  ` merica . 
  the west 's west has its own west . 
  seems someone 's never been to / r/murica . 
  guess that 's what happens when you 're ashamed your people have never been to the moon . 
  wow that hurt . 
  but hey ... at least our country exists `` north brabent '' . 
  no one told the canadians `` do n't rock the boat . '', 
  instead of hoping for a power vacuum to form if/when the us becomes insignificant , i 'm planning on moving somewhere that is . 
  the uk is near the top of the list actually . 
  shhhhhhhh . 
  we do n't talk about that since the war ... 
  oh poe you bastard . 
   in science we trust . 
  does n't trust science about gmos . 
  well uk , next time you want us to save you and the rest of europe from germany maybe we just wo n't show up !, 
  how about that !, 
  you know what ? 
  what if we help germany take over europe . 
  what 'll you do then huh ? 
  yeah . 
  what 's their pension plan ? 
  want to see an entire country collectively get whiplash ? 
  be around for a change in power . 
  just like the tiger ii, 
  ... have you ever read a german fairy tale ? 
  i was raised on that shit . 
  this carnival stuff is light . 
  no edit history on that comment . 
  you missed it . 
  but do n't feel stupid . 
  your country did n't elect him after all . 
  do n't get involved . 
  we do n't need germany and austria flipping their shit again . 
  let the balkans be balkans . 
  oh no ... not again . 
  greece is , as they were on debt payments , a bit late . 
  once again the swiss fail english 101 . 
  his comment is from an american perspective , looking at the european union from an america focused foreign policy lens . 
  `` what would be the best europe for america ? '', 
  would be a good way to describe the question this comment attempts to answer . 
  and the answer is : make it clear , are we negotiating with a 16.7 trillion dollar gdp , 500 million person superpower , or are we negotiating with greece . 
  not this `` negotiating with representatives on behalf of the superpower where you may only get about a quarter of what you actually expected because this country here denied the plan but this one did and so now you need to enter negotiations with ^ these ^ ^ people ^ ^ ^ over ^ ^ ^ ^ here '', 
  hey man , if you want to compare our union to your union , federalize first . 
  or ... you know ... trying to get karma ? 
  no need to be so malicious . 
  it kinda is . 
  see , the military is supposed to serve not the president , but the constitution , and the constitution says only congress can declare war , and with nuking being an act of war it gets into grey area if its one of the things the president can do during the one ( ish ) month period he is allowed to wage war without congressional approval . 
  not that all of this matters because if some officer is n't bright enough to say `` nah , i 'll just go to jail fuck this '' over ending the world than maybe we have other problems . 
  but then again , in that situation , all problems everywhere will be solved in about 11 minutes . 
  no more man , no more problem . 
  40 iirc , but the president is still responsible for answering to the actions and all actions must be presented to congress within 24 hours of the order being given . 
  misleading . 
  it was one of the potential ways of dealing with the war in vietnam , it was merely discussed in the same way the us discussed painting mt. 
  fuji red during world war 2 . 
  we also discussed using nukes to win korea . 
  he could authorize it , but all it takes is someone who is responsible for actually doing it to say `` nah fuck you '' and crisis adverted cold war style . 
  no no ... america first . 
  but the eu second . 
   most of her supporters are die hard though . 
  oh no ... not again . 
  that 's abbreviated !? 
  oich ... logographic languages are confusing . 
  you see this ? 
  this is why people make fun of us . 
  pretty sure rice is a cereal . 
  [ looks like it is . 
  ] ( https://www.britannica.com/plant/rice ), 
  uhh ... switzerland , the fuck do you even eat ? 
  i hope the nyt and washington post find something quickly ... 
  do n't say that !, 
  some poor german is going to check and get arrested for spreading nazism . 
  fair . 
  we do n't really use those definitions cause they are out dated .
