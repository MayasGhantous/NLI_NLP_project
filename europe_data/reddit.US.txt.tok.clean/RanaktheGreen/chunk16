  hey now : we tried our damnedest . 
  if a 3 million margin is n't enough to win an election than what is !, 
  no one with power really supports the intelligentsia . 
  cause the point was not to compare the highest homicide rates , but the states who famously are very pro gun and very anti gun . 
  it was comparing two places of similar homicide rates but completely different views on guns . 
  though i did mention louisiana and mississippi and the comment chain with the swede . 
  do n't worry ... 
  i made the same mistake in my uni us history course . 
  its terrible . 
  pretty sure that 's how canada got its independence in the first place . 
  in that context , it was contradicting the original point of the first commenter that the homicide rate in the us was caused by gun access . 
  by providing examples which show homicide rate being independent of gun access , it countered the original claim that it was all gun access . 
  which was my original point in the first place , you 're the one who decided to be well ... a bit rude . 
  errr ... might want to reread the comment mate in regards to washington . 
   washinton state ( emphasis added ) i tried so hard to prevent that confusion too : / california may have dense areas , but so too does texas . 
  cali and texas make great comparisons for what would happen if the us went extreme right vs extreme left . 
  they both have heavily populated areas , major industries , farms/ranches , busy commercial areas , it really is a comparison made in heaven . 
  they even have similar immigration issues and we can test how different responses have different effects thanks to the autonomy of the states . 
  relatively even numbers of what ? 
  cause it certainly is n't states ( or counties/wards ) , and it certainly is n't by rate . 
  alright fine then . 
  maine has one of the most gun happy cultures i 've seen , rivaling texas and yet has the same rate of homicides as oregon , a state decidedly anti-gun . 
  the south has a very pro-gun attitude , yet has a high homicide rate than west virginia , a state even more pro-gun than the south , where some of the cities are decidedly anti-gun . 
  not only that , but west virginia is even poorer than many areas of the south and yet still has a lower homicide rate . 
  meanwhile you have vermont and new hampshire with the lowest homicide rates in the country , and yet when you compare it to another state which is very similar to both of these places : deleware , there is a huge difference in homicide rate . 
  but no , you 're right : it 's all gun access . 
  the scaling for this chart is really really bad . 
  first one is < 1 , then its 1-1 .5 , then 1.5-2 .5 ( ? 
  ) , next is 2.50-7 ( ???!?!?!?!?!?!!!? ) . 
  it looks like it did its best to ensure most of the us was painted one color and only show the outliers . 
  buuuuutttt then again , we have evidence that contradicts those claims as well . 
  such as the homicide rates of texas compared to california or washington . 
  * shrug * we do n't really know either . 
  what 's interesting is : you see texas and washington state ? 
  they have the same-ish homicide rates , similar distribution of populations and wealth , and yet a completely different take on guns and gun laws . 
  look at california , one of the harshest states on gun ownership and it too is right along with texas . 
  so obviously gun ownership is n't the only factor , and it might not even be a factor with any influence whatsoever . 
  but at the same time , we do n't know what could cause it to be so uniform across all the states . 
  we think gun culture has an effect , but we do n't have any evidence to support it . 
  we think wealth has an effect , but we only have a little bit of evidence to support that . 
  so maybe wealth disparity ? 
  so many questions , not enough time , money , or interest to answer them . 
  well ... there is canada . 
  the map is great and all , and i do actually get some kind of perverse enjoyment from shitting on my own country , but damn that note is perhaps the most intriguing thing about this !, 
  the story behind that note must be an interesting one . 
  i 'm almost certain that 's illegal . 
  just would like to mention : when calling ** u ** sers use / u / not / r / , which is for sub ** r ** eddits . 
  i would like to mention china is doing really well as of late ... 
  its not squatting !, 
  its tactical redeployment !, 
  did you learn nothing !, 
  jesus , what outside forces would 've tanked the sterling that hard ? 
  constantinople will always be greek . 
  you stole it . 
  plus , your capital is ankara , which is outside of europe . 
  you 're nation is in a unique position . 
  and calling it european is an insult to most of the country and its history . 
  yeah , but lets be real here : nato combined would not be able to take on the us at the current time , so most likely many of those nato members would fight with the us or try to remain neutral . 
  of course , if things have gotten to the point where the us is invading its closest allies ... 
  i think we have other problems . 
  yeah , cause most smaller nations want to piss off a security council member . 
  here 's an important part about the way the un is designed : any single member of the security council is immune from all legal action the un may take against it ... because they have the power to veto any punishments that may be issued . 
  since when has the security council given a damn about international law ? 
  we even have a law that allows us to invade the netherlands should any american get tried in the hague . 
  the flair , the thing that you used to tell me to fuck off in the first place ? 
  you see the kind of people that are voting in these elections ? 
  the number one group of voters who do n't vote are the young , and the moderates , something this country desperately needs . 
  ah yes , i love it when a non-european says an american ca n't live in europe . 
  where do you think the us military presence against russia is based ? 
  you have to register at a permanent address , specifically to prevent things like that . 
  of course , we could circumvent all that by doing a popular vote instead of making a vote in wyoming worth 4 times as much as a californians , but i digress . 
  i 'm talking about how the majority of turkish immigrants moved to germany for work , but there were racial tensions as far back as 2002 , and most likely those tensions have gotten worse . 
  because of the tri-level government we have here , you do n't register where you live with the government except in a census every 10 years , and in registering to vote as far as the federal government is concerned . 
  because people can move about the country freely , but the electoral college is state based while run by the federal government , the federal government needs to know where you live at the time of the election , thus registration . 
  i too prefer someone who 's running mate literally addressed a group of supporters with `` hail america '' while the crowd saluted , unironically . 
  we are monitoring asia quite closely at the current time . 
  trust us , our plan is gon na be yuge . 
  that 's not what euro skeptic means . 
  germany iirc , but germany was having problems with turks back when i lived there in 2002 , i can only imagine its gotten worse since then . 
  nato needs turkey , not the eu . 
  bit of a difference as one currently is primarily an economic alliance ( the eu , which turkey would n't contribute that much too ) , and the other a military alliance ( nato , and the us wo n't take losing the black sea very well ... we just voted in an unpredictable leader , so it may not be worth the risk ) . 
  there 's a few issues with that plan there . 
  the us likes having access to the black sea , like a lot . 
  and we kinda just voted in a guy who is immensely unpredictable . 
  russia hates you guys almost as much as greece does ( and remember : some of their maps replace you with open sea ) . 
  we did n't act against you after the fall of the soviet union , we were always against the right turn you guys took , but the extreme left was more important at the time , enemy of enemy and all that . 
  its foolish to think someone is doing something with someone else in mind . 
  the eu 's primary goal is to look out for the eu , not those trying to join it . 
  i 'm salivating over here ... 
  the point of talks is to monitor countries that are close to being eligible , which turkey recently have proven they are no where near . 
  the west has been very good at embarrassing itself recently . 
  do n't tempt us . 
  tell me again about your big fuck off sword ... 
  if anything , this makes me worry more . 
  if you live your life by dictionary definitions than you are missing the largest part of language : feeling . 
  axis means more than just `` alliance between germany , italy , japan , and other minors '' . 
  by saying you are believing a new axis power that is equivalent to saying you are a racist , it is equivalent to being anti-semitic , and a totalitarian fascist , and an imperialist . 
  that is what the axis means , not nationalism as you seem to think . 
  kinda jumping to conclusions there are n't you ? 
  he never called you racist .
