  reading [ empires and barbarians : the fall of rome and the birth of europe ] ( http://www.amazon.com/empires-barbarians-fall-birth-europe/dp/0199892261 ) at the moment . 
  pre-1960 consensus was that emigration and immigration was the end-all/be-all for the creation of european identities ( celts , germanic , etc tribes moving about ) post-1960 consensus is that migration was embellished and that technological , cultural , and political developments are more core catalysts for the identity . 
  not too far in ( i 've just got to chapter 3 ) , but he takes the middle ground . 
  the effects of emigration is not the same as immigration [ paul collier , professor of economics and public policy in the blavatnik school of government at the university of oxford on emigration ] ( https://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/how-does-emigration-affect-countries-of-origin-paul-collier-kicks-off-a-debate-on-migration/ ) [ as for immigration , guess the english crown sending colonists to ireland did n't effect the isle much / s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plantations_of_ireland ),

  you 're absolutely right , as an american i have no idea ( have been to ireland/uk/france tho ) . 
  of course i was implying all french are the same ... in the us , there 's a shit fit when starbucks changes their coffee cups . 
  if a media outlet 's cover made humor out of a nation tragedy ( blacklivematter deaths , school shootings , terrorist attacks ) there would be scathing remarks . 
  again , dark humor has a purpose and liberty is the foundation of western values , but tragedies do n't need to be tomorrow 's punchlines ( if jean reno , sarkozy , or hollande died tomorrow i bet there would be jokes for weeks ) . 
  ultimately , for me , this might be just a culture-clash . 
  the usa might be the land of free speech but france masters the idea ` rien est sacr\u00e9 ' . 
  i hate solidarity too . 
  just like when everyone did rainbows for gay marriage / s, 
  1 . it makes light of a tragic situation that really is n't a joke ... 
  i laugh at dark humor occasionally , i think it 's important because without some amount of apathetic nihilism we become uptight ninnies . 
  i believe in the western value of free speech and expression but that does n't mean i judge every speech or expression as worthy of being said or done . 
  2 . zoudoudou , i know you do n't know me but `` i get '' what the cartoon 's about ( calling people idiots over the internet is the classic retort but realize argument does n't work that way ... at least it should n't ) . 
  i didnt say it was a basic `` haha , people are dead '' joke and i know coco 's story as well . 
  the joke 's not over my head , and neither is the context . 
  tl ; dr calling someone incredibly stupid , saying `` think a little '' , or `` you just do n't get it '' is patronizing and does n't add to discussion . 
  if the core argument of this is `` we 're trying to make fun of the situation '' it is i that has overestimated the sensibilities of the french . 
  self deprecating humor is one thing but i still ca n't enjoy hebdo . 
  i ca n't laugh at innocent deaths .

  it 's horrible that rightist reactionaries are doing such , but anyone with a brain knows this always happens .

  i disagree with you on the premise . 
  i think what you call punishment is the bastardization of `` justice '' , when what was `` taken '' must be `` given '' . 
  justice should not be based on deterrence , but on what is equal . 
  for those on the left , a taxpayer-billed time-out is the complement to murder ( 1st degree ) .

  during university i greatly admired europe .
