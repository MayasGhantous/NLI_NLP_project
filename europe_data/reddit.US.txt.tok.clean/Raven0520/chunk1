by declaring us the aggressors unjustly , with unintended consequences , the victors prepared a fertile ground on which something really dark grew .

  * harbor, 
  wikipedia says 77 people died . 
  i remember watching * band of brothers * as a kid and the episodes set in berchtesgaden looked like something out of a fairy tale . 
  i would love to visit there . 
  germans are notoriously shit at maintaining beach heads as well !, 
  unlike some americans , i really do n't care what a bunch of guys who have been dead for almost 200 years would have to say about current events . 
  especially considering some of them were slave owners . 
  but more importantly , if we 're alone on this mountain , whose balls are we sucking ? 
  do we really have a rival since the soviet union collapsed ? 
  we 're just sitting alone up here on mount superpower . 
  the obvious answer would be china but we 're sorta tied at the hip . 
  damn it 's lonely up here . 
  finally norway does n't win something .

   he , as every american , bears responsibility for his own country 's policies but redditors are always telling me that america is n't a real democracy , it 's a fascist oligarchic police state .

  i should mention that the equation has a few constants . 
  the russian constant ( represented by the symbol \u262d ) adds 1x10 ^ 10 to the denominator , resulting in russian democracy being an infinitely small positive number . 
  the non-aligned constant applies to all non-eu or non-nato counties , in which the amount of imperialism they are subjected to on a scale of japan to the democratic republic of congo adds a positive number to the denominator . 
  the north korean constant adds negative infinity to the denominator . 
  thus north korea has negative democracy . 
  democracy = ( oil reserves x attractive women ) / eu representatives . 
  norway is not in the eu , so they get divided by 0 resulting in their freedom being so free it is undefined .

  can someone explain how these porn bans actually happen ? 
  the article says a law was `` quietly amended . '', 
  like , do a bunch of conservative mps sit around and think of sex acts to ban in porn ? 
  do they really have nothing better to do ? 
  `` this city just glows , '' said a recent foreign diplomat upon visiting europe 's new capital . 
  he continued , `` it radiates life and prosperity , even the nearby river is full of oddly large fish . '',

  actually savannahjeff is our top operative , he get 's paid in stolen nazi gold , the bottled tears of palestinian children , and iraqi crude oil .

  of the six men , three were kia , one died from exposure after descending into alcoholism brought on by his unwanted fame , and the other two went the rest of their lives avoiding the media and not discussing it , even with their families . 
   the soviet defeat in afghanistan was the result of a cia intervention . 
  how does this change the fact that the soviet union fought a brutal war there with little to no regard for collateral damage ? 
  they made the vietnam war look humanitarian by comparison . 
  america supports brown people fighting against an authoritarian regime and we 're the baddies now ? 
  do you really think that if the soviets had won , afghanistan would be a better place ? 
  what would have happened to when the soviet union collapsed ? 
   and isolating assad was n't done by putin .
