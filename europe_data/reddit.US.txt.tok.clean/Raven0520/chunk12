  so i googled , `` angela merkel on vacation '' to see where , or if , she goes on vacation . 
  turns out she goes on an [ annual trip to italy ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/merkel-shows-austerity-and-humanity-on-vacations-in-italy-a-926696.html ) , and the article says ,  according to alessandro mattera , a chef at a local restaurant , merkel often asks him to pass on recipes to her . 
  in return , the chancellor once asked mattera to visit her in berlin , a trip he remembers fondly . 
  `` i remember her banter well , '' he told the magazine . 
  what a legend . 
  in times of great stress the german republic can appoint a leader who is not subject to cons ... wait , no , no they do n't do that anymore , never mind . 
   when in drag she is a woman is n't that offensive to trans people , though ? 
  it implies all it takes to be a man or woman is clothes/wigs , etc. 
  meanwhile trans people have to have life changing surgery , do hormone therapy , etc. 
  they ca n't stop being trans when they do n't feel like it , they have a mental condition , not a lifestyle preference .

  he 's not trans , he 's a drag queen . 
  why is it considered tolerant and progressive to have him on tv ? 
  it 's literally a sexual fetish , what does it have to do with the rights of actual transgender people ( or gay people , seeing as most of them are n't drag queens , obviously ) to have a dude who just likes to dress up as a woman on tv ? 
  how is that any different from inviting a guy with a raging foot fetish to host eurovision , and having him tickle the feet of every contestant ? 
  or a furry ? 
  if i had said `` semi '' or `` tractor trailer , '' every brit here would feel the need to correct me , `` you mean a lorry ? '', 
  i went the safe route . 
  jokes on them , it 's not called * eurolorry simulator * , is it ? 
  nope . 
  same . 
  trigger warning !, 
  preferably not in a lorry , if you want to be safe . 
  is there a memorial to those fallen heroes in wales ? 
  i feel there should be , remember the 300 !,

  your country is the biggest tax haven for american corporations in the world , so if you do n't want to further our corporate interests , your government should probably start making them pay taxes ... 
  i think many people are aware of how awful german corporations are , like siemens . 
  they 're currently being sued by the chinese government for allegedly rigging their healthcare system to use disposable siemens products . 
  imagine if that was an american corporation and a european country , this sub would go ballistic .
