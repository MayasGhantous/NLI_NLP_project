  `` at work . '', 
  reminds me of how the woman who made that `` 10 hours of walking in nyc as a woman '' video was accused of being racist because almost everyone in the video who harassed her was a minority . 
  ca n't hear you over the roar of all these deep fryers i 'm using to make freedom fries . 
  i bet you wish you had some , latvia . 
  / r/swissproblems has nothing on / r/justnorwayproblems . 
  it 's from [ this place .

  never took you for an eu federalist . 
  they 've already got communists in power so it seems we 've skipped ahead a few chapters . 
  no one cares about you , ivory coast . 
  but you 're saying this as someone from a country that is , as you said , `` shitty , corrupt . '', 
  why would someone from a country that is n't shitty and corrupt want to give up their sovereignty just so they can `` fix '' southern and eastern europe ? 
  you ca n't really equate the rapes committed by american , british , and french militaries to those by the red army . 
  does n't make them any less horrible , but the sheer amount of the rapes committed by the soviets was unprecedented among the allies . 
  you 're talking about thousands ( for the western allies ) to ( an estimated ) ~ 2 million by the soviets . 
  rape happens wherever armies go , but the eastern front was appalling . 
  it was a war of extermination by the germans and of revenge by the soviets . 
  it 's one reason why eastern europeans get offended by the russians still calling it `` the great patriotic war , '' and referring to themselves as liberators . 
  and fauna refers to all animal life forms . 
  what did you learn about why it ( the second one ) started ? 
  do i really have to explain why referring to a human as a vile creature is dehumanizing ? 
  the aborigines in australia were once classified as `` native fauna , '' do you see what 's wrong with that ? 
  just call them vile * people * . 
  shut it down !, 
  that kind of thinking lead to millions of german and eastern european women getting raped by the soviets . 
  eye for an eye makes the whole world blind etc. 
  you can negate the effect by eating a [ kosher hot dog .

   absolutely disgusting , vile ** creatures . 
  ** you 're humanizing them the same way they dehumanized their victims m8 . 
  totally werf . 
  i just do n't get why she would care , waving a flag is n't ultra-nationalism . 
  just out of curiosity , what did you learn about south africa ? 
   i could do without having to do a social translation too . 
  dclauzel is going to start putting little action cues in his translations like in the script for a play . 
  dclauzel ( french ) : blah blah blah french hon hon hon dclauzel ( english ) : yes i totally agree , my german friend . 
  * dclauzel smiles and sips his wine , thinking about what a fool this german is , and how completely wrong he is . 
  then dclauzel puffs his cigarette and watches as the smoke leaves through the window , into this warm parisian night . 
  you have to admire just how much he seems to genuinely love being french . 
  so what do the pakistanis have in their cum that makes it so valuable to your people ? 
  the fuck ? 
  that chart gets posted here every time someone mentions wwii , and all i think it proves is that french people consume much more american media than russian . 
  is it our fault that french people do n't watch soviet/russian films about wwii ? 
  better stock up on [ this . 
  the problem with balkan drama is that the market is over-saturated , the shit is * everywhere * . 
  i prefer irish-british drama , because you rarely see it here , but when it pops up , it 's steaming hot and covered in salty butter . 
  i once saw an irishman ( whose username was a reference to bobby sands ) wander into / r/ukpolitics , it was pretty great . 
  at one point he was told to , `` pick up your buddy bobby 's diet . '', 
  they have been gargling our semen for 30 years , is that what politeness is in europe ? 
  would we become the reichtangle ? 
  yeah that 's why americans get soooo offended by 9/11 jokes . 
  reddit * is * a massive leftist circlejerk . 
  uh , the nhs wo n't pay to keep you alive indefinitely . 
  after a certain point , your life simply is n't worth it to the british tax payers . 
  not saying i disagree with that , it 's just how it is . 
  so something like this could happen in a country with socialized healthcare . 
  because we only accept people who already have valuable skills , education , or money . 
  this goes straight to the top of my list of , `` things i never thought i 'd hear from europeans . '', 
  what is to ensure these refugees actually stay in poland ? 
  i do n't understand how the term `` political islam '' is n't redundant . 
  islam is inherently political , as is judaism . 
  it 's both . 
  if rotherham is any indication of how their police deal with these rape gangs , they 'd probably just shoot the victim . 
  or her father . 
  everyone thinks you 're doing this cause he 's australian , but poland is upside down too . 
  i believe that was max mosley , former president of the fia . 
  you were off by a letter . 
  because we live in the 21st century and some dude/robot in japan can make a car better and faster than some guy in birmingham . 
  because it 's cheaper to [ import coal than to mine it in the uk . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coal_mining_in_the_united_kingdom#/media/file:uk_coal_production.png ) the uk has a service economy now , like the rest of western europe . 
  even germany only gets ~ 30 % of its gdp from industry , and less than a percentage point from mining and agriculture . 
  thatcher 's privatization was change that was necessary , the way she went about doing it was horribly uncaring and sociopathic , but the change itself was inevitable . 
  if you wan na vote for a party that 's against globalization , or just reality , really , your only option is the bnp . 
   bant air . 
  that 's just filthy m8, 
  mexicans of europe !, 
   change is a certainty , so it needs to be embraced . 
    reasons and origins of the problem we face is in fact due to the nature of the politics purported by farage and his queen , thatcher . 
  is n't that a bit of a contradiction ? 
  so ukip appeals to ... working class british people ? 
  does n't sound so horrible when you put it that way , does it ? 
   yolo-theswagnificent, 
  it 's a tumblr thing .

  i once got into a discussion with someone in / r/economics who claimed borders were just arbitrary lines in a the sand . 
  i asked him why he thought that while still defending the institution of private property/absentee ownership and he did n't respond . 
  apparently we have no right to control our borders but capitalists have the right to own our means of production .

  paul is dead , killed to death in 1966 . 
  it 's by / u/yaddar . 
   greece also caused problems . 
  according to the bbc , `` its chronically weak economy meant successive greek governments responded by decreasing the amount of gold in their coins , [ 19 ] thereby debasing their currency in relation to those of other nations in the union and in violation of the original agreement '' . 
  greece was formally expelled from the latin monetary union in 1908 . 
  it was readmitted in 1910 , however . 
  do you consider northern ireland to be part of europe ? 
  no , that was the [ kingdom of great britain .
