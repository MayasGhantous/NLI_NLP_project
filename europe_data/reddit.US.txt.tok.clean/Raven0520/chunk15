  while they may not be in the majority , plenty of species are usually monogamous . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_monogamy_in_mammalian_species ) , `` only ~ 3-5 % of all mammalian species are socially monogamous , including some species that mate for life and ones that mate for an extended period of time . '',

  i also do n't think gay marriage has anything to do with whether or not being gay is a `` good '' thing .
