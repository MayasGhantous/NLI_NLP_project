  people who are pro-choice do n't think everyone should go out and get abortions , but that everyone should have the right to . 
  i 'd imagine the german government and their corporations would love that , more money to try and scare out of people for pirating stuff .

  it 's just part of their culture man , like strikes and baguettes . 
   it was a reason of admissions in the union and they decided to go with it , it was not imposed on them . 
  their desire to join the eu far outweighed their desire to keep the death penalty . 
  that does n't mean the majority of people supported abolishing it , they just did n't care . 
  there was an [ article posted here recently that found most estonians still support the death penalty . 
  ] ( http://news.err.ee/v/politics/society/e5ae5f0f-0a95-4c81-a60d-80a820edf2a1 ), 
   a bill was passed by a federal court if i recall well , but if texas had their way they 'd legalise it in 100 years . 
  the comparison is not adequate in my opinion . 
  i guess that means yuropeans ca n't brag about abolishing the death penalty . 
  he just wanted his day in the sun , that 's all . 
  they mad cuz we legalized homogay marriage , is totally haram . 
  [ or can they ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_swedes ), 
  they actually did claim that , the cape colony ( british south africa ) had restrictions on who could vote , but there was no actual color barrier . 
  in the boer states blacks had no political rights , or rights at all to be frank , so the british claimed they were going to give political rights to both the uitlanders and blacks . 
  the africans were then dismayed when , after the war ended , the british allowed the transvaal and oranje river colonies to decide themselves if blacks could vote . 
  obviously , they voted no . 
  it sewed the seeds for apartheid , and the rest is history . 
  one of the reasons the [ british landed at gallipoli was to secure oil interests in the region . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1a0j6y/what_was_so_important_about_the_capture_of_turkey/c8szrri ) the brits are like the * seinfeld * of war , they invented things that have become cliche . 
  serbian women  swedish women !, 
  their persecution complex aka wilhelm did nothing wrong and wwi was totally justified . 
  they were rescuing the oppressed british minority , the uitlanders . 
  not even kidding , that 's how they sold the war to the british public . 
   i 'm from brasov , i love the city , but this video is gay as fuck . 
  because governments are inherently morally superior to the private sector , especially the us government . 
  i always hear europeans saying wonderful things about it . 
  yes , [ but are they chocolate on the inside ? 
  but they were also the largest ethnic group in the soviet union . 
  yes , stalin was such a georgian nationalist that he proceeded to russify minorities in the soviet union . 
  i take it you did n't read the article , he said that by not helping these people , europe would lose its identity of `` peace and civilization . '', 
  what does india have to do with contemporary britain and the `` special relationship ? '', 
  that depends on how you define a movie 's nationality , it was distributed by an american film company .

  i only asked because i [ saw someone ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33h5dy/council_of_europe_mass_surveillance_does_not/cqlb9po ) who had their state flag as flair . 
  i guess he got that a long time ago because the mods did n't even remember giving it to him . 
  i 'm beginning to wonder if there is n't something happening in europe that can be explained with a banana . 
  yes , [ they even built a castle here . 
  ] ( http://darkroom.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/00487101_h14003899.jpg ) not really . 
  apparently the cross sections of the flag was the coat of arms of the mother of lord baltimore , it became popular with confederate sympathizers during the civil war and thus in order to help reunify the state afterwards they added it to the original flag , which was just the bavaria-esque orange and black pattern , the coat of arms of lord baltimore himself . 
  maryland , aka the only state flag that does n't suck . 
  it 's / r/vexillologycirclejerk approved !, 
  i tried getting my state flag as my flair and the mods said no , it would `` confuse people '' to have federal districts outside of europe as flairs . 
  it 's not our fault the british people themselves do n't remember the burma campaign . 
  if we brought attention to the british campaign in southwest asia , some more people might find out about [ this .

  you ca n't really say we downplay the british in wwii when we 've constructed this bullshit narrative of the british as the plucky underdogs standing up to the big bad germans . 
  the * battle of britain * movie staring robert shaw and michael caine is full of propaganda , portraying the battle as a struggle for survival that stopped a german invasion . 
  in reality , [ the british had more planes , more pilots , were building more planes , were training more pilots , had radar , and had the geographic advantage . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2pompb/fact_or_fiction_hitler_almost_destroyed_raf_by/cmyl10e ) if they had lost the battle of britain it would have been pretty embarrassing . 
  and even so , the germans would n't have been able to invade the island for years , they had no capacity for amphibious landings . 
  the british were not the underdogs in wwii , they had the largest empire the world has ever seen at their disposal . 
  hollywood also just made a film about bletchley park that made the baseless claim that the work there [ cut the war short by 2 years and saved 14 million lives . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/2pq5fa/the_imitation_game_ends_with_the_quote_historians/cmz3q4l ) this is n't meant to downplay the battle of britain or bletchley park , the former effectively neutered the luftwaffe and obviously cracking the enigma code was a huge deal , but the popular narrative of britain in wwii is n't very accurate . 
  in regards to the burma campaign specifically , [ this is what an askhistorians mod and flaired user had to say . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/31kbsm/how_much_did_the_british_contribute_to_victory_in/cq2cw2m )  as much as it hurts me to say it , the war in burma was not important at all in the defeat of the japanese . 
  the war against the japanese was decisively fought by the americans . 
  the japanese were unable to supply and send reinforcements to burma by 1944 due to the control that the americans had over the sea and air by then . 
  on top of that , reinforcements were clearly more important to far more vital locations closer to japan . 
  burma did tie up a sizeable amount of japanese troops that could have been used elsewhere however , and operation u-go inflicted the largest defeat that the japanese suffered on the ground . 
  in the end , burma meant very little in comparison to far greater and decisive battles in the pacific , but it did mean a great deal to make up for the humiliation that the british suffered in 1941-42 . 
   however , i hope this will not stop anyone from studying his incredibly interesting aspect of wwii . 
  general william slim , general of the british 14th army , is in my opinion the best british general of the war ( i 've written about him here previously ) and operation extended capital in 1945 is one of the finest executed operations during wwii . 
  is he really wrong , though ? 
  the far left fights globalization in the form of being anti-free trade , and think of themselves as `` fighting imperialism , '' `` neoliberalism , '' and `` western cultural hegemony . '', 
  fascists ( if you wan na call them far right ) oppose globalization and liberalism because they claim it destroys their cultures ( `` americanization of europe '' ) as well , and they oppose immigration for the same reason . 
  autarky has been a policy of both communist and fascist regimes . 
  ukip probably just opposes it because they hate everything the eu has ever done , ever . 
  same with the paultards in america , they think nafta `` is n't real free trade '' because statism or something . 
  jeff is building an army . 
  we shall march across europe burning the last vestiges of protectionism and autarky , leaving behind a trail of burnt kippers and greenys . 
  it will be remembered for time immortal , `` where were you when the tariffs collapsed ? '', 
  now we just need a flag ... 
  when i first clicked on this thread the top comment was `` ttip is trying to make american law universal . '', 
  so that means ttip = legalized abortions in ireland and poland .
