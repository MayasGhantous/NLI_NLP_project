  i always read it in victor reznov 's voice from cod . 
  `` swagovic , kravchenko , steiner , all must die ! '', 
  then the anti-ttip crowd would call him a pedophile/shill for the vatican . 
  i would n't blame him if he just gave up at this point . 
  there was this country called the soviet union , you may have heard of it . 
  we had this `` war '' ... 
  odd , i keep hearing that we 're all cultural marxists pushing our gender ideology and political correctness on europe . 
  sweden was n't actually sleeping , he 'd never miss a chance to watch that . 
  they are n't tourists if they never leave . 
  you ca n't look at something that does n't exist . 
  is n't brighton the gayest city in britain ? 
  i guess we now know why , when the french burned the place they must have left the houses of their own kind untouched . 
  sealand can into relevance !, 
  i wonder what casus belli this event would give them , `` restore order '' maybe ? 
  or `` install friendly regime . '', 
  what part of my comment implies otherwise ... ? 
  waiting for that irish newspaper to run a story , `` can you choose your favorite swedish bombing ? '', 
  guess you better yank us outta here , than . 
  it 's the mail 's wet dream .

  first they came for the waffles ... 
  they probably wont get your sarcasm . 
  they are rejoicing like england is the promise land , when they left behind a far larger welfare state in france . 
  i do n't get it . 
  north korea was also better off ( economically ) than the south for the first few decades of their existence . 
  then freedom ^ tm kicked in and south korea blazed ahead , leaving best korea in the dust . 
   childish good looks no wonder the english spent so much time fucking you . 
  that was a terrible joke , and i am sorry . 
  [ the estonian menace must be contained !, 
  sick banter m8s, 
  i feel like this is only part of the solution , in the end with more welfare you 're giving people less reasons to * not * have children , you are n't giving them any reasons * to * have children . 
  it 's his patriotic duty . 
  moment of silence for the fallen danish empire . 
  you have a swedish minority , start oppressing them and sweden will annex you . 
  it 's flawless logic . 
  just do n't confuse them with your russians , or things will go very wrong . 
  it 's how we ( america ) plan on sapping your precious bodily fluids . 
  * loyal * british subjects , too . 
  better off together , 
  i think australia takes the cake in that regard .

  they think we 're cooler than you !, 
  u 8 the b8 m8, 
  why is he yelling in english ... 
  you 're using the tankie definition of socialism , which is basically `` the phase before stateless communism . '', 
  they ( specifically lenin in * the state and revolution * ) started referring to socialism as a transitional phase between capitalism and communism during which the state , property laws , and other `` remnants of bourgeoisie society '' would still remain . 
  because they needed justifications for their massive , oppressive state . 
   i also would n't describe anarchists as socialists . 
  some of them sort of are socialists , but you also get anarcho-capitalists , which is n't really socialism . 
  anarcho-capitalists are not anarchists , they are libertarians . 
  i 'm guessing you 're a democratic socialist ? 
  socialism is just a vague term that can be applied to anyone who is anti-capitalist , besides fascists . 
  anarchists and communists are all socialists . 
  what is the difference between the socialist party and the communist party ... ? 
  i 'm guessing the communists are stalinists ? 
  do n't click that link unless you wan na be put on an nsa watch-list . 
  i think the parliament would end up being half communist and half ukip . 
  it seems people on the political fringe prefer larping on the internet to real life activism . 
  who gets to play nigel farage ? 
  take that , mattress girl !, 
   but if the us & eu appears you ca n't read m8 , why are you so mad ? 
  sounds like he better check his privilege . 
   saddam was a militarist who had controlled more than only 10 % of his people unlike bashar . 
  even though he filled his government with sunnis in a country where they make up 1/5th of the population ? 
   if america would n't have intervened , we definitely would n't have had the insurgency we have right now . 
  neither in iraq , nor in syria . 
  so you think america caused the arab spring ? 
  he took a plane , not a boat !, 
  if al-assad could n't do it , what makes you think saddam could ? 
  if you want them in your country , be my guest . 
  the group that became isis was founded in 1999 by a jordanian islamist . 
  so yeah , `` isis '' would not exist , but what does that have to do with the civil war in syria ? 
  so instead of isis we 'd have iss , same shit different day . 
  it 's more the australian way to be honest . 
  so he should have just said syrians in the first place , not `` people . '', 
  too bad the ottoman 's sided with germany and austria in the first world war . 
  so the group is founded in 1999 , takes advantage of the chaos of iraq , gets rekt by us and iraqi forces , and then sneaks across the border and takes advantage of the vacuum in syria . 
  after the us troop withdraw the iraqis run away from isis in their underwear and they gain back ground they had lost years ago in iraq . 
  still failing to see how we created isis . 
  why would saddam hussein have sent the iraqi military to clean up the situation in syria right now ? 
  what makes you think saddam himself would have survived the arab spring ? 
  til america started the syrian civil war . 
  and on the other hand i 've had turkish apologists tell me that arabs were better off living under the ottomans and that those dastardly brits tricked them into revolting with nonsense about self determination ( the horror ) . 
   somalia , which has been under a civil war for decades maybe they should n't have [ dragged the bodies of our soldiers through the streets like hunting prizes ] ( https://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/u-s-marine-dragged-through-mogadishu/ ) ( nsfl ) when we tried to arrest their favorite war lord , who had been using starvation as a weapon against rival clans , resulting in the deaths hundreds of thousands of somalis . 
  then they should be processed and granted asylum . 
  but he did n't say `` syrians flee to europe '' he said `` people '' which could be anyone . 
  `` jet fuel ca n't melt steel beams . '',
