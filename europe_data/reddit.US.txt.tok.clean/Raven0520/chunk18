  probably because those people are n't syrians fleeing isis but economic migrants trying to get to northern europe . 
  bit of a difference there m8 . 
  the eu consists of countries who do n't even use the same currency . 
  seems like it would make much more sense to compare the us to the eurozone . 
  and you 'll have to be seen in a nissan leaf .

  even moldova gets one , but not belarus . 
  [ they 've always been special . 
  yep , no difference between joining isis and buying into one of those `` make money fast and easy ! '', 
  scams . 
  just last week one of those dickheads knocked on my door and asked me to try a sample of the latest and greatest diet bar , when i declined he chopped my left hand off with a dull scimitar . 
  he claimed that by declining , i had insulted the profit .

  a muslim friend of mine told me israel is run by the jews . 
  well his former position was prime minister of legendbourg . 
   the europeans were just too autistic this made my day , thank you .

   not having the police killing somebody on a daily basis . 
  instead they sit idle while pakistanis and sleazy old white politicians/celebrities rape your children .

   so you think today , in the 21st century , in 2015 , europe would kill each other as soon as the us would leave or stop intervening ? 
  that 's exactly what eu federalists have told me on this subreddit . 
  pretty hilarious that you say `` rest of the world '' like you 've got some solidarity with africans and asians against the great imperialist satan usa .

   its funny how you 're turning this into an `` eewww '' issue , in europe we do n't wash eggs after they come out of the chickens arse so the membrane that keeps them airtight and fresh remains intact . 
  did you read the comment i was replying to ... ? 
  the user claimed american milk was `` full of puss . '', 
  he 's clearly implying that our milk is gross . 
  [ those labels are a joke . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/california_proposition_65_%281986%29#warning_label )  the following warning language is standard on products sold in california if they contain chemicals on the proposition 65 list and the amount of exposure caused by the product is not within defined safety limits . 
    warning : this product contains chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm . 
   the wording can be changed as necessary , so long as it communicates that the chemical in question is known to the state to cause cancer , or birth defects or other reproductive harm . 
  for exposures from other sources , such as car exhaust in a parking garage , a standard sign might read : `` this area contains chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer , or birth defects or other reproductive harm '' . 
  [ 15 ]  some businesses in the state post similar notices on their premises , even when they have not evaluated the actual level of risk from a listed chemical they know is present . 
  [ 16 ] warning signs are often posted at gas stations , [ 17 ] hardware suppliers , [ 18 ] grocery stores , drug stores , medical facilities , and many other businesses . 
  [ 19 ] [ 20 ] government agencies , [ 21 ] parking garages , hotels , [ 20 ] apartment complexes , [ 22 ] retail stores , [ 23 ] banks , and restaurants [ 24 ] also post warning signs because of the possibility of hazardous chemicals being present in everyday items or the nearby environment . 
  some large businesses , such as utility companies , mail a prop 65 notice to all customers each year to warn them of dangerous substances like natural gas [ 25 ] or the sand used in sandblasting .
