  [ 26 ]  there is no penalty for posting an unnecessary warning sign . 
  [ 27 ] because of the overuse of the vague warning , the ubiquitous signs ultimately communicate very little information to the end user . 
  [ 17 ] [ 28 ] this problem has been recognized by california courts , [ 29 ] [ 30 ] advocates , [ 17 ] [ 31 ] and businesses . 
  [ 20 ] have you ever heard the rumor that diet coke gives you cancer ? 
  that 's because in the 90s california required food with aspartame in it to be labeled as containing a carcinogen . 
  turns out , upon much research by the fda , it does n't . 
  the plumber you sent out to fix my toilet was complete shit , i could n't even pronounce his name . 
  he kept asking about our space program , it was so weird . 
  she certainly cooks better than you . 
   take mcdonalds food for instance . 
  in the us in some states , they 're required to have a sticker in the window saying that the ` food ' served there has been declared unfit for human consumption . 
  [ citation needed ] i tried google and just found articles about some tv show host who `` exposed '' the fact that mcdonald 's used ammonia to kill bacteria in their meat , which they stopped doing in 2012 . 
   food extremely high in trans-fat-acids for instance , is not sellable in the eu . 
  uh , [ according to wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trans_fat#public_response_and_regulation ) there does n't seem to be any eu laws on trans fat in food , there are just individual member states that ban/regulate it , which is the same way it is in the us . 
   it has been established that trans fats in human milk fluctuate with maternal consumption of trans fat , and that the amount of trans fats in the bloodstream of breastfed infants fluctuates with the amounts found in their milk . 
  reported percentages of trans fats ( compared to total fats ) in human milk range from 1 % in spain , 2 % in france , 4 % in germany , and 7 % in canada and the united states . 
  [ 48 ]  trans fats are used in shortenings for deep-frying in restaurants , as they can be used for longer than most conventional oils before becoming rancid . 
  in the early 21st century , non-hydrogenated vegetable oils that have lifespans exceeding that of the frying shortenings became available . 
  [ 49 ] as fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations , trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations . 
  for example , an analysis of samples of mcdonald 's french fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in new york city contained twice as much trans fat as in hungary , and 28 times as much as in denmark ( where trans fats are restricted ) . 
  at kfc , the pattern was reversed with hungary 's product containing twice the trans fat of the new york product . 
  even within the us there was variation , with fries in new york containing 30 % more trans fat than those from atlanta . 
  [ 50 ] so there 's a lot of variation within the us and the eu . 
   yes , mcdonalds exists in denmark , but the contents of the food are vastly different from mcdonalds in the us , simply because they according to local law has to meet a higher minimum standard of quality and also because they change their menu wherever they go , and it should be noted that denmark is one of only two countries in europe that has banned trans fats . 
  as i noted in [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/376uqd/eu_dropped_plans_for_safer_pesticides_because_of/crkf5jk ) , the eu allows milk to have a detectable level of drugs in it , should i oppose ttip because i do n't want drugs in muh milk ? 
   high quality international products are already allowed in the eu . 
  yeah , like russian gas . 
  pfft perfidious albion pls go, 
  the greeks have been selling off government assets , which means more opportunity for the private sector and more free trade . 
  which might not be inherently bad , but some industries that provide great public benefit are just not profitable . 
  if you ever talk to a british person about their railway system , they 'll tell you it went to shit after privatization . 
   why would n't german taxpayers want their loans to greece paid back ? 
  it seems like the question of `` will implementing austerity actually help greece get back on its feet and pay these loans '' has not been answered .

  but people should join the british armed forces , because they play a crucial role in the defense of europe . 
  and surely these muslims view amerikkka as 100x worse than the uk , and thus want the great imperialist satan out of europe . 
  if that happens and they still condemn the british military , the continent will be left woefully un-defended . 
  maybe they should apply that logic to gay people , apostasy , and jews !, 
  american corporations base themselves in europe , screwing the us out of hundreds of billions of dollars in taxable revenue , and you 're the victim ? 
  lol, 
  from a moderate muslim perspective the british armed forces is no better than fucking isis ? 
  that says far more about `` moderate muslims '' than it does the uk 's military . 
  to be fair that is the v6 model , but the w10/v10 is n't worth much either , because no one wants to pay for the maintenance .
