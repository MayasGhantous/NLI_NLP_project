  ireland , luxembourg , malta , your country , are all fine destinations for corporate bank accounts . 
  fun fact , the netherlands is actually the most popular destination for us and german multinational corporations .

   the swiss banking sector is relatively among the 4 largest in the world . 
  if only the uk had a large financial sector ...  but their stolen nazi-gold also helped with a head start in post-war europe . 
  as did portugal , where are they now ? 
  you ca n't chalk up the swiss success story to nazi gold . 
  my mother currently has a case of these in the fridge , i do n't know what that says about her . 
  wait so does this mean john oliver has to drink a budweiser ? 
  looks like a job for captain sweden !, 
  funny how when it comes to defense spending , suddenly everyone is pro austerity . 
  you do get pooped on quite a lot in / r/lithuaniaspheres . 
  [ feels  facts i guess . 
  ] ( http://puu.sh/i96v2/40968d9f0c.png ) i mean , you can play off norway because of dat oil money , but switzerland has no natural resources or coastline . 
  and contrary to popular belief , most of their gdp does not come from evil banksters ( the bankers the bonues amirite ? 
  ) , only ~ 12 % of it does . 
  i hear switzerland does ok . 
  hey man that 's not true , we do n't actually pay for their [ redacted ] and [ redacted ] . 
   germany   the big bang theory maybe everyone is right and germans are n't funny . 
  lack of punctuality is a sign of immaturity . 
  are you implying i 'm autistic ? 
  how very ableist of you . 
  if it makes you feel better to call the germans racist when they poke fun at your country , ok . 
  i tip my fedora to you sir , or was it a trilby ?

   race is about skin colour or facial features . 
  that is exactly what * race * is m8 , ethnicity \u2260 race . 
  [ i think they need some of this . 
  french people are n't a race so i do n't really know how it could be racism . 
  when people call americans fat should we cry racism ? 
  / u/jpaolo u r racist yuo r the worst racist raparations now polish death camps i should have known !, 
   the hat being worn is a jewish one and not a bowler hat [ it looks ] ( http://puu.sh/i7mo1/93e3efe4c9.jpg ) exactly like a [ bowler hat .

  i think you 're conflating nationalist stereotypes with racism . 
  oh come on , it 's pretty obvious they were n't going there . 
  he 's just supposed to look bourgeoisie . 
  it says more about how antisemitic our mental image of the greedy 19th century capitalist is than about contemporary german race relations . 
  i quoted that comment because i thought it was funny , not because i actually think they 're trying to be racist . 
  i recommend they build israel 3 new submarines , that should cover it . 
  saw this on / r/unitedkingdom and thought it would be appropriate here . 
  also , from the uk thread someone commented :  why does the british guy taking all the money playing the board game look so much like an hasidic jew ? 
  dammit germany , you just ca n't win !, 
  now i 'm curious if romanians get offended about being called balkan the same way poles do if you refer to them as eastern european . 
  [ wikipedia says no . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkans#/media/file:balkan_topo_en.jpg ), 
  romania is balkan ... ? 
  but we need fptp to keep the crazy mods out !, 
  wait a minute ... 
  i thought this was / pol /, 
  \\  taking polanball seriously, 
  this is good for bitcoin . 
  that 's not very catholic , what would jesus do ? 
   there is a ukrainian here who does that too so he writes in english and then russian ? 
   it 's useless to go back and project them as the bad guys because it ignores the historical context it 's useless to say genocide is wrong , no matter what century it happened in ? 
  there is a difference between saying , `` this happened , and it actually had some positive influences on contemporary - insert country here - '' and white washing history . 
  you can still say something is morally wrong and acknowledge the historical context in which it happened . 
   it would be genuinely insane for me to sincerely raise this as an ongoing issue in english-french relations . 
  i 'm not advocating blaming contemporary turks for something they have nothing to do with . 
  they do n't need to apologize for what the ottomans did in europe . 
  you 're putting words in his mouth though , he never said europeans did n't do that . 
  if simply stating facts ( the turks raped and looted the city ) is `` anti-turkish racism '' than you may be more russian than turkish , because that 's the same shit putinbots say . 
  his statement that it was a `` great loss for europe '' is certainly debatable , but what the occupying turks did is n't . 
   people act like only we pillaged and conquered in the history of mankind . 
  i do n't know who these people are , but i hear far more about the european colonization of much of the world than the ottomans . 
  this entire comment thread started because someone was actually defending the ottoman colonization of south eastern europe . 
  who is this thread is defending forced conversions by christians ? 
  who here is saying sub-saharan africans should be thankful that europeans enriched their culture with pretty churches ? 
  * place in european history and politics, 
  is spain an african country because of melilla and ceuta ? 
  i do n't really get your point , turkey is n't european . 
  bahar mustafa just illustrates the fact that race is a social construct because there is no coherent way to label someone white or black . 
  she 's not european , but she looks white . 
  that 's why people were calling her a hypocrite , because she clearly passes as white , and thus benefits in someway from white privilege . 
  only her name indicates she 's not european . 
  but the above comment seems to imply that because turks are n't european ( and thus not `` white '' ) their ~ ~ colonization of ~ ~ `` introduction '' into southeastern europe was benevolent and not the same as european colonization of africa , asia , and the new world , and thus worthy of celebration and praise . 
  it also pushes this `` us vs them '' ( white people vs brown people ) narrative like all europeans are guilty of colonialism and thus ca n't criticize the turks , what do estonians have to apologize for ? 
  the swiss ? 
  the irish ? 
  europeans are n't some homogenous entity of horrible oppressors . 
  i do n't think contemporary turks have to apologize for the ottomans , that was centuries ago . 
  but to defend their actions and justify them because `` muh pretty buildings '' is ridiculous . 
  i do n't think she identifies as a white person m8 , that 's kind of why she wanted to ban white people from her little circlejerks . 
  seriously , africans need to get over colonialism , the europeans built lots of pretty buildings and railroads !, 
  uh , you 're literally defending colonialism ... simply because brown people were doing it . 
  only 9 % of adults in switzerland are obese , even though they consume the most chocolate in the world . 
  what is their secret ? 
  meanwhile in greece , [ 44 % of male children are overweight . 
  ] ( http://www.oecd.org/switzerland/obesity-update-2014-switzerland.pdf#page=3 ) the fat cats are literally eating your euromonies . 
  this calls for an intervention , greek children need more austerity in their everyday lives . 
  but non-foreign born swedish women still only have a [ birth rate of 1.85 ] ( http://www.scb.se/en_/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/population/population-projections/demographic-analysis-demog/aktuell-pong/55356/behallare-for-press/380120/ ) , so do these programs really work ? 
  sheriff switzerland and officer burger are on the case !, 
  it was a play on `` boer wars , '' two conflicts in late 19th century south africa between the boers and british . 
  the first boer war happened because the british decided to formally annex the transvaal ( one of two independent boer republics , along with oranje ) , when they asked for help defeating some local african tribesman . 
  boers did n't like this and ambushed some british troops at majuba hill , the british could n't be bothered to wage a costly war so far from home so they just said fuck it have your shitty little republic ( deja vu ? ) . 
  all was well for two decades until massive gold deposits were discovered in the transvaal and the british decided the boers needed some freedom ^ tm it gave rise to the afrikaner nationalism that created apartheid south africa . 
  i like bringing them up , because it makes the limeys look bad . 
  the second boer war was brutal , the british resorted to scorched earth tactics and concentration camps to beat some dutch hillbillies . 
  even though they won , it was a massive embarrassment for the empire . 
  like vietnam , but with less commies . 
  1920 best year of my life remove bolshevik from the premises !,
