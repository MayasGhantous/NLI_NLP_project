  i 'll be honest m8 , i do n't know shite about soccer , but according to [ wikipedia  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_liga )  la liga is the strongest league in europe over the past five years according to uefa 's league coefficient , and it has been the top league in europe for more combined years than any other european league ( 16 years ) . 
  la liga clubs have won the most uefa champions league tournaments ( 14 ) and real madrid are the competitions most successful club , as a 10-time champion . 
  sevilla are the joint most successful club in the uefa europa league with 3 titles . 
  la liga is the first and only league to be represented by both finalists in a uefa champions league final on two occasions . 
  la liga based players have won the highest number of fifa world player of the year awards ( 11 ) , ballon d'or awards ( 18 ) and uefa best player in europe awards ( 3 ) . 
  la liga players also represent the highest number of fifpro world xi and uefa team of the year places .

  did you read the article , or just pull the first sentence that supposedly confirms your beliefs ? 
   somatic cell count , according to the industry 's own national mastitis council , `` reflects the levels of infection and resultant inflammation in the mammary gland of dairy cows , '' but somatic cells are not synonymous with pus cells , as has sometimes been misleadingly suggested . 
  somatic just means `` body . '' just as normal human breast milk has somatic cells -- mostly non-inflammatory white blood cells and epithelial cells sloughed off from the mammary gland ducts -- so does milk from healthy cows . 
  the problem is that many of our cows are not healthy . 
  so , somatic cells are not inherently pus forming , only when the cow has mastasis , which at the time of this report , 1/6 of dairy cows in the us were estimated to be suffering from . 
  if you actually looked at [ the source ] ( http://nmconline.org/articles/usda_scc_2010.htm ) he provides for scc in american milk you 'd find it says ,  in 2010 , during all monitored months , 89.5 % of the milk would have met a goal of 400,000 scc ( which is the current european union scc limit ) so , in conclusion , the vast majority of milk in the united states meets eu standards for scc , with an estimated average scc of between 224,000 and 272,000 , depending on how you calculate it . 
  also , as of 2012 , [ all dairy products produced in the us for eu consumption have to meet eu standards . 
  ] ( http://www.nmpf.org/latest-news/articles/eu-somatic-cell-requirements-take-effect-next-month )  i want my milk european and without pus . 
  well i 'm sorry my good man , but eu regulation allows for up to 400,000 somatic cells per ml , so it 's very possible that your glorious yuropean milk has pus in it . 
  if you want the closest thing to puss free milk , according to this [ pdf ] ( http://www.nmconline.org/articles/qualityeuro.pdf ) austria produces the best milk in the eu , with scc levels around 100,000 . 
  so us milk is comparable in quality to milk produced in the uk , germany , sweden , and other countries with scc levels around 200,000 . 
  but unlike in the us , milk in the eu is allowed to have a detectable level of drugs in it , so beware they might sap your precious bodily fluids . 
  i like how he ignores the reason we have to wait 25 years for gray imports is because mercedes spent millions of dollars lobbying congress in the 80s because americans were buying their cars in germany and just shipping them here .

  we 've taken in more iraqi refugees than any country in europe , the most being sweden , and no one is forcing them to do that . 
  also , most of the immigrants coming from libya are n't libyans , they are coming from countries in sub-saharan africa . 
  you 're also talking about * refugees * in your first sentence and * immigrants * in the second . 
  we have no moral obligation to take your immigrants , sorry .
