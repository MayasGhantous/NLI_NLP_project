  rekt, 
  would you rather fight 100 duck sized nigel farages or 1 horse sized marine le pen ? 
  those photos are representative of a small portion of those countries populations . 
  specifically , urban , progressive , middle and upper class people . 
  it 's not vodka , that we know . 
  you forgot to mention the patriots man , stop slacking . 
   welfare and diversity officer what does that even mean ? 
  muslamic rayguns have started using condoms , leaves behind less evidence . 
  well i 've got the foreigner part down . 
  i would never say such cruel things about denmark , some danish exchange students came to my high school and were very pretty . 
  i do n't care about that , where is the evidence that we tried to overthrow him ? 
  if we knew about it and did nothing , that counts as overthrowing the government ? 
  where do i sign up ? 
  dude , he broke out all the buzzwords for that . 
  well yeah , those romanians are coming to take yer jobs and welfare . 
  i doubt there are very many norwegian girls looking to get knocked up by foreigners . 
   venezuela 2002 -- democratically-elected president chavez nationalized oil industry . 
  you ca n't impregnate a sheep . 
  from oilmonies to alimonies , do n't do it man . 
  dank memes are no longer allowed in russia . 
  i think it 's the opposite , to be honest . 
  dat blue banana doe, 
  would anyone even care in france ? 
  i 've seen french people say politicians in your country are expected to have mistresses . 
  they 're like family guy in that every `` joke '' is some random cut away scenario/pun/reference / etc. 
  he 's a living reaction gif . 
  half the time he just talks in a funny accent , because that 's so original . 
  might as well start using jump cuts every 5 seconds like youtubers do . 
  relevant username ? 
   if it does n't have oil there is no oil in afghanistan . 
  we would help them because it 's in our best interest to have a friendly country on our southern border , not some rogue state who just annexed mexico . 
  [ ring a bell ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zimmermann_telegram ), 
  terrorists disclose area of future attack . 
  authorities dump a truckload of qur ` an there . 
  crisis averted ? 
  as liechtenstein and haiti learned the hard way . 
  it 's like he browsed / r/politics and wrote a standup routine . 
  it 's like if family guy was personified into a tv show host , it would be him or john stewart . 
   mind = blown , right ? 
  literally . 
  \\  invest an extra # 8bn a year for the nhs by 2020 but ... but the tories gon na take muh nhs away !, 
  seriously , where does all this `` tories will destroy the nhs ! '', 
  rhetoric come from ? 
  the day after the election there was ( to no ones surprise ) a highly upvoted post on / r/unitedkingdom , `` are n't you guys worried about the nhs now ?! '', 
  and in the comments someone who worked for the nhs , and posted a picture of their uniform as proof , said it 's all bullshit scaremongering and that privatization started under blair 's labour party . 
  another thing i do n't get is that it seems british leftists automatically assume privatized healthcare = us system . 
  completely ignoring the perfectly functioning universal healthcare systems of countries like germany , switzerland , singapore , etc. 
  i have never seen anyone from germany or switzerland here talk about reforming their healthcare systems , never seen one complain about it . 
  yet there seems to be constant talk about reforming the nhs , with the two dominant opinions being either , `` the nhs is perfect and if you touch it you are a neoliberal fascist fat cat capitalist , '' or `` the nhs is on its last leg and needs to be taken out back and shot . '', 
  surely the truth is somewhere in the middle ... 
  now it 's / r/expectedjihad . 
  seems like half the posts on / r/villageporn are from austria and switzerland . 
  [ believe it or not , the british could n't destroy this after 25 hours of bombardment . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cvsuuhn.jpg ) instead they just marched on the white house because it 's hard to miss with a torch . 
  noooooooooo !, 
  being bad at geography is just part of our culture , sweden needs to be more tolerant of other geographical belief systems . 
  it 's not like one is better than another , everything is relative . 
  in a popular vacation town in my state there is a restaurant called * adolf 's * , i 've never gone in but i hear the food causes gas . 
  these were in the uk ? 
  too many wannabe-frogs . 
  according to this subreddit we already control the uk , it would be redundant . 
  there is no greater american dream because we are already the greatest . 
  a black man defends himself from racist piece of white trash with a legally obtained and carried firearm , and this is a bad thing ? 
  lol, 
  we are on the war path now , it 's too late to turn back , this will be the defining conflict of our time . 
  because they 're nets ? 
  i think a warship is slightly more crucial to russia 's military capabilities than some camouflaged nets . 
  ireland ? 
  why does switzerland cause so much butthurt here ? 
  i want to say it 's because they 're not in the eu , but neither is norway , and they 're even richer . 
  but i 've never seen anyone here insult norway . 
  no , they did n't . 
  wmds fired !, 
  i 'll be the first american to head the labour party since tony blair !, 
  [ scotland can not into empire though . 
  according to the 2009 census , [ only 1.1 million americans speak german ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_united_states#census_statistics ) so yeah , it 's more a reflection of how dominant english is than our linguistic diversity . 
  [ you could visit the dakotas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_united_states#/media/file:second_most_prevalent_languages_in_the_us.svg ) , there are like a dozen people who live in both states , so i guess 2 of them speak german . 
  would that really turn out so bad for the uk ? 
  the french , in an effort to show how superior their way of life is , would expand your welfare state , improve workers ' rights , get rid of all the multicultural rhetoric , build nuclear power plants , and basically undo everything thatcher and new labour did to the uk . 
  you seem like the clear winners here . 
  even a spaniard ? 
  scotland and england . 
  wait a second ... 
  \\  eh , not really . 
  most suppliers sold to both sides . 
  scummy , too , but not the same . 
  so european countries sell uranium , small arms , and chemical weapon supplies to iraq , but it 's somehow not as bad as us support for the regime . 
  do swiss germans really get offended when germans try and speak regular german to them ? 
  i 've heard people say that here . 
  maybe for hispanic immigrants from central and south america , but you wo n't find many european-americans who speak their native language . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saddam_hussein#iran.e2.80.93iraq_war `` with the support of the arab states , the united states , and europe , and heavily financed by the arab states of the persian gulf , saddam hussein had become `` the defender of the arab world '' against a revolutionary iran . 
  the only exception was the soviet union , who initially refused to supply iraq on the basis of neutrality in the conflict , although in his memoirs , mikhail gorbachev claimed that leonid brezhnev refused to aid saddam over infuriation of saddam 's treatment of iraqi communists . 
  consequently , many viewed iraq as `` an agent of the civilized world '' . 
  [ 53 ] the blatant disregard of international law and violations of international borders were ignored . 
  instead iraq received economic and military support from its allies , who conveniently overlooked saddam 's use of chemical warfare against the kurds and the iranians and iraq 's efforts to develop nuclear weapons . 
  [ 53 ] '' `` during the war , iraq used chemical weapons against iranian forces fighting on the southern front and kurdish separatists who were attempting to open up a northern front in iraq with the help of iran . 
  these chemical weapons were developed by iraq from materials and technology supplied primarily by west german companies as well as [ 55 ] the reagan administration of the united states which also supplied iraq with `` satellite photos showing iranian deployments '' [ 56 ] and advised saddam to bomb civilian targets in tehran and other iranian cities . 
  [ 57 ] '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran%e2%80%93iraq_war#iraq_2 `` according to the stockholm international peace institute , the soviet union , france , and china together accounted for over 90 % of the value of iraq 's arms imports between 1980 and 1988 . 
  [ 172 ] '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_aid_to_combatants_in_the_iran%e2%80%93iraq_war well gee , it looks like both america and europe were behind saddam in the war .
