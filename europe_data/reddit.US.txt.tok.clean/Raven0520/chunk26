  i watched some of the sky news coverage of election night , my favorite part was when they interviewed the head of scottish labour after he lost his seat . 
  he claimed , `` no one saw this coming , '' m8 i live 2000 miles away in another country and i saw that coming . 
  how out of touch is scottish labour with the people they claim to represent ? 
  just let them have their fun m8, 
  `` fascist norway revives nostalgia for aryan past with jingoist military parades . '', 
  goddammit japan !, 
   including boots on the ground in gulf war i we 're so sorry for not letting saddam annex kuwait . 
   so then why is the bundeswehr deployment on occasion receiving statements saying `` sorry for that attack , we mistook your for americans '' ? 
  i guess [ these guys ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31477237 ) did n't get the memo . 
  or [ these guys . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/13/us-security-germany-trial-iduskcn0ix11120141113 )  you people have a knack for getting yourself hated . 
  mainly , by practicing wild abandon . 
  if islamists do n't hate you , you 're doing something wrong . 
  the red menace strikes again !, 
  are you talking about terrorist acts committed by muslims or acts of terror committed in the name of islam by islamists ? 
  the former go back far before al-qaeda . 
  you ca n't separate either from anti-colonialism and anti-zionism . 
  so the first big bang was munich , the reason your country 's counter-terrorism unit exists . 
  the muslim brotherhood started out assassinating british collaborators in egypt . 
  al-qaeda arose from the ashes of various mujaheddin groups fighting the soviets in afghanistan . 
  they attacked america first because we 're israel 's strongest ally , not because they think you 're any better . 
  i was not aware that native americans practiced islam . 
  killing islamists is islamophobic now . 
  no , you 've got that wrong . 
  first they came for the europeans who colonized their countries . 
  we were n't really isolationist , that only applies if you consider invading south american countries to be isolationist . 
  like the uk and their period of `` splendid isolationism '' that saw the empire grow to its zenith . 
  but you seem to be implying we were on the same level of moral depravity as the country who started the war along with the nazis by invading poland . 
  oh i thought you were joking that we should have invaded someone haha . 
  well the problem with your idea is that the soviets would have just steamrolled across the rest of europe . 
  sure we had nukes , but we could only deliver them with large , slow moving bombers . 
  temporarily embarrassed moldavians . 
  france is a pushover in victoria ii . 
   dacia good news !, 
  we 'd probably annex ireland before poland , or france for the food . 
  what exactly is wrong about an eu referendum , you do n't like democracy ? 
  [ `` and hitler wins in a landslide !, 
  '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_election_and_referendum,_1938#sudetenland ) damn fptp !, 
  better start stocking up on popcorn and salt . 
  i keep reading that as `` sudetenland . '', 
  book thief . 
  russia did ok . 
  now their only chance is a coalition with the greens and bnp . 
  no monster raving loony party voters here =(, 
  from an outsiders perspective , / r/unitedkingdom seems like a massive labour circlejerk , and / r/ukpolitics has a disproportionate amount of green party and ukip posts . 
  i think in general political subreddits have far more people from the fringe of politics than you 'd ever encounter in real life . 
  look at / r/mhoc , when it started out it was dominated by communists . 
  / r/politics used to be a ron paul fan club , now bernie sanders is the new based god . 
  maybe they are n't treated like human beings because they do n't treat women like human beings . 
  they literally think women are overgrown children . 
  just banter m8, 
  why is he not a mod of / r/circlejerk yet ? 
  we 'll sell you florida . 
  120 days of sodom is n't accurate ? 
  well it 's got the rape part down . 
  the popcorn overfloweth . 
  holodomor was just an accident . 
  you do n't even need to visit bubba 's gun store , they sell guns at walmart here . 
  my first gun was a mossberg .22 from walmart . 
  you can buy your guns , ammo , and fried chicken microwave dinner all at the same place !, 
  polish death camps . 
  estonia is nordic . 
  no , the red army . 
  neoliberalism . 
  thank you for your service . 
  why do people get offended by facts ? 
  ca n't barrage the farage . 
  dat pinochet doe, 
  when is the toothbrush moustache coming back ? 
  i do n't think you can separate hitler from germany and pan-germanism . 
  one thing i do n't understand about / r/europe is that i routinely see people claim the eu is undemocratic , `` neoliberal , '' corrupt , run by a criminal , etc. 
  yet this place is still a massive pro-eu circlejerk . 
  why would anyone want to give up their sovereignty to an institution like that ? 
  clear evidence of subliminal anti-russian propaganda by western corporations !, 
  \\  argentina \\  bestest nations hahahahahaha, 
  yeah we 're gon na fluoridate your water and sap your precious bodily fluids . 
  it 's not like this subreddit would give a single fuck if they cap 'd a muslim by `` accident . '', 
  i love how this subreddit turns into / r/conspiracy whenever the nsa or ttip is brought up . 
  obviously because we live in a fascist , oligarchic , imperialist , white supremacist , hegemonic , neoliberal shit hole . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s i searched through / r/askhistorians and / r/asksocialscience , and these look like the best answers .

  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/wiki/us_history#wiki_why_is_socialism.2fcommunism_a_dirty_word_in_the_u.s..3f ) tl ; dr our constitution , the cold war , wealth and plethora of land , religion , the `` protestant work ethic/american dream , '' heterogeneity and racism . 
  basically what wadcann said . 
  `` literal fascist pigs prepare to open fire with machine guns on innocent russian vacationers . '', 
  i did n't say those feelings were n't justified ... 
  i guess his football team is called `` the jews '' because they get massacred every time they step out on the pitch . 
  if he wants to troll americans he probably should n't use the flag of a country whose existence depends upon sucking our dicks . 
  you did n't even yell at me for calling your country holland , this is shit banter m8 . 
  but more importantly , why do n't you edit your flair to say `` netherlands '' so more people do n't think you 're israeli ? 
  i can find holland on a map just fine . 
  what percent immigrant would that make your country ? 
  they are n't immigrants , but they sure as hell do n't like travellers . 
  literally hitler . 
  gets worse , [ this cunt ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lnyozih.jpg ) is always on fox business news claiming climate change is a liberal hoax . 
  canadian nationalists are so cute though , droning on and on about how the avro arrow was the best plane that never was , about how they 're important because of the commonwealth , muh poutine , muh multilingualism , muh multiculturalism , it 's great . 
  did n't see that coming . 
  \\  the idea is that the `` peoples republic of palm springs '' can not rule over any area unless the people there want them to . 
  * unless 51 % of the people want it to \\  where there is collaboration necessary , there will be , but not outside of that . 
  you ca n't grow much food in a city , so there will have to be quite a lot of collaboration with farmers . 
  but because leftist anarchists want to abolish currency , it will take place without a means of exchange , aka a barter economy , which have never actually existed .
