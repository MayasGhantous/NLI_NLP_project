  i really do n't understand their hatred of money , it existed before capitalism , why should n't it exist `` after ? '', 
  can you imagine global trade without a means of exchange ? 
  \\  a state , on the other hand , would not accept farmers or cities creating their own communes due to their stark differing interests and experiences , because a state defines both of them as part of its territory , and claims authority over both of them , no matter what the people there say . 
  there are no autonomous regions in states ? 
  \\  every territory i thought there were no defined areas ? 
  \\  this is different form a state , which is an unchanging territory with a defined territory and all of the people within that territory are obliged to obey to the exact same government and state , having no freedom to challenge the monopoly on violence of the state . 
  but if 51 % of the peoples republic of palm springs decide they want to live in a neo-nazi governed territory , the only thing the 49 % can do is leave . 
  how is that better than what we have now ? 
  so rival governments can try and govern the same totally not defined area ? 
  his comics get removed too , even based jpaolo is not above the nazi mods . 
  because a government that does n't have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force is very useful .

  should we not criticize the soviet treatment of pows because some german pows did in fact die in british/american/canadian camps ? 
  that does n't explain the rapes of manchurian , korean , and chinese girls by the red army at the end of wwii . 
  it 's not a specialty , but the scale of the rapes was unprecedented . 
  no you do n't understand , it 's a government , not a state , it 's totally different !,

  can someone explain ( without blaming the j00s ) how sweden became so feminist ? 
  jan pawl will protest us from the greedy capitalists !, 
   or you would not have whole neighbourhoods centered around foreign cultures , like china town , little italy and so and so . 
  these places barely exist anymore , they are relics of the 19th century . 
  the people who once lived in them long ago moved out into the suburbs . 
   american identity is constantly changing because new immigrants are allowed to bring their culture and change american ways when they come instead of merging into cultural traditions . 
  could you give some examples of this ? 
  they are allowed to bring their culture and not assimilate if they want , but that 's not because the government actually encourages it , like in sweden . 
  assimilation does n't mean you have to completely drop all aspects of your native culture . 
   sure , we have our problems as well but we definitely are n't afraid to grab the bull by its horn . 
  so what is the french government doing to address the fact that an estimated 70 % of your prison population is muslim ? 
  people love to bring up the fact that 40 % of our prison population is black as evidence of how racist we apparently are . 
  or are you going to tell me those muslims are ethnically french ? 
  i 've seen greeks here claim germans and northern/western europeans are `` racist '' against them , i guess that means greece is obsessed with race . 
  maybe that 's indicative of his personal beliefs , not the entire country . 
  \\  of course it is . 
  \\  it is a melting pot . 
  you do n't see the contradiction there ? 
  why do russians not deserve their own nation state ? 
  who 's going to stop them from unifying again ?

  this answer largely depends on whether or not they 're a car enthusiast . 
  a lot of non-car type people in america see a german badge and think the car must be luxury incarnate and perfect . 
  they do n't realize that a base level c class is n't a big deal at all . 
  a phrase that gets thrown around a lot by car people about non-car people is that `` they want the badge but do n't wan na pay for it , '' so they buy a base level c class , a 325i , etc. 
  if they are n't a car person , the only british brand they can probably name is aston martin , and that 's just because james bond . 
  car enthusiasts are for the most part more concerned with the quality of the car , not where it comes from . 
  especially among young people these days , there 's far less of the `` buy ` murican cause chevrolet and apple pie '' mindset that people like my dad have . 
  among car people , german cars are thought of as being great cars , but ( in general ) more expensive to maintain . 
  buying used german cars is generally discouraged unless you can work on them yourself , especially audis . 
  there was a guy on / r/cars who financed a heavily used m3 right out of high school and the comments were tearing him a new one . 
  british cars are thought of highly , the jaguar f type gets a lot of love on / r/cars . 
  so does lotus , especially because of their commitment to making drivers cars . 
  everyone loves italian cars , especially the alfa romeo 4c . 
  when that car came out i really did n't understand the hype , but then i drove it in assetto corsa , and saw jeremy clarkson 's segment on it during the last season of top gear ( wow , that sucks to say ) , and now i do n't think i could pick any car over it for that price . 
  it 's such a beautiful car , i do n't care that it is n't particularly powerful or fast , it 's a work of art . 
  there are also a lot of volvo fanboys who swear by them , the volvo 240 is the car of choice for hipters , same with saab . 
  yeah , germans are so oppressed . 
  america is not multicultural . 
  if only the `` repay debts '' casus belli actually worked = /, 
  but we 're living in a mad world , that changes things quite a bit . 
   the main objective of europe is to end the milleniums of wars by strongly uniting all our nations . 
  this is not a cost but a fair price to pay . 
  i see this argument all the time and it strikes me like an insult to the intelligence of europe . 
  do you really think that without the eu , germany would invade poland again ? 
  it 's like when people say , `` russia needs an autocratic leader , they ca n't handle democracy . '', 
  merkel would have written a strongly worded letter to argentina . 
  argentina has been using its sole national focus on `` increase tension in the falklands '' for like 30 years .
