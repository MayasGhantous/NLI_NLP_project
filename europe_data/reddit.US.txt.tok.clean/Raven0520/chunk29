  \\  i equated turkish and american nationalism , not their particular atrocities . 
  you gave examples of american atrocities to support your argument that they are equal . 
  i contended that there is a difference between not apologizing for them and outright denying they happened . 
  i do n't think it 's fair to say that ignorance of something like the philippine-american war is on the same level as denying one of the worst genocides in history . 
  a significant number of british people still have a positive opinion of oliver cromwell , i do n't think that is equitable to denying the armenian genocide . 
  the two aspects of nationalism that you gave for turkey and america do n't seem unique to either country , all nationalists construct grand narratives of their history , sweeping the negatives under the rug .

  who 's fault is that ... ? 
  the turkish government . 
  you 're equating the american governments glossing over of and the population 's ignorance of things like the philippine-american war and agent orange to the turkish governments denial of the genocide of over a million people .
