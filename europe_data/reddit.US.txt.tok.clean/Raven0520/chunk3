  i know about that already , what does it have to do with the soviet union ? 
  fascists also had their own vision for a new man , does that mean fascism has penetrated our governments , academia , and society ? 
  the un is a joke anyway so why does it matter what some self-righteous bureaucrat has to say ? 
  of course the un migration chief is going to be pro immigration . 
  it 's no secret that capitalists want more cheap labor in europe , and that the eu is undermining your sovereignty . 
  it amazed me that people did n't get that back when this sub was still an eu federalism circlejerk . 
  a united states of europe means the eventual destruction of regional identities , to the point where the difference between a spaniard and a finn is no greater than the difference between a floridian and a californian . 
  do you want that ? 
  please explain to me how multiculturalism stems from marxism . 
  yeah ... no .

  get out of here with your reason and historical precedents , ca n't you see we 're trying to sensationalize this as if corbyn is literally salvador allende and the british military is a fascist junta ? 
  applause to this man for standing up for his brothers and sisters in the face of crippling austerity !, 
  nonsense , jeremy corbyn loves his country , so much so that he wants to share it with everybody . 
  like argentina .

  can you see russia from your backyard ? 
  7 years ago this sub upvoted a story about roma persecution ? 
  pretty sure jews do n't burn hot enough to melt steel beams . 
  now labour wants to take britain back to the 70s ... 
  you forgot trump . 
  just like you 've managed this migrant crisis so well . 
  this subreddit is such a joke now lol, 
  m8 , the source for those two sentences is a ** comment on an economist article ** and a russiatoday video . 
   how did we come to jews and neonazis ? . 
  because this conspiracy theory and gaddafi are quite popular with the top minds ^ tm of / r/conspiracy , and is usually accompanied by statements about how gaddafi was like totes red pilled on the zionists and nwo/zog . 
  are you not aware of the type of people who peddle this shit ? 
  so give me some evidence that gaddafi actually did any of that . 
  because i ca n't find any at all , a google search returns nothing but articles from globalresearch , russiatoday , commentisfree , and other shit websites . 
  conspiratards/neo-nazis are obsessed with the gold standard , which is odd because you 'd figure of all people , neo-nazis would be the strongest opponents to backing your nation 's currency with some shiny metal that is stereotypically associated with jews . 
  not to mention the fact that germany recovered from the post wwi depression by taking itself off the gold standard , and that the nazis had no problem printing worthless money and taking out massive loans to finance their war machine . 
  you and me . 
  then who would build mosques in europe for all your new friends ? 
  so when will we find out that the jews did 9/11 ? 
  we ca n't buy our oil from putin like you guys so we have to steal it from brown people . 
  just shows how socialist `` arab socialism '' really was . 
  this is what conspiratards actually believe .

   that 's not why you flee a country yes , watching your house get blown up by your own government and your family killed is no reason to leave a country . 
  these people are fleeing syria because their towns , their homes , their places of work have all been destroyed . 
  who has bombed them ? 
  the government , isis , and other groups . 
  are you seriously suggesting that millions of syrians should just flee into the desolate `` countryside '' to avoid airstrikes * by their own government ? 
  * where will they get food/water/shelter in this idyllic , tranquil countryside of yours ? 
  where will they work ? 
  you might as well tell them to go die in a hole .

  got ta bring nationalism into this somehow !, 
  i would n't have a problem at all with america taking these refugees . 
  but as i 've said before , america is a scary place with guns , christians , jews , and no welfare . 
  i do n't think these refugees want to come here . 
  because these refugees are only fleeing from isis , not the assad regime ... 
  that sounds like like a contradiction m8 you want the eu to intervene in syria like we `` intervened '' in iraq ? 
  dude , did n't you hear about that mongolian rape gang ?

  ### welcome to the rice fields mother fucka !, 
  now i 'm wondering if there are japanese who say they should import white people to solve their demographic crisis . 
  `` weaboos , we need boatloads of weaboos . '', 
  it 's role reversal this time , the germans are communists and the russians are fascists . 
  seems a lot of people here wish they lived in japan though . 
  but why are they rejoicing ? 
  why are they burning stuff ? 
  throwing rocks ? 
  why are they covering their faces ? 
  it 's still about context . 
  we 'll greet them waving israeli flags . 
  if a bunch of germans stormed the polish border yelling deutschland \u00dcber alles !, 
  would poles be in the wrong to be concerned ? 
  i have no idea , but since i 've never heard of a single hollywood movie about the holocaust , it must not have been important .

  i bet he has a panzer hidden in his basement . 
  i 'm sure whatever gas they 're using is banned in australia , ya know , for the children . 
  i learned geography through victoria ii , so yeah , war . 
  there has never been a significant communist presence in the uk , and the labour party was never socialist in the far-left sense of the word .
