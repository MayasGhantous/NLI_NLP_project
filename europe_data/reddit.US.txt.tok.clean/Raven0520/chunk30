  where did i say that white americans were not fatter than white europeans ... ? 
  if you have a set of numbers [ 4,7,5,6,8 ] and you add 20 to it , the average will be skewed to the right . 
  whenever a statistic like average income gets brought up here , europeans will say `` america is skewed because of all the rich people in that country . '', 
  no one objects to that , but i 'm saying the exact same thing here and i 'm wrong ? 
  and what do european women have to do with a statistic about americans ... ? 
  he is wrong in saying that `` black people make us look fat , '' he is right in that black people skew the statistics . 
  so he 's wrong and he 's right but he 's mostly an asshole . 
  but do you say cunt at the end of every sentence ? 
  to skew a statistic does not inherently mean to invalidate it . 
  african americans are a small minority of the us population , but are fatter than all other ethnicities , so they skew the statistics to the right ( more fat ) . 
  asian americans are a small minority and are less fat than all other ethnicities , so they skew the statistics to the left ( or less fat ) . 
   how the fuck are they skewing the numbers if they 're american ? 
  he 's not wrong , he 's just an asshole . 
  yes , [ black people are fatter than latinos , whites , and asians . 
  ] ( http://stateofobesity.org/disparities/ ) this is explained by their poverty , and the fact that companies like [ mcdonalds actually target african americans in advertising . 
  ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/magazine/content/10_29/b4187022876832.htm ) the south in general ( where most blacks live ) is [ fatter than the rest of the country . 
  ] ( http://calorielab.com/news/wp-images/post-images/fattest-states-2011-468.jpg ) they skew the statistics the same way gun enthusiasts skew our statistics on guns . 
  most americans do not own a gun , however , [ a significant portion of americans own multiple guns ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2610545/ )  in their comprehensive report , they found that 35 % of households and 25 % of individuals owned firearms , and estimated that there were 192 million working firearms in the us in private hands . 
  in addition to describing demographic characteristics of firearm owners , they were able to determine that the ownership of private firearms was highly concentrated among a small percentage of owners . 
  my objection to his comment is his claim that fat black people are responsible for our stereotype , the stereotypical fat american is most definitely a white redneck , who owns multiple guns and knows the bible by heart . 
  it 's not a fat black person or latino . 
  well you 're still alive , so that disproves the stereotype . 
  \\  fuck culture \\  thanks poland, 
  i almost want / u/jpaolo to make this into a comic but i think even the mods of polanball would find it too distasteful . 
  do n't you remember learning in grade school about the superiority of the anglo-saxon race ? 
  no , you blame your problems on the germans . 
  there were multiple comments by flaired users saying the post was biased , i saw the thread before it got nuked . 
  yeah , france is just a train ride away . 
  well we ca n't blame them on gypsies now can we ? 
   why would anyone want to move to the jewish state if they 're atheist ? 
  because judaism is an ethnic group as well as a religion , and modern antisemitism ( the nazi kind ) is largely based on pseudo-scientific racist theories about their ethnicity , not their religion . 
  no that 's suicide . 
   yes , let 's take control of the black people that did n't work out so well [ last time . 
  why switzerland and serbia ... ? 
  just to point out , that post was deemed incredibly biased in the [ / r/askhistorians thread . 
  ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/32wmgf/what_caused_the_bengal_famine_in_1943_was_it/ ) so much so that it was deleted . 
  honestly , i do n't get why mestizo people are n't considered white , the wikipage says that [ genetic studies in mexico ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mestizo#genetic_studies ) found most of them to have majority european heritage . 
  permission to say `` oh cock . '', 
  but the vast majority of all those countries inhabitants are ethnically european , they are the decedents of the colonizers , not the colonized . 
  you have n't answered my question , just put words on my mouth . 
  you 're just a protectorate of the hunnic empire , bow to your east asian overlords . 
  i 'm too much of a filthy casual for hoi3 , i tried getting into it , spent hours watching guides/lets plays and gave up . 
  like multiculturalism , invented in canada , popularized in europe . 
   before wwii began , nazis had less fatal plans for jews and slavs , that involved more repopulation the madagascar plan was never taken seriously , if that 's what you 're referring to . 
  plus , the first stage of the plan was during war time and was more centered around using resources of the occupied counties to feed the german army , not on exterminating the local population . 
  it would have gotten much worse * after * the war . 
  \\  soviet union with its purges , ethnic cleansing and directed famine is pretty comparable to nazi germany . 
  comparable , not equable . 
  \\  it is entirely possible , that had nazi germany lasted longer , it would 've somewhat normalised . 
  i 've never read that anywhere , ever . 
  could you cite a source that says generalplan ost was to be cancelled ? 
  it may have normalized for estonians because the nazis considered you to be candidates for germanization ( eesti can into aryan ? ), 
  but not for slavs . 
  morgan freeman . 
  ^ ^ i ^ believe ^ it ^ was ^ actually ^ nietzsche, 
   personally i think handing over some tiny islands with a population of a couple of thousand would have been preferable to a war that killed nearly a thousand people . 
  but would n't that set an awful precedent , could the people of gibraltar reasonably feel safe if the uk abandoned the falklands ? 
  no objections to those other points , however i would say that people seem to bring up her support of apartheid quite a lot , but did n't she also help bring about the end of rhodesia ? 
  also as terrible as it sounds , was homophobia really uncommon in the 1980s ? 
  the wikipage for section 28 says that surveys at the time found that 60-80 % of the uk found homosexuality to be morally wrong . 
  did she ever renege those views ? 
  started by a doctor in the uk but yeah ok . 
  that is pretty terrible . 
  were there any programs to help the now unemployed workers learn new trades or go to university ? 
  well to be fair , they almost partitioned themselves a few months ago . 
  no , but i 've never actually seen someone suggest alternatives . 
  what should have been done with those nationalized industries ? 
  well darkest hour is a hoi2 mod and it gets lots of praise , especially kaiserreich . 
  i do n't need to just murder children , in victoria ii i can murder whole families . 
  as japan i once made it my sole focus in a campaign to annex france and ethnically cleanse it of all those filthy frog subhumans . 
  [ i got bored around 1900 but by that time i controlled the northern half of france ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gmwvkx3.jpg ) and had killed a few million french people . 
  i called it , `` operation paris syndrome . '', 
  my other genocidal exploits include [ annexing belgium as persia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zdnldye.jpg ) and [ replacing the local population with aryan pops . 
  oh yeah and i [ secured some rubber for my starving factories ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mc0zn4y.jpg ) , idle hands are wasted money !, 
  do n't judge me . 
  you did n't answer the question , were they supposed to keep propping those factories/mines up ? 
  what about breeder reactors ? 
  i 've seen people claim you need to take an intro to macro class to understand victoria ii 's economy . 
  no , you really just need to spam liquor factories . 
  * smiles polishly *, 
   i think you could use war guilt to help drive the german people apart . 
  the soviets kind of did that for 50 years , did n't work . 
  i think you would essentially have to turn germany into apartheid south africa or rhodesia . 
  how would you stop these countries from unifying again ? 
  would n't you have to eradicate the german and french identities ? 
  how did you come to hold these beliefs ? 
  i always hear how libertarianism is `` an american thing '' and that `` libertarianism could never take root here [ in europe ] . '', 
  do you support the french welfare state or want to dismantle it ? 
  victoria ii  eu4 and ck2 i actually want victoria iii to be more complex than victoria ii , especially the economy . 
  the eu federalism that permeates this subreddit is about power , not prosperity . 
  the people who claim `` oh we do n't do nationalism here '' have just replaced nationalism for their country with nationalism for the pipe dream of a united states of europe . 
  putin is n't hitler and the soviet union was not worse or just as bad as nazi germany . 
  social democrats are not socialists , europe is not `` more socialist '' than america . 
  browsing this subreddit leads me to believe european politics are not `` better '' or more democratic than american politics . 
  i do n't think nato or the eu have an obligation to help ukraine . 
  arguing over who 's more racist , europe or america , is laughable and cringeworthy . 
  it belongs in the comment section of youtube videos , along with `` who won wwii ? '', 
  i would rather have a healthcare system like germany 's than the nhs . 
  when margaret thatcher died and reddit shut down for a few days i took it upon myself to read all the / r/askhistorians and / r/asksocialscience threads about her , because i had no opinion on the matter .
