  this needs to be a comic , / u/jpaolo . 
  fucking kiwis , always starting shit , we need them out of europe . 
  `` idf detected . '', 
  [ context . 
  no , because potato famine . 
  had no idea there was even such a thing as traditional irish food , i thought that 's why they all left and came here . 
  i do n't see how they are n't fascist . 
  autarky/protectionism ? 
  check . 
  nationalization of industry ? 
  check . 
  anti-immigration/xenophobic ? 
  check . 
  hatred of both socialism and liberalism ? 
  check . 
  claiming to be from outside the political class ? 
  check . 
  claiming to be on neither the right nor the left ? 
  check . 
  i do n't know what their views on defense spending are , but apparently she wants to bring back compulsory military service . 
  but i agree , it 's pointless to compare fn to any american party because we do n't have an organization analogous to the eu or eurozone . 
  the tea-party and ron paul fan boys are more comparable to ukip . 
  he did n't say there was no islamophobia , he said there are no notable fascist parties in the us . 
  the republicans are not fascists , no matter how hard people on the internet try to make them be . 
  true , that 's why i do n't understand eu federalism in the name of kicking out the yanks and rooskies . 
  like i said [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31cnn5/federal_europe_discussion/cq1qbqu ) , it appears to me that if you want to maintain the most sovereignty , you should leave both the eu and nato . 
  i would ask europeans in favor of a united states of europe in the name of getting `` sovereignty '' from the united states of america , what happened the last time a state tried to leave the us ? 
  if it really is to be a use , once you 're in , you 're in . 
  i would also ask them if they want to live in a europe where the difference between finland and portugal is the same as the difference between california and new york . 
  that is , different , but more or less the same . 
  never know when they 're gon na form a raiding party for old times sake ... 
  i do n't know man , [ look at that nose .

  no , is cube , only through j\u00fcdische physik can country into 3 dimensions . 
  neo-nazies tend to dislike america . 
  because we forced you to join nato ... ? 
  we cant even get you to spend the required % gdp on your militaries , what good is a bitch that doesnt pay up ? 
  i do n't understand your argument , you want to gain sovereignty ( from america , apparently ) by giving up sovereignty ( to the eu ) . 
  is norway our bitch ? 
  is switzerland ? 
  are those countries anyone 's bitch ? 
  it seems to me like if you wan na avoid being told what to do , unless you 're bordering russia , you should leave nato and the eu . 
  who cares if you 're irrelevant ? 
  i doubt norwedgians cry themselves to sleep every night because they 're irrelevant . 
  i doubt they care at all , same with the swiss . 
  it seems to me like eu federalism is n't about prosperity , it 's about power . 
  but if power is what you want , you 'll need to forgo some of the prosperity you already have and spend it on a military and a massive nuclear stockpile the likes of america and russia . 
  i fail to see how that is a worthy trade , if i was european i 'd much prefer irrelevance and unparalleled prosperity . 
  no , we asked merkel what to do and she said he can keep them as long as he incorporates austerity into his everyday life . 
  so op has to sell his kitchen sink , pants , car , and phone . 
  we have reason to believe he is a banana dealer . 
  i remember seeing a swedish person here say , `` sometimes i wonder if all these statistics are just made up to put the nordics at # 1 and everything else below . '', 
  we r anonymous , we r [ le ] gion , you have no power here . 
  ron paul could have prevented this , damn sheeple obama voters . 
  so in 2012 we were ranked 16th , above the uk and france , and in the course of one year drop to 28th ? 
  thanks , obama . 
  * grabs popcorn *, 
  itt : i want a to throw off the american yoke by making us more like america . 
  you 're supposed to extract money from your colonies , not the other way around . 
  how did you find this money op ? 
  * if you wan na hang out , you got ta peel it out , banana . 
  the comments here about `` oh my grandma said blah blah blah about the nazis . '', 
  no offense to these people , but your grandma did not know the intentions of the nazi high command . 
  just because the germans did n't go around drop kicking babies all day does not change that the fact they were there to exterminate you . 
  [ generalplan ost was to be carried out in stages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost#phases_of_the_plan_and_its_implementation ) , the first stage during the war , the second , large stage after the war . 
  it was in this larger stage that at least 80 % of poles would be murdered . 
  by 1952 , `` only about 3 -- 4 million non-germanized poles ( all of them peasants ) were to be left residing in the former poland . '', 
  your analogy fails because if what the soviets did was kick you in the balls , the nazis cut them off and shoved them down your throat . 
  it was to be the largest genocide in history , your very existence proves that what the russians did was not on the same level as the nazis . 
  was it terrible ? 
  yes , what is equable to generalplan ost ? 
  they 're still looking for that tea . 
  i was referring to literal rape , not just pillaging , murder , and destruction , which the wehrmacht certainly did plenty off . 
  [ apparently the ss were behind most of the rapes . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/19txk4/ive_heard_that_the_red_army_in_wwii_was_almost_as/c8rkz51 ) which is odd because you would expect them to be hardcore nazis and thus even more racist than the average wehrmacht soldier . 
  but i 've also read that the wehrmacht would set up military brothels with `` volunteers '' from the local population . 
  so a few days ago someone posts a thread about bismarck and it 's full of salty poles saying he 's literally hitler , and yet here there are poles literally defending hitler . 
  i do n't get it . 
  i wonder if poles are aware the reason the wehrmacht did n't rape their way across eastern europe like the soviets did was because it would have violated germany 's race mixing laws . 
  having sex with a pole was as disgusting to them as with a jew or black person . 
  ha , take that canada . 
  correct answer was temporarily confused russians , congrats you 're scottish . 
  rorschach test , what do you see [ here ? 
  da , i choose dis flair because fascist mods no let choose glorious flag of true motherland before putin and bourgeoisie pigs take over country . 
  now i criticize polan and no one is of suspect , instead think i am friend !, 
  because everthing in polan is of backwards and upside down xaxaxaxaxa xddd, 
  he 's on an italian carrier . 
  inb4 `` so why are they all trying to get here ? '', 
  i love how after the one guy fails out he just goes faster . 
  just a flesh wound . 
  that 's why they all left ireland and came here !, 
  [ no it 's still like that . 
  ] ( https://www.voeblogg.no/ ), 
  brrrrrrrrt, 
  fascism was explicitly created to be outside the left-right political spectrum . 
  so yeah , you can say republicans are to the right of fn , but that 's pretty meaningless . 
  i do n't think there is an equivalent of fn in the us , as we do n't have an equivalent institution to the eu . 
  it seems like that is basically their entire reason for existing , like ukip . 
  i guess you could say ron paul and his brand of libertarianism is sorta like fn , they want to leave nafta like fn wants to leave the eu , they want to `` end the fed '' like fn wants to leave the eurozone , but they would never support nationalization of industry like fn does . 
  i do n't know what fn 's stance on the military is , but ron paul is an isolationist who would drastically cut defense spending .
