  although i 'm positive it 's because muslims are evil and refuse to assimilate . 
  unlike in amerika where it 's because our cops are klan members or something . 
  it reminds me of [ this video ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/02/22/american-teacher-in-japan-under-fire-for-lessons-on-japans-history-of-discrimination ) , where a japanese history teacher asks his students if there is racism in japan . 
  the overwhelming response ? 
  no ... that 's an american thing . 
  could you show me where he said america was perfect ? 
  the cultural revolution was just bourgeoisie propaganda !, 
  never happened . 
  \\  british newspapers \\  elegant hahahahaha, 
  no we 're friends now , they make our shoes . 
  you got two rounds though . 
  i 've enrolled myself in a vehicular diversity course , maybe one day i 'll learn to love all the autos of the world . 
  do you watch top gear and throw objects at your television every time they take the piss outta a car or the people who like it ? 
  besides , my high horse is more off road worthy than most suvs . 
  does anyone advocate for just outright disbanding it ? 
  who 's gon na invade switzerland ? 
  to the contrary , we would be without red sox and patriot fans , and thus much better . 
  maybe we could sell it to ireland , otherwise it would become the plastic paddy republic of boston . 
  but the british recovered , the italians did n't . 
  but now you have to deal with edgy leftists claiming you invented the concentration camp and committed genocide , was it worth it ? 
  \\  barbarians doing barbarian things . 
  what ? 
  we did n't sack rome . 
  you had to resort to scorched earth tactics and concentration camps to beat some dutch hillbillies , i consider that a loss . 
  the fuzzy-wuzzies ended your flawless victory streak against the uncivilized , so i think they should get some brownie points . 
  and if you consider the aussies to be british , they lost to some birds . 
  i 'm sorry , what color is your cayenne ? 
  and the boers , and the zulu . 
  i will never understand how communists and anarchists can not explode from cognitive dissonance when they try to downplay the rape of germany and eastern europe by the soviets , while maintaining they are feminists . 
  i would n't doubt it , my dad was on the nimitz in the 80s and said they were always sunk first in war games . 
  i do n't know if things have changed since then , but he said they were always alone when at sea . 
  the only time they were ever around other ships was during wargames or for photo ops and stuff like that . 
  apparently they saw more russian ships at sea than american ones , they would watch the rooskies pick up their trash dumps . 
  a few years ago aston martin announced they were making an suv , and it was the most [ god awful thing i have ever seen . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5aqsdda.jpg ) then , after their old ceo left they apparently scrapped the prototype , [ by saying ] ( http://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/19/aston-martin-lagonda-suv-abandoned-report/#image-1 )  `` that was a different time [ when the lagonda debuted ] , '' reichman continued . 
  `` it was [ dr. ulrich bez 's ] time . 
  and now we 're in a very , very different time , with a different plan and with a different projection of what that brand should become . '', 
  what aston really meant to say was that they tied up the designers who created that failed abortion , shot them a few times , put them in the back seat of their prototype and pushed it off the cliffs of dover . 
  somewhere , deep in a vault underneath paris , is the one true internationally recognized political spectrum . 
  it 's made of solid platinum -- iridium , and is kept in a 100 % vacuum sealed depleted uranium shielded case . 
  three keys are needed to open the vault , and have been distributed to the three purest ideologues on earth . 
  their identities are kept secret , but some suspect kim jong-un ( leftist ) , barack obama ( center ) , and vladimir putin ( rightist ) , are the guardians of the keys . 
  the vault is patrolled by a coalition of us navy seals , sas , french foreign legion , and spetsnaz operators . 
  the si unit of measurement of the spectrum is hitlers , represented by the symbol ( h ) . 
  thus you have kilohitlers , hectahitlers , centihitlers , and so forth . 
  the spectrum is exactly 1 kilohitler long , with 0 hitlers being william godwin , 500 hitlers being siddhartha gautama , and 1000 hitlers being adolf hitler . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  but they 've done plenty of negative reviews and yet companies still let them showcase their cars . 
  they 've been mocking audi and bmw ( driven by cocks and middle management ) for years but those companies do n't care . 
  i feel bad for people who buy luxury suvs , when ever i see a porsche cayenne i just wonder how dull their life must be to have the money to afford a porsche , and buy an suv . 
  but i thought it was gold , not yellow . 
  they are saying sky would pick them up , and that they have boatloads of cash . 
  i believe they have broadcast rights for the premier league and f1 , so a car show with three cranky old men would be a drop in the bucket . 
  they would have to run commercials and thus everyone would accuse them if being sell outs whenever they like a new car , but clarkson could say whatever shit he wanted . 
  we all know nothing will happen , i saw the / r/unitedkingdom thread and everyone was saying another network would pick the show up in a milisecond . 
  apparently may and hammond have said before that is clarkson goes , so will they . 
  frogs ? 
  \\  germany was n't to blame for ww1 that 's very debatable and historians will continue to debate it for time immemorial . 
  how is it an oxymoron when african is not a nationality ? 
  it 's used interchangeably with `` black '' anyway . 
  but the entire situation is muddled because nationality in some places equals ethnicity . 
  hanging on in quiet desperation . 
  my eyes started watering when i saw that comic , it was so beautiful . 
  i 'd rather be killing communists . 
  fuck , someone took that already . 
  he don dropped outta newcastle primary m8 he ca n't count 4 shite, 
  they should have a polanball hall of fame , every year voting to put a few comics in . 
  after being subscribed to paradoxplaza and lithuaniaglobes i figured i 'd just sub here so i do n't have to look up the jokes . 
  i 've never understood why some people mock `` african-american . '', 
  it 's an ethnicity , not a nationality . 
  it would n't make sense for a black person in america to identify their ethnicity as `` american '' because there is no american ethnicity . 
  although in recent years white people who are unaware of their mixed european ancestry have just started putting `` american '' on surveys of ancestry . 
  the term has parallels in europe , the uk government classifies black people in britain as ( shocker ) [ black british . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_british ) in germany , they are [ afro-german . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afro-germans ), 
  i think they preferred ovens to deep fryers . 
  a germany without elsa\u00df-lothringen is no germany at all . 
  got ta spread the neoliberal agenda , in addition to feminism and cultural marxism . 
  and the dancing negroes !, 
  holy shit , everything makes sense now . 
  hell , according to some people , all our presidents are zionist jew-lizard hybrids . 
  that 's a minority and another species . 
  what about a georgian in russia ? 
  1 pp is worth at least 500 karma and a few months of gold in / r/conspiracy . 
  do n't hurt their self esteem , americans totally still live in fear of a nuclear holocaust like back in the 50s !, 
  i 'd guess there are probably some aboriginal canadians who hate canada , but aside from that everyone likes them . 
  is there a lot of dislike/hatred for switzerland in europe ? 
  i always figured they were one of those countries nobody hates , like canada . 
  nato did n't start the arab spring . 
  i recently watched an episode of * top gear * where jeremy clarkson drove a mclaren p1 through belgium on his way to spa . 
  he talked about belgium having `` three times as many roads , and 50 % more cars per square mile than we do in britain , '' and that , `` there are so many miles of street-lit motorway here that belgium is officially the brightest country on earth . '', 
  i was rather surprised how positive he was considering what he said about belgium in his series , * jeremy clarkson : meets the neighbors . 
  i just think it 's kind of funny that this subreddit complains about muslims not embracing `` european values '' like democracy and then some muslims in libya go and do exactly that and the response is , `` you were better off with that dictator . '', 
  [ the only libyan i 've seen talk about gaddafi on reddit surely does n't agree gaddafi was good for the country . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/2mhxo8/commemorative_holiday_post_the_worlds_shittiest/ ), 
  what if the asshole parasite was responsible for several terrorist attacks in europe ? 
  [ but they were . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11139345 ), 
  i 'm pretty sure france and the uk wanted the us involved in libya . 
  and no , most of the third world 's problems are the result of european colonialism .
