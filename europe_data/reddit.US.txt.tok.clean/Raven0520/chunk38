  my ancestry is scottish but my name is very english , i am sorry =( and i swear that is the first time i have ever mentioned my ancestry to anyone , you do n't have to worry about meeting scottish-americans with st. andrew 's cross tattoos and kilts they wear once a year . 
  `` you are either with us , or with the owls . '', 
   but on a much smaller scale than the us . 
  by what metric ? 
  that 's the problem with this absurd argument you always see on reddit about who 's more racist , europe or america . 
  no one ever produces real statistics to back up their arguments . 
  it 's just anecdotal evidence .

  yeah there 's no institutional racism in germany , i 'm sure when merkel declared `` multiculturalism has failed , '' it had nothing to do with racism .

  do blacks in west africa have ` black privilege ' ? 
  well privilege usually involves institutions like government , and those countries governments were set up by white europeans . 
  when they elect a government that goes against the interest of their former colonizers , things tend to go badly for them . 
  i think a better example would be zimbabwe , blacks there definitely have privilege over whites because their president is a corrupt , racist tyrant . 
  also , enslavement of blacks by arabs is still a huge problem in west africa . 
  an even better example would be everyone 's favorite homogenous asian country , japan . 
  ethnic japanese obviously have privilege over everyone else there . 
  there are koreans who have lived in japan since they were dragged there as slave laborers in wwii who still are not afforded the same rights and privileges as ethnic japanese . 
  i guess you could say the robbery was a. . . ( \u2022 _ \u2022 ) ( \u2022 _ \u2022 )  \u2310 \u25a0 - \u25a0 ( \u2310 \u25a0 _ \u25a0 ) clean sweep .

  guess what the top all time post is in / r/northernireland . 
  that 's actually a myth , most of the experiments were done haphazardly and in the name of sadism , not science , so they really are n't very useful . 
  the problem is that your comment is the standard viewpoint of left comms and anarcho-communists , not marxist-leninists , who outnumber all other types of communists . 
  a marxist-leninist would reply that stalin was simply adapting to the material conditions presented at the time . 
  they would argue the vanguard party is a necessity to bring about revolution because most workers do n't have class consciousness . 
  also , lenin ( in * the state and revolution * ) was the first to write about socialism as being the lower stage of communism , in which the state still exists and various relics of `` bourgeoisie society '' remain , like wage labor and property laws . 
  so stalin was n't pulling this out of his ass , unless you view lenin as also having misread marxism ( which maybe you do , i do n't know ) . 
  i think stalinism is the inevitable result of trying to `` implement communism '' in a world where capitalism has clearly not destroyed itself .

   we 're not really worth it to be defended by the us either , we are a declining continent , economically we 're starting to become irrelevant in the world , demographically we 're declining , we lagging behind in nearly everything in science and industry .

   i actually hate the way we commemorate wwi/wwii . 
  we go on and on about how they fought for freedom and saved us from blah blah blah . 
  wwi was about some inbred royal families and rich europeans exploiting the masses to secure more land and divide up the resources of other poor people . 
  the winners screwed europe up and directly created the conditions for wwii , where the whole thing happened again .

  the only african marxist regime i ever see praised ( by people who are n't lunatics and defend mugabe ) is burkino faso under thomas sankara , but even he outlawed labor unions .
