  this is progress !, 
  only a disgusting reactionary would oppose such a war . 
  do n't forget land mines , lots of land mines . 
  i did n't know authoritarian regimes that murdered tens of thousands of political dissidents could be considered progressive . 
  lets just ignore that the soviets overthrew a `` progressive '' but non-soviet aligned leftist autocrat and installed a puppet government . 
  i guess it only counts as a regime change when america does it ? 
  * estonian nazi vikings, 
  i 'm not accusing them of anything , i just think `` because holocaust '' is a pretty shit reason to take in refugees . 
  if germans want to take in refugees , they should do it out of compassion , not guilt . 
  the israelis do n't feel any obligation to these people because of the holocaust , neither should anyone else . 
  surely israel , knowing what became of their ancestors , will take in as many refugees from this awful conflict they can possibly shelter . 
  [ ayyyy lmao ] ( http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-syrian-refugees-israel-20150906-story.html )  he said that israel 's `` lack of demographic and geographic depth '' requires controlling its borders against both `` illegal migrants and terrorism . ''  his reference to demographics referred to oft-expressed concerns in israel about the country 's jewish population being overwhelmed by non-jews . 
  what a crazy world we live in . 
  nice b8 m8 i r8 it 88/88, 
   it 's hypocrisy . 
  nothing less , nothing more . 
  outside of eastern europe , we still learn that the soviets were the good guys in wwii , the glorious liberators of poor eastern europe . 
  before crimea , western leaders had no qualms about attending russia 's ve parade , in which they dust off their soviet uniforms and parade around like heroes . 
  who exactly is being hypocritical here ? 
  the romans burned carthage to the ground and murdered hundreds of thousands of civilians . 
  no one cares though , because it was 2000 years ago . 
  [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1j7mz5/what_were_the_factors_that_lead_to_rome/cbc25tc ) is a pretty great explanation of the extreme hatred rome felt towards carthage . 
  quick , someone post an article about the ira , this pettiness must continue . 
  i do n't think the danes are scared of your moat , or the romans , saxons , and normans . 
  literally every other comment in your post history is complaining about america . 
  for fucks sake , you went into / r/askanamerican and tried to argue hamburgers are n't american because they were ( allegedly ) invented in germany . 
  you might as well tell swedes they ca n't call meatballs a swedish dish , and by the way , india wants their curry back .

  russia is the fat , unattractive , misogynistic redditor who ca n't understand why no one wants to be his friend or have sex with him . 
  so he shitposts on the internet about how girls do n't like `` nice guys , '' and instead prefer d-bags like amerikkka . 
  russia does n't understand that `` not being amerikkka '' is n't a reason for anyone to like you . 
  instead , he buys into pickup artist bullshit and sticks to negging girls with low self esteem , like serbia . 
  she 's been fucked by pretty much everyone , even the smelly turkish kid no one talks to . 
   russia is like a big kid in class that everyone else bullies basically this is what russians actually believe .
