  it 's not like they chose to be russian . 
  or luton . 
  [ it looks like she 's wearing a sleeping bag . 
   we 've dared to veto a directive out of fear of what might happen . 
  merkel will write you a strongly worded letter !, 
  your argument is that european countries should ban guns ... because of what happens in america . 
  but you 're not in the eu . 
  i 'd rather be fat and pull my weight than skinny and still manage to drag everyone down . 
  mountain streams ca n't melt lead beams . 
  it 's a joke m8 also , that law has never been enforced . 
  we would petition to ban corbyn from entering the us , but being a communist is already illegal here . 
  i think [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_and_religious_beliefs_of_stanley_kubrick ) sums the film up pretty well ,  herr further wrote that kubrick owned guns and did not think that war was an entirely bad thing . 
  in the documentary stanley kubrick : a life in pictures , herr says '' ... he also accepted that it was perfectly okay to acknowledge that , of all the things war is , it 's also very beautiful . '', 
  the writer said of initial reactions to full metal jacket that `` the political left will call kubrick a fascist . 
  '' [ 2 ] in a 1987 interview with gene siskel , called candidly kubrick , kubrick said , `` full metal jacket suggests there is more to say about war than it is just bad . '', 
  he added that everything serious the drill instructor says , such as `` a rifle is only a tool , it is a hard heart that kills '' , is completely true . 
  is it really cynical about war , or just the human condition ? 
  generation kill  band of brothers, 
  lawrence of arabia ? 
  the bridge on the river kwai ? 
  the battle of britain ? 
  full metal jacket ? 
  the entire james bond franchise ? 
  hell , triumph of the will , a movie literally made by nazis , is regarded as a great and influential film . 
  shitting ? 
  \\  implying nigel farage is n't part of spectre, 
  space program !, 
  in that shitty canton where all the italian wage-slaves are kept . 
  if i had a dime for every time i 've seen this joke , i could afford to live in switzerland . 
  except lithuaniasphere comic makers . 
  aside from the romans , saxons , scandinavians , and normans , yes , a truly impregnable fortress you 've got there . 
   you do n't feel guilty because you 've won . 
  but then how do you explain japan ? 
   ww2 was not fought on american soil . 
  eh , technically it was . 
  the japanese invaded alaska . 
   how americans deal with the genocide of native americans and racial segregation going on up until well after ww2 by learning about it in school ? 
  because we learn about that in school . 
  sounds like a mitchell and webb sketch . 
  `` fucking racist yanks , kick 'em out . '', 
  * `` yeah !, 
  and the wogs too !, 
  '' * `` and the blacks of course . '', 
  * `` and the jews !, 
  '' * `` and the stupid irish dogs ! '', 
  * `` do n't forget the bloody poles !, 
  '' * `` i totally agree , fucking racists . '', 
  they are n't considered white because they are n't european . 
   ukrainians and slavs in general are not considered `` white '' by western europe and usa this statement is about half a century out of date m8 . 
  rekt, 
  or money trees , like they grow in norway . 
  america was n't being a dick , he just knew what happened last time someone got a free trip to poland . 
  they come across as quasi-fascists , but they apparently have no intention of destroying french democracy , so you ca n't really call them fascists . 
  still a better bond car than the bmws used by pierce brosnan . 
  sweden does n't want anything to do with sweden these days . 
  we need the french to help supply us munitions or we might run out !, 
  live in a palace and have a haram full of girls vs being a haram girl , the choice is obvious . 
  paint me like one of your kulak girls . 
  terrorists could communicate via smoke signals , we must ban fire . 
  / r/pcmasterrace would have a meltdown of euphoria . 
  to be fair , i 'd rather be turkish than related to the kardashians . 
  anarchists gon na anarchist . 
  so you 're saying ... we need to call poland . 
  who does n't wan na unite with norway ? 
  scottish nationalists in a nutshell . 
  i want them to be independent simply because their flag is so cool . 
  iceland stronk and united no separatist everyone happy together . 
  if you become a vegetarian , you are literally hitler . 
  are you a vegetarian ? 
  i think that 's how a lot of people view eastern europe . 
  when i think of that half of the continent i picture gray skies and abandoned soviet industrial complexes . 
  so nordic . 
  and i thought maoism could n't get any weirder . 
  i get it , merkel is n't taking climate change seriously . 
  thus , less snow . 
  hehe, 
  i ca n't even tell if you 're serious or not , but that was the funniest comment i 've read in a long time . 
  really surprised this has upvotes , considering your second bullet point . 
  why did we bomb serbian nationalists to prevent them from ethnically cleansing muslims in the balkans ? 
  why is turkey in nato ? 
  why are we friends with saudi arabia ? 
  pretty shitty way to wage war against islam if we 're aligned with the most powerful islamic countries on earth . 
  you can make a far stronger case that islam has declared war on judaism though . 
  why are n't jews blowing themselves up all over the islamic world ? 
  why do even non-palestinian , non-arab muslims hate jews so much ? 
   for a terrorist attack , this is really pretty pathetic . 
  you guys now have standards for terrorist attacks , like we do for mass shootings ? 
  beat your wife , apparently . 
  someone in europe has to . 
  ayyyyyyyyyyyyy, 
   you can choose the temperature . 
  it must be such a thrill for british people to go abroad and discover that in the civilized world we can actually choose the temperature of our sink water . 
  [ look at this nonsense . 
  is the water warm ? 
  no cry , only vodka . 
  i think it 's based off body mass index , [ where a bmi of between 25-30 is considered overweight . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overweight#/media/file:body_mass_index_chart.svg ), 
   motorized scooter you mean an italian tank ? 
  [ australia is almost as fat as us ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/anglosphere_2007_overweight_rate.png ) , this does not compute . 
  now it stretches deep into parts of british society , thanks to you , mr. blair .
