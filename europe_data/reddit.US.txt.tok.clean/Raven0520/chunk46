  canada is like soooooo imperialist , nothing ever happens there . 
  japan is so imperialist they basically colonized themselves at the end of the 19th century . 
  they must be stopped !,

  poland because who does n't root for poland ? 
  besides russia . 
  uk does n't count because they 're in the anglosphere , also known as the greatest assembly of nations on earth . 
  it would simply not be fair to the continentals to pit them against great britain on any country ranking list . 
  as you can clearly see this list was put together after extensive research and travel , and totally not based off lithuaniasphere comics . 
  what if portugal gets drunk and wants to form iberia ? 
  he should do porn . 
  eesti bringing the bantz . 
  russians on the internet : `` why does everyone think soviet union = russia ? 
  it 's not like the ussr was a unitary state in which all roads led to moscow or anything , also stalin was georgian and that 's totally relevant . '', 
  i do n't get it . 
  we 're gon na have to take your hard drive back to the station sir , ca n't risk leaving you in possession of any memes . 
  you might recall that a few months ago there was a massive increase in the rare pepe market , we ca n't let that happen again . 
  this stuff ruins people 's lives , especially inexperienced kids looking for their first high . 
  like jet fuel . 
  you can join isis and waltz right back to sweden into open arms , i think op will be fine . 
  put the meme on the ground and step away from the keyboard !, 
  are the finns really that weird ? 
  memes are serious business . 
  m ` fair lady .

  neo-cons are quite fond of jews m8, 
  but it continues !, 
  gypsies do n't pay taxes , because taxes are theft . 
  they believe in freedom of movement , not allowing the state to infringe upon their liberty with identification papers and other totalitarian tools of oppression . 
  the gypsy heeds no mere line on a map . 
  i 've also heard they specialize in the sale of `` counterfeit '' items , but this is really just a protest of the draconian system of intellectual property laws that plague our society . 
  the gypsy is a modern day john galt , a warrior against the tyranny of statism . 
  a nietzchean superman who scoffs at your dogmatic statist morality . 
  you hate them because you are the slave chained to the wall of shadows in the cave , the gypsy has broken his shackles , he has seen the light . 
  but when the gypsy returns and shares his wisdom , you kill him . 
  you hate him because he can see what you can not . 
  you hate him because he is free .

  no , you give us the poles , we give you the mexicans . 
  [ this comment ] ( https://www.np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/27v82c/cmvantigypsieroma_prejudice_should_be_viewed_as/ci4r8q3 ) from / r/changemyview was rather informative , if you assume the commenter is in fact roma and not just a troll . 
  she seems to know quite a lot about them so i do n't see any reason to doubt her validity . 
  gypsies are the embodiment of libertarianism and rugged individualism , what made america great . 
  they do n't let the state tell them what voluntary transactions they can and can not facilitate , like the sale of drugs or re-purposed automobiles , and they do n't let the state tell them how to raise their children , by keeping them out of school , aka statist indoctrination camps . 
  no wonder these commies hate them . 
  and those sexy halloween costumes , i do n't get these europeans , i 'd let a gypsy rummage through my pockets any day . 
  she might find something hard and valuable . 
  came here for this . 
  all i see are a bunch of countries with higher standards of living than russia .

   the coins ' excellent condition indicated that the owner systematically stashed them away shortly after they were made , the archaeologists said . 
  for some reason that person had buried them shortly after 294 and never retrieved them .

  top comment in the / r/unitedkingdom thread :  labour are an absolute joke . 
    +112 upcorbyns the end is nigh . 
  who actually votes for that vile woman ? 
   his personal views ( if they did n't change ) are against the eu as it is now . 
  corbyn says he wants to `` change the direction '' of the [ eu away from a `` free-market europe . 
  '' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-34272334 ) `` we are having discussions to sort this question out . 
  basically , on the question of europe , i want to see a social europe , a cohesive europe , a coherent europe , not a free market europe . 
  which makes little sense because that 's why the eu came to exist in the first place , as a free-trade organization , to build economic bonds between the countries of europe . 
  and like you said , the leaders of the eu are all `` neoliberals , '' so how does corbyn possibly expect to change the very nature of an organization as large as the eu by himself ? 
  i would say this quite nicely reflects what / u/exvampireweekend said , corbyn is out of touch with reality . 
   does this mean that corbyn is a neoliberal ? 
  but he supports them while throwing out this naive rubbish about changing the entire direction of the eu . 
  if corbyn was really as opposed to `` neoliberalism '' as his proponents argue , he would have to be a eurosceptic . 
   even though it might be just a metaphorical expression used to `` define '' the free market , most neoliberals really believe that a free market will somehow regulate itself to do what is best for the people and the society . 
  which is bullshit . 
  you 've never heard of negative externalities ? 
  they 're quite an established concept in economics . 
  the only people who deny the existence of them are austrians of the rothbard/mises variety , who have n't been relevant in like 80 years . 
  `` saudi arabia was a progressive , tolerant society before the american imperialists showed up ! '', 
   he is n't a neoliberal no matter what his stance on the eu is ( even tho ' he voted to leave the common market , and will probably vote to leave the eu ) . 
  corbyn has said before that his labour party will not campaign to leave the eu . 
   pro-privatization , pro-austerity , deregulation so exactly what the troika wanted for greece/portugal/ireland / baltics/etc ? 
  the eu seems pretty `` neoliberal '' to me , it exists to facilitate free-trade and dismantle protectionism , dismantle borders , promote a common currency , and its bureaucrats seem rather fond of austerity and privatization . 
   general belief in some imaginary hands . 
  the only imaginary thing is here the idea that mainstream economists believe in this absurd caricature promoted by leftists . 
   is n't a neoliberal how can you say corbyn is n't a `` neoliberal '' when he supports britain 's membership in the eu , the largest free-trade bloc on earth ? 
  the final solution to the feral problem .
