  according to the french government there is no such thing as an ethnic french person , so i do n't see how it 's racism ... 
  michael foucault invented `` racism = power + prejudice , '' so actually we should be complaining about them .

  for a country to go communist in the first place they usually have to lose cores/a great war . 
  i 've never seen communists get elected , and to do so myself i 've always had to spam elections . 
  russia usually ends up dismantled , bankrupt , and fascist in my games . 
  i 've only seen the soviet union form once and it then collapsed and went fascist . 
  i did see communist spain form once , which was funny because they had a massive empire spanning like 1/3rd of africa . 
  ironically , i once tried going communist as a boer south africa so i could assimilate the filthy anglo savages faster , but i never could get them elected . 
  and then immediately collapse and go fascist . 
  i wish i 'd been a girlie , just like muh dear ma-ma !, 
  what exactly do feminists think is `` non-toxic masculinity ? '', 
  i mean , we 're not supposed to imply things like cars , guns , sports , video-games , etc. 
  are `` masculine '' anymore because that would discourage women from doing them , so what is masculinity supposed to be ? 
  i always see feminists on reddit stress that they are n't against femininity , that is , if a woman wants to be a stay at home mom , cook , love the color pink , etc. 
  that 's * ok * as long as it 's her choice . 
  but i 've never heard the phrase `` toxic femininity . '', 
  what is supposed to define masculinity in a feminist society ? 
  what are men allowed to claim is uniquely manly ?
