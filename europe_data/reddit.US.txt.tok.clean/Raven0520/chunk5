  swedes on reddit seem much more right wing than their politicians and media portray sweden . 
  it 's odd because in a lot of countries the youth are stereotyped as naive leftists , hence bernie sanders , jeremy corby , etc. 
  that 's russia m8, 
  britannia rules the [ air ] waves . 
  no iceland ? 
  eesti is just too dank , ca n't pass up those fresh memes . 
  we must have taken all the hot ones back with us after the war , like the rocket scientists . 
  there are none left in germany ?

  self fulfilling prophecy m8, 
   the jews are the same as pigs , and if they were to draw a cross or even just look at a cross then they would lose their islamic power . 
  what the fuck did i just read ? 
  this is so fucking bizarre i do n't even know what to say . 
  i like how this is now the stock response every time more info on these pedo-gangs comes out . 
  because the british public was n't outraged at all by the jimmy saville revelations , or the pedophile cases involving politicians !, 
  nope , not at all , the whole `` pedo-mania '' the country experienced in early 2000s never happened . 
  [ in 2001 a british tv show satirized the countries media when it was in the grips of a mass hysteria over pedophilia during `` operation ore , '' an investigation by the british authorities on suspected pedos . 
  ] ( http://www.salon.com/2001/08/20/morris_13/ ) seriously , an angry mob of brits burned down a pediatrician 's house because they thought it meant he was a pedophile . 
  the police arrested who guitarist pete townshend because they thought he had accessed a child porn website . 
  [ the episode in question . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=23&amp;v=rcu7faeeznu ) where are you getting this notion that the british , or anyone , tolerate pedophiles who happen to be white ? 
  and why do you think there are so many cases of politicians being pedos ? 
  it 's almost like there 's a problem with the culture and atmosphere of high politics , these people think they 're above the law , that they can do anything , even have fucking pedo orgies . 
  yet no one would call me a racist for saying that . 
  but if you dare imply that the culture of rural pakistan might be part of the problem here , you 're a racist . 
  having sex with children in that part of the world is an [ accepted practice ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asksocialscience/comments/1unmri/how_widespread_is_bacha_bazi_in_islamic_countries/ ) , and as stated in the documentary posted elsewhere in this thread , a lot of it has to do with how sexist and repressive their society is . 
  do you really think people here are implying pakistanis are genetically programmed to fuck little girls and boys ? 
  no , it 's their backward culture and society . 
  leave the whataboutism to the russian trolls here please . 
  * my milkshake bring all the kafirs to the yard * * and they 're like * * can i be your martyr ?

  so you * want * israel , a state that exists for the protection of the jewish people , to force arabs to fight for them ... ? 
  `` swarms '', 
  he went to the noam chomsky school of geopolitics , in which everything the west does is inherently wrong . 
  that was beautiful , even better than [ this . 
  why are they throwing rocks at their houses ... ? 
  so meta, 
  i hear jeremy corbyn is their top mole in the uk . 
   the fact that they are n't required to serve in the army is purely because the state of israel does n't trust ethnic arabs , even if they are israeli . 
  if that 's true than why do they let arabs enlist in their military ? 
  why are there arab generals in the idf ? 
  according to the jvl , the reason they are n't conscripted is to [ `` spare arab citizens the need to take up arms against their brethren .

  how is it a double standard unless netanyahu is calling for europe to open it 's borders ? 
  if he was a pm of a european country , they 'd call him the most racist leader since hitler , he 's made comments in the past about the `` islamization '' of europe . 
  it 's hilarious to me that people do n't get this irony . 
  are you german-brazilian ? 
  tell them you want right of return to the fatherland , should go over well . 
  the bbc series , * jeremy clarkson meets the neighbors . 
  * like every bbc series it 's 100 % factual and completely unbiased . 
   ukraine is not european , for a thousand years it has been what could be considered as another russian region . 
  if ukrainians are n't european , italians are africans . 
   we 're doing something , and that something is sanctions , that btw crippled russian economy and broke the momentum that it had been gaining for the last 20 years . 
  for months this subreddit has been predicting the collapse of the russian economy , and yet russian users here continue to maintain the sanctions have barely inconvenienced them . 
  not to mention it 's been the filthy amerikkkan warpigs who have been [ pressuring the eu to put up tougher sanctions this whole time , ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/washington-pressures-european-union-to-apply-deeper-russia-sanctions-a-982271.html ) , and [ your government that has been hesitant to keep up the sanctions . 
  ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-ministers-divided-over-extending-sanctions-against-russia-1426504541 )  if you 're referring to the fact that we did n't even consider sending troops to ukraine , that can be very easily explained : we 're not war pigs like the us . 
  where did i say troops should be sent ? 
  ukraine needs weapons and equipment . 
  the only thing my country has sent are deactivated humvees . 
   hahahahahahaha an american , living in a country created from scratch a couple hundred years ago by some immigrants and criminals escaping prosecution talking about manufactured identity ? 
  i do n't see how this sad attempt at insulting america proves that the european identity created by accountants in brussels is n't a joke . 
   no , i honestly do n't know the difference between islam and islamicism ( except for the obvious grammatical differences ) , please enlighten me and post your sources . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_fundamentalism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_revival i do n't even know what you 're arguing , the rise and fall of arab nationalism is n't some conspiracy theory . 
  it 's an extremely important chapter in that regions history . 
  but this is / r/europe , so nationalism is inherently evil , especially ( gasp ) ethnic nationalism . 
  does n't everyone * want * to forget about ni ? 
  ouch . 
  thanks to us , only their tax collectors speak german . 
  we were talking about internal conflicts within a country , i hate to be the one to tell you this , but there 's an internal conflict going on in ukraine right now and the eu is doing nothing about it . 
  that manufactured european identity and unity means nothing in the face of russian gas . 
   the rest of your statement does n't make any sense because most of the arabic countries are also islamic . 
  so you do n't know the difference between islam and islamicism , and you ca n't fathom the thought of a muslim supporting secularism ? 
  slav culture was all stolen from africa . 
  you could try actually pointing out what was wrong with my statement . 
  you people wonder why the gulf states are n't taking any refugees , `` they 're arabs why are n't they taking in arab refugees !? '', 
  because the governments of those countries do n't draw their legitimacy from arab-ness , but from islam . 
  they do n't give two shits about their fellow arab . 
  even in switzerland they have green hair . 
  * the horror , the horror . 
   the idea of 3,000 people in calais , who have been through * unspeakable things * you mean france ? 
   european countries are now sufficiently homogeneous within themselves to avoid internal conflict . 
  how much longer will that last ? 
   middle east , on the other hand , is not . 
  different people , with different cultures and religions bundled up together by foreigners with total disregard of said disparities . 
  conflict was pretty much unavoidable . 
  because islamicism won over arab nationalism . 
  thanks in no small part to the west 's opposition to arab nationalism on the grounds it was anti-colonialist and anti-israel . 
   their country 's borders were drawn after wwi on a map by some frogs and some porridgeeaters . 
  as opposed to europe 's borders , that were drawn by the hand of god himself ? 
  i believe they call it * le bantre . 
  yeah i do n't get it , a frenchmen took a jab at england , shocking stuff eh ? 
  they 're working in conjunction with ukip , spectre , the nsa , and isis to get britain out of the eu . 
  my god , you must work at the local bnp headquarters ! 111, 
  how dare you joke about such a tragedy , i bet your grandfather was a guard at one of those polish death camps . 
  crashed and burned , just like their planes . 
  but why would anyone invade switzerland ? 
  some swiss people seem embarrassed by their lax gun laws , i do n't get it . 
   hitler shared a number of socialist ideals .
