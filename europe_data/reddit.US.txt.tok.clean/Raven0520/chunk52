   they won support suddenly by propagating fptp voting system instead of current proportional one say what ? 
  [ best alternate flag in europe !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/flag_of_lithuania_%28state%29.svg ), 
  is it lithuania day on / r/europe ? 
  i was being sarcastic , poles like to call themselves `` central european '' so they can get put in the same region as germany , switzerland , austria , etc. 
   eastern europe will never be rich . 
  ever . 
  we all know that . 
  i mean , south koreans might have said the same thing 40 years ago . 
  what about central europe ? 
  why not invest in eastern poland ? 
  yeah , that 's why libya 's constitution and legal system under gaddafi was based on the quran . 
  ah yes , it 's the western media making assad look bad , in reality he 's a benevolent , secular leader . 
  just like gaddafi . 
  are most of them not ? 
  well the majority of syrians are fleeing the assad regime , so if you think russia is actually helping resolve the migrant crisis you are mistaken . 
  i do n't think tony blair needed to start a war to flood the uk with muslims , he was just fine doing that on his own accord . 
  how are they similar to ukip in any ways besides being eurosceptics and anti-immigration ? 
  what about russian influence in the world ? 
  the top post of all time in / r/northernireland is quite interesting . 
  wow , an honest to god ira supporter , this is the first time i 've seen one on reddit . 
  you should do an ama on / r/ukpolitics . 
   it sets a precedent , the next banker , if he 's not stupid , will think a bit about the guys that went to jail before risking his country economy . 
  so all this i hear about `` in europe we do n't punish , we rehabilitate '' does n't apply to bankers , just rapists and murderers ? 
  from now one we should only use roman numerals in this subreddit , to honor the contributions of the great italian mustard race to european civilization . 
   united kingdom of great britain and europe sick banter m8, 
  tonight on * fox news ... *, 
   the us could have threatened the ussr . 
  with what ? 
  our massive nuclear arsenal that did n't exist yet ? 
   and yet eastern europeans treat syrian refugees as subhuman poland = literally nazi germany , as we speak they are throwing syrian babies into the ovens . 
   in much the same way as many western europeans treat eastern europeans . 
  i do n't think any eastern europeans here would even agree with that . 
  nigel farage going on television and saying your people smell bad is not the worst thing in the world . 
   it 's ironic as fuck . 
  it would only be ironic if eastern europeans were encouraging their countrymen to emigrate en masse to western europe . 
  since that 's not the case , i do n't see any irony . 
  what is ironic is that these refugees do n't even want to live in eastern europe , they want to go to germany !, 
  germany !, 
  germany !, 
  and new sweden ^ tm . 
  why do n't they want to live in eastern europe ? 
  because its poor , why is it poor ? 
  because eastern europeans were subjected to 50 years of occupation by a marxist , feminist , and `` anti-racist '' ( only in name ) state . 
  now they 're being criticized by western european marxists , feminists , and `` anti-racists '' for not being marxist , feminist , and anti-racist enough . 
  that 's some irony . 
  why should a country like poland even care what western european pinkos think ? 
  your country ( and france ) betrayed them and sat idle while they were gang raped by nazis and communists . 
  why should eastern europeans who actually live in eastern europe care about people who abandoned their countries ? 
  why ? 
  only nazis take pride in the achievements of their ancestors , a german here told me so . 
   `` when i 'm on another continent , i see eyes shine when those i visit talk about europe . 
  and when i return to brussels or luxembourg , i find myself in a valley of fears , a valle lacrimarum . 
  we do not know who we are , and we are not proud of the solid achievements of our predecessors . '' wow , had no idea he was such a racist . 
  bullshit , no one that old is browsing / r/socialism . 
  but i thought only americans pretending to be europeans on the internet complained about liberals ? 
  he said `` liberal '' 36 times in that speech . 
   caucasian converting to an afroamerican . 
  [ lol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rachel_dolezal ), 
  can you get me nigel farage 's autograph on a pith helmet ? 
  thanks . 
  are you being serious ? 
  oh my god he has 88 in his username it 's another estonian ss veteran !, 
   hey friend , what extremist groups in europe are well known for being anti-jews ? 
  muslims ? 
  communists ? 
  anarchists ? 
  oh that 's right they 're just `` anti-zionist , '' wink wink . 
   a weapon which divides and severes . '', 
  meaning christianity will be divisive because non-believers will hate you for it . 
  it 's not a call to violence . 
  i was being sarcastic m8, 
  maybe they can apply for asylum in austria , although i fear the two cultures may be too different for successful integration . 
   churchill caused you state that like it 's a fact . 
  the bengali famine gets brought up on / r/askhistorians every once in awhile and there 's always tons of debate . 
  the last big thread was deleted by the mods because there was so much shit throwing . 
  here are some pretty civil threads that shed light on the debate : https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/267rzg/what_exactly_caused_the_bengal_famine_of_1943_and/ https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/113agf/was_british_rule_a_cause_of_the_repeated_famines/  palestinians are savages who eat camel shit ( yes , he actually said that ) you probably should n't look up gandhi 's views on black africans . 
  historical figures should be judged within the context of their time . 
  what , you do n't wan na imagine europe as one giant belgium ? 
  does n't that sound like fun ? 
  [ first result when i googled that . 
  ] ( http://www.gotquestions.org/jesus-sword.html )  in matthew 10:34 -- 36 , jesus said he had come at this time not to bring peace to the earth , but a sword , a weapon which divides and severs . 
  as a result of his visit to the earth , some children would be set against parents and a man 's enemies might be those within his own household . 
  this is because many who choose to follow christ are hated by their family members . 
  this may be part of the cost of discipleship , for love of family should not be greater than love for the lord . 
  a true disciple must take up his cross and follow jesus ( matthew 16:24 ) . 
  he must be willing to face not only family hatred , but also death , like a criminal carrying his cross to his own execution . 
  true followers of christ must be willing to give up , even to the point of `` hating '' all that is in our lives , even our own families , if we are to be worthy of him ( matthew 10:37 -- 39 ) . 
  in so doing , we find our lives in return for having given them up to jesus christ . 
  so yeah ... the meaning is pretty much the exact opposite of what you 're implying . 
  i think it 's hilarious that you 're droning on about muh superior islamic civilization and then telling people to go to / r/askhistorians . 
  the historians there will tell you there is in fact no such thing as a `` superior '' civilization . 
  this guy thinks the dark ages were real , kek . 
   unpopular, 
  that 's pretty open . 
  but ... they 're mountain jews . 
  open borders are pretty liberal . 
  that 's pretty optimistic m8, 
  who pissed in your wheaties this morning ?
