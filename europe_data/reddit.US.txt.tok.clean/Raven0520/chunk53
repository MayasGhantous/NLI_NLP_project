  i thought you were responding to his claim that  historically nazi/fascist/nationalist parties have been actually far right . 
   it is an image that will haunt conservationists : one of africa 's most majestic creatures lying dead on the ground as a white western hunter poses proudly by its side . 
  i really do n't get why him being white is relevant . 
  he paid an absurd amount of money to travel to an african country , one whose government is racist against whites , and with the help of a black african guide , legally shot an elephant . 
  yep , he 's literally cecil rhodes ... 
  cartoons ? 
  libertarians and anarcho-capitalists are n't conservatives , but they 're also far-right . 
  does n't make much sense in light of that . 
   there 's no reason for the vast majority of muslims to ` leave ' what they believe in . 
  there 's no reason to leave a patriarchal , repressive religion that demonizes healthy human sexuality ? 
   to define islamophobia is very simple : you 'll know intuitively what ` antisemitism ' is . 
  just replace ` jews ' with ` muslims ' and you 're got a clear view of what is islamophobia . 
  but there are different types of antisemitism , that of the nazis was not about the jewish religion , but the jewish race . 
  so it was racism in every sense of the word . 
  saw the title and thought , `` diane abbot takes the bus ? '', 
  do you also think slut walks just exist to antagonize rapists ? 
  how long until someone unironically burns a bunch of them in protest ? 
  nice . 
  to the barricades , comrade !, 
  ca n't stand the heat , get outta the kitchen . 
  occupy them for 50 years ? 
   for example saxony , where the major nazi protests and many of the terrorist acts occur , has less than 0,5 % muslims . 
  maybe because they want to keep it that way ? 
  i do n't understand this argument , and i see it all the time here . 
  if it 's true , why do greeks and italians ( whose countries are the arrival points for these migrants ) , [ want less immigration more than anyone else in europe ?

   orwellian repression in eritrea . 
  at the hands of a black-nationalist leftist government ? 
  why would a socialist criticize eritrea ?

  came here for the `` columbus was literally hitler '' comments . 
  what ? 
  is that not the most beautiful flag in history ? 
  i thought it was red and gray , to be honest . 
  this flag is said to have been delivered to the prophet joseph smith by lord jesus christ himself , who descended from the heavens in a rainbow chariot spitting flames out the back .

   japan never really did it , hence the constant conflicts with neighbours .

   not the interpretive retelling . 
  the `` about the author '' section on amazon for [ his book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-president-pope-prime-minister/dp/159698550x ) states he was a `` special advisor to margaret thatcher ; met ( and as a journalist covered ) president reagan on a number of occasions both official and private ; as well as wrote about and had the privilege of an audience with pope john paul ii . 
  a distinguished international journalist , he has been associate editor of the times , editor in chief at national review , and editor in chief of united press international . 
  he is currently a senior fellow at the hudson institute in washington , d.c. '' i think that gives a little more credence to his words , they 're not just `` interpretive retelling . '', 
  why do people post articles without even reading the whole thing ? 
   this seemingly confirms some brits ' long-standing suspicion that the u.s. was `` tilting '' toward buenos aires throughout the war . 
  but the minutes contradict this in two ways . 
   first , the nsc was meeting to discuss and , in the event , to decide on a `` tilt '' toward the british . 
  at this stage the tilt was more symbolic than practical ; a white house statement blamed buenos aires for the breakdown of negotiations -- which , anyway , were to resume shortly with the peruvian foreign minister offering a rehash of haig 's ideas ( `` haig in a poncho '' to the brits ) .
