   second , haig 's main supporter in the meeting was u.n. 
  ambassador jeane kirkpatrick , usually his nemesis . 
  more powerful players -- defense secretary caspar weinberger and central intelligence agency deputy chief bobby inman -- favored a sharper alignment on the british side . 
  but since things were going their way , they said little .

   they did n't even help us in the falklands conflict .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falklands_war#position_of_third_party_countries  the united states was concerned by the prospect of argentina turning to the soviet union for support , [ 29 ] and initially tried to mediate an end to the conflict . 
  however , when argentina refused the us peace overtures , us secretary of state alexander haig announced that the united states would prohibit arms sales to argentina and provide material support for british operations . 
  both houses of the us congress passed resolutions supporting the us action siding with the united kingdom . 
  [ 30 ]  the us provided the united kingdom with military equipment ranging from submarine detectors to the latest missiles . 
  [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] president ronald reagan approved the royal navy 's request to borrow the sea harrier-capable amphibious assault ship uss iwo jima ( lph-2 ) if the british lost an aircraft carrier . 
  the united states navy developed a plan to help the british man the ship with american military contractors , likely retired sailors with knowledge of the iwo jima ' s systems . 
  [ 35 ] france provided dissimilar aircraft training so harrier pilots could train against the french aircraft used by argentina . 
  [ 36 ] french and british intelligence also worked to prevent argentina from obtaining more exocet missiles on the international market , [ 37 ] while at the same time peru attempted to purchase 12 missiles for argentina , in a failed secret operation . 
  [ 38 ] [ 39 ] chile gave support to britain in the form of intelligence about argentine military and early warning radar . 
  [ 40 ] [ 41 ] throughout the war , argentina was afraid of a chilean military intervention in patagonia and kept some of her best mountain regiments away from the falklands near the chilean border as a precaution .

  you could probably convince them that the armenian genocide was n't real genocide because armenians are white christians and thus more privileged than turks . 
  i 'm pretty sure those people view russia and putin as the saviors of europe .

  it 's another possible explanation for his actions . 
   yes he did , in sweden . 
  he does n't have a right to asylum in his country of choice .

   you seem very well-informed in everything else you talk about regarding this .

  they could even be such stalinists that they 're actually against the lgbt rights movement and `` identity politics '' because they believe gay rights are divisive ( only class matters ! ), 
  and unimportant or just a token thrown down to liberals by the bourgeoisie to make them feel like they 're accomplishing something . 
  soviet marxists had really strange beliefs about homosexuality , thinking it was a side effect of bourgeoisie decadence and fascism , because so many members of the sa were gay . 
  stalin also rolled back much of the feminist rhetoric of his soviet predecessors to encourage women to stay at home and have glorious babies for the motherland . 
  muh dialectic nature of history or some bullshit like that . 
  to these people , the fact that islamists are `` anti-imperialists '' is enough to overlook their quasi-fascist beliefs .
