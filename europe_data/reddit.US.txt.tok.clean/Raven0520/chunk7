  we do n't learn all that much about the specifics of the war , like the ss . 
  which leads to this dumb view among pop history fans that the ss were like the german special forces , and `` omg they had the coolest uniforms . '', 
  there is a scene in * band of brothers * where they encounter a captured german-american soldier . 
  they have a cheerful conversation about home , and then go on their merry way . 
  their lieutenant then comes back , offers him a cigarette , and proceeds to machine gun him and the entire group of pows . 
  that 's probably the first time many americans learned about such defectors . 
  as for the real story of that massacre apparently it has never been substantiated . 
  the guy who wrote the book the hbo series was based on was a historian who , after his death , was outed as a plagiarist and fabricator .

  abbot was probably driving the truck himself , that fucking cunt .

  ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/statues_of_otto_von_bismarck ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-polish_sentiment#anti-polish_sentiment_.28to_1918.29  in prussia and later in germany , poles were forbidden to build homes , and their properties were targeted for forced buy-outs financed by the prussian and german governments . 
  bismarck described poles , as animals ( wolves ) , that `` one shoots if one can '' and implemented several harsh laws aimed at their expulsion from traditionally polish lands . 
  the polish language was banned from public , and ethnically polish children punished at schools for speaking polish . 
  [ 32 ] poles were subjected to a wave of forceful evictions ( rugi pruskie ) . 
  the german government financed and encouraged settlement of ethnic germans into those areas aiming at their geopolitical germanisation . 
  [ 33 ] the prussian landtag passed laws against catholics . 
  \\  we 're not americans \\  yolo_swagovic, 
  jet fuel ca n't fill polish streams . 
  i heard they found the remnants of a polish death camp . 
  a plus sign . 
   it 's surprinsing to see them always protesting knowing that they do n't have any significant immigrant population in their countries . 
  maybe it 's because they want to keep it that way . 
  maybe it 's because some of them already have significant russian minorities who have no desire to stop being russian anytime soon . 
  maybe it 's because they spent 50 years being occupied by a foreign country who tried to systematically destroy their culture and national identity . 
  or maybe russiatoday is right and they 're all neo-nazis , hey man i do n't know . 
  * q : what 's the difference between a capitalist fairy tale and a marxist fairy tale ?

  in the civilized world they take out their iphones and yell `` worldstar , worldstar !!! '', 
  there have been millions of pages written on why europe is what is it , but yes , saying `` europe is rich cause they stole from africa !, 
  ! 1 '' is a gross simplification . 
  problem is that people like gross simplifications . 
   it 's capitalism , it 's what happens . 
  it 's the belief that some people should be better off than others . 
  he should tell that to the millions of poles who came to britain to escape the remnants of anti-capitalism . 
  surprised i had to scroll all the way down to find this . 
  pretty sure the evil tories will have destroyed the nhs by 2025 . 
  there is only one man who can stop them , the chosen one , savior of labour , killer of capitalists , liberator of palestine , jeremy corbyn , peace be upon him . 
  well that was terrifying .

  i was under the impression that ak clones were cheap , seeing as how many eastern block countries used them .

  well i just got done watching * triumph of the will * . 
  not gon na lie i was pretty bored , soundtrack was cool though . 
  according to wikipedia the film is banned in germany , which seems odd to me as watching it really drives home how creepy and obsessive the cult of personality around hitler was . 
  i would almost recommend watching it for that reason . 
   the terminology is so vague as to be meaningless thatsthepoint.jpg, 
   friedman objected to being called a neoliberal . 
  maybe because it 's a pejorative term , do any critical theorists identify as cultural marxists ? 
  as judo-bolsheviks ? 
  of course not . 
   it 's not the bailout itself that 's the problem , it 's the way it was instituted . 
  i 'm not endorsing their views , just stating that it makes little sense to refer to political parties that advocate bailouts and state intervention in the economy as `` neoliberals '' when the gist of `` neoliberlism '' is that the state should remove itself from the economy . 
  well the term neoliberal gained prominence referring to austrian and chicago school economists like milton friedman and friedrich hayek , neither of whom i think would have supported bailing out the financial sector in the first place . 
  so yeah , what i already knew , anyone who is n't anti-capitalist is a neoliberal according to the anti-capitalist left . 
  it 's a shibboleth . 
  [ welcome to america !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s2d3kkp1rg ), 
  i used them as an example because i ca n't think of a political party in europe that has been referred to as `` neoliberal '' by their opponents more than ukip . 
  but if the term does n't even apply to a party which self identifies as a new take on classical liberalism , maybe it 's a useless term . 
   does that mean that one has to be anti-eu to qualify as a neoliberal ? 
  well that 's another thing i do n't understand about the european left , why they tend to support what is essentially the second largest free trade block in the world , the eu . 
  seems like the only european leftists who do n't support the eu these days are communists . 
  according to your definition , ukip , a party which literally refers to itself as a new `` classical liberal '' party , is not neoliberal . 
  they want to replace eu migration to britain with immigration from the commonwealth ( aka brown people ) . 
  we 're not very fond of crowns over here . 
   neoliberal `` neoliberals '' want open borders . 
  what a sore loser . 
  if russiatoday was around in 1989 i bet this is what they 'd say . 
  isis started hiring . 
  you do n't yearn for the days when everyone was a subsistence farmer and like 1/10th of babies died in childbirth ? 
  `` probably a dane . '', 
  yeah , the ottoman empire had nothing to do with the exploitation of africa and the middle east . 
  it 's totally irrelevant to this discussion . 
  you seem offended . 
  if you 're being serious , slave roles in the ottoman empire were [ highly racialized . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/13j4ct/can_anybody_describe_the_institution_of_slavery/c77c9dr ) white and black males were sent to the military or castrated and used as guards , black women were used as house servants , white female slaves were used as harem girls . 
  so if we 're gon na reverse colonize turkey , i want first pick for my harem . 
  such as ? 
  i hate to break this to you but america did n't enter the war until 1941 . 
  i do n't see how that 's a uniquely american opinion at all .

  you can totally blame the soviet leadership , because they lied to the whole damn world about it . 
  their internal investigation was a sham , so much so [ that the guy in charge killed himself . 
  since no one else even had a gun , he was basically playing offline with bots on `` harmless . '',
