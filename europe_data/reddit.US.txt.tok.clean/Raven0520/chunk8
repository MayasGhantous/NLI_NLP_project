   look at london , you ca n't have an armed officer on every london bus or tube train , you would need thousands .

  germanic propaganda . 
  for decades there has been a concentrated effort to brainwash our children with the supposed merits and achievements of the german race , all lies . 
  cultural teutonism has soiled our universities and nested in the banals of academia . 
  we are told ( by the german run media , no less ) germans are smart , efficient , and hard working , yet it is only through the tricks and lies of the eurozone project that they achieved their current level of economic dominance . 
  the germans control the banks , and he who controls the banks controls everything . 
  moving behind the shadows , the german leaves no trace of his work . 
  when he appears before the masses , his true intentions are cloaked in hollow rhetoric , `` for greater european unity , '' they told you , surrender your monetary sovereignty . 
  but what is `` unity '' if achieved with chains ? 
  subjugation , exploitation , and the germanization of your culture , until your countrymen are nothing more than empty receptacles for german media . 
  the future is bleak for a europe that continues to close its eyes and ignore the german question . 
  but times are changing , eurosceptic parties are on the rise across europe , the masses are becoming wise to the german and his ways . 
  this will be the struggle of the 21st century , this is my struggle . 
  nazism was just a pathetic attempt by the degenerate huns to into nordic . 
  they even had the gall to suggest [ this flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/proposed_german_national_flag_1948.svg/1100px-proposed_german_national_flag_1948.svg.png ) after we won .

  aside from statistics that indicate a higher percentage of welsh people speak welsh than irish who speak irish , the attitude towards the respective languages i 've observed on this subreddit seem rather different . 
  i 've seen irish people say the way the language is taught in school is awful and that few take it seriously . 
  those who do apparently look down on their countrymen who do n't speak the language , leading it to have a snobby and elitist reputation . 
  do n't know if it 's true or those posters are just jaded or something , but i 've never seen any similar comments about welsh by the welsh users here . 
  john lennon was actually singing about making the world french in his song * imagine .

  wales got it 's own parliament in the late 90s .

  interestingly , the welsh have done a better job at preserving their language than the irish and scots .

  is it antisemitic to criticize zionism ? 
   a patriot does not love people and countries in general . 
  a patriot loves the best country and people in the world : the one he happened to be born in . 
  wait , so loving something implies you think it 's the best and most perfect in the world ? 
  i guess 99.99 % of marriages in the world are shams because i 'm pretty sure most people admit their partner has flaws .

  because european cars are not objectively better than american and japanese cars ? 
  because the ford f150 has been the best selling car in the us for 32 years in a row ? 
  [ these were the three best selling cars ] ( http://autocontentexp.com/20-best-selling-vehicles-in-america-april-edition/ ) in the us of q1 2015 1 . 
  ford f series 2 . 
  chevy silverado 3 . 
  dodge ram op seems to be under the impression that with ttip european car companies will sell their cars in the us for the same price as they do in europe , why would they do that ? 
  is ttip going to drag the north american and european continents together , eliminating the cost of shipping ? 
  is it going to change the fact that the us uses its [ own system of safety regulations ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_motor_vehicle_safety_standards ) what exactly do european car manufacturers offer that is so fantastic that it will destroy the american auto industry that can not already be obtained here ... ? 
  which chrysler sale are you referring to , because they were bought by mercedes in 1998 , then recently by fiat . 
  ford did n't go bankrupt like gm during the 2008 crisis , they took government money but their situation was n't as dire . 
  what must that say about the girls ? 
  so why have n't ford and gm been bought by toyota ? 
   i do n't even see their car industry surviving unless bought off by eu giants . 
  hahahahahahaha oh my god you 're being serious .
