  see with that gif i ca n't tell who you 're making fun of . 
  if his problem with americans posting here is that we 're disproportionately represented , why did he also mention australians ? 
  there 's only a few hundred users here with that flair , they 're hardly noticeable , and the most active australian user here is a guy who lives in poland . 
   i still have to think about how i weigh the ` white non-european ' part of your comment though ... is the white man oppressed again ? 
  is it fair to declare a country as white if a sizeable amount of their populations is n't ? 
  was this a little bit racist ? 
  i 'll get in touch with you as soon as i come to the conclusions . 
  you 're saying it 's racist to label anglosphere countries as white ? 
  i suggest that from now on my fellow americans must only post in the megathread . 
  you 're free to believe that . 
  you think british politics are mature and stately ? 
  ed miliband 's sandwich disagrees . 
  we 're not exotic enough for you =( i do n't see what he has to complain about when [ brits are the largest demographic on this subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2i7a7f/the_reurope_user_flair_statistics_as_of_20141003/ ) , even though the uk is only the 5th most populous country in europe . 
  this sub needs more russians , that would liven up the place . 
  so what happens if you ask them about [ these guys , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s.s._sturmbrigade_r.o.n.a . ), 
  or [ these guys ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_cossack_cavalry_division ), 
  they only complain about posters from white non-european countries , i wonder why . 
  never seen anyone complain about the mexicans or japanese who post here . 
  we 're the foreigners it 's ok to drone on about . 
  the brits have been complaining about the `` americanization '' of their country since we came into existence . 
  i 've been reading jeremy black 's * history of the british isles , * and he mentions how even in the mid 19th century it was fashionable to accuse a politician you did n't like of being part of the `` americanisation '' of british politics . 
  william gladstone and joseph chamberlain were both accused of this by their critics . 
  the limeys saw our politics as vitriolic and populist , where as theirs was mature and stately . 
  how times have changed . 
  who do i root for in the next french election if i do n't want my country getting dragged into another intervention in one of your former colonies ? 
  she 'll call putin before hillary . 
  so another round with germany ?

  russian watches are pretty neat , they are n't luxury quality by any means , but they seem to be the most sought after watch of a certain nationality . 
  unlike swiss or japanese watches , the russians seem to put nationalism into their time pieces . 
  like , no one buys a rolex or a seiko because it looks thoroughly japanese or swiss . 
  but a russian watch just looks russian , probably because of the cyrillic . 
  like the famous [ strela ] ( http://www.poljot24.de/media/catalog/product/cache/2/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/t/strela125042k.jpg ) and the [ vostok amphibia .

  well people always say , `` this country was built by irish immigrants ! 11 '' hardly surprising then . 
  too soon i guess . 
  `` yep . '', 
  the argentinians have reached north korean levels of absurdity with their constant cries for attention to the falklands `` question . '', 
  you might as well entertain dialogue with best korea on possibly annexing the south . 
  and building shit balconies . 
  too soon ? 
  what dialogue is there to be had ? 
  they want to be british . 
  `` russia just nuked a non-nuclear country , better invade them and thus start a global nuclear war that will wipe out humanity . '', 
  that makes no sense at all . 
  [ mfw corbyn wants `` dialogue '' between britain and argentina on the sovereignty of the falklands . 
  the irish generally are n't known for their ability to procure foodstuffs . 
  no wonder muslims hate us then . 
  he had to eat irish food for 5 years , if that 's not torture i do n't know what is . 
  did you at least give him a ps3 to play ? 
   damache was indicted in philadelphia in 2011 along with the three others on charges of plotting to assassinate a swedish cartoonist who depicted the prophet muhammad as a dog . 
   upon his release from jail in dublin in may , his tone was strikingly different . 
   `` i always had faith in the irish legal system , '' he said in a statement issued by his lawyers . 
  `` after more than five years in jail , i am looking forward to moving on with my life here . '', 
  you can keep him , please . 
  filthy nationalists !, 
   `` it ` s just the matter of time when payments with the online currency will become as popular as using credit cards today , '' no, 
  i did n't scoff at the idea of a russia appreciation thread because i hate russia , i do n't , i scoffed at it because there would be a million eastern europeans in the thread , who do hate russia . 
  try telling them the soviet union was n't literally nazi germany , and see what happens . 
  yes , i 'm here on assignment from the cia to distribute anti-putin propaganda to yuropeans . 
  `` russia appreciation thread '' hahahahaha, 
  well good thing jeremy corbyn takes a real hardline stance on argentina and the falklands !, 
  wait ... 
  looks like someone downcorbyned you for calling the greens crazy . 
  so they 're going to steal a dozen votes from the greens and snp , and lose millions of centrist votes to the tories . 
  i 'm really struggling to see how they defeat the tories this way . 
  where did i endorse fptp ... ? 
  why would labour even want to change it ? 
  they did to the conservatives in 2005 what the conservatives just did to them . 
  the two largest parties benefit from fptp , meaning it will never change . 
  yes ? 
  how does that invalidate my previous statement ?
