  it 's not even just europeans . 
  if you look at global history then almost every country has had some history with imperialism . 
  there were even a couple of 19th-20th colonial powers outside of europe . 
  wow , i thought all 3 baltic states had a net loss of people due to emigration every year . 
  til . 
  that 's not quite correct , but it 's also not fair to judge russia for imperial ambitions either . 
  i did n't deny manifest destiny , the trail of tears , or the many native american massacres set out by the government . 
  it 's just that 95 % of the natives died from disease brought over before we even saw them . 
  let me put it this way , montana is bigger than germany when it comes to landmass but only has a population of 1 million people . 
  we have a lot less density than you guys do . 
  most of our big cities have very strict gun laws , because they are n't needed . 
  places like montana will probably need to be able to defend themselves though . 
  one thing many europeans forget is here in america we are a big country , and a decent chunk of our population lives anywhere in the hour ( s ) mark away from any police station . 
  if they live outside of a city they have to rely on the county sheriff , which is even worse . 
  in a situation like this it 's perfectly reasonable to allow guns to be owned and to have stand your ground laws . 
  does n't germany not believe in stand your group style laws ? 
  i can understand not needing weapons if your society believes police should handle these kind of things . 
  i figured it would be harder to find the numbers because of the eu 's open border policy . 
  thanks though !, 
   extremely naive or simply dishonest to compare this situation with usa i guess that 's fair , a higher percent of immigrants in the us are illegal than in germany has refugees or illegals  usa selects its immigrants yes , but we 're pretty lax with our selection compared to many eu countries , with the exceptions of within eu borders and the refugee intake that is currently happeneing . 
  i 'm not arguing that those are bad , but it 's dishonest to say that 19 % of first and second born immigrants are bad . 
   and in many cases they do have to assimilate no , they do n't . 
  try and visit any big city here in the us , or visit the southern us . 
  we just do n't care if you do n't assimilate as long as you are a legal and productive citizen . 
   not all cultures are equal or capable of coexisting . 
  this is true , and the one point i will definitely concede on . 
  even if latin americans ( primarly mexicans ) do n't assimilate , they can still live together better with average us citizen than a very fundamentalist muslim and a german . 
  the disease destroyed most the natives for us . 
  just vaccinate your kids and you will be fine . 
   they based their headline to europeans ' willing to fight map . 
  they literally said no one in europe want to fight for their country so if we start a war this morning , we can perform our prayers in the bellevue palace and we can take rome in just two days . 
  google maps says the drive from instanbul to rome is about 23 hours , so it seems like the turkish military has quite some room for improvement there . 
  19 % is n't as high as my country . 
  you can still function as a society with immigrants as long as they can get jobs . 
  i know europeans are picky about having people culturally assimilate as well , but they do n't even need to do that . 
  as long as they become productive members of society they will be fine . 
  how does 18.9 % of the population being first or second gen immigrants compare to the rest of europe . 
  i worded that poorly . 
  i just meant that they should both be prosecuted . 
  i understand it 's because he has n't been caught yet . 
  ok , makes sense . 
  i can respect that decision if it 's with the safety of the average citizen in mind . 
  yep . 
  thank god he ca n't make any real domestic decisions . 
  i think russia is manipulating quite a lot , but i ca n't imagine the refugee crisis being one of them . 
  denmark : possession is illegal for private citizens . 
  as of 2008 , police officers began to carry pepper spray as part of their standard equipment . 
  - wikipedia what is the reasoning for this ? 
  i understand her being prosecuted since she broke the law by having one ( although the man should be prosucted for trying to undress her ) but i want to know why it is illegal . 
   the 17-year-old told police she was targeted in the coastal town of sonderborg by an *** english *** - speaking man , who knocked her to the ground and tried to undress her . 
   it is unclear if the man was an asylum seeker or refugee . 
  interesting detail , so he might not even be a refugee . 
   after meeting the presidents of all three baltic states , mr pence said that the message of president donald trump to them was :  `` we are with you . '', 
   `` under president donald trump , the united states stands firmly behind our article 5 pledge of mutual defence , '' he said at a news conference in the estonian capital , tallinn . 
  also , not about the baltics , but i though this was pretty interesting  the us is currently holding its *** biggest *** ever joint military exercises with georgia , a country which fought a war with russia in 2008 and seeks to join nato . 
  it was a weird . 
  the entire article felt like him saying he disliked britain despite the fact that he feels indebted to britain , maybe that 's just an australian thing in general though . 
  ( not german but here 's my take on it ) there 's not a first world country on earth where it 's not safe to walk around in city centers at night . 
  hell , even in most third world countries you would be safe . 
  sure , there 's a couple of crime ridden areas , but those will always exist , and any refugees prone to commit crime will probably end up living in those areas that were already crime ridden before they arrived . 
  any possible concern is about a slightly less safer than usual environment , not that every person who walks outside gets killed by a terrorist attack . 
  oh well , hopefully the time where the us or europe is ever needed to defend against russia never comes . 
  if it does , i hope germany can overcome their dependence on russia gas to be able to act . 
   western germany generally dislikes russia while the eastern germans still have some strange fondness for their former imperial overlord . 
  it 's obviously not the same thing , but too be fair a lot of previous colonies are on good relations with their colonial masters . 
   american lng could be the answer of course but somehow german industrial interests seems beholden to the russian energy industry . 
  it is definitely an answer , but like i said it 's not even the only one . 
  i do n't get why germany does n't look to one of the other oil producing nations instead of russia . 
  if they want ee to back them on any major decisions in the ee they need to sooth the security concerns of the balkins and the baltics . 
  like i said , we ca n't be here forever , and i think the countries who fear for their security recognize this better than western europe does . 
  putin and the russian government is n't incredibly well liked over here either . 
  although too be fair i guess they 're not liked by the general public in germany either , they just feel some sort of stockholm syndrome over this gas situation . 
  i just hope that germany learns that it wo n't be able to play ball with places like china and russia the way it can with the western world . 
  hopefully you guys can knock some sense into them :p, 
  i 'm just so amazed at the massive russian friendship the german leaders seem to have with russia . 
  then again i guess i ca n't comment on that can i ? 
  ya , i think your biggest problem is germany 's russian gas dependency . 
  for some reason they refuse to diversify , i honestly do n't get how it has any support there unless the government either really supports it for some reason or there 's some super covert russian funded propaganda spreading in germany . 
  to any german reading this thinking i 'm saying you should buy us gas instead , you do n't have to . 
  there 's many other options out there . 
  if you all raise your defense spending you could definitely defend against russian aggression on your own , with or without the us . 
  germany just outspending russia is n't enough because russia has a lot of things that makes their military cheaper , but with france , italy and poland and the rest of the gang specializing ( like how sweden has super stealthy subs or how estonia is good with cyberwarfare ) i could see russia becoming scared of the rest of europe . 
  russia is the exception since he is russian, 
  i remember seeing this a while ago . 
  interesting that the part of the problem seems to be that the welfare gives more than a part time job , maybe it would be better to extend unemployment benefits to some style of poverty benefits instead ? 
  this guy unironically thinks that every european country is a puppet of the us . 
  he 's not kidding . 
  we do have other concerns through the world you know . 
  trump and abe seem to be gearing up for war with nk , if we actually go to war with them it 's gon na be a little hard to defend the baltics at the same time . 
  i know american doctrine is to always be able to fight two wars at the same time , but i do n't know if we could do that vs nk and russia . 
  if you want to ever feel fully secure in europe you guys need to step up your game as well . 
  we wo n't always be there . 
  we never would 've nuked the ussr and killed our entire population over finland . 
  you 're forgetting that the us was the one place that was for sure not going to survive the cold war going hot since we had at least 2 major nuclear nations aiming at us . 
  you 'd still have france raising the unemployment a lot . 
  a good example , the first image there in the top left literally leads to another reddit threat complaining about non white europeans showing up for `` european people history '', 
  liberia was an american colony rrreee edit : for whoever is downvoting me `` the republic of liberia began as a settlement of the american colonization society ( acs ) , who believed blacks would face better chances for freedom in africa than in the united states '', 
  i got a decent amount of them to show up , but not all of them . 
  did it work for you when you used bing ? 
  thanks for clarifying !,
