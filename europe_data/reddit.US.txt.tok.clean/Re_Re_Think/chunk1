there are two really exciting parts about this party to me : 1 ) . 
  they support a [ basic income ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome ) , making them perhaps the largest , most influential political party currently in existence to do so . 
  the internet , and reddit specifically , helped to organize and popularize them , through the subreddit / r/podemos ----- there 's no reason why other political movements ca n't use the internet or different kinds of [ democracy software ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome/comments/2kvesd/in_spain_we_are_the_best_candidate_oecd_country/clpf6mt ) to organize themselves . 
  i think , going forward , there 's only going to be more internet-based and digital-based political innovation , organization , and participation , because the extremely low communication cost the technology creates finally allows direct democracy to be feasible . 
  traditional political parties are going to be bludgeoned over the head with the fact that they are going to have to engage people on their terms , over the internet . 
  moving politics to digital communication structures like / r/podemos could be either good and bad . 
  there 's great opportunity for more real , unfiltered , decentralized , authority-less political participation for the typical person . 
  but there 's also opportunity for the established powers to try and bring propaganda or control of the channels of communication ( the net neutrality issue ) to the internet , like they had used traditional mass media ( tv , radio , newsprint ) modes of communication for . 
  help , i 'm stuck in an infinite loop, 
  to a healthy , un-repressed view of sex !, 
  and that would be disastrous !, 
  we need to give them no information on sex so we can better control them using the learned fear about the topic which we instilled into them . 
  but how are we supposed to know how repressive our government is against the press if it represses the press so much ? 
  oh noooooooo , we 're part of your country now , what ever will we doooooo, 
  so if nordic cross flags represent the plus sign of good , god-fearing people , does that mean flags with giant minus signs represent the antichristians ? 
  countries like estonia , netherlands , and . . oh god ... 
  germany !? 
  there 's only one conclusion : the german flag is a subliminal nationwide conspiracy . 
  one for each of their citizens , how nice !, 
  what a short raptor that fancily-dressed man is riding . 
  i bet he was only of average height for male raptors living in his time period . 
  finally !, 
  eesti has found a way to into nordic ~, 
  what , ban people who cry when criticized ? 
  but of course , as both the cause and the immediate witness , he must feel their distress most acutely !, 
  my , are n't his humors sensitive !, 
  and if such is the case , perhaps a lab is not an appropriate place for a gentleman of such delicate nerves . 
  in a globalized economy , you can not separate yourself from the rest of the world . 
  if europe and other developed regions do not take measures to address world poverty , we * ourselves * will continue to see rising fuel , food , and immigration problems . 
  this is why i support a worldwide universal basic income . 
  is it going to solve all the worlds problems ? 
  but it does an incredible number of things simultaneously , efficiently , and `` organically '' . 
  * developed countries in the past and continue to provide * some * level of aid to developing countries . 
  why not make how we provide it more efficient ? 
  it turns out that [ direct cash transfers ] ( https://www.givedirectly.org/research-on-cash-transfers.html ) have some of the best statistical evidence for their efficacy , in comparison to [ in-kind ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/in-kind ) ( goods , instead of money , pre-selected by an organizing body like a government or a charity or someone who may not be `` on the ground '' and who actually knows the needs involved best ) transfers . 
  only a couple types ( women 's healthcare , women 's education , infrastructure ) of them appear to possibly be competitive with simply giving cash . 
  * it takes advantage of differences in purchasing power between locations to help those with greatest need `` most '' . 
  there 's no large organizational system or set of rules that needs to be set up to identify `` who 's the poorest '' or `` who 's the most in need '' due to geography . 
  those who are those things , are going to be automatically helped relatively `` more '' by the same amount of cash , without uprooting them . 
  ( again , it 's not a perfect system . 
  differences in individual need , like , for example , medical conditions , are n't addressed as well . 
  but a world ubi does address geographical inequality ) * it gives people in developed countries context . 
  it helps us understand how truly little many other people in the world must live on , on a daily basis . 
  * by being a type of income `` insurance '' , it provides more stability for these regions , which will generate positive effects that indirectly help even those of us who live in relatively stable countries ( less environmental pollution , more stable oil markets from less war , etc ) . 
  * it has incredible power for social cohesion . 
  it ( or whatever supersedes it ) is an idea that can potentially unify incredibly disparate people across widely different walks of life , because finding ways to increase it over time can become a * civilization * goal . 
  it 's essentially saying `` this is how much we value life '' . 
  `` this is the absolute minimum no human begin is worth less than '' . 
  ever hear sayre 's law ? 
  `` the fight is so vicious because the stakes are so low ? '' . 
  the financial elite would convince us we have principles to follow that directly contravene our immediate best interests ( unlike them , who are completely allowed , socially , to always follow their immediate best interests ) because that 's all we have , we have no extreme control of capital the way they do . 
  whether that 's justified or not is not an issue for me . 
  i try to care more about practical outcomes ( which things like progressive taxation have ample evidence for ) than ideology . 
  it just turns out that 99.9 etc. % of people 's interests are usually better than 0.01 etc. % of people 's interests ( aka , democracy in action ) because any time you have a non-universal group of people pretending ( or not even pretending ) to curate power for the entire group , principle-agent problems arise . 
   your taxi driver wants high fares and you low etc. 
  the way to reconcile these `` differing '' interests is to see the larger context beyond which there * are * differences , much like , to use a physics analogy , how particles with `` distinct '' characteristics are unified at higher energies . 
  for this specific case , in more general terms , the taxi driver wants high income ( by which i really mean more purchasing power ... to a point ... somewhere about 100k $ / year it becomes about relative wealth , not purchasing power ) , and the taxi rider wants low service costs . 
  they could both be accomplished by a combination of society-level changes that benefit both parties because they are more efficient . 
  like , for example , progressive taxation ( which does not reorder relative wealth ) and public transportation systems ( which are currently more efficient than decentralized ones ) fulfill the goals of both at lower cost to both , but only if they can recognize the larger context within which their `` disagreement '' disappears . 
  then what you need to realize is that you are n't living under a well-functioning democracy , that it is flawed or deficient in some way . 
  what is the source of that flaw or deficiency ? 
  how can it be fixed ? 
  it should be very disturbing to you that your initial reaction after realizing that the system you live in does not adequately represent the vast majority of peoples ' interests is to immediately , automatically assume that we live in a democracy despite it not always following the will of the typical person . 
  realize that that 's a contradiction . 
  the first step is realizing that some things you 've assumed `` are what they are '' actually `` are n't what they are '' . 
  realize that what exists is n't the theoretically envisioned version . 
  that is to say , the `` real , existing governing apparatuses we have '' * are n't * `` democracy '' . 
  so the question becomes `` how do we * make * it democracy ? '', 
  `` how do we * make * it so that we get results every citizen would want ? '', 
  for answers , begin to think about , talk about , and read about ideas people have for what is wrong with our current system of governance , economics , and society more deeply . 
  it 's never going to be done . 
  as long as there is incentive for politicians , corporations , ceos , and the wealthy to support laws like this , they will continue to appear over and over and over . 
  you 'll have to whip up public attention over and over and over until the public does n't or ca n't `` care '' anymore about the issue , and then they 're pass this freedom-of-information-throttling atrocity , under a different name and quietly . 
  no matter how much the public would benefit from net neutrality , a tiered internet ( is just one example of something that ) benefits the rich and politically powerful . 
  therefore , it will always be a clandestine push in the background to try and make it come to pass . 
  if you think i 'm exaggerating , there has been a veritable alphabet soup of acronym strings here in the us trying to pass these types of laws ( and inspiring versions elsewhere in the world ) , and they just keep coming . 
  google : sopa , pipa , acta , etc. 
  ----- you have to change your system of politics and economics so that the few can not profit at the expense of the many so easily ( we both do , actually ) . 
  that is how you * fundamentally * resolve countless other issues of the common good like the net neutrality . 
  the underlying system of capitalist incentivization needs to change . 
   the slim usa lists is not an indication that usa is politically more uniform , rather it is an alarming indicator that the election system does n't much work since many parties do n't see it meaningful to even show up in it . 
  hit the nail on the head . 
  and they will be in government , because your country elects representatives proportionately , rather than through single winner , winner-takes-all allocation . 
  it 's worth chasing even a couple percentage points of support , because you will get representation reflecting those voters . 
  it 's a completely different way from the us , where we have winner-take-all , single seat elections . 
  it 's not like there could n't be a long list of choices here in the us . 
  there could be . 
  but that 's not the reason why it does n't happen . 
  the reason why we do n't get long lists of choices is that our [ voting system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_system ) only makes basically 2 choices ** viable ** , so not many other political parties besides the two major ones even try to run in the first place . 
  that 's why they appear short : because in practice only 2 will almost always get any payoff ( any power in government ) from running in the first place . 
  two or ten choices vs. a couple dozen or more choices does n't happen `` just because '' , or because dutch democracy is better than american democracy for some unexplained reason but-we-won ` t-say-why . 
  there is a real reason why you do n't get that many realistic choices in america , and it does n't matter whether it 's 2 or 10 . 
  the reason why we have such limited choices is because of the [ voting system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_system ) we use for our elections called [ first past the post ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-past-the-post_voting ) ( also called `` plurality '' ) , to count votes once they 're made . 
  first past the post suffers from something called the [ spoiler effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spoiler_effect ) , which mathematically incentives a degeneration to a 2 party system over time ( over repeated elections ) , even if the political landscape starts out with more than two parties , or tries to introduce new `` third '' parties . 
  in the end , it does n't matter if there are 3 , or 4 , or 10 choices , because after repeated elections , there will be a tendency for only 2 ( which tend to absorb all other third party alternatives , over time ) to be viable . 
  so even if you introduced more parties into american politics ( which happens all the time ) , until the underlying voting system changes , they likely wo n't have much success ( unless , in a rare case , a major party becomes so unpopular it completely collapses , and is replaced by a new party that takes its place in the 2-party system ) . 
  the netherlands ( and many european countries ) does not suffer from this , because they do not use first past the post . 
  the netherlands uses a multi-party , proportional representation system . 
  -------- it does n't matter if you say to the american electorate `` here , you do have more than 2 choices ! '', 
  if you leave out the part where american elections are winner-take-all ( as opposed to many european election systems that are proportional in various ways ) , and voting for any choice besides the 2 most popular options ( unless that party completely replaces one of the 2 ) has almost essentially no outcome on the election .
