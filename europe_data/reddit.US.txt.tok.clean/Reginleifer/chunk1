you 'd think that rooskie ivan would have learned from the cold war about trying to 1-1 match us investments . 
  they 're more than welcome to try again though . 
   get your mind out of the history , the principle of the heritage-guilt belongs in the bible-lessons and not in modern politics . 
  i was actually referring to another bible lesson mein friend . 
  and we in the current year can still learn much from it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parable_of_the_unforgiving_servant  then peter came and said to him , `` lord , how often shall my brother sin against me , and i forgive him ? 
  until seven times ? '', 
   jesus said to him , `` i do n't tell you until seven times , but , until seventy times seven . 
  therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king , who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants . 
  when he had begun to reconcile , one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents . 
  but because he could n't pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , with his wife , his children , and all that he had , and payment to be made . 
  the servant therefore fell down and knelt before him , saying , ` lord , have patience with me , and i will repay you all ! ', 
  the lord of that servant , being moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt . 
   `` but that servant went out , and found one of his fellow servants , who owed him one hundred denarii , and he grabbed him , and took him by the throat , saying , ` pay me what you owe ! ', 
  `` so his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him , saying , ` have patience with me , and i will repay you ! ', 
  he would not , but went and cast him into prison , until he should pay back that which was due . 
  so when his fellow servants saw what was done , they were exceedingly sorry , and came and told to their lord all that was done . 
  then his lord called him in , and said to him , ` you wicked servant !, 
  i forgave you all that debt , because you begged me . 
  should n't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant , even as i had mercy on you ? ', 
  his lord was angry , and delivered him to the tormentors , until he should pay all that was due to him . 
  so my heavenly father will also do to you , if you do n't each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds . '', 
   the time that german 's bend over by the mentioning of nazi 's is gone for a while now . 
  nobody is asking you to kiss our ass or pay what you owe ( which your country could n't even possibly begin to do ) , what is being brought up here is that if germany were to have paid in full the complete damage they did to europe , there would be no germany to be lecturing people about debt paying , i 'd be arguing with a half mongloid , if anyone at all . 
  heritage blaming has nothing to do with the fact that you ca n't cross a bridge and then set fire to it without looking like a massive hypocrite . 
  luckily for your people there was some in the victor side that realized that maybe getting the full pound of flesh was n't the best idea , that maybe it would be better for all involved to not completely buttfuck those who would not only cost us money , but lives as well . 
  it 's not unfair to ask why the recipients of that mercy can turn around and be so nasty to others . 
   and i think they were n't punished enough i know another nation that was n't punished enough . 
  and unlike them the greeks did n't set half the world on fire . 
  do n't start going into what people deserve . 
   when that did n't work as they planed they called germany as undermining their democratic vote by not giving another deal . 
  by forcing the rejected deal through , we get it , the greek government ( people really ) is scum , but the german government is the enemy of european democracy . 
   you mean by not letting the greece government fail ? 
  do n't make it sound so noble , germany 's main goal was asset recovery . 
  they `` dealed '' behind the greek 's back to ensure they would get their pound of flesh , nothing more . 
   greece said `` we do n't want your deal , we voted now , so give us a better one '' that 's their fuckup , ignoring their desire not to take this deal was yours . 
   no , if greece denies to take the deal , they will not get further money , because the german democratic right is to refuse to give money as long as greece does not accept the deal . 
  which would have been the proper thing to do , germany should have left them . 
  but germany did n't do that , and chose to undermine democracy instead . 
   as if wilders and his ilk would n't kick and scream over helping muslim women and children maybe , maybe not but i believe we as a population would be willing to extend a hand more in that case . 
  less crime , less indoctrination of our own youth , bring our population up , bring the islamist syrian population down , remove the primary victims of such a regressive culture . 
  it 's a much easier pill to swallow than importing the folks behind taharush gamea . 
  people who care for others do not undermine their democracy . 
  the greek people voted to reject the germanic deal ( a better deal than they deserve , but one they rejected ) and you guys went ahead and forced the deal behind their back anyways . 
  merkel and obama then proceeded to threaten britain 's entire economy to influence people 's votes . 
  these are not the acts of friends . 
  these are the acts of a germany who bullies others and plays the victim while doing so . 
   after the war is over , they get sent home . 
  and how does your country plan on making that happen ? 
  oh yes , now germany cares for greece . 
  sure wish the germans applied that pragmatism when it came to greece 's debts . 
  you people just want your own migrants spread , it 's the only reason why greece is even mentioned . 
   at least they learned their lesson far quicker than the eu seems to . 
  people who reference the united states seem to quickly forget that the us overrepresented smaller states by a whole lot , had a shared origin in migration and even then still managed to devolve into civil war . 
  in my country california gives money to small states that does whatever they want , germany gives money to countries , and then threatens to pull that money whenever they do anything germany does n't want . 
  in my country california does n't have the authority to singlehandedly invite muslim military aged males and then demand others pay for their fuck up . 
  that would get any party to that union real tired of that union real quick . 
  you ca n't just slap a union sticker on what is essentially the fourth reich . 
  and you ca n't just point out the articles of confederation 's dismissal as an excuse for more centralized power when the replacement was completely different than anything the merkel bootlickers want . 
  pretty weak attack imo , just because he 's involuntarily part of a system ( eu ) does n't make him a hypocrite for taking part of the benefits which he is entitled to . 
  is he voting himself these perks ? 
  are the other two meps ? 
  what do these two meps have to do with farage anyways ? 
  this argument is almost as stupid as `` hey i know you 're against pensions , and since you 're against them you should n't draw yours even if we made you put money in it '' . 
  farage ( as a british subject ) is in the eu , nothing he does short of pulling brexit off is going to change that . 
  guess what he is trying to do ? 
  he 's hoping to end his own gravy train , along with his peers . 
  also 15 thousand pounds ? 
  for bodyguard expenses ... does anyone here begrudge him protection ? 
  yeah we supported a lot of jerkwads in the global fight against communism . 
  turkey was one of em . 
  now we have a huge fucking islamist flea to deal with . 
  not really , shit happened on the secularists watch . 
  ataturk gave them one job . 
   realize they are actually the majority , and are being taken in a direction only a tiny minority truly wants . 
  not necessarily ... some people identify with extremists even if they do n't share their viewpoints ( muslims and radical islam ) i do n't expect you to know american history , but plenty of american social policy changes were spearheaded by extremists , the rest were as you said `` taken in that direction '' . 
  labor rights - socialists feminists - radical feminists . 
  black rights - radical afro organizations , abolitionists ( only 10 % of the american population ) independence - ( patriots ) throughout most american history at least , the people tend to be moderates who wish for slow social change if any ... it 's always been extremists who have changed the public mood using propaganda in the form of books , newspapers and other media . 
  extremism pays off . 
  timid liberals and establishment conservatives will tell you otherwise , but it really does . 
  we 're both in an ice cream shop and you want vanilla , i want chocolate . 
  but i 'm willing to burn down the ice cream store if i do n't get what i want . 
  you realize that maybe chocolate is n't such a bad flavor in exchange for still having an ice cream store to go to . 
  a very biased , yet funny joke about this . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aeuihboudu extreme political positions are popping up in my opinion because established politicians just were n't doing what people want . 
  so in order to get their desire , they just kept voting in that direction more and more . 
  extremism paid off for the tea party gop ( usa ) , they managed to keep their politicians pretty damned obedient to the rule of `` no new taxes '' . 
  the alt-right is hoping to accomplish something like that with trump . 
   crazy dictator . 
  he 's not a dictator , and it just serves to confuse the issue . 
  he has the support of turks ... he was voted in by turks . 
  he 's crazy , but so is his country of 80 million . 
  we 're going to need to deal with that somewhere down the road . 
  as much as i 'd like to feign sympathy for the turks , sleep with the islamist dog , you wake up with islamist fleas . 
  ** edit : ** since the turkish brigade is here , i 'll be frank and say this . 
  ideas are much harder to kill than armenians . 
  you 're still a country to me . 
  edit : spain plox . 
  europe was more than capable of solving that problem individually by supporting stabilization efforts in syria or financial aid to border states , nobody wanted to fork the cash , nobody wanted to help greece , you do n't need to have a `` system '' ( giving greek/italian / sovereignty away to a foreign border control ) to solve that ... merkel 's bootlickers wanted a system in order to act . 
   there is nothing intrinsically bad about regulation , the problems arise when you either put in place ** unnecessary barriers ** problem is few europeans thinks they are unreasonable , no regulation is unnecessary ... they stand by their ridiculous regulations , they support the fragmentation of the internet .
