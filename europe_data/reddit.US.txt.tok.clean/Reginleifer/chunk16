  oh i know how to farm karma , i know what is and is n't cool to say in / r/europe as well . 
  this is n't about that . 
  this is about stating in blunt terms what the eu bootlickers dance around all day with their explanations for the eu 's treatment of those around them , but specifically greece , britain and google . 
  they do what they do to them , because they can . 
  they wo n't do that to us , because they can not . 
  i just want to rub a little lemon juice in their wounds . 
   will they take this to heart the next time they are pontificating about `` making an example out of britain '' ? 
  nah , but still it brings one a certain amount of joy to make bullies realize their own limitations . 
  the eu is n't a country . 
  no matter how badly the enemies of self determination want it to be . 
  our security is dogshit , i would n't be surprised if that were the case . 
  as they should n't , the eu is our bitch . 
  ~ ~ i do n't actually agree with this sentiment , but the pro-eu bootlickers do whenever they 're talking about anything the eu wants to harass , bully or regulate whether it be tech companies or smaller countries ~ ~ ~ ~ is might , really right ? ~ ~ edit : by the way , for anyone who wants to know about the situation in the us/eu ... the visa waiver * program is a program that has minimum requirements for entry , the us has most of europe in it , but certain countries have not met the requirements . 
  enter the eu , who lately has been taking this stance of all or nothing . 
  eu wants to negotiate as an entity with all nations ... naturally they want to deny visa free access to any country who wo n't give them reciprocity as well . 
  the us on the other hand refuses to lower its standards on safety and identification . 
  so both sides are kinda at a stalemate due to their inflexibility ( or convictions depending on your bias ), 
  which is a response to actual eu mission creep , and potential for abuse . 
   the usa meddling in other countries ' internal affairs is what has gotten everyone into that mess . 
  why stop there ? 
  why not blame european colonialism , economic exploitation and the literally hitler behavior of europeans when the natives resisted , who then proceeded to fuck off with some badly drawn borders ? 
  but obvious whatabboutism aside , what 's the plan for keeping this islamist theocrat from fucking shit up that does n't involve securing the eu borders and keeping what 's there there ? 
  got a better idea buddy ? 
  well that 's the kind of savages the soldiers tried saving the rest of the country from ... it goes without saying this is their fate now that they have failed . 
  we need to contain this madness right now . 
  will of the people or not political islam is a cancer , it is not to be reasoned with or befriended . 
   they will not ofc declare war on us , but leaving nato is a possibility . 
  if he does , i hope we begin to take a much more active pro-greek stance . 
  genocidal sharia loving bastards can go eff themselves . 
  i wan na see him try it . 
  we 'll send you even further back into the stone age , savage . 
  someone needed to do it . 
  how was that bad ? 
  no more muslim brotherhood !, 
  i distinctly remember a loudmouth lout taking credit for the liberation of france . 
  and the proceeding to shit all over the people who actually did the work . 
  edit : but since you * insist * on bringing up the resistance , why not bring up the even larger collaboration ? 
  i must have imagined that surrender then . 
  britain did fight when disaster struck , unlike france . 
  papal state vs homoempire get hype !, 
  most people advocating for using the brain , seem more inclined to fix things with their throat i 've found . 
  no , having a socialist president does n't make france any different from america . 
  the eurocrats are n't more bound to the people they represent and neither are the british conservatives . 
  it 's a problem everywhere , just specifically mentioning france . 
  the me wars were lost due to european weakness and lack of will . 
  imagine you and your buddy having to push a wrecked bus , while an entire bus of fatasses and effeminates sit there and complain . 
  if everyone pushes , if everyone gives resources and most importantly if everyone starts realizing that war is hell and sometimes mistakes get made , then we can stabilize the region . 
  but nobody wants to do that , rather spam hashtags instead . 
  the politicians who will not respond , who refuse to say the names , who plead for the community who protects these terrorists during these times are just as clueless as marie antoinette was . 
  they 're shielded . 
  they 're sheltered , they need to be brought down to our level . 
  nah , swedebro , we ai n't girls . 
  sympathy without advice or help is the worst possible thing in this situation . 
  stress is your body 's way of telling you something is wrong , so you need to fix it ... not dull the pain with hashtags . 
  there 's some comparisons we can make with the past . 
  marie antoinette , while never having said `` let them eat cake '' , lived her life as a testament to that saying . 
  hollande , shortly before this tragedy was found having an 11 thousand dollar hairdresser . 
  the parallels here are undeniable , our masters are removed from the reality on the ground . 
  how can they who enjoys feasts truly understand * hunger * ? 
  how can they with a security detail , multi million personal defense systems understand * fear * ? 
  but that is where the comparisons end . 
  the brave french of the years past did not choose to lay down and allow this misery to engulf them , they stood up , they fought and they defeated soldiers , liberating the bastille . 
  in the following struggle they made it clear to their masters that they were mistaken if they thought they could remain `` above it all '' . 
  today 's french , who knows ? 
  but i 'm not betting any money on them . 
  i got over it . 
  ignorant people are going to believe it either ways . 
  attack in nice , france ? 
  when did france become nice ? 
  unless conflict resolution is a problem in itself . 
  anyone who thinks that this army wo n't be used against europeans is a fool . 
   the money might stay in the system but redistributed amongst those running via high wages and extra expenses . 
  as an american i have to say i feel for anybody who feels this . 
  it happens here as the general rule . 
  that being said ... .  if people were already willing to spend fortunes on a reputed superior education then why would a college spend a penny more than it needed to . 
  the policy i ** believe ** you 're pointing to is referred `` starving the beast '' and is a popular belief in the right in my country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/starve_the_beast honestly i ca n't say i approve of it , and in theory high salaries for administrators could be justified . 
  some people really do earn their salaries and we want them serving the public . 
  but most of them do n't . 
   can only stay in the country for four months after completing their degree ( instead of the original two years ) and have to jump through more demeaning and unnecessary administrative hoops and visa check-ups . 
  not to be seen to be half-hearted , however , the home secretary went a step further . 
  this however , is a mistake . 
  although the conservative party is n't known for their bright ideas , just being opposed to the shittiest idea in a century . 
   this stemmed from the revelation by a 2014 bbc panorama investigation that found that the ets firm was fraudulently passing students in one local area - yet the show 's investigators themselves said that this did n't prove the practice was widespread i was about to list my only concern , that of fraudulent visa farms . 
  but this article gets me . 
  i do n't know how widespread this is , but i find it sad people are trying to abuse such a good idea . 
   yet it is not just government policy unfairly treating international students - our universities have been keen to get in on the act too . 
  they charge international students many times more what domestic students pay ** ( with little to no justification ) ** , and are quite happy to raise tuition fees mid-year , with little or no prior warning , whilst simultaneously failing to provide adequate support services for international students , ** despite owing much of their financial stability to them ** . 
  it should come as no surprise to learn then , that foreign student places in 2014 declined for the first time in 30 years . 
  that 's kind of the point of foreigners using our educational system ... instead of taking a seat , they can contribute funds so that more native sons can get educated . 
  natives presumably have been paying into the system via taxes , they 're presumably going to stay in the system ( assuming the other aspects of the state/nation are n't completely fucked up , i 'm looking at you california ) . 
  why the hell should we offer international students the same price ? 
  it 's terrible school budgeting . 
  and it 's not some insult to foreigners ( especially those of the communist variety ) , people from out of the state get charged more too . 
  in california it is simple , you become a californian or you pay so that californians can study . 
  and with the greatest ( although not * great * ) educational accessibility of all 50 states there 's no reason to change a working model . 
  add in people who voted remain because they bowed to the economic threats by merkel + obama , along with people who truly feared britain could not `` go it alone '' , and you have a much less impressive eu `` support '' group , while virtually all `` leave '' voters could be said to not support the eu . 
  clearly not the brits . 
  we 'll let you germans worry about the rebuilding . 
  you guys like taking in the jihadists right ?
