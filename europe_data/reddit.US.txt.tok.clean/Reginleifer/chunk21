  they do n't yield to strongly worded letters either , if nato wants ukraine , they 're going to have to straight up threaten nuclear war for it . 
  russians are n't like europeans , they respect only power and are completely willing to fight a conflict of attrition if there 's a sliver of a chance they can come out on top . 
  the us is not willing to fight for ukraine , and europe is even less willing to fight for it . 
  so they have nothing to fear . 
  eventually us or europe is going to need russia for some purpose , and poof , no more sanctions . 
  example , turkey 's occupation of eu territory . 
  nothing came of it , and now the eu has pressured cyrpus to make like the frozen movie and let it go . 
  seriously , i 'm tired of the sultan and his horde . 
  a recession is a small price to pay . 
  well points for honesty . 
  i dunno about you guys , but yeah there 's bots that automatically buy stock when the price decreases past a certain point based on the assumption that stock prices will eventually go up . 
  http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2012/11/07/wall-street-election-react/1687277/ also \\  relying on investor feels you guys know the market plummets every time a new york banker wakes up hung over right ? 
  xd investors do n't like change period , it does n't mean britain is going to die ... just that they 're uncertain . 
  hell even nigel is uncertain . 
  you guys going to throw away your sovereign rights over a bit of uncertainty ? 
  nigel `` kebab out of leeds lest we become swedes '' farage . 
  ; / now imagine if everyone thought like that . 
   there is a perfect time and a place for everyone . 
  telling junker to go fuck himself after threatening the country for its democratic choice would be it for boris . 
  i 'd vote for him , and i ai n't even a brit . 
   ` making the world safe for democracy ' is gone europeans do n't give two shits about democracy , they fought hitler because hitler was a threat and some ( which i wo n't point fingers , suffice to say they spoke french ) did n't even do that . 
  usa ? 
  americans ( outside of the elite ) had no love for britain , they did n't want to get involved in that fight until japan attacked first ... then the effort focused on europe , confusing the hell out of americans . 
  the `` world safe for democracy '' argument was made of course , but there were other more compelling reasons why people aligned with us war goals . 
   during this same period , the u.s. government began to mobilize for total war , instituting the first-ever peacetime draft and a fivefold increase in the defense budget ( from $ 2 billion to $ 10 billion ) . 
  [ 6 ] in the meantime , as the british began running short of money , arms , and other supplies , prime minister winston churchill pressed president franklin d. roosevelt for american help . 
  sympathetic to the british plight but hampered by public opinion and the neutrality acts , which forbade arms sales on credit or the loaning of money to belligerent nations , roosevelt eventually came up with the idea of `` lend-lease '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lend-lease#historical_background lend lease was basically a way to help europe without the pesky political backlash of war . 
  because most americans thought it was `` europe 's war '' . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_security_co-ordination british infiltration and propaganda dissemination during ww2 , made its way into the homes of americans by presenting propaganda as fact . 
   the fictional stories disseminated from rockefeller center would then be legitimately picked up by other radio stations and newspapers , before being relayed to the american public . 
  [ 1 ] through this , anti-german stories were placed in major american media outlets to turn public opinion, 
  same product , different packaging . 
   the enemy of my enemy after all . 
  europeans do n't seem to realize this . 
  to the right wingers , an omnipotent/omniscient supergovernment is a much larger and present threat than an corrupt and frankly crippled neighbor . 
  i 'd take russian money in a heartbeat as well if i had to put myself in their shoes . 
  local control = crazy people take over some parts of the country . 
  most authority on most matters goes to the individual states of the united states , but when it comes to education , the largest share of the `` power '' is split at the state and local level . 
   i heard that this is taught as an alternative to evolutionism on biology classes there . 
  see , unlike poland , germany , or really any eu country , the `` man '' ( by which i mean elites ) do n't really have a say in the entire country . 
  `` intelligent design '' is really only a problem in certain states and certain districts . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/creation_and_evolution_in_public_education_in_the_united_states#development_by_state the entire thing is way more complicated than just `` americans teach creationism '' . 
  and a part of the problem in the us ** sometimes involves the market as well as government ** http://www.nea.org/home/39060.htm  the standards will guide textbook purchases and classroom instruction over the next decade -- and maybe not just in texas . 
  national publishers usually cater to its demands because the school board is probably the most influential in the country . 
  texas buys 48 million textbooks every year . 
  no other state , except california , wields that sort of market clout . 
  eli5 : texas board of education ( and by extension all texans ) is retarded , but texas is big , so what texas votes for in their books generally gets put into other state textbooks because texas is big , and other states are not so they cater to texas . 
  california on the other hand is also big , so california gets to choose their own textbooks , marked as the `` california edition '' . 
  edit : behold , glorious texbook of california , free from special interests and stupid hats : https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=oip.maa246609287b87e5778c3b51021a17e9o0&amp;pid=15.1 edit : texan textbooks , made for inbreds by inbreds .

   thank god that people in europe have moral standards . 
  which is why anti-eu sentiments are so low right now right ? 
  because people love being the victims of rape , terrorism and extremism right ? 
   deport all of them , even those who did n't do anything wrong ? 
  they can continue to do nothing wrong in turkey , where it is safe for them . 
  it all makes sense now . 
  \\  we need nato . 
  you guys need nato , we 're fine . 
  also should anyone have the balls to attack hawaii , i do n't see britain sending boaty mcboatface our way . 
  nato 's always been a one sided agreement and i do n't want to add your sheep and oil outpost to american obligations . 
  why does n't spain take over portugal ? 
  did n't the poles help the ukranians out the most out of all the eu countries ? 
  interesting how they seem to insult them . 
  being brave is knowing you 're fucked and fighting anyways . 
  the polish are brave imo because of this . 
  british colonial interests are none of our concern . 
  i think you 're getting ahead of yourself . 
  burn the savages , strike fear into their hearts using shock and awe ... then foreign aid . 
  foreign aid dependent on an occupation ... cause that happened to both germany and japan . 
  you think the nazis and the japanese imperialists just gave up because they were paid off ? 
  every separation has its price . 
  the united states fought two wars with foreign powers ( the french and the barbary pirates ) after losing the protection of the royal navy . 
  navies were built , money was spent and men died . 
  it 's the price of freedom , the price of being able to wake up in the morning not having to be told what to do by some louts across a body of water . 
  every country in this side of the world paid a much higher price than `` one year of economic expansion '' , and the idea that britain would balk at securing their sovereignty because of it , is laughable . 
   `` if ye love wealth better than liberty , the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom , go home from us in peace . 
  we ask not your counsels or your arms . 
  crouch down and lick the hands which feed you . 
  may your chains set lightly upon you , and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen . '', 
  ~ samuel adams, 
   proper response would need to be on the eu level . 
  if nations were capable of operating on an eu level , there 'd be no far right resurgence . 
  moving the decision making control even further from where `` the people '' is counter productive to a responsive and quick government . 
  well ... yeah . 
  i really do n't care for nationalists party platforms besides not giving away sovereignty/not letting * muslim * men in . 
  i do n't expect leftists to care about borders either . 
  i expect them to react to what people want though . 
  i expect them to put aside certain goals in order to reach others ... what is insulting to me and to certain europeans is that lefty/moderate right parties decided this was the hill they wanted to die on . 
  they chose to risk their political clout on something nobody else wanted thinking that they were the only players in the game , they gambled and they lost . 
  now they blame the far right for `` pandering '' , no their position was quite clear from the start ... the left forced people into the far right . 
  hehe , this is why `` strongmen '' will always dominate weaker leaders . 
  what you guys `` consider '' and ultimately turn on people for saying out loud is what these guys do and benefit . 
  i think poland , austrians , and certain canadians have gone on record saying they 'd chose certain types of people ( women , children , christians , ukranians ) and those efforts ultimately came to nothing . 
  well edrogan did choose the most desirable refugees . 
  this does not go unnoticed by either europeans , or americans . 
  they desire strong leaders because they honestly do get better results , they obtain better deals ( eu rapid track for turkey , better migrants ) . 
  personally i hate edrogan , but can see why people would vote for someone like him . 
  the rise of strongmen is the fault of left , and the left alone for being such bad stewards of their people . 
   interfaith marriage . 
  i do n't bloody think sharia allows it m8 .
