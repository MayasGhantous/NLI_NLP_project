  here 's a tip , if kebab ships give trouble , remove kebab ships . 
   so germany is the one country that does n't get to focus on its own self interest ? 
  germoney is the one advocating for a massive supergovernment that removes self-determination from individual nations ... germoney is not a victim and does n't get to behave in a manner that willfully punishes those nations , and leaves them to the dogs . 
  why even give up autonomy if the main country pushing it is abandoning nations right now ? 
  i mean you could leave greece to drown , you could invade poland , you could do plenty of things ... but none of them prove the german model of absolute obedience to a foreign supergovernment is the right thing . 
  on the other hand orban 's people do n't want to give up sovereignty and do n't want rape , fugee quotas ... he 's giving people what he wants . 
  he 's proving his views on politics deliver results . 
   orban said that hungary would n't participate in any resettlement plan and that `` nothing should be done without the closing of the borders . ''  he also said that ukrainians should be given eu visas exemptions before any similar deal with turkey , which is being offered billions of euros ( dollars ) in refugee aid , fast-track eu membership and an easing of visa rules to win its support for efforts to stem the migrant flow . 
  orban is a god damned hero !, 
  and what the hell ? 
  first the uk helps saudi arabia with the hrc , and now they want to fast track this ? 
   turkish authorities stormed the headquarters of the zaman newspaper to enforce a court decision to place it and its sister outlets under the management of trustees . 
  the move sparked two days of protests which police dispersed using tear gas and water cannons . 
  into the eu ? 
  has the situation devolved so much that europe is willing to deal with the fucking sultan ? 
  i do n't think you understand the concept of a federation that is n't soviet style . 
  germoney does n't get to play self-interest in this game , the entire argument for giving berlin expanded powers is that `` europe will work better '' . 
  if you guys leave greece to drown then everyone is going to see that the eu superstate plan is nothing more than a power grab . 
  orban on the other hand got a good result with his anti-eu minded ploy , his country does n't have to care for migrants who would go to germoney , and the rest of the rich , effeminate , bossy nations . 
  play his game and you 're just proving the superiority of the euskeptics . 
  and then you have a bunch of guys voting in euroskeptics because `` fuck it those guys get shit done '' . 
   a benefit-only union does n't really work . 
  haha , funny coming from the pro-germany side who left greece to rot . 
  hungary is only doing what 's in their best interest , just like the major powers of europe did . 
  but now is the time to cooperate huh ? 
  how is this bottom comment ? 
  this is exactly the route europe needs to follow , it 's the path the us followed ( and god knows / r/europe uses us as the justification for their supergovernment monstrosity ) , it 's not easy , you do n't develop an identity overnight . 
  and you sure as hell do n't develop it if the leader of your union is a fucking deutschbag who thinks money must compel absolute obedience . 
  not contradiction . 
  nobody is pushing punishment ... germany got away with it , whatever . 
  however the attitude that germany takes with other nations when they themselves were in that position is fair game for criticism . 
  if a debt is forgiven , or even partially forgiven ... and then you go around shaking people down over pennies , people are going to rightfully think you 're a shitty person . 
  no , but you 'd think that after ** getting off ** from that fuck up , they 'd be a little more understanding of other nations in debt , and they 'd certainly be able to understand the concept of a nation not being able to operate under excessive burden . 
  but no , they 've learned nothing . 
  no merely the equivalent amount of suffering and death they caused upon others with the war they caused . 
  that 's what they `` deserve '' , but not what they got . 
  until then it is indisputable that they got off `` light '' . 
  they deserved much much worse . 
  so i do n't get your point . 
  deindustrialization was mainly a tool of ensuring that the germans could never again have the * capacity * to wage another war of aggression . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morgenthau_plan#churchill.27s_support_for_the_plan  churchill was not inclined to support the proposal , saying `` england would be chained to a dead body . '', 
  roosevelt reminded churchill of stalin 's comments at the tehran conference , and asked `` are you going to let germany produce modern metal furniture ? 
  the manufacture of metal furniture can be quickly turned in the manufacture of armament . 
  '' [ 28 ] the meeting broke up on churchill 's disagreement but roosevelt suggested that morgenthau and white continue to discuss with lord cherwell , churchill 's personal assistant . 
  the marshall plan was created ( and extended to west germany ) because w. germany was holding back the recovery of the other european nations . 
  pragmatic , simple . 
  no `` fuck germany forever '' sentiment , something germany should appreciate since the greeks have n't done nearly as bad to them as they 've done to the world . 
  although if you do want to hear that sentiment  secretary of the treasury henry j. morgenthau jr. convinced roosevelt to write to secretary of state cordell hull and secretary of war henry l. stimson saying that a us occupation policy which anticipated that `` germany is to be restored just as much as the netherlands or belgium '' was excessively lenient . 
  a better policy would have the germans `` fed three times a day with soup from army soup kitchens '' so `` they will remember that experience the rest of their lives . 
  eventually practicality won out , germany was n't excessively punished because there was no way germany could pay for the whole extent of the damage they did , and to do so would hurt everyone 's interests . 
   he added that voters faced `` undoubtedly a tough choice '' . 
   one option was staying in an `` essentially unreformed eu '' , with the other being the uncertainty of leaving . 
   he said the very best place for the uk to be was in a reformed eu , but added : `` i have come to the conclusion that the eu is incapable of meaningful reform , at least in the foreseeable future . '', 
  he 's not wrong . 
  it 's ridiculous because the logical thing to do is to help the greeks , just as it was to help the germans when they burned europe to the ground . 
  germany is the walking definition of the '' [ unforgiving servant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parable_of_the_unforgiving_servant ) , that they ride greece so hard irks me to no end . 
  the willful ignoring of the greek referendum was some soviet tier fuckery as well . 
  yes the greeks fucked up , they do n't deserve aid ... but if people got what they `` deserved '' , what would have happened to germany ? 
   more than ** most ** others , its voice within the european union is essential and critical to the united states . '' i think that 's the important part there , the limeys are no longer able to serve as the `` gateway to europe '' , so even if they stay in as a `` favor '' to us they are only sealing their own fate inside the rotting juggernaut that is the eu . 
  what happens to non-useful countries ? 
  they 're ignored . 
  britain is fucked either way , but there 's a chance to bounce back in a new capacity outside the german dominated eu . 
  it 's the `` financial abortion '' , not an actual abortion but that 's what they 're calling it in the us . 
   yes and like not all germans were nazis . 
  i feel bound to point out that while not all germans were members of the nazi party there was very little opposition to the fuhrer , he was a well liked guy . 
  as for the atrocities ... it 's pretty obvious with what we know now that the germans knew what was going on , not only do soldiers have families , but the smell of the sickly and dead would not have escaped the german nose . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/feb/17/johnezard https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denazification the american allied forces took that into consideration when they took the germans inside the camps , forcing them to confront the great evils they had committed . 
   tbh it seems like germans are attempting to impose an alien order on things so basically nothing has changed ? 
  we 'd probably be better off being champions of national sovereignty , the people who support that are much more receptive to american policy anyways . 
  besides the poles are n't fucking with individual rights nearly to the level that germany is , they have social media sites censoring shit for them now . 
  the polish government is staunchly anti-russian , they 're prepared to meet the security commitments needed to fight for eastern europe ... 
  the germans and french have always steered their countries on the path of pointless bitching and third way politics . 
  the us benefits by standing by their friends . 
  there 's a difference between discreetly nudging someone and whatever the hell the us government has been doing with our european partners . 
  even the british queen had more sense than to opine on an internal referendum , and that 's `` her '' country . 
  why are we making positions clear with countries we 're not hostile with ? 
  especially a country who barely elected their new government ? 
  why is the us getting involved in internal european affairs ? 
  and on the wrong side ? 
  same shit with the british referendum . 
  we 're fucking over the people who would be on our side when shit hits the fan , for who ? 
  parisans and berliners ? 
  those people are going to hate the us no matter what we do , do n't suck up to them . 
  oh i 'm sorry , i did n't realize stopping the spread of russian communism ( which fucked up the countries under their domain way worse than any coup ever could ) and avoiding an invasion that would have cost over 1 million american lives was comparable in any way to shooting chinese peasants and indian subjects for the sake of empire . 
  but hey keep trying for that high ground . 
  the french were clearly the better colonial force in canada , they pretty much just wanted furs and shit , that did n't require displacing natives and they 'd often even trade with them . 
  the spanish were cruel ( slave labor in practice if not in name ) , but they had the benefit of putting indigenous peoples under their domain instead of punting them into progressively tighter and less rich lands . 
  now a lot of people trace at least part of their descent to native blood , whereas the british originated us and canada have them greatly diminished , drinking firewater , slowly dying . 
  so it 's really a case of pick your poison with those two empires . 
  the british were the golden standard when it came to cruelty ... how quickly we forget the boer war or how the british practically invented the concentration camp . 
  you people were monsters , it 's something many americans kept in mind when determining the real guilt of those who took up arms with the axis in your colonies . 
   it 's nice to see the respect and tolerance shown to people different than you in posts advocating the unification of a continent with countries and cultures different from one another . 
  respect ? 
  tolerance ? 
  no , the point of that comment was to make clear the situation we have in the us ... they 're kickbacks , we pay people off for votes with pork barrel spending . 
  that 's reality , and these people deserve the truth of what they 're wishing for . 
  speaking of `` these people '' , i 'm sure even with my mouth you 'd want someone like me deciding the fate of those `` redneck hicks '' rather than others in this thread . 
  i 've always been been a critic of the way the eu treated greece , and other small weak countries ( however irresponsible/unlikeable they may be ) , i condemned the withholding of fema aid when republicans suggested they would hold it hostage in exchange for budget cuts . 
  all of that however does not change the fact that we 're dictated to by these `` small states '' and that more often than not these people have to be bribed . 
  i would n't change it ( not yet ) but i sure as hell will gripe about it .
