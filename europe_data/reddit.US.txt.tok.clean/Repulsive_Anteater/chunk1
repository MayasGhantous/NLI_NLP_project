lol, 
   does he really ? 
  quite a lot of people do care about that , yeah . 
   ( that 's what i 've heard , anyway . ), 
  from where , / r/conspiracy ? 
  russia is supporting assad because they grant russia a preciously rare overseas naval base . 
  us wants assad to fall because syria is a long time state sponsor of terrorism . 
  and 15, 
   dictator who does n't threathen you because he knows he ca n't is better than extremists that will go jihad all the way and eventually **** up europe . 
  it is n't about what is lesser evil but what is lesser evil for us . 
  in world of ruthless politics you simply ca n't follow moral doctrines that ceased to exist there long ago . 
  you 're aware that syria was and still is a state sponsor of terrorism , right ? 
  and that libya was . 
  so you 're basically saying that we should leave countries alone that sponsor terrorist attacks against us , in case their replacement government is one that sponsors terrorism against us ? 
  terrorism has n't always had the salafist character that it 's associated with now . 
  black september would be considered secular infidels by isis standards and yet its one of the most notorious terrorist groups in history . 
  i get the sense that you 're pretty young and might not remember what the character was of terrorism before 2001 . 
   it has been shown many times , muslim countries ca n't into democracy . 
  either dictator controls them or brainwashing relligious extremists . 
  yeah that 's true , as long as you ignore turkey , burkina faso , bosnia , lebanon , kyrgyzstan , albania , bangladesh , senegal , tunisia , and indonesia . 
  sarcasm aside , that 's a racist and ignorant view . 
  please actually educate yourself from somewhere besides / r/atheism . 
  lol , and they say americans are bad at geography, 
  `` he was n't a bad guy . '', 
  - / u/nope _ 01 on saddam hussein, 
   you 're not directly responsible for the arab spring , but definitely helped it develop further . 
  the entire liberal democratic world helped there . 
  just like euromaidan in ukraine . 
  does n't mean you can blame brussels for the war in donbass . 
   same story with qaddafi . 
  air strikes definitely helped those groups topple him and now the country is on the verge of collapse . 
  that was mainly a french initiative actually . 
  the us ' main role was resupplying europeans ' stocks of pgms and other types of support . 
   if you had it your way and you removed / helped remove assad from power in syria , now the whole country would have been in the hands of isis . 
  that 's not a logical conclusion at all . 
  it 's not as if isis has been able to completely defeat any of its myriad enemies so far . 
  its not like all the shia that fight for assad are going to suddenly bend their knee to isis either . 
   all those may be evil dictators , but they are 100 times better than isis in power . 
  depends on how you look at it . 
  assad kills more civilians than isis does . 
  saddam 's death toll closes in on 500,000 , and that 's being conservative . 
  gaddafi 's many decades long campaign of torture , murder , and repression is well documented . 
  the only difference with isis is that their terror is daily headline news and its tinged by religious extremism . 
  but that they 're objectively `` worse '' than mind-bogglingly ruthless dictators is a dubious claim . 
   you ca n't forcefully democratize nations . 
  indeed , but most of the problems that created the migrant crisis are from arabs trying to democratize their own nations . 
  was n't aware that the us is also responsible for the arab spring and everything bad that came from it too now . 
  i guess i should be proud that literally everything wrong in the world is amerikkka 's fault . 
  it 's quite an achievement , honestly . 
  not exactly , no . 
  lobbying is simply the act of trying to convince lawmakers of your point of view . 
  it 's got a sinister connotation because corporations notoriously lobby congress , but civil rights advocate groups also lobby extensively . 
  in other words , it 's pr directed towards lawmakers instead of the general public . 
  donating to political campaigns with a wink and an elbow in expectation for favors later on is legalized bribing , and i think people tend to confuse this as being part of `` lobbying '' culture . 
  lobbying has its problems like corporations being able to afford far more lawyers , pitchmen , etc. 
  ( and more skilled ones ) to argue their case than rights advocates and other non-corporate entities . 
  that 's by no means the only problem , so the practice could definitely do with some ( a lot of ) regulation to make it more fair . 
  but i think the ability to petition your representatives to try to make them see your point of view is good in spirit and should be protected as free speech . 
   i 'm ashamed defense spending is at 800 billion and not massively stepped up on building a us navy with more tonnage , newer subs , stealthier subs , and greater marine deployment capability . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virginia-class_submarine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/america-class_amphibious_assault_ship https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerald_r._ford-class_aircraft_carrier  i 'm ashamed we have to choose between our obligations in the middle east and expanding into the defensibility of asian interests with a `` pivot '' . 
  i 'm aware of no such strain on operations in the middle east due to a renewed focus on asia . 
  asia has its own designated fleets , marine units , etc. 
  which are n't required or even suitable for the middle east . 
  japan 's expansion of its military power to that of a normal country only augments the friendly forces in the area . 
   we have so much work to do as voters and taxpayers in making sure american hegemony continues . 
  it 's not in any danger . 
   the f-35 and f-22 combined , in the sortie to end all sorties where we send every one we have up against chinese multi-role and fighter aircraft en mass during a conflict over taiwan , let 's say , could still be overwhelmed on the numbers . 
  what makes you think china has so many fighter planes ? 
  they have ~ 1,000 , the us has ~ 2,200 , and they 're going to buy 2,400 f-35s so it 's not like the air force is suddenly going to shrink . 
   german tanks were simply better , in every respect , than us ones in ww2 . 
  that 's only true if you discount pretty much every aspect of a tank except frontal armor and gun penetration . 
  there 's been a setup like this in south korea for a long time . 
  there 's an entire divisions worth of equipment in storage , so if korean war 2 starts up they just fly there and then hop in . 
  the vast majority of arab americans are christians . 
  i assume this is where they all come . 
  as someone who grew up poor , its absolutely required too . 
  poor people would have nothing at all without tax refunds . 
  that 's when you get your car fixed , get a new heater , etc. 
  and splurge on the bare minimum of luxury items like a nicer tv or a computer or a game system for the kids , so your life is n't an absolute miserable existence of work and hamburger helper . 
  with the eic tax credit factored in , most working people pay no federal income taxes at all and actually * receive * money . 
  which is great . 
  al jazeera is a perfectly reputable news organization . 
  it 's likely to better support ongoing and future french interventions in africa , maybe in exchange for hollande 's tougher stance on russia . 
   have you seen what goppers want ? 
  so now it 's * not * a 18th century society , the republicans just want to dial it back to then ? 
  okay then . 
  i 'm not a republican but even that revised statement is stupid . 
  let me know when they want to dismantle the financial infrastructure of the economy and return to the noble ways of the yeoman farmer . 
   and saying '' ** taking advantag ** e '' is reason enough to distrust you , as the proper way would have been * enjoying * . 
  `` taking advantage '' has many connotations , some of them negative . 
  nevertheless one of them is simply as a synonym for `` use . '', 
  if you want to assume my politics are the opposite of what they really are by reading too deep into my use of a phrase , be my guest . 
  i too remember the tales from the 1780s of elderly , free , black , gay married couples receiving their social security checks and taking advantage of medicare . 
   obviously this is just an attempt to cook the books in favor of an out vote . 
  & nbsp ; or maybe they 're just following already established british voting laws ? 
  & nbsp ;  to vote in a uk general election a person must be registered to vote and also :  * be 18 years of age or over on polling day  * ** be a british citizen , a qualifying commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the republic of ireland **  * not be subject to any legal incapacity to vote  additionally , the following ** can not ** vote in a uk general election :  * members of the house of lords ( although they can vote at elections to local authorities , devolved legislatures and the european parliament )  * ** eu citizens resident in the uk ( although they can vote at elections to local authorities , devolved legislatures and the european parliament ) **  * anyone other than british , irish and qualifying commonwealth citizens  * convicted persons detained in pursuance of their sentences ( though remand prisoners , unconvicted prisoners and civil prisoners can vote if they are on the electoral register )  * anyone found guilty within the previous five years of corrupt or illegal practices in connection with an election & nbsp ; you can prove otherwise but i assume voting in national elections is likewise restricted in most eu nations . 
  restricting voting in a country to the citizens of that country is * pretty * standard the world over . 
  i also thought the obvious conflict of interests in letting foreign born non-citizens decide a country 's destiny would be apparent to anyone , but `` apparently not . '', 
  yeah i thought this would have been obvious . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lerici-class_minehunter to be honest , the us uses a lot more foreign equipment than russia or france .
