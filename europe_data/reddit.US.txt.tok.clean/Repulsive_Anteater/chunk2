  i do n't think usmc doctrine should change just to help france out of a little financial jam . 
  that 's not realistic , sadly . 
  the usmc 's amphibious assault ships are designed to operate vtol aircraft , and mistral afaik is just a helicopter carrier . 
  even if they did have room for harriers/f -35 s , decommisioning two operational wasp-class ships or adding two mistrals to the fleet with all the training , personnel , operating costs , etc. 
  that entails is a tall order . 
  especially since the us military is currently trying to reduce costs . 
  they should sell them to japan . 
  i 'm sorry but contradicts everything you said . 
  denmark , in spite of having * more than double * the wages as the us and the * best workers rights in the world * ( which you claimed were `` very lax '' minutes ago ) is still a place that 's easier to do business in than the united states . 
  thus , there 's no demonstrable correlation between america 's lack of worker rights , deregulation , etc. 
  to explain its dominance in the technology industry , as you tried to claim , because there 's nothing to suggest that those things make it easier to do business . 
  in the end they just make it possible for successful businesses to have much higher profits . 
  therefore , the explanation probably lies elsewhere . 
  as your fellow europeans demonstrate in the comments below , one likely explanation for the issues with start-ups in the eu compared to the us is n't stifling regulation and having to pay workers a decent wage , its bureaucracy . 
  in spite of how much the eu does to make it easier to do cross-border business in the eu , the eu is n't a country and the united states is , so it 's never going to be quite as simple . 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/28/worst-countries-workers_n_5389679.html  denmark was the only country in the world to achieve a perfect score , meaning that the nation abides by all 97 indicators of workers ' rights . 
  the average wage negotiated by labor unions is also $ 20 an hour , much higher than the us pitiful federally mandated minimum wage .

  australia clearly there 's more to it than that , unless i missed the memo about denmark and norway being laissez-faire cyberpunk dystopias . 
  you said this a few days ago in another thread about the tech industry , and it still does n't make sense . 
  welfare , privacy legislation , workers rights , etc. 
  are things but they 're completely unrelated to the subject . 
  american tech companies are n't prosperous and easy to start up because the government spies on people or at-will employment is common ; the first one does n't even make sense , and high paying tech jobs are done by contract . 
  you like this idea that the eu is only worse at it because it 's actually so much better , but it 's a lot simpler than that . 
  in the us everyone speaks the same language , its cheap and simple to move anywhere , there 's more capital available for starting businesses , and that capital can move completely freely between states , there 's * far * less variation in regulation between states , etc. 
  just read some of the comments down below about fellow europeans ' issues with starting business and you 'll see , the big problem is n't `` god damn it 's so hard what with this universal health care . '', 
  the comment was a lot more diplomatic than the title makes it out to be , but then it 's rt so no surprise there . 
  they 're concentrated to specific areas . 
  someone should make a map of evangelical `` no-go zones '' ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  / u/live _ free is correct . 
  the bush years ( early/mid -2000 s ) was their big hurrah , but their political power is rapidly declining now . 
  not classical music * per se * , but probably george gershwin , scott joplin , and john philip sousa . 
  in general they 're not horrible but they 're highly flawed and inefficient , and in certain individual cases , in absolute crisis . 
  private hands ? 
  no way . 
  federal hands ? 
  absolutely . 
  fact is that some counties and cities simply are n't up to the task of properly funding and managing their school systems . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what you 're driving at . 
  there are people in europe who make 150k a year too . 
  people making 150k a year at a tech job does n't * necessarily * mean that the country the company is in is a laissez-faire wild west with no worker protections . 
  and the british guy did n't even mention eastern europe : - /, 
  worker rights in america are sorely lacking , but i think its a huge stretch to say that 's why silicon valley dominates the tech industry . 
  those companies were built on innovation . 
  can you link an example ? 
  the education system is almost universally agreed upon to be in trouble , and apart from russia i do n't recall the american media bashing eastern europe for anything . 
   free democratic societies willingly join military alliance  occupation hmm . 
  b-29s ca n't be launched from aircraft carriers . 
  this meme is getting old . 
  the policy of `` deliberate ambiguity '' is part of the deterrent . 
  the us has never stated when it would or would n't use nuclear weapons , except iirc that it would n't use them preemptively against non-nuclear powers . 
  having said that , defeat of the us from either russia or china would be worst geopolitical disaster in us history and would have far reaching consequences at home and for the world order , so i do n't have much doubt that they 'd be willing to go the distance . 
  you 're right , that slipped my mind . 
  i went with 2010 because i remember that as when there was an attempt to warm russian-polish relations . 
  russia does n't have as many foreign adventures under its belt , but that 's because it was busy turning most of its neighbors into client states . 
  i 'm envious of the constitution that was written for japan . 
  it 's frankly better than ours , articles pertaining to the specifics of japanese culture/politics aside . 
  most oil from iraq goes to china . 
  so ... no , not really . 
  he did n't try to justify it . 
  he said it was based on a petty grudge w. held against saddam and that it was a fuck up . 
  if the us wants anything with regards to russia and eastern europe , it would be to go back to the status quo of 2010 and lock it there forever . 
  rt is for external propaganda purposes and makes weak attempts at presenting itself as a legitimate news agency . 
  they stated they wanted it to be the `` russian bbc . '', 
  so i assume the channels inside russia are actually even worse , if that 's possible . 
  russia is irresponsibly stepping up its nuclear rhetoric in a bid to rattle the west , nato 's military chief has said , underlining the alliance 's concern about russian threats to deploy nuclear weapons in crimea . 
  warning that nuclear nations had to to be careful in both actions and words , gen philip breedlove said moscow was deliberately using threatening language in a bid to `` give pause to nato 's decision-making '' . 
  `` this discussion of nukes and the possibility of moving nukes into certain areas or employing nukes if something had not gone correctly in crimea and all these other things , which have been put out there -- this is not responsible language from a nuclear nation , '' he said at meeting of nato foreign ministers in antalya , turkey . 
  nato diplomats have been struck by russia 's aggressive discussion of the use of nuclear weapons , noting a pattern of threats that were rarely seen even at the height of the cold war . 
  it is prompting a potential rethink of the military alliance 's planning on deterrence and nuclear doctrine , in part to ensure no miscalculations are made in a crisis . 
  gen breedlove 's comments were reinforced in a nato joint statement with ukraine , which said the foreign ministers were `` deeply concerned by statements of the russian leadership with regard to possible future stationing of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems in crimea , which would be destabilising '' . 
  following russia 's annexation of crimea , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov 's suggested last year that it was as legitimate to deploy weapons there as any other part of russia , a position reiterated by a senior russian foreign ministry official in march . 
  gen breedlove last year noted that russia was moving forces to crimea capable of deploying tactical nuclear weapons . 
  the foreign ministers in antalya put on a united front in urging president vladimir putin of russia to stop its `` continued and deliberate destabilisation of ukraine '' and meet its obligations in implementing the minsk ceasefire accord . 
  speaking after a four-hour meeting with mr putin on monday , john kerry , the us secretary of state , noted moscow was coming to a `` critical '' moment to make good on its responsibilities . 
  while noting the `` enormous moment of opportunity '' for russia to bring a close to fighting in eastern ukraine , mr kerry gave no detail on any potential breakthrough in his talks with mr putin in sochi , the most senior visit to russia since the ukraine crisis erupted . 
  even as he noted the persistent ceasefire violations , frank-walter steinmeier , germany 's foreign minister , struck a more upbeat tone in noting `` progress in the last couple of days '' through the establishment of working groups involving representatives of the kiev government and russian-backed separatists in the donbas region . 
  since the outbreak of the conflict in eastern ukraine last year , more than 6,000 people have been killed , 15,000 wounded and a million displaced . 
  while the latest ceasefire accord has brought a lull in fighting , there have been violations throughout . 
  kiev and western countries remain worried that russian-backed forces could launch a new assault to create a land bridge linking russia to crimea . 
  jens stoltenberg , the nato secretary-general , said the ceasefire in ukraine was `` ever more fragile '' . 
  gen breedlove said the situation in eastern ukraine was `` more volatile '' . 
  `` we see training , we see re-equipping , we see new forces , new money , organisation , increased command-and-control , all these things are in a pattern across the past several times where we 've seen a push , '' he told reporters . 
  warning that nuclear nations had to to be careful in both actions and words , gen philip breedlove said moscow was deliberately using threatening language in a bid to `` give pause to nato 's decision-making '' . 
  to be frank , americans will get geared up for any war they think the us is prosecuting for altruistic reasons . 
  whether they are or not ( * cough * iraq ) is a different issue , but regardless , the public is naively idealistic about the role the us plays in the world , even if the white house practices realpolitik 99.9 % of the time . 
  and i 'm pretty sure big mean russia attacking a defenseless baltic state would give people an instant hard-on . 
   he also warned against any move to scrap or scale back britain 's ageing nuclear arsenal -- a key and expensive decision that needs to be taken by the uk government in the coming months . 
  the uk is nato 's only european nuclear power . 
  although france has atomic weapons it has a special opt-out that means its nuclear forces operate entirely independently of the alliance . 
  the us has enough nukes to go around . 
  the decision in dc will be to back the baltic states . 
  they know that if they do n't then nato will lose all credibility and would become worthless . 
  us education better than sweden ... what ?
