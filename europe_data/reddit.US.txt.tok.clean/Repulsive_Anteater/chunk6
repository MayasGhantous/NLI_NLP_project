  the war started in 2011 . 
  syrians are fleeing assad , and the us had nothing to do with causing the syrian civil war . 
  consider assad 's sponsor russia if blame has to be laid at a great power 's feet . 
  it 's not 1941 anymore , though . 
  comparing to recent wars is more indicative of the intensity of the ukrainian civil war . 
  about the same as the american military and civilian dead since 2001 , including 9/11 . 
  i hope it ends . 
  maybe the polish version wo n't be boring and vapid . 
  thanksgiving is a north american tradition , not a christian one . 
  yes , a delightful party of proto-fascists and holocaust deniers , that everyone 's willing to accept as `` moderate '' now because of a calculated rebranding by pr experts . 
  politicians are always honest , after all . 
  the us includes them in defense costs as well . 
  i try to remind people when `` muh 600 billion '' comes up . 
  most of it is paychecks , pensions , and day to day maintenance and operations . 
  hitler had facial hair too . 
  jeremy corbyn is hitler . 
  he was scum . 
  point is you know your book about fascist ideology is shit when the pioneer of fascism ca n't finish it . 
  it does n't make it impossible . 
  i used to feel the same way , but i learned that there are a lot of compromises that have been proposed to deal with the settlements issue , like offering settlers palestinian citizenship , or even giving all israelis and palestinians dual israeli and palestinian citizenship . 
  these have been proposed by major figures like arafat , so it 's not some fringe theory either . 
  the issue i think is mostly intransigent leadership on both sides . 
  we have to wait for a perfect storm of leadership on both sides . 
  there was a chance for progress with ariel sharon before he had a stroke , so i think there can be another again . 
  no worries . 
  the pm of montenegro expressed his expectation/desire to be officially invited over a year and a half ago , so the invitation is anything but accelerated . 
  it 's late . 
  so you 're saying the us ordered turkey to shoot down the plane , and invited montenegro to nato -- with psychic precognition , as the process began at least eight years ago -- in order to spite russia over what it 's doing in syria in 2015 ? 
  crumple your tinfoil hat and throw it in the garbage , man . 
  i 'm still not sure what you 're trying to say . 
  what does turkey shooting down the russian plane and montenegro being invited to join have to do with the us interfering with something ? 
  interfering with what ? 
   ( now we all know the us will certainly try to find new ways to interfere but is it really the right time for that ? ), 
  come under the nuclear umbrella , it 's nice in the shade . 
  mussolini said it was `` a boring tome that i 've never been able to finish . '', 
  now we know where nigel powers is coming from . 
  it 's not anything to do with mysterious arab culture or tribalism , either . 
  they 're simply imaginary countries that arbitrarily group distinct ethnic and religious people together . 
  unless you consider de facto nations of millions of people `` tribes , '' which would be a bit orientalist . 
  for this we have yet another european example of the exact same situation having the exact same result : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_wars, 
   europe want through a perhaps the most violent war in human history before reaching the period of peace and prosperity that you 've experienced for the better part of the last century . 
   it seems short sighted to de-cry the `` perpetual violence '' of the me and the necessity of dictatorships to maintain order . 
  that 's an interesting point . 
  the thing is that if it came to an actual war between turkey and russia , it does n't really matter why or who started it . 
  if it does n't technically meet the requirements for article v , then the us and select allies will just form an ad hoc coalition to help turkey anyway . 
  turkey is an extremely important country strategically and it wo n't be allowed to be humiliated , neutered , or destroyed all alone on a mere technicality . 
  in the end international affairs are governed by realpolitik , nothing more . 
  i agree definitely especially when it comes to germany . 
  for being the largest member of nato aside from the united states they 're definitely not pulling their weight or keeping up with the times . 
  revelations in the past few years are that their air force readiness rate is terrible with many planes grounded and lacking spare parts , the ammo for the leopard 2 is no longer able to defeat modern russian armor , then there 's the faulty g36s that melt if you fire them full auto . 
  and , of course , the infamous broomstick event . 
  also what i 've seen of current bundeswehr training looks like summer camp compared to the us , uk , france , poland , etc. 
  example : https://youtu.be/faayd_r6baa they need to figure out what to do about this . 
  france and poland are perfect examples of how to have significant numbers of ground forces and strategic capability without going nuts on military spending . 
  maybe they should be emulated . 
  i know it does n't seem urgent right now but the last few years proved that history did n't end in 1991 , you 've got to continuously be on the ball . 
  russia is heading for some terrifying financial problems by 2017 , who knows what that might lead to ... 
   i know that russia bombed hospital but actually all those hospitals are in isis/rebels controlled area . 
  well that makes it a-okay then . 
  they 're just terrorist hospitals , so who cares ? 
  but taliban being in the msf hospital does n't make it okay . 
  very consistent logic there . 
  you 're a colossal idiot . 
  the extreme emphasis some put on the 2 % spending targets is kind of a red herring . 
  it would be nice if everyone met the target but the alliance is n't worthless because many do n't . 
  countries are either just fine not spending that much , like france which seems to get a lot of bang for its buck in terms of money spent for capability available . 
  or they 're so small that no matter what they spent it 's not going to significantly strengthen the alliance ; do we really want to beat up on netherlands and lithuania for not having legions of doom ? 
  a significant number of countries in nato have populations smaller than a couple boroughs of new york city . 
  the only country that bothers me a little with its lack of military readiness is germany , but germany is n't threatened by a russian border and it was never relied on in nato for its navy or any other kind of strategic capability , so again does it really matter ? 
  all the major players that * need * to be doing their part are doing it . 
  the uk , france , poland , and the united states are more than enough in land , naval , and nuclear power to curbstomp anything russia can throw at the alliance . 
  if i 'm being really honest , the main function of the 2 % spending target is to give bitter americans an official reason to piss and moan about muh pussy europeans and something to blame the deficit on . 
  any talk of protecting nato allies from russian aggression implicitly means the baltic states . 
  poland strong , but the baltic states have extremely small populations , so even if they devoted 50 % of gdp to defense , they 're not going to have anything that will repel a russian invasion . 
  this is simply collective defense in action . 
  they need a helping hand and i 'm proud that we offer it . 
  there are also european nato units from france , uk , etc , rotating through eastern europe . 
  it 's not all on uncle sam 's shoulders . 
   you do realise that america funded the groups that brought down the previous secular government that 's a pretty selective reading of what took place in afghanistan . 
  it would be much more accurate , actually , to say that a [ soviet-backed coup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saur_revolution ) brought down the previous [ secular , republican , moderate government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_afghanistan ) of afghanistan and then turned the population against them [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_afghanistan_ ( 1978 % e2 % 80 % 9392 ) #reforms _ and_oppression .2 c_1978 . e2 .80.9379 ] with a reckless disregard for the traditional culture of afghanistan and a typically leninist pitifully mismanaged attempt at land and economic reform . 
  the soviet union set in motion the wheels that turned afghanistan into a war-torn shithole for 35 years . 
  the united states merely reacted to it in order to create a result beneficial to its interests . 
  did this us interference make things better ? 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  but to say that us backed groups brought down the secular government is arbitrarily placing the start of the troubles a lot later than they actually did start . 
  it started with the soviet-backed saur revolution . 
   the same groups that went on to form the taliban . 
  more like the same groups that went on to form the northern alliance . 
  like syria today , the anti-soviet militants in afghanistan were not a unified and ideologically homogeneous group . 
  the closest you can link the united states to the taliban is money it gave to pakistan who then used it to support groups that lead to the taliban . 
  this is similar to how turkey , a us ally , was exposed for lending aid to the islamic state , which obviously was n't what the us would like ( unless you like to visit / r/conspiracy ) . 
  both of these situations more condemn the recipients of aid for supporting bad actors and the us for not having as good of an idea of what might happen to the money as they should have . 
  not good but a far cry from the implication that the us was shipping bags of cash and crates of stingers directly to osama bin laden and mullah omar . 
  i do n't want to be condescending but the modern history of afghanistan is extremely complex , and the typical idea that people have of it thanks to certain movies and unconfirmed speculation is n't really accurate . 
  the first step for russia eradicating isis would be to actually bomb isis instead of 90 + % third party rebels opposed to assad . 
  russia is there to support their client state , nothing more , just like the united states and its interests . 
   but they are talented on bombing hospitals i have to leave that to them so is russia if you follow [ the news ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/22/three-syrian-hospitals-bombed-since-russian-airstrikes-began-doctors-say ) re : their bombing campaign in syria . 
  do n't fall victim to confirmation bias . 
  ** yugoslavia ** - there was already a war there , us/nato intervention ended it . 
  ** afghanistan ** - russia ( ie the former soviet union ) has nothing to do with that at all of course .
