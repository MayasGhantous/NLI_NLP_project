  country 's been at war since before i was born , but at least now music is legal , and women can get an education and walk the streets without wearing a sheet . 
  ** libya ** - mainly a european effort really , with us support , but sure . 
  never mind that there was already a civil war taking place with an apparent mass genocide imminent . 
  ** iraq ** - fair point ** syria ** - the united states did n't foment the syrian civil war , the regime did that all on their own by murdering protesters , bolstered by their russian ally ** yemen ** - you have to reach pretty far and deep to explain why this is the us ' fault . 
  yemen is a historically unstable and violent country and has a myriad of problems separate from the us droning al-qaeda suspects , especially considering that the anti-government rebels there are shia ( note : al-qaeda are not ) . 
   causing massive refugee crysis most people in syria are actually fleeing al-assad , not the islamic state . 
  if you have to blame a third party for this , i guess you have to settle for russia . 
  tl ; dr - geopolitics are complicated, 
  i think there should be more treaties like five eyes that explicitly forbid allies from spying on each other . 
  though until there is , they will , because they can . 
  this is how it works and you 'd have to be pretty euphoric not to accept it , even from supposedly lawful good countries like germany . 
  treadstone, 
  true enough , i was just making a point that an airframe being older does n't tell the whole story . 
  the f-16 is the backbone of the entire free world 's air power so it 's been given exceptional attention in modernization that does n't make its case comparable to a mig-21 or something . 
  we are required by natural law to believe that russian actions are always brilliant and will never backfire . 
   against current weaponary , no , but in a third world war i think it 's highly likely it 'd be inevitable to resort to such mass production again no , man . 
  just ... no . 
  you have to design the `` mass producable '' tanks . 
  then you have to test them to make sure they work . 
  then you have to design the factories to build them . 
  then you have to train people to use the factories to build them . 
  then you have to train people how to use them . 
  then you have to deploy them . 
  this takes * years * . 
  it was two years from the design of the m4 sherman to the first one entering service . 
  in a full scale world war iii scenario , one side or the other is going to rapidly lose basic capability in warfighting within weeks because the equipment the us , russia , china , and the eu operates is today is that lethal and there 's absolutely no prospect of replenishment in a timely matter . 
  once one side starts to lose equipment faster than the other , the advantage of the winning side starts growing exponentially until the disadvantaged side is crushed . 
  every other scenario ( limited objectives for one or both sides , a quick ceasfire shortly after hostilities break out , nuclear force , etc. ), 
  also have the war ending relatively quickly . 
  this was the understanding of cold war strategists in the 70s and 80s , and for real world evidence you can look at israel 's conventional wars which were all very destructive and very short . 
  in the yom kippur war , israel [ was losing tanks , planes , and other equipment at such a rate that it was preparing to use nuclear weapons to defend itself ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yom_kippur_war#u.s._aid_to_israel ) . 
  what saved the idf was a [ direct injection of already made war materiel to israel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_nickel_grass ) ; countries like the us and russia do n't have that luxury because they 're at the top of the arms industry food chains . 
  this is how modern conventional war works . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mxw4v/russian_parliament_unanimously_approves_use_of/cvj59iv the picture you have of factory workers slaving away pumping out dozens of tanks and planes a day like ww2 era stock footage is n't true anymore . 
  modern military production is too slow and too technical to match the rate of losses they 'd see in modern combat . 
  you lose or win with what you have when hostilities break out . 
  no offense man but you do n't understand how warfare works in 2015 . 
  the gross regional product of crimea is very low , and what they 've got in donetsk from industry is canceled out by the money pit that supporting breakaway statelets is ; the dpr is supported almost entirely by direct injections of money by moscow . 
  and all that industry has ground to a halt now . 
  in 1943 , yes . 
  modern wars do n't last long enough or are n't high intensity enough for industrial output to matter . 
  modern tanks , helicopters , planes , etc. 
  take a long time to build with their technical hardware and computer software , so in a full scale conflict you ca n't possibly replace equipment even remotely at the same pace as they 're being lost . 
  you win or lose with the stuff you have when the war starts . 
  this was the case even in the 1980s , it 's even more true today . 
  on the other hand in a low intensity conflict like the one in ukraine , losses of heavy equipment are n't devastating enough that the slow production times will become an issue , if you even have to build new equipment to replace the old stuff at all . 
  ukraine has almost 3,000 tanks . 
  the loss of maybe a dozen or two during the civil war hardly creates a crisis in war production . 
  old airframe but with that comes far more maturity [ gripen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9ta2emv.png ) [ f-16 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hxaxfvj.png ) by this point the f-16 is capable of doing pretty much any kind of mission a modern jet might be expected to do . 
   wwiii is on , and so far russia is winning . 
  care to explain ? 
  they 've won the least profitable parts of a poor country ukraine and have committed themselves to defending a weak dictator for life , and to pay for these things they 've basically flushed their economy and a generation 's future down the toilet . 
   by any means almost a quarter of the global gdp . 
  the united states has more money than anyone else . 
  it is the most successful and powerful country in the world . 
  i. . . do n't know how to explain it better . 
  maybe you should check again what the word `` prosperity '' means . 
  lol, 
  pirating max max : fury road helps make up for government surveillance ? 
   multiculturalism is a monumental failure , and will almost always fail . 
  last time i checked the united states of america was the most prosperous nation in the world . 
  what it lacks in social programs is due to other factors besides multiculturalism , but you can also look at canada too , a multicultural nation of immigrants that is `` great '' by any objective measurement besides military power and global influence . 
  on reddit , enforcement of intellectual property rights is a sign that we live in an orwellian dystopia . 
  suppression of enemy air defenses . 
  technology and tactics used to neutralize an enemy 's air defense network . 
  this is extremely important considering russia has the best sams in the world . 
  currently i really only know of two countries that have combat experience in sead , the us and israel . 
  possibly the uk in the gulf war ( edit : and falklands ofc ) but i 'm not sure . 
  i do n't expect there will ever be an eu army that supersedes all national armies , i 'm talking about a fully integrated corps or army-sized formation with the same strategic capabilities the usmc gets at that size , with each country pitching in their pound of flesh for it but retaining their national military . 
  models to emulate would be the [ xviii airborne corps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xviii_airborne_corps ) that the us army has or , again , the usmc . 
  a completely self sufficient eu force of 100,000 + men , fully integrated , self sufficient , its own c&c , planes , logstics , lingua franca among officers , etc. 
  would be a very potent force . 
  the population of the baltic states prevent them from having any serious defensive capability against russia . 
  the only deterrent is to permanently station a large military force there or to be able to get there really really fast . 
  the former is n't the case , so we have to rely on the latter , and right now only the us is capable of that . 
  europe has what it takes for it but only if it gets serious about creating a truly formidable eu army that is fully integrated . 
  nato 's ( including the united states ' ) current fetish for tiny , rotating , light infantry brigades is little more than morale-boosting propaganda and are capable of very little . 
   sorry , but you 're exaggerating a bit i 'm not exaggerating , maybe you 're reading too much into what i said . 
  i 'm aware of the capabilities that european nations have , and many of them are capabilities correspondent with the size of their country . 
  what 's relevant to providing a unified defense against an outside aggressor is how those capabilities integrate with each other , and the answer is very poorly . 
  it 's enough of an ordeal to arrange logistics in the us military , now imagine that all your strategic airlift capability or anti-submarine capability is in another country . 
  there 's more to providing an effective defence of europe than having the correct number of things ( tanks , transport planes , people , etc. ), 
  down on paper when added together . 
  it 's getting them to the crisis point in a timely matter and having effective command and control of all of it . 
  if russia invaded estonia right now and europe was to respond by itself , the response would be slow and disorganized . 
  it ca n't match the efficiency of a large national military until it 's integrated as one , it 's just a fact of military science . 
  this was n't an issue for nato during the cold war because there was a very clear front line and there were huge forces permanently stationed on it , each with their own areas of responsibility ( geographically and otherwise ) . 
  nato does n't have such a defense infrastructure on the russian border today so until it does , an extremely fast response time is the only thing that can deter aggression . 
   the europeans lack offensive capability , but their defence is still formidable enough that 's an issue when the situation calls for recapturing the territory of countries that * are n't * capable of defending themselves . 
  the defensive capability of several nations in harm 's way is practically zero . 
  poland may have the numbers and equipment to defend themselves personally from an invasion , but do they have the logistical capacity , combined arms expertise , sead training , etc. 
  to liberate the territory of another country from a russian occupier in a timely manner ? 
  perhaps , but i would n't bet the house on it . 
  a combined eu army ( or at least a very large integrated unit , like an army-sized unit ) would have such strategic capabilities that constituent eu members lack on their own , because so much is wasted on overhead when the `` eu force '' is divided by two dozen countries . 
  of course there are n't any credible threats to dutch territory and have n't been for a while , what more concerns me is the question of what kind of contribution they could possibly make to a nato mission when their military is in that kind of state . 
  the point of the alliance is that you 're ready to help defend your fellow members , not just yourself . 
  this just further illustrates how more and more the united states is becoming the only military europe has to confront russia in the event of a crisis ( or some other unforeseen country in the future ) . 
  and its not just some jingoistic rant . 
  if things continue the way they 're going , there 's also no way it does n't get used as a tool by the united states to strongarm europe at some point on some issue . 
  if europe ever wants to get completely out from under the thumb of the united states ( and possibly china in the future ) it should be able to credibly defend itself from any superpower , let alone rotting russia .
