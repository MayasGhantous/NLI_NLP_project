  black like the dirt of labor , red like the blood of battle , and gold is the future . 
  at least that 's how i was taught to interpret it . 
   especially when it comes to the u.s. state department doing international things .

  enter at your own risk . 
  maybe / b/tards really do go outside sometimes, 
  i think you misunderstood me . 
  i know youre not talking about destroying people who already exist . 
  but what youre suggesting is that having a disability could lead to a life not worth living , i.e. 
  that it would be better if they were never born at all . 
  right ? 
  i cant imagine another way to interpret your rationale for not letting someone with a disability reproduce . 
  what im saying is someone with a disability can decide whether or not it was worth being born with their disability and if their child has a chance at enjoying life , even if they end up with the same condition . 
  i think people with disabilities are better suited than people without disabilities to decide whether their disability inevitably leads to a life of suffering that was so horrible , it was n't even worth living . 
  there are plenty of laws out there that arent enforced and people dont care about . 
  / u/salsariable covered the rest . 
  and it 's not like people with disabilities are n't already shamed into not having kids . 
  you dont think people with dwarfism get enough shit for having kids ? 
  and you seriously want more of that ? 
  [ dendrophilia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dendrophilia_%28paraphilia%29 ) trees do n't need to consent because they do n't have a consciousness . 
  make a wooden dildo , nobody cares , bore a hole in a tree at the local park and next thing you know youre in an orange jump suit picking up trash along the side of the highway . 
  it 's horseshit !, 
  it might sound like indoctrination of youth to an outsider but really it 's not all that sinister . 
  originally these european political youth groups started off as alternatives for young working class people who didnt go to university and therefore couldnt participate in something similar to what americans know as the republican or democratic students ' unions at colleges ( or whatever they might be referred to at your particular institution ) . 
  the youth groups provided a platform for young working class people where they could organize and have their voices heard by their political party . 
  now , there 's a lot more involvement of young students , but the premise remains mostly the same . 
  and as we see in this example , the actual party they represent is n't always super fond of the youth groups because the youth groups will sometimes take party ideology to absurd extremes . 
  so it 's not so much a recruiting and indoctrination tool for the party as it is a platform for young people to use to influence the party . 
  sometimes it 's a good thing , sometimes they take things a bit too far . 
  how do you propose to enforce that ban ? 
  forced sterilization ? 
  solitary is a more passive form of torture so there 's a bit more moral ambiguity there that you can hide behind . 
  lookin at you , mormons, 
  things the germans `` discuss '' during the annual voraschermittwochs\u00fcndenfest : * the proper name for the celebration * the red horse * 1000 naked women using the urinal * the shade of the cathedral * she had nothing left on but shoes * viva colonia * 20cm * the worst thing is when the beer 's empty etc, 
  how do you figure ? 
  on the other hand , there 's not that many conservative american expats in germany . 
  no one has mastered the neck beard like [ the amish ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=amish+beard ), 
  it 's funny because l\u00f6l means lol in german . 
  not blowing themselves up , but the raf , lichtenhagen and nsu were all pretty widely reported . 
  sounded like the same voice to me . 
  if that 's the case then that makes this whole thing even more sad . 
  there 's also the video where someone from an apartment balcony shouts `` schei\u00df kanacken '' at the shooter , to which the shooter replies `` ich bin deutscher . 
  it 's not * as * bad now with the [ ug ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/unternehmergesellschaft ), 
  what public servants dont speak english ? 
  you mean at the grocery store ? 
  and who in germany insists on anything other than elektronische \u00fcberweisung ? 
  the long waiting times for appointments are the only thing i can see being true recently , but that 's because the ausl\u00e4nder\u00e4mte are super busy with all the refugees . 
  normally its not * that * bad . 
  i now have you tagged as putenficker . 
  i hope you feel honored . 
   things do n't get left inside the patient etc. 
  ah you mean like baked potatoes for example . 
  well in that case i should be excited about trump, 
  really now ? 
  then there must be a lot of austrians/belgians in berlin . 
  i think that 's exactly what is implied when people say `` turkey '' rather than `` turkish people . '', 
  would this also apply to underground gay sex dungeons or just in public ? 
  if you spoke irish instead of english you could avoid the confusion all together . 
  lookin at you kramer . 
  hillary and bill de blasio . 
  or that remake of harry potter they shouldve made where he packs a 1911 . 
  a * lot * of groups self-segregate , especially when there 's a language barrier . 
  never been to china town ? 
  you shouldna dunnat , he jut a boay . 
  poor lil feller . 
  idk where you live , but plenty of left leaning people in germany were freaked out by trump . 
  they see brexit and trump as a sign that they have to take the afd more seriously as a contender and work harder to beat them in the elections . 
  thus the schulz subreddit was born . 
  right wing populism is n't something you can write off and ignore as an anglophone problem . 
  trump and brexit are a bad sign for everyone . 
  so do we, 
  and yet you 're blown away by the vile aggression of calling hillary goldman sachs ? 
  if i get banned for saying you 're full of shit , it 'd be worth it because someone 's got ta say it .
