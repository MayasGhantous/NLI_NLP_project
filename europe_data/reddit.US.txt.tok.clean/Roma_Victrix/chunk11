  this is hardly the most noteworthy thing mentioned in chinese histories , though , considering how they accurately depicted the locations of rome 's vassal states in the roman orient , how they got things correct about roman law like the practice of * poena cullei * , how the romans were the producers of all the exotic glass on the other end of the world ( noting how they traded it to the persians and indians ) , and even mentioned that ten roman silver coins equalled one golden coin ( relatively close to the roman * denarius * and * solidus * conversions ) . 
  hitler sure does have a lot of spunk and stamina for a 127-year-old man born in 1889 . 
  i think even countries like turkey would be on board with this idea , seeing how turkey has taken in over 2 million syrian refugees . 
  i 'm sure they 'd like to lessen their own load . 
  same for the overly-exhausted refugee shelters in neighboring lebanon ( to say nothing of europeans who are fed up with this and have n't even seen the full wave of it yet , since there are still millions of displaced syrians still trapped in syria ) . 
  yeah , nagasaki was n't so much a refugee city as it was a crater with refugee survivors fleeing from it and the radiation . 
  that being said , i do n't think the hungarian pm 's idea is a bad one , so long as libya agrees ( or rather , the government in libya we happen to be cooperating with at the moment , since there is more than one government operating in libya at the moment ) . 
  a shame that you 're not getting much action !, 
  if only there were more earthquakes there . 
  sigh . 
  are you saying that this was consensual foreplay with an earthquake ? 
  awesome . 
  that 's sexual harassment , buddy . 
  that earthquake will see you in court , male pig . 
  maybe next time you 'll keep your touchy-feely hands to yourself !, 
  my favorite quote from that film ( 1998 ) :  ** g\u00e9za , grand prince of the hungarians ** : there was a moment , when i used to blame everything and everyone for all the pain and suffering and vile things that happened to me , that i saw happen to my people , the magyars . 
  used to blame everybody . 
  blamed white people , blamed society , blamed god - before i converted . 
  i did n't get no answers 'cause i was asking the wrong questions . 
  you have to ask the right questions . 
   ** stephen i of hungary ** : like what ? 
   ** g\u00e9za , grand prince of the hungarians ** : has anything you 've done made your life better ? 
  he certainly had a wise , socratic father !, 
  when he said he wanted to kick all the jews out of hungary , he applied the same rule to himself . 
  truly this is a rare man of principle !, 
  how dare you cast aspersions onto our lord and savior sauron .

  greece is punk rock like that . 
   we do n't respect our fellow citizens or public space in general . 
  probably why our cities are nasty dumps , while at the same time the average greek housewife wo n't tolerate a layer of dust in her furniture . 
  this is absolutely reversed when you look at ancient greece , where the homes of even the wealthy were somewhat modest , not too ornate ( especially on the walls facing the street ) , yet it was the public space that was revered . 
  rich men donated money to the polis in order to beautify the public space , the agora , and these monuments were symbols of their wealth and pride . 
  i guess that greek culture was thoroughly and irrevocably changed by first the ( roman ) byzantines and then the venetian and ottoman occupiers . 
  the main takeaway from that map is the fact that tibetan buddhism , while maintianing but a toehold in the caucasus , will soon dominate all others under the powerful guidance of the dalai lama ( who shall then resume his rightful place at the potala palace , free from the exile in india , and force beijing to bow to his spritual wisdom like in times of old , during the ming and qing dynasties of china ) . 
  they 're absolutely lovely . 
  it would be even better if you matched 17th , 18th , and 19th century paintings of the same cities next to each other , to see the differences and continuations . 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's one of the stupidest things i 've ever heard . 
  loved , paris , though . 
  i 'd be happy to visit again . 
  that payment sounds tremendous . 
  just a reminder that we need to prepare for a future impact and extinction event by knocking enormous , dangerous meteors off course and away from our planet ( with nuclear bombs maybe ? 
  ) , so they can fuck off and hit some other planet that does n't matter . 
  i 've seen that movie several times and i did n't even remember that line !, 
  i do vividly remember the conversation about bigus dickus though . 
  lol . 
  i always thought he said the `` meek '' , not greek . 
  proves how much i know !, 
  thanks for enlightening me . 
  so was jesus greek too , not a nice jewish boy from the levant ? 
  replace burgers with gyros , then ? 
  what about china ? 
  are they greek too but just do n't know it yet ? 
  i 'm aware of the galatians , who even served as mercenaries in ptolemaic egypt . 
  i included tunisia because of carthage and lebanon because of the original phoenicians . 
  france is obviously because of brittany but also because of ancient gaul . 
  you could easily include italy for two reasons : the romans and the ancient celts who used to rule northern italy ( beyond the realm of the etruscans ) . 
  my knowledge is really fuzzy on the earliest details of the kingdom of asturias ' history , so thanks for the info once again !, 
  good points . 
  you expressed them better than i did ( although this was the idea i was trying to relay ) . 
  this conversation has taken a fun turn ; how should this dispute be settled , then ? 
  a merger between greece and spain ? 
  lol . 
  in that case italy and tunisia would have to join too ( maybe lebanon as well ... the celts lived in spain , so france and ireland and scotland too ? 
  is it even more amazing than the italian criminal justice system ? 
  italian police are generally very professional . 
  this , on the other hand , is pure bureaucratic sloppiness . 
  i was under the impression that it continued as a coherent state from its founding . 
  my mistake !, 
  thanks for the correction . 
  what 's that got to do with anything ? 
  particularly this article . 
  yes , obviously nazism and their ideology has nothing to do with modern anthropological studies . 
  about 10 % of people in the iberian peninsula to this day share y-chromosomal dna with north african berbers , for instance ( roughly the same figure for sicily ) . 
  i 'm also well aware of the various empires that controlled all or parts of spain , including the greek colonies and even carthage before losing their territories there to rome in the second punic war . 
  celtic peoples dominated central and northern parts of the peninsula before the roman conquest , and obviously long before the migration of germanic peoples into spain in the 5th century ad . 
  then you had the lusitani who perhaps formed their own branch of the indo-european language family , and even non-indo-europeans like the basque people . 
  you guys really do have a smattering of this and that , do n't you ? 
   as for the muslims , they controlled nearly all of spain in the 8th century but then started losing parts of it even then , and they never conquered the kingdom of asturias . 
  by the 9th century the whole northern belt touching the atlantic was out of their control . 
  by the 10th century they had about 4/5ths of the peninsula . 
  by the middle of the 12th century this had been reduced drastically to only half the peninsula . 
  by the 13th century and the destruction of the almohads it was basically a rump state that was less than a third of the peninsula . 
  by the beginning of the 14th century the emirate of granada controlled a small piece of land to the far south , nearly two centuries before castile finally mustered the wherewithal to conquer it in 1492 ( instead of keeping it as a convenient little vassal , as it had done for almost that entire time ) . 
  from the article :  spain is to request the return of visigoth artefacts given to nazi germany to help prove theories about the common ` aryan ' ancestry of spain and germany . 
   gold and bronze cups , necklaces and human bones excavated from a visigoth necropolis near segovia , north of madrid , were given to heinrich himmler by spain 's fascist leader general francisco franco after the ss chief visited madrid in 1940 . 
  this is interesting , part of the larger nazi effort to document `` aryan '' heritage around the world , spanning from spain all the way to xinjiang in northwest china ( with the indo-european tocharians , saka , yuezhi , sogdians , etc. ) . 
  spain was an obvious choice given both the fellow fascist leader franco looking for political allies ( or at least guaranteeing neutrality during wwii ) and visigothic-era spain . 
  the visigothic legacy continued even during the islamic period after the 8th-century umayyad conquest , with the christian kingdom of asturias in northern spain . 
  its successor state was the kingdom of leon , which later merged with the crown of castile . 
  the latter would go on to reconquer most of spain by the 13th century ( including cordoba ) , and finally conquered its ( already heavily reduced ) muslim vassal the emirate of granada in 1492 ad . 
  franco was no monarch , of course ; the king of spain alfonso xiii of spain fled the country in exile back in the 1930s . 
  yet franco was perhaps more interested in showing some sort of genetic link instead of just simple succession of ruling regimes going all the way back to visigothic spain and kingdom of asturias . 
  in either case , this last bit at the end :  however the collection was not well catalogued , so it is expected that spain will struggle to prove the items belong to madrid . 
  ... means that germany and austria will most likely not be obligated at all to return anything . 
  if it was n't properly catalogued , then it may as well be deemed as having no provenance before appearing in german and austrian museums . 
  that 's a shame for spain , but to be honest their collections are already littered with visigothic stuff , to say nothing of roman stuff . 
  it would be one thing if these treasures were akin to a national symbol , like the elgin marbles ( of the parthenon on the athenian acropolis ) that have produced such a kerfuffle between the uk and greece . 
  long story short : paperwork matters !, 
  this is just awful . 
  my condolences to the kyrgyz whose loved ones have died in this horrible way .
