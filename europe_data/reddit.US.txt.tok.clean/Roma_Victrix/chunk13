  i hope that works . 
  this is a natural disaster of epic proportions regardless . 
  i agree that more time should be spent highlighting the lives of their victims instead of the terrorists themselves , beyond cursory information that 's necessary for the public to understand the situation . 
  there 's also nothing wrong in mocking them ; it 's harmless actually and lets people blow off steam . 
  yet it 's not a substitute for a real strategy in combatting the ideology of jihad in the modern day . 
  that 's all i 'm saying . 
  this needs to be a multifaceted approach that engages the muslim communities of europe in a serious way and on a very comprehensive level , socially speaking . 
  mocking people with clown noses is all fine and good , but there needs to be widespread community outreach if not government-sponsored information campaigns aimed at troubled sunni muslim youths ( particularly an arab and berber audience , afghan and pakistani pashtuns too , since other sunnis like turks , kazakhs , kurds and indonesians are n't nearly as prone to engaging in these sorts of terrorist acts , largely for historical reasons ) . 
  and by that i mean addressing real points in islamic theology that are driving this violence , combined with the historical grievances about colonialism and western powers engaging in wars in the middle east . 
  what do jews or communism have to do with this ? 
  let alone ancient greeks and romans , and medieval vikings . 
  at least someone here gets it . 
  the adoption of wahhabism by the saudi royal family has been one of the most disastrous turn of events for the whole world , not just the saudi arabian people themselves . 
  their ideology is perfectly in line with isis and they even do a lot of similar stuff , like propagate the destruction of art ( iconoclasm ) , holy sites and tombs . 
  what you said makes little sense , given the context of what ov3rpowered just said above . 
  people who are convinced that they are on a mission from god ( allah ) to kill non-believers are not going to be swayed by reason or logic , let alone ridicule and satire . 
  this is not an effective strategy against jihad . 
  it looks funny , i 'll give you that , and perhaps provides some comic relief for such a dark topic . 
  yet it betrays a childish ignorance about the beliefs of isis and salafi muslim radicals , that they actually care what the kafir thinks of them . 
  to them we are future dhimmi at best , second-class subjects of islamic authority and ultimately damned to hell for not being muslims . 
  some people actually have tried to overwhelm isis twitter accounts and other social media accounts with gay porn . 
  that 's pretty damn funny , actually , considering how much they hate the gays and throw them off of rooftops . 
  they care when the prophet is ridiculed , because they are taught to love him as much if not more than their own family . 
  in fact , one 's family members are pretty expendable . 
  if someone 's brother or sister decides to leave islam as an apostate to become an atheist or convert to some other religion like christianity , then they are marked for death . 
  that 's how many honor killings have been carried out in the middle east , that and eloping with a person outside of an arranged marriage or having sex before marriage . 
  just no . 
  lol . 
  you think this is a deterrence for someone who literally believes in the islamic concept of heaven ( arabic : \u062c\u0646\u0651\u0629 * jannah * ) and rewards in the afterlife for martyrs who killed kafir infidels during jihad ? 
  if a sunni muslim thinks that they will be guaranteed salvation in heaven for killing christians , atheists , hindus , sikhs , buddhists , etc. 
  then a cute media campaign with clown noses is not going to register or persuade them to do otherwise . 
  and yes , even the footsoldiers and petty criminals who become terrorists in europe for isis are well aware about the basic tenets of their faith , if not the promises of rewards for martyrdom . 
  this is the sort of propaganda that isis ( a literal apocalyptic death cult ) peddles constantly in their recruitment strategy , in addition to professing that they are the one true caliphate ( khalifa ) and that all muslims who do not bow to them and show their loyalty are considered apostates who will burn in hellfire for all eternity .

  the most underrated comment in this thread . 
  well done , sir . 
  it would have been chainmail , not plate armor , in the 11th-12th century . 
  some people of the levant look very white , others olive-skinned . 
  i suppose people here are right that turks have a similar range , with a significantly larger central asian component to their dna ( thanks to the medieval seljuk invaders of the byzantine empire in the 11th century and others ) . 
  however , i do n't think on average palestinians look as `` white '' as the spanish supermodels [ clara alonso ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alejandra+alonso&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_-vfkooboahvsacakhuczb1cq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659#tbm=isch&amp;q=clara+alonso ) and [ alejandra alonso ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alejandra+alonso&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_-vfkooboahvsacakhuczb1cq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659 ) . 
  good point about them being bourbons . 
  and yes , spaniards do have a range . 
  i guess turks do as well , but are there any turks that look as `` white '' as the spanish supermodels [ clara alonso ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alejandra+alonso&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_-vfkooboahvsacakhuczb1cq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659#tbm=isch&amp;q=clara+alonso ) and [ alejandra alonso ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alejandra+alonso&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_-vfkooboahvsacakhuczb1cq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659 ) ? 
  okay , good point , but what about these two well-known spanish models ? 
  are they not indicitave of the native population of spain ?

  throw them into a spanish setting in antiquity and they could blend in well with ancient celtiberians or romans ( with different hair and clothes of course , lol ) . 
  perhaps brown is the wrong word ( more apt to describing indians , pakistanis , mixed-race/amerindian mexicans and brazilians , etc. ) . 
  olive is more appropriate . 
  fair enough . 
  here are some well-known spanish women , and they do not look like turks : [ clara alonso ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alejandra+alonso&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_-vfkooboahvsacakhuczb1cq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659#tbm=isch&amp;q=clara+alonso ) and [ alejandra alonso ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alejandra+alonso&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_-vfkooboahvsacakhuczb1cq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659 ) . 
  fair enough . 
  some turks are olive skinned and even darker , while some are also fair-skinned and even have light hair and light eyes like most northern europeans . 
  it was that way in the mediterranean going back to antiquity , although anatolia has a significantly larger amount of central asian genes now thanks to the arrival and invasions of turkic peoples , beginning with the seljuks . 
  that 's why many turks also look like a mixture of asiatic ( i.e. 
  mongoloid ) and caucasian . 
  your crowd picture shows some really dark spaniards . 
  spaniards also look like [ clara alonso ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alejandra+alonso&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_-vfkooboahvsacakhuczb1cq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659#tbm=isch&amp;q=clara+alonso ) and [ alejandra alonso ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=alejandra+alonso&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_-vfkooboahvsacakhuczb1cq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659 ) . 
  i 'm not sure why , but this tickles the hell out of me . 
  perhaps roughly ~ 7-10 % of the population of spain looks brown or `` middle eastern '' thanks to ~ 7-10 % of spaniards sharing y-chromosomal dna with north africans ( i.e. 
  moors , berbers ) , but saying spaniards look like turks in general is really pushing it . 
  spaniards look about as white as frenchmen on average . 
  i do n't think anyone would confuse his majesty king felipe vi of spain with a turkish guy , or his wife letizia , queen of spain , with a turkish lady . 
  that 's reasonable . 
  20 rounds indicates that you wanted the attacker to die at all costs , instead of just incapacitating him/her as necessary in order to halt the attack , if only temporarily . 
  lol . 
  what ? 
  either this is sarcasm , or you do n't understand much about salafism and jihad . 
  i 've never been knife-attacked before , but i can think of only a few things that sound more horrific ( like being eaten or burned alive ) . 
  german cops put that train axemen refugee down with gunfire when he came at them with his axe . 
  i 'd say that was proportionate . 
  the same should apply to civilians when someone 's coming at them with a butcher knife . 
  even in a country of millions , 50,000 people is still astounding . 
  that is grotesque . 
  clearly not all of them had something to do with this coup . 
  this is just more bs opportunism by erdogan to silence critics and seize even more powers for himself .
