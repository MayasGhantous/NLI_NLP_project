  impeachment ca n't be ruled out , yet despite the precedent of presidents being impeached by the house , it 's never been approved by the senate in us history . 
  nixon resigned before things ever got to that point over watergate . 
  then again , trump does n't have the common sense or wit of nixon , so he 'd probably barrel through and attempt to intimidate congressmen , but failing spectacularly in the end . 
  your scenario , however , is far more likely . 
  that 's probably exactly the response he wants to invoke . 
  it 's almost as if putin has a hand up trump 's ass like a puppet . 
  one must wonder what sort of dirt he has on trump to make trump so loyal to him that he would n't mind undermining relations with literally the whole of nato . 
  one thing is clear : this little stunt benefits russia , not the united states . 
  so , that whole america first slogan can be scrapped now . 
  it has nothing to do with it . 
  it seems like `` footzz '' was trying to make a lame comparison to a non-event that no one remembers , passing it off as something as bad or embarrassing as this event involving trump and merkel . 
  not only is the former irrelevant in regards to the latter , there 's also really no comparison . 
   `` signing statements '' you 're thinking of executive orders , which still have to operate within the confines and strictures of constitutional and congressional law . 
  it 's the reason why trump 's recent `` immigration ban '' orders for certain muslim-majority countries were knocked down by the 9th circuit court ... twice !, 
  which is not a good thing for a latvian , seeing how russia is right next door . 
  hillary clinton , as secretary of state , actually did a little pr stunt of hitting a `` reset '' button with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov . 
  for context , that was before the crimea debacle and sanctions in 2014 . 
  it also obviously does n't change the fact that trump is an idiot and obama was a reasonable diplomat . 
  not the best , but leagues above the current administration ( although tillerson seems far more competent than trump , if only because he was a real executive , not a play one , and does n't suffer from narcissistic personality disorder like our immature commander-in-chief ) . 
  as far as an eventual impeachment goes , even republicans have constituencies to worry about . 
  trump rode to the white house on a wave of populism . 
  that wave of populism could very well be blunted by good ole american nationalism/xenophobia aimed at russia should that narrative continue to dominate the news cycle . 
  people listening to alex jones and rush limbaugh all day wo n't know much about what 's going on , but that 's not the majority of the country . 
  that was a painful lesson learned with the failure of the new gop healthcare bill in congress , in an attempt to replace the now very popular `` obamacare '' legislation ( i.e. 
  affordable care act ) . 
  `` you ca n't fool all the people all the time . '', 
  i shit you not , he actually tried to sue them a few years ago . 
  a satirical `` news '' site . 
  for libel . 
  lol . 
  i think it has more to do with narcissism , or more aptly narcissistic personality disorder ( hence the immaturity ) , mixed with his general ignorance about the world and how it works . 
  essentially , the us does not equal nato , yet he somehow thinks that this is the case . 
  or perhaps he knows better and he 's just doing this as a lap dog for putin to show daddy that he 's a good doggie and can undermine nato for him . 
  well , that 's news to me ( i see that article was just published today ) , so i will retract my previous point . 
  do n't try to obfuscate things . 
  tillerson does n't need to meet with china 's president xi at all , because the latter is meeting trump at mar-a-lago . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're aware of it , but the president of the united states and his secretary of state can be in two different places at the same time . 
  this is a clear snub to our nato allies , to meet with not just china but russia before them when it is entirely possible for tillerson to be at the nato talks . 
  reuters on the issue : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-tillerson-iduskbn16s04i, 
  you 're being too cynical and some of your assertions are simply wrong . 
  although the united states ' republic was revolutionary , it was not born in a vacuum . 
  democracy was invented by the ** ancient greeks ** . 
  the first articles of the united states constitution were very much influenced by the ** english bill of rights ** passed in 1689 , influenced by political philosophers such as ** john locke ** ( died 1704 ) . 
  likewise , the french philosopher ** voltaire ** ( died 1778 ) advocated for the freedom of religion , freedom of speech , and separation of church and state , which profoundly impacted the later republican ** french revolution ** of 1789 . 
  it 's almost as if you were n't aware of the entire enlightenment of the western world before you made this post of yours . 
  even when most of europe was still ruled by monarchies , there were some europeans who advocated ideas that are very much a core part of our modern democratic values and had a direct impact on the aforementioned republican revolutions . 
  as for the rule of law , that 's an even older precedent observed and upheld by the ancient romans , byzantines , and in many cases the medieval europeans . 
  the flowering of ** renaissance italy ** comes to mind , and even before that they had the medieval maritime republics such as pisa , venice and genoa , let alone florence . 
  these served as models for later republics , as did the ** dutch republic ** of the 16th century . 
  it seems eerily similar to donald trump 's secretary of state rex tillerson skipping that nato meeting to visit russia and putin first . 
  it seems as though putin is getting all of his ducks lined up in a row . 
  edit : someone has pointed out a brand new reuters article out today explaining how they 've rescheduled talks so that tillerson can meet with the heads of nato before he goes to russia . 
  i think he 's talking about the rule of law , universal rights , democracy , freedom of the press , that sort of thing , while excluding stuff like fascism , totalitarianism , ultra-nationalism , colonialism , pseudoscience and biological racism , etc. 
  god save the queen !!!!!!!!!!, 
  remember , remember , the 5th of november , gunpowder plot and treason ( guy fawkes was a muslim , right ? 
  thanks for letting me know !, 
  actually , the current borders of the `` republic of macedonia '' are n't located within ancient illyria , which is more contiguous with modern-day albania . 
  it is centered in what used to be the kingdom of paeonia , which was annexed by the kingdom of macedon during the reign of antigonos ii in the mid 3rd century bc . 
  it still looks so medieval , in some ways late roman/byzantine . 
  and that particular type of conical pine tree : what 's the exact specie of it ? 
  they 're so typical of the mediterranean in general . 
  i 'd refrain from calling it a dark age , but yes , things were very bleak in italy following the byzantine reconquest . 
  relatively speaking it was n't that large , considering the devastation on eastern mediterranean demographics following the plague of justinian . 
  this in turn affected the economy of the entire region , which took a nose dive for a while . 
  the ultimate consequence was that the byzantines were generally poorer , less populated , and not always able to muster enough troops for their expansive borders . 
  this at a time when they had dramatically expanded westward to reclaim territories of the fallen western roman empire and hence needed to garrison far-flung areas of the western mediterranean . 
  the roman empire under marcus aurelius withstood the antonine plague as well , but it was able to recuperate much faster than the byzantines , since the roman empire was still united in its entirety and hence still had an enormous domestic economy as a tax base to refurbish the army . 
  i know that it 's hard to be inclusive of every single era in a single map , but this is almost a tad bit misleading . 
  charles v , king of spain was also holy roman emperor who controlled territories in italy , germany , and the netherlands when hernan cortes toppled the aztec empire in what is now mexico . 
  at one point , during the reign of charles v , the spanish empire not only consisted of much of the americas and small parts of asia and north africa , but also much of continental europe . 
  they would have controlled even more , arguably , had it not been for the contentious wars with the kingdom of france . 
  good point . 
  his party made gains enough to hold 20 seats . 
  but given the overall amount of seats in parliament , does n't that mean his party will be ignored while others form coalitions ? 
  sorry , i 'm an american , so i do n't know too much about this . 
  lol . 
  your flag says `` bromania . '', 
  i 've been to a similar place ( lol ) called * romania * before , brasov to be specific . 
  lovely `` black '' church there . 
  a lovely church that trump apparently ca n't rule out will face nuclear annihilation if , you know , `` negotiation '' goes bad over `` there '' in that nebulous place called europe . 
  nah , dude , youtube is worse . 
  way worse . 
  by an order of magnitude . 
  i totally agree , with the caveat that i 've seen a good number of right-wing europeans praising and trolling on his behalf in various forums . 
  he has apparently emboldened them as well , although this has so far failed to materialize with political consequences . 
  for instance , wilders just got routed in the dutch elections . 
   ireland is german now ? 
  awesome . 
  eu objective # 389 is now complete . 
  :d now brussels can move on to the tricky business of forming a federal eu army . 
  someone literally had to explain to trump why it 's not cool to just use nuclear weapons whenever he feels like it . 
   i confused a couple of american friends when i told them that italy is younger than the usa i was always interested in the historical fantasy of giuseppe garibaldi coming to the us during the american civil war to help the union in an advisory or command role , as a gesture of thanks for some of the material support offered by the us in the risorgimento . 
  plus garibaldi lived in the us for a while . 
  some of his officers and former compatriots even served in the union army during the war . 
  he also wrote a letter to abraham lincoln congratulating him on the emancipation proclamation regarding african slaves . 
  ironically , some italians originally from the army of the two sicilies , who had fought against garibaldi , also fought in the american civil war on the side of the confederacy .
