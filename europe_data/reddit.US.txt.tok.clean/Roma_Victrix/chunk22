  fbi : excuse me , who 's in charge here ?

  nelson : [ not anymore i 'm not !,

  i see what you did there . 
  that said , pythagoras was quite a prankster . 
  not a big surprise , really , considering the cult/secret society he built up around himself . 
  have a happy woodland critter christmas , italy . 
  sincerely , murica, 
  cool !, 
  thanks for letting me know . 
  i 'll have to check it out . 
  these are latin terms for each of these nationalities , so yes , angli is most certainly the english . 
  as for modern cultures , well , any one of them that stresses wearing a veil . 
  i 'm sure you know which ones still do that !, 
  notice how the greeks are dressed almost like turks , because ottomans . 
  sounds about right . 
  thanks wahhabis !, 
  the syrian refugee crisis and isis are the driving factors for much of this , even though the guy was tunisian . 
  the caliphate knows no borders , though , and is allegedly universal for `` real '' muslims ( i.e. 
  not those shia or ibadi heretics ) . 
  it means `` asshole '' in italian . 
  he might be a target for the crazies , but he 's also going to be famous and have everyone buy him drinks forever . 
  it 's a mixed bag , but i 'd be happily taking those free drinks . 
  thank you for the random comment !, 
  does n't `` stronzoni '' also work ? 
  i was being slightly hyperbolic . 
  usually , however , in american culture when you buy a girl a cup of coffee it means you 're interested in her and looking for a real date . 
  that explains things . 
  thanks for the link . 
  buy you a cappuccino instead ? 
  wait . 
  never mind . 
  that looks gay among two grown men . 
  um ... i 'll buy you a beer , a peroni ? 
  thanks for the correction !, 
  well , this could have happened a number of different ways . 
  he could have still had his papers on him and , when approached , he could have been subdued and detained before firing a shot at police . 
  that 's not an insanely unlikely scenario , is it ? 
  i understand completely why he was shot , though , because he was armed and dangerous and had just wounded one officer . 
  law-abiding sweetheart indeed . 
  that 's easy to say when you 're not being fired upon at point blank range . 
  the guy was armed and dangerous , and wounded an officer before being killed . 
  it 's really sad how these kids are being indoctrinated . 
  they do n't have much of a choice in the matter . 
  lol . 
  guy was a real `` stronzo '' if you know what i 'm saying . 
  i give italy 5 stars . 
  he also did n't have his id papers on him , which is the reason he started shooting at the officers in the first place . 
  his id and paperwork were stupidly left in the truck that he used to kill people in berlin . 
  if the italians had his paperwork , you can be damn sure they would have neutered him . 
  christian movio was wounded while officer luca scata neutralized him . 
  well done , milan pd !, 
  thanks !, 
  i read indirectly from * the guardian * that * reuters * says they have the fingerprints of the guy . 
  it 's him . 
  job well done by milan pd , particularly luca scata who shot him , and christian movio who was wounded . 
  free drinks for life at restaurants and bars , no doubt !, 
  how do you say `` drinks are on the house '' in italian ? 
  [ stalin approves !, 
  good job on the german police , and the australian police for that matter , who just busted up ** [ a major christmas-time terrorist operation . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-38411935 ) ** this shit does n't end , does it ? 
  and of course they attack on or around christmas , because nothing is sacred . 
  it 's also meaningless for them , if not an insult to islam that people celebrate something else so brazenly !, 
  yep . 
  no vasco de gamo without a fisherman 's roots !, 
  no wonder the generic southern european general in * medieval ii : total war * always included in his battle speeches against the kingdom of portugal : `` these portuguese are fishermen , not soldiers ! '', 
  lol . 
  yeah , but it 's no secret that the manufacturing base , financial institutions , and commercial hubs are located in northern italy , not southern italy . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but southern italy relies heavily on tourism to make up for this fact . 
  probably does n't help that the mafia is around to squeeze and pinch business owners that do n't offer them regular monetary tribute . 
  that 's a good way to go bankrupt or never significantly expand . 
  dark lord sauron is displeased with this paltry offering and has therefore sent in ** [ a terrifying new weapon of beer ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/06/c4/88/06c48816d7bc38946d680184eb81a73c.jpg ) ** to punish the free peoples of middle america . 
  perhaps then a larger coca-cola christmas tree can be arranged . 
  i was unaware that bacalhau was even consumed on christmas over there in portugal . 
  til . 
  of all these companies i think the southernmost location is florence ( i.e. 
  gucci , the fashion and luxury brand ) . 
  however , the map above is slightly odd for including lazio and rome as part of the `` doomed south '' ... rome is perhaps one of the biggest centers in italy for corporate headquarters , including the major national italian airline companies . 
  it 's also a huge financial hub that rivals milan . 
  all roads led to * somewhere * , but for the life of me i ca n't remember ... oh yeah !, 
  naples . 
  that 's the one . 
   they wo n't get the satisfaction of winning . 
  you 're right . 
  only charlie sheen will hold that satisfaction .
