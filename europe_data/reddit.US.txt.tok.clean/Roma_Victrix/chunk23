  that makes sense now . 
  pigmentation , perhaps ? 
  that actually makes a great deal of sense . 
  it is also specifically a sunni phenomenon , considering how countries like ibadi-majority oman have n't produced a single isis terrorist . 
  we are n't seeing a wave of lebanese or iranian shia muslim terrorism in europe . 
  seems pretty fucking basic to me .

  well , that 's because the roman empire , building on the legacy of ancient greece and greeks of the mediterranean world , defined what was western and what was n't western for more than a millennia . 
  ptolemaic egypt was a hellenistic country ( with only a minority ethnic greek/macedonian population , but pretty much greek in culture ) before it was taken by the romans in the age of octavian/augustus . 
  the territorial definition of `` the west '' has changed over time significantly , and following rome 's conversion to christianity basically matched up with the socio-political realm of christendom during the middle ages/early modern era , stretching all the way to cyprus after the loss of the levantine crusader states . 
  yet egypt was a majority christian country when it was taken by the arabs and remained majority coptic christian well into the middle ages . 
  the boundaries of `` the west '' were greatly expanded with european colonization , particularly with the spanish , french , portuguese , and english colonies ( although some people love to exclude latin america from `` the west '' despite the cultural affinities ) . 
  it eventually evolved into a cold war terminology to demarcate who was aligned with the soviet union or the united states . 
  now these former eastern bloc countries joining the eu are slowing being considered part of the west , based on the shared cultural legacy of being a part of christendom . 
  surely you are aware of all this . 
  mind you , non-christian majority countries of europe like albania and turkey have joined nato , yet this is merely a sign of the growing maturity of international affairs , which are no longer completely bogged down by sectarian religious hatred . 
  admission into nato , however , is more about common defense than it is about a shared system of values like the eu . 
  and with brexit , obviously admission into the eu is not the defining characteristic of a western country , otherwise norway and switzerland would n't be considered western ( to say nothing of the anglophone countries outside of europe , the usa , canada , new zealand , and australia ) . 
  the ole divide and conquer strategy ...

  forgot about our dear heraclitus . 
  well , for what it 's worth , he is a prophet in their religion . 
  just saying . 
  they do n't deny him so much as relegate him as one of many prophets before muhammad , and do n't believe he is the `` son '' of god/trinity thing .

  where did i say the word `` christianity ? '', 
  that 's all you , buddy . 
  in either case the caliphate was just as happy to swallow up majority christian territories of the eastern roman empire as they were the majority zoroastrian and pagan lands of the sasanian empire . 
  same with sogdia in central asia ( pagan , zoroastrian , buddhist , manichaean ) , the northern half of india ( majority hindu ) , and xinjiang in northwest china ( majority buddhist ) . 
  the peoples of these territories were considered infidels , period , even lower than the `` people of the book '' inhabiting western europe at the time . 
  outside of the islamic civil wars ( the * fitnas * ) , i 'd say the conflicts the islamic world had with the western world did far more to define the cultural and political boundaries of that part of the globe , especially the crusades . 
  yet that was only part of it ; the continued wars with the crown of castile and republic of venice should n't be forgotten . 
  these were the primary enemies of the islamic world , generally speaking , not the ming dynasty of china , for instance . 
  however , i suppose the ottoman empire considered the safavid empire of persia a greater threat than , say , the distant holy roman empire ruled by the habsburgs , even though the two were at war from time to time . 
  the ottoman-safavid conflict was also drawn along religious sectarian lines , considering the sunni faith of the ottoman turks and shia faith of the persians .

  no , the eastern romans lost the levant in its entirety by the end of the 640s . 
  it was only partially recovered in the 12th century , during the komnenian dynasty and initial phase of the crusades . 
  even that was pretty fleeting for the byzantines , considering how the empire was broken and put on life support with the sack of constantinople in the fourth crusade and establishment of the decades-long latin empire in former byzantine territory . 
  you 're correct , however , in the assertion that the byzantines and sasanians were weakened by the wars they fought with each other , just before the arabs invaded . 
  the sasanian persians invaded egypt , the levant , and anatolia before the arabs . 
  it went both ways , though , considering the roman/byzantine forays into mesopotamia . 
  lol !, 
  his name was heraclius . 
  heraclitus sounds like some greek porn star actress 's name . 
  not a bad idea , actually . 
  nope . 
  ( byzantine ) roman egypt was invaded by the rashidun caliphate under umar in 639 ad and the conquest was completed with the capture of alexandria in 641 ad . 
  you 're probably thinking of the byzantine recapture of the city of alexandria alone in 645 ad , yet they were driven out the following year . 
  this marked the end of more than six centuries of roman rule in egypt . 
  see timothy power 's * the red sea from byzantium to the caliphate * ( oxford university press , 2012 ) , although you could refer to a great deal of other works for that matter . 
  it 's fairly common knowledge as far as global history goes . 
  actually , it began in earnest in about 632 following the death of muhammad . 
  it was his rashidun caliph successors abu bakr and umar who expanded the caliphate at the expense of the eastern roman and sasanian empires .
