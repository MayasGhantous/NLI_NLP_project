  by the time of umar 's death in 644 , the eastern roman empire had lost the entire levant ( syria , judea , palestine ) , egypt , and parts of libya and anatolia ( i.e. 
  modern eastern turkey ) . 
  just read ** [ a mirror.co.uk article ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/terror-attack-feared-berlin-lorry-9486771 ) ** that confirmed at least one death . 
  `` 9 ways to divide sweden '' * ^ putin ^ intensifies *, 
  `` divide the netherlands '' * ^ putin ^ intensifies *, 
  from a swedish point of view , fish-related things should have been at the very top of the list !, 
  for shame !, 
  he even looks like an asshole in his portrait bust too . 
  it 's as if dethklok took over huge swaths of eastern europe . 
  i bet her husband will be more inclined to divorce this airhead at this point . 
  `` only , that 's not snow ... '' cocaine then , maybe ? 
  it 's the [ `` birds and the bees '' talk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_birds_and_the_bees ) , lithuanian style . 
  russia is n't far behind lithuania here , though . 
  jesus , what the hell is wrong with hungary ? 
  it seems like a great chunk of the ole eastern bloc is a great big suicide zone . 
  that 's upsetting . 
  have n't they gone through enough shit ? 
  i guess that explains things . 
  lol . 
  that 's supposed to represent a baby ? 
  i 'm so confused . 
  there 's the christmas spirit !, 
  father christmas burst through the door with his sled , shotgun in hand , shouted `` room service mother fucker '' in portuguese and took shit over like a fucking boss . 
  the three wise men barely managed to escape . 
  all others were slaughtered by santa 's elves ( on mercenary leave from the north pole ) wielding tec-9s . 
  baby jesus was made a mere figurehead thereafter . 
  quite the opposite : i think it 's exactly what you hope for . 
  and daddy christmas is going to sit you right in his lap , too . 
  lol . 
  seriously , though , `` daddy christmas '' sounds like a porno flick . 
  and globalization taught you rightly that babies are incapable of such things . 
  also , silly greece for choosing saint basil of caesarea over saint nicholas . 
  bend the knee and bow to santa claus or be destroyed , oh hellenic republic . 
  this is your last warning . 
  we 'll finish the job the venetians did with the parthenon ( now that donald trump is president of the us this potential threat is perhaps very real if you convinced him that an isis outpost was located there ) . 
  also , do n't feel too bad that you thought baby jesus brought gifts . 
  those catalans are taking some serious magic mushrooms or something for thinking that a christmas log brings them gifts . 
  if someone told me that with a straight face i 'd register them with an insane asylum . 
  good englishman . 
  you stick it to those sheep shaggers for this grave and profound insult only a perfidious welshman would conceive . 
  yeah , but everyone loves pizza , so despite its origins in italy and italians ' zeal for pizza , i could easily say the same thing about germans ( for instance , i 've had some of the best pizza i 've ever had in munich ) . 
  you should have said something about obesity , ignorance of geography , or getting shot in the classroom . 
  do n't worry ... you 'll get the hang of it , you cappuccino-drinking , fashion-designing , ferrari-driving , pasta-engorging , opera-going dagowop . 
  yeah , * forgetaboutit !, 
  * seriously , though , forget about it , because i basically exhausted all the italian stereotypes that i 'm aware of , minus the mafia thing . 
  i came here to watch greeks and turks getting into an argument as usual , but i was disappointed . 
  perhaps it 's also a cathartic and pleasant surprise . 
  perhaps the world is becoming a better place !, 
  that being said , we already knew about the whole oil trade thing . 
  even assad 's government was engaging in this somewhat recently : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/25/isils-deal-with-bashar-al-assad-and-the-40m-a-month-oil-profits/, 
  i do n't know if you can generalize about americans ' taste for dark humor based on my individual opinion that holocaust jokes are usually not cool . 
  i mean , have you seen the * eric andre show ? 
  * or just about any dave attell standup show . 
  or for that matter any new york standup comic talking about their personal demons and heroin addiction . 
  how very true . 
  it works both ways , unfortunately . 
  this is the sad limitation of our stupid primate brains . 
  ` pikeys ' , or so i 've heard from the movie * snatch * . 
  wow . 
  at first this banter was funny . 
  now it just got ugly . 
  they 're basically at war with factual information . 
  damn you , * the onion !, 
  * damn you all to hell !, 
  ^ ^ * this ^ ^ comment ^ ^ is ^ ^ brought ^ ^ to ^ ^ you ^ ^ by ^ ^ cnn . 
  it 's a good thing the romans romanized you bunch of heathens , shepherds , javelin-chuckers , and fishmongers . 
  welcome to the district of columbia . 
  also , [ fort ticonderoga ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/61/33/f9/6133f9ca069930842b830c475fd6c1df.jpg ) in the us , 18th century , new york state . 
  that only lasted for two years and was replaced with the current flag bearing the stars that represent the states . 
  having red and white stripes representing the thirteen colonies turned states was also unique to the us , although i 'll admit that the earlier british east india company flag was quite similar ( albeit with a number of stripes ranging from 9 to 15 , not always 13 ) . 
  in either case there were no british flags with stars representing colonies , counties , territories , or any other type of governed region in the british empire . 
  red , white , and blue were also the colors of the british union jack , after the combination of the flags of scotland and england in the early 17th century during the reign of james vi of scotland ( who was also james i of england ) . 
  we americans borrowed the colors but made an entirely new design with stars that represented the new states , which were the original english colonies , of course . 
  i was under the impression that it was something over 50 % now . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  i 'm well aware of that , but is n't it a slight majority who now speak french ? 
  hence my reference to demographics . 
  you guys have had belgium for a while now , demographically speaking . 
  ** [ you danes ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fyc9f2j4jjm/hqdefault.jpg ) ** are going to have to assemble into a mighty host of horse and man to put a stop to this dutch scourge from the lowlands . 
   the entire population of egypt the vast , vast majority , but not the * entirety * of the population . 
  you 're forgetting the mediterranean coast closer to libya , the red sea coast , and the sinai peninsula . 
   fuck these comments . 
  of course they are all from ignorant ass americans who do n't realize that a large proportion of people in the europe directly or indirectly lost family members , friends and loved ones due to concentration camps . 
  hmm ... are you beating up a strawman here ? 
  i 've seen one , maybe two posters here who are americans and do n't get it that this is how the european mindset is . 
  i 've seen way more american posters here more or less agreeing with everyone else . 
  that being said , in germany you should respect the laws of that country , or simply choose not to visit . 
  it 's that simple . 
  and i understand their cultural sensitivities . 
  that said , for my own country , given our enshrined first amendment of the us constitution that guarantees freedom of speech , i think people should be able to make fools of themselves and do the nazi salute all day if the like . 
  it 's their own reputation that they 're roasting . 
  in fact , we go a bit further and actually allow a real nazi party . 
  it 's a small , sad , and marginalized political party , and it more or less serves as the butt of jokes and something not taken very seriously . 
  germany 's still doing pretty well in terms of crime statistics and perhaps they integrate their small minority communities better than other nations . 
  meanwhile , france ( and by extension belgium ) , with ~ 10 % of its population being muslim/people of middle-eastern or north african heritage , is having problems with both petty crime and periodic terrorism . 
  the fatalities from terrorism in that country were ridiculously high in the 1970s thanks to marxist terrorists like carlos the jackal . 
  however , things would be far peachier if certain immigrants and french-born muslims were n't engaging in acts of terrorism these days . 
  charlie hebdo should have been a wake-up call for french authorities , but since then they 've had the bataclan massacre and tons of men , women , and children run over by jihadis driving trucks . 
  the islamic state ( isis ) is also driving a lot of this nonsense with their millenarian doomsday cult preaching that they are the only holy , legitimate government on earth and everyone else outside of their charming caliphate is a heathen in need of conversion or death ( third option if you 're lucky : slavery ) . 
  isis obviously does n't have a chance in hell of standing up to real military powers , not even turkey , but they are able to convince a whole host of sunni muslim youth these days to follow their salafi cause .
