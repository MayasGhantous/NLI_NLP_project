yeah , we already know that germany is new turkey . 
  eni has a very nice logo . 
  so much better than gazprom and bp . 
  oh , it 's derived from greek . 
  that 's different then . 
  probably should have paid more attention . 
  greek root is the same - meaning a passageway . 
  edit : in fact [ \u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1 in greek is actually derived from latin and it means door . 
  ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%cf%80%cf%8c%cf%81%cf%84%ce%b1#greek ), 
  actually , [ porta in latin ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/porta#latin ) could mean gate especially one to a city , as opposed to its descendant meaning door or gate in italian . 
  they also controlled bari for around 25 years . 
  that was their only permanent possession on mainland italy . 
  plus there were raids on pretty much every coastal city . 
  [ haplogroups . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup ) has to do with genetics . 
  the combining forms \u0565\u0580\u056f\u0578 - ( erko - ) and \u0565\u0580\u056f\u056b - ( erki - ) go back to proto-indo-european * dwo - and * dwi - , respectively . 
  the unusual development of proto-indo-european * dw - into \u0565\u0580\u056f - ( erk - ) in armenian has been extensively discussed ; there is no universally accepted explanation . 
  see \u0565\u0580\u056f\u0576 ( erkn ) and \u0565\u0580\u056f\u0561\u0580 ( erkar ) for more examples of the change . 
  yeah , the author sappho is from lesbos . 
  many of her poems are said to have had sexual connotations towards other women . 
  also , many women are said to have moved to lesbos to become her disciple . 
  unfortunately very little of her works survive , not a single complete work , only small fragments . 
   they probably only see it as a competitor . 
  do n't you just see it from an economic point ? 
  you want to : * stop the boats * ensure eni has gas, 
  that 's a bit much . 
  there 's two major competing libyan governments why not just directly support one ? 
  technically the eu + us already are . 
  simply step up your support to them - help them to sort their shit out . 
  ultimately , regardless of what happens it 's not wise to have a european power directly ruling over the action . 
  if italy does something it should be done along with egypt , tunisia , and algeria . 
  the last thing you want to do is add fire to the idea of crusading european states . 
  it sounds dumb , yes , yet people fall for this propaganda . 
   `` lex retro non agit '' [ i think the rest of the world calls them ** ex post facto ** laws which is latin for `` after the fact '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ex_post_facto_law ) same basic idea , though . 
  not sure if the danes have laws like it , if they do wikipedia does n't mention it . 
  oh , german action was pretty deplorable . 
  the schlieffen plan was outdated and just not a good idea . 
  but they caused the escalation . 
  the alliances were already in place . 
  everybody was aligned . 
  russia was aligned with france and britain they would have joined regardless . 
  but once again , they did n't start the war ; a myriad of all ready in place causes initiated by the assassination did . 
   that 's new  intended to be so absurd you 'd out right reject it . 
   the question of guilt may not be as simply answered as in ww2 but just as there the answer to the question of who started it is : germany no . 
  what is the single action that ignited everything in europe and started everything - the assassination . 
  russia had a treaty with serbia , austria-hungary had a treaty with germany . 
  they 're all equally at fault here . 
  even when you google it this is what they gives you :  with the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand and his wife on june 28th , 1914 , austria-hungary was able to secure the promise from germany that it would aid in a war with serbia and possibly russia , if russia chose to enter the fray due to their treaty with serbia.dec 10 , 2010 there is a lot which contributed but the assassination is what actually did it . 
  which is why , like i said , we learn maniac . 
  all contributing factors . 
   germany was not a victim in this conflict . 
  it was a , if not the , escalating factor . 
  i said that . 
  they were the major player , they even escalated it - but they did n't start it . 
  the alliance already existed , they had an obligation to follow the conditions in the alliance . 
  now nothing would have happened had they not , italy did n't , but they chose to follow their agreements . 
  they did not , however , start it . 
  and as i recall , austria-hungary gave serbia ( and technically russia ) an ultimatum to avoid war . 
  so i could easily say it was them , serbia , who started the war . 
  i 'm not a german apologist . 
  i just like my history to be as accurate as possible . 
  the assassination of austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand is the action which officially started wwi . 
  then you have you alliances , etc. 
  in u.s. schools we are taught the acronym maniac - ** m ** ilitarization , ** a ** lliances , ** n ** ationalism , ** i ** mperialism , ** a ** ssassination , and the ** c ** risis in the balkans . 
  when discussing the treaty of versailles we also discussed who started the war . 
  germany may have been the major player , but they did not start it . 
  ** edit : ** fixed from austrian-hungarian to austro-hungarian . 
   here we have a country , that is barely united and already has started two major human tragedies . 
  did you just blame germany for wwi ? 
  there 's a lot wrong with your post yet this irks me the most . 
  germany did n't start wwi . 
  everyone is jealous of us . 
   likes to destroy italian fountains . 
  ftfy, 
  american culture known the world around . 
  makes me proud . 
  [ probably fans of the tiny toons version . 
  sung by they might be giants . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsqrkzcytqg ) sped up and a bit more catchy . 
   how many years has it been since you have been dangling that eu membership carrot ? 
  how much of the acquis have you met ? 
  how many chapters have you closed ? 
  more info : english peon is from the spanish * pe\u00f3n * , itself -  from late latin ped\u014d , ped\u014dnem ( `` footsoldier '' ) , from latin p\u0113s , pedem ( `` foot '' ) . 
  compare portuguese pe\u00e3o , french pion , italian pedone . 
  a recursive country name ? 
  i like it . 
  there was troops on the ground !? 
  as far as i was aware it was just bombing during an already started civil war . 
  mind you bombing coordinated with rebellious ground forces , but bombing nevertheless . 
  hardly counts as an invasion . 
  do n't get ahead of yourself !, 
  the us joins in when the war becomes stagnant and saves the day . 
  we take all the credit . 
  france will surrender . 
  poland will get destroyed . 
  italy will switch sides . 
  france invaded libya ? 
  * really ? 
   stop invading these north african countries in the first place .
