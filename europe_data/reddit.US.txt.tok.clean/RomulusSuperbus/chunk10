  italy is preventing india from joining certain organizations over i maro ' and the enrica lexie case . 
  every now and then people say this shit about california . 
  california is rich primarily from silicon valley and their fantastic universities . 
  except the universities major point is that they get government support and contracts . 
  nasa will leave california if they secede and with that comes the thousands of great minds . 
  new york would quickly replace california if they left . 
   ever heard of hyperbole ? 
  northerners are so mean to neapolitans , can you blame me ? 
  especially the milanese . 
  you 're probably right . 
  like * it 's all greek to me * ? 
  i do n't think that 's what he meant . 
   i ca n't understand shit of spoken sicilian and neapolitan . 
  some dialects down there sound like arabic to me . 
  they absolutely do not sound like arabic . 
  have you ever actually heard arabic ? 
  compare : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1qjwhwvgp8 with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgobbhqqcau -- also if you familiarize yourself with certain linguistic principles , and certain shifts that occurred in the romance languages , you can better get an understanding of all the romance languages , not just the italo-dalmatian or the gallo-italic ones . 
  officially , there is no real criteria to determine the difference between a language and a dialect . 
  when you think about it would be pretty hard to establish ; you 're just supposed to use your better judgement . 
  reconstructions of the ancient roman senate put it as `` trenches '' too . 
   indiscriminately calling those who back circumcision of male children ( i.e. 
  jews and muslims ) `` barbaric '' does make you a racist . 
  did n't call them barbaric . 
  i called the practice barbaric . 
   i 've never seen a claim that someone still spoke celtic once the empire fell . 
  they most likely still did but it was n't widespread . 
  especially out side of metropolitan centers languages tend to hold on hard . 
  brittonic was still spoken after the fall of rome . 
  phoenician was still spoken after the fall of rome , some say all the way up until the muslim conquests . 
  language is one of those things that are hard to get rid of . 
  prior to mass communication , movement , and education . 
  the issue is we can only know what was written . 
  north african writers mention berber and phoenician . 
  not many norici were writing about the people there . 
  bilingualism was probably common . 
  particularly on mountains and hard to reach areas where rome 's grasps never were 100 % - like basque county . 
  etruscan was spoken well into the roman period , emperor claudius being the ( edit : ** last ** ) person known for sure to have knowledge . 
  he wrote works on it and mentioned , that while rare , there are still speakers . 
  unfortunately the treatises he wrote on it are completely lost so the language is only known by about 1000 words . 
  in modern italy , over a century after unification , after rai 's use in teaching the populace italian , after a huge movement by mussolini . 
  still !, 
  the majority of italians ( ~ 56 % ) do not use italian at home , preferring their regional language , and even some monolinguals are out there . 
  and italy is 156 years old and has the benefit of universal education , literacy , and media . 
   even though this is just another religious bullshit , do n't go calling other people 's culture barbaric , because it 's not , and doing so only demonstrates your inability to think broadly and understand the diversity of human societies . 
  shitty argument . 
  can i call the practices of papuan new guinea cannibals barabaric ? 
  hindu brain-eating tribes ? 
  the aztecs slicing out the still-beating hearts of their civilians ? 
  the inca sacrificing their children on mountain tops ? 
  and for closer to home examples - woman in the middle east . 
  is that barbaric ? 
  what i ca n't call barbaric is the origin of these practices . 
  that 's all part of understanding the human condition and the diversity of people . 
  i can absolutely call the fact that they are still practiced barbaric . 
  especially if it 's a hold over from centuries or millenia ago . 
   if you 've been circumcised and suffer from it then yeah , just fight against it . 
  if you 've only watched viral videos on social networks then frankly , just go watch other videos . 
  i do n't live in north korea so i should n't be bothered by the authoritarian state ? 
  i 'm not a woman so i ca n't support woman 's suffrage ? 
  i should just watch other videos , eh ? 
  body autonomy is a human right . 
   apparently us soldiers introduced the practice christian missionaries had a bigger hand than gis . 
  it was already fairly widespread at the time of the korean war . 
  but during the war it became a sure thing . 
  also , there are various stories , not quite sure about the accuracy , that some soldiers managed to get trench foot on their penises . 
  might apply more for vietnam . 
   `` i do n't think we are giving them places at the expense of others who are in need , and that 's the real point here . 
  they are going through rigorous checks in calais to ensure that they are of the age that they ought to be to fall within the legislation . 
  ** now , one or two may slip through the net ** , i do n't deny ... ''  ** `` 2/3 slip through the net according to the home office '' ** -- jesus christ . 
  and she knew that because she then clarified the numbers . 
  she 's flat out lying on television . 
  this is plainly propaganda . 
  refugee laws were written in a radically different time and are today being abused . 
  so , no , it 's not legal . 
  but who enforces international treaties ? 
  who writes them ? 
  they need to be rewritten . 
  rather than defending them maybe change the conversation to attacking and changing them . 
   yeah , there are options , like you americans taking responsibility for global warming and apply the paris agreement . 
  yes , america is the only country responsible for global warming . 
  i agree that climate change is gon na cause a massive migration and it 's too late to reverse all of it but right now is when we should be working on mitigating it . 
  right now . 
  with that being said , when these people do start mass migrating is italy gon na pick them all up ? 
  the current influx is unbearable , what happens it 's multiple times larger ? 
   oh , and the us exports evangelical missionaries in africa preaching , among the other things , how wonderful breeding is . 
  yeah this is pretty messed up . 
  of course the vatican is doing the exact same thing . 
  maybe the lateran treaties were n't such a good idea . 
  maybe francis should be the next prigioniero del vaticano . 
   ah yes , the `` we follow the law when it suits us '' argument . 
  no , the * humans write laws , humans can change them * argument . 
   if a country thinks the laws are stupid , all a country needs to do is simply withdraw from the relevant treaties . 
  that would at least be consistent and then in the case where one of their boats is sinking we can let them drown with a clear conscience . 
  exactly . 
  do n't let them drown but change the qualifications to actually acquire refugee status . 
  punish , actually punish , the countries who refuse to take back their citizens . 
  cut welfare , and en masse deport to make it absolutely clear that the voyage is not a good idea . 
   the best way to prevent this problem is stabilise libya , and stop fucking up the rest of the continent . 
  i have no dispute here . 
  italy and , to a lesser extent , the eu are trying to stabilize it but you have competing claims of government .
