  when was the last time that we did ? 
  suez canal crisis maybe ? 
   if they 're going to wait for others to take the lead they can wait a long time . 
  from what i 've read , they have no problem taking the lead but only after being clearly requested from libya . 
  they want local support before rushing in there . 
   superman just flied away flew * flied really is n't a word except in sports . 
  so if nt is d how do you make the nt sound ? 
   \u03bd\u03c4 this is d , right ? 
  because delta has shifted to be pronounced as hard th ? 
   spanish/portuguese are closer to its latin origins even though italian is the closest one out of the major romance languages to latin . 
  that 's not entirely true . 
  caseus is classical latin for cheese , but the vulgar latin form is formaticus . 
  in this case spanish/portuguese derive their word for cheese from classical latin whereas italian takes it from vulgar . 
  however , standard italian does have a variant form of cacio . 
  in addition , region italian languages have forms derived from caseus as well . 
  caciu in sicilian , casu in sardinian , etc. 
  i also read that lexical distance for catalan is closer with italian than with spanish , but i 'm not too sure . 
   implies some kind of substantial , quantitative ` distance ' . 
  [ the wikipedia article covers this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_distance ) then again , it 's wikipedia , so the accuracy may not be spot on . 
   does it improve less than if i had studied italian ? 
  no , i think it improves more . 
  italian is closer to latin in bulk word origin . 
  it 'll give you better command over the romance languages . 
  in addition , french and italian take a lot from each other . 
   finnish is n't even indo-european ; i do n't get that either . 
  they put it at the max for distancing . 
  so maybe it implies proto-x , or maybe they are just basing it on loan words . 
  with your other complaints i agree . 
  without knowing the source and how they compiled this it really could be very accurate or belong in the trash . 
  correct . 
  both serbian and croatian are * much * more closely related . 
  look at the thickness of the lines . 
   i do not understand a single word of albanian . 
  yeah but that does n't discount it from being related . 
  here : * dwoh ( ca n't write special characters , so it 's not exact ) is proto-indo-european . 
  in latin it 's duo , in albanian it 's dy , and in slovenian dva . 
  they all originate from the same root . 
  * meh-tr ( again , special charactersz ) is another proto-indo-european root . 
  latin mater , slovene mati , albanian mot\u00ebr ( note : albanian has shifted to mean sister instead of mother ) . 
  basically , they are n't perfectly the same . 
  but they are similar , they ** do ** originate from the same thing . 
  probably not the best examples on my part . 
  [ here 's a whole list . 
  ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:list_of_proto-indo-european_nouns ), 
  no , but it is uncommitted . 
  and given that the war was still months away , he did n't need to have been decided yet . 
  he still had time to make up his mind . 
  and he did so before the deployment of troops . 
  because it 's clearly not committed to the response leaving doubt . 
  * i guess so , maybe , perhaps * are all non-committal . 
  they leave doubt . 
  * no comment * is n't an answer , it 's avoiding the question . 
  i do n't know is also not an answer . 
  does n't sound that way to me . 
  i 'm no trump supporter but still . 
  after 9/11 emotions were relatively high and people were pissed , no one knew what should be done . 
  by time the chatter was suggesting an invasion he said no to it . 
  * i guess so * is a very non-committal answer , it means nothing . 
  it means his mind is not made up . 
  he actually addressed that . 
  according to him this was months before the invasion . 
  when the idea of an invasion was still hypothetical . 
  by time the actual invasion was going to happen he was staunchly opposed . 
  ** edit : ** months , not years ** edit 2 : ** [ found the video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33wrjfbkkiq ), 
  even without a lot of information that 's pretty cool . 
  technically they were n't getting , they were giving . 
   my grand grand dad was the head of delegates that were sent to lausanne treaty . 
  that sounds interesting . 
  any family secrets or legends you wan na share ? 
  in the interest in being fair , and although i take the greek side , the turkish argument as far as i can tell is that lausanne only names the largest islands . 
  the tiny islands with few if any people on it were n't mentioned by name but rather by geographic coordinates . 
  however , the islands that were under italian control are now under greek control . 
  if turkey had a problem when they signed the treaty they would have said something in the 20s not wait until now . 
  i 'm assuming you 're referring to a treaty with italy . 
  during the italo-turkish war italy occupied the dodecanese . 
  after italian victory italy kept the dodecanese without giving them back to the ottomans * despite * the fact that they said they would . 
  following the greco-turkish war however , according to the treaty of lausanne , turkey officially renounced all claims officially giving full ownership to italy . 
  italy lost wwii and ceded them to greece . 
  they 're unequivocally greek islands . 
  there is no issue . 
  simply follow history . 
  greek exhibits [ iotacism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iotacism ) . 
  basically their vowel pronunciation shifted to / i / for much . 
   in modern greek the letters and digraphs '' \u03b9 '' , '' \u03b7 '' , '' \u03c5 '' , '' \u03b5\u03b9 '' , '' \u03bf\u03b9 '' , '' \u03b7\u03b9 '' , '' \u03c5\u03b9 '' are all pronounced `` i '' , [ i ] . 
  of course there 's a picture of the statue in the article . 
  we ca n't look at the picture as * that which holds the image of ~ ~ an angel ~ ~ a statue becomes itself ~ ~ an angel ~ ~ a statue .

  from what i 've read asterix was only published in the us in the late 70s . 
  i probably ca n't find them in a library - but they have them online . 
  alright , i guess i 'll take a look at it . 
  it does sound like i would like it .

   ast\u00e9rix wh-what 's that ? 
  imperium refers to command not empire . 
  imperator , the word from which emperor derives ( through french ) , translates as commander . 
  many emperors took this name . 
  augustus ' name being * imper\u0101tor caesar d\u012bv\u012b f\u012blius augustus * .
