  the modern concepts of emperors and empires did n't exist back then . 
  empire is a modern term . 
  we are discussing history from the modern day . 
  principate is also a modern term , used by historians to describe the period during the roman empire when the idea was to mask the fact that they were not a republic anymore by retaining certain features of the republic , in reality it was just an illusion . 
  a lot of historical points can be debated though . 
  i can argue that wwii begins when japan invades islands in s. asia . 
  but realistically if i asked someone when the second world war began they would most likely point to september 1939 . 
  of course , but it was still a republic . 
  his actions could have been undone but they exposed deeper problems within rome . 
  it was certainly the closing period of the republic , and a period of great turmoil . 
  but historians agree that 27bc was the true starting point . 
  with the rise of caesar augustus the empire starts . 
   map of the roman empire 50bc there was no roman empire in 50bc . 
  three - auschwitz i , auschwitz ii-birkenau , and auschwitz iii-monowitz . 
  the second being the infamous concentration/extermination camp . 
   1453 which also coincides with beginnings of the renaissance . 
  technically does n't the renaissance start in the 1300s ? 
  i thought petrarch marks the beginning of the renaissance . 
  norway is in schengen . 
  sorry about that . 
  age 7 seems a bit young . 
  obviously i do n't know your specific case but for most the foreskin is really tight before puberty and then loosens as you get older . 
  and i mean that the glans is supposed to be fused to the foreskin at birth . 
  actually doctors pulling it down with to much force could hurt you and lead to phimosis . 
  i 'm gon na assume that your doctors made the right decision though , especially because you 're in europe . 
  it becomes mutilation the minute it is done without consent . 
   including lower transmission rate of sexual diseases which could easily be achieved with middle school education and a condom . 
  circumcision is not a suggested deterrent for stis outside of africa , there are other factors at play . 
   there are some moderate health benefits there are also some negatives . 
  let the person decide . 
  do n't bring factorials into this . 
  did you just write 16 in hex instead of writing 16 ? 
  [ president richard nixon begs to differ . 
  you can respect human rights and still tear down this jungle . 
  its numbers are rapidly dropping in the states . 
  while south american immigration is usually cited as the primary factor of this , many americans of european descent are also getting into it . 
  yeah , i deleted that . 
  i remembered wrong . 
  he is charged . 
  that does n't mean he is necessarily guilty . 
  please do n't make me have to defend him . 
   , there are eye witnesses who also said the african did n't initiate violence . 
  and there are witnesses that say the opposite . 
  that 's why i said * assuming * . 
  if the italian did initiate then he 's going to jail . 
  ** edit : ** innocent until guilty . 
  i went to an italian article . 
  granted , my italian is n't that great but i 'm pretty sure it said he was making fun of her , calling her a monkey , and then her husband hit him . 
  maybe even hit the italian with a road sign . 
  the italian is a boxer and hit back causing him to have a heart attack . 
   he was defending his wife who was being racially abused by the `` ultra '' . 
  with all due respect , responding to offensive words with violence is entirely inappropriate . 
  assuming the italian guy was telling the truth , the nigerian initiated the violence and is at fault here . 
  -- ** edit : ** downvoted for saying the truth . 
  google translate of [ the relevant part of the article ] ( http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/fermo-versione-dei-testimoni-i-nigeriani-hanno-aggredito-1280812.html ) :  the four witnesses , in short , all provided - separately - the same version of the facts . 
  here it is : around 15 - shows the resto del carlino - mancini would have shouted something to the nigerian wife ( do not know yet what : she says that she is called `` monkey '' , the accused have them rimbrottati `` because they were wandering suspiciously around cars '' ) . 
  subsequently , the nigerian and his wife ( who after `` insult '' had continued to walk ) would then came back . 
  the four witnesses agree that the woman would have shouted at mancini , while her husband would have pushed him and then he pulled out a pile of road signs hitting mancini and `` causing him to fall to the ground '' ( the wife says , however , that the first to use the street sign was the 39 year old italian ) . 
  four separate witnesses confirm that the nigerian initiated the violence . 
  the american government recognizes italian-american [ antonio meucci ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonio_meucci ) as the original inventor of the telephone . 
  graham bell improved upon it adding a diaphragm but is mostly still the same . 
  do n't be like that . 
  ninjas are supposed to clandestine , what 's clandestine about wearing a large black burlap sack ? 
  ah , i was n't aware about the council . 
  but still , the number of representatives and the split of power seems odd . 
  seems a bit undemocratic . 
  you should do what the us does , bicameralism . 
  one , the house , assigns representatives by population . 
  the other , the senate , assigns two senators per state . 
   this is not about a comedian with poor taste the joke did n't seem in poor taste to me . 
  it was n't funny but it was n't in poor taste either . 
   this is a politician trying to be funny with racist jokes . 
  eh , bigotry would be more accurate than racist . 
   paying thousands of lira for a can of coke due to hyperinflation was n't the smallest denomination of bills minted 1000 lire ? 
  so would n't paying thousands of lira be equivalent to paying , like , three dollars ? 
  to be fair though , all muslims were expelled .

   on an unrelated note , when i search `` granny '' on google images , most of the pics are porn . 
  wtf , am i missing something ? 
  google tailors their results to your search history .

   no , jingoism is a kind of aggressive nationalism . 
  even something as seemingly inoffensively nationalist as believing in american exceptionalism only produces a sense of superiority . 
   jingoism is nationalism in the form of aggressive foreign policy . 
  [ 1 ] jingoism also refers to a country 's advocacy for the use of threats or actual force , as opposed to peaceful relations , in efforts to safeguard what it perceives as its national interests . 
  ** colloquially , it refers to excessive bias in judging one 's own country as superior to others -- an extreme type of nationalism . 
   extreme nationalism jingoism . 
  the word you 're looking for is * jingoism * . 
  there 's nothing wrong with nationalism . 
  everything you wrote is entirely accurate . 
  i 'm saying that pronouncing caela and pacem like an italian but cives as sives is entirely unnatural . 
  it 's inconsistent . 
  i 've spoken to people with tons of different pronunciations of latin , the thing is that they were always more consistent . 
   what you refer as `` regional variant '' are basically `` writing styles '' of historians of the time ; what i mean by regional variants is like spaniards pronouncing it similarly to ecclesiastical but still having trouble differentiating b and v because of the local pronunciation . 
  to be * completely * honest , i like the pre-decimal better . 
  there 's just something appealing about it . 
  so by all means , bring back the groat . 
  and while we 're at it , you guys should bring back the real de ocho .
