   i put here in latin when you 're learning latin , they usually tell you to pick a pronunciation and stick to it . 
  classical , ecclesiastical , or a regional varient . 
  whoever is singing that is all over the place . 
   old currency : 16 farthings = 1 groat , 63 groats to the guinea groats have long been discontinued , even prior to decimal day . 
  they 'd never bring that back . 
  they 'd bring back 12 pence = 1 shilling ; 20 shillings = 1 pound . 
  and the coins making that up being farthing ( 1/4 ) , half penny , threepence , sixpence , shilling , florin/two shillings , half crown , crown . 
  oh , it 's not . 
  it 's from the latin word for mutter , * muttum * . 
  the other guy was right , it 's probably just language families . 
  the word in latin is * parabola * , as in y = x ^ 2 , its descendants took different forms . 
  in classical latin it has the mathematical meaning , in vulgar latin it has the word meaning . 
  which is how you end up with , in italian for example , * parola * for word and * parabola * for a quadratic . 
  from * parabola * you can see * parola * and * palabra * . 
  * hopefully . 
  * ** edit ** : also where the word parable comes from . 
  successor states are responsible for the treaties and debts put in place by their predecessors . 
  modern turkey recognizes the treaties that the ottoman empire signed in the 1900s . 
  and when will the germans pay for varus ' lost legions ? 
  you germans caused an old man to stay awake at night screaming for his lost legions . 
  they show up here every now and then but then there 's also / r/etymologymaps . 
  that 's the fruit but the word of the fruit , in many cases , came before the colour . 
  so you 're right for italian and french , albeit with slight modification just like with romanian . 
  here 's the map : https://i.imgur.com/tqdarfo.jpg, 
  the use of portugal for orange is because portuguese traders introduced them to europe . 
  specifically the spanish newspapers reported on the health of the king who had it . 
  the spaniards on the other hand call it the naples soldier because of an opera . 
  the opera was as catchy as the flu . 
  yeah , in terms of bulk vocabulary it 's undoubtedly italian . 
  romanian is special for still having declensions though . 
  rereading this days later is sounds ruder than i wanted it to . 
  i do find that a lot of people tend to forget that romanians do speak a romance language and discount it because of slavic influence and maybe that 's why you have people who over compensate . 
  but it 's not the closest language to latin . 
  not by far . 
  my grandparents are monolingual neapolitan . 
  i always thought that it was pathetic and that they were some sort of exception . 
  how many people left in italy only speak their language ? 
   the grammar is still purely classical latin not even remotely . 
  no romance language has grammar similar to classical latin . 
  romanian has declensions , but in terms of cases it 's closest to late vulgar latin and in terms of what the cases have you do it 's not similar at all . 
  and verb conjugation , again in all romance languages , are n't even remotely similar to classical latin . 
  in fact , if you compare catalan with italian lexically , then it 's the closest language to catalan . 
  even closer than spanish . 
  attempting to fix perceived inequality with more inequality is n't a solution . 
  everyone deserves equal treatment . 
  * you do * . 
  i 'm not saying that romanian alone has had drift . 
  i 'm saying that the drift in romanian is much more marked than in the other romance languages because of the disconnection from the rest of the latin world . 
  in latin , sinister can be used for both left and something sinister . 
  a better example would be * vincere * in latin means * to conqueror * but in the other romance languages it just means * to win * . 
   it just shows romanian is connected to the oldest form of spoken latin no , no it does n't . 
  by the time the romans take dacia the oldest form of spoken latin had been dead for hundreds of years . 
   it 's likely `` heart '' and `` soul '' had the same meaning 4000 years ago . 
  nah , it 's related to the word for breath or wind . 
   i 'm fascinated more about how the name for jesus christ can be found rooted in the romanian term `` i sus '' meaning `` he is up '' that 's just a coincidence . 
  jesus is derived from a hebrew word . 
  actually jesus and joshua are the same name . 
  neapolitan uses something very similar . 
  that aside * susum * is a late latin word and that 's where your up comes from . 
  it 's also where the italian * su * comes from . 
  sus in latin actually means pig . 
  in fact , the romanian word for jesus is derived from old church slavonic , * not latin . 
  *  or the english word `` sustain '' which is again `` sustine '' in romanian from the words `` sus '' and `` tine '' meaning `` up '' and `` hold '' . 
  sustinere is the verb where all of this comes from . 
  and where in latin it 's formed from * sub + tenere * the romanian word takes it from sustinere directly . 
  it was n't reformed , the romanians did n't put * sus * together with * t , ine * to get it . 
  italian * sostenere * , spanish * sostener * all come from the same place . 
  -- why do romanians think , and i mean no offence to this , but think that romanian is the closest to latin ? 
  it 's not . 
  they both come from the same latin verb * castigare * meaning to castigate/to reprimand . 
  romanian exhibits a lot of drift compared to the other romance languages . 
  another example is * anima * means soul in latin but heart in romanian ( as * inima * ) . 
  you seem to be putting all the blame on the us . 
  there are a lot of ethnic turks within the eu , you could never cut relations . 
  did n't know it went that far back , thanks . 
   honestly , i 've never understood why ronald reagan was so praised believe me , i do n't either . 
  a lot of people credit him for his actions during the closing period of the cold war , similar to thatcher in that respect , but i felt a lot of it would have happened regardless . 
   america is a shining city on a hill it 's a famous speech . 
  [ ronald reagan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c32g868tor0 ) [ mario cuomo 's response ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kodiqksv624 ), 
   `` in god we trust '' stuff was added in the 1950s to the pledge and paper bills . 
  also adopted as the motto all in the 50s . 
  it has been on coins since the 1864 however . 
   i have never heard of a country having `` a strong aversion to circumcision '' . 
  it 's not country , it 's culture . 
  if you 're from a country where circumcision is unpopular the doctors are more likely to do more to avoiding circumcising . 
  southern european ( excluding the bulk of the balkans ) countries tend to have low circumcision rates and so are less likely to jump to it as a treatment for phimosis . 
  countries with high rates might not even be aware of the other options . 
  doctors in the united states tend to get cut-happy when it comes to the slightest hint of phimosis . 
  do n't think they 're too quick to do that in europe . 
  i did n't see much american bashing when i first commented . 
  still do n't . 
  i 'm not criticizing your decision . 
  only you know what is right for you . 
  but , that 's just the thing , infant circumcision is wrong because only you know what is right for you . 
  the vast majority will never have phimosis so routine infant circumcision should n't be used for treating it . 
  the vast majority will never run into any problem . 
  so for the vast majority you should wait until they 're either old enough or encounter a medical problem . 
  infant circumcision is ethically unacceptable . 
   `` fuck off do n't tell us how to run our countries , yeah , do n't tell us . 
  but a conversation is n't telling us , * it 's debate * .
