  from all the videos i watched with those people they claim that it is n't that type of '' '' `` mission '' '' '' . 
  that they are going on a fact finding mission and that * only if * they receive a distress call will they even approach migrants . 
  and in that case , and that case alone , they would return them to libya . 
  but their goal has nothing to do with migrants , it 's to expose the ngos . 
  whether they were telling the truth is a different story entirely . 
  but you are misrepresenting their '' '' `` objectives '' '' '' . 
  if you go to [ jugend rettet 's twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/jugendrettet ) they 're claiming , basically , that none of this is true . 
  that it 's a routine process , that nothing was impounded . 
  most countries are doing that . 
  i 'm pretty sure germany is on that , too . 
  the issue is arming people without actually knowing where they stand . 
  but i see your point and agree with you . 
   it 's true that the us is largely responsible for the problems we see in libya france . 
  france 110 % . 
   iraq i guess . 
   syria how ? 
   iran us and the uk did the coup , and the islamic revolution might have spun out of there but how much blame actually lies with us ? 
  * a decent amount * . 
  but the shah 's failure to make his population happy is the main issue . 
  he was brutal . 
   gently cradling a stranger 's testicles is not an acceptable greeting anywhere in the eu . 
  w-what ? 
  late , and at france 's request . 
  obama was n't reluctant , by most reports , it was clinton who convinced him . 
  france had already taken action by the time that the us got involved . 
   he was a famous pop-star in the 80 's sorta , he 's a former comedian . 
  no , france did it . 
  this is where you get into an issue of how you define a language . 
  calabrese , lucano , and pugliese would not generally be considered their own languages . 
  the majority of calabria is actually speaking a dialect of sicilian , the northern most parts speak neapolitan . 
  and both lucano and pugliese are neapolitan dialects . 
  [ does this help ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/neapolitan_languages.svg ) also take a look [ at a tree of indo-european languages . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/indoeuropeantree.svg ) also the map only shows people with over 1m native speakers . 
  i do n't think they have enough native speakers . 
  [ ask the brits for more info . 
   there are almost a hundred different languages spoken natively in europe , ** but only about 40 of them have 1 million speakers or more . 
  the map below shows estimates of the total number of native speakers for those languages . 
  yes , i remember eating * freedom fries * instead of * french fries * . 
  while your point is part of being an ally what i said is also part . 
  i never said it was n't . 
  never said it was either . 
  it 's just the way it is . 
  allies stick together . 
  it 's the whole concept of allies . 
  except allies tend to stick together , even if it 's a bad idea . 
  like in the iraq war . 
  italy joined late and berlusconi made various remarks that implied he was forced to . 
  america also joined late , at the behest of france . 
  obama was weary and clinton talked him into it . 
  france and the uk get the brunt of the blame for the libya mess . 
  stop blaming the us . 
  it was france . 
   they have every intention of bringing them to africa . 
  only if they rescue them . 
  he said it very clearly . 
   as of now the woman on that video has been detained by the italian police her twitter does n't say that . 
  source ? 
   they could in theory do something good but they do n't instil much trust as of now and i do n't expect much from them . 
  i do n't expect anything from them . 
  i anticipate more and more people will start doing similar things unless someone in government actually steps up to put an end to this . 
  they 're just a symptom . 
  i 've watched a couple interviews with them out of curiosity . 
  it seems that they are in touch with lawyers and intend to only operate in legal ways . 
  they also claim that they have no intention of * returning migrants to africa * as the title suggests , that they just intend to watch the ships to * expose wrongdoings by the ngos . 
  * at least that 's what they 're claiming . 
  if they actually follow through with it is a different question entirely . 
  who knows how they 'll actually act . 
  that is actually now officially against reddit rules . 
  they can not ban you for activity on a different subreddit . 
  as of now , the policy is scarcely enforced but it officially against the rules . 
  furthermore , do n't you think that 's a bit messed up ? 
  banning people because they post somewhere you do n't like ? 
   population replacement within europe has been normal for centuries invaders rarely supplant the native population . 
  what we are seeing now , massive population movements , is realistically unprecedented . 
  [ the definition changed throughout history ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/territorio_denominato_italia.jpg ) but augustan italy is `` classical '' italy . 
  throughout all of pomepii , particularly the brothels , you find interesting art ^ ^ [ nsfw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erotic_art_in_pompeii_and_herculaneum ) and [ graffiti ] ( http://www.pompeiana.org/resources/ancient/graffiti%20from%20pompeii.htm ) . 
  it 's a good way to get an idea of what romans were like outside the marble of cicero . 
  edit : forgot to mention , this graffito is absolutely beautiful :  i. 7.8 ( bar ; left of the door ) ; 8162 : we two dear men , friends forever , were here . 
  if you want to know our names , they are gaius and aulus . 
  their friendship is immortalized for all time . 
  cisalpine gaul is part of what most would consider italy though . 
  [ certainly the roman definition of it . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/roman_italy.gif ) i 'm not saying you did n't find citizens throughout the empire . 
  simply that being in the boundaries did n't make you one . 
   no , and you would n't go to armenia to immerse yourself in roman/italian history . 
  i meant because it 's just a quick jaunt away . 
  europe has so much history packed into a small area . .  i 've already been to italy , and it was a beautiful country . 
  did you visit pompeii ? 
  if you ever do make sure you visit the brothels . 
  you wo n't regret it . 
  oh , i only took side classes . 
  i 'm a programmer . 
  grain of salt . 
  azerbaijan and italy have good relations , built on oil , but good nevertheless . 
  the best way to learn history would be to immerse yourself . 
  france and spain are also good to visit . 
  and there are good museums everywhere . 
  even here in the us we have great roman exhibits . 
  i would say go see the temple in armenia , but maybe that 's not the best advice .
