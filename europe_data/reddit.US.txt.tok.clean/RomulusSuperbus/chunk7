  septimius severus was caracalla 's father . 
  it largely depends on what the other half is and the specific time period . 
  if you go back far enough , there is an ardent anti-greek movement in roman politics . 
  but for the majority of roman history greeks were adored . 
  in all of roman history germans were largely despised . 
  in the coliseums and games there was a type of gladiator called a gallus . 
  because of the roman issues with gauls . 
  keep in mind , [ they sacked rome . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_allia ) over time as gaul became more romanized and gallo-roman culture took over , the romans did n't dislike them so much anymore . 
  they integrated completely and even brought some stuff to the table . 
  so they replaced the galli with other types of warriors , such as the murmillones . 
  they did n't view them as enemy outsiders anymore and came to respect them . 
  septimius severus was punic and italian so he was probably alright . 
  carthage was once hated but , realistically , carthage was a beautiful empire . 
  still a bit barbaric , they sacrificed children afterall . 
  i dunno , there 's probably a first hand account on the opinions of him . 
  from what i read all positive . 
  but then again , classism runs deep . 
  also , public opinions of romans is n't really my strong suit . 
  so take this all with a grain of salt . 
  it 's been a while since i 've taken in depth classes on ancient rome . 
   the romans however were inclusive to the people they conquered , anybody within the borders of the roman empire was a roman citizen incorrect . 
  this happens with the reign of caracalla . 
  at the time of this inscription the romans had extreme class stratification and looked down on non-romans . 
  progressive how ? 
  inclusive how ? 
  this was insribed during the reign of vespasian . 
  vespasian was supportive of poets and even employed some . 
  but at the same time he revived harsh laws against philosophers and banishing some and even sentencing one to death . 
  just for speaking out against him or the principate in general . 
  also he instituted the first pay toilets . 
  not very progressive . 
  when you got ta go , you got ta go . 
  asia minor is still asia . 
  asia applies to anatolia and everything east of it . 
  but they did n't see continents as we do . 
  the name europe comes from a greco-roman myth . 
  jupiter/zeus has a hard on for a phoenician woman , europa , so he disguises himself as a white bull and befriends her . 
  they play together and get close . 
  then he kidnaps her and takes her back to crete with him . 
  she becomes the mother of king minos . 
  cretans are pretty big on bulls for whatever reason , the minotaur is also from crete . 
  i guess what i 'm trying to say is europe is wherever you find europeans . 
  the romans saw asia minor as just that - asia minor . 
  to them asia minor was a minor part of asia . 
  [ alexander the great goes on a quest to conquer asia and , as everyone knows , his troops refuse to keep fighting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogl_l0fok10 ) . 
  they miss their families . 
  but he had no idea what-so-ever that had he conquered deep into asia ( india ) that there would be so much more after it . 
  * eurus * meaning * broad * and likely the origin of the word europe ( along with ops meaning eye ) , is something that has been shown to come up often in proto-indo-european culture . 
  it appears to refer to the world , or at least the world as our primitive ancestors knew it . 
  the term africa in this time period refers solely to a [ roman province ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/africa_ ( roman_province \\ ) ) that was once the core of carthaginian territory . 
  the muslims take ifriqiya and apply it to the continent . 
  herodotus , in 400sbce , [ drew the world like this .

   why is italy letting them all in without any paperwork/i . d ? 
  eu and international law . 
   better still why is the italian navy picking migrants up off the coast of libya and ferrying them to italy ? 
  they 're not . 
  the ngos are . 
  italy 's navy is pretty stringent on not entering libyan waters . 
   we 've lost our minds . 
  god help our poor descendants who will inherit this mess . 
  shame on us . 
  this is correct . 
  i have n't seen the most recent numbers but bangladeshis and nigerians tend to be happy staying in italy . 
  there are established communities of them there . 
  a bunch still high-tail it north but less than , say , north africans , afghans , and other sub-saharan africans who almost certainly will try their hardest to move to northern countries . 
  [ horrific conditions . 
  ] ( https://www.thelocal.it/20140827/refugees-protest-against-monotonous-italian-food ), 
   you ca n't really blame them tho . 
  i blame no one other than our own shitty politicians . 
   that 's what happened with postwar european emigration towards the us . 
  the immigration was legal , for one . 
  they did n't go around shopping for the best deal . 
  and the us ** was n't ** afraid of deportations . 
  and they certainly did n't let people boss them around . 
  the companies that brought people into the us , the shipping/ocean liners , they were held to high standards and would be refused entry if they did n't comply . 
  when italian anarchists created problems we deported them back to italy and threatened the italian government if they ever managed to get back here . 
  when a tunisian is arrested in italy for violent crimes what happens ? 
  apparently he has the time to go commit a terrorist attack in germany because tunisia refused to accept him back and italy just went * meh * . 
  besides cancelling an olympic bid what has she done ? 
   turks in turkey are mostly descendents of anatolians most can claim some anatolia ancestry but genetic studies show a clear divide from ancient anatolians and modern turks . 
  typically , invaders do n't supplant the indigenous population , but can leave a mark . 
  turkey is an exception though , because how ottoman society was set up and the length of ownership - * never having lost it . 
  * the closer you go to greece the more european you get , excluding major cities , but it 's still a stark difference from the inhabitant of two millennia or even one millennium ago . 
  at least , that 's what i thought . 
  i 'm trying to find the specific study i 'm referring to but ca n't . 
  maybe i 'm mistaken , take it with a grain of salt . 
  but , i can find the studies that put ~ 20-30 % of modern turkish dna as asian . 
  which likely was n't the case 1000 years ago . 
  it 's certainly enough to make a dent on how a person looks and certain traits . 
  not to mention the middle eastern input , which , while absolutely already there in the original inhabitants , likely increased during turkish rule . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_studies_on_turkish_people  an admixture analysis determined that the anatolian turks share most of their genetic ancestry with non-turkic populations in the region and the 12th century is set as an admixture date . 
  * most * , but having  50 % does n't necessarily mean much . 
   1 ) in an afshar village near ankara where , according to oral tradition , the ancestors of the inhabitants came from central asia , the researchers found that 57 % of the villagers had haplogroup l , 13 % had haplogroup q , and 3 % had haplogroup n ; thus indicating that the l haplogroups in turkey are of central asian heritage rather than south asian , although these central asians probably received the l markers from the south asians at the beginning . 
  these asian groups add up to 73 % in this village . 
  furthermore , 10 % of these afshars had haplogroups e3a and e3b , while only 13 % had haplogroup j2a , the most common in turkey . 
  it seems like one description does n't fit turkey well . 
  one size does not fit all . 
  you 'd have to do your own research and find out for yourself .
