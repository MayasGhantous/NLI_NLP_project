  i 've travelled the world pretty well and can say that honestly . 
  america is the greatest country on the planet . 
  but there are certain things i do that are alien . 
   i am really sure that makes integration much easier / s. 
  integration and assimilation are n't the same thing . 
  integration happens relatively quickly , assimilation takes years . 
   you know the reason why the us never solved this problem before because the general who was winning the war accused truman of being a bitch and so truman removed him . 
  his replacement was not nearly as good as him , coupled with extra support from china , the n. koreans made tremendous strides . 
  this devolved into a war of attrition so then we ended up with the current borders . 
  macarthur would 've marched american troops into beijing if truman did n't stop him .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_truman%27s_relief_of_general_douglas_macarthur )  do n't make me believe you 're not able to smash such a tiny country wow , the french still have n't learned their lesson in libya ? 
  pathetic . 
  first of all , americans have to die to do that , as well as our allies . 
  if they 're not directly threatening us then the prospect of war is offensive to most people . 
  i do n't want americans going to die overseas . 
  a war against n. korea would be extremely justified , and extremely costly . 
  * are you gon na volunteer * ? 
  second , the north koreans are undereducated , malnourished , and do n't have industry . 
  these people ** immediately ** become refugees which the international community has to deal with . 
  though the brunt will lie with s. korea . 
  seeing how things went in libya after france advocated bombing them and the migrant crisis which has since become the most worrying issue of europe in modern times . 
  the worse refugee crisis since the second world war . 
  you think maybe we should think about this ? 
  france frequently accuses the us of being warmongers , excuse us for not living up to the label which you 've applied . 
  200,000 died the first time . 
  it 's not a matter of if we can , it 's if we want to . 
  they 're kinda threatening the world . 
   what i do n't get is that you do n't seem to know too much about catalonian economy and culture yet make broad assessments on what will hapens if we get independence . 
  i could know nothing and still these statements would hold true . 
  this applies to most countries . 
  padania , scotland , california , quebec , one-half of libya , corsica , texas . 
   brain drain ? 
  the best ranked universities in spain are , mostly , in catalonia , as the some of the best medical research and scientific research institutes . 
  i covered this and even gave you the california parallel . 
   they are in many cases not even funded by spain . 
  funding comes from many places and can easily be blocked by spain . 
  have you looked up the benefactors ? 
  all it takes is for one contributor to be a spanish nationalist and watch funds dry up . 
   nobody here cites football as a main reason to leave or remain , it 's an extremely childish argument . 
  that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm saying that boycotting catalan companies would be damaging . 
  i picked a soccer example for the sole reason that it 's clear and in your face . 
  it 's not some faceless multinational . 
  what are the major catalan companies ? 
  how do you think they 'd react if they thought spain would ban them from operating within their country ? 
  are any of them headed by people against the idea of a independent catalonia ? 
  you do realize that in order for them to get access to much of the eu they 'd have to , at the very least , move their headquarters . 
  they could pull a fiat-chrysler where officially they headquartered in one country , incorporated in another , and yet unofficially all the major control is still in the original country . 
  of course this still eats away at the money italy would be getting . 
  it 's massive hit . 
  look at all the countries moving to tax-havens , like ireland , to avoid paying taxes . 
  who knows how spain would react ? 
   how can spain block catalonia from joining the efta ? 
  do n't know . 
  i suppose they can file protests against all the other nations involved . 
  do you think that 's the only organization you need to be part of to succeed ? 
  -- this is n't a straight forward thing and there many actions nations can take to bite away at their neighbours . 
  think this through . 
  is independence worth the risk of losing so much ? 
  i could understand if the spanish were actually oppressing you . 
  but that 's not the case . 
  you have political grievances that can be easily solved in a parliamentary setting . 
   you can thank clinton and obama for that . 
  nope . 
  the uk and france , sarkozy specifically , were pushing for this . 
  america held out . 
  ultimately , it was clinton 's hawkish nature that forced us in . 
  but the majority of the blame alone rests on sarkozy . 
  most sources suggest that obama was apprehensive about doing anything . 
  the death warrant was signed the minute italy decided to join , though . 
  in the past italy sided with gaddafi . 
  even warning him before an american bombing would 've killed him - it did kill his daughter . 
  you 're american . 
  stop the self-hate . 
  stop acting like we 're the cause of everything wrong in the world . 
  we have problems , we 've caused problems , this is n't one of them . 
  --  25 february 2011 : sarkozy said gaddafi `` must go . 
  '' [ 55 ] that 's the first real statement any western power made . 
   19 march 2011 : french [ 73 ] forces began the military intervention in libya , later joined by coalition forces with strikes against armoured units south of benghazi and attacks on libyan air-defence systems , as un security council resolution 1973 called for using `` all necessary means '' to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas from attack , imposed a no-fly zone , and called for an immediate and with-standing cease-fire , while also strengthening travel bans on members of the regime , arms embargoes , and asset freezes . 
  [ 19 ] first to attack , too . 
  america quickly joined but it 's unsurprising that we were n't going to let france go it alone . 
  nato joined quickly at france 's behest . 
  it is clear , ** especially if you read what wikileaks released ** , that it was france 's doing . 
   the only one who would have both the power and at least a semblance of a moral highground ( lol ) would be the us . 
  and the situation has it that there is that guy in the white house right now who would probably stand with us . 
  even without trump , america will never alienate our european allies . 
  not with the russian situation . 
  we may take a moral stance and say * you ca n't do that * but it will just be a verbal statement . 
  no action would be taken . 
  especially if europe as a bloc agreed to take the action . 
  it seems to me that they need * each other * . 
  except if they leave spain they 'd lose much of it . 
  * the spaniards who want to remain spanish and not catalan - some will leave . 
  could be a potential brain drain . 
  * whatever spanish run institute that is there will leave . 
  * spaniards , and supporters of spain , could end up with a bitter hatred of them for leaving . 
  soccer teams and business could be boycotted . 
  * difficulty joining international unions and treaties - spain will block them , italy ( because of venice and padania as a whole ) will block them , the uk ( because of scotland ) will block them . 
  one country can do a lot of damage .
