look , maybe one day we 'll be part of the group that thinks circumcision is baby mutilation . 
  but we have more important things to worry about , like allowing for abortions and gay marriages . 
  one problem at a time , you know ? 
  as it stands , americans like being circumcised . 
  a declining percentage ? 
  yes . 
  but still a majority . 
  it 's not something our country will probably `` think about '' ( and those are n't meant to be sarcastic quotes at all ) for a while . 
  sure , it 's easy to say that , but growing up here you 'd have grown up in a different culture . 
  are you american ? 
  i did n't say it was clever . 
  but it stuck . 
  and you know how high school is . 
  nicknames can be brutal . 
  but we ( americans ) circumcised hardly feel shame , because not having your dick cut is the `` weird '' version and certainly no one thinks circumcision is `` mutilating '' any more than cutting the umbilical cord is . 
  i suppose at some point down the road it will get banned since it 's declining here , though . 
  fgm is worse , and has a wider range of problems . 
  our circumcisions are done with doctors and anesthetics , as well . 
  and we certainly do n't feel shameful over here about our dicks . 
  not many americans see circumcision as `` mutilation '' and i think that 's where the problem lies . 
  we do n't even think about it . 
  we ca n't remember the pain -- if any -- so it 's not something that ever plagues us . 
  maybe europeans think more about babies ' health & penises than we do , i do n't know . 
  i know for sure that that there is n't some mass impotence crisis in the us due to circumcised dicks . 
  honestly , at least where i grew up , being uncut would definitely be considered `` weird '' . 
  i 'm guessing it 's the same for most rural places , if not most of the us . 
  there was a kid at my school who was uncut ( and probably the only one ) and was called `` dog dick '' for his entire time high school . 
  i 'm not saying that he would never get laid , but i 'm sure that did n't help . 
  i 'd say in that case , with the medical benefits at least slightly outweighing the risks , the cultural benefits that come with circumcision must be weighed . 
  if my kid were born in europe , i 'd obviously consider a different path rather than if my kid were born in the us . 
  ** edit : ** spelling, 
  all right , easy , no need to be a d about it, 
  haha , hey , i 'd rather listen to people talk microbrews than bud light any day, 
  trust me , i know both countries outdrink mine . 
  this is just one big burn train, 
  meanwhile , on the opposite side of the scale ... 
  in my hometown ( rural ) it 's common courtesy to say `` hello '' to people you meet in stores , people will talk to you while in line at a store or filling up on gas , and people do say things like `` sir '' or `` ma'am '' often . 
  really , the politeness/talking to people run together, 
  oh yeah , i 'm sure harlem is better nowadays . 
  just kind of relative comparison . 
  any specific idea on where the patches are in brooklyn ? 
  just out of curiosity . 
  just a few things ** do ** practice politeness in a rural setting , but if you 're in a big city , please/thank you/excuse me is about all you 'll need . 
  if you walk around in cities , you will hear most people swear , especially the young adults/younger kids . 
  you * wo n't * find people shaking their heads with shame or tsk-ing . 
  ** do ** feel free to talk to people is the same thing . 
  out in the country , sure , people will chat you up . 
  in cities , you 're more likely to get a friendly response about half the time . 
  ** do ** feel safe definitely depends on where you are . 
  the us is safe , but certainly not safer than most developed european countries . 
  example , my city of pittsburgh has a good bit of violent crime , but almost all of it 's located in a couple specific neighborhoods . 
  everywhere else is fine there . 
  manhattan in new york is safe , but harlem is right above and not so safe . 
  nighttime in the rural areas are probably the safest crime-wise . 
  you 're more likely to get shot trespassing than shot by a mugger . 
  and ** do n't ** assume everyone is happy to see you . 
  racism is pretty big here , especially in the south/southwest . 
  yes , people are terribly informed about the world and ignorant of your country/culture , but it may just be because they do n't care about any other country . 
  yes !, 
  pittsburgh people go crazy for fireworks . 
  i do n't get it . 
  i got over fireworks after like the 5th time i saw them . 
  `` cringey '' is a perfect word to describe tomorrow . 
  why ca n't it be more like roland emmerich 's independence day ? 
  one can only dream : /, 
  jokes on you , man !, 
  born in pittsburgh , pa ( a city in one of the original 13 colonies , i might add ) . 
  i just happen to have a couple of friends who turn into '' ` mericans '' on the 4th and wear/yell/drink to everything that is and ever will be the us . 
  i want res to block them in particular . 
  ** edit : ** added words, 
  i 'm a yank and i think this is a great fucking idea . 
  now if only res applied to real life ... 
  ah , thank you good sir . 
  i must know this game 's name, 
  * nervously looks around *, 
  biased because of `` anti-immigration '' ? 
  are the fn not anti-immigration ? 
  ah , the tea party has made it to europe , i see, 
  given everything that happened , i 'd have to say it was a little more than mildly concerning . 
  i 'd say the `` great recession '' was the main cause of the greek economic fall , but to blame its entrance into the euro as the main cause would be overgeneralizing and skipping over a lot . 
  i 'm of the opinion greece would 've been better off if france had been allowed to take the lead on the lending to the greek government ( i.e. , more lenience ), 
  um , citation ... needed ? 
  edit : kidding , https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0aonyzs4mzlzbddzsu2k2veq2elkwcnndotnhs3zwrke&amp;hl=en#gid=1 via oecd, 
   [ citation needed ] [ citation needed ], 
  honestly , i 'm just happy this ended up being a civil argument . 
  too often do they end in ad hominems and sarcasm . 
  thanks for the link , btw, 
  i 'm kind of specifically talking about tech companies , since that 's the story i hear all the time ( i.e. , us is startup heaven ) . 
  edit : yeah , i 'm not trying to be a dick with the citing thing . 
  i actually like reading news articles , to be honest . 
  europe still has more f500 companies than the us . 
  and china will probably overtake the us before europe falls below . ^ 1  california alone has founded dozens of now fortune 500 's in the last 30 years . 
  dozens is a pretty ambiguous number . 
  if you 're gon na ask me to cite , i have to return the favor . 
  i can see maybe 10 . 
  that 's pushing it . 
  i can name all of the startups that have either failed or been bought and dismantled , if you 'd like . 
  1 . http://www.magazine.org/node/25721, 
  i wonder why the hell it was declined . 
  i ca n't imagine the legal argument for not accepting it .
