  uh , objection , extremely racist . 
  we have tons of rotund people who have never seen the light of day . 
  i 'm taking you to the hague for that comment !, 
  edit : i know many people who are introverted as well , so i hope you like double xenophobic charges !, 
  you know what i 'm taking about , 
  ... what ? 
  i 'm also the descendant of two wwii veterans , one polish-american and the other russian-american , and like / u/beardofearth , i 'm not offended . 
  so where does that leave us ? 
  i dunno , they really pound it into you not to drop the soap, 
  sounds like my freshman year at college . 
  yeah , a good pb&j should n't be stuffed full of peanut butter . 
  you have to obtain that perfect balance . 
  you should try it with apples . 
  scoop up peanut butter ( preferably crunchy ) with apple slices . 
  probably best if you use a sweet but sour apple . 
  also , peanut butter and jelly/jam/preserves / etc. 
  peanut butter and nutella makes a good sandwich . 
  peanut butter , bananas , and honey also make a good sandwich . 
  you should also try peanut butter and fish . 
  the savory creaminess of the pb really brings out the umami of the fish . 
  just kidding about that last one , 
  are you a [ peep show fan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-dz68jf58k ) as well ? 
  50/50 chance ? 
  sounds like a great day here !, 
  too soon , man . 
  too soon :'(, 
  agreed . 
  i always use the nordic countries or britain as our gold standard . 
  people still get sarcasm . 
  you just do n't know how to use it . 
  exactly . 
  i think most of the us subscribers ( myself included ) * like * europe and the way they do things . 
  i would hate for you guys to turn into any kind of america . 
  even if i were , i would never be so pretentious as to put any - phile on my facebook . 
  hey , i do the same thing , but i do n't think it 's bad to avoid commenting . 
  there seems to be a lot of american users who comment on / r/europe threads with typical american idiocy . 
  those are the ones who give us a bad name . 
  and there are discussions here that we do n't need to be involved in . 
  `` this is really an issue between europeans . 
  americans need not comment , '' is my thought on those specific threads . 
  dude , what the hell , we 're not friends ? 
  that 's cold , mate ... 
  the difference is that `` deer '' and `` demon '' are nouns , whereas rabid and crazy are adjectives . 
  something like rabid raccoon hunter would be more confusing , and you 'd probably need to add a hyphen to clarify ( e.g. , rabid-raccoon hunter is a hunter of rabid raccoons and a rabid raccoon-hunter is a raccoon hunter who is rabid ) . 
  i 'm just now noticing you 're irish and probably have a full grasp of the english language but fuck it , i 'm not deleting my first paragraph . 
  you post states that marriage is historically defined as a union between a man and a woman with the ultimate goal of having children and forms a bedrock of society . 
  but if you do n't need to be married to have a stable family life , then what is the importance of the legal state of marriage ? 
  it provides tax benefits and offers a `` proof of love , '' if you will , but if you do n't need to be married to have kids and raise a healthy family , what then is the main reason to keep the status quo ? 
  the funniest moments often are : /, 
  i loved these movies . 
  the chicken farm bits were the best, 
  there is nothing in modern society that suggests marriage needs to be defined by the union of a man and a woman . 
  people today can live a happy life raising kids without ever getting married . 
  marriage is n't necessary to raise children . 
  why then should it be preclude gays from getting married ? 
  marriage is a legal status , not a religious one . 
  just because you live in a backwards country where `` tradition '' trumps equality , does n't make it right . 
  we used to think slavery was fine and dandy . 
  people need to change with them . 
  a plage of locusts might actually be worse than a plague, 
  i think that 's a plage, 
  hey , remember when that guy snowden released all of those documents about the nsa ? 
  actually , we ( the u.s. ) * do * know how many were prevented because of the nsa surveillance . 
  the answers vary from [ not much ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-phone-record-collection-does-little-to-prevent-terrorist-attacks-group-says/2014/01/12/8aa860aa-77dd-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html ) to [ one ] ( http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/youll-never-guess-how-many-terrorist-plots-the-nsas-domestic-spy-program-has-foiled ) . 
  if the best state-wide surveillance can do is convict a cab driver `` for sending money to a terrorist group in somali '' , well , i believe it 's time we rethink our methods . 
  huh , i just assumed it had proliferated into internet common knowledge . 
  it was this old psa they used to have in the '90s where they 'd give a briefer on some educational facts and they always ended it with the quote `` the more you know '' . 
  wow , i did n't know squirrel was a verb . 
  the more you know . 
  we do . 
  i did n't know you guys pronounced it differently . 
  so in british english it 's two syllables ? 
  the burning of our flag is more often in protest against `` america '' or our government and its policies , rather than the individuals . 
  hell , americans burn the u.s. flag . 
  we do n't lynch them and shoot up their workplace because of it . 
  conservative firebrands might talk up a storm , but in the end the most that will happen is he 'll be really disliked on facebook or something . 
  probably get some hate mail , as well . 
  so when the balrog is awakened , we now know who to blame . 
  norway 's bane, 
  that is an awesome building and i would totally chug beer on it and watch ships . 
  that sounds relaxing as hell . 
  i know , i know , but i * do * like those designs . 
  makes me think of the `` utopia '' drawings that people designed in the '50s - '70s . 
  haha , so i 've heard . 
  i 've found that not many people like brutalist buildings , which is fine , of course . 
  i like those shitty apartment buildings . 
  the outside , at least . 
  i know they do n't look `` nice '' , but that 's taste for you . 
  one of the buildings at my uni was done in `` american '' brutalist and it 's badass . 
  it 's [ posvar hall ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=posvar+hall&amp;t=opera&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images ) and having classes in it was like stepping back into the cold war . 
  if there 's one thing the soviets did right , it 's architecture . 
  i love the brutalist apartment buildings dotting the landscapes . 
  there must be a ton of americans on this thread , because all the pro-british english comments are getting down-voted to hell . 
  for the record , i totally agree with you . 
  our accents sucks . 
  i 'd rather hear * any * british accent than an american one . 
  we have ugly accents . 
  even the gen american / midland dialect is awful in comparison to , say , a geordie or cockney . 
  for what it 's worth , i love your gov ' t form and your parliament and wish we had something similar . 
  i know , when i first saw the article i had assumed that the driver jumped out before the tank hit .
