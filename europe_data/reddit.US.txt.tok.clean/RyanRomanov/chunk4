  that moment when you confuse game of thrones with real life, 
  please !, 
  please cut it off , cut it off !, 
  varys , if it pleases you , milord, 
  uh , i was n't even aware of / r/floridaman until / u/gawd1 's comment ... 
  i mean , you guys lose a lot of good land , but we lose florida . 
  almost seems like a good trade-off . 
  finally , some closure haha . 
  it 's nice to have a grammar conversation on here without it devolving into a pointless argument  . 
  based on your link , in their sentence prior , spoke is past , and in my own example spoke could be subjunctive ( since the future + subjunctive is n't one of the examples on your source ) . 
  now they and i are both wrong . 
  honestly , i do n't think `` become '' requires the subjunctive . 
  spoke is simple past . 
  and as / u/mtgdjs pointed out , it should be `` people from the uk * would be * a happier bunch if they spoke french . 
  in the conditional , you can see that spoke should be past , not subjunctive . 
  well , um , i 'm not so sure you did . 
  `` will become '' is future and `` if they spoke '' is just past tense . 
  regardless , i have to agree about your romance languages bit, 
  hey , we have a subjunctive !, 
  as in , if i * were * in whatever country you live in , i could give you this example in person . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_subjunctive now , whether or not we use it is another question ... 
  similar to the u.s. , at least for my state . 
  ours is a bit more lax , but , for example , driving  30mph over the posted speed limit is 5 points on your license ( out of 6 possible points ) . 
  you have to attend a driver hearing with our state dot , where you 'll either get a 15-day suspension or an on-road driving exam or both . 
  sure , but it would be cooler if ours were n't so poorly drawn . 
  the eagle 's not even holding the [ arrows ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_federal_executive_departments#/media/file:united_states_department_of_defense_seal.svg ) . 
  the bison is the worst part . 
  it 's like , `` hey , remember this animal we basically hunted to extinction ? '', 
  eagles are pretty cool , though . 
  could be worse . 
  ours are just a [ fuck-ton of eagles and flags ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_federal_executive_departments#seals ), 
  i think he 's talking about european union laws , a group of which australia is not a part, 
  the article has `` statesmen '' written , so perhaps they meant people like a president . 
  or maybe at the time of the ambassador 's quote he was the only one thinking of going . 
  i 'm not saying he should n't be going , just that op posted an article that did n't back up his claims at all . 
  did you read the article ? 
  the ambassador simply said it would `` be awkward '' if he were the only eu rep to show up . 
  he did n't tell him where to go , that 's the czech president 's inference . 
  clickbait title , nothing to see here . 
  i 'm happy for you guys . 
  i read an article not too long ago about the woman heading the anti-corruption charges . 
  i wish we had a couple of hers over here in the u.s. 
  ah , of course . 
  that does n't seem to be a big thing in sweden , so i 'm not sure the comparison works . 
  but , for bars in which spontaneous dancing on or off tables is not unseen , the owner will simply have to get a different permit . 
  in what country is that a common thing to do ? 
  even in the us , you 'd get thrown out for dancing on a table . 
  thanks for that . 
  this law is one of those `` seems crazy at first glance '' things , but the explanation clarifies it . 
  hey , some of us americans * like * europe and are on this sub to get european news and viewpoints , and occasionally join some discussions . 
  i think i 'd feel more at home in the uk than in the u.s. 
  i 'm sorry if you get upset over some of the ( imo ) stupid remarks americans tend to make here -- the overused `` freedom '' and military tropes , for example . 
  but you should n't lump us all into the loudmouth americans group . 
  bestern world *, 
  yep . 
  always the trashy kind . 
  i like the regular bus riders for the exact reason you stated . 
  it 's like a mutual understanding between the quiet regulars that the most we do is nod to each other . 
  if that . 
  americans . 
  and always the ones you do n't want to talk to . 
  attractive lady or cool dude reading the new yorker ? 
  no , do n't expect a conversation with them . 
  large fat guy with missing teeth and a very ... unique odor ? 
  he 's got his vocal firearm aimed right at you . 
  come on , man . 
  you 're making us look bad . 
  seriously , try living in america . 
  half the population are massive pork-bellies . 
  it 's to find good looking women * and * men here . 
  thank you for that . 
  fucking hell , i laughed the whole time, 
  obama is a pretty good president , and i think history will be a lot kinder to him than people are today . 
  i ca n't wait to read the section on bush in history books 20 years from now . 
  i 'm really hoping they mention all of his gaffes . 
  i do n't think the movie was a literal propaganda piece . 
  if anything , they probably made it really patriotic because movie about soldiers + american flags + guns/explosions = instant blockbuster/boner here . 
  but it does add fuel to the fire , so to speak . 
  well , american sniper did play off the whole `` die-hard patriot '' wave . 
  i 've seen heard enough people tell others that they 're un-american ( or the likes ) because they thought the film was stupid . 
  but christ , the interview ? 
  i guess seth rogen and james franco are our modern day goebbels . 
  as an american , i appreciate this post . 
  i do n't condone everything my country does , but you can be sure i always vote for `` good '' politicians and speak out against the putins of america . 
  i 'd like the us to stand * with * other countries , not above them . 
   honest question , would 2 % actually solve anything ? 
  would it have prevented the ukraine invasion ? 
  probably not , considering that europe 's * de facto * leader merkel is more of a negotiator than a brawler . 
  i think europe views russia differently than we do . 
  to me , at least , russia is a thorn in our side . 
  they 're a regional power with nukes . 
  they are n't strong enough to actually take us head on , but they are wily enough to maneuver around us as we started shifting our focus to the pacific . 
  i doubt europe views than as negatively as we do , although i 'm sure this varies country to country ( i 'm looking at you poland  . 
  i do not think russia would back down from a europe sans the backing of the us , or at least they would be willing to push for a little more land and/or benefits . 
  i * do * think you guys in nato should pay your 2 % , if only because `` them 's the rules '' and you knew them before you joined . 
  however , i 'm okay with the us being the `` guard dog '' , if you will , of europe . 
  i think the relationship we have is fairly balanced . 
  i do n't think obama is trying to score political points as much as he is saying , `` we have china and se asia to focus on , so it would be nice if we did n't have to keep looking over our shoulder to make sure you europeans are ok . '' there might also be a time when the world is in a cold war again , the western allies vs. china and her allies . 
  if that is the case , it would also be nice to have you guys at * our * back with enough military might to make a difference . 
  france has a fairly strong military force , so i think his comments are more directed towards countries like germany and the uk .
