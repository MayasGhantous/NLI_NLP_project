also , fords are crap . 
  i just hope they fix this asap . 
  sure people want to see heads rolling , and there will be , but the ones that get hurt the most are the regular employees . 
  ceo/corporate will all get their usual bonuses for millions regardless . 
  it was op get him  : /, 
   the ** only downside ** to this is the possibility of this scuppering any chance of vw entering formula one within the next few years ... do you work for vw ? 
   the eu should send groud troops and fix this clusterf once and for all . 
  yep , wished they would too . 
  you seriously think u can find 3 million people in america that want to declare war on china/russia ? 
  what possible reason could they have ? 
  i do n't think any one with a straight mind would back up that sentiment . 
  it takes a lot to go to war , and it also implies a lot . 
  hell when russia was loaded with nukes , and amassing * tanks , choppers , etc there was no war . 
  what reason could there be ? 
  seems like lunacy . 
   i can find 3 million americans who would be fine attacking china and russia . 
  no u ca n't lol . 
  some people place way too much value on social media ... 
  when the world is trying so hard to fuck it self over , this is the obvious outcome ( sanctions on russia , russia retaliating in similar fashion , greece , protectionist tariffs on chinese merchandise , etc ) . 
  in the long run things should get better , but i doubt this has bottomed out . 
  a unified eu would definately be more efficient , but increase investment in military should not be left out of the question . 
  i think most would be happy with a united eu army , since it would bring stability . 
  an eu that can defend itself is a healthy eu . 
  the challenge is whether eu nations can agree , and what system of checks and balances would be in place to ensure it benefits all eu nations , and to lower the obvious magnet for corruption it would be . 
  could n't agree more . 
  do n't forget spain issuing fines to any anyone who critiques the police . 
  this is clearly crossing a line into blatant corruption . 
  now if you report a police officer doing something illegal , in spain , they can ( and have ) openly and legally retaliate against you . 
  that is relative though ... any major flaws of your culture you will rationalize as an inevitable part of `` progress '' or `` security '' or what have you . 
  even western countries are brain washed , but we do n't believe ourselves to be . 
  excellent , we can export memes to them now . 
  no sir , you are angry , i am mad . 
  wished us would be less involved in eu . 
  eu should be allowed to fight its own wars . 
  regardless of who 's side us takes it always generates more enemies , and such involvement is a massive drain of resources as well . 
  i think us should have a more neutral view of eu , and work on bettering relations with other regions . 
   implying protectionist policies are not in effect in america . 
  where is that implied ? 
  it 's obvious nations do what is in their best interest , which is why it would be moronic to give all sovereign power to one region . 
  might as well put this agreement in the shredder , it 's not some desperate country trying to join ez they are trying to hustle . 
   they falsely accused sadaam of 9/11 which was more than a decade later . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  i do n't agree that isis is `` 100x '' worse than saddam lol . 
  saddam had a whole army , and would of caused a whole lot more damage . 
  do n't forget he was threatening to take over neighboring nations . 
  i do agree on the other point though , us should stop in sending troops , equipment , and other resources in meddling eu affairs . 
  eu has a right to deal with its own issues and as such us should not get involved . 
  us should focus its attention to regions that are more trade friendly , were investments are welcomed . 
  the us is not in the eurozone ... 
  i feel you are just trying to deflect blame over broken eurozone rules . 
  is it for real this time ? 
  i feel like this type of article hits the front page every week, 
  i think the message was , it is a eurozone problem , the imf is not the eurozone , it represents nations ( and funds ) outside of the eurozone . 
  in the end ez does what it wants for ez countries , but outside entities should not interfere with that sovereignty . 
  it 's easy to say `` why do n't you pay off one of our countries for us instead of telling us how we are fucking up '' but what if it were the other way around , you guys okay with crossing that sovereignty line just the same ? 
  yup , but would n't be the internet without circle jerkin regardless, 
  a lot of people are n't going to like this , but this is probably the reality of what is needed to maintain the euro in the long run . 
   i would also like to state that i truly believe in the special relationship . 
  if the world were going to shit the only 6 countries i would trust are the uk , canada , ** mexico ** , australia , japan , and south korea . 
  `` trust '' in what sense ? 
  mexico is run by drug cartels ... edit : oh , as in go to war with right ? 
  yeah sounds right, 
  does that mean the whole show/movie needs to be in the native language ? 
  or do subtitles meet that requirement ? 
  hmm , very interesting . 
  sounds like it should n't be to much trouble for them to fix with a little effort if they got enough feed back . 
  i mean they already have the english subtitles , they just need to make them available in different countries . 
  netflix what ? 
  as an outsider lookin in , what is the issue with netflix in europe ? 
  i 'm not * referring to privacy , privacy is definately important and a very reasonable argument . 
  people arguing over each other 's nations being too incompetent to do anything with the information is a stupid argument though . 
  cool , let 's not cooperate to fight terrorist for the sake of nationalism / s, 
  so in switzerland people make more money , work less hours and pay less taxes . 
  i do n't see what that has to do with `` work ethic . '', 
  if anything it has more to do with `` employer ethic . '', 
  also , america is a magnet for immigration from countries all over the world , which means more people competing for jobs ( global competition for doctors and engineers for example ) . 
  makes it easier to understand , helped me . 
  if only there was someone who could read german and english as well : c, 
  still think it will attract . . `` interesting '' attention . 
  try it :p, 
   because he wanted to legitimate the use of statements made under torture wtf ... 
   it seems very unlikely to see sch\u00e4uble resign . 
  he is still a realy popular minister crushed hopes and dreams :(, 
  every article that talks about the euro gets down voted . 
  i think its more people being scared and trying to hide the `` ugly truth '', 
   it can be fixed fairly easily , by raising a small tax , which is meant for road repairs in california that is how they raise taxes for pensions . 
  `` lets add 1 % to sales tax to fix the roads . . ok , lets take funds from the road tax to pay pensions . . ok lets pass another law to fix roads , for real this time because the road fund ran out . . '' another good one is , `` this tax is for fixing schools and stuff . . ok lets take that money and use it to pay teacher pensions instead '' it never ends ... 
  so ... it all of this because of 2 billion ? 
  man did that snowball, 
  makes sense , ty for clarifying !, 
  squirrel is refusing to communicate without legal representation , although sources say it may simply not understand the local dialect . 
  edit : on a more serious note , wtf ? 
  i do n't agree with member of syriza being removed for not voting along party lines . 
  what is the point of democracy if you boot anyone who disagrees with your point of view ? 
  not sure how officials are appointed in greece , but do n't they have obligations to their local constituents ? 
  way i see it is , they can continue working on negotiations , and if necessary the drachma , but it is essential they get the banks and their economy running again first . 
  even if they hated the agreement , and are hated because of it , they ca n't just stand by and watch their people starve to death . 
  you tube really needs a mute button for that chat . . 
  we really going to pretend nazi 's are anything but * raw racism and hatred ? 
  make it count greece : /,
