true . 
  i guess what i 'm getting at is that all those yellow `` vull ... '' banners are really leaving me the impression that catalans are viewing independence as the promised land and that it 'll automatically be everything that spain/madrid is n't . 
  my favorite of the banners is [ `` i want a country that reads more '' ] ( http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0658/8355/products/18-2x800_llegir_0fbe6b97-996d-4a31-8bb1-98887bdcf7f8.jpg?v=1413281236 ) . 
  this is the kind of wide-eyed naivete that helped absolutely ruin russia in the 90s and led to putin - not that i 'm saying catalonia would be in that path , but there really have to be some serious discussions more than just `` ens roba espanya '' and `` serem lliures '' . 
   and well , madrid , where preety much all the ex-government ** is being investigated ** and last week they sent a shit ton of politicians to prison already because of a corrption case involving the 2 major parties in spain . 
  so , these politicians are being investigated , which means that they 're most likely corrupt - after all , the other politicians being sent to prison that you mention in the same sentence implies as much . 
   meanwhile in catalonia what ? 
  the millet case , and the pujol case which ** is still under investigation and it is possible that results in nothing ** ? 
  so , we ca n't jump to conclusions about pujol , because the case is under investigation , which now * does n't * imply much about guilt ? 
  that 's some serious cognitive dissonance there . 
  either being investigated means that they 're most likely corrupt or it does n't - you ca n't have it both ways . 
  by the way , the eu released [ a report ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/work/2012_02_governance.pdf ) ranking regions by corruption - guess which region in spain ranked the lowest . 
  but it would n't be starting anew , would it ? 
  say that catalonia becomes independent tomorrow - considering that catalonia already has its own version of a national police ( mossos d'esquadra ) and its own government system , it 'd seem highly likely that the system would n't change that much ( asides from junqueras/mas now being president of a country instead of just a region ) . 
  overall , it seems somewhat naive to think that corruption can be prevented/solved by declaring independence from the rest of spain , especially considering that the eu itself released [ a study ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/docgener/work/2012_02_governance.pdf ) that pointed out catalonia as one of the most corrupt regions in the eu . 
  honest question here : does any of that 70 % include anybody from ppc ? 
  i could grant that the pp is absolutely rotten , but there 's an implication here that this is a spanish-only ( i.e. 
  not catalonia ) problem and that catalonia would be free of such corruption were it to secede . 
  he 's still on reddit , but it looks like he 's done with the european sub-reddit and is just hanging out in gaming subs now . 
  nice to see a russia section after 3dom 's departure . 
  can we get a color guide for that geopolitical map of russia ? 
  and they 're all so bloody small . 
  seriously , even new buildings have cramped elevators - any spaniards able to comment on why this is ? 
  based on those responses to junqueras 's tweet , i guess we 're going to see `` dui '' ( `` declaraci\u00f3 unilateral d'independ\u00e8ncia '' ) a lot more in the upcoming months ... 
  google translate :  the president of the generalitat , artur mas , has admitted this afternoon before matches that have driven query sovereigntist november 9 that the vote can not be held for lack of legal guarantees and proposed them to organize a public participation process for the review of the catalans on the political future of catalonia . 
  during a tense meeting that began at noon and continued past nine in the evening , mas claimed the support of ciu , erc , and cup initiative to organize this alternative process . 
  so far it has failed . 
   but the plan , which the government dismissed just four days ago , is based on getting the most out of the articles that the constitutional court suspended the catalan law queries . 
  sources parties met with the catalan president explained that the goal would be to hold what in law is called `` participatory process '' . 
   this alternative deeply dislike much of the sovereigntist parties that have so far supported the catalan president , believing that it is a substitute would not have any legal validity to international bodies . 
  the lack of party support has forced to extend the meeting to avoid officially broken by consensus between the president and the four formations . 
   but he forwarded this proposal to the parties during a meeting in the palace of pedralbes in barcelona and the sovereignist parties see as a last chance to save the 9-n .  the government tried , unsuccessfully , that the meeting be discreet and away from the media . 
  not so . 
   the tension between the parties was evident from the morning , for technical consultation on november 9 independence and can not be done , at least as initially proposed in the decree of convocation of it . 
  suspension of this decree the constitutional court , as well as much of the catalan law consultations , the government has prevented complete voter registration within the time limits as well as the organization of the polling stations . 
   the parties came to the meeting after the catalan government and their environment and begin to change the message of the last few months . 
  instead of insisting that consultation november 9 whatever happens today no longer felt sure nothing is held . 
  the minister for enterprise , felip puig tried to downplay the possible cancellation of 9-n ensuring that if that day can not vote `` will at a later date . '', 
   the chairman of the national transitional council which advises artur mas , carles viver pi-sunyer , advocated a call early elections and try to give them a character of a plebiscite on independence . 
  according viver these elections `` have the advantage of being a process within the law and is very difficult to prohibit it . 
  the call is made by the president through a decree , which can not be challenged , and the programs of the parties in principle are not actionable , `` he said . 
  in an interview on catalunya radio , viver stressed the advantages of this type of elections from now . 
  `` the parliament had a mandate to call a vote . 
  [ with the plebiscite ] it would be a new mandate , which is to make a new state , `` he added . 
  if overcome the forces with independence in your program , this jurist advocates prepare `` state structures '' to proclaim the independence medium term . 
  that actually makes perfect sense . 
  he did n't like bush 's foreign policy , but he still liked the us in general - same as an american like me !, 
  now , if he said that he hates all americans but * still * wanted to move there , that 'd be funny . 
  i 'd hope that this debacle will help force the eu to recognize that it needs to be more united in just about everything , not just with energy . 
  the conflict has exposed just how weak the eu is as an institution , with russia picking it apart by playing the individual countries against each other , be it gas , economic deals/sanctions , and supporting euroskeptic/right-wing political parties ( fidesz/jobbik , arguably fn and berlusconi ) . 
  history has no shortage of examples of disorganized entities getting taken over by a united force - russia itself was conquered by the mongol horde because , at the time , it was only a smattering of bickering princedoms and republics - and the eu needs to avoid following suit . 
  beaver and michigan stadiums are brutalist ? 
  first time i 've ever heard that , especially considering there 's almost no concrete in either of the stadiums . 
  and rain ? 
  that 's what ponchos are for ; if we had a roof on our stadium , we would n't have had [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aomx9usa4hs ), 
  amateurs . 
  come to the us , where we have three of the five largest stadiums in the world !, 
  [ michigan stadium ] ( http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/mich/graphics/auto/michigan-stadium_660.jpg ) : 109,901 . 
  [ ohio stadium ] ( http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/osu/graphics/facilities/stadium-day-800x325.jpg ) : 108,362 . 
  [ beaver stadium ] ( http://www.happyvalleyvip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/beaver-stadium.jpg ) : 107,282 . 
  that this `` right to decide '' , if applied everywhere in europe , can lead to a [ patchwork ] ( http://artist1900.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/heiliges-roem-reich-1648.png ) of small nation-states . 
  moreover , since the eu is , in most respects , an incredibly weak institution - no unified fiscal , foreign , or immigration policy , no central government that acts as the supreme law of the land , no formal transfer payment system - the eu would break down as an effective organization , with the nation-states bickering amongst themselves in an effort to `` preserve their sovereignty '' . 
  the point is that political will the majority of people in * other regions * of spain may be different than the one you have , but that 's life . 
  the people in the south in the us often have completely different views than mine , and sometimes their opinion wins out in elections , but any talks of secession ( or kicking the southern states out ) is never regarded as a serious option just because they have a different view . 
  the idea of breaking off to form your own majority ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ blackjack ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ hookers not only sets a dangerous precedent for further balkanization in the eu , it 's also an unfair one as well - sure , you have the right to self-determination , but what happens to people in , say , madrid who are of the same political mindset as you ? 
  are they stuck with rajoy because they do n't belong to a people that have the `` right to decide '' ? 
  losing elections does n't mean that you do n't have anything left to do - there 's always the next election to work towards . 
  hell , 2004 was a ** dark ** time for liberals in the us : dubya got reelected , and he had both houses and the supreme court on his side . 
  but liberals did n't stop fighting , as they worked to get a democratic majority back into congress and the white house ( and the conservatives via the tea party did the same in 2008 ) . 
  what i 'm saying is , there 's always another fight you can make . 
  i think what he means is that the more entities there are in the eu , the higher the likelihood that there 's going to be bickering on a noticeable ( and ultimately hindering ) level , especially given how weak the eu is , structurally-speaking , right now . 
  and history has shown that this is a bad thing , with larger countries picking apart smaller , disorganized nation-states at their leisure - see the partitions of poland or how the british worked the indian states against each other to conquer the entirety of the sub-continent . 
   with the estatut and all the shit ** the pp ** has been throwing at us . 
  if your beef is with pp , then work to throw the pp out of power - or ( and i 'm asking seriously ) have the people in psoe and podemos been as much anti-catalan as people here are claiming about pp ? 
   you want to directly travel to new york ? 
  only in barajas , even though barcelona is usually a more visited city . 
  [ lolwut ] ( http://flights.expedia.com/flights-from-new-york-to-barcelona-jfk-to-bcn/ ), 
  this is straight-out projection from lavrov , given how much # 1 putin laments the fall of the soviet union , and # 2 russia prides itself as being not quite european , but not quite asian either - sounds like `` eternal uniqueness '' to me !, 
  i 've been hearing option 2 being thrown around , but nothing really concrete as to the desired results - what would mas and company hope to get out of that ? 
   muskovy was a vassal of the crimean khanate for its first 300 years . 
  maybe that 's why they are so hostile to the crimean tartars . 
  sorry , that 's just wrong . 
  the crimean khanate did n't even exist for the majority of the mongol yoke - it was one of the successors of the mongol empire ( which muscovy was actually subject to ) . 
  if there 's any beef that the russians would have against the crimean khanate , it 'd be them sacking moscow in the 1500s , but , by that logic , russia would hold a grudge against france as well . 
  chill out , bro . 
  fads come and go - remember the `` x 's of europe '' posts that were here a few weeks ago ? 
   is there any particular reason for compilation of war pictures of these two wars ? 
  ( am i missing something ?? ), 
  well , probably because they 're the two significant european wars of the 90s . 
  so , [ you took offense to that last one ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/itakeoffensetothatlastone ) ? 
  oh great , a new \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439 - more ammo for my theory that putin is not the next stalin , but rather the next brezhnev . 
  it 's ideal , yes , but it 's not going to happen , unfortunately . 
  otherwise , why would scotland/catalonia work so hard to be free of london/madrid , only to sacrifice that sovereignty to brussels ? 
  here 's a hint : find out which are the three richest regions in spain are , then take a look at which regions in spain want to declare independence . 
  you 'll find the lists are suspiciously similar . 
  yes , no referendum was held - and i hope that your opinion would not have been different had it actually occurred . 
  however , the basic principle stays the same : the confederate states , having found itself in the minority , questioned the majority 's right to govern . 
  even if they attempted to secede because of trade policy , saying that they could `` govern themselves '' better , it should n't have happened - a `` united states '' does n't mean much if states can withdraw so easily . 
  but this so-called `` tyranny of the majority '' is n't imposing any major human rights concerns in catalonia - if there were , then you can go to strasbourg and state your case there . 
  the system has the pp in power now , and the system can get people that favor policies that you favor in power as well if you work with other people in the country to elect them .
