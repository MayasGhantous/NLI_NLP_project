  the spanish government is `` attached to the pretty shape spain makes on a map '' just like most any government is attached to their own shape on the map - governments value territorial integrity immensely . 
  america would do the same thing if it were in spain 's position . 
  the people of the uk are fine with the referendum , apparently , since there are n't any major protests to get the government to withdraw its support . 
  but they 'd be perfectly in the right to want a country-wide referendum if they wanted - scotland is as much as their territory as the rest of the uk is for scotland . 
  likewise , you can move to galicia and be a part of the political system there as somebody from extremadura can move to catalonia and be a part of the system here . 
  there 's a reason why these unilateral declarations are dangerous : what will stop the people from the basque countries , then galicia , then andaluc\u00eda , then asturias , then valencia , then aragaon from conducting the same if they wanted ? 
  would you be fine with spain disintegrating into a patchwork of nation-states like germany was before unification in the 1800 's ? 
  and all of those movements that you mentioned - algeria , ireland , the rest of the americas , india , etc - involved people who had * no * representation in their governments , being colonies and imperial territories . 
  what `` tyranny '' is going on in spain ? 
  that you have to give more money to the capital in taxes than you get back ? 
  that 's what happens to any more affluent area in a redistribution system . 
  that the education system may be cutting back on catalan language education ? 
  if that 's really an attack on catalan culture , go to strasbourg and state your case there . 
  that you do n't agree with the general policies of the government ? 
  then work with other people in spain to get the political landscape changed ( e.g. 
  with podemos ) . 
  basically , what is happening in catalonia now that could n't happen if catalonia were to be `` self-governing '' ? 
  would you be fine with the governmental policies of mas if they were the exact same as rajoy 's or s\u00e1nchez 's ? 
  is it simply that the `` other '' people are having a say in the process ? 
  the difference is that america was a colony , so it was never an equal partner in the british empire to britain itself , only subservient ( legally-speaking , not in terms of population ) . 
  if the country was participating in an actual democracy with england and the uk , then maybe things would 've been different - we would have actually had `` taxation with representation '' . 
  i 'll put it this way : i support unilateral declarations of independence when there are clear human rights violations , such as what happened in kosovo - if this were 45 years ago , i would 've supported catalonia declaring independence from the franco regime , because the catalan people and culture were truly being repressed . 
  but now ? 
  yes , some education laws from the govt are questionable , but if they really are grossly violating the catalan culture , then there should be a recourse in the courts in strasbourg . 
  and if the central government , which has been elected by the people of all of spain , does not allow it , then the majority of the people do not want the referendum . 
  if you think that the current government does n't respect the will of the people of spain ( who may very well indeed want a referendum ) , then work with people across the country to elect a new government that * will * grant a referendum . 
  british might have been against it , but you could n't ask the americans in the same way that you could ask the british - they were subservient to the governors that the uk govt appointed . 
  and the idea that being a majority in one 's own territory allows for breaking away from a larger territory is , in the end , disrespectful of the views of the majority of citizens in spain . 
  i 'm saying this as an american , having quite a good knowledge of my country 's civil war that was fought because a majority in its own territory decided that they wanted to form their own country - to keep slavery , true , but the basic principle of democracy is that you respect the majority opinion , or else there 's no point in having a democracy at all . 
  * americans * did n't have a say in their own affairs - being a colony , they were subject to the whims of the governors that the british crown appointed . 
  how long before ^ ^ ^ stupid ^ ^ ^ sexy flanders starts piping up about independence from wallonia ? 
  if the vast majority of the spanish population is against the referendum , then the referendum should n't happen - that simple . 
  otherwise , what good is the rule of law if a minority can simply declare itself a new majority in its own territory ? 
  # 1 the spanish government represents the people of all of spain and its territory . 
  # 2 catalonia is wanting to secede , something that will affect the constitution of the spanish territory . 
  # 3 the people of a territory should have a say over questions regarding the constitution of their territory . 
  therefore : # 4 the spanish government should have a say over questions regarding the constitution of its territory . 
  then work with like-minded people across spain to get the government changed and set yourself up for a uk-style referendum . 
  sure , easier said than done , you 'll get a lot more legitimacy in the global stage than the current path . 
  four of the five top results : 1 ) catalan news agency 2 ) catalonia votes 3 ) help catalonia 4 ) catalan news monitor sure sound like bastions of impartiality to me, 
  yes , the culture is slowly being eroded . 
  no more announcements in the fgc in catalan , pla\u00e7a catalunya will soon be renamed plaza catalu\u00f1a , the castellers are being banned from performing ... and la diada ? 
  last i heard nobody 's going to show up tomorrow because they 're ashamed of holidays that do n't conform to castillian culture . 
  flanders , most likely . 
  all aboard the balkanization train !, 
  are they sure that the road rage thing was legit ? 
  that looks an awful lot like something trigger-happy tv would do . 
  rip headphones ... 
  yeah , i 'm going to put you down in the `` hawk '' column , then . 
  most likely . 
  it 's one of the strongest economic regions in spain ( behind madrid and , i think , the basque counties ) , plus it 's one of the two viable land trade routes connecting the iberian peninsula with the rest of europe ( along with a major port in barcelona ) . 
  of course , whether catalonia * should * declare independence , that 's a different question . 
    some people think zhirinovsky is only a jester but there is also another opinion : government use zhirinovsky to give population clues about possible development of situation in the future so people could `` digest '' certain ideas before they ** become reality ** ;  i live in romania and i really , really hope the ` other opinion ' is n't true . 
  99.999999 % sure that it is n't - zhirinovsky has been spewing this stuff for decades now without the `` results '' . 
  he - along with gennady zyuganov of the communist party - is part of the `` good cop/bad cop '' scheme in place to make putin look reasonable by comparison . 
  plus , the two are constantly allowed to participate in the presidential elections both to legitimize the elections and to put up the fa\u00e7ade to the rest of the world that putin is the only reasonable electable political figure in russian politics . 
  it 's not just mcdonalds . 
  wendys is [ pulling out ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-28/wendy-s-pulls-out-of-russia-after-franchisee-change.html ) as well . 
  guess it 's only \u0427\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u043e\u0436\u043a\u0430 and \u0422\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043a for those patriotic russians now ... 
  if the mcdonald 's thing is true , then that 's the second american chain to pull out of russia - [ wendys is pulling out as well ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-28/wendy-s-pulls-out-of-russia-after-franchisee-change.html ) . 
  well , they * did * invent the pilsner after all - it 's got ta be national pride !, 
  anybody from eesti care to comment on how your country is 4th ? 
  it 's not like you guys invented pilsner or have oktoberfest or anything ... 
  thanks , 3dom . 
  any update on the mastercard/visa issue ? 
  ** edit ** oh , and that abduction in pulkovo has some more details that make it a bit sketchier than what your link described . 
  apparently , the three were a guy from azerbaijan and two bodyguards , and they had a suitcase with [ $ 1.5 million dollars ] ( http://www.mr7.ru/articles/104366/ ) in it . 
  maybe this was mafia-related ? 
  it 's [ this guy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ahhki/russian_seeking_asylum_are_heading_to_kiev_heres/civeq0c ) . 
  yup , i immediately thought about you when i saw the article, 
  while i do n't doubt you - russia has been trying really hard to enact policies encouraging population growth - how many of those births are coming from immigrants ? 
  the country * does * get a lot of people emigrating from the central asian states , after all . 
   yeah , i am sure that game caused some heart attacks . 
  same as the first two games they played vs algeria & russia . 
  maybe they have some endorsement contract by a cardiac institute and need to `` deliver '' via really sketchy play ? 
  unfortunately , i fear that one of the biggest reasons why the independence movement is because of $ $ $ . 
  scotland is sitting on a big amount of oil , and why should it share that revenue with anyone else ? 
  sorry that sounds pretty blunt , but the fact that this was actually [ used ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/it%27s_scotland%27s_oil ) as a political slogan for independence earlier is pretty telling . 
  and that 's exactly how putin wants it : `` apr\u00e8s moi , la deluge '' . 
  there are plenty of meaningful opposition figures in russia that are n't batshit insane like zhirinovsky - navalnyy and udaltsov , for example - but they are n't allowed any serious means for contention precisely because they could pose a serious threat to putin 's regime . 
  if you 're talking about the communist party run by zyuganov , then i think that wo n't happen . 
  the fact that zyuganov has been leading the party in defeat after defeat in the presidential elections ( i.e. 
  nobody has taken him out of leadership in exchange for a credible opposition candidate ) leads me to believe that , like zhirinovsky , he 's being used as a useful stooge to show why putin should stay in power . 
  after all , we do n't want those commies/ultranationalists getting power !, 
  that 's the election cycle at work - the house and the senate do n't start their session until the beginning of the year after the election . 
  it 's an election scheme , nothing more . 
  we have it in the united states with republicans claiming that they 're going to get rid of abortion year after year . 
  however , despite having the white house , congress , and the supreme court from 2003-2007 ( i.e. 
  all three branches of the federal government ) , they did n't do much of anything besides a `` partial birth '' abortion ratified by the supreme court . 
  basically , the strategy is to not give up the electoral advantage , even if that means doing nothing . 
  regarding the visa/mastercard thing , how likely do you think this is to happen ? 
  i 'm heading there this august , and it 'd sure be nice to use credit cards instead of lugging rubles everywhere . 
  [ jeremy clarkson agrees ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sskkmbx6qmk ), 
    no-one will show up  heavily-armed concerned citizens , duh ftfy , comrade, 
   except it was n't really . 
  my family lived in moscow before we moved to the states in 1996 . 
  my father worked in a factory . 
  he says that the lines for food and bread only came after the ussr fell apart . 
  the key words there are `` lived in moscow '' . 
  the third rome has been the center of attention in russia for over a century - how much you want to bet that things in ulan-ude , nakhodka , or togliatti were n't as great as in moscow ?
