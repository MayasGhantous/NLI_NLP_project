  it 's not about russians - from every russian that i 've talked to ( including the one that i dated for three years ) , any russian that * can * get out , * does * get out . 
  this bill 's aimed at the migrants from central asia , for whom russia is genuinely a step up from the living conditions that they 've had in their own country . 
  so , you could say that this is a reflection of the debate that 's going on in the us . 
  russia needs to address both its dwindling population and the high number of illegal immigrants in the country , and this bill would help to patch up both problems . 
  stopped reading when the author proposed `` bolivarianization '' ( i.e. 
  a hugo chavez-style government ) . 
  the author * does * realize that the chavistas have turned that country into a smouldering trainwreck due to horribly mismanaging their abundance of oil , right ? 
  kosovo was subject to ethnic cleansing and genocide . 
  please , tell me where this repression is happening here in catalonia . 
  not only have i not seen any death squads roaming the streets , catalan is thriving . 
  the language is spoken everywhere , official signs and announcements are in catalan first ( if there 's even a separate announcement in castellano ) , and catalan culture is displayed openly on the street . 
    and now european government will accept it either . 
   why would you assume that ? 
  because this is an affluent region of a nation wanting to declare independence . 
  say that catalonia does secede - who 's to say `` no '' to flanders , bavaria , north italy , or any other affluent part of a country ? 
  if catalonia can do it , then it 'll be in any rich region 's economic interest to declare the `` right to decide '' and set up their own nation . 
  indeed , to * really * be effective , the us should start applying embargoes where it 'll really hurt , such as us music like tupac . 
  moscow will be in flames within a week . 
   can you give some examples of these areas ? 
  i know kazachstan is one but i doubt russia would invade their ally . 
  there 's lots of them in the baltic countries . 
  latvia even has stripped citizenship from russian speakers who refused to learn latvian , so russia 's already got its `` our people are oppressed ! '', 
  narrative pre-made and ready to go . 
  also , russian is practically the lingua franca in belarus , so whenever lukashenko gets toppled or anything like that , in swoops russia to `` protect '' the shit out of the country . 
   remember post 9/11 america , where if you spoke out against the military in the wrong neighbourhood there was a high chance of something bad happening to you ? 
  well , put that against a backdrop of economic collapse . 
  but that 's my point : america had a relatively-decent economy in the run-up to afghanistan and iraq , and the economy did n't take a hit because of either . 
  i do n't doubt putin 's ability to line his pockets , but the men behind the throne surely have to be a bit worried about their holdings losing half their value overnight , and the government running out of money because of the ruble crashing would undoubtedly be bad - the whole crisis in ukraine , after all , started due to yanukovich trying to prevent the ukrainian government from becoming insolvent . 
  it 's not strictly military per se - it refers to the [ web brigades ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web_brigades ) that the kremlin is reported to have employed . 
  unsurprisingly , the kind of pro-russia defense has been everywhere on reddit for the past few months . 
  read through some of the more popular threads ; this kind of stuff will eventually start to stick out , as they all say variations of the same lines ( `` kosovo !, 
  tough to hear about your sister . 
  it might help to show her the wikipedia pages i mentioned and maybe any such comments from the georgia invasion to show her that what he 's saying is just the same \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e with a different wrapper . 
  you have any idea why putin would think that 's a good idea ? 
  the moment they invade ukraine , the financial world 's going to smash the moscow exchange to pieces , and i do n't think the kremlin has enough foreign reserves to prop up the ruble for very long . 
  i 've always viewed russia 's actions as having an end goal of keeping putin in power , and i do n't see how invading would help that . 
  is he closer to the grave than we know and is in a dash to cement his stalin-esque legacy before the grim reaper shows up ? 
   everytime someone blames russian media to be mere putin propaganda instruments , a whole lot of people rushes in and starts saying the same about western media . 
  but during this whole ukraine/maidan/crimea stuff i noticed that all the things the western media reported was really close to what i saw on twitter and social networks , unfiltered , unaltered by anyone . 
  that 's because it 's the standard operating procedure for defending russia 's ( and , previously , the soviet union 's ) actions . 
  01 : is there an example of wrongdoing on the side of the people criticizing , no matter how superficial or out of context it is ? 
  trumpet that ( otherwise known as known as [ whataboutism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) or [ `` and you are lynching negroes !, 
  '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) ) 02 : ca n't find any examples ? 
  no worries - just say that the article/criticism in question is `` western/anti-russian propaganda '' . 
  that 's basically how you can find a '' \u0411\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a '' : never actually defends russia 's actions , just says points out others or says that the criticism is out of context . 
   i really do n't understand why serbians are so unabashedly pro-russian , can someone explain it ? 
  religion - the two countries are both orthodox, 
   to me putin is really somewhere between thatcher and obama evil-wise . 
  maybe a bit more evil than reagan , but still not quite as evil as fujimori . 
  * between * the two ? 
  he 's a hell of a lot worse than either of those . 
  thatcher got the boot from her party , and obama 's going to be out of power in 2017 . 
  do you think putin 's got any plan of relinquishing power in russia ? 
  the only way i see him leaving the kremlin is in a coffin , either due to natural causes or via a bullet to the brain . 
  not to mention developing the personality cult , the komsomol-esque nashi organization , and these blatant attacks on the media . 
  there 's also the more colorful variant on this : [ `` and you are lynching negroes !, 
  '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ), 
  the english did have a say in it , vis-a-vis the central government approving the process . 
  if people were n't for the referendum , you 'd surely find them protesting or trying to vote out cameron 's govt . 
   according to that linked wiki page for oliven\u00e7a , spain 's annexation is legal as per a peace treaty keep reading that wiki page :  portugal claims the de jure sovereignty over olivenza exactly evoking the same treaty of badajoz , since it was revoked by its own terms ( the breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation ) when spain invaded portugal in the peninsular war of 1807 . 
  portugal further bases its case on article 105 of the treaty of vienna of 1815 , which spain signed in 1817 , that states that the winning countries are to `` endeavour with the mightiest conciliatory effort to return olivenza to portuguese authority '' . 
  thus , the border between the two countries in the region of olivenza should be as demarcated by the treaty of alcanizes of 1297 . 
  any comment on why they were throwing watermelons ? 
  was there a discount at \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 or something ? 
  `` you criticize russia ? 
  well , here 's something * your * country does bad ! '', 
  lives on . 
  well , ireland went through some rather ... unpleasant times in regards to splitting , so i do n't know how great an example it is for catalonia . 
  [ everything is just so remarkable in poland !, 
  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/6e/09/68/6e0968f9c1edffad3044f5e30311d1f0.jpg ), 
  slight correction : his term that started in 2012 is for six years , so he 'd be `` standing '' for re-election in 2018 , meaning he 'd be president until 2024 . 
  is anybody else a little freaked out at how this almost sounds a lot like the plane crash scene from mi :2 ? 
  windmills , in spain 's case , is referring to don quijote . 
  what i find really interesting about spain is how its `` national stereotype '' does n't exist as one actual place in the country . 
  germany 's is bavaria ( e.g. 
  lederhosen , oktoberfest ) , whereas france 's is paris or the french riviera . 
  but spain ? 
  ask an american , and they 'll say : * flamenco ( andalusia ) * running of the bulls ( pamplona , which is in navarra ) * sangria ( unknown , but possibly [ invented by the english ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cocinillas.es%2f2014%2f01%2fel-confuso-origen-de-la-sangria%2f&amp;edit-text= ) ) * windmills ( castile-la mancha ) * paella ( valencia ) as such , i got a chuckle when i saw a big french tour group in cordoba ( andalusia ) getting a big pan of paella in the restaurant my friend and i were eating in - it would 've been like getting new england clam chowder in florida and expecting that it was the `` real deal '' . 
  edit : just to clear things up : i 'm not saying that spanish stereotypes cover * every * region like asturias or the canary islands , nor am i saying that there 's not one region you can attribute most of the stereotypes to . 
  i agree that andalusia is home to quite a few spanish stereotypes , but there 's a lot more - like manchego cheese , which comes from la mancha - that are spread throughout the country . 
  what i 'm saying is that countries like germany have their stereotypical image stemming from practically just one region , something which is n't the case in spain . 
  not to mention blocking macedonia just because of the country 's name ... 
  for those who do n't understand russian : panel 1 : `` ruble , we 're falling too fast ! '', 
  panel 2 : `` what 's on the instruments ? '', 
  panel 3 : `` stress is almost at maximum , but she 's still holding ! '', 
  panel 4 : fwoosh panel 5 : `` what was that ? '', 
  `` i do n't know ... '', 
  linguistics question : when swedes and danes are meeting like this , how do you guys talk ? 
  do you need an interpreter , or can you get along just talking in your own languages ? 
  i 'm living in barcelona , known both for the amount of russians that come here on vacation and for having a big separatist movement against the national government . 
  there 's a joke in there somewhere ... 
  are you an american ? 
  because if so , the us and russia signed an agreement that makes it much easier ( re automatic , if i 'm not mistaken ) to get a [ three-year visa ] ( http://waytorussia.net/russianvisa/3-year-russian-visa-us-citizens.html ) . 
  that 'd mean being able to go there until 2019 whenever you wanted . 
  and whose self-determination is that ? 
  the catalans voting for an independent territory ? 
  what about people who are n't catalan - do they not get to vote ? 
  what about the people who vote no , yet the majority votes yes - would those people lose a citizenship that they had no desire to give up ? 
  how about the other residents of spain , considering that catalunya is as much theirs as galicia or andalusia belong to the residents of catalunya - should n't those people have a say on whether they 'll be giving up a part of their country ? 
  the question is a lot more complicated than romantic phrases like `` dret a decidir '' portray it .
