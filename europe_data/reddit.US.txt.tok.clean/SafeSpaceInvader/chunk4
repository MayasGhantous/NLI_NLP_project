  ( they are all breaking the law since they refuse to be registered in the first safe country , but besides that most of them are male ) . 
  as all non-racists know , diversity is worth paying any price !, 
  you may have a point , i ca n't think of many good counterexamples . 
  i guess for a recent example i would say gorbachev and yeltsin are not viewed favorably ( mostly not talked about at all anymore ) in the west despite them leading the way in the economic liberalization of russia . 
  ( in our camp of the saints situation ) i suspect mama merkel will be mostly forgotten alongside the other european politicians who precipitated this crisis . 
  the narrative will be that these brave new europeans deserved to own europe , and that their eventual victory is the fruit of their labor . 
  nobody will remember those who opened the gates in the first place . 
  i mean , there obviously was n't anything bad enough european immigration to america for the people living there . 
  it made it more diverse !, 
  the natives were tired of their boring old cuisine , and then they got to sample all the different kinds of cooking new wonderful europeans brought with them !, 
   it 's funny how history always looks back at anti-immigration types as monsters and pro-immigration types as having a bit of human decency . 
  that 's why we celebrate christopher columbus !, 
   the most important thing for the eu and germany is the trust in treaties and the sticking to our values , if we become lazy with that , we will also lose the third aim - the well being of its peoples . 
  germany does n't have a people you racist . 
  a german is no different from a syrian - all belong in germany . 
  i 've never been asked in person , but i hope i remember to say `` thanks , it 's still working . '', 
   meanwhile , no one seems to notice that corporate greed ( not brown people ) is crushing the middle class what will millions of new europeans do for middle and low class wages ? 
  lol greeks are n't supposed to be here either , they 're racist european invaders like yourself . 
  you fucking nazi . 
  you should have a native american family stay in your apartment , you goddam racist . 
   even reddit 's favorite bernie `` anti-1 % '' sanders fails to recognize the effect of illegal migration on america 's poorest citizens . 
  i think the major politicians on both sides know exactly what they 're doing . 
  the mainstream gop want more cheap labor to keep wages low . 
  the mainstream dems want more minorities who will vote for them . 
   we stole this land from the indians give yours back . 
   you talk of riots as if its a bad thing uhhhh, 
  history generally is n't kind to collaborators , even if their masters win . 
  only because anything less than full enthusiasm for millions of refugees arriving every year is considered to be far right . 
  additionally ( at least in the us , i speculate it 's similar in europe ) people who are divorced once are more likely to divorce again . 
  it 's the only way to not be racist . 
  well gee , i guess we need to change how things work because somebody got their feelings hurt . 
  look at the top of this reddit post m8 . 
  `` tax '' features pretty prominently in the title guess i should n't be surprised a brit ** bong ** is having such problems though . 
   puritan lol you really do n't know anything about burgerland keep dodging those grenades sven :d, 
  ayyyy lmao, 
  i 'm sorry , you 're right . 
  your comment was irrelevant from the start . 
       i could n't imagine another country in the world also banning their own national flag in a school , and then there is this guy saying there is no swedish culture etc etc. 
  this happens in some places in the us too , though there are more places where we 're resisting it . 
  your media also thinks you 've received 800,000 14 year old girl civil engineers , so i should n't be surprised . 
  new orleans and downtown baltimore are not no-go areas . 
  maybe we 're just not as big a bunch of cowards as you swedes though . 
  the whole thread is about government revenue . 
  which is funny , because in which country are you more likely to be grenaded by somalis ? 
   thecannibist.co lol they 've smoked themselves retarded ( or maybe you did ) . 
  you 're conflating total sales with government revenue . 
   which is the problem because the enviroment is n't suited to do that what is wrong with them that they ca n't assimilate to where they * voluntarily chose to move to * ? 
  it 's the only way for those evil germans to stop being racist . 
       imagine if a muslim person broke one of our laws after living here for 25 years and his government tried to intervene . 
  we 'd be furious . 
  yeah , they usually start breaking the laws a lot sooner ... 
  wow , it 's very rare to see so many phd holders marching together like that . 
   it is , however , not the best place to take a walk in the middle of the night on a friday ... that 's the definition of a no-go area in the us m8 . 
   and loss of identity if they 're assimilating , they * have * to lose their identity , to have it replaced by the host country 's . 
  that 's the whole point !, 
  they made $ 60m in 420 blaze it taxes last year . 
  their 2015 budget is about $ 29b . 
   and your point is that the amount of money we 're wasting is not large so we should continue wasting it ? 
  it literally does n't matter . 
  that 's a fault with our oversized societies , but it 's also the truth . 
  it 's like if you change your 10-views-per-month blog 's background to black to save the environment by reducing energy consumption . 
  it does n't matter . 
  if it will increase revenue by $ 10 that 's technically a point in it 's favor but if you want to be taken seriously you wo n't bother bringing it up . 
  the money being talked about is basically irrelevant . 
  lol `` i would 've expected to be physically assaulted by these people already , instead they 're only using the courts to attack my country '', 
  `` hundreds of millions of pounds '' ie a rounding error in the yearly budget . 
  potheads should stick to the parts of their case that make sense . 
  it 's astounding to me how the supposedly progressive left does n't see this . 
  as long as ethnic europeans are hurt it 's ok to work with big business to crush labor , apparently . 
  only 20 years experience , not 30 . 
   no , it 's what we do except for the 10-30m people from the southern border ... 
   ( since there is n't any to begin with ) ayyy lmao you have n't seen how california has changed m80, 
  lol and it 's not good for us either, 
   if politicians wanted to lower wages for unskilled workers , they 'd just lower the legal minimum wage . 
  but now there 's no chance a low or semi-skilled worker can ever hope to earn more than minimum wage . 
   the bad thing about religion is that it is detremental to scientific progress . 
   a ** stringnet ** pan-european asylum system that weeds out the ** undesirables ** wow you racist monster, 
  those evil racist boring old swedes should be evicted to make room for these much better brand new swedes . 
  that 's weird , why would 14-year old girl astrophysicists try to kidnap anyone ? 
   as opposed to what ? 
  german and italian americans ? 
  polish americans ? 
  we made those folks speak english and read shakespeare . 
  that was before we realized speaking english was hella racist and we do n't make anybody speak it anymore . 
  it 's a shame when one muslim nation lectures another . 
  what ever happened to unity ? 
  our recent arrivals feel no kinship with england , because there is literally no kinship . 
   i do n't know what to say . 
  lol implying the people surrendering to unarmed refugees would resist mean old putin armies and borders are really problematic, 
  this stuff always kills me . 
  if you 're opposed to a foreign country having a demographic stake in your democracy you 're a racist monster . 
  is it still a conspiracy if it 's openly discussed ? 
  so worried you 'll even grumble a little as you go out and vote for the merk . 
  is n't diversity wonderful !, 
  and these kinds of people will be the ones educating millions of new europeans every year . 
   legislation is produced by democratically elected officials and enforced by courts , is n't it ? 
  it 's enforced by the executive branch ( though in parliamentarian setups that is effectively the same as the legislature ) . 
   the us takes proportionately many more migrants , and integrates them so much better . 
  lol, 
  daily reminder the left is working hand in hand with global plutocrats on diversifying europe .
