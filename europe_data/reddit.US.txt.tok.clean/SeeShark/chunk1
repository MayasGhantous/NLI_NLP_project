i 'm not sure why you think there 's something `` great '' about empires . 
  the classicists did , but there 's not much to back it up . 
  and as for the assertion that nothing much was invented in europe during the middle ages , you 'd have to be ignoring the heavy plough , the hourglass , the blast furnace , eyeglasses , the mechanical clock , horseshoes , the floating crane , the wheelbarrow , the clothing button , the grindstone , plate armor , and many others . 
  they even made advances in medicine , like the invention of quarantine . 
  and even the printing press was invented before the traditional start of the renaissance . 
  so basically , no . 
  the renaissance is about 95 % pure romanticism based on the idea that empires somehow advance human culture and technology faster than whatever replaces them , which is not supported by history .

  sharia * is * political islam , though . 
  / r/nocontext, 
   `` obamas_war_cock '' what was your first clue ? 
  i get what you 're saying , but the concept of the `` dark ages '' as centuries of stagnation and stasis has been mostly debunked by modern historians . 
  the concept derives from renaissance thinkers fetishizing greco-roman culture and deciding that after the fall of rome barbarism clearly ruled . 
  this is despite the numerous advancements in technology that occurred during that era , and the fact that the `` renaissance '' was n't as big a leap forward as they liked to believe . 
  [ wikipedia because i ca n't be arsed to find a proper source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark_ages_%28historiography%29 ), 
  historically the world has never given them a very good reason to, 
  telegraphing his intentions for the country loud and clear !, 
  absolutely !, 
  the reason this leak is a major event is because people care about ethics as much as , if not more , the letter of the law . 
   it 's dubious whether he has broken any laws or not but that 's kind of the point . 
  very little of what 's happening is actively illegal - but it 's all very unethical . 
  upvoting just for the use of the word `` thrice . '', 
  \\ #bringitback, 
  perfect , thanks, 
  there should be a mega thread for this leak somewhere . 
   official backing in the form of sports as befits the scottish national anthem, 
   full version mentions how we should kill russians i 'm not even kind of surprised . 
  is romania pretty serious about its latin origins as opposed to all the slavs and such around them ? 
  it 's okay , in a decade or two you 'll be singing about the king instead . 
  the way i 've heard it : * the norwegians make fun of the swedes * the swedes make fun of the norweigians * both make fun of the danish * all three kind of try to avoid talking about the finnish, 
   or welshman , if we 're feeling charitable i believe that 's how the nordics feel about finland, 
  meanwhile , israel 's anthem is just `` please just leave us alone we do n't want to fight anybody q.q '' ( there are , of course , some israeli politicians that might need to hear it more often ), 
  as an israeli , i certainly understand this kind of ambiguity . 
  i believe i will !, 
  historically , oppression has been a great breeder of comedy . 
  that 's a good point - either way is an illogical emotional response ( also similar to not traveling anywhere in `` ebola-infested '' africa ) . 
  i guess not changing your habits * is * the logical response . 
  i never said `` reincarnation of hitler '' ( and being jewish , i likely never will ) . 
  but there * are * striking similarities between the rhetorics employed by both that can not be waved away . 
  ah good , you saved me the trouble of responding myself and getting into a day-long argument . 
  never thought about it in so many words !, 
  it 's interesting , what parallel histories can do to parallel peoples . 
  come to think of it , considering the british-japanese similarities , we should go look for some ainu friends . 
  i figured it was something along those lines , but my french is not strong enough for slang . 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  he does n't see the problem any `` clearer , '' he was trying to divert attention away from oppression of kurds by accusing the west of supporting kurdish terrorists . 
  me : how can you tell if a given muslim is radical , though ? 
  yeah , they should instead vote for a fascist who promises to make belgium great again !, 
  never realized us jews had so much in common with the irish . 
  i understand the desire to `` not let them win , '' but at the same time i understand people who value their safety higher than a symbolic defiance . 
  i feel like i 'm missing a pun, 
  he 's here to push his agenda , not discuss the actual events, 
  own it !, 
  own the lemming !, 
  you 'd have to also count pre - and post - caesar as the same government , which is equally debatable . 
  like i said , it 's very much a matter of definitions . 
  wikipedia says `` flemish '' is the adjective and `` fleming '' is the demonym . 
  and the word is funny as hell ( because it sounds like `` lemming '' ) so i 'm using it . 
  fuck , i got the flag sideways and a bit mixed . 
  my bad . 
  i seriously feel like an ignorant american right now ... as a non-native american , i already knew about belgium , so i ca n't attest to general trends except to say they opened a godiva in the local mall a few years back and everyone seems to be drinking blue moon all the time . 
  so i guess you 're right . 
  i also do n't have much data on belgian ( and especially flemish ) english-speaking prowess , so i 'm forced to generalize from you . 
  from now on i 'm going to assume all flemings ( is that seriously a real term ? 
  amazing ) are excellent speakers of english and be very disappointed when proven wrong . 
  let me know if you want some northwest context on anything . 
  suuuuuuure you do n't . 
  do n't worry , i can keep a secret . 
   glad to know you were n't * entirely * serious , because if people thought california and texas were basically the same i 'd have to start questioning the level of education in europe ( and as an american that would make me an uninformed , ignorant hypocrite , more so than usual ) . 
  i wanted to draw a comparison between washington and texas but frankly i recognize that most people do n't even know washington exists ( hint : it 's where seattle is ) and definitely do n't know anything about its culture . 
  always a pleasure to read english written by a german . 
  y' all tend to be terribly eloquent . 
  edit : well fuck my sideways , i got the flag all rotated and such in my head . 
   you guys seem to come across as firmly united towards the world hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha ahem . 
  while there is certainly an american identity , it absolutely does not imply any sort of unity among all those who share it . 
  i think that 's part of the misconception - people assume that a european identity will come with conformity , when it really is n't the case . 
  and in reality the identity itself is probably expressed and felt differently in different places . 
  but most americans do n't really know the differences between various european countries , or various southeast asian countries , or even various south american countries ( they 're all `` mexicans '' in many people 's common parlance ) . 
  so i 'm not really surprised the us comes across as more uniform than it really is . 
  ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ believe ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ meant ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ say ^ ^ ^ `` depth '', 
  i honestly would n't say the roman empire fell violently . 
  it kind of collapsed in terms of infrastructure but most of it was n't really ravaged by war or anything , it just kept going as the byzantine empire . 
  which was certainly a different country , but there was a lot of non-violent continuity . 
  i would n't say * any * currently existing state . 
  depending on how you define a continuous state , countries like england and japan have existed for a pretty long time . 
  and i believe the pax romana lasted only a couple of centuries , and the roman empire proper really only lasted less than 400-500 years before being replaced by the byzantine empire and the short-lived western roman empire . 
  but generally speaking i agree with your argument . 
  to be fair , so is the total number . 
  you need to look at percentages . 
  i do n't know what the statistics are and i 'm not making a claim for either side . 
  the us did n't fall all that quickly if memory serves, 
  yes , i imagine there are a few countries in the east that are n't too keen on a big central government after their recent soviet experiment . 
  i resent you generalization about all american whites . 
  `` homogeneity '' in this context refers partially to race , that is true , but it also refers to faraway states with different levels of economic success ( california does n't want to pay to prop up mississippi any more than they already do , and germany is n't too happy to donate its taxes to greece either ) . 
  and even if it was 100 % racist , most people are n't using that sort of language . 
  the reason trump is so successful ( and keep in mind that his success still represents only about 12-15 % of the american public ) is due to the republican party currently undergoing a candidate collapse because its most powerful politicians do n't represent the majority of its voters properly ( vis-a-vis immigration policy , trade policy , social policy , foreign intervention policy , etc. ), 
  and he 's seen as the guy who 's willing to voice their concerns . 
  yes , those concerns are racial in nature for many of them , but they do n't even represent a majority of the republican party , much less the entire country . 
  the greatest conflicts in the us have always been about social and economic policy , which could definitely become a problem for europe down the line . 
  imagine , for example , the conflict between a federal government that wants to universally allow the free practice of religion , while its second-most-powerful member state would like to forbid all public displays of religious faith .
