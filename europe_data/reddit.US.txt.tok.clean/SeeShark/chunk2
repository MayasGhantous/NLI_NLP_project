  would you force that state to change , or make the matter `` up to the individual states '' ? 
  if you choose the latter , you will have protests from other member states down the line about oppression of religion in their union . 
  if you choose the former , you have france threatening secession . 
  figuring out a gigantic federal system for social legislation is a lot trickier than smaller bodies with fewer fundamental differences in culture might realize . 
  but that 's how the us worked for the most part . 
  other than the original 13 colonies/states ( some of which did n't join entirely willingly ) , every single state has had to petition and be accepted . 
  they went through this process because they believed it would be of benefit to them at the time . 
  whether it turned out okay or not is a separate argument i 'm not trying to get into . 
  can vouch . 
  my american identity does not clash with my cascadian identity ( nor with my israeli one , for that matter ) . 
  you did basically make up the us just to annoy britain that one time, 
  colloquially ; literally , it still means the same thing . 
  hoooo boy . 
  no , it is not . 
  it means exactly what it means everywhere else . 
  people often accidentally write `` australia '' when they mean `` austria '' and vice-versa , hence this situation . 
  ah , so they have no zoos ? 
  nice . 
  maybe they should ask the people on twitter which country australia should build a fence around . 
  no need to be offensive when everybody knows it stands for `` clueless news network . '', 
  ah yes , the famous sydnerschnitzel . 
  til austria has abolished zoos . 
  good on them . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ need ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ put ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ after ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ post ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ worthy ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it, 
  ironic , all things considered, 
  i mean , he was a bit of a douche , but not that big of a douche . 
  i 'm starting to suspect language families are a thing, 
  according to highly scientific research ( wikipedia ) proto-slavic was still being used in the 9th century , and old high german appeared in the 8th century . 
  so that transfer is plausible . 
  i think the royalty were and then the english nobility started with the french to fit in with the popular kids . 
  ( correct me if i 'm wrong , though ), 
  the part about the american romantic view of the roma is accurate . 
  also , we still use the word `` gypsy '' extensively . 
  both of these facts irk the local roma , but there are very few of them and nobody really notices . 
  makes sense . 
  thanks for the clarification !, 
  thanks . 
  well , there were certainly varying degrees of collaboration . 
  in some countries , like poland , the population itself was fairly antisemitic and jewish losses were greater then even in germany . 
  norway and sweden basically agreed with most of what hitler was saying and tried not to think about jews too hard . 
  on the other side of the spectrum , finland actually officially allied with germany and still flat-out refused to participate in the holocaust . 
  it even had jewish soldiers fighting on the same side as the nazis for a while in the continuation war . 
  so i have no idea about the dutch specifically , but it 's not out of the question . 
  of course , / u/sethex should absolutely cite sources before throwing accusations around . 
  \\  seeshark ends his post without providing any sources, 
  i mean , my cousins got beat up in school ( regularly ) for being jewish , but you probably know better than i do , being `` a touch jewish '' and all . 
  in / r/europe ? 
  perish the thought !, 
  yeah , somehow jews always end up being the canary , but then nobody notices when the canary dies and the miners choke anyway . 
  pardon me , what is `` hbtq '' ? 
  as a fellow liberal , i think the best way to approach this problem is to recognize that some conservative complaints are rooted in real societal issues . 
  coming to a common understanding of certain problems can be a stepping stone to better cooperation . 
  the snatch `` gypsies '' are n't actual gypsies , per se . 
  especially in countries like bulgaria , `` gypsy '' refers to ethnic romani people ( / u/litrallytitler , please correct me if i 'm wrong [ i ca n't believe i just typed that sentence ] ) . 
  the `` gypsies '' in snatch are pikeys , or irish travellers , which is an ethnic group , possibly celtic in origin , that is distinct from other irish people . 
  i think you misunderstood , they actively choose to put them in the better schools by suing the city when they 're put in the bad ones . 
  the us has a very similar issue , except the shit schools are less for immigrants and more for racial minorities . 
  it 's slightly more complex - the actual notion is `` islam is n't bad as a whole so reporting on this trend accurately is ill-advised because it would create backlash against all muslims . '', 
  more nuanced , but still naive . 
  not sure this clip furthers the conversation but it 's one of the best scenes in one of the best movies ever . 
  so i ai n't complaining . 
  i 'm not going to call you brainwashed because i 'm not an internet edgelord douchebag . 
  i just question why you think it 's sometimes malicious and sometimes not . 
  i mean no offense , but you 're basically saying you think rt is fine except when you notice it 's being malicious . 
  that should make you at least suspect that at other times you just do n't detect the malice and fall for it . 
  let me tell you about / r/worldpolitics ... 
  thing is , it 's not just one data point . 
  it was the most horrific , emotional , and controversial data point because of the whole `` 30-hour rapefest '' thing . 
  other rapes are obviously still bad , but this story served to dehumanize all migrants in a more extreme way . 
  it 's a good thing that it 's false . 
  1914-1918 , and then 1939-1945 . 
  you know , when we were allied and needed to change the narrative . 
   tabloid diplomacy never heard this term before , but it 's great . 
  and the us , for that matter ( rt ), 
   people should not be having sex with 13 year olds to begin with unless those people are also 13 , of course, 
  in the 1900 's us it would 've been black people . 
  actually also in the 2000 's . 
  i think / u/15243asd1 has seen a screenshot of a tumblr blog saying that we should always side with purported rape victims without question and now assumes this is the majority liberal view . 
  you should be able to just add more \\ ^ 's every time . 
  use ^ one , ^ ^ then ^ ^ two , ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ forth, 
  different person , bro, 
  that sounds like it could be a reasonable definition , but it 's not the only possibility . 
  i want to know how the study defines it . 
  i do n't entirely disagree - those are both fairly vague concepts in much of europe . 
  by `` can '' i mean `` have the potential to , '' meaning there could be a swiss person who speaks four languages and yet speaks no `` foreign '' languages ( if they speak the four official national languages ) . 
  english is n't an official language in belgium to my knowledge , so it alone could explain this . 
  it 's possible dutch , french and german all count as `` local languages , '' so anyone who speaks even 1 foreign language might speak 4 total . 
  how do you define `` foreign language '' ? 
  because swiss people can speak four languages without any of them being foreign . 
  this is more likely `` people who speak x languages beyond their first . '', 
  edit : or maybe not , i have no idea . 
  that 's why i 'd like to know what the data represents exactly . 
  do you have a source on finns preferring negative responses ? 
  because it would be hilariously stereotypical but it 's still a pretty big claim . 
  in america , `` going dutch '' means splitting a restaurant check fifty-fifty . 
  / r/civpolitics, 
  stop making us look bad, 
  holy crap . 
  denmark 's highest point might very well be a building . 
  greenland is cheating .
