  nice try , denmark !, 
  i did n't consider that aspect . 
  interesting . 
  i 'm really hoping you do n't mean the united states right now because it 's silly to compare half a continent to ... well , denmark . 
  edit : whoops , missed the lack of `` r. '', 
  i was going to say `` the same way we navigate in mississippi when away from the river '' but it appears that mississippi has much higher points than denmark . 
  ... denmark 's highest point is 170 meters ? 
  even * mississippi * has higher points that that !, 
  nah , they 'd just get around it by adding `` the truth will shock you ! '', 
  after the question mark . 
  glad to know this law has a name, 
  it 's all good !, 
  i 'm flying the flag of where i currently live , so it 's understandable if my intent did n't come across . 
  i was attempting to mock the taliban 's claim , not the attack . 
  i 'm sorry if it came across as insensitive - i grew up in a country with regular terror attacks and know what that 's like . 
  `` no , really , guys , we 're still relevant ! '', 
  `` this person does n't have dutch flair !, 
  how do i know they 're dutch ? '', 
  \\* reads username \\* `` carry on , sir/madame . '', 
  i feel like the blue section should be in the middle . 
  one out of a thousand , while not representative , is far from `` a drop in the ocean . '', 
  yes , and there 's like eight near the top of the page with variations on this thought . 
  it might very well be true , but saying it has just become a trite refrain that people get tired of hearing . 
  europe is already going far-right . 
  this could certainly exacerbate the trend , though . 
  it 's had its share before the first attack . 
  these things just should not happen . 
   so it 's subsection of a subsection of a religion sunni is the vast majority of muslims , though . 
  and wahhabism/salafism is not by any means a fringe group - according to the page you linked :  most sunni qataris are wahhabis ( 46.87 % of all qataris ) [ 22 ] and 44.8 % of emiratis are wahhabis i 'm not saying wahhabism ( and particularly the extremists within * that * group ) represent all muslims , but there are literally millions of them . 
  i 'm not familiar with indonesian or bangladeshi politics , but did you mean `` islamists '' ( people who believe in islam as the basis for government ) or `` muslims '' ( people who follow the religion of islam ) ? 
  no , we do not . 
  there is currently speculation that they are muslim extremists because of an alleged `` allahu akbar '' shout . 
  nothing concrete confirmed yet , as far as i know . 
  almost point-by-point what bush said on 9/11 . 
  do n't let this be another 9/11 . 
  politicians are like an emergency food stash . 
  they 're mostly useless and if you ignore them for too long they start to go bad and stink up the place , but occasionally trouble comes along that nothing else can adequately deal with . 
  according to current information , nobody got hurt . 
  people really tend to forget how religious freedom works . 
  you can do anything according to your religion unless it violates a law , as long as that law was n't put in place specifically to restrict religious expression . 
  demanding anything more is n't religious freedom , it 's demanding special treatment under the law . 
  if it 's a joke , i ai n't laughing . 
  born in israel , living in us . 
  so , us via israel . 
  do i ? 
  i set my flair to the american flag with `` via israel '' as the hover text . 
  do you see something different ? 
  i would 've personally gone with `` beaver drool '' or `` moose jizz , '' but i respect your choice of animal . 
  i live in the us ... 
   why have i read it in trump 's voice ? 
  because i fully intended you to . 
  well , many magic attacks ignore armor , but not ac altogether , and usually not shields ( and let me tell you , mine is huge ) . 
  besides , with that tank hp i 'm sporting , i can take a few hits before unleashing my full attack on you . 
  should n't have gotten this close . 
  you do n't strike me as a particularly uninformed australian . 
  quite the contrary . 
  technically , full plate does n't apply a penalty to initiative ... but i would n't be wearing it if my dexterity was high . 
  : / oh well , come break your weapons against my 21 ac !, 
  i hate that `` kebab '' has become the ethnic slur for middle easterners . 
  i really like kebabs . 
  reality has always been its own best satire . 
  gulenist neo is about to go on a really cool slow-motion shooting spree, 
   1968 good choice . 
  hell of a year . 
  not really , just a bit nonsensical . 
  there are lots of humans who are idiots . 
   some tinfoiler it 's basically common opinion now ( at least on reddit ) . 
  not if the government responded with nwcavertingoureyes . 
  try watching american cable news . 
  tangent : seeing the word `` coup '' right after the word `` cup '' made me mispronounce it in my head . 
   secret cloud level took me a moment . 
  you 're a terrible person . 
  is n't that the sims ? 
  more like `` prank somerville , '' am i right ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ wrong, 
  news getting trolled , as mentioned by [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4vxqza/turkish_television_shows_secret_codes_from_the/d62b9p2 ) . 
  there 's a difference between falling for this type of trolling and trolling yourself , but that 's probably why people enjoyed the comment . 
  do n't worry , we have equally stupid new sources that report things like `` dragon age is a purely pornographic game '' literally without actually installing the game . 
   no one had seen the lord of the rings in the court room . 
  that part made me the saddest . 
  i think it 's because you offered him a beer but served him a can of eagle piss . 
  shame the brits are leaving the free trade zone ... they had some top-notch humor exports . 
  it certainly would n't be weirder than current german porn ... 
  good thing i always have dice within reach ... holy shit , i got a 13 !, 
  in your face , i go first . 
  weird . 
  never heard the 2.2 billion christians in the world referred to as the christian community , probably because we recognize there are so many subdivisions and subtleties and rivalries and groups that it 's silly to refer to them all as one community . 
  i wonder why we do n't extend islam the same benefit . 
  my neighbor growing up , actually . 
  i 'm not really talking about racism , per se . 
  it 's more that countries that are far away and have a weaker cultural connection to us do n't get us as excited when they 're the subject of almost daily terrorism . 
  and there 's probably a subconscious thought of `` well , of course it happens a lot there , that 's where the terrorists come from . '', 
  so to prevent hundreds or thousands of deaths , we go apeshit and kill millions ? 
  i 'm not sure i like this solution . 
  wtf is the `` muslim community '' i keep hearing about ? 
  france is like 9 % muslim . 
  nobody can claim to speak for all of them . 
  not really , the uprisings took the form of increased terrorism . 
  except in the uk you feel bad for the kebab stand owner :(, 
  these guys were french nationals .
