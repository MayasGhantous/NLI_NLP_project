  because christian kids are n't scary , see . 
   why we still have religion schools in 21st century . 
  the `` it is the present day and why is this still happening '' argument is getting pretty stale . 
  chronological advancement does not guarantee social advancement in any capacity . 
  a better question is `` why do we still have religious schools in countries that have adopted the separation of church and state ? '', 
  the original text , somehow predating the english language . 
  `` irish in \u00cele-de-france '' is the exact person qualified to make this comment . 
  military firing ranges , apparently . 
  i 'm sure if i were german i would also be curious and skeptical about french beer . 
  you 've got something going on there , but the londoners need to actively hate london 's government and keep pressing the cornish government to pass sanctions against it . 
  the uk 's new mexico , then . 
  i feel like to be uk 's florida you 'd need a lot more rich pensioners and a bunch of french immigrants who hate france . 
  `` if she was an ugly polish girl we would n't give a rat 's arse . '', 
  is cornwall , like , the alabama of uk ? 
  murica does n't do baby steps . 
  i 'm on mobile but imma guess you have a russia flair . 
  i think you misunderstand the term . 
  populism means exactly that - listening to what ordinary people want , instead of special interests . 
  it is n't a swear word . 
  i did n't realize how many european countries got there first . 
  thanks for the link . 
  i 'm fairly certain the us fully legalized same-sex marriage before most western european countries . 
  edit : `` fairly certain '' can apparently still be wrong . 
  the us gets a lot of flak for being a `` conservative country '' relative to liberal europe , but this is really only true when it comes to its economics . 
  the us tends to actually be ahead of the curve when it comes to many social issues . 
  europe has started electing populist anti-immigrant candidates a few years ago , actually . 
  trump is the us jumping on the bandwagon . 
  pretty soon you 'll elect your own donald trumps . 
  i expected a humorous post with a bunch of snow . 
  this is actually very pretty . 
  as an american : europe has an anthem ? 
  he 's trying to draw a comparison to gun laws and conclude that guns should n't require a background check . 
  for some people , that just reinforces the narrative of `` see ? 
  we ca n't coexist peacefully and they 'd be better off back in their shitty home countries ! '', 
  i have parisian cousins in their late 20s . 
  this feature is invaluable . 
  i never understood this accusation . 
  he 's a coward for committing his life for his ( indubitably psychopathic ) beliefs ? 
  these people are terrible people , but i do n't understand why `` coward '' is so commonly applied to them . 
  it 's not that norway 's economy is dependent on resources - that 's not my point . 
  it 's that norway 's * government revenue * is . 
  it 's not just taxes paying for the generous social programs . 
  sure , i 'm just explaining why americans do n't recognize the word `` kebab '' as referring to that particular food item . 
  i think you misunderstand me . 
  i 'm all for social policies in the style of belgium or denmark . 
  but a lot of people use norway as an example when norway relies at least partially on resources that other countries do n't have . 
  do n't forget : step 8 convince the world that your high taxes pay for social programs when in fact it 's 99 % your oil, 
  ** number of vikings players born in usa : ** 42 ** number of vikings players born in sweden : ** 0 quite disappointing , no ? 
  oil you say ? 
  here they 're sold as `` gyros '' in greek and middle eastern eateries , and there are tons of them around university campuses . 
  standards depend on circumstance . 
  elected officials who declare themselves to be a `` feminist government '' are declaring a high standard for themselves . 
  calling them out on not meeting it is fine because i never declared that standard for myself . 
  sounds like their version of reagan - a mythology used to legitimize modern bullshit . 
  yes , but i do n't go around seeking gunpoints . 
  they chose to go to iran . 
  i never ran for office claiming to be an activist . 
  it 's proper to hold them to higher standards than myself . 
  hint : if someone is only a feminist when it 's easy , they 're not a feminist . 
  i can see that . 
  in order to call a second independence referendum without seeming like they are not respecting the first one , they need to show that it 's the last resort for respecting the more recent eu referendum . 
  makes sense , both politically and socially . 
   hpshiw ? 
  in other words , the motion has no legal strength but can perhaps spark a scottish secession movement ? 
  is this merely a protest/advisory vote or can it actually start a process of scottish secession from the uk ? 
  looks like they forgot poland, 
  how 's switzerland doing nowadays ? 
  does it need some democracy ? 
  ooh , i thought those were in switzerland and france . 
  the borders are a bit confusing . 
  well played , italy !, 
  for a country made 95 % out of mountains , i expected italy to be doing better than this . 
  the use of the terrain to make siege weapons even more awkward to set up against a star fort is pretty awesome . 
  haha . 
  all right then , who is sauron ? 
  i never said he was !, 
  three rings for the nordic kings under the sky , seven for the slav-lords in their halls of stone , nine for eastern men doomed to dye , one for the duda lord on his duda throne , in the land of poland where the shadows lie . 
  jeez . 
  at least here in the us morons with fireworks only blow their own fingers off . 
  you ca n't dismiss millions of people . 
  we just learned that the hard way . 
  my experience with fox hating on jon stewart and their viewers eating it up tells me you are off the mark here . 
  the title is shite and the article is pointless , and they do n't deserve the pageview . 
  edit : i missed the joke , did n't i ? 
  `` britain 's ambassador to the eu , sir ivan rogers , has announced that a brexit deal could take 10 years . 
  that 's not fair . 
  most of the people who voted for it will be dead by then . '', 
  there , saved you from shitty clickbait . 
  probably because it 's wrong and also kind of silly . 
  of course you do !, 
  by the time you 're old , these technologies will be commonplace !, 
  yeah , what used to be `` chip '' is now `` chippy . '', 
  do n't get me wrong , i agree . 
  i was not being sarcastic . 
  it 's admittedly fairly similar to certain american english dialects in accent , but i believe the vocabulary is more standardized or something like that . 
  from the context , clearly not . 
  that 's why i asked . 
  that was , like , 90 % clear . 
  can you attempt international english , perchance ? 
  ok , and monstrosities like this are among the things they might sell ?
