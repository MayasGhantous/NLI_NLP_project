   they tasted way better when i was drunk . 
  if i had a nickle for every time i heard that ... 
  twenty quid says the sun will run a story about other sources ' outrage, 
  i 'm confused - at what point does he add whisky ? 
  what exactly does `` chip '' mean in this context ? 
  edit : changed to `` chippy '' in the parent comment . 
  can the mods edit his flair to say `` pizzaburger expert '' ? 
  of all the least necessary bots , this is the most least necessary, 
  that 's rich - a scot accusing somebody else of alcoholism . 
  / r/murica, 
  international english is actually a thing that is distinct from american english . 
  you messed up the link there a little bit . 
  also , the word `` variety '' is pretty broad ; i believe `` dialect '' is more appropriate here . 
  can you translate that to , uh , any other form of english ? 
  that 's basically what a dialect is, 
  the british have always been known for their class . 
  why is there no `` under 10 % '' category ? 
  well , no ; if you look at the other post ( trust in eu by country ) you 'll see that they tend to support it in higher numbers than oppose it . 
  but i guess this chart does agree they 're not huge fans of their own institutions . 
  so scandinavians love both the eu and their national parliaments ? 
  why are you so happy goddamit, 
  opposite opinions that should surprise nobody : * uk vs ireland * spain vs portugal * greece vs balkans, 
  technically , `` majority '' means `` largest group '' and `` absolute majority '' means `` 50 % +1 , '' so the terms are correct . 
  but i agree that your suggestion might be less likely to misguide . 
  can you describe how this change makes anything worse ? 
  no , you 're thinking of cellular components like mitochondria . 
  cells are literally what humans are made of . 
  `` not worthy of my attention ! '', 
   responds 5 times, 
  back to square 1 ... 
  it 's not very well-known and thus does n't communicate as effectively . 
  not everything is ~, 
  i 'm 80 % against being inclusive by incorporating too much , but 100 % in favor of being inclusive by keeping things simple . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ say ^ ^ `` queer , '' ^ ^ not ^ ^ `` lgbtroflbbq '', 
  yep , inclusive language is basically genocide . 
  the idea is that if you can make the experience better for 1/10000 of your customer base ( completely random fraction , but your percent is probably too small ) and no worse for the other 9999/10000 , you might as well do it . 
  nobody said it `` triggered '' anyone . 
  that was your word choice . 
  people felt somewhat uncomfortable about it , so metro decided to change it . 
  you do n't have to make it any bigger than that . 
  lol, 
  this is why i come here . 
  technology is progressive . 
  human interaction dynamics repeat all the time . 
  were they immigrants ? 
  i 'm asking honestly , because i 've seen no information leading me to believe they were . 
  but either way , no , that does n't make it terrorism . 
  what happened , despicable for sure , is a hate crime . 
  terrorism is more specific/nuanced than `` seek [ ing ] to terrorize '' . 
  it 's about attacking non-military targets in order to provoke a societal response that would undermine a government you ca n't otherwise defeat . 
  i think this guy was just a racist psychopath with no particular goal in mind beyond `` killing muslims . '', 
  not that i want to condone anything about this attack , but are we not starting to throw the word `` terrorism '' around a bit too loosely ? 
  he looks so much like a teddy bear i can never take the mountain seriously . 
  in some countries , every transfer of power is a revolution . 
  why is the thumbnail king kai 's planet though, 
  making this only about original members feels disingenuous and overly-tailored to fit a desired result . 
  the nobel peace prize is awarded ( partially ) based on effort and intent , not results . 
  it 's one of the reasons many people do n't take it very seriously . 
  eurozone = / = eu eurozone is the countries that use the euro, 
  absolutely . 
  if you look at the totality of american history , strict/loose constructionism and small/big government were never a consistent platform for any party . 
  they 're just used when convenient to push particular agendas . 
   let 's tie it to the number of representatives is not intuitive even to people who live with the system i disagree ; the number of representatives is tied to a state 's population , so it makes perfect sense . 
   and you also missed a big part of it . 
  while states get 3 plus votes , in the majority of cases the all go to the same candidate . 
  i missed nothing , i stated clearly that in almost every state all votes go to the same person . 
   it makes no sense no , it does n't . 
  but that 's not the same as being arbitrary , which it is n't . 
   the election part of the election is not really legally binding as i 've stated , this is technically true but in practice meaningless . 
  virtually no electors have gone against their state 's decision in a long , long time . 
   and no , the fact that they 've never done it is in no way an indicator that they never will since it 's more or less one of those things that can only happen once . 
  no sane person would build such a time bomb in to their system . 
  i have to disagree . 
  at this point the tradition is so enshrined that the country would not accept a president chosen by the electoral college if he/she was n't supposed to be elected as laid out by the states . 
  de facto , electors do not have free will to fuck everything up . 
  the vote they cast is more or less symbolic . 
   if the ec was forgotten and had to be reinvented from scratch , you could try for a million years and not get close to what exists today . 
  while i agree it 's a moronic system , i do n't think i agree with that last statement . 
  each state gets as many electors as its number of congressmen , which is pretty straightforward , as that number is 2 + ( 438/state population , at least 1 ) . 
  officially they 're allocated however the `` electors '' feel , but in all but 2 states every vote goes to the majority winner in that state . 
  consider my mind blown . 
  my bad brah, 
  pretty sure you did . 
  i think the most interesting bit is the bit about britain not having left yet . 
  the first domino has n't even finished falling . 
   we never really fit in or shared the values of the other countries could you elaborate on value differences ? 
  i 've actually seen some of them referring to him as a false flagger . 
   ca and texas basically set the education standards in the us . 
  more accurately , ca sets the education standards , and texas sets the standards for what shit you can get away with . 
  would n't you argue that the federal government 's refusal to enforce the fugitive slave act was part of the reason the south revolted ? 
  arguably , the south wanted the federal government to do * more * , or at least do its job . 
  this does n't sound like a states ' rights issue , it sounds like a policy issue reframed as states ' rights ( as is usually the case ) . 
  actually it was n't even that . 
  a major catalyst for the war was the federal government 's refusal to enforce the fugitive slave act upon the northern states . 
  that is correct , the south revolted because the federal government was n't forcing its will on the states enough . 
  do n't let historical revisionists tell you otherwise . 
  if this is true it would blow my mind . 
  this time , it was you who missed the joke . 
  ayyyup . 
  it 's supposed to be `` mudslimes , '' their clever pun , but poster could n't even spell that right .
