  fuck those people . 
   apparently if they 'd just let go of their steering wheels the autopilot would have sorted it all out . 
  that 's the case with a surprising number of plane crashes . 
  the plane would sort itself out if they 'd just leave it alone and let it but noooo they just have to keep fucking with the thing and they end up getting everyone killed . 
  no , people * calling * you racist is ok and those people should simply be ignored . 
  abundance of supply . 
  find something else to do in that case . 
  the market will work it out if you 'll let it . 
   there 's also a law against assembling ethnic and religious statistics without explicit consent from every individual included in the set of data . 
  that 's why media is limited to occasionally mentioning the backgrounds of people , or why the statements are so vague and speculative when they describe larger groups . 
  my god that 's some bullshit . 
   what i 've noticed about articles from the swedish press is they never actually tell us why these things are happening , or who 's actually doing it ... 
  it 's as if the concept of investigative journalism is just non-existent . 
  oh now they ca n't do * that * ... someone might be offended !, 
  thanks for letting us keep our secret ( well , not anymore ) torture houses there , by the way , that was really cool of y' all ... 
  ahhh , the weekly `` gosh we 're better than america ... are n't we ? 
  yes , yes , of course we are ! '', 
  self-reassuring circlejerk ... 
  double post, 
  that was just a whole bunch of nothing . 
  so yes . 
  you would think if anyone would get sarcasm , it would be a brit . 
  it 's the germanic peoples who i thought had trouble with that ... 
   this is fucking nuts !, 
  ** this . 
  knew this thread was just going to be another `` america sucks , am i right guys , or am i right ? 
  thread ... are you people really so fucking insecure ?!, 
  jesus , it seems like this is a weekly thing in this subreddit ... 
   it 's the banks ' fault !, 
  this is such a typical cop-out for this subreddit . 
  they may have * some * degree of culpability i suppose but they 're certainly not the main problem . 
  he got lucky , the bullet dodged * him * . 
  yes , that 's quite apparent from the article ( i actually read it before commenting - shocking , i know ) . 
  this is just nothing that a few people will turn into something because they see an excuse to get offended and screech `` sexism ! '' . 
  i 've no doubt somebody will call for the `` abolition of this sexist tradition '' that `` encourages the beating of women ! '', 
  while the other 98 % of us roll our eyes at them . 
  the source is the daily beast and * their * source is an unnamed `` u.s. intelligence officer '' . 
  come the fuck on . 
  y' all need to calm down . 
  so the specific failure in u.s. intel that allowed the boston bombing to happen was the same one cited above that allowed 9/11 to happen !, 
  because if not then that comparison is invalid and you 're an idiot . 
  which is why it 's on the front page of reuter 's ... no , wait , i 'm sure you know better than them , after all it is only a story about a poll indicating that one of the eu 's biggest members might actually vote to leave which is the opposite of what most people thought the consensus was up til now . 
  where ? 
  i was under the impression this is a new poll . 
  already pulled from / r/worldnews as apparently this is n't world news ... ? 
   it 's pretty fucked up that the us , the key instigator of this entire situation , has one of the lowest refugee acceptance rates . 
  no , it 's not , it 's simply `` not stupid '' , that 's what it is . 
  it may not be `` fair '' or `` humane '' , but i 'm * damned * glad our immigration policy is as strict as it is and that we turn down the overwhelming majority of people who europe would accept . 
  username nails it :d, 
  and ? 
  keep reaching for something to make your insecure self feel better . 
  the same reason stella is the most popular beer in europe . 
  do n't get me started on how europeans think american chocolate is basically just hershey 's , it 's like using budweiser as your basis for what `` american beer '' is like - yikes . 
  we make some damned good chocolate , my favorite is [ lake champlain ] ( http://www.lakechamplainchocolates.com/ ) from vermont . 
  i 'm not sure it is , if for no other reason than that 's a * super * broad comparison you 're making . 
  food from * where * in europe compared to * where * in the u.s. ? 
  let 's say it 's an accurate generalization . 
  if i had to guess i would say it 's because the european countries tend to subsidize the type of food you 're talking about ( fruit , vegetables , etc. ), 
  a lot more than we do . 
  it 's not that you ca n't get that quality of food in the u.s. , you can , it 's just that it costs * you * individually more because less of it is paid for by taxes . 
  edit : [ a more detailed explanation of the subsidy system i 'm talking about by someone who apparently knows more about it than me ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bbmjh/why_is_the_quality_of_food_in_europe_wheat_fruit/d17oll8 ) . 
  i 've heard * excellent * things about quebecois chicks . 
  i 've always been partial to `` the canucks '' . 
  you 're the `` cute '' one , 
  in your opinion . 
  it 's a combination of funny and aggravating how willfully blind you are to what 's being pointed out to you . 
  gee i wonder why . 
   all you 're doing there is using the word ` culture ' instead of ` skin colour ' . 
  yes and that makes all the difference , it 's the difference between racism and not racism . 
   it 's the same prejudice . 
  no , it 's only racist if the discrimination in question is based on race , that is they 're discriminated against * because * of race . 
   by this logic , as british culture is drinking and being racist abroad , we must assume brits just ca n't help themselves , it 's inbuilt . 
  no , that 's not a correct comparison . 
  you 're being racist there and that 's * not * what he was talking about , that 's discrimination based on someone 's race/genetics , which is specifically what he was saying is * not * ok and is racism . 
  he never said or implied that their culture was due to their race/genetics , which is what you 're implying there . 
  do n't put words in people 's mouths . 
  the funny thing is that actually tells you something about what they look like : male , dark skinned , foreign . 
  because if they were anything else , there would be a description . 
  multiculturalism yay . 
  you should n't be downvoted for a question ... 
  that 's not a good reason not to tell the truth . 
  almost nothing ever is ... 
  is that leonardo dicaprio ? 
  that looks like him . 
  my money would be simple ignorance of the law due to the fact that they probably do n't have to take the german driving exam there and can just drive on their american license . 
  the number you want to look at is violations per vehicle . 
  i was surprised to see us ( the u.s. ) in the top 10 list until i looked at that and figured out that it was because we had so * many * people ( all driving different vehicles ) that we had so many violations . 
  americans were n't very likely to get a ticket , it 's just that there 's a lot of them . 
  looking like they probably had a good point ... 
  he 's speaking about a nationality , that 's not racism . 
  i do n't doubt the eu has many standards and figures and such defining precisely what it is , my point is that it 's the eu that defines it as opposed to the market . 
  irrelevant . 
  which has nothing to do with what he said . 
   it 's all thanks to the eu and their regulations !, 
   without leading to poor performance . '', 
  and who gets to define what `` poor performance '' is ? 
   if they had said `` without leading to a reduction [ as in `` any '' ] in performance '' then i would n't have a problem with it , but they do n't . 
  they can define `` poor performance '' however they like and i guarantee you what they say is n't `` poor performance '' a lot of other people * will * . 
  * that 's * the problem and the problem so many people have with the eu : this sort of petty , silly , irritating meddling in people 's lives that 's entirely unwarranted and really just the result of a bureaucracy trying to justify its own existence and budget . 
  i ca n't believe people are getting their panties in a twist over this , he was making a joke and it was an at least somewhat funny one .
