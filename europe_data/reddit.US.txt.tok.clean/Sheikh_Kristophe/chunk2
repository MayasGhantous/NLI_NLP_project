  i also was n't implying that the serbs hate more ... 
  you think that if the society within which he was working was liberal/tolerant about such things , the gays would be so oppressed . 
  ramzan is a product of homophobia , not the cause . 
  his assassination would do nothing for the homosexuals . 
  ( except vengeance , which is sweet sometimes ) . 
  curious why the numbers for the netherlands is higher than for poland ? 
  and that 's the reason when i rented a car in croatia , they told me not to use the car with croatian plates in serbia . 
  they said drop it off in croatia , then rent a car in serbia for serbia . 
  i wish i could see these results split up by age group , though . 
  i think that would be an interesting way to look at whether it 's just nostalgia , current situation , or actual political ideologies at work . 
  these numbers do n't tell us anything about productivity . 
  * d\u00ear * for * church * in the kurdish areas is maybe from arabic * dayr * * monastery * . 
  yeah , the `` it 'll cost me dearly '' idiom pattern only makes sense when you know the etymology . 
  funny enough , i searched and found a 20th century use from america where the `` expensive '' meaning is used :  1902 , briquettes as fuel in foreign countries ( report of the united states bureau of foreign commerce ) :  ** this water is sold for 50 cents per ton , which is not dear under the circumstances . 
  okay , more ignorant shit . 
  you would n't dare say that about haitian kr\u00e9yol or mandarin chinese . 
  it 's okay , because it 's directed at the anglosphere . 
  while nobody is taking offense , you are still wrong as fuck and have shown your ignorance to the world . 
  really ? 
  do you mind writing some actual examples to satisfy my curiosity ? 
  there are plenty of multilinguals who are overly excited about their own . 
  i get what you 're sayig though, 
  i hope that you forgot to write / s. . . or else you deserve an honorary subscription to / r/badlinguistics, 
  it was an ignorant statement , but why do you assume he or she is monolingual ? 
  i think turks also had a nationalist scholar who proposed when turkey was coming to nationhood that turkish was the origin of all languages . 
  that does n't help . 
  yes , you can be skinny on mcd ... 
  but you will lack so many nutrients and get diabetes . 
  on the other hand , i like eating meals that are 70 % veggies so i never have to worry about portion control . 
  yeah , but only in ny . 
  there are n't a lot of turks outside of the big metropolitan immigrant magnets ( ny , chicago , miami , sf , etc. ), 
  we do have a lot of arabs where i 'm from and roughly d\u00fcr\u00fcm = shawarmeh and d\u00f6ner = kebab . 
  yeah , but that just means the ounger generations of the u.s. are more obese than the younger generations of elsewhere . 
  it does n't mean that older generations are n't more obese . 
  you 're correct . 
  it does n't get used for expensive anymore except in archaisms . 
  cari\u00f1o is widely used in the americas . 
  the semantic expensive-dear relationship exists outside of indo-european languages as well . 
  for example , arabic has \u063a\u0627\u0644\u064d ( \u063a\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629 in the feminine ) [ pronounced `` gh\u00e2lin / gh\u00e2liyah '' / \u02c8\u0264a\u02d0l\u026an ( or ) \u02c8\u0264a\u02d0lij\u00e6h / ] which means both expensive and dear . 
  also edit , i forgot to mention that * cher/caro * (  latin * carvs * ) and * teuer/dear/duur / d\u00fdr / dyr * (  proto-germanic * diurijaz * ) do n't have the same ancestor in proto-indo-european . 
  it was a play on words , so the translation `` expensive '' is n't really incorrect . 
  well , shit , / r/woooosh, 
  i got a sandwich there exactly 2 months ago . 
  russia 's not consistently included or left out of european statistics ... 
  it really depends on the definition of europe used by the researchers/compilers/journalists . 
  plus ayran , garlic sauce , and a cigarette ( if you go all in like i do ) , and you have got yourself a pretty nasty concoction !, 
  i 'm so surprised , assuming these data are correct , that spain has a higher approval rating than france , germany , switzerland , ireland , norway , luxembourg , and belgium . 
  i figured they 'd be more in the italy , portugal , slovenia , czech republic range . 
  the top 7 are ** usa ** , mexico , ** new zealand ** , hungary , ** australia ** , ** uk ** , ** canada ** . 
  the ones in bold are anglophone . 
  that 's 5 . 
  yeah , but the word is germanic . 
  hindu-arabic , straight-up arabic numerals are slightly different ( even though the terminology is fucked ) ... 
  the word * ninety * is germanic , we 're not saying * tis3een * so the number is n't arabic . 
  i hate when people do n't get the difference . 
  i had a german tutor that told me every time we got a cognate that it came from the german word . 
  i told him every time that germanic is different than german , ( and the two words do n't even sound the same in german , so i 'm assuming he picked up this faulty idea while learning english ) but to no avail . 
  if all d\u00f6ner shops in germany closed , it would go down to 11.8 ... just a guess . 
  _ insert pseudoscientific sapir-whorf-hypothesis-based explanation here _, 
  remember it 's not as common in metropolitan area . 
  are you from a village or a city ? 
  france has quite a bit of overweight , but as an american , i definitely see more straight-up obese people back in the states than i do in france -- even in the villages ( parisians are a pretty fit bunch ) . 
  you have to look at it by generation . 
  things are getting better for the younger generations . 
  the real `` bulk '' is the older generations raised on relative scarcity poorly adjusting to the boon of capitalist surplus . 
  do n't learn english . 
  it 's the common denominator of 5 of the top 7 most obese countries . 
  that is a really pleasing graphic . 
  i wish it were larger and had even more policy stances !, 
  there is such a thing as a black-market tax , though , just the recipient is n't the government . 
  one pays a premium for illegal goods . 
  i 'm surprised france did so well . 
  most of the french people i know above the age of 28 prefer wine or liquor to beer . 
  not to say they do n't drink it , but coming up right behind the brits is impressive ... 
  yeah , english has a ton of words , too . 
  honestly , the large majority of these words are obscure/archaic/poetic and therefore hardly recognized and almost never used . 
  these `` inuit peoples have ______ words for snow , '' `` arabs have _________ words for sand , '' `` germans have __________ words for economy , '' and `` americans have ______ words for climate change denial '' claims are all pop-sciency and * wrong . 
  * in fact , posts of such a nature are so common that / r/badlinguistics is full of x-posts to such claims . 
  bleep blorp . 
  not a bot . 
  etymologybot says : in ** bl\u00f6tsn\u00f6 ** , the * bl\u00f6t * just means `` wet , '' so it 's like saying *** wet-snow . 
  *** ( unfortunately , it 's not related to the english word `` blot '' which can be used to mean `` soaking up/absorbing a liquid '' ) in ** kramsn\u00f6 ** , the * kram * comes from the verb * krama * ( from old norse , which is probably where english got it too , to be honest ) , which is related to the english word * cram * ( squeeze , pack , etc. ), 
  and means the same thing . 
  ( and also to hug ) . 
  so this literally means *** cram-snow *** . 
  and obviously , ** pudersn\u00f6 ** just means *** powder-snow . 
  *** interestingly ( not ) , though these two germanic languages share this word , it is actually a latin word `` pulvis '' ( meaning * dust * ) , transformed by old french phonetic changes into either * poudre * , * poldre * , * puldre * , or whatever depending on the area/time/orthographical prowess of the writer . 
  it 's the internet , arguments are mandatory , even between two parties which agree . 
  i know , i am saying i like the word given those conditions . 
  czechia to me sounds like a good abbreviation of czech republic . 
  i would never say , `` i went to czech last year '' , but i also do n't want to have to be stuck saying the full thing , so i think they should exist side-by-side . 
  i 'm sure i 'll be able to find the blog you 're referring to . 
   what matters is the association most people have . 
  yeah , this makes no sense . 
  the burden would be on you to show that people do , in fact , have imply negative association between a woman in power and a mother . 
  so literally both a man and a woman in leadership are referred to popularly by a parental title , but because you think it 's sexist , it 's sexist ? 
  come on !, 
  french ( language ) : - lacrim , gradur , nekfeu , sadek , stromae , ma\u00eetre gims , jacques brels , serge gainsbourg . 
  if you could somehow keep one ethnicity from having all the power , it could theoretically work . 
  the biggest issue is croats and bosnians not wanting to be subordinate to serbs ( understandably ) .
