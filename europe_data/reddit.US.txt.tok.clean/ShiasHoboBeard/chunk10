  it should overtake us just by virtue of its size , but their society is pretty fucked up . 
  their economy is not as strong as people think . 
  man , it 's always weird to read asian as an american and have to translate that in my head from japanese/chinese/korean to pakistani/bangladeshi/indian . 
  at first i catch myself wondering how you have a japanese problem . 
  when you post job ads where you specifically exclude people based on their race , you 're probably not a centrist . 
  does the uk keep crime stats that distinguish by race or ethnicity ? 
  i was going to say it 's probably correct because the uk is something like 80-90 % white still , but then again , i was shocked by the disparity in our own country , so anything is possible i guess . 
  yeah harder than america for sure . 
  i 'm really shocked bbc would post this . 
   `` but the vast majority of child sex abuse carried out in this country is carried out by white men - through the home , through family networks and through the internet . '', 
  oh ok , that makes sense . 
  i 'm not saying poland has done anything to effect immigration . 
  they have n't had the problem because they are not an attractive destination for migrants . 
  that does n't mean that western europe is helpless or that poland would have the exact same issues if it were wealthy . 
  we do n't know because there has n't been an opportunity to see , but theoretically there is no reason they could n't strictly enforce borders as we are doing in america . 
  why not ? 
  it 's easy to stop if you have the will . 
  the mere threat of trump 's enforcement has managed to drop illegal immigration numbers by 70 % here . 
  no wall , and no measures other than beefing up the numbers of immigration enforcement officers and allowing them to do their jobs . 
  it is just common sense if you think about it . 
  the migrants are coming for the benefits , because they think they can earn more in europe than in africa . 
  they pay smugglers thousands ( or take out loans ) for the trip to europe , and expect to make a return on their investment . 
  if you deny them and ship them back , wasting their investment , then they will realize there is no golden ticket as they thought and they will not come , or at the very least they will not have the means to take the trip . 
  as long as many or most are successful , the dream of europe will stay alive for africans in the same way that the american dream lives on for south americans . 
  i do n't understand what you mean by that . 
  european americans do n't consider themselves european , that 's how assimilated they are . 
  i 'm not worried about europe other than poland , as i still have family there . 
  but having less wealth means you attract fewer of these migrants . 
  so the problem is the migrants , not the wealth , given that western countries became wealthy without them . 
  what does income have to do with it ? 
  we have cities that are happy to harbor foreign citizens who are here illegally , and hispanic lawmakers that are encouraging it . 
  i do n't have to link you to the reports of ms-13 or all the crimes being committed . 
  hispanics are a special case because you have a lot of variance between subgroups like cubans , who seem to integrate fairly well , vs mexican/south american illegals , who do n't . 
  ( people who disrespect immigration law might be inclined to disrespect other laws , what a shock ) i do n't need to describe how spanish is practically required to get a job in certain areas of the country . 
  the amount of abuse in our welfare systems is just unfreaking believable . 
  i 've worked with a lawyer who specialized in defending hispanics because he could speak spanish himself , and the kinds of cases he had were incredible . 
  often , these people would walk in with five children and no clear means to support them , and did not speak english ** at all ** . 
  i also live on the east coast , not west , and really could n't believe how bad the problem was all the way over here . 
  if you are n't aware of the issues then you must not live anywhere near hispanics or lack exposure to the systems in which they occur . 
  almost ** 1 in 4 ** american muslims say that there is a ` great deal ' or ` fair amount ' of support for extremism among muslims in the us , and 15 % of muslims under 30 believe that suicide bombing can be ` sometimes justified ' . 
  ( which implies second generation muslims or more recent arrivals ) and that is without considering that muslims are still just 1 % of our population . 
  so overall , i 'm sure they look just fine because we really do n't have that many to begin with , but go examine muslim hotspots in the country and see how well they are doing . 
  our system of immigration is a total mess , and it 's no surprise when we have lax enforcement combined with a lottery system that does n't prioritize qualities that would encourage integration , and retarded chain migration rules . 
  even canada and australia are having problems , and they have much better immigration systems than we do . 
  i do n't think they do that at all . 
  look at this article . 
  there is no name reported . 
  you have the details of the event , eye witness account , statement from relevant authorities , and ... that 's it . 
  are you saying that they need to go further and actually tell people not to worry about this incident ? 
  they already view the west as a common enemy ... they are n't going to be finally convinced of that by kaczy\u0144ski or orban . 
  it does n't work for us . 
  it does n't work anywhere . 
   your entire comment is an ** `` armchair expertise '' ** ; reality `` on the field '' is different , and not as grim as you seems to believe . 
   ** ( look at black people in the us ... ) **, 
  why do n't you have better crime statistics ? 
  you mean by reporting on them ? 
  you could argue that believing in certain ideologies is a sign you are mentally unhealthy , but i agree , schizophrenia does n't make you violent . 
  then we should n't do that . 
  what if more money does the same ? 
  a firm stance can do wonders . 
  70 % less illegal immigration is not bad for a start . 
  what if throwing money at the problem does n't work ? 
  so what should be done with her then ? 
  what would be a just consequence for her actions ? 
  additionally , say that you are wrong and that there is no chance for rehabilitation in this particular case , and she goes on to indoctrinate or murder others . 
  would that just be an acceptable risk for you in order to maintain these principles ? 
   besides , we do n't treat teenagers as adults before the law . 
  we do n't let them drive , or marry , or vote . 
  how can we think that they 're too immature to do these things , but mature enough to be sentenced to death ? 
  i do n't understand this point of view . 
  we do n't give teenagers the same responsibility as adults , therefore , joining a terrorist organization that prides itself on murdering innocents does n't warrant the death sentence ? 
  do you believe that her undeveloped brain hindered her ability to understand what she was getting involved in ? 
  i mean that 's the rational for why we do n't allow teens to marry . 
  can your 5 year-old niece travel to syria and help murder innocent people ? 
  what if she feels emboldened by the leniency and begins recruiting others within germany ? 
  she is very young . 
  if she were allowed back , imagine how many converts she could create over her lifetime . 
  i think that is even more dangerous than any physical harm she could inflict on her own . 
  why ? 
  do you think there is a chance for rehabilitation ? 
  [ `` she was only a child when she was propagandized '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6s5ysf/cheering_iraqis_march_arrested_german_isis_teen/dlah6sr/ ) [ `` she 's just a child , even looks like me '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6s5ysf/cheering_iraqis_march_arrested_german_isis_teen/dlant9m/ ) that is sympathy they are expressing , fyi . 
  seems like she was just as bloodthirsty as anyone there until her side lost . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  while the spanish are 100 % european , we are dealing with mestizos . 
  i see your comments all the time . 
  you are the definition of a self-hating lefty . 
  so the will of the people does n't matter ? 
  they should be bound by the last minute decision of an outgoing government that clearly was n't representing them ? 
  seriously ? 
  you are blaming romania 's corruption problems on poland and hungary ? 
   the united states has had significant non-white population since it 's very founding . 
  their figures also include ` hispanics ' . 
  here in europe we do n't really see hispanics as separate from white people . 
  no it has n't , and that 's because your hispanics are white people . 
  your comment is completely clueless . 
  america started as basically an ethno-state for white protestant christians . 
  blacks are only around 13 % of our population , and no , it was really only after 1965 that we began to shift from being predominantly white . 
  wow you really believe that ? 
  if anything , the radicalism has been ramping up . 
  we have not yet seen the west respond to the new circumstances .
