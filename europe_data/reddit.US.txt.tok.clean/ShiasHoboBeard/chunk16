  trying to get it to join western institutions that are opposed to russia is just going to provoke an aggressive response , like what was done to crimea . 
  only for the plebs . 
  they prefer all-white gated communities for themselves . 
  [ atlanta is # 18 ] ( https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/atlanta-named-one-america-top-murder-capitals/iazy5csktgxxs436en8chl/ ) in the top 25 murder capitals of america . 
  it was not in any way anti-religious . 
  the move was to distance religion from the state and to embrace debate and questioning of doctrine . 
  many of the people involved were themselves religious . 
  ( contd . ), 
   have you actually read , or have any passing familiarity with it ? 
  not to mention that the cost currently pledged is 1/100th of the cost of the proposed `` wall '' between the us and mexico . 
  yes , actually , i have read it . 
  i 've also read the `` contributions '' that china and india have promised , and i see exactly why we had no trouble signing them up to the agreement ... and wow , are you sure you read the agreement ? 
  the cost described included guarantees that it would increase in the future , and specifically that there would be review periods to see if things needed to be changed . 
  those were always going to be to our detriment , so i 'm glad we 're not involved . 
   even now , the current progress from renewable is something that is being sabotaged by trump in his pursuit of `` clean coal '' . 
  how is it being sabotaged in any way ? 
  it seems that you do n't understand trump 's perspective on energy . 
  he is not against renewables , he just does not want to punish coal . 
  he wants us to use whatever energy source is most cost effective and efficient for our needs . 
  one day that will flip over entirely to renewables , but that day is not today . 
  again , he is not advocating for subsidies for coal . 
  he is in favor of removing penalties and letting the market decide the speed of the transition . 
   also because they 've been embroiled in fraud scandals , and even with all of that they should never have borrowed money from foreign powers . 
  if the gravity of that is not enough , that it might be pointless to discuss collusion because our views of it are completely different . 
  yeah clearly . 
  i mean if you think borrowing money from foreign banks is collusion , then i can see we think entirely differently on what that word means . 
   i would have accepted that the us supported a candidate from les r\u00e9publicains , viewing the shift from left to right , but the fn is unacceptable . 
  all the parties , right , left and center , except the communists this time normally form a bloc against them for a good reason . 
  i do n't know if i can convey to you who they are or if you care . 
  you are really overestimating how much americans were involved in that election . 
  people in / r/the _ donald liked her stance on immigration and did n't really care that much about her other positions . 
  we do n't know all the history of the parties or anything like that , so we do n't have the same aversion to le pen that you do . 
  like i said before though , i could care less who france elects because i respect the right of people to forge their own path . 
   i get tired on having to repeat this over and over , but the 2 % agreement arbitrary as it was , was agreed upon , but it was simply not fast enough for trump . 
  right , now nothing has actually changed , apart from calls for more co-operation between eu nations . 
  has the u.s media decided to yell `` mission accomplished '' than ? 
  completely [ false ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/05/02/nato-weighs-new-counterterrorism-post-following-trumps-demands.html ) . 
  there was a new counter-terrorism post established a while back after he criticized them . 
  and since his criticisms , [ $ 10 billion has been contributed ] ( http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nato-chief-allied-spending-up-10-billion-because-of-trump/article/2620151 ) according to the nato secretary-general . 
  that does n't mean things are perfect , but it shows him that progress can be made and the alliance can be reformed into something more palatable . 
   apart from his attempt to make germany pay more protection , in a face to face meeting , which was unrelated to the subject . 
  something which was shockingly amateurish , a move he may or may now have recused . 
  i loved it . 
  it was almost as good as when he embarrassed eu leaders by reminding them of their obligations during his nato speech . 
  i want more of that . 
   i would also like to point that in between the time of his reversal from wanting to quit nato , he also got embroiled in the syrian war , so no one is fooled by the reason for his turn-around . 
  he affirmed article 5 , after a round of refusing to affirm it and questioning it 's use and legitimacy , or did you forget ? 
  that 's what i 've been telling you this whole time . 
  he questioned the alliance , and then he affirmed article 5 later . 
  this is what you call `` moving the goalpost '' . 
  so before , the criticism was that he was noncommittal on nato , now it 's that he has n't committed quickly enough for your taste . 
  by the way , we 've been embroiled in syria for a long time and it was obama 's administration who brought us there , so i have no idea how that would have impacted his decision at all . 
   hmm , and yet his policies have endangered american influence and trade deals , and prefers that the u.s takes a hit in a trade war with the eu and china `` as long as the [ opposite party ] lose more '' . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  personally , i think he has reasserted american sovereignty where it was lacking before , and reminded partners that we have our own interests also . 
   a look beyond the populist rhetoric to the hard numbers shows that often times his claims are often erroneous , such as his misunderstanding on the fundamentals of the eu . 
  i ca n't speak for mexico , but they seem to have gotten closer to china to counter the threat , and trudeau stressed the importance of trade deals after a round of the u.s threatening them over milk , wood or whatever was the perfect scapegoat . 
  we 're going in circles , but your vision of a us that focuses on itself , and seeks more peace , does n't really align with what i 've observed with trump 's behavior , or his bellicose language . 
  so now , my question would be less what you think he wants , rather with what his administration wants , if they have a plan . 
  do you mean him trying to trade with individual eu members ? 
  that 's not a misunderstanding lol . 
  we want bilateral trade between nations , and he made that clear . 
  mexico ca n't ` counter the threat ' by getting close to china because they rely on us for 95 % of their trade , and trump is aware of this . 
  as far as what trump wants , i guess we 'll see what he tries to get and how successful he is . 
  i am optimistic though . 
   huh , and yet trump has n't disdained the support of corporations of the saudis and corporations , quite the opposite in fact . 
  so do forgive me if i remain skeptical that any side of the american spectrum is clean of that . 
  trump has had alot more success making his brand accepted overseas , has n't he ? 
  what money has he received ? 
  none . 
  he does n't take a presidential salary . 
  his businesses have actually taken a hit because lots of brands no longer want to do business with him or his daughter ivanka . 
  there is no way you could look at him and think he is doing this for the money . 
  he would have made more doing another season of the apprentice if that 's what motivated him . 
  ( he turned that down in order to run )  you mean the title you 're referring to ? 
  his son going with his knowledge ( self-admitted ) to get information from a russian lawyer who is heavily affiliated with the russian government . 
  so , how is that nothing ? 
  or is your only argument `` the media told me to say that it 's nothing '' . 
  also , you 've only repeated verbatim `` it 's not big deal '' . 
  he posted his e-mail communication . 
  he had one meeting with a russian lawyer who promised dirt on clinton and walked away with nothing . 
  where is the collusion ? 
  how is she ` heavily affiliated with the russian government ' ? 
  does she represent the russian government ? 
  you are low on details here and it is painfully obvious . 
  what did he gain exactly ? 
  you are just repeating ` collusion ' without specifying what he has done that is illegal . 
  you know it 's not legal to conspire with a foreign government to affect the outcome of the election , right ? 
  if what you are saying is just so obvious and clear and he even admitted to doing it , then where is the prosecution ? 
  trump does n't control the whole government . 
  he would n't be able to stop it if there was an actual case to be made against him . 
   ahem https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/world/asia/trump-russia-sanctions.html amongst others , but this is a english source . 
  it 's not the independant , or other tabloid news either , so at this point you 'll have to directly say the media is lying , which would signify the complete break between trump 's supporters and newspapers themselves . 
  at that point it just returns to the accusations of a personality cult . 
  oh please . 
  can you at least consider the context of what you are reading rather than stop at the word sanctions ? 
  let 's take the first sentence of the article . 
   the white house is quietly lobbying house republicans to weaken a bill overwhelmingly passed by the senate last week that ** would slap tough new sanctions ** on russia for its meddling in the 2016 election and allow congress to block any future move by president trump to lift any penalties against moscow . 
  trump is not opposing sanctions on russia . 
  he is opposing ** additional new sanctions ** on russia for the obvious reason that it 's going to make any negotiation with him impossible .
