  rex tillerson made this clear during his confirmation hearings when he stated that he would seek to maintain the status quo , meaning not to touch existing sanctions but also not to go further , in the hopes that a dialogue could be established and we could move forward with russia . 
  now let 's backtrack to what you said : `` attempts to lift sanctions '' . 
  is that what your article says ? 
  is he attempting to lift sanctions there ? 
  no , no he is not . 
   that is honestly a new accusation , and i do n't believe it one bit . 
  one of the first moves and sources of criticism for his administration was that he preferred putting in yes-men over competent members . 
  perry , the new epa and education amongst others that are infamous , flynn and who else . 
  particular note should be taken of the `` diplomat '' who they had to change because they were stupid enough to compare the eu to the ussr . 
  you think trump 's cabinet is the whole us government ? 
  there are literally thousands of people that work under those men that have not changed . 
  many people , especially in key places like the state department , have not been fired and replaced . 
  democrats are also stalling his appointments , so he ca n't get his people into the government even though he wants to . 
   as for the fbi director ? 
  from outside the u.s , it does look pretty tyrannical to fire the man who 's supposed to be investigating you , and trump did outright lie on his initial reasons for it , only admitting it to some russian ambassadors . 
  how did firing the fbi director impede the investigation in any way ? 
  btw , it 's not an investigation of trump at all . 
  it 's an investigation of russian interference in the 2016 elections , and any possible connections between his campaign staff at the time and the russian government . 
  there is not one iota of evidence connecting trump to russia , and the fbi director repeatedly stated that trump himself was not under investigation . 
  so where did you get the idea that the fbi director was supposed to be doing that from ? 
   on all other matters , i would defer to you in the respect , but this ? 
  this is just full of shit from trump `` climate change is a chinese hoax '' amongst others . 
  trump who his administration is suppressing data and information like a worse case of harper . 
  that tweet was a joke , conveying how little the chinese care about the environment compared to us , and how much they would benefit from any carbon tax we imposed on ourselves . 
  you can watch a clip on youtube where he explains it , or just google ` trump joke china climate change ' . 
  he did n't literally mean that the chinese invented it ... but i could understand why you think that , because the media continues to say that he is some emotional , out of control idiot and if you believe that , then you are going to think he is serious . 
  what data suppression ? 
  what actually occurred ? 
   trump 's exit from the paris accords , one of the only ones in the world , was denied because this was a move to reduce warming to under 2 degreess celsius on a global scale , and incorporated most nations in the world . 
  do you realize the scale , time and resources necessary for such a negotiation based on the rhetoric of a populist ? 
  it was non-binding !, 
  trump could have remained and refused to pay a cent , but he had to pander to his base . 
  that 's literally a contradiction . 
  so it was non-binding and he could do whatever he wanted , but they are trying to deny him from exiting or renegotiating it ? 
   i would not put faith in their complete altruism in this manner , but his claim that it would only transfer polluting jobs was completely false . 
  the non-binding aid was based on helping for the construction of infrastructure specifically so developing countries would n't go through the same polluting industrial revolution that developed countries have gone through . 
  china would have to do literally zero . 
  that 's why they agreed to it . 
  turkey admitted recently that they only signed on for the wealth transfer , and since that 's not happening anymore , they do n't think the agreement will be ratified . 
  let me ask you a question . 
  if it is so critical that we stop emissions in absolute terms , meaning that we need to avoid hitting a particular number in order to save ourselves , then why the hell would we allow china or india to pollute while europe and the us have restrictions ? 
  in order to ` be fair and let them develop ' ? 
  we will apparently risk our existence on this planet just to be sure china and india get the same opportunity as us . 
  that 's how i know this agreement is 100 % feel-good bullshit . 
   in london , i 'll give you that it feels close but it 's still quite above 50 % , clear majority , so i do n't know why you write \\ minority / british , seems a bit disingenuous which reduces your point to me . 
  read my comment again . 
  i said ` within my lifetime , that city ** will have gone ** ' . 
  my life is n't over yet , and judging by how quickly it has changed , it 's extremely likely it will happen within the next 50-60 years . 
  would n't you agree ? 
   uk wide the total foreign born , with no break down was at 13,3 % in 2015 ... does that seem even close to challenging the majority to you ? 
  people generally only consider the birth rate and death rate between natives and immigrants when thinking about population replacement , but we also need to look at immigration and , more importantly , what could change politically . 
  the change that you believe will happen gradually could happen quite dramatically if muslims become enough of a minority to begin to sway elections . 
  if they change the rules for family reunification , refugee quotas , etc , you could see a very quick change occur . 
  the point is that there will be no way to stop it once you realize what is happening . 
  say that muslims only take over london in the beginning , well now that becomes somewhat of an outpost for that ( countrywide ) minority that you can do nothing about . 
  we in america are much further along the process than you and we are having major problems that you have yet to encounter . 
  as people from south of the border have migrated here and begun having families , they have failed to integrate , which has led now to politicians from those communities backing legislation that would eliminate our borders . 
  they want to legalize those in their community that have crossed illegally , and change the laws to be more favorable to people coming in . 
  recently in california , we had a situation where an illegal migrant sued in court and won over $ 100k . 
  what for ? 
  well because local police attempted to contact federal authorities concerning his immigration status . 
  try to wrap your mind around that . 
  the local police wanted to enforce the law concerning immigration in our country , and courts in california ruled that they had done something wrong to , not even a non-citizen , but a citizen here in violation of the law and owed that person compensation for his trouble . 
  there are entire cities now that refuse to enforce our immigration law , and going forward we will have a tough time staying together as one nation . 
  eventually , i predict we will end up balkanizing into several different countries due to our differences . 
  in many of these states , illegal migrants actually get priority ** over ** natives for welfare and education grants . 
  berkley actually [ advertises a program specifically for illegals ] ( https://undocu.berkeley.edu/ ) , and even offers legal assistance to them . 
  the very rule of law is being undermined here , but again , you think it 's fine because you 're not where we are yet . 
  one day , you will be . 
   but fall short supporting the ethnic point that i think you 're trying to make . 
  most of the poor people are of those background that you argue are taking over and get none of those profits and growth , how does that work out , seems to me the majority of people ( incl . 
  whites ) are getting fucked over by the economy . 
  how so ? 
  oh , do you think i meant that those nasty immigrants are coming and they 're going to take mer jerbs ? 
  no , that 's not at all what i mean or what i fear . 
  i 'm worried about cultural change and the unrest that comes with putting very different people in close proximity to each other . 
  i 'm concerned about being forced by the government to subsidize people that should n't even be here legally . 
  the very same stresses that are coming soon to the uk . 
   i know about sa history and the harsh backlash but i think it 's a bit weird to compare white euros being replaced in their native land with the south africa state considering their clear non native-ness history there , not a strong example . 
  that 's not the point i was trying to make by referencing sa . 
  i 'm using it as an example to illustrate that happens to a white minority who willingly gives control over to a black majority . 
  was there a care and concern over minority rights after that happened ? 
  so we have some insight into what the future could look like if white europeans ever become outnumbered in their own countries . 
  we have developed a tradition here of protecting the rights of the defenseless , but will that carry forward when the majority of people are descended from third world nations where such concepts have not taken root ? 
  i doubt it . 
   the same way that you said the mainstream media supported clinton . 
  it 's in the context that murdoch and his fellows have been supporting trump for a while now . 
  i notice that you neglected to mention any financial support . 
  hillary 's backing by saudi arabia , big banks , and corporations was clear . 
  you have to twist your words and consider positive media coverage to be equivalent to say the same of trump . 
   you do n't think there 's now not only an ideological split , but also information split on what information media is now published , especially on trump ? 
  not sure what you mean , precisely . 
  yeah there are differences between the media . 
  some will fabricate outright lies while others will just have a laser-like focus on the negatives . 
   continuing on my point , have you noticed that you 're doing the same thing now , except with russia ? 
  you insisted it was `` nothing '' and yet as the debacle has progressed from when this chain has started , trump has gone to accepting that he knew about what junior did , to outright saying collusion is `` no big deal '' . 
  haha , are you serious ? 
  i know the exact article headline you are talking about . 
  how is that not an example of you simply repeating whatever lies the media feeds you ? 
  do n't just repeat it .
