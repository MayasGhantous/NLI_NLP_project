  conflict between the values , and the law in force , creates a feeling of injustice . 
  the supreme court in its rulings should take that dualism into account . 
  that does n't sound so scary . 
  they 're just stating the obvious and suggesting that the laws should take into account the values of the people and try to avoid creating great conflict between them . 
  it does n't read like a requirement but more like a suggestion . 
  there are no values spelled out that people must conform to , or punishment if they do not . 
  once again , language colors the issue . 
  you should always be wary when an article is full of emotionally charged rhetoric but lacking in details . 
  this one is extremely manipulative . 
   on wednesday , the polish parliament passed an amendment to a new law on the national council of judiciary -- a constitutional body tasked with appointing and promoting judges . 
  it was an outrageous move , giving the pis majority the unconstrained power to elect 22 out of 25 members of the council . 
  so this is an ** outrageous ** move that gives them ** unconstrained ** power . 
  what is it doing exactly ? 
   judges in poland are selected through a process whereby the national judiciary council ( krs ) , consisting mostly of senior lawyers chosen by professional associations , propose judges who are later sworn in by the president . 
  under the new rules , parliament will nominate krs members , giving the ruling party full indirect control over the appointment of judges . 
  ok , so the difference is that instead of having judges chosen by a cadre of lawyers , who themselves are chosen by ` professional associations ' , the parliament are the ones that nominate those in the council , which then select the judges . 
  wow ok , seems like they have a lot more control over who gets appointed now . 
  how is it done in other countries , like the us ? 
  well the president tries to appoint federal judges , and the senate confirms them . 
  how is that different ? 
  well it 's basically the same thing in reverse . 
  the parliament does the nomination of the nominators , and the president confirms them . 
  if anything , it is one more layer removed . 
  so i guess the us is also an autocracy ? 
  the other bill , where they wish to replace judges , seems kind of obvious in light of this . 
  they want judges to be chosen by the parliament and president , like many other countries do , rather than this weird system they have now . 
  i do n't even understand how the judiciary was so independent before , while also getting to decide if parliamentary elections are valid . 
  seems more like restoring checks and balances than removing them ... maybe i 'm completely misunderstanding the situation and someone can enlighten me ? 
  are they choosing those jobs ? 
  that would suggest that they think it 's their best option . 
  just because it looks terrible to you does n't really mean anything . 
  it 's actually far simpler than it looks when you start to think of them as letters interspersed with letter combinations like ` cz ' , ` sz ' , ` rz ' , ` dzi ' , etc. 
  i think of them as distinct letter blocks , much like ` sh ' or ` ch ' in english tend to be . 
  so a word like ` szcz\u0119\u015bcie ' looks to me more like sz-cz-\u0119\u015bcie , which is far easier to handle . 
  it appears as though macron and trump get along very well . 
  i 'm surprised after the comments both made earlier , but it 's nice to see . 
  why would you make them obey your rules then ? 
  i know you said it 's your house , your rules . 
  but why would you want your rules followed just because it 's your house ? 
  the fact that it 's your house means you have the right to set the rules , but why not just adopt theirs to make them comfortable ? 
  no it 's not . 
  if another culture is in compliance with your laws and customs , then you are defacto saying that yours is superior to theirs . 
  that 's why theirs has to yield to yours . 
  otherwise , you would simply let them live with their own distinct set of laws and customs . 
  well to do so , you would need to take a stance that one culture is better than another . 
   is n't that ironic coming from the fact that a coalition of media owned by murdoch bankrolled trump bankrolled huh ? 
  sounds bad . 
  how much money did he receive from murdoch btw ? 
   i mean society in general seems to dislike the man for a good variety of reasons , not just because some newspapers `` said so '' , like you want to believe . 
  why not ? 
  the media tells you he 's racist , and you believe them because many people passively watch the media and do n't really question them . 
  then your friends are saying that he is racist , because they heard it on the media , and that just serves as confirmation to you that he must be , since that 's what everyone around you believes . 
  notice that the media does n't really talk about how racist he is anymore ? 
  they are getting more mileage out of the russian narrative now . 
  eventually , they 'll go back to saying he 's like hitler again . 
   are you missing the current scandals with his son ? 
  it 's still incredible , that you have such a clear cut case of collusion , which is rare in history that it 's so well documented . 
  at this point the only thing that would be so stronger would be trump outright saying `` i hate the u.s , long live tsar putin '' . 
  what scandal ? 
  i mean , tell me in your own words what you actually know about it and what is so bad . 
  i see that his son met a russian lawyer . 
  not a russian lawyer affiliated with the government , but some random russian lawyer . 
  he did this because she claimed to have information that would be damaging to clinton . 
  that 's called opposition research and everyone does it . 
  it turned out to be a waste of a meeting because she had nothing and really just wanted to talk about some unrelated sanctions . 
  his son was transparent and released emails concerning it . 
  that is more than can be said for clinton . 
  so what is the scandal here ? 
  well for one thing , she was n't even supposed to be in the country due to visa expiration , but obama 's doj gave her a tiny extension to deal with a particular case she was involved in . 
  however , she was in the country in june . 
  why ? 
  no one can explain that as of yet because she had no legal right to be here . 
  perhaps it was specifically to try and entrap trump . 
  she is apparently connected somehow to the same people that released the pissgate dossier , the stupid report from some ex-mi5 agent that said trump was getting pissed on by russian hookers in a hotel somewhere without any evidence . 
  i do n't get how you guys can continue believing after that shit ...  well , that and there 's also problems with political dynasties and nepotism with trump , refusal to distance himself from his businesses , constant political flip-flopping apart with russia and just general incompetence as an administrator . 
  would you prefer we focused on that instead ? 
  because the whole line that would tolerate legit criticisms of trump rings hollow when any criticisms that come from outside your group is deemed as `` propaganda '' . 
  hahaha . 
  refusal to distance himself from his businesses ? 
  there is no such criteria to be president . 
  it would be retarded to force him to sell everything he has built over his life just to be able to run ... 
  regardless , he has divested himself as much as possible and put his children in charge of it . 
  the incompetence thing is just the media programming showing . 
  they always call him incompetent , but what exactly do you mean by that ? 
   what problems do you have with him than ? 
  if you 're going to do an interview flaw like `` he 's too honest '' spare me the bullshit . 
  nepotism i agree with . 
  i do n't think his family should be involved at all other than melania as first lady . 
  i have no idea what qualifies jared or ivanka to do anything other than give him advice . 
  they do n't seem to actually be doing that much yet though , and i hope that continues . 
  so you can drop the whole , `` you guys are a cult '' meme , because if you believe that then you 've never visited / r/the _ donald and know nothing about us . 
  i have many criticisms . 
  i just do n't bother sharing them since there is already plenty of material for the haters to latch on to and i support trump in general . 
  we debate stuff sometimes in / r/the _ donald , but we are forced to cheer lead because of all the bullshit negativity . 
  you should have seen the response when he fired that missile into syria ...  well , why do you keep on responding ? 
  stubbornness , fun , rage or just frustration ? 
  in my case , it 's just because it gives something to do , that and a curiosity to see who leaves first . 
  frankly , you 've been here longer than most of the brexit guys , and at least you 've have n't just yelled `` maga '' and left ( yet ) . 
  amusement , primarily , but also a genuine interest in what the haters believe . 
  believe it or not , i do like to hear and consider legitimate criticisms .
