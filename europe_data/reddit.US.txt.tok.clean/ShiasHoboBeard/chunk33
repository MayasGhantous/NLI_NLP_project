  how exactly do you derive hate speech laws from the intent of the us constitution ? 
  do you have any materials , even in german , related to that ? 
  i find it really hard to believe . 
   it 's vague because it 's foreign to you . 
  no , it 's vague by definition because whether an action is hateful or incites hatred is relative . 
   that you do have lots of laws abridging the freedom of speech or of the press that exist anyway . 
  most of them are widely accepted and respected since the us - like any other nation on the planet - understands that unrestricted free speech is impossible and something that ca n't work in practice . 
  societies can literally not function if you allow all kinds of speech with no exceptions . 
  that 's just your german worldview speaking . 
  there is no reason unrestricted free speech is impossible . 
  the only exceptions i can imagine are a direct threat of physical violence , which is an act of coercion , or fraud , which is theft , and they are only exceptions because they can not be separated from their physical counterparts . 
   that 's how the us does laws in general to my understanding , where you start with a generic broad statement or idea ( think 2nd amendment ) and then tack on exceptions over time and keep trying to interpret it as society changes . 
  the initial statement , if we can even understand the intent properly after all that time , is comparatively irrelevant to legal practice . 
  you would make a great us judge lol . 
  that 's how they perceive the constitution , as a living document that outlines general principles which they are meant to clarify into specific law . 
  the men who originally wrote the laws might take issue with that . 
  :p it 's not hard to understand the intent for us because we can look at the debates and writings of people who created the document to know the purpose of each part . 
   you mean to respect your personal interpretation of the constitution as a layman which is just as irrelevant as my personal interpretation of it . 
  you 're basically claiming that judges and lawmakers have been ignoring the us constitution for hundreds of years in some cases - it 's you who has the extremist view then , not the judges or lawmakers . 
  actually , i am literally quoting the constitution . 
  and yes , they have ignored the us constitution many times . 
  this is not even debatable . 
  you do realize that supreme court justices disagree with each other on the constitution all the time , right ? 
  that would imply , assuming that there is a correct answer , that one side is wrong . 
   at that point the discussion is done since you show zero intent of trying to understand other sides and their reasoning . 
  if i say `` gun laws in the eu way are way better than the us '' then i 'm uninformed and making an irrational statement without even an attempt at understanding the idea of why us culture does it difference in the first place . 
  `` my/our way is better and everyone else is misled/an idiot/hasn ' t seen the light '' is a pretty dumb stance in any discussion . 
  it 's pretty much based entirely on projection and ignorance . 
  no i do n't believe it does . 
  i have heard the arguments from the other side and evaluated the evidence , after which i came to a conclusion . 
  i ca n't say that both are equal or reasonable , because that would imply that i would be fine with either standard , and i would certainly not want the gun laws from most countries in europe . 
  the very fact that you have different laws than we do implies that you think your way is better . 
  ( if you approve of the law i mean ), 
   neither country prohibits the burning of religious symbols to my knowledge , yet the reason for the guys arrest in the us was `` on suspicion of one count of unlawful symbol burning '' . 
  well the uk has a vague hate speech law . 
  burning that book could symbolize hatred for muslims . 
  anything could be construed as inciting hatred , but that is their law . 
  our states can also have backwards laws regarding book burning , symbols , or whatever , but they are superseded by the constitution . 
   your law is not clear on the matter . 
  what 's mostly clear is the modern interpretation of said laws and that 's something ~ 80 years old . 
  look at the reasoning given for chaplinsky where parts of the idea are still in effect today . 
  the law is clear , it is the courts who began to carve out exceptions . 
  that is my point . 
  what is unclear about :  ** congress shall make no law ** respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or ** abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ** ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . 
   saying `` at least the us is clear '' and implying the way the us does is straight up better is extremely ignorant there and relies entirely on projection . 
  i disagree . 
  the us way is better , aside from the violations that you pointed out . 
  clearly we need to do a better job of educating our judges to respect the constitution instead of consider it their task to interpret its meaning . 
  and you are just getting started . 
  it appears that the goal for germany is to rely on renewables for 45 % of its electricity generation by 2030 , and 100 % by 2050 . 
  that will mean far higher prices and reliability issues . 
  i know they do n't like nuclear there , but what about natural gas ? 
  probably the most disgusting thing is that your industry is exempt from paying the tax because they argue that it would make them uncompetitive globally if they were forced to do that ( true ) , so the citizens end up subsidizing everything . 
  at least your souls will be pure though . 
  that 's exactly what it 's for . 
  it 's to rally your supporters . 
  you should look up the definition of the word . 
  here , i 'll post it for you . 
   a mass meeting of people making a political protest or showing support for a cause . 
  or the verb  bring together ( forces ) again in order to continue fighting . 
   bring or come together in order to support a person or cause or for concerted action . 
   stopped reading there , this is your mind on breitbart not sure what breitbart has to do with anything . 
  it was widely reported on . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/barack-obama-deliberately-snubbed-by-chinese-in-chaotic-arrival-at-g20 https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/world/asia/china-obama-group-of-20-summit-airport-arrival.html http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/obama-gets-his-staircase-227734 http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/04/barack-obama-snubbed-on-the-tarmac-arrival-at-china-g20/ http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/china-forces-barack-obama-emerge-air-force-ones-ass-sharp-diplomatic-snub-1579558, 
  then you do n't really understand the purpose of a rally . 
   there is no law in the uk that makes burning a bible or koran illegal so in your opinion this is also a case of courts and police acting in contradiction of the law i presume ? 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  i 'm saying that the first amendment allows burning a bible , but that does n't mean that people are immune to being arrested by police or attacked by our court system . 
  it 's not a magic power . 
  trump has the right to restrict any kind of immigration from aliens according to our law , yet his executive orders are being challenged by the courts . 
  even though the law is clear , it does not always determine what happens in these cases . 
   first , europe is not a state - the eu does n't have any blasphemy laws . 
  yeah , the eu is not a state either . 
  many countries in europe have hate speech or blasphemy laws . 
  i do n't think it matters whether the laws are used now or not . 
  ( i could link you cases where they are , but what good would that do ? ), 
  the fact that they are law means that you could fall afoul of them at any time . 
   overall calling people getting charged or convicted because of the burning of religious books in europe `` common or accepted '' does seem highly dishonest and false , but maybe you have sources that can establish that kind of claim that i 'm not aware of . 
  no i meant it is much more common to charge people for speech crimes in europe . 
  some cases involving the koran are starting to crop up here in the us unfortunately , but at least our law is clear on the matter . 
  you have n't refuted it in any way . 
  duterte called our last president a ` son of a whore ' and told him to ` go to hell ' . 
  i would say our current relationship is definitely improved . 
  you agree with me on japan . 
  china forced obama to use the back of his plane rather than provide a ramp . 
  xi is currently helping trump with north korea . 
  israel , judging by the press conference with bibi on trump 's visit , is overjoyed with him compared to obama . 
  and saudi arabia put on a really impressive display to welcome the new president . 
  they appreciate his tough stance on iran and qatar as contrasted with [ obama 's agreement with iran . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/barack-obama-saudi-arabia-visit-king-salman-relationship ), 
  you have a [ renewable energy surcharge of 24 % . 
  ] ( https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/what-german-households-pay-power ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_renewable_energy_sources_act http://www.dw.com/en/german-electricity-price-is-half-taxes-and-fees/a-17849142 edit : wow , i just reread that dw article and realized that the amount you pay in renewable subsidies per kwh is almost the same as what i pay in ** total ** per kwh . 
  your electricity is around 4x as expensive as mine . 
  well it 's kind of obvious that he would want to visit the places that supported him most . 
  apparently this is [ fake news ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-usa-iduskbn1920oc ) . 
  do most presidents hold rallies after getting into office ? 
  was obama really scared also ? 
  well he is , it just depends on the allies . 
  japan , the philippines , china , israel , saudi arabia , etc. 
  not mexico or germany , but you ca n't argue that he has n't improved relations with anyone .
