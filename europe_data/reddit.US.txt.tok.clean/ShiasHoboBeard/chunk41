  it 's just a really stupid deal all around , especially for such a paltry overall effect on the climate . 
  so to compensate for that advantage , we should allow china and india to pollute just like us for the next 13 years until they can catch up ? 
  i thought this was about saving the planet from some co2 disaster . 
  why would you allow the biggest producers of co2 to continue to act normally then ? 
  it does n't make any sense to ` be fair ' to them if the end result is that we all die , right ? 
  which is completely ridiculous . 
  if the problem is that we are producing too much co2 as a planet , then the absolute number needs to go down . 
  allowing china or india to rapidly develop , all the while spewing co2 as normal tells me that this agreement is more about draining wealth from america than it is about the environment . 
  supposedly it might already be too late to do anything about this problem . 
  how does allowing china and india to pollute at the same rate for 13 more years help that ? 
  yeah , they contributed to the kernel that you are using right now . 
  the us has been vilified for ages now . 
  the opinion of europeans on our nation is worth little these days . 
  it is a huge overreach of power . 
  it seems clear to me that the reason for the majority approval being stipulated by the constitution is precisely to prevent one man from entangling the us in global commitments . 
  so having ` executive agreements ' makes no sense unless you just want to bypass the senate . 
  of course our constitution does n't seem to mean much these days , and the courts are rather political now , so who knows what will end up happening . 
  clearly old enough to vote . 
  if they can increase emissions until 2030 , then that means they are increasing pollution . 
  so what are you on about ? 
   however , did we just potentially consider china better on the environment than the us ? 
  china ... the nation the west has built up with our insatiable need for disposable material goods . 
  no , not remotely . 
  the us agreed to and was expected to do way more on emissions , even though our total output is much less than theirs . 
  and we 're only assuming that this agreement will even do something useful after draining our resources and sending them to lesser developed countries , which i 'm not convinced of at all . 
  you need to read those articles again . 
  there are no targets set by the paris agreement , everyone submits their own goals . 
  the very first link you gave says this :  china submits carbon-curbing plan to un ahead of paris climate change summit , saying it will ** ` work hard ' to peak emissions earlier than 2030 target ** peak means ` reach the height of ' , or in other words , that their emissions will increase until 2030 . 
  are you just making shit up ? 
  the contributions are determined by each nation involved , and china said they are n't reducing emissions until 2030 . 
  they are also fighting against transparency , one part of the agreement , and outright refused another , the 5 year reassessment . 
  i 'm sure they 're doing a great job improving their own country 's environmental disaster , but that 's a separate thing . 
  yeah i bet you do n't . 
  the epic whining from your side alone makes me glad i voted . 
  i read that as , `` we want to reduce the amount of carbon emitted per gdp increase , but we 're absolutely going to keep growing '' yeah that sounds wonderful , why do n't we sign up for that deal ? 
  we can strive to be more efficient but not promise to reduce total emissions at all . 
  we 'd like to grow our economy too . 
  and let 's not forget :  china has so far rejected proposals by the e.u. 
  to review emissions cuts every five years . 
  a quick trip to wikipedia adds :  in 2015 , official statistics revealed that previous statistics had been systematically underestimated by 17 % , corresponding to the entire co2 emissions of germany . 
  and this ,  in april 2017 coal-powered electricity production hit a new record high . 
  the truth is that china 's move to renewables is driven more by necessity than anything else . 
  we all know how polluted their cities are . 
  the us is not nearly so bad in this regard . 
  just for that i 'm going to vote trump in 2020 . 
  i 'm glad trump is withdrawing . 
  our country was going to spend a ridiculous amount of money for a nebulous gain , at a time when our jobs are disappearing . 
  i 'm all for companies doing what they can to reduce their impact but this deal was insane . 
  the worst part is there is no fixed cost , and it says that the amount paid will be continuously re-evaluated . 
  ( upwards , of course ), 
  how many american companies contributed code to that linux distribution you are using ? 
  i guarantee one of them was redhat . 
  according to the submissions made by each country , we were supposed to drop our emissions by 28 % around 2025 , while china was supposed to * hopefully peak emissions * by ** 2030 ** . 
  so they can increase pollution while we are supposed to cut back ? 
  we are already hurting for jobs here . 
  i live in the south , and this propaganda was so effective that i was shocked upon hearing that even our poorest states are on par with many european countries . 
  people make it sound like we live in caves over here . 
  are we including the us military 's emissions ? 
  because you know they are the ones securing worldwide oceanic trade routes and allowing europe to output less co2 maintaining their own forces . 
  i do n't think it 's so easy to compare everyone by just looking at raw emissions per capita . 
   and as things stand , china and india have around 3 billion of people to think of , while the implementation of the accord will slow down their growth in the short-term . 
  how will it do that ? 
  have you read what their contribution is supposed to be ? 
  edit : oh please , downvote me . 
  china is not doing shit about their growth through this agreement . 
  go fucking read instead of jumping on the us hate bandwagon . 
   and besides , there 's a reason he 's basically calling americans to ignore trump 's decisions . 
  within hours , california , new york and washington states are rebelling . 
  implementation of the plan - or the lack of it - apparently depends on the specific states . 
  no it does n't . 
  they are choosing to apply their own standards for themselves , which is exactly what is expected in our system . 
  the states are supposed to govern and set their own rules rather than have them imposed from on high . 
   this is trump , and the party that supports him , being literal man-children that want to `` stick it to obama !!!! 1 ! '', 
  this is ridiculous . 
  even if you supported the intention and believed in the cause , obama could not promise this kind of thing . 
  it 's not his place to make deals like this . 
  it 's up to the senate to ratify global treaties and they have not voted on this agreement . 
  what he 's saying is that treaties need to be approved by the senate , and that this one has n't been voted on . 
  who signed this treaty ? 
  the senate has to approve by a 2/3 majority on any such agreement . 
   white house senior adviser brian deese said the president has the legal authority to ratify the accord without the two-thirds senate vote required for treaties . 
  he said the pact negotiated by 195 countries in december is merely an * `` executive agreement . '' * oh wow how convenient , apparently we can just get around our laws by calling something that looks exactly like a treaty , something other than a treaty ... 
  sorry , but this thing is in no way legally binding . 
  obama ca n't just unilaterally decide to kneecap our economy for fun . 
  those would cost less than this deal . 
  well it 's pretty easy to be party to a convention when you do n't have to actually sacrifice anything to be in it . 
  everyone who is circle jerking about this should check out what china 's contributions are supposed to be , according to the agreement . 
  i 'll give you a hint , zero . 
  as in , zero reduction of carbon emissions by 2030 . 
  they are going to * hope that they peak * by 2030 ... 
  i guess that explains why people are so easily trolled .

   or not , if we manage to integrate them . 
  we have had migrants from africa for a couple centuries now , they are actually to the level of the begining of the xxth century for france . 
  yeah that 's why your country hides all statistics having to do with race . 
  would n't want anyone to know how successful you are in integrating everyone ...  do not assume anything about europe , you obviously do know shit about it . 
  in france for exemple , every single citizen is free but also equals to each others . 
  all the bs we see about blacks people being thrown out in jail , killing each others or by cops , all the segregation happening in the usa with cities 100 % filled with people from this color or that one , do not and can not exist here . 
  even your politicians and scholars [ admit what you refuse to see ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/25/frances-ethnic-apartheid-separate-islamic-societie/ ) . 
  the only difference between your country and ours in terms of race is that yours is still more homogenous .
