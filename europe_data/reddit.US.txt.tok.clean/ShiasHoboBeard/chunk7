  my links say so . 
  you 're full of shit . 
  america is actually less segregated than the uk . 
  on average , blacks in america live in neighborhoods that are [ 45 % black ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/most-segregated-cities-in-america-2013-11?op=1/#-miami-fort-lauderdale-pompano-beach-florida-1 ) . 
  and how do you explain hispanic segregation , if it 's all just historical racism ? 
  i do n't remember when they were slaves ... 
  the reason it does n't seem like the uk is segregated is probably because you are n't that diverse to begin with .

  even in this thread there are people mocking us americans and how we talk about europeans destroying themselves while our own cities are violent . 
  well yeah , that kind of makes us the experts on ** what not to do ** , does n't it ? 
  if we ca n't integrate everyone after centuries then it seems rather arrogant to think that you will do better . 
  youth , or `` youth '' ? 
  actually , you did n't get it . 
  i 'm saying that it does n't necessarily have to be the case . 
  there 's no reason we could n't produce more american or japanese cars over german ones in america . 
  i very much agree with your posts , although i 'm not as certain as you that there is a distinction to be made between islamism and islam itself . 
  there are moderates and there are extremists , but the ideology seems to favor the latter and not leave room for reform . 
  one difference with christianity that makes me doubtful about the possibility of an islamic reformation is that the bible is seen as the product of divine inspiration but interpreted and written by the fallible hands of man . 
  the quran , perhaps in an attempt to be superior to christianity , is hand delivered directly from god by an archangel . 
  this would suggest that altering the text or its meaning is not possible without admitting that god made an error . 
  ( or destroying the image of their prophet ) i have n't even gone into the massive cultural differences ( like their honor system , clan-based loyalty structure , etc ) yet . 
  i do n't want to get too far off track , just explain why i am much more pessimistic about the integration than most . 
  i think we can both agree that there are only two options , either the nationalistic and secular french mindset wins or it does not , and the enthusiasm is not on the side of the french at the moment . 
  i do n't mean muslims alone , but non-europeans . 
  compare the numbers again . 
  irrelevant . 
  we could move to japanese manufacturers instead , or focus on domestic manufacturers . 
  you ca n't make up a new market the size of the us to export to . 
  is california a country ? 
  so how would you do that exactly ? 
  either merge everything or do n't , but the current situation of the eu will not last . 
  not at all . 
  i hate the eu but love poland , and am a polish citizen . 
  there is no contradiction there . 
   eu members ca n't sign individual trade agreements . 
  period . 
  yeah , that 's why he does n't like the eu . 
   give me an example of eu taking advantage of the us in trade . 
  just please do n't say european cars because it 's literally not our fault that we make better cars . 
  where did i specifically say the eu ? 
  do n't take my comments so personally . 
  but since you asked , one way that the eu does take advantage of us is through their vat , which we do not have . 
  are european cars better ? 
  it 's hard to tell , since it does n't make financial sense to export us cars to the eu . 
   whatever lets you sleep at night . 
  but that 's all rationalizing what is essentially continental destabilization , and divide and conquer . 
  what are you on about ? 
  trump wants to trade with countries by signing individual deals with them , so obviously he will be against the eu because that 's really a multilateral deal . 
  how are you translating that to ` continental destabilization ' and ` divide and conquer ' ? 
  the us has been taken advantage of on trade by almost all of its partners , many of whom are much smaller in size , yet the minute someone like trump seeks to rectify that issue and equalize things , he is seen as a monster seeking to destroy everything lol . 
  in a way , i guess you are right . 
  he is trying to destroy the retarded status quo . 
  why throw a tantrum over it ? 
   the fact that you do n't get that , that you 've confused the office and the man , and that you consider his personal feelings worthy of becoming national policy , is worrying . 
  i 'm sure you 've noticed that they are one and the same right now . 
  institutions also come and go , and criticism of the eu is not the same as attacking europe . 
  the eu is not a country , and there is no reason to accord it the same respect as one . 
  of course it will . 
  france is not yet as diverse as america . 
  you seem determined to follow in our footsteps though . 
  and the longer you wait , the more difficult it becomes as the demographics are decidedly against you . 
  i do n't see a positive future for france given the rhetoric from politicians there , and the response from citizens after the most recent attacks . 
  at least they are being smart about security . 
  i always thought that there were only two options for dealing with extremism : either do n't invite it in , or have a massive security apparatus to try and preempt their attacks . 
  when presented with those choices honestly , who would opt for the second ? 
  the palestinian thing was always so strange and difficult to understand for me . 
  how could this situation possibly drag on for so long ? 
  then i realized that nobody wants it to be solved , because it would then cease to be a tool for arab countries to antagonize israel with . 
  once you see it for what it is , basically a terrorist training ground on the enemy 's border , your perspective on the whole region is changed . 
  it 's hard to be indifferent when something like this is allowed to happen . 
  oh , are we calling that normal now ? 
  and at that time , it would have made sense to reject them or at least subject them to intense scrutiny . 
  we take close to a million immigrants a year , far more than any other country . 
  we have ** 20 % of all immigrants in the world ** , and they make up ** 1/4 of our population ** . 
  the stats are deceptive because children are automatically granted citizenship if they are born here , which is not the case in other countries and means their stats can be artificially inflated compared to ours . 
  trump was attacked as a candidate by european leaders . 
  why is n't it ok for him to criticize the eu ? 
  it would hurt you more than us . 
  you 're a net exporter to the us to the tune of $ 150 billion . 
  germany 's auto industry in particular is quite vulnerable . 
  ( the us is the single largest destination for german auto exports at 16 % of the total ), 
   no , it will not . 
  it will alienate poles , and with good reason . 
   we ca n't afford to have an open conflict with a country of 40 million , our eastern neighbor , and esp . 
  not during these crazy times . 
  and i 'm not talking about business - no , we politically ca n't afford it . 
  you are right about this though . 
  it would sow discord within the eu and push poles closer to americans and the uk , at a time where the eu really ca n't afford such infighting . 
  right , so the only difference here is that pis had power at the time . 
  you say that ` the system worked ' , but only because the old regime was on the way out . 
   yes he did . 
  how ? 
   his strongest advisor is a fucking white supremacist , on top of that . 
  did n't you hear ? 
  trump is also a racist apparently . 
  so is his new ag . 
  basically anyone who is republican and opposes democrats is a potential kkk member ... 
  uh , did n't civic platform try to appoint two judges illegally ? 
  seems to me that the problem did n't begin with the current government , even if they are also guilty of not following the rules . 
   i say good for germany and also japan and south korea too .
