  [ aw snap ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwqn0kth6a1qfhek7.gif ), 
  imperialism , plain and simple . 
  yeah !, 
  hang him upside down from one of those gasoline price-billboard thingies !, 
  he 's from hawaii . 
  subsidized by a corrupt country that 's funding a genocidal army and that continues to encourage oppression on women , lgbt people , and anyone who 's not a sunni arab ? 
  no thanks . 
  they have no choice . 
  it 's either remain as a concubine with your douchey aggressive ex-boyfriend , or get anally raped by the rich oil businessman next door who 's holding your kid in chains in the basement . 
  i just wish armenia could have better relations in the west , especially with france , germany , and the united states ( who love love love armenians ) , without russia abusing them in jealousy . 
  hmm , well i guess [ everything ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_of_kurdish_people_in_turkey ) 's [ fine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_saudi_arabia ) and [ dandy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_iran ) in the middle east for [ gays ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_syria ) and [ kurds ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-anfal_campaign ) . 
  because breivik is one lone case and does n't have millions of people rallying behind him , nor is he getting billions funded to him by backwards authoritarian states . 
  seems like every country has this rich north-poor south divide . 
  ( and below the equator , it 's the opposite . ), 
  i ca n't think of a single country that is an exception . 
  well they 're number 3 for lowest latitude only behind iceland and finland , so they 've got that going for them that norway and sweden do n't ... 
  something was lifting up, 
  i know that feel bro : / people here love to blame the opposite political party for what 's happening with isis . 
  as if they 're all like robot-puppets programmed by congress . 
  meanwhile everyone in the middle east 's heads explode . 
  *** applause ***, 
  like i said , homophobia in the south/rural us is * nothing * compared to eastern europe . 
  if a pride parade is held in birmingham or biloxi , people will roll their eyes at it , and maybe curse under their breath , but nobody 's going to throw molotovs at the floats . 
  by that logic i [ guess this invalidates the holocaust then ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_and_expulsion_of_germans_ ( 1944 % e2 % 80 % 9350 \\ ) ) oh wait no that 's the worst logic ive ever heard of and now i feel filthy for stooping to your level, 
  [ * [ citation needed ] intensifies * ], 
  little turkish girls and boys were n't mutilated and slaughtered en masse you oaf edit : and he gets even stupider . 
  bro how low can u go, 
  woah there sonic the edgehog , you 're going to fas, 
  after reading the comments on this thread i 'm starting to believe you 're right . 
  the homophobia especially in eastern europe is on a completely different level from homophobia in the south and rural us . 
  you can thank the soviet union for that, 
  have russia 's abominable anti-gay laws been covered by your media ? 
  has that have an effect on public opinion ? 
  i 've been told constantly that pretty much every european outside of like belarus and serbia despise russia , so it would be interesting to see if the enemy-of-my-enemy effect extends to lgbt tolerance . 
  seriously . 
  this is what bothered me so much about the repeal of dadt in the united states . 
  not that i support discrimination in the military based on orientation , nor that i think that lgbt people should n't serve . 
  but the reactions to it were very concerning . 
  all these people rejoicing that people could blow up , but `` hey it 's ok now at least they could express themselves '' . 
  the military-industrial concept being * slightly * more inclusive is hardly a step in equality . 
  but meanwhile all these straight people in the military `` yay we 're equal now we 're done here '' , never mind that transgender people still ca n't join , or the fact that the rape rate for gay men in the military is ridiculous -- and neither issue is addressed . 
  also the fact that people think * social * prejudice is completely wiped blank because * legal * prejudice is no longer an issue ... just boggles my mind . 
  `` we did it guys , homophobia is over ! '', 
  is such a dangerous and destructive perception to have . 
  even years after dadt was repealed , most of my friends * still * ca n't get married or even do something like hold hands in safety or fall in love without hatred from their families . 
  and despite having a full tour in afghanistan , my ex was kicked out of a club with his bf because `` we do n't like queers here '' . 
  anyway , sorry for ranting . 
  i just wish the right to serve your country is a two-way street-their safety is protected from foreign and domestic danger , but you in turn have your rights protected by the state . 
  it 's particularly disgusting that germany and austria do n't have full blue and purple bars . 
  it 's astounding how drastic the drop-off is when comparing the first 15 to the later additions . 
  with the exceptions of malta and slovenia and croatia , there 's a depressing void of human rights with the later 13 . 
  ok , now i 'm getting a clearer image . 
  thanks for your contribution !, 
   dealing an immediate and serious blow to our eu-friendly political parties that would then be accused of letting brussels pass `` laws that legalize perversion '' , and it could even escalate into an all-out political crisis . 
  also , i would expect the society to actually become more resentful of the gay population in such a scenario . 
  damn , really ? 
  :( i 'm sorry that 's how it is over there . 
  i 'm so fortunate to live in such a gay-friendly region . 
  because it discourages prejudice and gives oppressed classes more protection i can see where you 're coming from , tho . 
  do you think the eu can ever step in ? 
  it would be amazing if the human rights courts helped legalize all those fields eu-wide by the end of the decade . 
  this means that you 'd be punished more for targeting someone because of their sexuality . 
  for example a group of neo-nazis assaulting participants in a gay pride festival would be treated more severely than if they went and beat up opposing fans at a football game . 
  this also applies to gay people attacking straight people , even though that does n't happen for obvious reasons . 
  what about kurds , and lgbt people ? 
  why does n't finland just enter a 3rd-party alliance with other neutral states like sweden and austria ? 
  goodness gracious , literally only ** 2 ** people from outside of west africa have been infected . 
  and the latest news update states that there 's a 99 % chance this dude * does n't * have ebola . 
  but hey , all aboard the hysteria bandwagon i guess ~ ~ ~, 
  countries that have all 7 : belgium ( bel ) , france ( fra ) , netherlands ( ndl ) , denmark ( dan ) , spain ( esp ) , sweden ( sve ) , uk ( except for ni - __ - ) countries that are nearly there !, 
  : finland ( suo ) countries that are only 1 away !, 
  : malta , northern ireland and the country currently in last is latvia . 
  but i still believe in you !, 
  creds to wikipedia for the [ original image ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:lgbt_rights_in_the_eu_ ( 2013-07 \\ ) . svg ) , 
  because the people against this are n't for a two-state solution , they 're for a one state solution . 
  they want revenge , they wish to see palestine controlling the entirety of israel under muslim rule . 
  japan was never fascist . 
  what 's the difference between serbians and montenegrins ? 
  portugal ca n't into relevant :d, 
  corruption corruption corruption corruption corruption corruption, 
  heck , italy was the richest region in the world from the the crusades to the age of the triangular trade when spain and flanders outpaced italy 's economy . 
  latinos * can * be white . 
  most latinos at least have some blood that gives them white heritage . 
  but to me , the lines between latino and white are so messy and vague and complicated i just basically see any native spanish speaker or someone with descent from an iberian country as latino . 
  thank you so much for your recommendations !, 
  i 'd say just as often as any other race hates each other , especially judging by this thread . 
  getting prejudice from both white americans and latinos , i have to say that racism is more frequent from white natives , but less severe . 
  and like 85 % of the time , it 's not racism from skin color per se , it 's more linguicism or xenophobia . 
  being white-skinned , i have n't really gotten flack from whites for my skin but i have heard other rudeness . 
  and when it comes to concealed racism , i do n't know who has more * total * , white americans or latinos , i ca n't read thoughts . 
  but i know as a percentage of their racism , white people are a lot more convert . 
  hispanics do n't trip . 
  and i think the whole culture we 've had since the like 90s , where white people have more guilt and even the ones who do n't want to look like the simon legrew trope , and will make the best effort to be noticed as prejudicial . 
  but we do n't have filters . 
  latinos on the other hand are very upfront about well , everything . 
  we 're not afraid to wear our thoughts on our sleeve and make our feelings visible . 
  of course , they 're not intrusive , hence the spanish , but when we talk behind people 's backs in spanish we feel like we have a leg up on you . 
  and yes we know you know we 're talking about you , but there 's some enjoyment that 's * all * you know . 
  so while my experiences with prejudice or racism or whatever you call it are n't as frequent , they 're very blunt and more severe and hurtful . 
  do n't get me wrong , latinos are the best customers tbh , and i 'm not just saying that .
