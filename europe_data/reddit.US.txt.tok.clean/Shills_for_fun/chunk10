  all i am saying is that , while it is an example of free speech , it 's not targeted toward religious extremists . 
  it 's also targeted at the jordanian guy who opened a restaurant in michigan because he wants to provide a good life for his kids . 
  i 'm not saying we should censor things to make people happy , i 'm just saying the draw muhammad thing is completely misguided . 
  while i think religion in general is silly , particularly the `` you ca n't draw our prophet '' bit , people have a right to be offended when you mock their beliefs . 
  the draw muhammad thing may be targeted at lunatics far away , but the collateral damage extends to pretty much any muslim , most of whom take abuse in silence in their home countries without flipping out . 
  [ looks like they were going to do a 5-point likert scale with an additional `` i do n't know '' category , but decided `` ah fuck it let 's just do frequencies . '', 
  here 's the full data ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/g96awulgzv/eurotrack_minorities_w.pdf ) your question , as a researcher , is exactly why i hate likert scales in surveys as the * only * method used in data collection just because it 's `` quantitative . '', 
  this data , to me , is slightly illuminating but meaningless . 
   personally , i think these jokes are a good thing . 
  it 's a way for us to not take our origins too seriously . 
  i think this position , as a parisian , may be easier for you to swallow as part of a majority group . 
  being half-american is essentially meaningless ; you 're french , in france . 
  american is a nationality , not an ethnicity . 
  i also do n't think an arab/black/muslim / asian coworker will admit to being bothered by it , especially if the racism/sexism is as casually embedded in the workplace as you 're saying . 
  my opinion , i guess . 
  lol another nation-building adventure in the middle east ? 
  no thank you . 
  see , we can either install a democracy ( which would n't work anyway ) or we can install a brutal dictator like we used to and reap endless amounts of shit for it , forever . 
  the us needs to stay out of this game , period . 
  whenever we do something , we just make things worse !, 
  yep . 
  did i miss anything ? 
  just do n't make any imperial asian allies when you unite the continent this time . 
  love , america, 
  i might be in the minority on this one , but the opposition party in russia is the communist party . 
  no thank you . 
  putin is an asshole and kind of scary in terms of press freedom and conquering land from other countries , and i get why people hate him , but russia has done * way * worse in the past . 
  what helps keep out a lot of riff-raff is that most people here view international travel as a hellishly expensive , unapproachable thing . 
  which it is , if you 're a `` security blanket '' traveler . 
  high end restaurants , high end hotels/resorts , tour guides for * everything * . 
  i think the whole act of whipping out the proverbial fliff like a sultan creates that `` entitled traveler '' mentality . 
  i think the americans staying in hostels are probably going to be a less whiny and more into the cultural aspect of traveling . 
  we love seeing old stuff , like you would n't believe . 
  in our own country , if something was built in the 1800s , it is old and worth seeing and respecting . 
  when we 're in asia or europe ? 
  everything is awesome . 
  [ his blog ] ( http://blog.panampost.com/yael-ossowski/2015/06/04/persona-non-grata-in-serbia/ )  after this point , he asks that i come with him to the car to finish the paperwork . 
  in my own native country of canada and my adopted country of the united states , where i only recently became a citizen mother fucker !, 
  but he 's living in austria now , does that still count for shitty american tourist points ? 
  i do n't know why . 
  i guess it 's possible he was from canada originally and emigrated to the us ? 
  dual citizen ? 
  in either case , he uses a canadian website and speaks with a very thick quebecois accent . 
  edit : confirmed recent immigrant - . - ~ ~ maybe he was being a dick and thought throwing the `` u.s. '' out there would cause the cop to back down . 
  i vote for this option , because really , he sounds like the type of douche who would do something like that . 
  new hypothesis : courteous americans pretend to be canadian abroad . 
  canadian assholes pretend to be american abroad ! ~ ~, 
   entire thing has actually very nice irony to it . 
  ~ ~ speaking of irony , your comment is now kind of humorous considering you 're firing off a prejudice about americans when this guy is canadian . ~ ~ edit : we import shitty people too . 
   http://yael.ca you * also * can tell by his accent . 
  easily . 
  do n't feel bad , a bunch of chuckle-fucks in the youtube comments could n't tell either . 
   european countries , including serbia , are welcome to come to china to together drink water from the yangtze river :| should have chosen a better metaphor for cooperation . 
   `` we , or i , can not monitor everyone all of the time , '' he said . 
  `` if people want to do wrong , they will also try to hide it . 
  but it must also fall to me to be responsible for the reputation of our entire organization , and to find a way to fix things . '' this is going to be a fun thing to revisit when he 's running away from the fbi after warner ( and others ) roll on him . 
   actually , of all the people i met , germans seem to be the most non-nazi . 
  so ... which people that you 've met seem to be the most * nazi * ? 
  this seems like an idiotic move . 
  sure it was an attempt to cover his own ass , but did he seriously just throw all of those guys in custody under the bus ? 
  the guys who are probably considering plea deals with uncle sam so they do n't die in jail ? 
  might want to take a vacation to moscow , blatter . 
  like , a really long vacation . 
  you people still weigh stuff in stones . 
  sorry , you do n't get to join the `` har har look at their archaic measurement '' table !, 
   it 's so refreshing to hear a german talk with so much balls . 
  ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ german ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ being ^ ^ ^ kind ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ funny, 
  [ target acquired ] ( http://www.mch.govt.nz/files/images/nz-flag.jpg ), 
  we do n't learn geography until we start blowing up the place . 
  we 'll get it right eventually . 
  you might want to re-think the red state thing . 
  new orleans , louisiana is probably one of the best places you can visit in the u.s. culture , food , history , trolling through the swamps bothering alligators ... it has it all !, 
   i 'm just tired of everyone thinking that the us are '' the good guys '' nobody thinks this nowadays but eastern europeans , japanese , and filipinos . 
   finally , no uk means no us involvement , as even if they wanted to help they 'd have no launch pad from which to do it . 
  very true . 
  though we would n't have gotten involved either way if hitler did n't ally himself with a man of his own heart in tojo . 
  i doubt highly that we 'd go after germany economically . 
  just like we do n't go after china economically . 
  the us is a selfish country like any other ; we 're not going to tank the world economy for a diplomatic slap in the face . 
  just playing devil 's advocate , but why would you want the us to provide intelligence collected in an `` unethical '' ( i use quotes , because the ethics is debatable ) manner ? 
  should n't the message be `` invasion of privacy is not okay , we should only collect intel in a ____ manner '' ? 
  if we ( broadly ) value privacy to the point where an occasional plot slips through the cracks , that 's just the cost of liberty . 
  otherwise , are we not being hypocritical by calling snowden a hero ? 
  why ? 
  what could we possibly do to germany ? 
  we 're not protecting you from the soviets anymore . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's not why we broke serbia 's shit . 
  we love guns too much , have to bring them everywhere ... 
  or maybe they 're just racist . 
  did you read the article ? 
  it 's very obvious . 
  i know you did n't mean it like this , but i do n't see how being racist to chinese tourists is any better or even understandable . 
  as an american , i 'm sure you 'd be quite offended if some dutch cafe owner shooed you away from his business because american tourists are loud and always asking him about weed . 
  if you 're anti-us you might consider siding with the us 's opposition . 
  america deceived poland about the iraq war . 
  that 's probably the most prominent memory in most millennials these days , not the russian occupation . 
  the russian narrative on nato 's pretty easy to swallow if you consider the us a warmongering country . 
  i also crossed it off my list . 
  for now . 
  it sounds superficial but there are so many * other * places to go that do n't have a current national narrative of `` america 's trying to destroy us . '',
