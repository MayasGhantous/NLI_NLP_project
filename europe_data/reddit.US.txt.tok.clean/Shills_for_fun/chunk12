  the united states has visa restrictions for poland . 
  enough poles came here and just sort of stayed that they 're automatically flagged for immigration intent . 
  i have a family chock-full of plastic paddies . 
  the funny thing is some of the younger ones are oh-so-proud of their `` irish '' heritage , yet do n't seem to realize that their names are welsh . 
  or that their `` irish '' great grandmother was half german . 
  there 's nothing wrong with recognizing your ancestry but there 's nothing to be proud of in there either . 
  if you 'd lead us to the pot o ' gold , we 'd leave you alone . 
  happy st. paddy 's from ` merica . 
  we 're celebrating 1/64th of the holiday !, 
  uh , the ukraine crisis is rooted in kiev 's flirtations with the eu . 
  that is not obama 's problem . 
  it is possible to have both . 
  we have chinese in the us and many still celebrate chinese new year . 
  they also celebrate the 4th of july and consider themselves american . 
  you can have both identities . 
  another example is our mexican community . 
  they 're americans who still celebrate dia de los muertos , have qincea\u00f1eras , largely speak spanish at home , among other things . 
  they 're just as american as anyone else , they just have that as part of their own identity . 
  the american identity is n't just a broad stroke of boring vanilla . 
  if eu becomes federalized , the uk will definitely have to make a choice between europe and having its own network of allies like it currently has . 
  all that 's missing is a synthesizer and big bold fonts . 
   twin probably canada . 
  the us and canada have way more in common than any canadian cares to admit . 
  they are more progressive politically but beyond that , i really do n't feel a cultural divide like i do with western europeans . 
   ally i 'd say `` allies '' more than ally . 
  canada , uk , australia , and new zealand are indisputably the us 's biggest allies . 
   would n't mind joining my country i 'm going to pick puerto rico . 
  technically , they 're part of it already , but they 're in this weird friend-zone-like area where i 'd like to see them to obtain full statehood should they choose that . 
  considering the approval ratings of the us in turkey i find that hilarious . 
  if no one gave a shit about italy or greece , what makes you think a centralized decision would have been in their favor ? 
  united is a tricky issue . 
  in our federal system , we regularly impose our will on about 1/2 the country regularly . 
  the entire southeast would probably outlaw same sex marriage and go back to the old healthcare system in a heartbeat if we let them . 
  you 're probably just going to be silencing the dissent versus uniting around the issue . 
  for example , on ukraine , would you silence the eastern europeans who do n't trust russia and want to militarize the borders , or do you silence the western europeans who do n't want to rock the boat ? 
  meanwhile , here , the likely republican nominee is tweeting mussolini quotes non-ironically . 
  you 'd think a xiao laoban would like the low minimum wages ? 
  `` what is your business hier in germoney ? '', 
  `` terrorism '' `` tourism ? 
  have fun , please do n't be loud im bahnhof !,

  it 'll take your breath away . 
  literally . 
  forever . 
  nice try , american student fleeing student loan debt . 
  you ca n't forfeit your citizenship unless you have citizenship elsewhere . 
  does isis issue legal passports ? 
   people watch it for all the crazy bullshit it brings . 
  that and polish butter churning . 
  bernie sanders is really an anomaly in our system . 
  obama was never an outsider , he was just unknown and was able to convince people that he was going to be different . 
  bernie has been doing this for decades . 
  he 's not a democrat who , 10 years ago , would proudly defend doma and the `` traditional '' definition of marriage . 
  if bernie sanders was going to sell out , he would have done it ages ago . 
  his campaigns are fueled by small donations . 
  he does n't hold closed-door fundraisers with finance executives . 
  i hate to say it , but this might be my last time voting . 
  it 's weird to actually feel good about donating to a campaign and voting for the candidate . 
  i do n't want to go back to that hollow feeling i felt when i voted for obama . 
  a screw pops loose every time you read an error on the internet ? 
  you poor bastard . 
  well i posted it to the other guy , but when you go through immigration at the airport in most places , canadian and american citizens can use the same line . 
  that 's as bro as it gets . 
  i think there 's definitely a `` britishness '' or `` frenchness '' to canada depending on where you are , but as someone from michigan i felt very at home in ontario . 
  our accent is even pretty much the same . 
  come on , we use each other 's `` citizen only '' lines at immigration in the airport . 
  it does n't get more bro than filtering all of the other foreigners out . 
  the bodhisattva guanyin is usually depicted as a woman in chinese buddhism , though . 
  i 'm guessing you 've never been to china . 
  people are free to worship . 
  xinjiang culture is celebrated every chinese new year . 
  the hui have temples all over the place and you can find hallal food everywhere . 
  tibetan buddhism is alive and well in northern sichuan , but since the dalai lama is an anti-prc figure , they oppose him . 
  because , you know , he rebelled against the government . 
  the crackdowns , regardless how you feel about them , were a response to uighur terrorists murdering innocent people with machetes and bombing similarly unarmed people in tiananmen square . 
  while i 'm sure you support an independent kurdistan , most countries are not willing to surrender large swaths of land in the name of self determination . 
  you really can not under-state the power of language . 
  i 've stayed in a lot of hostels and the most `` natural '' conversations i 've had were with australians . 
  there 's just more chemistry there . 
  i take it articles to nouns have some sort of logical organization in dutch ? 
  do n't move the hat !, 
  the lizardmen will see you !, 
  i do n't know about the uk , but if you get dishonorably discharged from the us military it fucks up your life most savagely . 
  it 's basically like a dui ( drunk driving ) on your job applications . 
  i think that 's more in the `` things that really suck '' category . 
  not sure what that has to do with your relations with russia . 
  lol yes you do . 
  you 're in nato . 
  a founding member , no less . 
  norway is in an alliance that exists to curb russian influence on europe . 
  what do you think russia thinks about that ? 
  [ some background , not all of the background ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/mali-crisis-peacekeepers-killed-gao-attacks-160601043032404.html ) .

  pointless . 
  with a refugee crisis , more rampant terrorism , and a major market/military power leaving the eu , i think most of your leaders are probably not looking to add `` sanctions against a major trading partner '' to the list . 
   now that they are out , the usa will not screw their relationship with the # 1 economy in the world for them . 
  they are alone , and scared af .
