  he 's under the impression ( probably from reading polls ) that people hate america . 
  not for no reason , but still . 
  i mean , we 're sitting in the ~ 60 % range with one of our largest allies . 
  [ vietnam has higher approval ratings of the usa than many of our allies , lol . ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/global-opposition-to-u-s-surveillance-and-drones-but-limited-harm-to-americas-image/pg-2014-07-14-balance-of-power-1-02/ ) . 
  some people do n't understand why we 're in bed with people that hate us and think we 're an evil empire . 
  european resentment breeds some resentment on our end too . 
  not with me , but with some people . 
  `` brb forgot guns '', 
  send them reinforcements ? 
  i kid , i kid . 
  we just had an american named douglas mcarthur mccain die fighting for isis . 
  truth is stranger than fiction , what a ` murican name !, 
  this again ? 
  the us 's entire world-wide power structure is built on security guarantees . 
  plus you guys answered an article 5 for us in 2001 . 
  i do n't know why the dickless nature of * some * of your allies is always projected on us but whatever . 
  we 'd do it , if nothing but for selfish reasons . 
  if we did n't protect eesti/poland , japan and south korea would probably break with us . 
  there 's a lot at stake for the us . 
  we did n't come into our little empire by capturing these countries and making them vassals . 
  we 're there with their permission and such a thing is * always * revokable . 
  the eu may not be showing its best light right now , but you 're in nato . 
  putin 's a class a asshole , but he 's not a mindless simpleton . 
  putin 's in ukraine because ukraine is non-aligned and they 're easy to make an example of . 
  look at china and vietnam ; vietnam has no powerful friends in asia , so they get the worst of it . 
  unlike japan and the philippines , they do n't have a strongman in their ring anymore . 
   i 'm extremely pro-western and ** somewhat anti-russia **  annihilation is the only solution , not for the improvement of our world now , but for that of our descendants , so they may live in a world free of the russian . 
  it 's not unique to russia . 
  china could probably invade and annex vietnam and escape with maybe light sanctions of inconsequential value . 
  kick ourselves in the nuts over vietnam ? 
  unlikely . 
  virtually * nothing * happened to the us and uk over iraq for pretty much the same reason . 
  big powers play by different rules , especially when it 's inconvenient to take a stand . 
  fuck ya 'll i 'm making gouda in the usa !, 
  he could probably say to her : `` they 're in ukraine to punish them for wanting eu membership . 
  we 're invading them . 
  have you met my new tibetan mastiff ? 
  his name 's rasputin . '', 
  no need to lie anymore . 
  no one 's going to do anything . 
  especially not mutti . 
  you can stop at the `` witness taking a picture of putin taking a picture '' as long as you run a background check ( by an accredited non-western agency ) and prove that they are not a secret nazigay . 
  the link works for me ... too bad , because the page not found thing made me laugh . 
  this is actually my first time seeing a map like that . 
  the map i ( tried to ) link has north and south america on the leftmost part of the page . 
  fellow americans : wtf , have you used this in school ? 
  or is this canadian-commie propaganda ? 
  we 're learning slowly . 
  once we start raining bombs down on someone , we see pictures of the maps !, 
  joking aside , we learn states and capitals and the order of all of the us presidents/vice presidents by the 4th grade . 
  since such information is rarely important in day to day life , it 's easy to forget as bad as it sounds . 
  even educated people . 
  re : the map , i have n't seen anything like that . 
  we usually use one laid out like [ this ] ( http://geology.com/world/world-map.gif ) . 
  i think most americans would do pretty well until we got to the northeastern clusterfuck . 
  admittedly , i could probably only identify half of them correctly . 
  not joining nato did n't help ukraine . 
   there 's also a landslide of other issues with nato ( defence becomes reliant on us , having increase defence spendings to match their criterias , costs for switching to ammunition and systems which nato uses etc. ), 
  but they 're not as important . 
  you completely contradicted yourself in a single sentence . 
  joining nato makes you `` reliant on us defense '' but somehow the piddleshit 2 % of gdp military expenditure is excessive ? 
  the only excuse i think makes any sense is that you have economic relationships with russia and you 're afraid of putin behaving like a hun should you make any moves to defensively strengthen yourself . 
  kazakh : `` already something awkward at the photo op . 
  going to be a long day . '', 
  `` wait , we 're not in iraq ? 
  i thought those isis flags looked a little weird . 
  coordinates were * way off * '', 
  what a fucking nightmare . 
  i hope the family is at least provided for . 
  obama elected ? 
  ... i 'd rather live in britain than mississippi . 
  like , anywhere in britain . 
  maybe even under a bridge on a bed of used needles . 
  i ca n't think of one redeeming feature about mississippi other than it 's kind of close to new orleans , la. 
  this article 's kind of silly . 
  there 's no way britain is poorer than the asshole of the us . 
  i thought most people around here knew that . 
  it speaks volumes about him as a person and as a politician . 
  i recognize your position of level-headed diplomacy , but i think it 's misplaced with a man * like that * . 
  for those reading ( and the random dude who downvoted doctomoe ) , i just accused her of kowtowing to putin etc. 
  it was a little too `` aggro '' so i deleted most of the comment . 
  lol definitely not . 
  [ us favorability ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/global-opposition-to-u-s-surveillance-and-drones-but-limited-harm-to-americas-image/pg-2014-07-14-balance-of-power-1-02/ ) . 
  we 're not very popular anywhere ( except philippines ) but we 're pretty reliably on muslim countries ' shit list . 
  [ putin diplomacy ] ( http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2010/05/06/2010050600481_1.jpg ), 
  `` do n't worry , it 's not illegal food . 
  it 's weapons and soldiers ! '', 
  i do n't agree with merkel 's entire approach to this conflict but she did n't say anything wrong in the article . 
  i do n't know what 's wrong with respecting the [ decision ] ( http://www.thenation.com/sites/default/files/kiev_protest_rtr_img_3.jpg ) of the ukrainian people, 
  the headline is really , really editorialized . 
  what she said was that the ukraine is `` free to go to eurasian union '' as in she will not coerce them into the eu . 
  she also said ukrainian nato membership is not being discussed at the summit being held . 
  honestly she said a bunch of empty bullshit . 
  the only thing she 's effectively said is that she 's not opposing russia or getting into a tug-o-war over ukrainian influence , which is no surprise to fucking anyone , anywhere . 
  but if we 're going to shit on merkel 's position in this conflict , we can do it over shit she 's actually said , not things implied by headlines of articles no one reads . 
  you guys did n't like us much when we did it ... 
   going too much towards either side will bring their politicians a good amount of criticism so they choose the middle ground and look away if either side pisses on our or their feet what other side ? 
  we 're talking about * your allies * in the baltic . 
  your feelings for the united states should n't affect your feelings for the nations asking for nato assurances . 
  nato is n't a synonym for the usa , at least , it 's not supposed to be ( gib monies ) .
