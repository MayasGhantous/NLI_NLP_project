  how would it make their lives better ? 
  are you going to tax the shit out of wealthy countries to develop the poor ones ? 
  i doubt anyone would be okay with that . 
  people talk about military security . 
  whose military would it be anyway ? 
  would some countries continue to contribute a pittance to the federal forces like the currently do ? 
  if war breaks out , is it mainly british and french blood that spills ? 
  i agree . 
  poland would be stupid to not have spies in western europe and the usa . 
  our word to defend you if putin gets gropey just is n't enough . 
  a completely transparent relationship is a pipe dream . 
  even if we * did n't * have the inkling to defend you , we 'd still say it publicly to win your hearts and minds . 
  i 'd say poland and the usa have a very good relationship but you ca n't just rely on the goodwill of others . 
  historically , in your case . 
  stewart gets too preachy . 
  i preferred the colbert report , mainly because those preachy messages were coated with a layer of silly satire . 
  i liked jon stewart during the bush years , mainly because i was in high school/college and therefore really plugged into anything that was liberal and hard-hitting . 
  now i 'm really not in the mood for some middle aged guy telling me why he 's angry . 
  i 'm probably whacking a hornet 's nest , but fuck it . 
  some of these things are a matter of perspective . 
  i do n't sympathize with the russian position on the current crisis ... at all ... but some people view the conflict like this : `` people felt that the coup overrode the democratic process and they feel their voices were ignored . 
  people who identify as russians were suddenly made strangers in their own country . 
  so what they do is rebel against the government coup to take control over their own lands and join the team they agree with . '', 
  some people view the `` dpr '' as people resisting fascism . 
  i do n't agree with it , because i view it the way the west has framed it . 
  whenever some group arises in armed rebellion ( especially with support from external powers ) it will create a divisive issue . 
  basically : of course / r/russia is completely on board . 
  look at / r/europe for fuck 's sake , it 's really not much different here . 
  we just view our information as correct , and their information as insane propaganda . 
   would be nice though if we could reach a point where we are comfortable enough and trust each other enough such that the spy games can be stopped , at least within nato . 
  anglobros have the 5 eyes , which merkel rejected . 
  i think in today 's world , that 's the closest you can get to `` stopping the spy games between countries . '', 
  i 'm not sure i agree that nato nations should n't spy on each other . 
  for example , it would be awesome for a country like poland to know whether or not the us or france actually intends on backing them up . 
  we would * never * volunteer the truth if the answer was `` no '' because it would weaken our position in poland . 
  lol , eu is nazi american puppet confirmed . 
  rt should put this as their banner . 
  i was against the iraq war from start to finish ... but really , fuck isis . 
  i know it 's kind of a propaganda piece , but i watched a cnn piece on the refugees who fled their homes and did n't know ( at first ) if their dad made it out . 
  they were in hiding . 
  there was also a demonstration begging the west to save them from isis . 
  i guess it 's because my country caused the instability in the first place , but we need to do something . 
  i certainly would n't lose any sleep if al-baghdadi was killed in a drone strike . 
  i like # 3 . 
  makes it feel command and conquer-y . 
  [ heh , is n't there already a way to get / r/europe without fun little posts like the ones you mentioned ? 
  that appears to be what they 're advising people to do . 
  ca n't tell if legitimately crazy islamic radical , or subtly trying to get those people to leave the country . 
  either propaganda or absolute genius . 
  `` advise the khaleef if he does anything wrong . '', 
  so ... get the crazies to move there , then get them executed ? 
  kill your feelings ? 
  if germany can make nazi membership and even doodling nazi symbology illegal , i do n't see why they ca n't make it a criminal offense to go full allahu-snackbar and support isis . 
  seriously , throw these animals in a cage where they belong . 
  you ca n't just deport german-born muslim idiots for their beliefs , but you * can * treat them like german born nazis . 
  maybe he 'll send all the food that was banned in russia and taken off the shelves lol, 
  and the jews orchestrated everything , right ? 
  it really does n't imply false . 
  leading up to the war with iraq we aired a lot of stuff about saddam 's gassing of the kurds . 
  should we have aired both sides of that story ? 
  was it false because we did n't air the pro-bath version too ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's unavoidable to show a bias unless you do , though . 
  when i say `` propaganda '' i mean the narrative would absolutely be pro-intervention . 
  the word is mostly used pejoratively in most discussions but biases kind of create the environment for it . 
  there are many instances where propaganda drives the narrative , simply because of the values of the people telling it . 
  think of crimea . 
  if he invaded estonia , the propaganda machine here would be in full swing showing pictures like [ this from afghanistan ] ( http://img.defencetalk.com/pictures/data/3185/medium/aaa_sized.jpg ) . 
  this is all puffery anyway . 
  russia will never touch a nato member . 
  this would be absolutely crazy on mushrooms . 
  [ god save the king !!!!,

  your goddamn highway speed limit of 100 kmh , that 's what . 
  and how expensive your booze is , what the fuck ? 
  are we neighbors ? 
  i hate one thing about canada and canadians : the condescending attitude and the simultaneous `` oh our country is doing something i do n't like and it 's america 's fault '' blame-shifting . 
  it 's like ingrained in your blood or something . 
  that aside : favorite neighbor is canada ( we 're hockeybros and hockeyfoes ) . 
  judging by their backgrounds , i 'm guessing both of these guys will die in this war . 
  i 'd love to see st. petersburg and whatnot but this situation has made me strike russia off the travel docket , at least for now . 
  i still have a lot of places i want to see , there 's no reason to select somewhere politically volatile . 
  [ here you go sir , fuck you very much ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2cuy6n/more_russians_than_ever_think_their_country_is/cjjsa8h ) . 
  chinese produce is dirt fucking cheap unless you want cherries or something . 
  i wonder if he realizes that the alternative to putin is the communist party . 
  those guys sure were great ... let 's bring them back !, 
  i 'm sure their foreign policy is benign and peaceful . 
  my country 's political system is broken too . 
  cheer up , tovarisch , not everyone hates russians . 
  are you from luxembourg/greenland/liechtenstein or something ? 
  where do you come from where your vote carries a good deal of weight ? 
  how do you know how these people voted ? 
  what does `` pro-palestine '' even mean ? 
  how can you be pro-palestine without adopting positions of hamas ? 
  do you just disagree with hamas ' methods of winning the pr war ? 
  the `` pro-palestinian '' narrative is basically the demands put forth by hamas ( two state , surrender of jerusalem , right of return , end of the blockade , etc ) . 
  some people even adopt the `` one palestine , remove israel '' position . 
  so really , what part of hamas do pro-palestine people disagree with ? 
  the tactics ? 
  i 'm not trying to be a dick , i 'm genuinely curious as a person who is n't personally `` attached '' to the conflict .
