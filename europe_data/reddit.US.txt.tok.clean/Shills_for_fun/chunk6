  i 'd argue it 's most definitely intended to be racist . 
  kind of like saying `` barack hussein obama '' all the time when discussing him . 
  that is indeed barack obama 's full name , but the intentional emphasis on `` hussein '' is meant to be subtly pejorative . 
  * sigh * click the link for the article and spare yourself the outrage . 
  unless those [ algerians in paris ] ( http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/02/world/antisemitism/antisemitism-master675.jpg ) are getting into buddhism or something and the italians who wrote `` torch the synagogues/jews your end is near '' somehow made a grievous mistranslation somewhere , i 'd say there are definitely many recent acts of * anti-semitism * . 
  the article lists several . 
  if you disagree that anti-semitism is on the rise and that the article is cherry-picking , that 's your call . 
  however , you 're probably getting `` downvotes '' ( you 're +3 at the time of my post ) because your outrage is completely misdirected and has nothing to do with the article , and seemingly nothing to do with a particular comment . 
   you have set your bar for leaping into conspiracy theory mode significantly low . 
  the bar was set low long ago , dude . 
  even here . 
  everyone pro-russia on reddit is a paid government shill . 
  if you do n't side against china on every issue , you 're wumaodang . 
  ^ and ^ yes ^ i 'm ^ aware ^ of ^ the ^ relevance ^ of ^ my ^ username ^ to ^ this ^ post, 
  1 ) never been , but i 'd like to go . 
  it seems like a great country run by shitty people . 
  we know a bit about that problem ourselves . 
  2 ) turks are very warm-hearted people . 
  my sample is limited to turkish grad students in america but they 're all great people . 
  turkish food is awesome , and their desserts are a special kind of delicious . 
  3 ) i 'm not european so i do n't have any opinion on turkey 's admission to the eu . 
  i think urban , educated turks have a lot in common with urban , educated westerners so i think the cultural barriers are exaggerated . 
  unfortunately i notice the opinion of turks held by some europeans is soured by the `` local turks '' who are mostly uneducated and chav-y . 
  5 ) i do n't know that much about atat\u00fcrk other than the fact that he 's the founder of the country , and he encouraged secularism . 
  the turkish people i know talk him up a lot and i trust in their judgment , so i 'd say positive . 
  it 's a sad state of affairs in western countries when you need to ban terrorist flags to prevent your `` citizens '' from proudly waving them around . 
  it 's not even whataboutism . 
  floodle 's basically pretending that you ca n't say `` fuck le amerikkka le worst cuntry in le world '' anonymously on the internet in some shitty blog without the fbi pulling up in a surveillance van . 
  if america 's police state was as bad as people often say it is , i think reddit would be a bit * smaller * . 
  if a country feels they do n't need to invest into their military , they should n't be a part of nato and we should n't force them to militarize . 
  most of europe is in no danger of being attacked by a foreign power . 
  i think nato served its purpose and should disband at this point . 
  let military alliances in europe form naturally . 
  although i personally dislike putin and his government 's disgusting actions in ukraine , it 's sort of backward at this point for the us to go toe-to-toe with russia on issues that are frankly none of our business . 
  i 'm from michigan . 
  dearborn muslims are mostly american , and the ones who are n't are definitely trying their best to change that . 
  generally speaking , the fob immigrants are probably the most patriotic people in our country , so you might want to keep that `` non-american city '' opinion to yourself in front of them . 
  [ some german soldiers did the same thing in afghanistan . 
  war brings the worst out of people . 
  ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2006/world/europe/10/25/germany.afghan/ ), 
  bourbon ? 
  michigan . 
  beer : the region i 'm from has a lot of great breweries . 
  i like ipas if they 're done right . 
  whiskey : i 'm mostly a bourbon guy but i enjoy the irish whiskeys as well . 
  my `` i do n't feel like breaking the bank drink '' is gin and tonic . 
  i ca n't stomach bad whiskey or beer . 
  america assimilated the gypsies so maybe we ` re an extreme comparison . 
  i do n't disagree with you , but it 's really funny coming from a brit . 
  the united states and the united kingdom war together , spy together , and talk shit together whenever another country does something we do n't like . 
  foreign policy wise , we 're the mean girls . 
  if the uk and us used each other as a basis for comparison it would be an echo chamber . 
  doubt it , but if the pro-fedeu people push the federalism button too hard against the wills and interests of a good number of people , nothing is impossible . 
  edit : wrote pro-euro instead of pro-federal eu , still not sure why . 
   and how all this started over protests about a trade deal faceoff between the eu america and russia and they were totally waving american flags and not eu ones on the barricades of the maidan ... oh . 
  wait . 
  i was going to say `` wow we sure are generous with our coups these days . '', 
  sometimes russian propaganda reaches north korea levels of revisionism it 's hard to separate the real propaganda from the satire . 
   by protesting israel with savage anti-semitic violence , they do nothing but make a case for the need of a safe haven such as israel for jews i 'm not sure why this is even negotiable . 
  there are no shortage of israelis who were born in israel and have no `` home '' outside of israel . 
  regardless of your feelings on the original logic of establishing the state , it can not be undone in any morally justifiable manner . 
  that said , i do n't agree with israel 's actions and i think the palestinians in refugee camps deserve a nation to call home . 
   3rd generation young immigrants who are being twisted by radicals . 
  let 's not pretend they were indoctrinated by some nefarious force . 
  anti-semitism exists in their families . 
  it has for generations . 
  as to the football stuff , racism is a major problem not limited to stupid-ass ghetto-looking turkish hoodlums . 
  no one in the us hates the french . 
  the `` freedom fries '' shit was a media circus during the misinformation period of the iraq war . 
  i did n't see any anti-france stuff outside of the news . 
  i think , more recently , france is portrayed by our media as one of the few countries with the balls to confront armed islamic extremists . 
  only 4/10 for making you write that wall of text ? 
  haha . 
  he 's mistaken , clearly . 
  after we invented creationism , we created the reptilians , who did all of that horrible shit . 
  / u/americanwayofdeath is truly a master of his craft . 
  but he 's mistaken . 
  it 's not the americans in charge , it 's the lizard lord illuminjewdi . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'd love to see them have their own state , but i do n't think we 'll live to see the day where they peacefully decide what that state looks like . 
  on both sides there is no shortage of people with so much hate in their hearts that the only acceptable solution is the complete annihilation of the other group . 
  actually , in us history , we answered the `` federalism '' question by killing each other in a sad , bloody civil war . 
  actually , this is one of the ** best ** situations to remain restrained and level-headed . 
  what 's ukraine to you ? 
  seriously ? 
  i know it sucks that a country is slowly getting devoured by a larger power who , comically , denies any involvement . 
  however , europe did * nothing * to the us and uk when we tricked you into invading iraq . 
  why would you do something to russia ? 
  i think the only europeans who view putin as a threat are people in the baltics and poland . 
  western europe sees putin and smells euros . 
  when it gets down to brass tacks , ukraine is neither a military ally ( nato ) nor an economic/political ally ( eu ) . 
  no need for polish/european blood . 
  putin * is * untouchable . 
  `` the us would drag europe into another one of its wars !, 
  they 'll invoke article 6 again !, 
  attacking putin is not in our interests ( muh gas lines ) , fuck the usa ! '', 
  not saying everyone would hold this opinion , but we 've been * extra * unpopular lately . 
  uk , us , and aus having a conversation ? 
  honestly ? 
  military . 
  hit the rebels if we have to do something .
