  ** to a man ** the racist dickholes all live in the suburbs or countryside , where they do n't actually interact with any immigrants on a daily basis , and form their opinions based off of hearsay and conjectures rather than basing them off of any prolonged , direct experience . 
  what is this sensationalist garbage ? 
  the editing is like an american 's parody of an ultra-paranoid racist idiot . 
  i was actually laughing out loud at how completely mundane his `` problems '' were with public transit . 
  i am trying to find the paper i read ; it 's from a local linguist whose background is in sanskrit literature . 
  i will definitely edit with a link to it once i find it !, 
  could n't agree more on the `` shitty pseudoscience '' part - but the words she singled out do indeed seem * not * to be indo-european loanwords , nor did they show up as words in other obvious languages . 
  i 'm definitely not in europe , but the usa is definitely `` the west '' too , and somali immigrants are the backbone of my city 's urban renewal . 
  [ here 's a fantastic article ] ( http://www.startribune.com/inside-little-mogadishu-no-one-is-an-outcast/414876214/ ) about the neighborhood most live in ; prior to somali arrival ( in my childhood ) , it was a crumbling , broken mess of an area infested with crack addiction and gang violence . 
  now it 's wall-to-wall small businesses , and the empty lots have been turned into several parks full of the next generation of mls players . 
  oh , good to hear !, 
  native american languages usually die and disappear for good - fewer than two dozen out of several hundred are taught in curriculum . 
  the two languages in my area , [ anishinaabeg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxhsw005zce ) and [ dakota ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzsbocprxsa ) , are two of the lucky few that have serious revival efforts going on . 
  i 've mostly heard about it from a local linguist and sanskirt expert . 
  her name eludes me right now , but she teaches at the university of minnesota . 
  i 'll edit this comment again when i remember her name , and link to anything she 's posted online !, 
  another anecdote i find very interesting : vedic sanskrit has several dozen loanwords that are clearly finnic in origin , whereas no attested iranic languages do . 
  this means it 's very likely that proto-aryan started off to the * north * of proto-iranic , perhaps somewhere near modern-day kazan russia , before migrating further east and south !, 
  this map seems to support that sub-model , with the satem languages forming a broad band north of the black sea and the centum languages forming a broad band along the aegean and mediterranean . 
  heh , pami\u0119ta\u0107 is the polish verb for `` remember '' . 
  slavic cognates often come to mean completely different things ; another fun example is that the croatian word `` ponos '' means diarrhea in russian . 
  towarzysz has no slavic roots that i 'm aware of ( ` warzy ' is usually something relating to vegetables , and almost no other nouns start with `` to '' ) ; i figured it was a word from the days of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  awww ... that * really * sucks . 
  i had no idea it was extinct , much less in serious danger . 
  i started going down this rabbit hole when , upon visiting my grandmother 's ancestral village ( [ osowo le\u015bne ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/osowo_le%c5%9bne ) ) , i found to my shock that they all speak a * heavy * dialect of polish called kociewie - it 's different enough that several older residents could n't understand me when i spoke ( slow , basic ) standard polish . 
  there is even a family or two of germans who 've been there for centuries , and they had zero exposure to standard polish , as a nice older villager was `` translating '' back and forth in her heavy accent . 
  there 's very little written about kociewie even in polish scholarship , as it seems to be limited to just a handful of villages and no more than 5,000 speakers . 
  after finding out about prussian , it really looks a lot like this is a polish dialect that was influenced by it , or perhaps even polish spoken as an adopted language by original prussian speakers . 
  we do n't look a ton like stereotypical poles , either . 
  i 'm surprised by how different it is from lithuanian ; but at the same time , i can see some pretty clear examples of the differences being due to sound changes ( like in thewelyse -  d\u0117delis , eg -  jeigu , doyte -  duoti , etc ) . 
  i am not talking about the traditional view ; i am talking about the view , based on more recent research , that proto-slavic in its earliest form might have been a baltic language . 
  i 've mostly just read about it [ on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_prussian_language#relation_to_other_languages ) , but the similarity between one of the sentences on there and my grandma 's polish dialect * really * stuck out to me . 
  copied from another comment : `` kayle rekyse !, 
  is an old prussian inscription meaning `` cheers , sir !, 
  you are no longer a good little comrade if you want to drink , but do n't want to give a penny ! '', 
  written in polish orthography , it would be `` kajle , rekyse !, 
  compare to kociewiak polish , especially the last lines : `` chejl , pan !, 
  not anymore , but compare old prussian to proto-slavic and the link is clearer . 
  is an old prussian inscription meaning `` cheers , sir !, 
  you are no longer a good little comrade if you want to drink , but do n't want to give a penny ! '', 
  written in polish orthography , it would be `` kajle , rekyse !, 
  compare to kociewiak polish , especially the last lines : `` chejl , pan !, 
  what would this sentence be in lithuanian ? 
  i would love to know !, 
  as more research is being done on west baltic languages and on older slavic languages of poland and belarus , it 's looking like slavs are long-lost balts who got all kinds of foreign-influenced sound changes to lead them astray . 
  likewise , those four linguists each constructed their proofs between 1858 and 1972 . 
  until more material is found in older languages , we will have a hard time knowing exactly when and how the split occurred . 
  what seems likely to me , from my knowledge of kashubian , polish ( and its archaic kociewiak dialect ) and a bit of pomeranian , is that proto-slavic got its start as a divergent dialect of a west baltic language that later underwent several outside-influenced sound changes . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.lituanus.org/1967/67_2_01klimas.html ) seems to be the best-written go at `` disproving '' the link that i have found . 
  nearly every point it brings up is either disputable ( for example , the loss of final consonants as in `` sunus -  synu '' is a very simple sound change often seen between mere dialects ) , based off of irresponsibly using modern languages like russian as a basis of comparison , or demonstrably false . 
  most notably false to me being point 4 ; the baltic tj -  \u0107 merger forms the basis of the sound in proto-slavic and still remains in kashubian and polish ; but it further changed to \u0107 -  t/t ' in czech/slovak , rus ' , and south slavic - slavonic being a dialect of south slavic . 
  this article merely , lazily , states that it `` did n't happen '' in slavic . 
  point 8 ignores that these verbs came over to slavic after a sound change of `` inti '' to `` ikli '' ( only kashubian and slovenian still have such verbs today ) , point 9 is disproved by the existence of the proto-slavic verb root `` jiti '' ( ie , croatian `` spojiti '' , czech `` p\u0159ipojit '' ) , and point 11 is disproved by kashubian , which uses that tense extensively ( in all other slavic languages , it merged into the perfective aspect , with which it is largely interchangeable ) . 
  slavs do n't call each other that either - and the grouping is based in a plethora of shared sound changes that do n't occur anywhere else , as well as in having incredibly similar grammatical features shared nowhere else . 
  most modern slavic languages have diverged a good deal since the split , and lost their shared baltic features ; but the older ones like kashubian and slovenian still preserve most if not all of the grammar from proto-slavic , as does the very well-attested church slavonic . 
  every `` proof '' i have seen trying to disprove the balto-slavic link makes the grievous mistake of comparing modern languages ( with all of their continued innovations and changes ) , instead of comparing the attested older forms . 
  so , if you already know all this ( especially the baltic origins of proto-slavic ) , how can you possibly deny the familial relationship of the baltic and slavic families ? 
  there is about as much dispute over the balto-slavic grouping as there is dispute over the existence of anthropogenic climate change . 
  i have yet to see one person dissenting the grouping who does it from a place of verifiable research , instead of a place of misguided nationalism . 
  you really need to look at the extinct west baltic languages . 
  they are the lost link between the two modern families , and failing to take them into account would absolutely lead someone to erroneously believe that there is no connection . 
  as another example , without looking at mansi and khanty , hungarian would be the only known ugric language , and near-impossible to prove its relation to the finnic languages ( which together form the uralic family ) . 
  once you take into account the now-extinct west baltic languages , like prussian and yotvingian , the relation between baltic and slavic is extremely obvious . 
  for vocabulary , east and west baltic are in many ways further from each other than west baltic and slavic are . 
  slavic is all descended from one ( partially attested ! ), 
  language , proto-slavic , which itself was likely descended from a long-gone west baltic language , as it and old prussian had a nearly 50 % overlap in vocabulary ( old polish and yotvingian have an even larger overlap ) . 
  there are even strong arguments that thracian belonged to a long-extinct third branch of this family , but too few words of the language are attested for anyone to make a solid conclusion . 
  there are several dozen minority languages in europe that did n't make it onto this list , since they are not official languages at the eu level . 
  poland has silesian and kashubian , latvia has livonian ( another finnic language ) , and there are too many limes to hold onto once you see how many regional languages exist in spain , france , and italy . 
  it 's funny you say that , because the overwhelming majority of people in the british isles belong to [ dna haplogroup r1b ] ( http://cache.eupedia.com/images/content/haplogroup_r1b-borders.png ) , which is that of the ancient celtic tribes as well as being common among basque people . 
  ethnically english populations never have a lower occurrence rate than 50 % ( unless you go down to individual villages ) , which backs up the historical record of assimilation and intermarriage being more prevalent than bloody conquest and forced resettlement . 
  likewise , outside of cardiff , dublin and belfast , irish and welsh people are overwhelmingly of this dna type ; anywhere from 92 - 100 % depending on the village . 
  where i live , 100 miles is a nice drive on a day off . 
  some people even commute that far every day for work . 
  dude , if you 're talking djs , the best shit is all underground here too . 
  shows are advertised entirely through facebook and word-of-mouth . 
  the fact that i can look him up at all ( great shit , btw ) totally undermines your earlier snag about people who post their music online . 
  our top techno guy is definitely [ dvs1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lojsoxw6lay ) - he has since moved to berlin , but still does late-night sets at least twice a year back home . 
  how the actual fuck do you expect to * get * an audience without giving people the opportunity to hear your music ? 
  `` if you do n't take thursday night off of work and just happen to go into local dive bar # 42 , go fuck yourself , we do n't want you '' ? 
  `` hey , listen to my music . '', 
  `` how '' ? 
  `` uhhhhh ... '', 
  you 're clearly not a punk - apart from having bandcamp or soundcloud pages , our entire punk scene tends to happen in basements , safe spaces , and the occasional dive bar . 
  [ flesh panthers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luqbaumy8s8 ) is a group i still try to follow , after seeing them tear the house down inside of some random bar in chicago years ago . 
  the best unsung hero in my own city is probably a band called [ all the pretty horses ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv1jiunrv_s ) , and their amazing frontwoman , [ venus de mars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llb5y90ffr4 ) . 
  no underground or indie music in the us ? 
  you are obstinately , irredeemably full of shit . 
  oh fuck ... you lived in miami , san fran , * and * la ? 
  this explains pretty much everything , they are all truly devoid of any distinct cultural hallmarks whatsoever ( other than the ones that immigrants import ) . 
  la at least has cholo/chola culture and miami 's cuban community is cool , but that 's about it really . 
  cities with real special things going for them are chicago , boston , washington dc , nyc , savannah , new orleans , memphis , portland , denver , even my own minneapolis to an extent ( certainly moreso than the inside-out starbucks that is san francisco ) . 
  i 'm not trying to do mental gymnastics , i 'm trying to get you to realize that america as a whole is the polar opposite of monocultural . 
  if you really want monocultural , spend a month or two in kansas ( without leaving for any other state ) , poland , hungary , japan , or north korea . 
  i disagree because 1/4th of my neighbors are immigrants , and of the remaining 3/4ths , there are enormous splits along lines of politics ( which , here , is essentially a split among the different rural/urban cultures ) and especially along lines of race and income . 
  returning from europe , i keenly missed `` american culture '' , and it was the first time in my life i could truly say what it was exactly that i like about american culture - talking to friendly strangers often and loudly , smiling often , bouncing around wildly different personal beliefs and opinions , and having a rock-solid personal definition of social justice ( regardless of politics , hence our loud arguments ) . 
  as to the music thing - did you even * try * going to smaller shows , events , and venues ? 
  or am i just more spoiled by the good music scene in minneapolis than i can ever realize ? 
   its not about having climate types , were i live now you see snow , desert , plains , beaches , all within an hour or so of each other . 
  oh , you 're not in europe either ?
