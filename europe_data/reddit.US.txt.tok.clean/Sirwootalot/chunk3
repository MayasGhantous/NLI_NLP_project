  by the deserts and snow comment , it 's got ta be either south america , turkey , the caucasus , or north africa , right ? 
  i 'd have guessed socal if it was n't for your incomprehensibly vast ignorance about the diversity present in the usa . 
   but again what is tourism to you ? 
  looking at a climate type and that 's it ? 
  nope - tourism to me is experiencing different cultures , cuisines , and art/architecture , as well as climate . 
  when i visit poland , the climate is functionally identical to where i live now . 
   it is a beautiful country , it has a lot to see , but its frankly the most boring country to visit on earth imo . 
  try to avoid canada , kyrgyzstan , brunei , kuwait , the uae , and western sahara if you do n't want this spot to be taken . 
   what do you consider a different culture ? 
  cultures differ when a people 's common ground is outweighed by their differences in diet , religion , values , music , myths and legends , dialect/language , and any number of things . 
  the variety * within * american culture is the greatest of any one culture on earth , bar none ( regardless of how appealing that base culture may be to someone else ) . 
  the several hundred camps of music subcultures alone ; the vegans , the vegetarians ; the old hippies , new hippies , new-agers and spoiled ravers ; bikers , bicyclists , and bike-riders ; rockstars , rock climbers , rock-smokers . 
  * on top of all of this * usual variation you have ( literally ! ), 
  every single nationality on earth represented in immigrant communities , cultural organizations , diasporas , `` do n't know do n't care '' whites , and every mix thereof ; destitute poverty on par with moldova all the way to the most unfathomably wealthy humans in world history ; or , to put it in a more trite way , a melting pot . 
  nearly every other nationality on earth is inextricably tied to a single specific culture . 
  americans are some of the very few that can truly be whoever the fuck they want - believe whatever , love whoever , do whatever , live whichever way - and still get to be called american on top of it all . 
  that 's just about the * only * thing tying it all together . 
  it 's not easy for europeans to visit the most unique parts of the usa , since they are * very * rural and isolated , but there are `` colonies '' of amish , mennonites and anabaptists who have no phones , electricity , or plumbing ( or very , very little ) and still live on subsistence farms in places like minnesota , nebraska , texas , and pennsylvania . 
  also , our larger , more culturally intact [ native reservations ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvyl9iv1ahy ) tend to resemble kyrgyzstan in development/infrastructure level . 
  the only wealthy tribes tend to be ones who no longer use their native languages at home , and do n't stir `` trouble '' with state governments over that whole pesky sovereignty thing . 
  definitely true , i do n't know who 's dense enough to downvote you . 
  america has all kinds of micro-cultures ( for lack of a better term ) that are like small nations unto themselves , especially our native peoples and our religious exclaves - but it 's got nothing on something like the 6-hour drive from krak\u00f3w to venice , passing through slovakia , hungary , and slovenia on the way !, 
  `` europeans think 100 miles is a really long distance , and americans think 100 years is a really long time ago '' . 
  you 're on even shakier ground than before . 
  the usa is one of only four countries on earth with more than 10 [ koppen climate types ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/world_koppen_classification_%28with_authors%29.svg ) - the others being canada , china , and russia . 
  texas * alone * has more unique plant and insect species than the entirety of cisalpine europe does , and states like north carolina , california , and washington have more rare microclimates than most * nations * do . 
  the east coast is pretty monocultural , as are the midwest and the rust belt , but when you get anywhere further south or west the usa is insanely diverse in * every way possible * , and yes that includes [ language ] ( https://www.languagetrainers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/carteusa.png ) too ( even if we have nothing on bessarabia or istria ) . 
  just yes , do n't make * yourself * sound retarded . 
  you ever been to navajo country , or to a mormon exclave in bumfuck-nowhere utah , or a mennonite colony in texas ? 
  hell , even cajun country , the northwoods , a large res town , or chicago 's chinatown ? 
  the vast majority of the population still speaks standard serbian , but montenegrin is as close to it as a new york accent is to a boston accent . 
  germany 's a little busy leading the world on fusion power research . 
  poland is super windy , especially on the baltic - you guys could have 10x as many wind farms and still barely be scratching the surface of your potential . 
  there is a ton of potential for fracking , but i do n't trust the current government one whit to do it safely or responsibly . 
  solar power in gda\u0144sk would be about as useful as hydroelectric in mecca . 
  with all these other minority languages listed , t 's a same they skipped [ kashubian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kashubian_language ) - it 's an incredibly fascinating and incredibly archaic language , possibly the most archaic slavic language still in use today . 
  it has the highest overlap with baltic languages , as well as several loanwords from old saxon dialects of german . 
  man , i have been to both , and it is astounding how much nicer small towns in poland are than the ones in russia . 
  i have family in starogard gda\u0144sk region , and have stayed in rural parts of podhale and kujawy as well . 
  you go even a little bit outside of central kaliningrad and it looks like \u0141\u00f3d\u017a did in the early 90s - everything is crumbling , the sidewalks are shit , potholes everywhere . 
  warsaw is kind of shitty when compared to gda\u0144sk , toru\u0144 , bydgoszcz , and krak\u00f3w , but all five are way better off than kaliningrad - and everyone says kaliningrad is russia 's wealthiest region !, 
  hungary 's far-right are literally fascists ; like , `` death penalty for queers and non-christians '' level fascists . 
  i only know a few croatian-americans ( pot-smoking hippies * to a man * ) , and they 're all from the coast . 
  that 's easy to say from croatia , y' all are laid-back party animals compared to the cuckoos in poland and hungary 's far-right . 
  that 's what i 'm saying - they desperately need to `` get cool '' by investing in attracting foreign workers . 
  their it sector is doing well , but every other major business is n't even trying to think big . 
  i looked into working in sporting arenas while i was in gda\u0144sk and krak\u00f3w , and on the operations side , they are seriously at least 25 years behind the usa , uk , and germany . 
  they have nice modern facilities , but are doing hardly anything with the space . 
  yep , and since i only heard 400,000 come up in personal covnersations , i 'm definitely going to go with your correction . 
  yay facts !, 
  [ europe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xz2hvjb.jpg ) vs [ usa ] ( http://calorielab.com/news/wp-images/post-images/fattest-states-2015-big.jpg ), 
  holy cats , that * is * a lot - i was there in october , and was told it was only 400,000 . 
  it must be an old number !, 
  or maybe it 's 400,000 out of that 1.3 million who were born in the ukraine , and the rest are 2nd or 3rd generation ? 
  i 'm sure that 's not right , just guessing though ... 
  i have only been to vienna , munich , a bit of slovakia , and over half of poland , but here goes : - do you all pee banana-yellow ? 
  seriously , it is stupidly hard to drink a decent amount of water per day when traveling in europe . 
  ordering water at restaurants gets you a puny , tiny 200 ml glass with a plastic bottle poured into it - that you have to pay for !, 
  it blew my mind when i found out that the city 's tapwater was completely fine tasting , * in every damn city i went to * . 
  in the usa , when you ask for water , you get a pint or so , constant refills , and it 's always completely free . 
  - in three different hotels/hostels in poland , there were butt-naked dudes walking around the place without a care in the world . 
  a couple i saw in zakopane had a child that looked to be 2 years old running around completely bare-naked , and this was on a busy-ish shopping street . 
  in the usa , public nudity is almost always a misdemeanor or crime , and if someone saw a naked * child * running around , the police would be called . 
  - holy shit poland , you damn near killed me with how much vodka you put away in a night 's partying . 
  `` you are funny , i will buy you shots '' , followed by a whole freaking * plate * of shotglasses just for me , is something that happened several times . 
  - all over , but especially in poland and slovakia , your beds are hard as fuck . 
  `` the softest bed in the world '' ended up being slightly nicer than the hardest american bed i 've ever slept in . 
  the hardest bed , in slovakia , felt like a concrete slab with blankets laid over it . 
  - and the biggest shock of all - you guys are all in * really * good physical shape . 
  in vienna there was a near-swarm of muscly young men and women jogging through the stadtpark , and not a single overweight human in sight ( same goes for my very brief time in munich ) . 
  the fattest pole in poland would still be one of the skinniest people in a room full of polish-americans , to the point that i was half-expecting to see a bunch of short , stocky , beer-bellied old guys everywhere in the country because i just thought that 's what the stereotypical pole looked like ( my polish family are all short and super-skinny , but we stick out like sore thumbs at polish cultural events in the area ) . 
  instead , while plenty of older people are chubby , the vast majority of young people i saw looked like they spend an hour or more at the gym every day . 
  nearly a third of my friends have some kind of physical limitations here at home , but in poland , i do n't think i saw a single obese person under the age of 40 . 
  hey , poland !, 
  do you want thriving , booming urban populations , a globally connected economy , and more international investment ? 
  try * immigration * !, 
  seriously , the entire nation of poland has fewer immigrants than just my lone metropolitan area in the usa . 
  as a percentage of the population , it 's something like 0.4 % , compared to my city being 18 % immigrants . 
  london is 37 % immigrants , and miami is 39 % !, 
  the overwhelming majority of immigrants in poland are from ukraine , at something like 70 or 75 % of the foreign-born population . 
  my city has disproved the misconception that immigrants bring crime ; and proves that * marginalizing minorities * is what brings crime , be that from reduced educational and business opportunities , ignoring gross economic inequality , or staunch outside discrimination . 
  sweden is a failure because they bring people over , but then do n't do a damn thing to integrate them into swedish society ; not because of the national origin of those immigrants . 
  gang territory in the usa does n't work because there are zero available decent jobs and next to zero quality education ; not because of ethnicity . 
  polska strongk , remove kebap , etc etc is all self-defeating nonsense , especially when there are people who want to come in that are perfectly willing to assimilate into polish society . 
  you do n't move to a place as patriotic , distinct , and nationalistic as poland unless you * want to be a pole * , period end , and i strongly feel like the current government is slamming the door in people 's faces so hard that they 're breaking noses . 
  good on you guys for having a strict language requirement for citizenship ; but polish is absurdly difficult to learn , to the point that that 's likely the main filter you need to keep out people who are n't serious about making poland a better place to live for everyone . 
  you can not learn polish without also learning what it means to be a pole - it 's utterly astounding how much of the culture is locked up and intertwined within the language itself , and i can think of no other comparable languages anywhere in europe . 
  no , not even remotely close , if you 're talking geographic area . 
  city divisions are * weird * . 
  sitka , alaska is almost half the size of wales , despite having 1/10th the population of the isle of mann , and the city of chongqing covers a land area nearly twice the size of * england * . 
  if you 're talking population , london is either the 23rd largest metropolitan area , 22nd largest city proper , or the 32nd largest urban area . 
  sorry to be pedantic , but since the usa has 231,556,622 million eligible voters , it 's actually 27.2 % that voted for him . 
  28.44 % voted for hillary , 4.4 % voted third party , and ** 40 % did n't vote at all . 
  ** turnout varies wildly state to state , but there is a very interesting correllation - blue states tend to have much higher turnout than red ones . 
  dude , he probably loves children a bit too much . 
  if i was n't crunched for time i 'd show you a couple of videos of how very , very weird he is around little kids ... 
  god damnit , i wish you were n't right . 
  i 'm a bit weird and feel like volhynia has more in common with central europe than it does with eastern europe , but i know that 's not a common view . 
  i made [ the shittiest ms paint maps in human history ] ( https://imgur.com/a/64mqw ) to illustrate how i 've always viewed europe , vs. how most americans view europe . 
  poland is a destination for outsourcing , and has a bad population crunch / very low unemployment .
