  until polish companies start also outsourcing and intergrating poland 's economy more tightly with other countries , they will continue only to get trickle-down wealth from elsewhere instead of truly booming . 
  poland is like this too - its internal purchasing power is better than even the usa 's , and the ability of the poor to afford healthy food every day is astronomically higher than in the usa . 
  it 's the shitty , broken exchange rate that makes its gdp so low . 
  europe 's eastern border is the ural mountains , and `` eastern europe '' starts at the borders of belarus and ukraine - so the donbass is a bit south , but otherwise it 's nearly dead-center of `` eastern europe '' . 
  it 's such an inaccurate portrayal , we all know he 's actually mussolini reincarnate . 
   when you do n't count ... or ... . 
  precisely , because among somali men that are 25 and older , employment statistics are completely normal . 
  as for somali women that are unmarried , they have a * lower * unemployment rate than other low-income women in minneapolis . 
  i bring up income level because this is by far the greatest dividing factor in american employment statistics ( for example , the `` asians make more money '' myth flies out the window when you see that asians in poor neighborhoods are just as poor as their neighbors , rather than an outlier - whereas the extent to which they are more educated than other racial groups is exactly the same as the extent to which they have a higher average income ) . 
   the biggest threat somalis pose is only a threat when  dunno dude , those guys joining jihad seem kinda dangerous did you literally not read my comment ? 
  please do so again , and you 'll see that i outlined exactly what it is that makes 8 people a year want to join jihad . 
  please set your agenda down for a bit , your arms must be so very tired . 
  if you actually care for the truth , you 'd have no problem reading a whole comment , or doing original research with [ widely-available data . 
  ] ( http://www.city-data.com/income/income-minneapolis-minnesota.html ), 
  when you adjust for income , unmarried somalis in minneapolis have the exact same unemployment rate as people of the same income level in the city . 
  the statistics are highly skewed due to the prevalence of more traditional women who stay at home after marriage , as well as a lower employment rate among adolescent men ( 18-24 ) . 
  the exact same thing happened with the hmong population in the 1980s ( down to the gender gap ) , and it leveled out around when i was growing up , in the mid-late 2000s . 
  give it time . 
  the biggest threat somalis pose is only a threat when their neighbors are dickbags who do n't accept them into the rest of society , or when maladjusted weirdos try to find something that 'll make everyone else take them seriously ( it 's literally the exact same psychology as white adolescent school shooters ) . 
  i even briefly worked with one of the guys isis tried and failed to recruit , abdullah ( abdi ) yusuf , back at a lame summer job in 2011 . 
  the dude was just a total loser ; he had bad hygiene , would stand around waiting for people to tell him what to do , and would creepily hit on literally every single woman who looked at him . 
  i got the distinct impression that , were he raised in a white family , he would 've gotten way too into r/redpill or 4chan 's / pol . 
  there are now several somalis in our local and state government , a huge step in the right direction . 
  their community , if it ever was an isolated bubble from the rest of the city , certainly is n't one anymore . 
  guys like me buy most of their groceries from somali stores , nearly every taxicab company was either bought out or started by somali entrepreneurs , and the state colleges have enormous numbers of somali women enrolled in programs like business and nursing . 
  tl ; dr not a fan of all of the scarebait articles written by people who 've never even been to minneapolis , much less ever lived here . 
  there 's shit to be worried about , but nothing to lose our shit over . 
  this is the weird part for me as an american - our refugee and migrant populations intergrate * really * well . 
  i live in minneapolis , where 1/5th of the population is somali , and nobody under the age of 24 is n't fully conversational in english and going out on weekends like everyone else . 
  most women still wear scarves , but they incorporate it with modern fashion trends . 
  in my hometown next door , 1/4th of the population are hmong refugees from vietnam and laos , and it 's the same story - only the parents and grandparents ever have trouble intergrating . 
  remind me to edit with a link when i get home ; there is a thriving hmong hip hop scene in my old neighborhood , and this is just 20-25 years after their refugee parents showed up unprepared and unknowing of american culture . 
  well , it * might * have to do with the near-entirety of the polish nobility either fleeing abroad ( and not coming back/assimilating to their new countries ) or being murdered in the holocaust . 
  it 's crazy how far-flung polonia is - there are villages in rural turkey , even , with populations descended from exiled polish nobles .

  shostakovich is my favorite composer ( and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkshbayacna ) is my favorite of his works ) , but you ca n't possibly forget [ rachmaninoff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnyqz7sipqy ) - one of the three best pianists to ever live , along with liszt and chopin . 
  he also composed the [ vespers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx-pkuto2q4 ) , which is indispensably `` russian sounding '' and one of my top three choral pieces of all time . 
  that is definitely , unequivocally trump . 
  he 's even got an american flag behind him . 
  i did most of my shopping at biedronkas while driving through various towns ; american grocers ai n't got shit on the delicious , fresh and cheap food in poland !, 
  there 's a difference between `` misguided '' and `` stupid '' . 
  wars are misguided , state-of-the-art indoor farms in bumfuck nowhere are stupid . 
  the energy requirements for climate-controlling such a place in an extreme climate are absurdly , uselessly immense . 
  those funds could be used to build an entire small city in a region with a hospitable climate , or to donate enough farm equipment for an entire county in africa . 
  this is why these are the things that people are actually doing today , instead of pissing away billions of dollars on areas with fatally extreme weather . 
  i 'm just in minneapolis , and the weather right now is such that i would lose a few toes and fingers if i stayed outdoors for more than four hours without survival gear . 
  the vast , overwhelming majority of people in alaska buy their food in grocery stores , and [ it 's expensive as fuck ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/senatorlisamurkowski/sets/72157630782007502/ ) . 
  it is impossible to run a farm in 96 % of the state due to the climate , but one can easily do gardening in the summer or indoors , and there are plenty of livestock like sheep , cattle , and goats . 
  in winter , people in rural areas go hunting several times per week . 
  we would have to terraform the moon or mars , even if we put a pressurized atmosphere over a part of the surface , because ( as i 'm sure you are n't too stupid to know ) there is no soil outside of earth . 
  soil is made almost entirely out of decayed plant and animal matter ; all you have on the moon and mars is sand , rocks , and dust - worse for plants than even sand from the sahara desert . 
  it would be an immensely retarded waste of time and resources to increase the population of siberia when you consider that places like the us midwest , central ukraine , and zimbabwe are both hundreds of times more hospitable in climate and dozens of times more productive in agricultural terms . 
  the space wasted by suburban parking lots alone in the upper midwest is enough to grow food to feed 10 million people . 
  siberian weather will kill an underdressed adult in under an hour , for over a third of the year . 
  look at [ this map ] ( https://passel.unl.edu/image/martha/tim%20kettler/soiltemperatureregimes-lg.jpg ) of global soil types - everything `` frigid '' and above is next to impossible to grow sustainable year-round agriculture in ( unless you really like winter wheat , rye , and pickles and 1 person per 40 acres ) , and everything `` gelic '' and above is forlorn wasteland that can not naturally sustain conventional human habitation . 
  it 's clear that you are astoundingly ignorant about how agriculture works . 
  a very large number of polish troops were conscripted from polish exiles ( and legal french citizens all ) who lived in paris at the time . 
  i think someone with an / s tag is saying it . 
  oh man , total opposite ... prague , brno , and even olomouc are some of the most walking-friendly places i 've ever been in my life . 
  where poland got leveled and rebuilt by stalin , czechoslovakia were n't nearly as devastated , and had their own homegrown communists who had much less soviet visions for their urban planning ( but still made really fucking ugly buildings , like all the other communists ) . 
  are there more than ten radical muslims in all of poland ? 
  all i see anywhere are young moroccan or turkish guys with guido haircuts and loud tvs ... basically just like dresy , except they actually contribute to the economy by running businesses . 
  it 's not a matter of letting them , so much as it is an issue of finding them . 
  anywhere even a little bit north of st. petersburg is astoundingly remote and sparsely populated - but that 's exactly why so few people are crazy enough to try sneaking in that way . 
  it is much , much easier to catch a boat into the eu , or even just to book a one-way flight , than it is to hitchhike hundreds of kilometers for weeks on end . 
  meanwhile , only gda\u0144sk and krak\u00f3w are really super walkable , or the nicer small towns in pomerania and podhale ( safely assuming he 's polish by the username ) . 
  i 've been squatting like this my whole life in america , and often got weird looks for it ( fuck you it 's comfier than hour 3 + of just standing ) ... as soon as i visited poland for the first time , i was strangely overjoyed to see so many other people that do the same thing . 
  funny how you fucking * live there * , but have n't yet realized that most poles will pretty much invite you over for dinner if you start learning the polish language and have a passion for polish culture - regardless of your background . 
  maybe if you were a decent enough human being to attract friends that were n't dresy , you 'd have had this experience by now . 
  well , if you go by haplotype , the highest concentrations of slavic dna are in [ this region ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/r-m458_frequency_distribution.png ) covering almost all of poland and moravia , slovakia , and far-southeast belarus ... 
  fun fact : tavolara used to be home to a rare species , [ an enormous fat rabbit with short ears . 
  you do n't disagree with taking a series of steaming , creamy shits all over the constitution , and all while you would n't even have been fucking * born * if it was n't for the protections it afforded your family ? 
  i 'm utterly flabbergasted . 
  donald trump and his closest supporters have said as much [ here ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-anchor-babies-arent-american-citizens/ ) , [ here ] ( http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/08/indal_joins_trump_in_calling_f.html ) , and [ here ] ( http://www.factcheck.org/2015/11/trump-challenges-birthright-citizenship/ ) , for starters . 
  it 's a cornerstone of their agenda . 
  yes , and this is called immigration law . 
  passing our citizenship test is n't ( and should n't ever be ) easy . 
  mass deportations of * legal citizens * , due to the status , race , or religion of their parents , is a horrifying concept that should never have made it out of / pol . 
  when you 're `` dissenting '' the core fucking foundation of what america even * is * , then yeah , sane people tend to think you suck . 
  unless you 're an aboriginal or indigenous native american , you have zero fucking right to try and police who can legally immigrate here . 
  if you pass our citizenship test , or were born on our soil , you are an american - that 's all there is to it . 
  we 've been through this fight every generation since the country was founded , and always prevailed on the side of not being insane fascists , but this is the closest the usa has ever come to complete sabotage since the confederacy tried to found itself on explicit white supremacy . 
  at least 500 , but it 's hard to find exact numbers . 
  more than zero , for sure !, 
  it became popular entirely because of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmtzqcsh6xk ) - probably the first-ever viral video , at least on the scale we 're used to seeing now . 
  i 'm guessing you 're not any older than 25 ? 
  i paid for a priest 's tire in lubichowo last month , after it utterly exploded on the way back into town ... his church was where my ancestors got married , so since i exist due to his parish , least i could do !, 
  if you 're a white american , anyway . 
  when you 're already a heinz 57 blend of every european ethnicity there is ( and with a black or native american great-grandparent nobody talks about ) , then it is damn sure racist to try and pretend your `` heritage '' is any one thing besides american or canadian . 
  i am happy to have turkish-american family members - my cousin 's wife is from bodrum !, 
  she and her parents are all phd holding college professors , and staunch atheists , from a sufi background . 
  the * exact * same thing has happened with polish americans - the 2nd and 3rd generation , the ones between roughly 16-40 years old right now , are overwhelmingly on the far-right ( if not alt-right ) when compared to other immigrant groups . 
  look at guys like jack posobiec and corey lewandowski for some famous examples . 
  there are other , stupider people even further to the right of pis ; like the mra neckbeards of korwin . 
  they generally support pis policies , including the latest attempts to sabotage the courts . 
  the country is deeply politically divided right now ; essentially between the far-right ( who are in power with one single large party , pis ) and `` literally everyone else '' ( who are divided between eight smaller parties with widely differing views ) . 
  poland is in the midst of a pretty major culture war right now , between conservatives/racists/devout catholics on one side and leftists/pro-glbt/agnostics on the other . 
  each side is intractably convinced that the other will be the death of all poland . 
  russia has * more * to gain by letting knuckle-dragging dumbasses fall for bullshit conspiracy theories , than it does by killing nato heads of state . 
  the unrest in poland directly benefits them ; having an obnoxious yappy chihuahua for a neighbor means they can use that as an excuse to build up their military .
