so i guess you hold grudges against japan and brazil too ? 
  2 attempts , mainly because i confuse brunei and east timor , and qatar with bahrain . 
  just do n't ask me to do west africa , the carribbean , or the pacific islands and i 'm good . 
  i was briefly happy but confused , considering how bad we 're told the u.s. is ... and then read it correctly and sighed . 
  the french are better at finding italy than finding france . 
  i 've heard `` you lot '' a few times on random british programs . 
  being from the northeast us , i use `` you guys '' ; only time i use `` you all '' is to say to a group `` you all suck . '', 
  can the translation for ` discomfort ' or being ` uncomfortable ' in a particular social situation convey a similar meaning to ` awkward ' ? 
  i would be afraid to buy anything from # 8 , he 'd probably kill me . 
  though if you gave him an old coat and sailor 's cap , he 'd be the perfect salty old sea captain . 
  only if you have two really big oceans in between you and the fronts . 
  love live soviet canuckistan !, 
  good thing you 're covered now . 
  so barring any major political developments , do local elections in turkey reflect how the general elections usually go ? 
  on a secondary note , fethullah gulen lives 15 minutes away from me in saylorsburg , pa. . how bizarre . 
  the typical representative in the u.s. represents about 700,000 people . 
  obviously this fluctuates since states with a million people have 2 representatives ( 500,000 per representative ) while vermont with 625,000 people gets one representative . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_and_territories_by_population ) has a column that lists the average population represented by one representative in each state . 
  the questions are random except the first question ( how you address a group of 2 or more people ) . 
  i found this out since i accidentally refreshed midway through it . 
  and apparently only nyc and jersey pronounces mary , merry and marry differently ... mary and marry i can understand sounding similar , but not merry . 
  you guys made cultural adaptations of jersey shore ? 
  what the hell is wrong with you europe ( or at least spain/uk ) ? 
  this makes me feel even worse than just knowing of jersey shore 's existence . 
  i 've read almost all of this , especially since most of it pertains to ukraine , by viewing [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/live/3rgnbke2rai6hen7ciytwcxadi?t=t ) it 's been going strong but lately at times the information flow has started to trickle . 
  he definitely meant the eu , as that 700m number for europe would include the european part of russia , which has like 75 % of russia 's population . 
  and i do n't think they 'd fight themselves . 
  also , japan 's population is closer to 125m . 
  because when tons of us credit agencies downgraded the us ' status in 2011 , that was in its favor . 
  the senate held a hearing on puerto rico 's status due to the referendum and the house has approved $ 2.5 m for a new puerto rican plebiscite that the white house requested . 
  do n't know if the senate has approved it . 
  so now there will be a federally funded referendum as opposed to one that was funded by pr 's government . 
  additionally , the resident commissioner for puerto rico in the house of representatives is gathering support among congressmen for pr statehood should in the case a bill for statehood is proposed . 
  but yes , there has n't been either an approval or rejection of the results . 
  unless you ask the pro- / anti-statehood parties in pr . 
  thanks , i did look for industrial prices but could n't seem to find anything . 
  what , the link ? 
  you need to click one of the quick chart buttons above the graph , since they do n't have a separate url . 
  click ' 8 years ' for example . 
  we 're actually far less hysterical and paranoid than you think . 
  i grew up in nyc and would walk to school many times since the age of 9-10 , and stayed home alone almost all the time . 
  and i was n't just some anomaly in the area . 
  our media is terrible and histrionic . 
  i would like to know where he got that information about gas prices dropping by 2/3rds since 2008 , because my personal experience and [ this ] ( http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx ) price chart say otherwise . 
  ireland seems very concerned about the wealth of other nations ... rich , poor , how expensive it is ... clearly , russia [ invaded ] ( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080824153903aag7oja ) georgia for their peaches in 2008 . 
  maybe monaco is just poland in distress . 
  that said , i guess poland does n't care about andorra , san marino , malta , cyprus or the vatican . 
  [ usually , but not always . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_russo-turkish_wars ) every war is different , but i highly doubt turkey will do much if something happened to the tatars besides blocking access through the bosphorus . 
   priyebaltic sounds similar to ` pribaltika ' , which is what the region was/is called by russia . 
  so we can drive to riga to make an offering to the porcelain god ? 
  would n't b or c have to be done somewhat concurrently , especially with russia stoking tension in eastern ukraine ? 
  it seems like even in that case russia would just ramp up tensions in response to any moves along those lines by the west . 
  you reminded me of an east german joke ... :  a school teacher asks little fritzie : `` fritzchen , why are you always speaking of our soviet brothers ? 
  it 's ` soviet friends ' . '', 
  fritz responds : `` well , you can pick your friends . '', 
  there 's also 30-300 troops that were allocated to one of the baltics . 
  not that they 're anything more than a ` tripwire ' force . 
  would n't transparent boxes in elections show the boxes are n't pre-stuffed ? 
  i agree , there are tons of other flaws with this referendum , and this ai n't one of them . 
  well , stats show the most reported ancestries are german and irish , though english is n't far behind . 
  that said , english ancestry is probably underreported here because people treat english ancestry like it 's a blank slate ; nothing ; vanilla . 
  it 's odd . 
  hey , are you insinuating i have english ancestry ? 
  well , maybe i do , considering everything the english did in ireland . 
  but as far as i know i 'm irish . 
  and a little norwegian . 
  and fine . 
  i 'm from the totally real st. marisa in the caribbean . 
  it 's next to st. lucia . 
  this sounds familiar ... on an entirely unrelated note , i 'm canadian . 
  the only thing mentioned that originated in american english is that annoying habit journalists have of tacking ' - gate ' onto the end of every scandal . 
  ca n't we just use scandal or affair again ? 
  from what i 've heard , the russian black sea coast is very shallow , which is n't really suitable for military ships . 
  here 's what crimea and russia are offering the tatars , from [ here ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-tries-to-win-over-crimean-tatars/25294599.html ) :  on march 11 , the crimean parliament passed a resolution declaring it will `` guarantee the rights of the crimean tatar nation and its integration into crimean society . '', 
   the resolution promised reforms including the tatar language official status , placing it legally on par with russian and ukrainian in the region . 
   it also calls for crimean tatars to hold at least 20 percent of the cabinet posts in the region 's government , to be represented local government structures , and for the mejlis to be recognized as a legitimate institution of self-governance . 
   lawmakers also pledged to guarantee religious freedom for the predominantly muslim tatars and to fund programs to support the crimean tatar community -- including the repatriation of those deported on the orders of soviet dictator josef stalin . 
  the tatars did n't seem to buy it though . 
  so business as usual for boston ? 
  you get brazil , and spain gets the rest of the americas , okay ? 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/ex-eucom.htm ) a listing i could find for some military exercises the u.s. participates in in europe . 
  greyed out rows seem to be one-offs , but the others list the frequency , time of year , and the locations they usually occur . 
  the directory above that lists other regions the u.s. has exercises in if anyone is interested . 
  ca n't tell if you 're being sarcastic , but your government participated in the spying , and wanted to get into the ` five eyes ' group . 
  xkeyscore , project6 ... the bnd is the nsa 's most prolific partner , you know . 
  [ link 1 ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligence-worked-closely-with-nsa-on-data-surveillance-a-912355-2.html ) [ link2 ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligence-sends-massive-amounts-of-data-to-the-nsa-a-914821.html ) [ link 3 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/nsa-portrait-total-surveillance ), 
  someone needs to tell the uk government that there are these opaque things called ` folders ' you can stuff secret documents in so you do n't have them constantly photographed every time you stroll around downing street . 
  unless they want to have them photographed in some kind of feint , but i think that 's being too generous to any politician . 
  scotland wants nothing to do with the rest of the uk in regards to furries . 
  i 'd turn my nose up at jack daniels too , because it tastes like bananas . 
  i hate bananas . 
  ca n't say i 've had any blended scotch that tasted like it , though i 've tried some bad cheap blends ( looking at you , grant 's ) . 
  i think people here are more sensitive about any type of balkan irredentism , even if it was only in jest . 
  damn russia and its partitioning of poles . 
  for the us , [ these ] ( http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm ) are the costs to produce each bill denomination , while our coins cost about 1.25 cents per penny , 8 cents per nickel , 4 cents per dime , 10 cents for a quarter , and about 15 cents for a dollar coin . 
  i imagine these values are roughly similar to euro bill and coin costs . 
  however , a dollar coin can stay in circulation for over 30 years compared to the 18-22 month lifespan of a bill . 
  even with hoarding taking coins out of circulation , i think it 's still cheaper .
