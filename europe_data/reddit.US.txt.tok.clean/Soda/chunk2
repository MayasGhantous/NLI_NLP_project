  scramble for europe ? 
  i said four different nations patrol during each 4 month cycle , not that only four nations total patrol the baltics . 
  maybe they should respect the `` cultural habits '' of those they just infringed upon . 
  well , the patrols are done by about 4 nations each 4 month cycle or so , so it seems unlikely that the decision is solely due to a minor military scandal in denmark . 
  by google global index , they mean google also enforces dmcas on non-us domains such as google.fr ? 
  as long as it 's a friendly competition this time that fosters innovation , i 'm for it . 
  none of the soviet landings on mars were actually successful in transmitting any data after landing , unfortunately . 
  the us had also sent flies , monkeys , and mice into space before the soviets did . 
  i 'm not going to really look it up since it 's past 4 am here , but the name thing is partially due to grammar concerns , is it not ? 
  in that case , is there an official language college that deals with new foreign words , such as terms for newly invented technologies ? 
  or am i thinking of something else entirely ? 
  i feel as though that would depend on austria-hungary 's post-wwi fate , had the victors been more lenient towards germany and a-h . that , and if the allied intervention during the russian civil war was more substantial . 
  well , those would be the two big factors that could have dramatically changed how eastern european history played out . 
  all those wars in the east from 1918-22 and various other little factors would have nudged things another way . 
  i wonder if anyone 's wrote some alternate history books about a different post-wwi eastern europe . 
  sure did n't act that way back then ... 
  i do n't see why we would n't . 
  i 'm pretty sure irish poitin , cream , and whiskey are already protected in the us due to ftas we have with the eu . 
  edit : [ here 's ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/5.22 ) part of the federal standards of identity for distilled spirits , which defines what is considered irish whiskey in the united states . 
  basically any whiskey calling itself irish must conform to what the laws of ireland say is irish whiskey . 
  i ca n't find anything on the protection of irish cream or poitin in the us , but i also can not find any cases of irish cream or poitin being made by us companies either . 
  i think you 're confusing extreme examples of stupid americans you 've seen with reality . 
  [ compared to others , ] ( https://i.imgur.com/6s58c9k.jpg ) we 're only really retarded regarding evolution . 
  i hope it 's a wild one currently unknown to researchers . 
  need more genetic diversity . 
  not doubting you , but are there any polls regarding that , particularly one that includes the views of people in transnistria ? 
  many polls seem to just exclude it , likely due to its situation . 
  the real question here is if the pope shit in the woods . 
  all you have to do is eat it in a very germanic manner . 
  thanks for the info , and pardon my previous ignorance . 
  so essentially mass indifference , or is not commonly discussed ? 
  if you combined with denmark , you 'd probably be their worst nightmare . 
  high-five japan !, 
  that was n't a compliment . 
  in all seriousness , we 're slowly changing , state by state , and we 've had 7 states in the past 8 years abolish the death penalty . 
  [ here 's a map with details .

  [ the queen of sweden is from canada ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ontario_general_election,_2003#.22evil_reptilian_kitten-eater_from_another_planet.22 ), 
  compared to the sauds , it is small i believe . 
  the uk royal family spent about 5.1 million pounds last year according to the daily mail , but that was for over 4,000 engagements , and not vacation . 
  i know it 's the daily mail , but it was the first quick source i found . 
  and this thread was removed too . 
  maybe make a fucking announcement and you wo n't have to delete threads , mods . 
  well , it was n't just set to private , it was switched back and forth multiple times within the span of a few minutes . 
  this megathread also disappeared and reappeared as well . 
  it 's back , and this thread 's been deleted . 
  thanks , mods . 
  yes , it keeps switching on and off . 
  mod fight perhaps ? 
  slowly uniting cyprus , one piece of cheese at a time . 
  it was stated a year before the crimean crisis that the memorandum was n't legally binding as well . 
  we did n't have to do anything if we did n't want to do so . 
  so basically , everyone makes fun of their neighbors , though some mocking is unrequited . 
  there , there , netherlands , i 'm sure you 're at least the second-most mocked in belgium . 
  also , hungary , what did the scots ever do to you ? 
  edit : and italy mocks itself , because apparently no one else cares to mock it the most . 
  so your rationale is that since they were n't punished , neither should russia ? 
  typical whataboutism . 
  secondly , the legion of merit was n't awarded for shooting down the airliner , though it was awarded for service during a span of time that included the shooting down of the airliner . 
  the awarding made no mention of shootdown , however . 
  thirdly , if you want to talk about how the us also shot down an airliner , [ you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007 ) [ forgot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaleva_\\ ( airplane \\ ) ) [ a few ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_902 ) soviet incidents . 
  long story short , all these shootdown incidents are reprehensible . 
  edit : fixing some grammar and my apparent inability to count . 
  and by ` these shootdowns ' , i also meant the american shootdown of iranian air 655 . 
  since we all knew this was going to be the outcome , i 'll ask another question : why is new zealand 's representative wearing two watches ? 
  for different time zones ? 
  well , for cars sold in the uk market at least . 
  though i 'm pretty sure the non-na ford cars are much different , and almost none are sold in na . 
  clapping for what reason , exactly ? 
  i am really wondering where in the us you went , since it is very different from what i learned in new york . 
  we learned of mussolini 's rise and march on rome , his policies and the second italo-ethiopian war , as well as the italian campaign , mussolini 's dismissal by the king , the republic of salo , and mussolini 's death . 
  what we learned was still far less than what we studied on japan and germany of course . 
  it really depends on what state you studied in as they have different standards and curriculum . 
  and the u20 world cup last week . 
  you guys are doing well in sports this past week or so . 
  yeah , but all of the english speakers who are n't fluent in spanish become pregnant when we use the wrong words . 
  water tastes better than bud lite . 
  russia asked that the list not be made public ? 
  what a ridiculous request . 
  ah , so that 's why russia is banning memes . 
  the crimes the us are investigating were carried out in the us , and involved the use of us banks . 
  the swiss reviewed the claims made by the us and agreed to arrest the individuals , who are all conmebol and concacaf execs . 
  as spin0 said , the swiss are doing their own separate investigation into fifa regarding the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 wcs . 
  secondly , should a us company , or individuals of that company , be immune to prosecution if they carry out crimes in , say , switzerland , but are part of a us company ? 
  this is n't some illegal overreach as the russians claim . 
  they should focus more of their outrage on the swiss , who are now investigating the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 wcs . 
  only nasty british press lies and are poor sports . 
  right , mr. blatter ? 
  it 's beautiful . 
  i 'll hang it up on my refrigerator . 
  there are two separate investigations being conducted by the us and the swiss , though they coordinated the criminal proceedings in zurich for efficiency . 
  they also unsealed blazer 's guilty plea today , along with warner 's sons ' guilty pleas , according to the us doj [ press release .

  sepp blatter is smaug ? 
  i recall a few years ago on reddit someone critiquing his art and why it was n't passable . 
  the one critiqued is n't here , but it was something about his sense of scale , depth , and proportion being awful or something . 
  wish i could find it again but i 'm too tired now to look ( 4:30 in the morning here ) . 
  oh , how cheery ... 
  that 's largely due to becoming a default european user subreddit .
