  china does n't exactly have the best logistics capacity in the world . 
  that makes no sense though . 
  the alt-right , especially in the us , hates the russians . 
  hell the alt-right is the party of palin 's whole `` i can see russia from my back porch , therefore we should nuke them '' schtick . 
  most of the us alt-right would love nothing more than to see moscow disappear in a ball of nuclear fire asap . 
  so why would putin support them ? 
  three to five seconds usually , more if there was any teamkilling involved . 
  so what , they 're just going to take all the immigrants and throw them out into the plains ? 
  britain does not have the infrastructure to sustain mass immigration , hell the uk is already struggling to provide for the 65 million who live there currently . 
  unless their economy expands in a big way , there is no way they 'd be able to sustain current levels of immigration from the eu . 
  except most of them are retarded teens having hissy fits . 
  the reason do many of them bring up the `` what about the under-18s '' schtick is because most of them are in that 16-17 y/o demographic and are pissed . 
  okay , you still have 17 million men vs 8 million . 
  and no rearmament program in china would go unanswered by the rest of sea . 
  if anything a chinese rearmament would spark am arms race they ca n't possibly hope to win . 
  all it would do is take existing disadvantages and exacerbate them significantly . 
   would really all neighboring asian countries go to war with china over europe ? 
  yes , because that would mean china is invading * them * . 
   if china is involved there would be war in korea , taiwan maybe with india & friends . 
  if china started a multi-front war in sea , they would get absolutely clobbered . 
  china has a combined active and reserve military of just over 2.5 million troops split between all service branches . 
  add in their allies in best korea and you get another 5.2 million for just over 7.7 million troops . 
  now let 's compare major regional rivals . 
  india : 3.4 million active service and reserve personnel south korea : 3.5 million active service and reserve pakistan : 1.1 million active and reserve taiwan : about 2 million active service and reserve vietnam : ** 5.4 million ** active service and reserve singapore : about 1 million overall japan , indonesia , thailand : altogether about 1.6 million overall and honestly there 's a few more i could include with smaller troop numbers who would contribute as well . 
  just on these alone , that 's about ** 18 million active service and reserve personnel ** that are , for the most part , specifically there because if china starts making aggressive land grabs with their military , the rest of sea is going to * freak the fuck out * because from wwii they all know what happens when a major asian power starts invading its neighbors , especially one with as poor a human rights track record as china . 
  that is why the extent of china 's active conflict aggression was interference in the korean war - because as fractured and divided a region as sea is , a militarily active china is the one thing that would fix all of that , because no matter how scared the pakistanis are of the indians or the indians are of the pakistanis , they 're both scared of china more . 
  speaking of those two , they also have nukes and together about match the size of china 's nuclear arsenal , and srbms are a * lot * harder to intercept than mrbms and icbms . 
  so there 's that too . 
  if the russians decided to invade europe with chinese support , the chinese support would last about as long as it takes the us ambassador to go to sea and watch every country in the region that is n't named `` china '' or `` north korea '' kicking the shit out of those two , ask if they need any help , and get told `` nah we got this fam '' . 
  then the us fully commits to the european front and russia is fucked . 
   we would lose . 
  with a 100 % kill ratio pull the other one  we simply have fewer missiles than they have planes . 
  the chinese air force and naval air force have combined just a little over 3700 aircraft , most of which are either helicopters or support rather than frontline fixed-wing aircraft . 
  even if you include those , however , the us still has more sams than that - the issue is the range , since us sam doctrine is for close support moving with the infantry . 
  * however * the navy 's sam doctrine is a completely different story , utilizing multitudes of missiles that exceed the reach of even some of the chinese anti-ship bms . 
  these missiles are also carried in sufficient numbers to force the plaaf into a defensive stance . 
  well , that combined with the fact that the us navy on its own operates as many aircraft as the plaaf and plan combined . 
  with the addition of air force flights flying out of every us base in the area , the plaaf will be unable to hold air superiority over the battlefield . 
  the plaaf and plan are not of any concern to long-term strategy in an all-out conventional war against china . 
   in korea back then , we agreed to a ceasefire , because it was either that , defeat , or nuclear war . 
  in korea we agreed to a ceasefire because there was no reason not to . 
  the un mission had never been to capture north korea or defeat china , that was entirely mcarthur 's doing . 
  furthermore , after the initial shock of the chinese entry into the war wore off , mcarthur removed , and the un forces reorganized , the chinese offensive halted completely , only three months after their initial entry - and at that point the chinese started to take disproportionately higher casualties than the un forces . 
  had the war continued the chinese would have been forced to break off their offensive completely . 
   in vietnam , we would have lost militarily , eventually vietnam was a vastly different situation . 
  line battles with the nva were rare and there was significant resistance from the south vietnamese as well - that was one of the major failures of vietnam , that the army was trying to use battle line tactics against an enemy relying almost entirely on guerilla warfare . 
  since then the us has adapted incredibly well to countering guerilla ops with special operations units rather than gis , and has developed immensely successful tactics to counter guerilla operations . 
  all of that is irrelevant in a war with china however as anything worth invading in china is in huge urban centers along the coast . 
  guerilla warfare would never come into it because either a ) the cities would be bombed to dust , then a landing force would establish bases , or b ) a landing force would make land , and after fierce urban fighting , would likely result in the landing force falling back , letting the navy shell the shit out of the city , and * then * establishing a base . 
  once you 've captured the coast , there 's really nothing of great importance to capture inland . 
  you move in your artillery and your bombers and your land fighters and if the chinese attempt to rally to retake the territory they get hit with enough conventional munitions to completely destroy some european nations . 
  at the end of the day , china does n't fight because china knows it ca n't win . 
  nothing they produce is impossible to procure from elsewhere in an emergency situation , and the one resource they * could * have had a stranglehold on , they tried to fuck with and that ended up convincing everyone else to just mine it themselves , destroying the chinese monopoly and any chance they had to leverage control of that resource in a war . 
  even if the war went nuclear , they have a pitifully small number of warheads and launch vehicles , especially launch vehicles capable of hitting the us . 
  and even if they did fire off all their nukes at once , a single aegis unit can track every warhead , and a single us navy csg is capable of shooting down every single one - to say nothing of what happens when there are multiple csgs all dedicated to intercepting those missiles . 
  active = / = effective . 
  in 1939 you could also say that the german army had n't been less active recently than the british one , but the british army was still the stronger and more competent land force . 
  i am . 
  the strength of will of french leaders is an entirely different issue from the fact that their army is only somewhat more well trained than the bundswher . 
  they can have a word . 
  having an aircraft carrier does n't change the fact that if you were to judge whether the french military was a military force or a daycare , `` daycare '' would be the more appropriate response . 
  because beside us and poland they have the only competent military in nato ? 
  because the financial link between north america and asia that the uk provides is absolutely vital ? 
  because we 're constantly looking for markets for our cheap produce and britain is a perfect target for that now ? 
  suck my supercarrier sized red-white-and-blue dick putin, 
  no shit . 
  shakespeare ? 
  please , you can do a lot better than that hack in terms of famous britons . 
  and as usual , no-one has read the article . 
  london provides more than 3.2 million service sector jobs . 
  at least one million of these are banking jobs . 
  as much as everyone likes to shit on britain now , if 70000 banking jobs and what eu business 3rd country status ca n't obtain are all that 's at stake , london will be just fine . 
  for those thinking this is going to be a nice kick to russia , let me remind you that the cia is the same organization that never realized that almost every agent they had working in eastern europe was a double-agent for the soviets . 
  as much as everyone is upset about the uk trying to mess things up for the eu leading up to the actual negotiations , i feel i should mention that this move was most likely taken because that 's exactly what the uk fears as well - that coming off of rhetoric such as hollande 's the eu would abuse its position to inflict significant damage to the uk leading up to the negotiations . 
  it 's clear from this point on that the uk and eu intend to continue on not as partners but as enemies , and frankly i find myself questioning whether the two ever even thought of each other as partners to begin with . 
  it was * a * reason for leaving , part of the `` bad economy '' thing . 
  the uk has a lot of people who only qualify for low-end jobs , and not enough low-end jobs to go around . 
  except * that 's exactly what they did * . 
  what , you think that london being a major global financial center is a new thing ? 
  no , not at all , many of these banks had major operations in london long before the eu ever took shape . 
  in addition to being the home of the only bank in the top five world banks that is n't chinese ( hello hsbc holdings ) , many banks had major offices there even when the eec existed and the uk had not yet joined . 
  business from the eu was a nice icing on the cake for london , but anyone who thinks london 's value is tied to being an english-speaking point of access to the eu is the sole reason for its success could not be more wrong . 
  london 's value before the turn of the century was in its value as a ) where everyone happened to be all at once , which is n't going to change , and b ) the presence of the largest market for metals trading in the world , the london metals exchange . 
  since then london has built up more than just the metals trading and the financial connections , and has gotten their hands into a little bit of everything , most of which has little to do with the eu . 
  hell , forget the euro trading , that 's pennies compared to the dollar trading , in which london clears more us dollars every year than fucking * new york city * . 
  so while yes , the business of the eu in its entirety ( and that business is n't going to go away in its entirety ) is worth a few hundred billion , that does n't even begin to match up to the * tens of trillions * that is n't even remotely dependent on the eu . 
  far too much of the youth vote was tied to remain for that to work . 
  e , steel is one of the few things the uk still manufactures and import of chinese steel * is one of the reasons the uk left in the first place *, 
  the ones dependent on the eu will leave . 
  everything else will stay . 
  the eu 's financial institutions are n't exactly unimportant but there 's a reason london is a * global * financial capital , and the eu has surprisingly little to do with that . 
  unfortunately for the french , most are going to come back up new york instead . 
  maybe i should switch to a finance major . 
  in other news , grass grows, 
  or they could all be surprised when nothing serious happens . 
  it all depends on how soon britain makes an official stance on its negotiation goals and what outcomes the markets predict . 
  quite frankly an improvement over current trends is actually quite likely . 
  markets already been caught with its pants down playing the side of optimism , if wager they 're pricing for pessimism this time , meaning good news to the market unless britain has trump negotiate for them or something like that . 
  if that was the case there should be no reserve currencies . 
  the automatic selloff that hit the pound recently was an accident triggered by the limits of programming .
