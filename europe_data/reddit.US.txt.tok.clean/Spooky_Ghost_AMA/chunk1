no one got around to putting up a few signs in the empty desert though . 
  * estonia * france * greece * united kingdom * turkey * united states < 3 honorable mentions to poland and portugal at 1.9 % . 
   what do we get out of nato ? 
  do you feel even slightly more secure with germany and france being in an alliance with us ? 
  having allies around is always around is good , which is why i would always stay in nato . 
  the only counties i would trust in a war are canada and uk . 
  france and others are if-y and german polls show they do not want to defend a nato ally . 
  like europe would ever leave the one thing that let 's them get away with barely any defense spending, 
  just ask eritrea !, 
  i 'm talking about firing into the air . 
  there 's no control of where the bullet lands . 
  i think our scenarios are different and that is a major part of the trouble . 
  when i think of a person entering my home i think of a violent person who would be willing to kill me . 
  it happens multiple times in my area . 
  in the us , if someone just wants your stuff , they will break in when you 're out . 
  if someone breaks into your home while you 're there , it 's called a home invasion . 
  in a home invasion , not only does it show they are violent enough to invade your home , but likely harm you in the process - therefore in it completely justified to shoot a person intruding in your home . 
  so basically when i imaging a person entering my home it 's not just to steal , but to likely harm me or even kill me . 
  the us actually has the exact same system you described and the castle doctrine . 
  iirc there was a man who lied in wait in the basement of a house he owned . 
  he was waiting for some teenagers who had been trespassing to return . 
  he immediately shot both the boy and girl when they entered the basement and he is now in jail for murder . 
   escalating a violence prone situation with firearms if anything i would consider that situation already escalated to violence . 
   but a warning shot here is not firing over someone 's head for intimation : it encompasses shooting in the air in a safe way . 
  even that would likely be attempted murder . 
  a officer firing into the air would be bigger trouble because there is no control of were the bullet lands . 
  in the end , it 's just a difference of culture , and europeans have less of a reason to fire . 
  what the fuck are you smoking son . 
  that sounds absurd to me . 
  what am i supposed to do ? 
  respectfully reason with them ? 
   discharged to warn persons if you 're firing a weapon it 's to kill no matter what . 
  if a civilian fires a gun at a person , it 's attempted murder , not a `` warning . '', 
  drawing a firearm is considered the warning . 
  your entire argument itt that i have seen so far is just an entire assumption and blanket statements on us police . 
   for example the so called `` castle doctrine '' are signs of a society that is deeply afraid . 
  what would be the point of firearm ownership if it is illegal to shoot an intruder in your own home or vehicle ? 
   take note , country i have no experience in .

   glitterbombs spare / r/europe the pain and just use napalm . 
  you have to ask yourself : is / u/flobberdoodle a * true * leader ? 
  you may ask : how is / u/spooky _ ghost_ama a better leader ? 
  *** double *** the amount . 
  but how will a boring and standard system get op upvotes ? 
  oh , just take a picture of what he voted for to rake in the karma . 
  their / r/propagandaposters were too . 
  i love simple and great propaganda posters like that . 
  this is more us-europe relations sided but whatever . 
  1 ) ** europeans are just as `` patriotic '' as americans are . 
  ** it gets touted like europeans are more worldly and less ignorant than anyone else on the planet . 
  meanwhile i believe this patriotism just gets funneled into ideas instead . 
  the eu also a whole , healthcare , the eu army pipedream . 
  all of this things are big ideas that never stop being discussed and being dreamed about expanding . 
  it just seems to dominate just a us `` patriotism '' does . 
  ** give it up , the atf is n't going to round up the guns tomorrow because of a law passed overnight . 
  2a ) ** just because you read a article does n't mean you are able to solve the us 's problems by a 10 minute diagnosis ** ( inb4 irony on me , i know ok ) . 
  you do not live your life in the us , and your `` expert advice '' is really bunk platitudes about topics that will not effect you . 
  3 ) ** eu army is a pipe dream . 
  ** idk is this is `` unpopular '' but it is a widespread idea . 
  no nations want to send every single troop into a big army . 
  not to mention the factors of it being effective . 
  can it actually deploy quickly ? 
  can others not suddenly withdraw all the troops ? 
  not to mention language barriers . 
  4 ) ** europe uses the us as it 's war puppet . 
  ** i feel like everytime there is a middle east threat , the us gets an assurance that nato members will follow up in attacks . 
  meanwhile these `` joint forces '' never seem to have much of any european forces fully committed to the attacks . 
  it just seems like there 's a pressure to do something , but when the first drone strike hits a kid ( which always happens when one group bombs another ) , then europe gets self rightous and does n't want to touch the hot potato anymore . 
  this leaves the us standing by itself with blood on it 's hands looking guilty of doing everything by itself . 
  i 'm pretty interested actually . 
  what 's your view on it ? 
  around to poland in 80 days . 
  i 'm at least 60 % sure this is a doctored photo .

  update : [ second convoy to follow first convoy . ], 
  spoiler : it 's already begun . 
  i never even heard of breitbart until this comment . 
  i checked the site and it is truly lie central . 
  twist : 4chan was snowden, 
  go buy yourselves something nice . 
  \\  murica is one united country \\  yurop is 57 countries with some in a union, 
   and soon enough military too . 
  \\  trying to imply they would put up the funds for one . 
  oh wait they 'll just take our money . 
  oh the eu army ? 
  / r/europe 's pipedream ? 
  nato is a alliance . 
  a coalition 's countries can send as many or as few troops as they want . 
  meanwhile a eu army has to be authorized to be used by the people who have their militaries in the army . 
  a solution would be to have independent nations keep armies and contribute some to the eu army . 
  but keeping in mind european countries do n't keep large armies like the us , it means half of the nation 's army sits in barracks as a pseudo-peacekeeping force not being used . 
  i 'm trying to say a eu army wo n't work because the diverse countries would gridlock it . 
  meanwhile a nato with independent diverse countries allows each country to pursue their own interests , which is quicker and better . 
  exactly , and a united country as diverse as europe is not going to go well . 
  if the eu gets a army , it 'll stand in the barracks and go no where . 
  if there is a unified army , then everyone will want to have a say in what the army does ( and rightfully so ) . 
  this also means nations will bicker over the military 's use until hell freezes over . 
  it slows and/or breaks nato cooperation , and allows gridlock , something a army does n't need .
