your comment made me laugh so hard at work that i am now an outcast . 
  i must now leave the united states and move to denmark . 
  get outta here donald trump !, 
  outside , go outside !, 
  bad donald !, 
  that seems logical and concise . 
  if its true ( not doubting you i just have no way of knowing ) then that alleviates a lot of the concern about economic migrant leeching . 
  it still does n't deter the potential of terrorist agents being able to move about freely , but it does handle a lot of concerns that are being repeated over and over by dissenters . 
  where are the migrant cats requesting ` cheezeburger ' when you need them ? 
  fuck you green chariot bastard !, 
  blue chariot team forever !, 
  i like to see misconceptions like this , it is the only way i can see outside of the us and can be quite educational . 
  there are normal people in the us , but we are usually pretty quiet . . the kind you speak of are so loud that you will never see people like me  good to see your view !, 
  my grandparents were born in the 20s , i knew them very well and talked at great lengths about their upbringing and cultural shifts . 
  i can tell you that at no time was `` public gang rapes and molestation '' acceptable . 
  we may have come a long way but you are grasping at straws to compare a culture that many of us in the us ( and europe i 'm sure ) are directly connected to with a culture that fears exposed hair follicles . 
  nope just sand , sad people , and black water . 
  hey hey hey , that 's unfair . 
  he 's not the american who invaded iraq , i am . 
  it 's okay though , simple mixup . 
  my bad everybody . 
  i think i 've seen you somewhere before [ sweden ] ( https://i.imgur.com/uiengha.png ) . 
  yeah , the votes show everyone can see through his shit . 
  its obviously a crazy person and/or delusional . 
  i imagine they 'll see the downvotes and just think how superior they are for resisting ` the hivemind ' . 
  such smart . 
  what is this floating point you talk of ? 
  i am american citizen and definitely not refugee looking to float across small ocean to europe , do not think that . 
  you should not be suspicious . 
  please send schematics for floating point to my email yolo_refugee1989@gmail.com, 
  is this one of those drinking games where we all have to ask a question ? 
  you were pretty generous with that link too . 
  most of the eagle screeches i found on youtube sounded like possessed farts . 
  i just learned this today , can it be true ? 
  european deer ca n't read ?!, 
  why are you guys allowing illiterate deer to cross your borders !, 
  these deer must be educated in the ways of humans !, 
  in the usa all deer get a college education and - $ 120k debtor package before being released to the wild for hunting . 
  we invest heavily in the wildlife of the country , teaching owls to ride bicycles , deer to read , and squirrels to beat box . 
  every bear in america is trained in combat personally by steven segal !, 
  europeans should be ashamed of yourselves . 
  ** [ ( eagle screech ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnblca5w6hu ) **, 
  i donno what you 're talking about . 
  my wife had a baby yesterday , at that rate i must project i will have 365 babies this time next year , no idea how i will afford it . 
  y' all wan na go huntin ' ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ tell ^ ^ ^ ^ anyone ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ american ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ terrified ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ getting ^ ^ ^ ^ sick . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ its ^ ^ ^ ^ basically ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ financial ^ ^ ^ ^ death ^ ^ ^ ^ sentence . 
  yea but you guys use commas instead of periods to denote fractions of a whole . . let me translate that to finnish . 
  * `` yea but you guys use commas instead of periods to denote fractions of a whole , , '' * i am just unable to understand why do n't poor people just ask their parents to buy them more money from the money store ? 
  i mean duh , how else do they expect to pay their horse upkeep or butler fees ? 
  that 's how my family does it !, 
  worst case scenario they could sell a summer home or access their second trust fund . 
  i am not sure why but your link is ( at the current time ) not working for me . 
  the guns region needs to be expanded to the entire middle of the country including everything east of [ arizona/montana ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wct1ta12bqa/tgttp0nmwii/aaaaaaaaeqq/1cxomzrvln4/s1600/mapa.gif ) , excluding northeastern cities and southern florida because only retired northeasterners and cubans live there . 
  where are the outer banks !, 
  jk best one i 've seen . 
  north dakota and south dakota , wow this guy really knows his stuff . 
  . . m , m , m-middle dakota and west dakota ? 
  this guy was hired by the dakota tribe pr team obviously . 
  / r/hailcorporate, 
  so canada is a whale ( complete with blowhole ) , the us is a t-rex , and mexico is reverse italy ( shoe ) . 
  being from the carolinas i find it funny you put nc/sc above virginia but it 's totally understandable . 
  also your knowledge and sketch of florida is uncharacteristically detailed compared to the rest of the states which i assume you sub-contracted to michael j fox . 
  hypothetically , in my society we kick dogs for luck . 
  my granddad kicked dogs , my dad kicked dogs , my brother kicks dogs . 
  i come to your house , i kick your dog . 
  you , `` damn , i ca n't figure out why he kicks my dog . '', 
  you 're like an anti-sherlock . 
  hey you ca n't just go around calling people retired , my brother was born retired and we always told him he was special and unique . 
  you make me sick . 
  the only flaw i see in this plan is skyrocketing cost of fake moustache and old people hats . 
  there just is n't the supply for enough pensioner disguise . 
  reinforce cane manufacturing infrastructure !, 
  i feel stupid . 
  i was like what ? 
  australia has a queen ? 
  googled , `` australian monarchy '' and just learned a lot . 
  she 's the queen of canada ? 
  i did n't even know they had queens . . til . 
  wow . 
  obama 's maximum terms have almost expired . . 
  the queen 's maximum years have almost expired . . man that 's a toughie . 
  competitive hide and go seek . 
  even if it does n't solve anything we all have a good time . 
  you * cooooould * join us as the 53rd tentative state . . 
  i want a queen again ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ cool of course if anyone named george gets back in charge we 'd have to kick you out as a matter of principle . 
  that 's encouraging to hear . 
  and of course you are correct on the second part . 
  there is nothing wrong with being any age or race combination , no one is able to choose their age or race and it 's quite silly to demonize folks for it . 
  the funny thing is by broadly stereotyping all * old and white * people as backwards and anti-progress is exactly what you 'd need to do to alienate them and get them to rally against your causes . 
  the message is so self-defeating . 
  it had that feeling about it , high-minded rhetoric , even with little knowledge of the facts . 
  though the nod to mp was still fun . 
  i appreciate your input , i 'm sure i 'll hear views from both sides in the coming weeks but so far all the other side has said sums up to * `` racist '' * , * `` white '' * , * `` old '' * , you pick the combo . 
  hard to empathize when i 'm not seeing any perspectives shared . 
  well that [ goes without saying . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9foi342lxqe&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=78 ) but i mean those 52 % do have a point , what has [ any european organization ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptfmay6m6aa&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=95 ) ever done for the british !, 
  the eu is no different !, 
  britishness must be preserved after all . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ honestly ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ real ^ ^ ^ ^ implications ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ uk ^ ^ ^ ^ leaving ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ eu ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ us ^ ^ ^ ^ political ^ ^ ^ ^ junkie ^ ^ ^ ^ following ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ news ^ ^ ^ ^ here ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ learn , ^ ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ hurt ^ ^ ^ ^ me , ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ ^ does n't ^ ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ monty ^ ^ ^ ^ python,
