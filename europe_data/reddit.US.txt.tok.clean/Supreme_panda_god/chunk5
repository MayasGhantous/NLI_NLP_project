  it 's all fun and games until someone starts rounding up minorities and putting them in camps . 
  god save us all . 
  i was n't going to saying anything till i read your flair , so here it goes : it is spelled ambassador . 
  thanks for learning english !, 
  under international law a refuged can not be prosecuted for illegally entering a country . 
  if they are not a refugee of course you can , but if they are you would have to violate people 's fudenmental right to seek asylum . 
  would you agree though if someone was a war refugee with some form of proof they should be given asylum ? 
  damn democrats trying to repeal the bush era tax cuts . 
  yes it is . 
  he made a false equivalency by making people think both candidates were equally bad . 
  yeah racists got mad that a black guy was more important than them . 
  thanks !, 
  also greenland has become glorious new beacon of danish culture . 
  probably be socially aware or share the pool with others ? 
  yep . 
  [ relevant polandball ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/6kfcp9/englishenglish/ ), 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8qyme.jpg ), 
  i love speaking american . 
  it 's fucking tire not tyre . 
  trains are a natural monopoly, 
  get out the guillotine, 
  it 's technically what if not xkcd, 
  it 's not that strong anymore . 
  fair enough . 
  quebec has french as the only official language ( the english provinces include french ) although at the national level canada does have english as well as french . 
  although french is the sole official language in tons of [ central african ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_territorial_entities_where_french_is_an_official_language?wprov=sfla1 ) nations . 
  and haiti 's other official language is a creole which has considerable french vocabulary . 
  when i was a kid i wondered if women could have jobs since ever tv show had the dad going to work . 
  then i remembered my mom was a doctor and my dad stayed home . 
  i also assumed babies were somehow the result of marriage since all show had 2 parent households . 
  he 's arguing everyone enslaved enemies and wiped peoples off the map so we should ignore it, 
  no other country except for belgium , switzerland , quebec , haiti , senegal , and algieria . 
  napoleon spread liberal values across europe , introduced the metric system to the wider world , and dreamed of a united europe . 
  tried to include lots of nationalities . 
  i was just trying to point out that people whose lives were shaped by wwii are still alive . 
  i think germany has acted extremely well since the war and has truly redeemed itself . 
  * keckles in jewish *, 
  my aunt who was sent to auschwitz is still alive . 
  i 'm pretty sure you could say she had something to do with the war . 
  not to say germans ca n't have some pride in their country . 
  jesus is the only person who needs to vote - orban, 
  there 's other parts of sweden ? 
  someone has to file the evil paperwork !, 
  hungary can not into sea port, 
  q majority ? 
  holy shit . 
  that 's lower than our turnout rate . 
  shit, 
  or a buddhist !, 
  estonia has more than twice as many people as my city, 
  i 'm just pointing out trump does n't always reward friendship and loyalty . 
  good thing trump has n't been involved in any scandals !, 
  lol . 
  more people died in my city last year than in died estonia for the past several years combined . 
  trump sure rewarded the first serious politician to endorse him chris christie ... 
  the state or the entire purchase ? 
  because i live in the purchase and want to declare a neo-french empire along the mississippi and have quebec and haiti join . 
  / r/retrofuturism, 
  * cries in american *, 
  i 'm an american , i 'm not going let anyone tell me what to do . 
  i did n't apologize . 
  in america teaching creationism is illegal under federal law . 
  i 'm not saying russia tipped the election ( although i believe putin tried to help trump ) . 
  james comey even swore under oath that russia tried to influence the election . 
  regardless trump has never critized putin and [ his son said most of their assets were in russia ] ( https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/politics/trump-says-he-has-nothing-to-do-with-russia-thirty-years-of-history-shows-otherwise/2017/01/11/b7f20c5a-d829-11e6-b8b2-cb5164beba6b_story.html#ampshare=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-has-nothing-to-do-with-russia-thirty-years-of-history-shows-otherwise/2017/01/11/b7f20c5a-d829-11e6-b8b2-cb5164beba6b_story.html ) . 
  is that not part of the russian federation at this point ? 
  when i said russia , i meant to include its territory in north america, 
  nah , just russia and the uk . 
  edit : the usa also has obviously gone to shit . 
  i just wanted to make a snide joke avout it being part of russia, 
  i agree . 
  i 'm just pointing out how recently it was criminalized in some states . 
  i believe straight anal sex might have been illegal , but i ca n't imagine non procreation sex ever being illegal . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm on mobile so i was really confused . 
  in the us sodomy was illegal in some states until 2003, 
  what map ? 
  in america we made william penn and lafayette honorary citizens only a few decades ago . 
  fake words, 
  i 'm not sure i would call the cartels terrorists , but the more i think about it they are . 
  when i meant europe i meant the eu . 
  i understand that the soviets were very oppressive . 
  my grandmother had a uncle who fled the hungary after the 1956 revolution . 
  what 's interesting about hungary is that it seems like many people were angry about the suppression of catholic institutions as well as economic oppression , but czechia is a very irreligious country . 
  i do n't think relations with russia and the west will improve until russia realizes the suffering they have caused others and apologize . 
  i would n't hold my breath . 
  that 's relieving to hear . 
  i 'm glad that europe has become a community of friends rather than bitter rivals . 
  just to be clear : i do n't doubt that those german speakers supported hitler . 
  however , i think the term ethnic cleansing is entirely appropriate . 
  ethnic cleansing is means trying to `` clean '' an area of a minority . 
  the language used by the government at the time does n't help your case much . 
  [ czechoslovak president edvard benes on october 28 , 1945 called for the `` final solution of the german question '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_germans_from_czechoslovakia?wprov=sfla1 ) i 'm not saying that it was n't justified , but it did happen . 
  there were germans living in the sudenten land . 
  hitler annexed the sudetten land and then all of czechoslovakia . 
  after the war was over all the german speaking people in the sudenten land were forced to leave . 
  edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expulsion_of_germans_from_czechoslovakia?wprov=sfla1, 
  i misspoke , my apologies . 
  they hate being called eastern european . 
  they had a peaceful break away from the eastern block in the velvet revolution and later peacefully split from czechoslovakia without a referendum .
