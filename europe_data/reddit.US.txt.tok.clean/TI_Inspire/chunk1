i would expect the lowest unemployment rate for a very large group of countries to have at least one country with an unemployment rate lower than 5 % . 
  people here in america still think our economy is terrible , meanwhile it would be one of the best performing economies in europe !, 
  i 'm not insulting europe in anyway if that what some people are thinking , i simply thought their economies would be performing better than what they currently doing . 
  no one is gon na support something when you tie it to the nazis . 
  and i thought the american economy was bad , but those unemployment rates are terrible . 
  the lowest unemployment is n't even below 5 % ? 
  i weep for you . 
  your whole premise is nonsense . 
  north african and middle eastern muslim states by and large have fertility rates at or near replacement . 
  i still feel that if i did in fact ever move to germany , that in order to really integrate and feel at home , that i 'd need to learn the language . 
  i 'm sure germany is lovely , however i 'm too stupid to learn the language . 
  seriously though . 
  south fl , where i live is at the same latitude as * western sahara * . 
  ac is simply a requirement unless you want to go insane . 
  are these unemployment numbers comparable to the numbers published by the united states ? 
  or are they complied differently ? 
  literally a modern day homestead act . 
  how much did finland export to russia before the embargo took effect ? 
  it feels odd knowing that a frenchman and a german wanting to communicate with each other are often using english to do so . 
  the current situation is already a catastrophe . 
  the russian people deserve better , though putin still looks impervious at this point . 
  amen, 
   every time i 've had to go to bern , zurich , or geneva they seem more like expensive getaways for wealthy germans , italians , and french than anything else . 
  switzerland does n't fit the clean and squeaky definition of a nation-state . 
  it 's more than likely that those wealthy individuals you saw were actually native to the area . 
  after all , the german , french , and italian languages are all native within their own specific regions of the country . 
  * taxes and other revenues collected by the national government * country | tax revenue as a percentage of gdp --------- | ---------- usa | 22 % sweden | 51.8 % now of course it 's important to keep note that sweden has a unitary system as opposed to the american federal system , so these numbers are not quite as radically different in practice because state and local governments tax independently in the us . 
  i doubt that if included however , it would get anywhere near the enormous 51.8 % figure for sweden . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2221.html#sw ), 
  i 'm going to go out on a limb here and say that since the index seriously states that * poland * has achieved the same living standards as the * united states * , that it 's probably wrong . 
  unless you can prove that making protitution illegal would reduce human trafficking , i do n't see how making it illegal would be beneficial . 
  unless some politician wanted to take advantage of the moral high ground , of course . 
  i was unaware , my b. 
  i know not his intentions , i was simply raising a possible option . 
  that would of course require our government to take advantage of the opportunities delivered right to their laps ... 
  if we were to install a medicare for all program in the us and expand the visa quotas , we would be swamped with educated europeans making the jump . 
  yeah i agree , it most definitely can be difficult . 
  i 'm not sure about what place would be best for a young engineer , however i know that the unemployment is pretty low ( 4.9 % overall ; 10.3 % youth ) and is decreasing . 
  overall i would suspect that a trained engineer would be able to quickly find employment in the states . 
  of course the migration process would be more difficult then moving to another eu country , so it does make sense to consider germany and denmark first . 
  you could always move to america too , you know . 
  how does the government plan to reduce the trade deficit ? 
  tax incentives for producers ? 
  currency devaluation ? 
  [ also , i 'm not really sure if the trade deficit is something the uk really should be worrying about .

  is there anything in particular causing the uk to grow so strongly ? 
  while that is true , american industrial practices of the era were far more efficient at producing significant amount of vehicles of war than any other belligerent of the war . 
  this was due to wide spread adoption of simplified mass production techniques in american factories unlike anything seen in the rest of the world up to that point . 
  for instance , the german government , realizing the inherent american manufacturing advantage as the war progressed , tried to implement large scale mass production ( as opposed to their wide spread usage of archaic craft production techniques ) . 
  however in trying to do this , they faced significant push back from their skilled manufacturing labor who saw this as an attempt by their government to reduce their value . 
  such labor push back was a significant reason why the nazis banned labor unions during the war . 
  regardless , the germans were never able to implement more efficient american manufacturing techniques fully during the duration of the war . 
  though they did try .

  the germans spend less on their military than what americans spend on their pets . 
  ok i digress , good point . 
  why on earth would it not ? 
  those costs also i believe include the expected inflation over the duration of the program . 
  what would that imply though ? 
  as it is quite difficult to create an environment where high wage jobs are plentiful . 
  personally i 'm not sure , but it 'd probably ( guessing here ) be a lot more comparable to the lower levels of inequality seen in many european countries . 
  well when you have stock market exchanges so large that they encompass the [ majority of the world 's market cap ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-map-of-the-world-if-size-was-determined-by-market-cap-2015-08-12 ) . 
  along with a system that transfers far less to those at the bottom of the social economic totem pole ; then statistics like this are entirely inevitable . 
  another day , another discussion about how europe is headed for geopolitical destitution . 
  brilliant !, 
  * yawns * germany , the united kingdom and france ( with the fourth , fifth and sixth largest economies , respectably ) will remain great powers indefinitely , with the ability to throw their considerable power at what they see fit . 
  whether it be via influencing the broader eu to their own personal benefit , or using their militaries with great effect . 
  these three great powers will remain as such throughout the 21st century . 
  it is impossible to understate how the divisions between countries within the eu have exacerbated the migration/refugee crisis . 
  coordinating policy on any issue between the numerous eu members is always going to be difficult ; but for the controversial issue of immigration ? 
  it 's simply impossible . 
  [ the mississippi river watershed combined with the intracoastal waterway is the largest system of interconnected waterways on the planet by far ] ( http://www.captainjohn.org/images/waterways-map.jpg ) . 
  considering these waterways overlay some of the best farmland on the planet , you should n't be surprised that the united states ranks [ # 1 in food exports ] ( https://gyazo.com/f9e9198486b9c74de8b5b27eddd77139 ) . 
  also we generally have a more favorable environment for innovating entrepreneurs ( less regulations than the eu ) , combine this with the fact that the united states has [ 16 of the top 20 universities worldwide ] ( https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2015/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25 ) , and it also should be expected that the united states has [ 8 of the 15 largest tech companies , of which the eu has 0 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_information_technology_companies ) . 
  admittedly we here in the us definitely have issues to deal with ( expensive health care and tertiary education ) , but we do a lot of things well and we have a lot of things to be thankful for . 
   you guys impeached your president for lying about a blow job . 
  i mean , i know the core of that might not have been religious , but it was puritanical even if it was used as a maneuver or sorts . 
  bill clinton was not impeached for receiving a blow job , rather , he was impeached for lying about it . 
  ( he denied it at first ), 
  i feel as if most of the current problems for our healthcare system could simply be solved if we largely expanded medicaid ( even more than what the aca did ) . 
  i 'd like to see it grow to the point where most major things are covered ( it currently does n't cover things like prescriptions or eye care ) , and so that all unemployed , underemployed , and low wage workers who could n't get good enough insurance that meet certain predetermined government standards from their employer are covered . 
  of course that is far from the only thing that should be reworked , however a much larger medicaid system is desperately needed . 
  no , you have to keep in mind that euros are worth more than usd, 
  one should n't measure the relative cost of health care systems as ( nhe/gdp ) . 
  this is because gdp can be heavily influenced by other factors other than the actual ability of civilians to consume . 
  factors that may boost gdp without reflecting an actual increase in the standard of living of civilians may include things like high levels of investment , high net exports , and high government spending . 
  instead , relative spending levels should be measured as ( nhe/aic ) . 
  aic being [ * actual individual consumption * ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/glossary:actual_individual_consumption_%28aic%29 ) . 
   actual individual consumption , abbreviated as aic , refers to all goods and services actually consumed by households . 
  it encompasses consumer goods and services purchased directly by households , as well as services provided by non-profit institutions and the government for individual consumption ( e.g. , health and education services ) . 
  in international comparisons , the term is usually preferred over the narrower concept of household consumption , because the latter is influenced by the extent to which non-profit institutions and general government act as service providers . 
  essentially , aic per capita is a better measure at determining the wealth of country 's citizens than gdp per capita . 
  and when we look at the aic per capita by country , [ we find that the us ranks far and away number 1 . 
  ] ( https://randomcriticalanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screenshot_8921.png ) taking this into account , the us actually does n't appear to be an outlier in [ health spending .
