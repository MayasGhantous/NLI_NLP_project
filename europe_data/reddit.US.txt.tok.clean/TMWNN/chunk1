yup - hardly anyone here in america understand this tremendously important fact . 
  i do n't know about the women , but italian young men like living with their parents because this way they can lean outside their upstairs room 's window wearing a wife beater .

  in addition to / u/kar86 's answer , brussels was selected because it , while a reasonably large city ( and being the eu 's headquarters has further enlarged it ) , is * not * on the scale of london/paris/frankfurt / rome . 
  similarly , belgium is a small country ; that is , it is not the uk/france/germany / italy . 
  in other words , choosing it as the capital of the eu did not make other cities or countries jealous . 
  from the op-ed , describing his experiences at the london university . 
   but the longer i spent on campus , the more i noticed strange occurrences and remarks that seemed to fit with an islamist ideology . 
  eventually , i realized , these ideas were deeply ingrained at westminster , allowing individuals to feel comfortable advocating dangerous and discriminatory beliefs . 
   i recall a seminar discussion about immanuel kant 's `` democratic peace theory , '' in which a student wearing a niqab opposed the idea on the grounds that `` as a muslim , i do n't believe in democracy . '' our instructor seemed astonished but did not question the basis of her argument ; he simply moved on . 
  i was perplexed , though . 
  why attend university if you have such a strict belief system that you are unwilling to consider new ideas ? 
  and why had n't the instructor challenged her ? 
  at the time , i dismissed her statement as one person 's outlandish opinion . 
  later , i realized that her extreme religious views were prevalent within the institution . 
  [ ... ]  from my experiences , i believe that the university is unwittingly complicit in perpetuating such radicalization , as it has often allowed islamist extremism to go unchallenged . 
  i do n't think the university itself is advocating extremism , but by failing to prevent the advocacy of such ideas , the institution is attracting students who are sympathetic to them . 
  students who do not identify with extreme islamist ideology are being put at risk of discrimination , intimidation and potentially radicalization by the university 's failure to properly handle the situation . 
  britain has lots of russian-speaking diplomats . 
  if history is any precedent , though , they 're all [ russian spies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambridge_five ) . 
   hitler was just a figurehead , so there would have been a nazi party and it would have had about the same values . 
  i would n't call him a figurehead . 
  national socialism was just one of many small extremist parties on either end of the political spectrum in post-wwi germany . 
  even with hitler it remained obscure until making a political breakthrough when the solid economic recovery that began after the german economy stabilized with the [ rentenmark ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_rentenmark ) stalled during the depression . 
  without him , there is no reason to think that it would have emerged from the pack of rival far-right parties . 
  even had it done so the odds are against a hitlerless nazi party in power pursuing genocide and world war as aggressively as hitler did . 
  people forget that germany was only one of many european countries with various forms of authoritarian/fascist governments , many of which ( italy , austria , hungary ) came to power before the nazis , and none of which sought to start a large-scale war by itself . 
  a hitlerless nazi germany might very well have sought to reclaim the rhineland , and maybe the suedetenland . 
  while probably anti-semitic , it might have been `` passively '' so or even actively avoid the issue the way mussolini 's national fascist party did , and large incidents on the scale of * krystallnacht * are extremely unlikely ; it is likely that such a party would have , like similar parties elsewhere , had some jewish support . 
  it probably would not have sought general european hegemony through war -- as the 20th century proved , all germany needs to do that is peacetime -- and ** certainly ** would not have aggressively sought * lebensraum * in the east by killing millions of slavs . 
  / u/okiedokie321 is being sarcastic . 
  he probably should have said `` reddit '' instead of `` western '' , but his point is that according to the usual online 19-year old circlejerks which reddit epitomizes , the us is perpetually on the verge of bankruptcy/war/mass epidemics/societal collapse/etc . , etc. 
  ( yet strangely never does so ) . 
  meanwhile , scandinavia -- a region that is ( other than norway , with its oil ) [ significantly poorer than the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gni_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) -- is usually described by the same basement dwellers as heaven on earth , and canada is often described by them as being scandinavia in north america despite being 95 % identical to its southern neighbor . 
  is n't the 80-90 % acceptance rate for syrians , iraqis , and eritreans a gigantic incentive for further migration from those countries ? 
  one of the wealthiest countries in the world is basically telling residents of three very poor countries , `` if you can make it here , ** you are almost guaranteed to receive asylum ** . '', 
  posted two months ago by / u/jakubmarian , the creator , but received no attention . 
  its relevance has grown with recent events . 
   while alcohol is a big enough part of the social scene here , it is not anymore prevalent than in eastern europe and we are not the raging alcoholics portrayed by the stereotype . 
  yes , but what other nation has had alcohol play such a key role in its history ? 
  ireland was once the world 's most advanced civilization . 
  [ until its inhabitants made a new discovery ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6twaz55bqw#t=25s ), 
   when i went to the bundeswehr , people who knew me since elementary asked me if i went insane or why i wanted to kill people . 
  some even stopped talking to me for some months . 
  conscription only ended in germany in 2010 . 
  surely -- given the universal service -- conscripts were n't routinely mocked as `` killers '' before then ? 
  from the article :  there were more than 1,000 newly recorded cases of female genital mutilation ( fgm ) in england between april and june , nhs data reveals . 
   for the first time the official figures were expanded to include information from general practices and mental health trusts . 
   they show nine cases where girls were under 18 when first seen . 
   fgm is illegal across the uk and it is illegal to take someone abroad for this purpose . 
  so serbians can no longer visit croatia to speak serbo-croatian with croatians ? 
  [ the incident / u/my _ baby_ate_dingos mentioned ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/qatar/11503669/asian-labourers-press-ganged-into-joining-qatar-marathon-record-attempt.html ) :  however , participants were surprised to see large numbers of other `` competitors '' , mostly of south asian appearance , were running without proper kit . 
  some were wearing jeans and flip-flops . 
   some tried to drop out but , according to one witness , were ordered to keep running . 
  having read the article , it 's not clear that the general is talking about an actual , formal mutiny or coup d'etat :  there would be mass resignations at all levels and you would face the very real prospect of an event which would effectively be a mutiny . 
  a '' [ revolt of the admirals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolt_of_the_admirals ) '' occurred in the us navy in 1949 ; it was a ( very ) public disagreement with government policy , that 's all . 
  not necessarily .

  one clear positive result from the refugee crisis : the number of rare pepes is increasing , relieving the shortage . 
   although it would probably just be jealousy , it would n't stop british people moving to a certain part of the uk . 
  750k scottish born live in england and it only has a population of 5.3 million . 
  that 's what makes no sense about scotland 's independence movement : its stated belief that an independent scotland would * continue to use the british pound ( problematic from both its presumptuousness , and the implication an independent scotland would hand over its monetary policy to the boe ) * get automatic membership in the eu * automatically keep open borders with england * spend nothing on defense while , implicitly , expecting england to defend it this is * not * the same thing as saying that an independent scotland is unviable ; ireland is one of many eu nations that are scotland 's size or smaller . 
  the assumptions the campaign makes are , however , questionable . 
   are you british living in us yourself ? 
  no ; an american who follows british affairs . 
  i sometimes post on / r/ukpolitics . 
  good point . 
  i 've written before about [ the north/south split in england ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3caw5j/devolution_movements_in_england_1000x1000_oc/csumurq?context=3 ) ; in addition , scotland hates/resents/envies england in a way that has no parallel in the us . 
  even in canada , there is [ a full-fledged dislike of toronto by the rest of the country ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/362frf/subjective_map_of_alberta_1668_x_843/crakc0k?context=3 ) ( and , to a lesser extent , vice versa ) that would amaze visiting americans . 
   every country wants europe to have a silicon valley , but it wants it in its own borders . 
  the us has 300m people and 1 silicon valley - europe has 500m and at least 20 silicon valley wannabees , an average of 1 silicon valley hopeful per 25m people . 
  indeed , every developed and developing country on earth has an area that it subsidizes in hopes of making it the next silicon valley . 
  no government program , however , caused the area between san francisco and san jose to become the world 's center of computer technology ; rather , a serendipitous combination of top nearby universities , large tracts of available land , and automobile garages that could be used as the first `` office '' of a new business . 
  even with these factors there was no guarantee that silicon valley would emerge as the leader . 
  from the 1950s to 1970s the us computer industry was largely centered around [ route 128 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massachusetts_route_128#the_high-tech_region ) in boston . 
  of the three most important early microcomputer companies , only apple was based in silicon valley ; tandy was in fort worth and commodore in pennsylvania . 
  route 128 remained as important as silicon valley into the late 1980s , when an overreliance on minicomputers caused it to fall behind , but it remains an important secondary area , like seattle and the texas triangle . 
  as you imply , europe is going to have to accept that it 's counterproductive to have more than one or two main tech centers on the continent , with other areas being secondary . 
  although of course massachusetts and texas and washington state want their tech centers to succeed , they do not see the existence of silicon valley as a threat to themselves because , after all , they are all part of the same country . 
  would germany and france ever see the clear emergence of ( say ) the cambridge region of england as `` europe 's silicon valley '' so benignly ? 
  i doubt it . 
  it 's possible to walk from the southern tip of italy to the western shore of portugal , with the residents of every village [ able to communicate with those of the next one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialect_continuum#romance_languages ) . 
   where do you get these ideas from ? 
  i would really like to know . 
  from reddit , of course . 
  this well-known haven of intellectualism constantly repeats to ~ ~ redditards ~ ~ redditors that : * the us is a hellhole where the plutocratic rich whip the masses of poor for sport in the streets , as opposed to being the country with the world 's [ fourth-highest median income ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income#oecd_statistics ) * texas is a hellhole run by oil companies that people desperately flee from , as opposed to being the state consistently attracting the most migrants from elsewhere in the us * the southern us is a hellhole that routinely lynches gays , blacks , and anyone who is not a redneck white for fun , as opposed to being the fastest-growing region etc. , etc. 
  the fact that / u/jeff3412 had to write :  i 'm pretty sure the us is not killing gay people or interracial couples for dishonoring their families . 
  says a lot about mental defectives like / u/snokus and his legions of fellow idiots , whether european or american . 
  as / u/grumbal and / u/stansucks pointed out , the percentages are -- as i said -- very different . 
  any civilized society can , over time , likely integrate almost any culture that comprises 1 % of the population . 
  the odds go down significantly if said culture a ) comprises a much larger percentage , b ) holds very different values and standards , and c ) arrives in a very short period of time . 
  western europe has had a lot of trouble with its islamic population because of a ) and b ) , and is now experiencing c ) as well . 
  muslims in the us , for reasons i mentioned , do not have the reputation for poverty , ghettoism , and general social dysfunction that they do in western europe ( which those such as / u/irishguy317 and / u/laslpalp allude to ) .
