  other than the whole `` living in the movies '' feeling , how did you like living in the us ? 
  the usual path would be for / u/mkvgtired 's friend to attend a us law school , possibly for a one-year [ ll.m . 
  degree ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/master_of_laws#programs_for_foreign_legal_graduates ) . 
  this would qualify her to , as / u/yeswesodacan mentioned , take the bar exam in many us states . 
  as a bonus , doing so would give her access to the law school 's career network ; she would be able to interview with law firms that recruit from the school . 
  the us has a much smaller percentage of muslims than european countries , and because of its distance from majority-islamic nations has historically attracted better-educated ones . 
  america , thank god , does not have any muslim ghettos of the type that exist in every major western european country . 
  our existing ghettos are enough ; i hope that we never get our own * [ banlieus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banlieu ) * . 
  indeed , germans and americans are [ the world 's most and third-most productive workers per hour of work ] ( http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/which-country-has-the-most-productive-workers.html ) . 
  ( in # 2 are , surprisingly , the french . ), 
  the us is also # 3 when measuring [ ppp-adjusted gdp per hour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_hour_worked ) ( norway is # 1 ) , while germany is # 5 . 
   i think she would like it in chicago , but i think she needs to make an effort to try to figure out what life is like here , not just a vacation . 
  i imagine that the sights and sounds of one of the world 's greatest cities -- the center of a metro area that has twice as many people as her home country -- must be entrancing to her . 
  we americans take for granted that 1 ) we are # 1 , and 2 ) anytime we want we can move to chicago , nyc , or la , one of our eight [ alpha cities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_city#alpha.2b.2b ) ; in europe only germany has more than one . 
  finnish is unlike any other european language ; it 's likely that your friend speaks much better english than swedish or german . 
  she may very well have decided that , if she is going to make the leap of moving , why not to the country with the biggest economy with the language she knows best ? 
   i met a finnish attorney on a previous trip . 
  her dream is to move to chicago and practice us law . 
  it 's certainly not unrealistic or implausible for an educated professional who is ( presumably ) english speaking to move to the us . 
  there are 22,902 finland-born people living in the us ; that 's more than the number in france , italy , britain , ireland , and the netherlands combined . 
  to put another way , four out of every 1000 finns live in the us . 
  ( there are 2,903 american-born people living in finland ; since the us 's population is 59 times larger than finland 's , that means that a finn is about 450 times ( ! ), 
  more likely to move to the us than an american is to go the other way . ), 
  all data comes from [ migration drc ] ( http://www.migrationdrc.org/research/typesofmigration/global_migrant_origin_database.html ) ; see table 4 .

  and earlier  so i 'm a us citizen .

  it 's pretty obvious that he a ) ran away from ( almost certainly ) financial trouble and b ) moved to europe thinking , as so many people on and off reddit do , that it is a socialist paradise where no one has to pay anything to live like kings because `` the government '' pays for everything . 
  now , imagine what hundreds of millions of impoverished in the middle east and africa think when they see images of wealthy westerners on their smartphones , ** and suddenly hear that one of their most important leaders is welcoming them ** . 
  from the article :  after complaints by local authorities that they were overwhelmed by the newcomers , germany suddenly announced sunday that it would impose border checks to stem a tide of migrants to munich , where most taking the so-called balkan route to germany arrived first . 
   the same night , state leader horst seehofer let it slip that oktoberfest -- now in its 182nd year -- had also been on his mind when he pushed for the policy change less than a week before the first keg was to be tapped . 
   `` i asked today for appropriate measures to be taken during the two weeks of oktoberfest so that munich does not remain the first port of call that it now is , '' said seehofer , a party ally of chancellor angela merkel 's who has sparred with her on the refugees issue . 
   all 3 became very angry and said that oktoberfest is offensive and intolerant towards muslims . 
  wait . 
  this actually happens in germany ?!? 
  i thought it was just a joke about what * would * happen if germany let the hordes of refugees/illegals in . 
  yet more proof that reddit reflects real life, 
  invade austria and other bordering countries for * lebensraum * , of course , based on prior european precedent . 
   it 's odd how the immigrants in europe feel entitled to so many things while the immigrants in the us quietly work their asses off hoping to maybe become a citizen in a decade or two . 
  good point . 
  there is a well-known phenomenon in many american cities of groups of men , usually of latin american background , gathering on certain street corners and the parking lots of home-improvement stores.people who , say , need a handyman to do some repair work around the home drive up , hire one , and leave , as if buying a takeout dinner . 
  they are usually paid in cash and it is assumed that the latins are usually illegal immigrants , as if they were here legally they would probably be on a construction site making more money . 
  nonetheless , there is always demand for their services as they have a reputation for hard work ; for europeans , think of the way the `` polish plumber '' is seen in your country . 
  europeans , does anything like that happen in your country ? 
  have * any * of the african/middle eastern illegal immigrants/refugees gained a similar reputation for hard work ?

   if you have your driver 's license you should be okay . 
  based on the precedent in the us , within a few years there will be demands that refugees and illegal immigrants receive driver 's licenses , because `` they 're going to drive with or without one '' so the thing to do , of course , is to legalize illegality . 
  * sigh *, 
  do n't forget how they are all well-educated doctors and engineers !, 
   germany also lost colonies . 
  so did all the european colonizers . 
  / u/adlerchen is right , though . 
  colonies like vietnam are one thing , but algeria was as integral a part of france as alaska or hawaii is to the us , or all of ireland was to the uk , or east prussia was to germany .

   that attraction is compounded by myths and exaggerations about life in europe - free cars/homes/education , nobody has to work , tons of gorgeous women who ca n't get enough sex , etc.

  you ignored / u/rndmnck 's point about ( unless lots of americans are faking flairs here ) the identical talk in / r/europe about the impending doom of germany , sweden , and europe overall from the refugees . 
  that is my experience as well ; if he had n't replied saying so i would have . 
   except the question is asking which countries do europeans want to live in . 
  again , the migration drc data has answers . 
  there are two ways to consider this : * one way is to compare the number of immigrants the us and canada receive from the same european countries . 
  there are 191,148 german-born people , 7,726 from sweden , and 6,505 from norway living in canada , while 1.2 million germans ( about six times larger ) , 54,000 swedes ( about seven times ) , and 36,000 norwegians ( about 5.5 times ) are in the us . 
  given that the us 's population is nine times larger than canada 's , the figures are indeed ( slightly ) higher proportionately for canada . 
  * another way is to again consider relative reciprocal population flow . 
  there are only 150,000 american-born people living in germany , although the us has four times germany 's population . 
  sweden and norway ? 
  15,000 americans in each , compared to 54,000 swedes and 36,000 norwegians in the us . 
  sweden has 10 million people -- the size of los angeles county -- so there would have to be 1.62 million americans living there to match those going the other way on a per-capita basis . 
  to put in other terms , it is 24 times more likely for a german to move to the us than for an american to move the other way , 100 times ( ! ),
