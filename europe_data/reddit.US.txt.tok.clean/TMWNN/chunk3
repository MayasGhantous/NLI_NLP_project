  more likely for a swede , and 60 times for a norwegian . 
  there are 27,177 canadian-born in germany . 
  since germany 's population is 2.25 times larger , there would have to be 61,640 canadians in germany to match the 191,148 germans in canada ( or , 84,955 germans in canada to match the 27,177 canadians in germany ) for the two flows to be proportionately equal . 
  this implies that a german is three times more likely to move to canada than a canadian is to move to germany ; compare this to the aforementioned 24 times for germany -  us versus us -  germany per capita . 
  similarly , given the 2,471 canadians in sweden and 2,296 in norway , and canada 's population being 3.5 times that of sweden and seven times that of norway , the data implies that a swede is about 11 times more likely to move to canada than for a canadian to go the other way , and that a norwegian is about 20 times more likely . 
  again , compare to the 100 times greater odds of sweden -  us versus us -  sweden . 
  conclusions : * by one metric the us seems much more attractive to germans , swedes , and norwegians than canada when compared to reciprocal population flow ; by another , canada has a slight edge . 
  * germans , swedes , and norwegians are all much , much more likely to move to the us or canada than for americans or canadians to go the other way . 
  * canadians are much , much more likely to move to the us ( as likely as germans on a per-capita basis ) than for americans to move to canada . 
   i 'm worried that many of these people think sweden as some sort of utopia . 
  many will be disappointed when they realize it 's very , very hard to find an apartment in the big cities and a large part of the population are struggling to find a job , especially young people .

   i seriously doubt that the us would be in the top 7 , maybe even the top ten . 
  of course fewer europeans migrate to the us than in the 19th and early 20th centuries , or compared to latin american countries today , but they still come and the net flows are still considerably in the us 's favor . 
  there are 1.2 million german-born people living in the us , for example , versus only 150,000 american-born people living in germany , although the us has four times germany 's population . 
  sweden and norway ? 
  15,000 americans in each , compared to 54,000 swedes and 36,000 norwegians in the us . 
  sweden has 10 million people -- the size of los angeles county -- so there would have to be 1.62 million americans living there to match those going the other way on a per-capita basis . 
  similarly , there are 824,000 britons living in the us , compared to 159,000 americans living in britain . 
  given that the us 's population is about five times that of britain 's , that means that on a per-capita basis a briton is ** 25 times ** more likely to move to the us than an american is to move to britain . 
  same with non-european countries . 
  945,000 canadians in the us versus 279,000 americans in canada despite the us being nine times larger . 
  since the us 's population is nine times that of canada 's , on a per-capita basis a canadian is 27 times more likely to move to the us than the other way around . 
  yes , the us has a nicer climate than canada , but this is consistent with other anglosphere countries ; 75,000 australians and 26,000 new zealanders are in the us compared to 54,000 americans in australia and 13,000 in new zealand , respectively , so on a per-capita basis australians are about 20 times more likely to move to the us and new zealanders an amazing 140 times .

  sorry to disappoint you , but canadians themselves disagree .

   you mean pakistanis ?

  that 's exactly / u/logicbeatsemotion and / u/7hr0wawayaccount and / u/hbucket 's point .

   we really need to do something to counter the unrealistic expectations these people have about europe and its asylum system ... 
  these people will get shipped to sweden and sweden will then try to ship these people to a rural area so as to not make their ghetto problem worse .

  english translation via google translate , with my highlights :  ** duisburg : nrw police warns against lawless spaces **  intimidation , threats , violence : in a confidential analysis the duisburg police warned by spiegel information available no-go areas . 
  the public order was `` acute danger '' . 
   the north rhine-westphalian police fear the emergence of lawless spaces in urban areas . 
  as is apparent from a confidential paper the duisburg bureau , the state power threatens the control of problem areas of the city to be slipping away . 
  the duty of the police to maintain public order is , `` long-term non-secured '' in certain localities and `` acute danger '' reads by spiegel information in the analysis . 
   ** there were districts where already complained gangs entire streets for themselves . 
  residents and business people are being intimidated and remained silent out of fear . 
  tram lines would take people in evening and night `` as anxiety dreams come true '' . 
  policemen and especially female officers would face a `` high aggressiveness and disrespect '' against . 
  **  in the medium term will be to be able also to change anything , according to the report . 
  on the downside , inter alia , the high level of unemployment , the prospects of immigrants without qualifications for the german labor market and ethnic tensions among migrants contrary . 
  the duisburg police now wants to reinforce its presence on the street and track offenders more consistently . 
   `` 40 or 50 men on the cheek ''  hearing experts advise for some time before that problem neighborhoods could become no-go areas . 
  the federal president of the german police union ( dpolg ) , rainer wendt , told spiegel online years ago : ** `` in berlin or in the north of duisburg there are neighborhoods where colleagues hardly dare to stop a car - because they know that they 'll have 40 or 50 men on the cheek . 
  '' ** these attacks were almost `` a targeted test of strength with the state in which the contempt of expressing offenders in our society '' . 
   only earlier this month had members of an extended family in duisburg-marxloh attacked and injured two policemen . 
  the attack was the inclusion of a traffic accident preceded , during which the officials were quickly surrounded by dozens of men . 
  a spokesman for the interior ministry in d\u00fcsseldorf said after the incident , there is no no-go areas in north rhine-westphalia . 
   the gangs meet in practice , often on a much overworked police . 
  so described a duisburg watchkeeping director some time ago in a letter to his police president the situation on the road . 
  it said : ** `` show strength is impossible situations in areas with high numbers of migrant slipping more and more . . '' ** for there the police will not be accepted especially by the young people . 
  the risk for the officials to be attacked , also because should always be used because of the `` catastrophic personnel situation '' with a minimum of forces ascend .

  from the article :  attempts to build a multicultural society in germany have `` utterly failed '' , chancellor angela merkel says . 
   she said the so-called `` multikulti '' concept - where people would `` live side-by-side '' happily - did not work , and immigrants needed to do more to integrate - including learning german . 
  [ ... ]  mrs merkel told a gathering of younger members of her conservative christian democratic union ( cdu ) party on saturday that at `` the beginning of the 60s our country called the foreign workers to come to germany and now they live in our country . '', 
   she added : `` we kidded ourselves a while , we said : ` they wo n't stay , sometime they will be gone ' , but this is n't reality . '', 
   `` and of course , the approach [ to build ] a multicultural [ society ] and to live side-by-side and to enjoy each other ... has failed , utterly failed . '',
