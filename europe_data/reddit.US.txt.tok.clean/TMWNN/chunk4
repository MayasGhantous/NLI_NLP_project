  from the article :  berlin -- a surge in xenophobic attacks and hate speech targeting asylum seekers in germany is igniting a firestorm in the nation where the nazis taught the dangers of intolerance . 
   prominent personalities have condemned the attacks as well as a recent rash of public vitriol on social media and elsewhere . 
  anja reschke , an anchorwoman for german public broadcaster ard , for instance , touched off a national debate after an on-air commentary blasting refugee bashing . 
  soon after airing , the segment went viral , with 15 million hits and counting . 
   in it , reschke bluntly said what many others here have feared to -- condemning the haters as well as calling out those germans who have remained silent . 
  to make her point , she used the terminology of the nazi era , earning a bravo from some while angering others .

   i do n't know what to say . 
  indeed . 
  for all the criticism of merkel , at least germany has [ income and language requirements ] ( https://www.justlanded.com/english/germany/germany-guide/visas-permits/citizenship ) for citizenship . 
  and , according to / u/idraga , swedish citizenship is n't needed to vote in local elections ?!? 
  ( does this mean any refugee/migrant can immediately start voting ? ), 
  the mind reels . 
  / u/idraga , i think / r/europe would be very interested in a post by you on swedish citizenship requirements ( such as they are ) and the right to vote in local elections without citizenship . 
  i 'm sure others will be as amazed as we are . 
  from the article :  4:30 p.m.  sweden 's prime minister says preliminary estimates indicate more than 150,000 asylum seekers will arrive in the country this year . 
   stefan lofven said friday nearly 9,000 people have sought asylum in sweden in the past seven days alone and the country is preparing for a crisis situation . 
  from the article :  one of seaside plaza 's key attractions is that it is next to the heliport , where helicopters shuttle british businessmen along the coast to nice airport in a mere seven minutes . 
   the crucial tax loophole , dating from the steamship age , allows non-residents 90 days a year in britain , plus the day of travel out and the day of travel back . 
  this means businessmen can fly in on monday morning , work four days , fly out on thursday night , and do this for most weeks in the year without breaking the rules . 
  [ ... ]  the tax authorities have also allowed non-residents , since 1993 , to keep a uk house without losing their status .

  ireland was once the world 's most advanced civilization .

  the * lander * are very different from the prewar systems : * the nazis more or less abolished the states , implementing the gauletier system . 
  * most of the states do not have real links with prewar entities , and almost all boundaries are changed . 
  * there is , of course , no current equivalent to prussia 's dominance . 
  * the constitutional division of power between the states and berlin are different . 
  etc. , etc. 
  in retrospect i should not have written `` forced '' ; `` implemented '' would have been preferable . 
  that said , there is no doubt of the total and complete lack of continuity between the basic law and the imperial or weimar/nazi constitutions . 
  as i said , had the us and uk decided that germany should , like japan , have a unitary state , it would have had a unitary state regardless of germans ' wishes or prewar precedent . 
   norway ( which is probably richer simply because of oil money ) . 
  there 's no question that it 's oil that makes norway so wealthy . 
  there is no other way to explain why it is [ 50 % wealthier per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gni_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) than fellow scandinavian countries sweden and denmark , and even more so than iceland and finland .

  the poster deleted it after people mocked its pretentious/provocative legend ( `` very repressive laws '' , etc. 
  ) , but i would advise readers to ignore the labeling and consider the map itself , and how it displays the way the developed world has built fortifications to separate itself from the rest . 
  whether you think that is a good thing or not , the fact remains that they exist . 
  i am well aware that the german * lander * are based in large part on historical kingdoms and boundaries , and that until 1870 germany had a new petty princedom every ten miles . 
  that does n't change the fact that in 1945 there was no guarantee whatsoever that postwar germany would be a federal state . 
  had the allies preferred a unitary state ( perhaps because of a belief that it would be more effective in any military confrontation with the ussr ) , one in which the * lander * have little power , that is what their representatives would have instructed the basic law 's drafters to write . 
   germany , for example , has many large cities -- hamburg , munich , the rhein-rhur area , berlin , nuremberg , stuttgart , etc. 
  yes , germany is a great example of what i am talking about . 
  german cities have their own strengths ( frankfurt for finance , stuttgart for automobiles , hamburg for shipping , etc. 
  ) , but the top five are roughly equal . 
  a briton , if he wishes to be very successful in his field , * must * move to london with very few exceptions . 
   it 's mostly historic , you ca n't undo a millenium of centralism vs. decentralism . 
  it can be done , over time . 
  ( germans ought to thank the british and americans every day for forcing a federal system onto them . ), 
  if england is n't federalized , any english parliament absolutely , positively must be located outside london . 
   my initial plan was to live here maybe for half a year or a year , simply to experience something different . 
  turns out that i really like it here . 
  translation for / u/coolwhater and / u/s4embakla2ckle1 : `` i met a girl . '', 
  in england , `` the north '' ( of an imaginary line drawn roughly at the [ severn wash ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/severn_wash ) ) is seen as poor and `` the south '' is seen as rich , and the north is indeed much poorer than the south . 
  in 1964 , the oxford union debated '' [ when going north , wogs begin at barnet ] ( http://books.google.com/books?id=fgi3bgy54occ&amp;lpg=pa15&amp;pg=pa15#v=onepage&amp;f=false ) '' ; while humorous , of course , it was based on a real perception in `` the south '' of `` the north '' . 
  this is very different from in the us , where new yorkers might similarly call [ anything west of the hudson river ] ( http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/steinberg-newyorker.jpg ) `` rural '' or `` the west '' , but , generally speaking , would n't make the distinction based on a perceived wealth gap . 
  i 've made this point elsewhere . 
  [ quoting myself ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1eymi7/number_of_cities_larger_than_the_capital1425x761oc/ca579as?context=3 ) : -- consider the us 's [ 10 largest metro areas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_states_metropolitan_areas ) : in order , nyc ( ~ 7 % of the total us population ) , la ( ~ 5 % ) , chicago ( 3 % ) , dc , san francisco bay area , boston , philly , dallas , miami , and houston . 
  they comprise one third of the country 's population and the list is overall a very balanced one : * 3 in the northeast , 1 in the mid-atlantic , 1 in the southeast , 1 in the midwest , 2 in tx , 2 on the west coast * 5 in the sunbelt , 5 not * 5 on the east coast , 5 not * 5 on the east coast , 2 on the west coast , 3 in between etc. , etc. 
  now , consider this [ map of the uk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom#demographics ) and this [ list of the largest uk urban areas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom#demographics ) . 
  note how , other than london , only three ( bristol , southampton , and portsmouth ) are below the severn wash line . 
  greater london is gigantic , relatively speaking , compared to its us counterparts -- 13 % of the entire country 's population ( ! ), 
  -- and has no national peers the way la and chicago are real rivals to nyc . 
  this causes a huge imbalance , wherein london 1 ) sucks up most of the capital and human energy that would otherwise supply cities south of the severn wash , and 2 ) sucks up much of the capital and human energy that would otherwise supply the country north of the severn wash. . no region of the united states is grossly wealthier or poorer than others to the extent that the severn wash in the uk divides the poor north with the wealthy south . 
  -- the current conservative government is talking about forming a '' [ northern powerhouse ] ( http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/elections2015/election2015/12865823.labour_would_damage_northern_powerhouse_vision__warns_chancellor/ ) '' to help relieve the above imbalance . 
  devolution ca n't be only at the home-nation level , though , because england is so much larger than the other three combined . 
  if england wants scotland to stay in the union , it will have to break itself up for unity 's sake . 
  regional devolution will hopefully give the new states/provinces a chance to compete with greater london on a more equal footing and , as in other federations around the world , come up with innovative , local-specific solutions to their own issues . 
   we can still clinch a cultural victory !, 
  the anglosphere ^ 1 won a cultural victory in 1989 . 
  right now it 's the mopping-up of remaining barbarian villages . 
  ^ 1 , yes , the anglosphere is mostly american in terms of population/economy/culture , but unlike / u/digenisakritas i as an american have no problem with attributing to the uk a substantial share of said victory, 
  / u/safespaceinvader is making a half-serious , half-joking remark about the current refugee influx and what will happen to europe if it continues ( let alone increases ) . 
  in addition to / u/bear4188 's answer , by the mid-18th century english writers speculated that in a century or so the center of the british empire would be in america . 
  that sort of thinking is what walpole was referring to ,, 
  my point was n't so much about the cause of the dysfunctions as the resulting effects on the broader society . 
  non-americans persistently overestimate the share of the us population that blacks form , ^ 1 partly because of hollywood but also because blacks are so , uh , prominent in america-related news . 
  if 13 % of the population can cause such disruptions in the world 's third-largest country with centuries of experience with ethnic pluralism despite sharing the same language , majority religion , and broader culture , what will happen when more dissimilar groups grow to comparable shares in smaller countries without such a history , like germany , denmark , and sweden ? 
  the experience of france ( 7 % muslim , 13.5 % african ) , the uk ( 4 % muslim ) , and the netherlands ( 5.5 % muslim ) are not promising , and they have some more experience with religious/ethnic diversity than other european nations through their empires . 
  ^ 1 ask the next group of europeans you meet to guess the figure . 
  i guarantee most will say between 25 to 40 percent regardless of whether they have been to the us ( and especially if they have , because most will have only visited big cities like new york ) . 
  heck , [ the average american does the same thing ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/4435/public-overestimates-us-black-hispanic-populations.aspx ) !, 
   it 's a giant social experiment , i think , and one which will probably end fairly badly but not violently . 
  you , / u/watrenu , / u/embicek , / u/wonglik , / u/idraga , and others may be interested in [ a recent comment of mine ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3n51xy/germany_took_in_more_than_200000_migrants_last/cvlkcuk?context=3 ) . 
   those are indeed nice examples . 
  alle have american bases on their soil . 
  those bases are there because host governments ( which are , as / u/jamieusa said , completely independent ) want them . 
  if local governments ask us to leave , we leave .
