tonight we had another successful launch from arianespace 's south american spaceport . 
  after being delayed several times because of weather and a faulty part , the soyuz rocket lifted off on time today and delivered all five satellites to the desired orbits . 
  this replay starts at t minus 20 seconds and goes through booster separation ( additingly a rather small part of this lengthy mission ) . 
  i 'll try to edit in a longer video if it is released . 
  if you missed this launch ( and the / r/arianespace [ launch thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/arianespace/comments/4g4h7r/rarianespace_soyuz_flight_vs14_sentinel_1b/ ) that covered it ) , you 're in luck . 
  another arianespace soyuz rocket is slated to launch in less than a month from now on the 24th of may . 
  it will be carrying two galileo satellites for europe 's navigation constellation and should be another great watch . 
  ~ ~ after having been delayed due to weather yesterday , the arianespace soyuz rocket which will carry sentinel 1-b , microscope , and three student cubesats into orbit is ready to give it another shot . 
  weather has improved today , and the ground teams are currently working no problems . ~ ~ ~ ~ if nothing comes up , launch is scheduled for 21:02 utc or 17:02 edt . 
  / r/arianespace is hosting a launch thread for fans to watch and discuss the launch . 
  if you 're a newbie to space launches , feel free to ask questions and i 'm sure someone in the thread will try to answer them for you . 
  good luck arianespace ! ~ ~ [ another delay :( ] ( https://twitter.com/stephenclark1/status/723928920467230720 ) . 
  unfavorable high altitude winds mean the next launch attempt will be tomorrow , april 24 at the same time ( 21:02 utc / 17:02 edt ) [ a link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/arianespace/comments/4g4h7r/rarianespace_soyuz_flight_vs14_sentinel_1b/ ) to the new launch thread . 
  a great overview article from arianespace about their upcoming launch . 
  one week from today , arianespace 's first soyuz rocket of 2016 will take off from the guiana space center in south america . 
  liftoff is scheduled for 9:02 pm utc on the 22nd . 
  you can read all about the launch 's payloads as well as look at the different orbits they will all be launched to . 
  / r/arianespace will be hosting a live launch thread as usual for fans to watch the launch and discuss with fellow fans . 
  i 'll try to have it up about ~ 48 hours prior to launch so look for it wednesday evening , 
  i do n't know a lot about different satellite platforms , but i guess eutelsat decided they wanted this satellite to be built on a ssl 1300 platform . 
  presumably , eutelsat felt that was the best match for the payload that they wanted to launch and since ssl is american based , it was made in the usa . 
  i 'm not sure about comparable classes of satellite buses from other satellite providers , but none of them must have beaten ssl in the categories ( total mass , cost , time to final orbit , for example ) that meant the most to eutelsat . 
  it might be something you 'd rather wake up for depending on your sleep schedule  but it also would n't be the end of the world if you miss one launch . 
  the next ariane 5 ( that we know of ) is scheduled for june 7th , but the next arianespace launch in general is scheduled for the 22nd of april @ ~ 21:00 utc . 
  and if you just want to see any rocket launch , / r/isro has a launch planned for march 10th at 10:30 utc . 
  so there is plenty to see !, 
  ha , yeah the launch is 12:20 am in my time zone , so maybe europe might need it more since it 'll be 5:20 , lol . 
  but definitely goin to have it ready here too . 
  so for anyone who does n't know , arianespace is a european launch provider which operates several classes of rockets out of the spaceport in kourou , french guiana . 
  when this post is twelve hours old ( 05:20 utc on 9 mar ) , one of arianespace 's ariane 5 rockets will launch carrying a satellite for eutelsat into a geosynchronous transfer orbit . 
  the satellite , eutelsat 65 west a , will broadcast direct-to-home video and broadband internet services to customers in latin america and brazil . 
  if you 're interested , / r/arianespace ( which , full disclosure , i 'm a mod of ) is hosting a [ launch thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/arianespace/comments/49gcnx/rarianespace_ariane_flight_va229_eutelsat_65_west/ ) where fans can watch , discuss , and ask questions about tomorrow 's early morning launch . 
  if you 've never seen a launch , i highly recommend coming and watching this one . 
  the launch takes place at 2:20 am local time , and night time rocket launches are always spectacular to see . 
  [ link to original post on / r/arianespace ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/arianespace/comments/5bbloc/ariane_6_industrial_organization/ ) a very neat little infographic showing a breakdown of where the various parts of arianespace 's upcoming rocket will be made . 
  for those of you who do n't know , ariane 6 is arianespace 's / asl 's / esa 's next gen rocket set to launch in 2020 . 
  it is looking to incorporate the best parts of their current ariane 5 while updating/upgrading the rest in order to maintain the high level of performance and reliability , lower cost ( drastically ) , and increase competitiveness . 
  while at first glance , it seems like they are sourcing all of their parts from different countries and locations , a good majority of them are coming from only 3-4 different suppliers . 
  i think this is a good balance in order to use europe 's large space industry base to get the best equipment for the job , while also avoiding becoming too diversified and ending up compromising on the cost competitiveness of the rocket . 
  i 'm really looking forward to ariane 6 's debut . 
  we 've got another rocket launch scheduled for tonight/this morning depending on your timezone . 
  an arianespace vega rocket is set to launch five earth observation satellites into orbit at 01:43 utc 16 sept / 10:43 pm local 15 sept. 
  this will be europe 's seventh launch of the year ( if you include the 2 europeanized soyuz rockets that launched from kourou ) . 
  for those of you who do n't know , the [ vega rocket ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vega_ ( rocket ) is a small orbital launch vehicle largely designed by the italian space agency in cooperation with the european space agency . 
  the italian aerospace company avio is the prime contractor in the vega rocket 's construction . 
  arianespace , a european company , then takes care of the sale and launch of the vehicle . 
  perusat-1 will be peru 's first earth observation satellite , and is equipped with a high resolution ( sub-meter ) camera . 
  the terra bella satellites ( four in total ) are also earth observation satellites for terra bella , a google subsidiary . 
  the link that this post links to is / r/arianespace 's launch thread . 
  a launch thread is basically used for fans to hangout , talk about the launch , ask questions , and watch the launch together via the links in the `` livestreaming '' section . 
  hope to see many of you there !, 
  shows off another successful launch by ariane 5 ( the 73rd success in a row to be exact ) . 
  taking off 7:16 pm local time , it was pretty dark come liftoff , which made for some pretty great contrast with the richly colored exhaust plume . 
  both satellites have been confirmed to be healthy and initial operations to get the satellite the rest of the way to geostationary orbit have already began . 
  while this video only shows a portion of the entire launch broadcast , from t minus 1 minute through till payload fairing separation , you can still see main engine ignition and watch as the ariane 5 remains grounded until the srbs kick-in . 
  next ariane 5 launch wo n't be until early october when sky muster ii and gsat 18 hitch a ride to geostationary transfer orbit . 
  / r/arianespace 's next launch in general is on the 16 of september and will have a vega rocket launching perusat-1 and several skysat satellites for terrabella into a sun-synchronous orbit . 
  if you do n't want to wait that long for a launch , the next global launch attempt should be the / r/spacex falcon 9 rocket launch amos 6 on 3 september . 
  in a little under four hours , arianespace will launch an ariane 5 rocket with the intelsat 33e and 36 satellite into orbit . 
  intelsat 33e is a part of intelsat 's next generation of high-throughput satellites . 
  it will eventually make its way to the 60 degrees east orbital slot in geostationary orbit where it will serve the european , african , the middle eastern and asian markets . 
  intelsat 36 is a more traditional wide-beam satellite which is bound for the 68.5 east geostationary slot . 
  i will provide television broadcast and other communications services over africa and south asia . 
  total launch mass for today 's launch is 10,735 kg !, 
  as always , please check-out the live / r/arianespace launch thread . 
  we 'll be discussing the launch and watching live as the ariane 5 lifts off into the skies over kourou and the guiana space center . 
  hope to see you there . 
  edit - launch has been put on hold due to an undisclosed reason . 
  today 's launch window extends to 22:40 utc / 6:40 pm edt . 
  standby . 
  edit 2 - launch has been rescheduled for 22:16 utc / 6:16 pm edt, 
  after several delays due to an anomaly with an umbilical connector between the upper stage and launch table ( which has since been resolved ) and bad weather , arianespace will once again attempt a liftoff of an ariane 5 rocket with the echostar xviii and brisat satellites in tow . 
  some quick facts about today 's mission : ** payload ** | ** payload mass ** | ** targeted orbit ** | ** mission ** -- | -- | -- | -- echostar xviii | 6,300 kg | 250km x 35,766 km x 6 \u00b0 | direct broadcast satellite brisat | 3,540 kg | 250km x 35,766 km x 6 \u00b0 | telecommunications furthermore , the ariane 5 launch vehicle is one of the most reliable rockets in the world , not having experienced a launch failure in its 70 + most recent launches and over thirteen years . 
  this is arianespace 's fifth launch of the year , and their third ariane 5 of the year . 
  the thread over at / r/arianespace is for fans to watch the launch , ask questions , and generally hangout with fellow arianespace/rocket fans . 
  hope to see you there edit - liftoff has been delayed for 15 minutes , but they are still planning on launching today . 
  standby  edit 2 - further launch delay . 
  ~ 45 minutes remain in today 's launch window to try a launch again . 
  edit 3 - a final attempt to launch is in process with a launch at 5:38 edt / 21:38 utc . 
  edit 4 - just as they were nearing the end of the day 's launch window , arianespace managed to successfully liftoff and deliver their payloads to orbit . 
  another successful mission for the arianespace team . 
  do n't forget beidou ( chinese ) , and the regional irnss ( indian ) and qzss ( japanese ) . 
   and it 's not that they ca n't agree on a single standard . 
  it 's about securing navigation services , even during times of war . 
  if only gps existed , for instance , and the us and russia got involved in a war against each other , russia does n't want to be left high and dry if the us denies them access to the gps satellites . 
  so they 've developed/launched/operated the glonass constellation . 
  so normally i try to post these little pre-launch reminders four hours prior to launch , but looking at the time of the launch ( 4:48 am edt/my timezone ) i 'll hopefully be sleeping soundly four hours before launch . 
  but on to the rocket launch ... 
  when this post is twelve hours old , 08:48 utc , 24th of may , arianespace will be launching a europeanized soyuz rocket carrying two galileo satellites into orbit . 
  the galileo satellites will be part of the european space agency 's navigation constellation , which aims to provide europe with a global positioning system independent of the u.s. 's gps network . 
  twelve of the constellation 's satellites are already in orbit and providing positioning data , and there are plans to increase this number to thirty . 
  initial services of the galileo constellation will be opened to the public by the end of the year . 
  sure it will , it just wo n't be in one piece afterwards :p but although vega is n't doing first stage recovery right now , does n't mean it wo n't be a great show or helping europe expand its prominence in space . 
  after all , watching a ~ 135,000 kg stack of explosives precisely launch a satellite hundreds of kilometers into space where it will help countless people through its observations is pretty cool by its own rights . 
  in four hours , a vega rocket is set to launch the sentinel-2b satellite for esa 's copernicus program . 
  once in orbit , the satellite will monitor land use , provide disaster relief , and provide climate change monitoring . 
  this will be the first vega launch of the year , and the third european launch of 2017 . 
  designed by the italian space agency in cooperation with the european space agency , and built by prime contractor avio , vega is always a treat to watch . 
  you can read all about the launch in the launch thread that this post links to . 
  feel free to ask questions and discuss the launch , and be sure to tune in to the listed livestreams to watch the launch with other fans .
