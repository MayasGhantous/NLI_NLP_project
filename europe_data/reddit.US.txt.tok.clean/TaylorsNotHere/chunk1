  german is so cool,

   china will break up into separate states so into ... tibet and outer mongolia ... who combined make up less than 2 % of china 's population ? 
  ( but let 's be real , the prc will * never * let that happen ) china is more than 90 % han chinese , and even non-hans see no reason to separate from china . 
  manchuria , guangdong , and even uyghurstan to an extent are * wayyy * too assimilated into china , and they 'd rather be united in a larger country and have a spot on the world stage than be on their own . 
  manchuria , guangdong , szechuan , etc. 
  are as likely to secede from china as wales is from england or florida from america . 
  most people on the islands are maltese or european and are usually catholic/secular , not arab or african like in sweden . 
  have you * seen * reddit 's hate-boner for israel ? 
  wait never mind do n't see it that 's a bad idea, 
  i 'd say kurds are just as much hated by arabs as by turks .

   the most civilised country in the whole area iran . 
  the country where gays are given the option of forced castration or death . 
  the country that has a `` supreme leader '' . 
  the country where if a woman is raped and speaks up about it , she 'll be silenced with arrest , kidnapping , or more rape . 
  the country where religious minorities like jews and zoroastrians ca n't be open about their faith without being lynched .

  ... and this is why wwi happened, 
  wtf is going on in tuva ? 
  or japanese , or italians ... 
  why is there soft-serve on the french fries, 
  copenhagen 's never had a metro before ? 
  * no longer *, 
  thanks for explaining , 
  gosh , why does germany hate japan so much when germany 's biggest fan is japan ? 
  d : and why does japan hate israel so much ? 
  that was a big shock : o, 
  well at least the uk is no longer treating women like second class citizens , systematically executing gays , and seeing the irreligious as less than garbage . 
  do they have oil ? 
  sounds like somebody needs liberation !, 
  because now it 's set in stone . 
  any pro-marriage legislation will be immediately struck down because now it 's unconstitutional . 
  that 's a whole lot easier said than done . 
  unregistered cohabition, 
  but were n't these states officially atheist for 4 + decades ? 
  wow , that sounds incredibly stupid . 
  thanks for the answer !, 
  what are they ? 
  to me politics seems like a pendulum . 
  i mean look at us . 
  for the past 30 years , we ca n't even make our mind up what party we like . 
  8 years of a republican president , 8 years of a democrat , then back to 8 years of republican , and then another democratic 8 years . 
  and then look at our congress for the past 30 years : 98-100 : d house/r senate 101-103 : d house/d senate 104-109 : r house/r senate 110-111 : d house/d senate 112-113 : r house/d senate ( democrats won more votes for the house in 2012 , but lost because of gerrymandering ) ( likely ) 114th : r house/r senate ( making a full cycle ) so the real question is * how much * and * how often * does the pendulum sway . 
  hitler 's social policies were extremely right wing , but his fiscal policies were far to the left . 
  yay !, 
  this is great news to hear :d, 
  i hope you realize that all of that already happened by the time the huge waves of immigrants started pouring into the us . 
  somebody does n't know us history ... 
  which seems nearly impossible to get, 
  have fun getting steamrolled . 
  again . 
  are n't guns illegal in germany ? 
  from knowing friends who have emigrated to the eu , it seems like the exact opposite . 
  europe seems like a reverse-alcatraz , it 's almost impossible to get * in * . 
  gates of mordor yo, 
   multiculturalism is a naive and dangerous concept !, 
  it 's also a lie and a social bomb waiting to go off . 
  yeah , remember when the us imploded during the late 19th/early 20th century because of massive immigration and never grew to be the world superpower it is today ? 
  ... wait a minute ... 
   france is strong , we can survive on our own . 
  fun fact : france 's longest continual border is with brasil, 
   he was n't acting like some deranged anti-immigrant right-wing nutjob . 
  what he said definitely sounded like something a deranged anti-immigrant right-wing nutjob would say , so ...  multiculturalism is n't really a thing , and it definitely is n't a thing in europe wow , that seriously sounds completely miserable . 
   immigrants * are * expected to adapt to the country they go to live in and this shitty culture-killing attitude is the root of this issue . 
  why should immigrants be expected to leave * everything * behind ? 
  their language , their culture , their religion ? 
  immigrants are n't cattle , they certainly should n't be `` branded '' as they move into a new corral . 
  if in order to be a racist all you had to say was `` i hate ____ people '' , there 'd be a lot less `` racists '' . 
  did you read his post ? 
  it was prejudicial as fuck . 
  not all spaniards are a cartoonish stereotype . 
  and fucking racist genuine observations at that . 
  hispanophobia is a bitch , ai n't it ? 
  oh my heavens , multiculturalism is a thing !, 
  i have to ^ * gasp * learn a * few simple words * in * their * language !, 
  why ca n't * everyone * learn * my * superior language and assimilate to * my * supreme culture !!! 1 !, 
  jumping jehoshaphat , a few shitty sandwich chains are n't selling butchered-mammal anymore !, 
  someone alert the queen !, 
  unless ^ * gasp * the * swiss * invade !, 
  europe will fight to its last american, 
  well not to mention they speak a different language . 
  the uk has never taken responsibility for or action against the atrocious homophobia they 've spread across the globe ...
