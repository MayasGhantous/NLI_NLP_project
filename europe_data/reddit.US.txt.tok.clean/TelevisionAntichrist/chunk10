   `` i understand , sir . 
  we have to coordinate . '', 
   `` good , good . 
  i know . 
  please notify your boss . '', 
   `` we will notify our boss , '' the guard says . 
  but he does n't move , instead taking a large handkerchief from his pocket and wiping his forehead . 
  he seems uncomfortable . 
  he apparently either does n't know which boss to consult or does n't have the nerve to make the call . 
   the consul pleads with the guard : `` please help us . 
  there is drinking water equipment there . 
  the people need water . '', 
   `` no problem . '', 
   but nothing happens . 
  one team is in the airport and ca n't get out , while the other team is at the gate and ca n't get in . 
   a car stops at the gate with people from the local water authority inside : a driver , the boss and two engineers . 
  they are supposed to help the german team , but they too are reluctant to challenge the guard , so they remain in the car . 
  a coconut falls to the ground . 
  `` very dangerous , '' says the boss , looking at the coconut . 
   the consul finally convinces the guard to let them in . 
  he has discovered that they have a mutual acquaintance , and suddenly the guard agrees to drive them toward the tarmac in a military bus . 
  relationships are critical in the philippines . 
  you talk about ` power ' , and ` us doctrine ' , but you have no idea what the fuck you 're talking about , thinking you win an argument by just saying `` iraq '' . 
  it 's aegerlich . 
  you even have no idea , not only of what the concept of global public goods actually is , but how you yourself are a recipient of many global public goods supplied by the united states and the united states military . 
   why the fuck should a permanent seat be tied to military prowess ? 
  that 's * exactly * what i mean . 
  europeans - germans - argue with their hearts , instead of their heads . 
  it 's exasperating . 
  this is a really important article . 
  as i 've studied this topic for a long time now , finally , the shortcomings of the european approach to security and defense are being laid bare . 
  in the book ` the united states of europe ' by t.r. 
  reid , the author talks about the freeriding of europe on the us for its security . 
  he remarks specifically that when the us complains about europe spending all its money on welfare vs. warfare , that `` europe has no good answer - because its true '' . 
  however , in the past five years living in europe , europeans have attempted time and time and time again - to me - to give convoluted answers to this complaint . 
  `` we are n't threatened . . '' so on and so forth . 
  with the recent crises , we are finally seeing - officially and without qualification/caveat , that europe has * no good answer * . 
  ok . now with that ` settled ' , ( i.e. 
  the ` free-riding ' hypothesis ) can europe please start paying some money for its own security and defense ? 
  this is utterly embarrassing . 
  when i say `` tanks '' , i 'm more referring to military power in general . 
  you try talking to a european about ` hard power ' - and the conversation does n't last for very long . 
  yeah , its definitely * not * just that , its more that people here are simply too reserved for my taste . 
  that does not apply to the uk . 
  i 'm just saying . . 
  however , if europe did n't free ride on the us ( and nato ) to provide its security , while it spends all of its money on lord knows what , i would have no problem whatsoever with anything anybody in europe says about russia . 
  as it stands however , you europeans have been talking shit about the us for the last ten years , and now you expect the us to be the rock upon which you stand , while talking shit about russia . 
  it stinks to high heaven , and i ca n't stand it - i 'm going home in a month or so , leaving europe behind me forever . 
  well , you did erase your comment , but apart from that , i really hope never to come across your on / r/europe again . 
   usa world wide terrotists hunters , killing osamas and taking their oil providing freedom like fucking super heroes . 
  just ignore that cia created and funded al caeda . 
  *  whataboutism, 
   and are probably beyond salvation . 
  . . guys ? 
  this may sound like a stupid question , but ... - what if god was one of us ? 
  you 're an idiot . 
  go sit in the corner . 
  well maybe you european idiots should have bought some tanks instead of throwing all that money at lord knows what and talking shit about the us every time it comes up and about how militaristic us culture is . 
   because allowing third parties to influence bilateral agreement of the eu recognize , however , that that ` third party ' is actually the nation which took over half of europe for the second half of the 20th century , and would have taken most of it over were it not for the efforts of the usa . 
  so , maybe have some respect ? 
  we 're not talking about zambia here . 
  actually , with your comment currently at minus 25 , i do n't see * so much * wrong with the logic of your argument . 
  ( i think it has to do with perspective ) see , europeans today like to think that europe exists in a post-westphalian space , a post-war and post-great power politics arena . 
  they like to think they 're eu stronk , because that means that they do n't really need the us . 
  they deny the existence of realism and like to think they live in a liberal world . 
  then , 25 years after soviet russia falls ( which most europeans who write on this sub were n't even born yet ) , russia actually starts to get some of its game back . 
  russia is more dynamic than had been the case , and is a bit miffed that europe totally disregards it . 
  but it seems that europeans have been living in an artificial situation for the last two some odd decades or so - it was un-normal , because soviet russia had been * forced * to its knees by the us . 
  the results of that have lasted for a very long time , but in russia today ( * wink ) , these effects are wearing off . 
  so , we are more seeing what a more ` normal ' situation in europe actually is . 
  you basically just * described * that , and on / r/europe , people get angry . 
  they say that putin is * irrational * . 
  he is not . 
  the world should be happy there is no irrational man in russia who could push the button . 
  he is , rather , a first-class strategist . 
  this article quite follows your logic . 
  it 's one of the best articles written on the ukraine situation [ john mearsheimer ( 20 aug , 2014 ) , ` why the ukraine crisis is the west 's fault : the liberal delusions that provoked putin ' ] ( http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141769/john-j-mearsheimer/why-the-ukraine-crisis-is-the-wests-fault ), 
  the wiki talks about ` block 12 ' as being [ particularly contentious . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aphrodite_gas_field ) ( according to turkey ) ( turkey , which does not recognize the border agreements of cyprus with its neighbors , [ 11 ] threatened to mobilize its naval forces should cyprus proceed with plans to begin drilling at block 12 . ), 
  i know that the roc is employing an american company , ( possibly shell ( ? ) ), 
  the thinking of which i assume incorporates the assumption that turkey would never actually ` attack ' an american oil drilling company . 
  i was kidding . 
  i 'll bet its something you think is clever , is n't it ? 
  all your posts on this sub / u/tachyonburst are pretty weak . 
  go back to posting about your 9/11 conspiracy theories , maybe you 'd finally get some interest . 
  whatever bro , it 's in the past . 
  that 's the rub - figuring out exactly where the roc 's eez begins/ends . 
  that 's where much of the motivation comes from for turkey to give the full support that it does to northern cyprus . 
  turkey stronk !, 
  yeah , but on the flip side , you can go to tallinn whenever you really want and hang out with some of the friendliest , hottest women in the world . 
  so do n't be down little fella !, 
  the estimated natural gas reserves in the levant basin , though , are not cute . 
  it could push the issue to the conflict in cyprus to the front and center , which would be interesting . 
  ( and this conflict is also why the eu/csdp and nato ca n't officially even * talk * to one another ), 
  i just have a soft spot in my heart for pizza hut , what can i say ? 
  you said  but what can you expect from a *** us ambassador *** really ? 
  then you said  notice i said `` diplomats who deal with foreign affairs '' , not specifically `` ambassadors '' . 
  i hate you, 
  thanks for the epilepsy warning !, 
  i hate those flashy things .
