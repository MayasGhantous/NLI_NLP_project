  because i like it , and i want to . 
  ** edit : ** i have n't had any real american food for years , stop acting like some euro snob . 
  i counted zero titties on / r/yurop 's banner . 
  / r/murica - remains undefeated . 
  sorry champ . 
  keep at it though !, 
  we believe in you guys !, 
  maybe i should mail them instead . 
  i mean i 'd * like * to bring 20 or 30 with me in my check in suitcase . 
  giving one of those to someone as a little present would be pandemonium . 
   a decent quality of life . 
  i think you 're getting the people living in the usa and people living in raqqa , syria mixed up there buddy . 
  can you please get laid already so we do n't have to hear these hormonal teenage rants ? 
  maybe he likes to [ treat himself ] ( http://www.sheckys.com/files/2013/10/2013-03-13-treatyoself.gif ), 
  go to the nearest city of 30,000 people or more , and go to the biggest liquor store there . 
  is there anything else i can help you with ? 
  every grocery store in germany besides aldi carries heinz brand ketchup . 
  shhhhhhh, 
   i do n't understand it either . 
  you have been banned from / r/murica . 
  do you mean cavity , as in tooth cavities , or cavity as in a space within an object ? 
  so . . the selection of food in the us is `` atrocious '' if one ca n't easily find the most obscure ( and expensive ) ` niche ' european food product ? 
  ( i might add - finding ` flor de esgueva ' cheese in germany would probably be a wild goose chase . 
  i 'll try to find some while i 'm still over here , i 'm curious . ), 
  i 'd say the ` gyro ' is pretty similar , though greek instead of turkish . 
  those are all over the place . 
  ( i.e. 
  big college towns/cities ) the ` doener ' kiosks in nyc are probably pretty close to how it is in germany . 
  saying something is ` not even remotely the same ' is comparing a german doener mit alles zum mitnehmen . . to a chair . 
  i 've been in germany five years , had my fair share , but what i 'm really looking forward to when i get back soon - american pizza . 
  heavenly . 
  pizza in germany * ai n't * the same , even the pizza huts here use a different recipe/ingredients . 
  oh , for the love of deep dish . 
  ** edit : ** 5 years in germany and about 50 doeners later from all over the place , the only real difference i can imagine between the nyc kebab scene ( or even little greek gyro places you find all over the place ) is the sauce . 
  everything else - including enormous hunk of meat on stick in corner - is pretty straightforward . 
  i never thought they were that special anyway , but handy on some of those nights out for certain . 
  it 's also * very * nice to not have to go to fast food w / doener kiosks all over in europe/germany , they 're usually open until 3am on weekends , and they 're many times situated in quite convenient locations . 
  ( i.e. 
  on the walk home ) saved me a few times that they 're open until late on sunday , too , while everything else in germany is closed . 
  i do have to admit - french fries with mayo * is * actually better than ketchup . 
  i may have to bring a bunch home from germany with me . . 
  the 5,000 euros , is what normal non-eu citizens have to have in a ` blocked ' bank account , * before * they set foot on the airplane that will take them to germany . 
  i think that ` blocked ' account , can be an account from their country . 
  you would have to show a paper from your bank , citing your balance and that it is a ` blocked ' account ( i.e. 
  your bank will only allow you to take out eur 700/month or so ) - to the insurance company , ( to get student insurance ) the german ` auslanderbehoerde ' , ( to get your student visa ) and possibly to the university - also , if you want a german bank account ( essential ) , you would have to show this piece of paper to the german bank . 
  because you are a us/canadian citizen , germany ( and probably most of eu uni 's ) will waive this requirement , and allow your parents to sign an official piece of paper , promising they will give you financial assistance throughout your studies . 
  * this * is a very nice thing - certainly , this option is not open from people from africa or the me or probably asia . 
  it has to do with country - agreements . 
  the us has a lot of good agreements with germany . 
  however , once you get your student visa . 
  then you have the right to work in germany - i think the limit is 25 hours/week . 
  so , it 's good if you can convince your parents to hook you up w / a promise to the german government . 
  you could save a bunch of money , show them you 're serious , then start working once you 're in germany alongside your studies . 
  if your parents are n't willing to send you at least $ 200/month for around the first year or so , it may make things difficult . 
  however , if you can save money , maybe you can make it work . 
  deadlines begin around december , and usually go until the end of february . 
  ( sometimes end of march ), 
  apply for a scholarship through daad . 
  take a look at mannheim and heidelberg . 
  these days , full time masters students ( at least us citizens ) are allowed to work quite a bit more hours per week than was the case before 2013 . 
  however , along with studies , you may be looking at a 400 euro/month job . 
  ( common job level for students , because no taxes have to be paid and is easy for employers re : paperwork to employ a non-eu citizen at that rate ) however , if you do n't have support from your parents , things will be very difficult . 
  you may be able to find work at bars , etc. 
  most foreign students in germany , have to have a bank account with eur 5,000 in it - right off the bat . 
  then , when they get a german bank account , that bank account will only allow the person to take out eur 700 or so a month . 
  a ` blocked account ' , i think its called . 
  american citizens , anyway , have the option of having their parents sign an official form , available in person only from german consulates around the u.s. ( such as in chicago ) , or obviously the german embassy . 
  the parents sign this form as a ` promise ' to the german government to back up their child with money if he/she is in any financial trouble . 
  do n't worry about anything ` after graduation ' . 
  cross that bridge if/when you get there . 
   troll you are . 
  nah , was just bored . 
  playing some online cod4 atm though , so problem solved , 
  wow , news just came out that the us and partner nations have deployed fighters to syria and have made bomb strikes within syria . 
  maybe escape from tomorrow . . 
  you know any good horror movies released in 2014 ? 
  i 'm trying to find something to watch . 
  seen ` stoker ' ? 
  i may need a little ice for that burn !, 
  are you done ? 
  no idea what you 're talking about . 
  see previous post . 
  it has more to do with precision , and accuracy of statements , and not making broad sweeping general statements . 
  and you write :  i think i stayed pretty polite and actually did my best to explain myself well , if you think that there is no problem in the following statements of yours with either a. politeness or b. accuracy , than as i said - i 'm not going to reply to you again . 
   what the hell ? 
  this line makes no sense at all . 
   downvoting wont make the problem dissapear , but whatever really , keep ignoring it and think your country is the only one who knows how to properly run the economy . 
  your american dream is more and more just that , a distant dream . 
   just cause you dont suffer from it doesnt mean your country isn \u00b4 t one of the worst in the world with regards to income inequality and steadily becoming worse in that respect . 
   you still have the advantage of having the world reserve currency , but that probably won \u00b4 t last that much longer . 
  and once you start having to pay for your oil in remnibi or whatever currency  instead of dealing with what actually caused this crisis , a completely lack of any regulation or oversight of the financial sector . 
   but i think you \u00b4 re seriously delusional if you underestimate it like you do and act like nothing really happened * btw * , it 's spelled ** ` renminbi ' **, 
  oh man - britain now under two boots !, 
  i heard lenin was actually just chilling in a cabin in siberia for awhile , ice fishing and what not . . 
  yeah , i just told him that he used such over the top language that i ca n't even engage with him . 
   you know fully well what i meant why do n't you write what you mean ? 
  anyway , talking about the problems of the us is n't what this article in question is about . 
   saying europe should just print more to deal with low inflation . 
  i did n't say that . 
  whether i agree or disagree with that point .
