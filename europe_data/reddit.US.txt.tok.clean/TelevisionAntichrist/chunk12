  but anyway , i ca n't argue with you , because you made broad sweeping generalized statements , that are at least true in part in a general sense , but you use such over the top language that i ca n't even engage with you . 
  take / u/hoagh seriously at your own peril ;-), 
   your american dream is more and more just that , a distant dream . 
   doesnt mean your country isn \u00b4 t one of the worst in the world with regards to income inequality and steadily becoming worse in that respect . 
  the us does have some problems , i 'm not saying it does n't . 
  however , the us is not even close to `` one of the worst in the world '' . 
  actually , the us [ falls right in the middle of the range of western europe , in terms of income inequality in developed economies . 
  ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/19/global-inequality-how-the-u-s-compares/ ) so , the above article includes this paragraph :  before accounting for taxes and transfers , the u.s. ranked 10th in income inequality ; among the countries with more unequal income distributions were france , the u.k. and ireland . 
  but after taking taxes and transfers into account , the u.s. had the second-highest level of inequality , behind only chile . 
  ( mexico and brazil had higher after-tax/transfer gini scores , but no `` before '' scores with which to compare them ; including them would push the u.s. down to fourth place . ), 
  so , the article measured inequality expressed by gini coefficients . 
  after taxes and transfers , the us scored .380 . 
  germany .286 , israel .379 , britain .341 , france .303 , australia .334 , canada .311 , netherlands .288 . 
  chile scored a .501 . 
  there 's a bigger difference , between scoring .380 , as the us did , and scoring .501 . 
  you * talk * as though , the us is scoring a .501 on the gini coefficient . 
  if the us * were * , - then , we would have to start listening to people like you . 
  but we 're not . 
  you may as well be talking about australia , or talking about britain , with the way you argue here . 
  and anyway , i do n't know if you were using hyperbole or not , but i 'm pretty sure countries like zimbabwe are the ones who are actually :  one of the worst in the world with regards to income inequality and steadily becoming worse in that respect . 
  the rest of your stuff is kind of over the top , though , such as  being bankrupted if you happen to need medical care . 
  ( are you saying that if i need stitches in the us - that 's `` medical care '' - suddenly i 'm bankrupted ? 
  i ca n't imagine the suffering of americans who have to take their kids to the dentist !, 
  they probably have to sell the house ! ), 
  i just want to have real conversations on here , backed up by others who have researched the subject , instead of just throwing general accusations about our countries problems around . 
  i know income inequality exists , but you made it sound worse than it actually is . 
   even though the middle-class is getting squeezed and more and more people rely on foodstamps to get by , or have to work 3 jobs to be even able to pay their rent and live a somewhat normal live . 
  sources which back up what you infer here ? 
   just cause you managed to inflate other asset bubbles after the subprime mess by means of your boundless quantative easing , at the same time indebting future generations and causing the wealth inequality to rise to levels never seen before in history , doesn \u00b4 t mean you \u00b4 re a success from a standpoint of wealth being even close to evenly distributed . 
  sources which back up what you infer here ? 
  ok , i did n't mean to label you or something , no worries !, 
  consider it part of your studies ;-), 
   some dodgy right wing american site i thought that human rights watch was considered left wing . 
  i also consider it quite respected , is n't it ? 
  [ hrw website ] ( http://www.hrw.org/ ) [ hrw wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_watch ), 
  ` mon nah i certainly would not refer to myself as a ` bull ' lol there 's definitely some problems , do n't get me wrong . 
   but printing ai n't cheap for a college student in bosnia yeah ? 
  in germany its always 5 cents/page . 
  in any event , these articles are not easy to read - even for me , so * especially * if english is n't your mother language . 
  and the thing is , that reading such articles , you come across many terms , and concepts , which you have to look up individually in order to know what the author is talking about . 
  that 's why i said that about printing them out . 
  actually , i had to re-read them a few times , and all in all it took me about a month to absorb all of the information in them . 
  however , i pretty much agree with you , in a general sense , about the middle east . 
  the french were really the ones pushing for ousting khaddafi , when the french and the us were talking about it , susan rice said to the french `` we do n't want your shitty war ! '', 
  the us ended up ` leading from behind ' , but the uk and the french were definitely pushing for libya more than the us . 
  my favorite realist , john mearsheimer , is usually quite against any interventions in the me ( though i have n't yet heard what he thinks about is ) . 
  he is * very * interesting , and i highly recommend him . 
  here 's a link to one of his talks : [ john mearsheimer , 2013 , us army war college strategy conference keynote speaker ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3m3rxzjsfu ) here 's also a link to a debate he recently had on - of all places - russia today https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9674prbm6g, 
  it seems as though you are missing a lot of important information , regarding the us national debt . 
  for example , as a percentage of gdp , the us 's debt is roughly comparable to belgium 's national debt . 
  yeah , there 's sometimes a few people on this subreddit - who have n't exactly read a book on economics . 
  first off , the american economic situation is very deep and liquid , the us is in many - * many * ways , the absolute * last * economy the world needs to worry about . 
  second , we have already `` seen '' twice - first , in how the us did not let its economy collapse in 2008 , but handled it . 
  if the us had n't done what it did , and - for example - stuck by the principles of ` free markets ' instead of imposing keynesian policies ( i.e. 
  by ` bailing out ' companies ) , the world would have plunged into economic depression . 
  few have any real insight into the absolutely horrific global economic outcomes , if the us had n't acted the way it did . 
  and yes - this included the fed printing money . 
  we also saw a big stink in europe , over the debt-ceiling argument in the us , and many were speculating the us would default on its debt payments . 
  that would have been very , very bad , because investors would have really started to think twice about buying us gov ' t debt , which would lead to even more problems . 
  that did n't happen . 
  i knew it would n't , i knew the democrats and republicans would come together at the 11th hour and that it was all just political theater . 
  but the theater is n't what was important , what was important is that the us took care of the situation . 
  actually , examples abound . 
  so yeah , we 'll see , but we already have seen almost all we need to see , i would say . 
  i 'm from the us , have lived in europe for the last five years , and i do n't understand why it 's starting to be an argument on / r/europe that americans do n't belong here , especially regarding threads on topics such as the ukraine situation or the european economic situation , when both the us and europe are highly inter-related , intertwined , and interdependent . 
  i would say that is why american opinions are relevant . 
  and for the record , i agree with everything / u/theapplemansam wrote . 
  for example , i was offended , when the german government responded to the official us government paper on the negative aspects of the german trade surplus as being `` incomprehensible '' . 
  ** edit : ** [ bloomberg , sep 14 , 2013 , ` germany 's trade surplus and exports reach all-time highs ' ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702304073204579169454159735052 ) [ der spiegel article , oct 31 , 2013 , relaying german reaction `` incomprehensible '' ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germany-defends-trade-surplus-after-critical-us-treasury-report-a-931126.html ) [ germany hits back at us over trade criticism , * wsj * , oct 31 , 2013 ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424052702304073204579169454159735052 ) [ paul krugman reaction , nov 3 , 2013 , ` those depressing germans ' ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/04/opinion/krugman-those-depressing-germans.html?_r=0 ) ** edit 2 : ** the last paragraph in krugman 's article :  and the thing is , it 's not just the germans . 
  germany 's trade surplus is damaging for the same reason cutting food stamps and unemployment benefits in america destroys jobs -- and republican politicians are about as receptive as german officials to anyone who tries to point out their error . 
  in the sixth year of a global economic crisis whose essence is that there is n't enough spending , ** many policy makers still do n't get it . 
  and it looks as if they never will . 
  i think that intervening `` to bring democracy '' , in recent times , only pertains to the 2003 iraq invasion . 
  there were other justifications , such as ` wmd 's ' , which turned out not to be there , but in any event , i was very much - very much - against iraq . 
  so i think that your question , refers more directly to iraq , no ? 
  if so , i am against . 
  i am more of a realist than a liberal , and the realist position is spelled out in the article i sent your way , about the proper role of the us in the world . 
  this is , essentially , a position of ` offshore balancing ' , or ` restraint ' , as opposed to ` deep engagement ' . 
  i was also against going into syria - precisely , because we would most likely not be able to ` fix ' anything . 
  so , i think we would both agree with one another on syria . 
  i do , however , believe that the us - along with its nato allies , such as france and germany - should be doing what they are doing regarding isis . 
  that paper i sent you , from 1997 , has an ` answer ' or ` response ' paper from 2012 . 
  it 's called ` do n't come home , america ' . 
  here 's the link . 
  [ brooks et . 
  ( 2012 ) do n't come home , america . 
  * international security * ] ( http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/22595/dont_come_home_america.html ) these two papers give a good balance , of precisely all of the information we need , when we are making our own opinions on american foreign policy . 
  these papers , are about ` american grand strategy ' , and contain all of the basic information one needs - along with if you want to follow up on some footnotes and sources given in these articles - to begin to make sense of american foreign policy . 
  from there , one can really start to form an informed opinion on american foreign policy . 
  before i started reading articles like these , i was lost . 
  now , i know much more - and i 'm starting to realize * actually * how much i do n't know !, 
  but that 's a good thing - that 's when you know you 're really starting to get somewhere !, 
  take your time , in any event , but i would actually recommend that you print these articles out , having the hard copy , making notes in the margins , underlining/highlighting interesting passages , circling key phrases or key sources . . 
  many academic/most academic articles such as this are behind paywalls , usually around $ 35 for a download , or usually available for college students who attend a university that has access to all these journals . 
  that 's a bit unfortunate for ` everyone ' , because the * best * information is from such academic journals , and many people simply do n't have access to it . 
  a bit of a shame , but i do n't expect jk rowling to sell harry potter books for one penny , either . 
  in any event , i like to recommend these exact articles to people , because they helped me out so much with my own confusion on the topic . 
   these are mostly my personal opinions , but when it comes to non-interventionism you 're not talking about ` non-interventionism ' , your position is more likened to [ neo-isolationism . 
  ] ( http://buchanan.org/blog/neo-isolationism-soaring-6093 ) with that said , you also seem to be advocating the most extreme form of neo-isolationism , which is allowing genocides to occur based on a philosophical belief that if such things as genocides occur in a country , ( such as in rwanda , or for that matter , the khmer rouge ) it is ultimately for the good of the country itself . 
  the reason i 'm asking for printed sources , is because for something to actually be written - whether officially published or self-published - the author has to have really taken a lot of time to think through their position , and all the implications contained therein .
