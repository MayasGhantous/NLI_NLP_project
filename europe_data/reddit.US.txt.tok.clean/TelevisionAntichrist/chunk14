  first , i do n't know why you have to disparage and insult me . 
  i did n't necessarily say that * i * thought that the euro was , at present , in danger of crumbling . 
  i said that people all around the world were wondering if that was going to happen . 
  ( during the european economic crisis ) my point was that , only 15 years after its introduction , for so many people around the world to be questioning it does not bode well for the ~ ~ someday the euro will be as strong as the dollar or stronger ~ ~ ` the euro will take its place as a reserve currency ' argument . 
  just last week , the german party ` alternative for germany ' got a surprising number of votes . 
  that party is an anti-euro party . 
  in germany . 
  and it takes a lot to get germans to go against the grain . 
  you may have the schengen agreement , but ( and i ca n't find the source at the moment ) only around 1-2 % of europeans currently live in a country other than the one they are from . 
  there are other areas of the theory of the [ ` optimal currency area ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optimum_currency_area ) that europe does not quite reach in some respects , and does in other respects . 
  when you say ` we ' , i claim here that you are using that word incorrectly . 
  sometimes , it seems to me that some eu supporting europeans start to talk about the european union as though it is one single country . 
  but each country in the eu is a sovereign nation and has its own national interests . 
  the eu is condemned to have problems getting 28 member states ( maybe more in the future ) to agree on things - especially the most important things . 
  it is somehow misleading to talk about the eu as a single actor . 
  however , the sheer size of the eu market * does * give the eu a lot of power in trade negotiations . 
  for example , in the negotiations on the proposed ttip . 
  where it comes to ` power ' in a more general sense , though , [ the eu is more akin to a small power , i.e. 
  that of argentina or sweden . 
  ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5965.2010.02128.x/abstract ) when you write  the eu now accounts for more of the worlds gdp you make it sound as though that gdp belongs to the eu . 
  it does n't . 
  it belongs to the individual countries that are members of the eu . 
  the us 's gdp - belongs to the us . 
  there 's a big difference there , where it comes to , for example , investor confidence . 
  in many ways , the european union 's existence in and of itself is controversial , as it must - by its own virtue - step on the toes of a nation 's sovereignty . 
  such a problem does n't exist for a single country . 
  there are many things i 'm forgetting or ignoring here . 
  also when you write  with more and more globalization it is likely that the eu and the us will be near equal in a few decade and they will both be used as reserve currencies . 
  do you have any sources for this ? 
  i 've never heard that argument being made before . 
  ** edit : ** i reckon i have to work on getting my point across without sounding like an asshole . 
  and here for at least the last few years , ( if not the last few decades ) i thought the common european wisdom was that those troops were worthless and the us has troops in germany only to serve american interests ? 
  i believe was the cry ? 
  all the hullabaloo about the us putting rockets in eastern europe ? 
  you guys just seem to be kind of fair weather fans of the us and nato , and i do n't expect any upvotes for that statement . 
  ( not talking to you personally / u/jimmy17 ), 
  europe almost committed suicide , and then gave the united states 55 years to consolidate the position of the dollar within the global economy . 
  now , after only 15 years and recent global speculation that the euro project itself will crumble , europeans think that they can make arguments that the united states is somehow fragile and will soon be prone to usurpation . 
  what a lot of europeans do n't seem to realize ( or do n't * want * to ) , is that they have n't done enough research , and they do n't know what they 're talking about . 
  time after time , i see arguments based on the most thin of sources . 
  i have people in europe telling me that they think that russia is the most powerful country in the world - even though the united states spends a little less than half of the equivalent of russia 's nominal gdp on defense every year , for example . 
  europeans - time and time again - underestimate in so many ways the abilities of the united states , and it seems to me that such opinions are based on nothing except that bush was an idiot and invaded iraq . 
  we have so many advantages ( for example , size of population , one language throughout all 50 states , relative ease of moving from one part of the us for a job to another ) its not even worth mentioning . 
  that the 2008 financial crisis has turned into what it is today in the us ( unemployment below 7 % ) is a clear example of this . 
  if this sub had more posts sceptical of the us based on solid foundational evidence , than i would be absolutely of another opinion . 
  in the end , the position of the us in the international system will remain as it is currently , at * least * through the end of the century . 
  here 's an example of why : [ why u.s. financial hegemony will endure , symposium magazine , fall 2013 ] ( http://www.symposium-magazine.com/why-u-s-financial-hegemony-will-endure/ ) . . and then the cheap remark about ` bullying ' , and `` helping to '' reduce instead of simply `` reducing '' . . all these weird code words inserted by people based on their own personal ideological leanings and hidden agendas . . you guys can do better than that . 
  you must really hate mitfahrgelegenheit then , oder ? 
  i was not aware of that . 
   but both the eu and russia are not currently in a state of war it is * de facto * impossible for the * eu * to be at war . 
  it is a sui generis institution , but it certainly is * not * a military alliance - it is * much * more of an economic alliance . 
  maybe you mean ` europe ' ? 
  man , that edge . 
  by ' a major ' reason , i did n't sort of mean ' * the * major reason ' . 
  i have friends who studied law , and my personal opinion is that sometimes a lawyer can be your best friend . 
  personally , i think law can be fascinating , which i would also consider to be a major reason people drift towards law . 
  i also have * major * respect for the opinions of such people , because they actually * know * what they 're talking about . 
  i was more commenting on the lameness of / r/miskimoon 's comment , being one of these general cynical opinions `` and the lawyers get wealthy '' that sounds like wisdom but it 's actually just a juvenile opinion . 
  man , you 're not the most popular person in / r/europe today xd, 
  that guy has a tattoo glorifying sep 11th ? 
  yeah , it may be ` obvious ' , but it 's really too bad that in order to hear about what is really going on in europe , i have to read an american news source . 
  do you think that is a major reason why people decide to study law ? 
  they certainly did in 2003 . 
  then cyprus joined the eu in 2004 , which the turks viewed as a slap in the face - because it was a slap in the face . 
  turkey will not join the eu in anything but the long run . 
  there are many reasons why . 
  for example , if turkey joined the eu , they would suddenly be the most powerful bloc in the european parliament . 
  ( representation by population ) turkey also blocks formal communication between nato and csdp , because cyprus is n't a member of nato . 
  the way in which turkey negotiates at the political level is - also for me - extremely frustrating . 
  would a turkey in the eu be better for the us - and actually , for the whole world ? 
  yes . 
  would a turkey in the eu be better for europe ? 
  anyway , i also agree that turkey is n't european . 
  i had an invite from a turkish girl to get a few beers last night , sweet girl , but a lot of the turkish men i have come into contact with over 5 years in germany ? 
  turkey is not a western country , and it is not european . 
  one of my best friends here is half turkish-half american , and he would probably say the same thing . 
   turkey itself only recently stopped fighting against the kurds . 
  the kurds were also fighting turkey . 
  however , i do agree that - i do n't see an independent kurdistan happening anytime soon . 
  why the kurds thought it was a good idea to start the pkk i have no idea , but they shot themselves in the foot with that one . 
  i hate your face , and so does your mom . 
  yeah , but do you see how your situation is different from op 's ? 
  btw , i 'm also in germany ( northern ) , happy oktoberfest and all that, 
  are you that stupid to think i was serious ? 
  `` the corn was used for corn '' ? 
  fuck is wrong with you people xd, 
  currently in northern germany , and currently eating herring with tomato sauce out of a tin . 
  edeka variety , less than 1 euro each . 
  do n't taste good , have to chase each bite with water , but man are these little guys a great way to get a six pack going . 
   in the us learning another language is seen as something hard to do . 
  i would say , that in the us , learning another language apart from spanish is seen as something not nearly as useful as it is for europeans . 
  did you go to poland from the us , or from the us to poland ? 
  first , we got off on the wrong foot , and i did n't say what i wanted to say exactly . 
  to put it here , this is one of my comments on the ukraine situation that does well to describe where i 'm coming from http://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/2g3z1u/why_john_j_mearsheimer_is_wrong_on_ukraine/ckflcwn in response to  if your argument is `` i 'm against intervention because it will cost my state money and effort '' i would , first of all , not say i 'm `` against intervention '' . 
  i 'd have to see the different variations of `` intervention '' , in what cases do what , but anyway . 
  the situation can change in an instant , and so for me it 's more the case that `` i 'm against intervention unless _______ . '', 
  so , we have europe , the us , and russia . 
  leaving russia aside for now , we have the morals and values of the us , the power of the us to act when those morals ( such as degree of belief in inviolability of international law and sovereignty ) are challenged . 
  then we have the same for europe/eu - morals and values , balanced by hard and soft power . 
  ( of course this applies to russia , too ) the us and europe/eu are pretty close on the values/morals side ( different variations of the same civilization ) , national interests do sometimes overlap , but not all the time .
