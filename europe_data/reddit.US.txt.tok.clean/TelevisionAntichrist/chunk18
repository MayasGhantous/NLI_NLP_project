  in fact , his whole persona centers around being strong . 
  if we gave the ukrainian side a bunch of guns , the russian media would also have a field day with it . 
  it would galvanize support of the russian cause , not only understanding , but outright support . 
  and not just in russia . 
  because actually , as it stands - and this is part of what makes putin the smart guy he is - there is no reason for there to be a lot of deaths in this conflict . 
  i 'm not saying that the casualties that have occurred somehow do n't matter - not at all . 
  i 'm saying , that the casualty rate is such that people are wondering if there actually is a * war * going on . 
  it 's bad , again , do n't get me wrong , but it could be a * lot * worse . 
  i mean , c'mon guys , there 's a lot more points to make !, 
  if the us directly arms the ukrainian side , then ukrainians are using american armaments that lead directly to the deaths of russian-backed rebels/fighters , and probably russian soldiers as well ? 
  how many russian soldiers ? 
  and everyone in the entire world , knows exactly , that the us gave those weapons to ukraine , that were to be use specifically to kill russians ? 
  guys , it 's called a * proxy * war . 
  * that * , would be close to a * direct war * between the us and russia . 
  russia would be so pissed off you ca n't believe it , and the russians would galvanize behind putin as being as great a leader as ever has been , and then you would really - for the first time - very much possibly start to see some real shit go down . 
  it was called a cold war for a reason ... krauthammer 's article *** at least flirts *** with actual hot war . 
  no way should the us throw all that gasoline on a fire that might end up burning itself out soon , in any event . 
  ukraine does n't need to blitzkrieg the russian-backed side . 
  i mean , c'mon you guys , that 's an absolutely unnecessary military conflict we are talking about . 
  was n't the whole thing about iraq , that it was unnecessary ? 
  and all of a sudden , you guys are yelling out ` us give heavy artillery and the most advanced in machine guns and body armour to a military conflict situation ? 
  i thought you guys were against such nonsense . 
  it has to do with realism - if we ca n't fix the situation , we should be very careful about what we do ... and try to side as much as possible on the side of doing actually * nothing * . 
  we have , these days , a conflict against is whatthefuckevertheycallthemselves , and that is a really important situation here , that we need to start asking ourselves * hard questions * . 
  for example , is the following sentence true or false : `` sometimes you just have to kill a motherfucker '' . 
  i believe , that the answer to that in the case of is is ` true ' . 
  a very hard question to ask yourself , and to realise , consciously , that you hold a certain position . 
  a real tough question . 
  apply that to the ukraine crisis , and for me - the answer is ` no ' . 
  in this article , krauthammer answers that question with a firm ` yes ' . 
  and he 's wrong . 
  he 's basing his logic on great power politics , in the sense that krauthammer would welcome conflict , because the us is so strong that the most likely outcome ( we 're not talking about nuclear war here or something ) would be a weakened russia . 
  and a ` strengthened ' us - a us , to krauthammer 's mind , that must act in such a way that its place in the world at the top is not questioned for as long as possible . 
  50 , 100 years . 
  at * least * . 
  and if the us whacks russia 's snout good , the whole world would see a weak russia ( emperor wears no clothes and all that ) , meaning the us would be the most powerful country for another - what ? 
  - two decades ? 
  give or take ? 
  then again in another 20 years , do some other sort of ` throwing muscle around ' , and on and on and guess what ? 
  you have a plan serving to keep the us at the top . 
  and having the us at the top is n't bad at all !, 
  however , there are different ways to go about it . 
  this ` strongman ' approach that krauthammer ( a cold war warrior ) outlines here - it 's not the best approach to a stable world-wide system over the coming decades !, 
  the better approach - i think ( and i think you guys do too ) , is the diplomatic approach . 
  putin actually is n't doing anything that deserves all out war . 
  and he knows it . 
  that 's why he 's doing it . 
  because he can . 
  and he can , indeed . 
  like 95 % of crimeans voted to join russia . 
  ( accuracy of the poll numbers i do n't know ) and now , he 's poking around to see how much further he can go , what more he can ` get away with ' , because he 's powerful enough , because russia is powerful enough . 
  and while it may not be ok , that is part of the tragedy of great power politics . 
  and that is why , realists are pessimistic . 
  because they know , that a country acts according to its power , and clashes are not just inevitable , they are what it is to be human . 
  the point is , i 'm not even sure why i have to point this out to you guys . 
  ______________________________________ if my tone from this or earlier posts is seen as ` assholeish ' or something , then i apologize , but the thing is - i was there the * whole * time , from the first news report where the name ` iraq ' is mentioned in 2001 , and on for another 16 months . 
  and during that time , man oh man , the cheerleading was horrendous . 
  the thing is , that it is hard , if not impossible , to watch , for example , cnn or msnbc or fox news during the day of - say - march 16 , 2002 . 
  to access all the day 's shows , to see everything . 
  to see who was saying what , and not only that , but the whole climate of this ` we 're going to war ' thing . 
  that was the saddest moment for me . 
  when scott ritter , retired un lead weapons inspector ( and retired marine ) in iraq from something like 1990-1994 , during an interview around late 2002 - he said `` we 're going to war '' . 
  with the authority of a marine . 
  it was palpable . 
  but the whole media circus in the run-up to the iraq war , this cacophony of voices ( oh man !, 
  if you could listen to an average glenn beck radio broadcast from anytime during 2002 !, 
  so pro-invading iraq , with all his little points , with all this certainty and passion in his voice , just for an hour just talking about why we need to go into iraq and the sooner the better now now now let 's go mount up tag em and bag em round em up hobo let god sort it all out after you leave their borken bloodied corpses piled miles high under the middle eastern midday sun !, 
  and krauthammer was right in the thick of it - using his position of responsibility in society and abusing it , pushing the us towards war , in my opinion thus completely abusing his position in society and losing my trust forevermore . 
  and he did n't capitualate !!, 
  none of these guys apologised for their cheerleading and war-mongering for iraq , they just go on giving their political opinions as if nothing happened !, 
  it 's fucking maddening !, 
  that 's what i meant , when i wrote that krauthammer makes my fucking blood boil . 
  i think it 's like , just as europeans never really understood how americans felt about 9/11 , europeans do n't really understand what it was like for - at least - around half of the country to see us after going steadily for over a year towards war with iraq . 
  all this * bullshit * on the television . 
  we watched it every day . 
  it was a very important time , somehow , and so during 2002 , we were watching as much news as possible . 
  and for someone against the idea of invading boots on the ground tens of thousands of troops in full scale military intervention on the ground in iraq with the specified purpose of regime change ... can you guys imagine how fucking maddening it was to listen to it all , to watch it all , to see it all unfold , until one day in spring 2003 the news had night vision live video of baghdad in a green nvg hue with explosions raining down from american pilots ? 
  yeah , you guys did n't have to sit through two years of charles krauthammer in the run-up to the 2003 iraq war , you did n't have to sit through him bleating on about what a good idea it was to re-elect bush in 2004 , you did n't have to sit through him for the first decade of the 2000s where everything he said was a neoconservative talking point . . you did n't have to sit through him talking about how good of a candidate sarah palin would be . . 
  though the recent issue with ukraine could be one which brings republicans and democrats together , you europeans just do n't know who these people are , what they have said in the past , and what they stand for . 
  i 've heard krauthammer talk on fox news , probably a good fifty or 100 times , and every time , that fucker makes my blood boil . 
  and here , on / r/europe , you 're posting articles of his as though none of that matters . 
  there is *** no way *** i was trying to  corner the guy into a fox news watching neocon just because he agrees with the dude on this . 
  my point was , that you europeans have to research what it is that you are talking about . 
  and who is providing the ammunition with which you are continuing attack . 
  what 's next ? 
  using rush limbaugh as a source , just because you believe in some particular point that he 's making ? 
  i 'm sure i do n't disagree with him on * everything * , but lord knows i 'm not going to use him as a source or quote him . 
  *** that *** is my problem . 
  alles klar ? 
  you 're kidding , right ? 
  ( i ca n't tell if you 're serious or not ) if you 're serious , - mate !!!, 
  a lot of the time it is * very * ** fucking ** *** difficult *** to figure out what people are really saying - especially when they are professional political talking heads . 
  for example , krauthammer supported the idea , back in july , of [ sending tens of millions of dollars in arms ] ( http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/07/17/krauthammer_on_ukraine_the_least_obama_could_do_is_make_a_damned_decision_for_once_in_his_life.html ) to the ukrainian rebels . 
  i 'm not sure if you would have supported that or not , but one thing is for sure , there would have been many , many more deaths , and the us would be much more ` front and center ' vis-a-vis russia than is the case today . 
  there would have been a much greater war than has been the case . 
  ( it 's actually been quite tame , considering the possibilities ) do you * realise * that this is what the article linked here is implying ? 
  do you * realise * that agreeing with this article puts you square in the camp of the us neocons and the much abhorred boogeyman `` fox news '' ? 
   a little over the top but makes quite a lot of good points . 
  that 's what a lot of people in the us thought of krauthammer 's arguments for going into iraq in the lead-up 2001/2 . 
  maybe you should do your *** research ***,
