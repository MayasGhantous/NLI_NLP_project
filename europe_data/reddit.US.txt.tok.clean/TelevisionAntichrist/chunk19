  its funny to me , when europeans post articles intended to make the us look bad . . and that article is written by noted neoconservatives , stalwarts of fox news , dyed in the wool republicans , etc. 
  i 've even noticed people referencing rush limbaugh . 
  but this unfortunate trend underlies a deeper feeling/suspicion of mine , in that as long as they like the feeling in their gut , the european left does n't really care who is delivering the message . 
  it 's a huge disappointment for me , personally . 
  ( after having spent five years in europe and there currently ), 
  and laser cats, 
  what a snotty , unreliable article . 
  ( published by asia times ) though i did like this part :  outstanding mediocrity jose manuel barroso . . i still wonder who the sanctimonious and irrelevant author supports in this world ? 
  i want to talk about [ global public goods ] ( https://www.globalpolicy.org/social-and-economic-policy/global-public-goods-1-101.html ) for a second , in relation to oil . 
  before i do , i just want to say that it is precisely the idea of global public goods ( gpgs ) , that the european left seems to have - for whatever reason - zero interest in learning or learning about . 
  this is because , perhaps , they may feel somehow guilty , as they themselves ( if european , anyway ) are aboslutely recipients of global public goods , furnished by the usa . 
  however , the gpgs furnished by the usa impact every facet of the societies of usa/canada and europe : it 's like telling a fish they 're swimming in water . 
  anyway , regarding oil and your comment . 
  it is n't the price increase , * per se * , that would concern the u.s. we 'd basically be fine . 
  ( more on this point later ) what would concern us , is that oil price volatility ( on global energy markets ) may lead to instability . 
  possibly global instability . 
  the phrase ` global instability ' is very wide , and in some ways vague , but i mean it in the sense of if the 2008 recession had indeed become a true global economic depression . 
  ( i.e. 
  if keynesian economic policies had not been implemented by bush ii and obama ) so , iraq 's annual output is a little over a billion barrels of oil a year . 
  ( remember , the us 's annual expenditure is 7 billion , produces around 3 billion domestically ) if oil prices went way up , you 'd probably start to see flash points around asia , with china in a very bad spot . 
  europeans would be hit pretty bad , too - much worse than the us . 
  and then a whole slew of problems starts to show up around the world . 
  many , many people would suffer . 
  who knows what could happen - in the worst case scenario , it might lead to a collapse of the liberal international system . 
  this is the global public good that the us has provided the world , since it became caretaker of the liberal international system devised by the dutch in the 1600s which the british then ran with for a solid 200 years until roughly the end of ww2 . 
  ( by the way , there were four challengers to this system in the 20th century - imperial germany , soviet russia , nazi germany and imperial japan ) however , such a case will not happen in anything but possibly the long term ( in terms of oil prices skyrocketing and directly resulting in global depression ) , 2100 at earliest . 
  it wo n't because countries like iraq simply * wo n't * ( if they still * have * oil , anyway )  just stop producing oil . 
  it 's the engine that runs their countries . 
  without that money , they 're fucked . 
  so when you say that  suddenly , the us will find out that the 40 % of oil that it imports will have become much more expensive this is the wrong perspective , because you imply that the us is worried about its oil for selfish reasons . 
  that 's just the surface reason . 
  the real reason is global . 
  with that said , regarding the iraq war , the whole ` no war for oil ! ', 
  sprichwort is superficial . 
  it was part of the calculus of course , but at the same time , i never heard about saddam hussein threatening to `` just stop producing oil . '', 
  he had [ threatened to cut off the oil supply to turkey in 2000 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1376638/bully-saddam-theatens-to-cut-off-oil-supply.html ) and in the same year he said that he wanted to sell his oil in euros instead of dollars , but i do n't think he ever threatened to stop oil production . 
  rather , the iraq war was fought mostly - as far as i can tell - for revenge for 9/11 and because we could . 
  that 's why i disagreed with it . 
  that 's why i think the ` no war for oil ' cry is bullshit - it was inaccurate . 
  it should have been ` no war for revenge ! ', 
  so when you write  tldr ; iraqi oil does n't need to be flowing to the us for the country to benefit . 
  you are * completely * ignoring the benefits that canada , europe , and australia/nz ( to the greatest extent in comparison with the rest of the world , anyway ) receive from global oil price stability . 
  and * that * is what i do n't like . 
  i do n't like when europeans talk about the u.s. in terms of its core and vital national interests as if europe does n't possess the very same core and vital national interests . 
  as such , i would write your sentence like : tldr ; iraqi oil does n't need to be flowing to the us or to canada or to europe or to australia for the countries to benefit . 
  so with that said , what 's your point ? 
  it just felt like such a stupid vapid fucking question to ask at this particular time , i had to say something . 
  and by ` say something ' , i mean jerk it to your message to me here about / r/thefappening . 
  i 'll reply in a few minutes . . in the meantime , have you read this article ? 
  it is * very * important , because - for the first time - this article ( america do n't come home ( 2013 ) ) describes to the t , the united states ' motivations and reasons behind its grand strategy . 
  it is an ` answer ' to the 1997 daryl press article [ ` come home america ' ] ( http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dpress/docs/press_come_home_america_is.pdf ) , and these are the ` two sides ' in the ` retrenchment - non-retrenchment ' debate going on in the us about its future role in the world . 
  [ stephen g. brooks , g. john ikenberry , and william c. wohlforth . 
  `` do n't come home , america : the case against retrenchment . '', 
  international security 37 , no . 
  3 ( winter 2012/13 ) : 7 -- 51 . 
  ] ( / / belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/22595/dont_come_home_america.html ) it 's from the information in these two articles , describing the world and how the us approaches it considering its wealth , that my perspective comes from . 
  goddamn the european left today is so disappointing . . you guys can barely put together a complete sentence , much less defend your political beliefs . 
  the us does n't need oil from the me . 
  nor do we want it . 
  you 're thinking of _________ . 
  the u.s. imported roughly 3 billion barrels of oil in 2013 . 
  60 % of the oil the u.s. uses is produced domestically . 
  so roughly , the u.s. used 7 billion ( 6.89 ) barrels of oil in 2013 . 
  from that , the u.s. imported 124 million barrels from the u.s. . that is 0.017 % . 
  iraq - 0.017 % saudi arabia - roughly 5 % . 
  kuwait - [ about same as iraq ] no other middle eastern countries figure in . 
  5 % * is * something , from saudi arabia , and i would like to see that figure ever-lower . 
  however , if you think that the u.s. is somehow fighting wars in the middle east for 0.017 % of our annual oil consumption , you can . 
  [ source ] ( http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/2014/08/29/the-worlds-largest-oil-producer-is/ ) does n't mean that you 're saying something accurate , though . 
  but if bashing the u.s. is just part of your identity , no matter the argument , then i 'm not going to stop you . 
  it makes you sound dumb , though . 
  if you think we 're not serious when we say we 're serious , maybe you have not been paying attention . 
  what kind of a question is this ? 
  the world 's burning and you 're asking about fireworks ?

  are you joshing ? 
  do n't worry much about / u/tachyonburst . . he 's a 9/11 kook, 
  you 're done . 
  the `` dude '' i 'm contesting is afraid to put his name on an article on the internet he wrote . 
  but if 9/11 conspiracy theories make your nipples hard , do n't let me get in the way of your session, 
  take a look at your downvotes , pal . 
  anyway , not for you but more just to post , my gut feeling on the collapse of a building : if one floor of a building high above the ground collapses , the floor underneath it either collapses instantaneously , or does n't collapse at all . 
  it seems to me , that it is * not * the case , that the floor underneath would stay firm for a half of a second , or a second , or whatever small fraction of time - if it is going to collapse . 
  * especially * if those floors are connected to the same column/girder system which caused the failure of the first floor in the first place . 
  therefore , again in my opinion , a progressive collapse may absolutely mimic a ` free-fall ' collapse . 
  but if you want , you can post another link to a random internet website that * specifically * does n't mention the author 's name . 
  wtc7 : uncontrolled fires caused the thermal expansion of steel floor beams and structural girders . 
  this led :  to a chain of events that caused a key structural column to fail . 
  the failure of this structural column then initiated a fire-induced progressive collapse of the entire building . 
   according to the report 's probable collapse sequence , heat from the uncontrolled fires caused thermal expansion of the steel beams on the lower floors of the east side of wtc 7 , damaging the floor framing on multiple floors . 
   eventually , a girder on floor 13 lost its connection to a critical column , column 79 , that provided support for the long floor spans on the east side of the building ( see diagram 1 ) . 
  the displaced girder and other local fire-induced damage caused floor 13 to collapse , beginning a cascade of floor failures down to the 5th floor . 
  many of these floors had already been at least partially weakened by the fires in the vicinity of column 79 . 
  this collapse of floors left column 79 insufficiently supported in the east-west direction over nine stories . 
   the unsupported column 79 then buckled and triggered an upward progression of floor system failures that reached the building 's east penthouse . 
  what followed in rapid succession was a series of structural failures . 
  failure first occurred all the way to the roof line-involving all three interior columns on the easternmost side of the building ( 79 , 80 , 81 ) . 
  then , progressing from east to west across wtc 7 , all of the columns failed in the core of the building ( 58 through 78 ) . 
  finally , the entire fa\u00e7ade collapsed .
