  i like poland . 
  i was disappointed when i thought that / u/cybertroll was polish . 
  then i realised he was greek . 
  i like poland * much * more than i like germany , and i live in germany . 
  in the u.s. 's defense re : solidarno\u015b\u0107  in its clandestine years , the united states provided significant financial support for solidarity , estimated to be as much as 50 million us dollars . 
  ( from the wiki entry ) with that said , poland is one of * my * favorite countries in the world . 
  ok . greek . 
  hey , speaking of books , here 's one you guys should read [ economics in one lesson : the shortest and surest way to understand basic economics ] ( http://www.amazon.com/economics-one-lesson-shortest-understand-ebook/dp/b003xt60ko/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1409663510&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=economics+101 ), 
  you 're that polish guy !, 
  hey - while you 're busy slamming the usa on the internet for everything you can think of , maybe you can take a second and thank the u.s. for being the major force which , today , allows you to have the freedom to do so . 
  or maybe you 'd like to drop-out of nato and re-join russia 's sphere of influence ? 
  you 'd totally be able to sell your apples again !, 
  and you could bash the fuck out of the u.s. on the internet without being called out as a hypocrite !, 
  would n't that be cool , bro ? 
  from that answer , i * know * that you have not so much as read a book on the jfk assassination . 
  however , i 'm almost sure that you 've seen the movie and that you * have * read a few things here and there . . 
  i guess you 're a structural engineer with many years experience in the field ? 
  or , rather , maybe you 're just a kid ? 
   and now it is commonly accepted that it was in fact an inside job from us right-wing extremists and cia . 
  this is untrue . 
  do n't worry little buddy !, 
  one day you 'll get into space and * when * you do - we 'll be there clapping along with everyone else !, 
  this is a pretty strong statement , for for it to have true meaning , it would yeah ( re : / u/fuku22us333hima ) have to be said by merkel . 
  how cute . 
  you seem to be forgetting that [ the eu is a small power , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_european_union_as_a_small_power ) more able to be likened to a country like sweden or argentina . 
  you europeans on / r/europe are funny . 
  you 're a particular demographic that gives great support to such concepts as ` european integration ' ( unlike ` most ' europeans ) . 
  however , the biggest counter-force to ` integration ' is sovereignty . 
  there are a myriad of problems with the idea of an ` fully integrated european army ' . 
  the first of which , is that a nation 's army is the last and most important aspect of a nation 's sovereignty . 
  this is something that no european country will ever give up - to the extent that is needed to have a fully integrated european army . 
  there are n't many euro-skeptics on this subreddit , so most of you guys are very pro-eu/pro-eu integration . 
  however , most of the european public is either just warm/lukewarm about the whole european integration project . 
  most europeans - of course ( ! ), 
  are absolutely not willing to give up the most important part of sovereignty to brussels . 
  plus , it seems to me that the greatest impetus behind the idea of a fully integrated european military , is * simply * to be able to stand up to the u.s. in a political sense and to have a feeling of being somehow equal to the u.s. in terms of military power . 
  this is part of what i mean by ` funny ' . 
  there 's much more to say on that topic , but another issue - do you think that it 's so easy to get 27 countries to agree to undertake a military mission ? 
  the eu is condemned to requiring the agreement of 27 member states in order to undertake any civilian or military operations . 
  the tooth-less csdp is a look inside how absolutely impossible it would be to have a fully-integrated eu army . 
  you guys can still talk about it as though it 's possible , though . 
  no one is going to stop you , i guess . 
  ** edit : ** if you would like to down-vote me , care to say why ? 
   the two regions are very culturally different and have fundamentally opposed concepts of right and wrong . 
  when you write this way , you make it sound as though you are comparing europe to * china * . 
  i would take peter baldwin 's ( 2009 ) `` antidote for the usual assumptions '' about the relationship between the usa and europe . 
  the book is called [ the narcissism of minor differences : how america and europe are alike ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-narcissism-minor-differences-america/dp/b008sltv8a ) . 
  i 've lived in europe for five years as an american ( northern germany ) , and in all this time , i have not really noticed anything i would call a * major * difference . . there are many differences , of course , but the differences i have noticed have all been what i would consider as being relatively minor . 
  when i was in china in 2005 , you 'd go to the little pharmacy there , the apotheke , and there would not be bottles of aspirin and vitamins and cough syrup on display ... nope . 
  instead , they had numerous little boxes laid out like a candy shop with various eastern medicines . . such as starfish to be ground up , antlers/antler pieces to be ground up ( made as tea ? 
  ) , various dried plants , herbs , hocus pocus up the yazoo . 
  that ( i.e. 
  eastern vs. western medicine ) , i do consider a * major * difference . 
  here in europe , i see only minor differences - and many more similarities than i think that us both sides like to admit ( ! ),

  / u/ideologicalexperimen is just some american kid who has problems and blames those problems on murica . 
  i think that most of the ` europeans ' i see writing comments are probably hormonal 16 year old kids living in the suburbs . 
  great point , mate . 
  the ease in which certain infrastructures could be used as a way for citizens to affect international politics , i.e. 
  blowing up trans-national gas pipelines , is definitely an important aspect of this conflict . 
  well , to be fair . . now it 's 14 . 
  this is probably my favorite self-written text post on / r/europe pretty much ever . 
  there is nothing here i do not fully agree with . 
  brilliant analysis , mate . 
   for example you are not our ally . 
  what country ? 
   but lets not be facetious what you did was out of self interest . 
  this old half truth again ? 
  listen buddy , every country is led by self interest . 
  it 's because the us and canada are different variations of the same civilization shared with europe , many same morals , that many national interests of many different western nations overlap . 
  but do n't think for a second that everything your leaders of your country are doing , they are not doing out of your country 's national interest . 
  the idea that the u.s. is somehow the only country in the west who acts out of self interest is pure fucking bullshit . 
  the marshall aid plan was conceived and implemented for a myriad of different reasons , only one of which had to do with `` preventing the soviet union from taking all of europe '' . 
  the reasons are enough to fill a book - as i 'm certain many books have been filled with the topic specifically of the marshall aid plan . 
  to talk of it with such superficiality , as though many layers did n't exist and it was just about `` the soviet union , maaaaaaaaan ! '', 
  is just that - ueberflaechlich . 
  and disappointing that obviously some europeans have n't studied it , yet use it as a specific example in forming their world-view . 
  ( and using it as a point to bash the us ) maybe you 're leaving out the other aspects of the marshall aid plan , because to include them would make the us look better than you 're trying to make it look ? 
  also , thanks for spying on hillary clinton and john kerrry ... those conversations were private , germany !, 
  i wonder who else the government of germany is spying on ? 
  at least the entire country of turkey , for starters ... are you german ? 
  the isil fighters are yelling out `` sykes-picot !, 
  funny that , the name `` picot '' does n't sound american . . oh well ... it 's still *** all *** the fault of the u.s. 
  maaaaaaaaaaaan !!!!, 
  it 's this ` full-stop ' attitude , which i really ca n't stand about europe . 
  i 've lived here for 5 years , and will be going back home in about two months . 
  of course , your answer does n't take into consideration the history of the situation , why iraq almost * needed * a strongman like hussein to govern in the first place . 
  that had to do with how the brits and europeans cut up africa and the middle east like a cake , cramming together different peoples within the same nation . 
  so fucking superficial . 
  your answer also does not take into account how much the u.s. has done for europe , and continues to do for europe ( i.e. 
  by providing ` global public goods ' , such as keeping global shipping lanes open thus ensuring european supermarkets are packed and stocked top to bottom with food . 
  gas is n't expensive in europe because the u.s. is n't doing a good job ensuring that the european economy is never want for energy ... it 's expensive because the government taxes it at a rate of 50 % ( at least in germany ) ) . 
  it also does n't take into consideration , that we are actually * military * allies . 
  though such sentiment is sure to receive a bunch of upvotes on / r/europe , it also makes me fucking sick . 
  what a sanctimonius stupid article, 
  this . 
  good question , questeion . 
  man , how do you handle these responses , all of which are like out of left field . 
  the guy started talking about pearl harbor ?
