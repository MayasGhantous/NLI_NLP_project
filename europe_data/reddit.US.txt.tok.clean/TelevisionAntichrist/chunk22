   my pov concerning fracking is identical to my pov concerning mtr . 
   i do not care . 
  as long as they do not start it here . 
  ok , so you still do n't get it . 
  * anything * which affects your country positively as a result of international trade , trade taking place within the international system , is something which you must take a position on . 
  if you do n't , then you 're simply saying `` i do n't care !, 
  '' , putting your hands up , and admitting that you are simply refusing to think about the issue . 
  in other words , to not have an opinion on such matters - especially regarding where your country gets its energy sources from - is a weasel move . 
  according to your ` posts ' ( i ca n't call your posts an argument because it 's much too simple ) , i would * infer * that you * support * fracking in the united states . 
  this is because it effects your country positively , and you support that positivity . 
  i * highly doubt * that you have ever told anyone in your life that you support fracking in the u.s. , because it makes coal cheaper for germany to buy on the international market . 
  in fact , i would bet that you have only bitched against fracking in the u.s. . that makes you a two-faced hypocrite . 
  unless you can say here and forever that you more support u.s. fracking than do n't support it . 
  well well , we have identified the problem , have n't we ? 
  you  thought give me some reliable sources which says this is true , that mtr mining accounts * predominantly * for `` falling '' coal prices . 
  oh yeah , that 's right , there are n't any . 
  you guys are just exasperating . 
  the reason that coal prices have been falling as of late , is because of america 's *** fracking revolution *** . 
  to not get into too much detail : [ america 's gas boom has prompted its coal miners to seek new export markets , sending prices plunging on world markets . 
  so long as consumers do not pay for coal 's horrible side-effects , that makes it irresistibly cheap . 
  in germany power from coal now costs half the price of watts from a gas-fired power station . 
  it is a paradox that coal is booming in a country that in other respects is the greenest in europe . 
  its production of power from cheap , dirty brown coal ( lignite ) is now at 162 billion kilowatt hours , the highest since the days of the decrepit east germany . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/business/21600987-cheap-ubiquitous-and-flexible-fuel-just-one-problem-fuel-future ) germany is whole-heartedly *** against fracking *** , yet , as it turns out , germany benefits tremendously from fracking . 
  germany does n't like the idea , so it makes us a story that cheap prices are the result of mtr mining . 
  then the german media repeats that lie , and germans do n't look into the truth , because the lie makes them feel good . 
  this is called hypocrisy . 
  so , again , it seems that i 'm only getting half of the truth - if that - from a german guy about international politics . 
   also , maybe you do n't believe in the concept of self-determination and do n't care what the crimeans and eastern ukrainians want for their future ? 
  according to an eastern ukrainian i had coffee with today , her concept of self-determination and her future involves putin keeping the fuck away from inside the borders of ukraine . 
  also , putin shot down a planefull of eu citizens . 
  fuck putin and his geopolitics , and fuck your inability to understand , much less elucidate , your own position on the situation . 
  and you do that by highlighting an extraction method that accounts for only 5-10 % of u.s. consumption , and i 'm guessing - since the rest of the world uses coal and does n't mine by mtr mining - a method used for like ( i 'm guessing ) 0.5 % of world consumption ? 
  your point was to say coal `` is plenty and the price of coal is falling '' by highlighting mtr mining in the u.s. ? 
  what planet are you from ? 
  first of all , the u.s. will never export remotely large amounts of coal mined using the technique of mountaintop removal mining . 
  information recently [ came to light that some companies * were * exporting such coal , ] ( http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2012/new-congressional-report-reveals-dirty-mountaintop-removal-coal-exported ) and while in relatively small amounts , this is a highly politically sensitive topic . 
  as such , mtr coal exports to germany will likely never reach more than a few percent of total u.s. coal exports to germany ( and that number is even too high - it should be zero ! ), 
  second of all , according to your wikipedia link  almost half of the electricity generated in the united states is produced by coal-fired power plants . 
  mtr accounted for less than 5 % of u.s. coal production as of 2001 . 
  [ 10 ] in some regions , however , the percentage is higher , for example mtr provided 30 % of the coal mined in west virginia in 2006 . 
  [ 16 ] so , if the u.s. generates around 50 % of its electricity from `` coal '' , and of that amount , only 5 % ( barring a few regions ) is mined using dirty mountaintop removal coal , what are the methods of mining the other 95 % ? 
  why do n't you mention those , i wonder ? 
  why just mention the absolutely worst method of coal extraction - even though that method accounts for a tiny percentage of u.s. consumption and an even less percentage of methods used to mine coal in the u.s. destined to be exported to foreign markets ? 
  is it because you 're trying to make a cheap and superficial deutschreddit jab against the u.s. ? 
  you make it sound like all u.s. coal imports to germany will come from mtr mining . 
  then you say i imagine that that is what you infer * here :  not in germany . 
  no chance . 
  but we have a lot of coal . 
  and we really like coal , because it is cheap as fuck , thanks to american mountain-top-mining . 
  do you think i ca n't fucking read english or something ? 
  i 've lived in germany for five years , and the thing i really ca n't stand is how you germans weasel yourselves out of anything resembling a guilty position regarding international politics while attempting to place the blame on the u.s. ( another example being the situation with the [ german trade surplus ] ( http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2012/new-congressional-report-reveals-dirty-mountaintop-removal-coal-exported ) ) it is an insult - an insult to the intelligence of / r/europe readers - that you * infer * that germany 's overall coal consumption is inexpensive * precisely * because germany is importing and burning enourmous amounts of appalachian mtr coal . 
  that is n't true . 
  but fuck me , right ? 
  * infer : deduce or conclude ( information ) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements . 
  yeah . 
  currently lives and studies in germany , goes back home frequently . 
  who do you think you are to make statements agreeing with putin 's opinion that ukraine is for all intents and purposes russia ? 
  i bet you were screaming and bleating on about how it was wrong for bush to invade a sovereign nation , oder ? 
  or , rather , maybe you do n't believe in the concept of sovereignty ? 
  perhaps cherry-pick exceptions to the concept as you see fit ? 
  so you give up your nuclear energy , and just plan on importing coal from russia , thereby giving russia immense global power and influence in germany ? 
  i also missed the billboards from the green party with the tagline `` black coal is the future ! '', 
  you do this , all the while , denigrating u.s. methods of extracting * black * coal ( more environmentally friendly than * brown * coal ) , while saying nothing of germany 's distasteful practices as illuminated in the video i liked ? 
  on top of all that , you do n't specify the percentages of how much germany is projected to buy from russia , and how much from the u.s. half-truth on reddit much ? 
   not in germany . 
  no chance . 
  but we have a lot of coal . 
  and we really like coal , because it is cheap as fuck , thanks to american mountain-top-mining . 
  well , you 're right - germany does have a lot of ` brown ' coal . 
  in fact , here 's a short 5 minute nyt report on the brown coal situation in germany . 
  the synopsis :  germany is in the midst of an unprecedented shift to renewable energy , but is still dependent on brown coal . 
  the village of atterwasch may become a victim of germany 's hunger for brown coal . 
  [ germany 's coal addiction ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000002712593/germanys-coal-addiction.html ) so , tell me how again this is the fault of the u.s. ? 
  what is your pretty little mouth talking about , when you write `` mountain-top-mining '' ? 
  are you taking unfounded digs against the u.s. on reddit to make you feel more like innocent 80 million population germany has no choice again ? 
  we talked about this, 
  you 'd be surprised what a ten or fifty or whatever billion dollar injection into an economy ( over a relatively short term , i.e. 
  ~ 2 years ) do for [ international ] investor confidence . 
  money tends to beget more money . 
  and that money is * in-turn * used to re-invest yet again back into the same economy . 
  some of these investments are used to create businesses which did n't previously exist , and they ca n't do all the work themselves !, 
  they got to hire people . 
  you 'd be surprised at the ingenuity of modern professional entrepreneurs , and a lot of time they make good choices on what to invest in , so the businesses many times prosper over at least the short and medium-terms . 
  free market capitalism and all that . 
  i am very concerned with balancing regulations and ` first , doing no harm ' to the economy ( i.e. 
  [ the flexi-curity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flexicurity ) debate ) . 
  so that 's where i think the focus on all things ttip should * also * include - i.e. 
  what is permissible to europeans , and what is n't : will you * only * accept a full across-the-board `` no !, 
  '' , or are there some things you may be willing to accept in a compromise ? 
  you know the * truuuuuth maaaaaaaaaaan *, 
  i do n't know what you mean . 
  negotiations are ongoing . 
  i guess i 'll just be down-voted for suggesting that the proposal might actually * help * europe in some respects , though . . 
  we just have to approach this thing like realists - both americans and europeans alike !, 
  if its a bad deal , then lets scrap it and come together against it . 
  if not , well ... we 'll just have to wait and see . 
  we do n't know what it will look like , how positive the positives will be and vice-versa , but it should n't be looked at as a purely negative possible agreement . . it deserves a closer look . 
  for example : http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/september/tradoc_151787.pdf it may create several million jobs , dependent on exports , and may be beneficial to the tune of 99 billion euros . 
  do you realize you just described 90 % of the interaction on / r/europe ?
