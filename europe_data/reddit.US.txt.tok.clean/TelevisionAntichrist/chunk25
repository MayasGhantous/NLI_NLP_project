  little known fact : the soviets in the east killed or captured roughly the same number of nazi soldiers as the other allies ( us , brits , canada , etc. ), 
  did in the west . 
  more were killed on the eastern front , and more were captured on the western front . 
  at the table with the other cool kids, 
  well , you guys have [ stackenblocken ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qen5-_93gqg ) , a pretty funny game show . . 
  blonde is the best jaja !!, 
  [ black is the worst colour , brunette is standard and most of them colour their hair blond which usually doesnt look all that good and blonde is the best colour ( only true if it 's really blonde and not some dark blonde mix ( stra\u00dfenk\u00f6terblond as we call it in germany ) .

  by saying ` not even kidding ' , do you mean that you 're just kidding ? 
   did the top brass think ukraine was a desert ? 
  unbelievable . 
  how about the us provides the $ 100k humvee , ukraine provides the $ 12 paintjob . 
  deal ? 
   the quick descent is also apparently about as quick as the plane would allow you to do a nose dive . . 
  according to this [ article ] ( http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2015/03/audio_desperate_pilot_tried_to_get_in_cockpit ) that 's not true  john hansman , an aeronautics professor with the massachusetts institute of technology , said the descent itself was not alarming . 
   `` the descent took about eight minutes , which is a medium-fast descent , '' he said . 
  `` they lost contact at about 6,000 feet , '' but no distress call was received . 
  `` that 's one of the questions , '' hansman said . 
  `` were they too busy ? 
  was there a problem with the radios , or was there something else ? 
  were they incapacitated by smoke or depressurized cabin ? '', 
  moreover though , with that aside , i think you make an excellent point about the symbiotic nature of the development of the roles of the us and europe in the last 70 years . 
  double the autobahns to have fun on !, 
  i get your point , i 'm not trying to be rude . 
  but if you use a specific term that has a definition , you have to adhere to the definition no matter how you feel , is all i 'm saying . 
  and if you 're talking about the european union being a ` soft power ' , you have to either reconcile that somehow with the eu actually using ` hard power ' ( vis-a-vis russia and iran , for example ) or use different words . 
  welp . . that did n't go over very well, 
   the eu consisting of soft power as a side note , the leveling of economic sanctions is an expression of hard power , not soft power . 
  did you just spell that with an e ? 
   `` the last time that vehicles like this came to the czech republic , they were soviet tanks coming to crush moves towards democracy in 1968 . 
  ** we do n't want ** such vehicles from foreign armies coming here ever again , '' said tana bednarova from the ` world without wars and without violence ' organization . 
  since when was being protected by tanks about something you wanted . 
  i think its more about something you need . 
  and if tana bednarova and the organisation she is with was truly about a world without wars and without violence , i 'm sure they would have already issued a large amount of withering condemnations of the actions of isil . 
  i think that what they mean is a czech republic without wars or violence , and i 'm also sure at the same time the members of that ground thinks that even cr 's paltry 1.2 % gdp defense spending is too much . 
  edit : well i do have to give ms. bednarova some credit , and it seems she 's deserving of all the money ( even if it is 5 or 10 thousand euros a year ) that i 'm * sure * she 's receiving in her position with the organisation ( i doubt she 's doing it totally free ) . 
  in 2009 , her organisation put on an event in prage called `` light in the future '' , attended by 800 people , celebrating the international day of non-violence ( observed by all un member states lol ) . 
  it seems that day in prague three things were accomplished - one , 800 people felt good about themselves through zero effort ; two , tana bednarova increased her personal profile and standing through the staging of the event and an hour-long interview on czech public radio which took place after the event ... and three :  [ the event also sent a good wish to an african country guinea-conakry , which has recently experienced violent riots . 
  ] ( http://www.theworldmarch.org/?secc=october2&amp;acc=verid&amp;octid=215 ) i 'm sure she even believes all her quatsch - it seems to me that she 's is n't doing what she 's doing to make herself feel good , as opposed to doing ` actual ' good in the world . 
  those us tanks are exactly in-line with the idea of non-violence , because if they 're not there , nato does n't exist , the us is isolationist , the czech republic is gon na have a bad time . 
  i was thinking about where to begin , so i 'll begin here , as good a place as any . 
  on the subject of ` great men ' and history . 
  on the topic of trying to explain the development of civilization from its roots 50,000 years ago until today , or the last ten or five thousand years , there is an argument between giving credit to ` great men ' , or arguing that those individuals were actually relatively unimportant . 
  for example , should one give credit to the invention of the steam engine to thomas savery ( 1698 ) , the actual inventor , denis papin ( 1690 ) who invented the pressure cooker , or should you give credit to all the little inventions and steps forward that had to have been taken before hand , over the course of an enourmous time period , that led up to the possibility of those men being ` able ' to invent those things ? 
  the argument against the ` great men ' thesis is the one that is more popular today , and is set forth in such works as jerod diamond 's * guns , germs and steel . 
  * the argument has to do with a though process something like that if it was n't those individuals , it would have been someone else , the current of history is too strong , and in a counter-factual scenario , if none of the ` great men ' who 's names we know had ever existed , there would have simply been others who would have stepped up to the plate , and today we would know those names instead . 
  one example , is if hitler had never been born , there would have still been those forces at play in europe , like a powder keg , the exact same forces which led to the second world war . 
  it 's not for nothing that british prime minister lloyd george , over what he saw as the unnecessarily harsh terms of the versailles treaty , said `` we shall have to fight another war in 25 years time . '' my point here , is that we think about leaders such as putin , and we think about how powerful they are -- just look at what he 's doing today . 
  when i was in germany not long ago , a german guy said to me that he thought that russia is the most powerful country in the world today . 
  i disagree . 
  russia 's power comes from its natural resources , and its manpower , as opposed to technology or capital . 
  we are seeing in ukraine actually in some ways how relatively weak russia is today , with a gdp equal to that of italy and a population roughly three times that of italy ( and nobody thinks of italy as being a ` rich country ' in the same way they do about a country like norway ) . 
  so , what i 'm trying to say is that in no way is russia today more powerful than germany , russia is heavily constrained as to what it can and ca n't do by the united states and the alliances built by the us ( in a way that was n't necessarily true during the cold war ) which includes an alliance with germany ( which is less-strong than the alliances between the us and britain or the us and france , for example ) , and putin does n't really matter so much . 
  so , though there 's more i could say , what i mean here is that germany is today more powerful than russia . 
  where france and the uk is concerned , those countries get much of their power from their bi-lateral alliances with the us , where germany derives less of its overall power from , so in my view , in a bi-lateral match up where alliances do n't exist , germany is stronger than france , and germany is stronger than the uk , if power is measured * inter alia * by capital , technology , natural resources and manpower . 
  we can also talk about china as being the number two greatest power on the planet , as opposed to germany . 
  surely , that is a huge topic , and i 'm willing to bet that most people think that china , not russia , is the number two most powerful country on earth . 
  there are many arguments i am willing to entertain , for example when chomsky calls the chinese population the most valuable natural resource on the planet . 
  i forget which interview that is from but i 'm pretty sure he said that . 
  in doing so , he was combining the two ` power ' factors of natural resources and manpower . 
  another point to be made about ` natural resources ' and china 's power , is that for the us , both the atlantic and pacific oceans are natural resources for the us and its power . 
  not only to they allow for the ` monroe doctrine ' and the us being the only regional hegemon in the world , but if china ever wanted to invade the us , they would have to go over the pacific ocean or through alaska -- a prospect , especially with such technology as the rail gun , that will never happen unless somehow china successfully engages in nuclear war with the us first . 
  pretty much not gon na happen ( but again , the counter-factual thought experiment makes understanding the us defense budget a little bit easier ) . 
  china gets much of its power today from the fact that the us wants to be the only ` regional hegemon ' in the world . 
  much of the power enjoyed by the us is derived from being the sole regional hegemon , such as the us navy being the only navy in the world with the global ` freedom to roam ' . 
  if it were n't for interference by the us , the chinese navy would have been built up to such a point , that if not threatened by an equally strong coalition , it would have the global freedom to roam , and there would for example frequently be headlines about chinese naval ships off the coast of europe , etc. 
  but people today are talking about the ` pivot to asia ' , a lot of focus is on china , but it 's precisely * because * china does n't have that power ( yet ) , that its getting all this attention . 
  if china had the power -- we think it would use it . 
  i argue that germany has the power , and is on purpose not using it ( though the us certainly does limit germany 's foreign policy through nato , nato is n't necessarily a be-all end-all . 
  just look at the discourse regarding nato during the 20 years after the fall of the soviet union ) . 
  germany certainly receives much ` soft power ' by not using ` hard power ' , but will european countries like germany * always * be like that ? 
  a quick point about germany - structural realists say that economic power , or capital , is an excellent measure of power itself , because that money can quickly be turned into military power . 
  on russia and germany , germany has a very complex relationship with russia . 
  i talk about a military alliance between germany and russia being the only thing that has ever scared the us , because an alliance between the two - german capital , german technology , russian natural resources , and russian ( / german ) manpower . . that is an alliance which , in terms of total war , has the power to overturn the us-led international system . 
  one can really not say that about any other theoretical bi-lateral military alliance . 
  again , there is more that i could write here , but maybe you get my point . 
  one thing i will say about russia-germany , is i guess a controversial statement . 
  it 's not even something i 've ever heard before , and it 's probably not something i would stand up and say at an academic security and defense conference . . but in some ways , hitler did the us the biggest favor he possibly could have . 
  he had an alliance with stalin , as we all know . 
  it is that betrayal that liberalism is in some way indebted to , because imagine if instead of fighting stalin , hitler was fighting * with * stalin . 
  the west would n't have stood a chance . 
  today on reddit there was a [ til ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2zpbxv/til_that_the_soviet_diplomat_molotov_was/ ) about how a soviet diplomat named molotov was the only person who ever shook hands with stalin , lenin , hitler , himmler , goering , roosevelt and churchill . 
  maybe what i 'm trying to say , is that what the us ( and the liberal west ) is afraid of , is that in 500 years , historians will look back on hitler 's betrayal of stalin and the resulting war between the two as only a ` speedbump ' on the way to a united germany-russia superpower . 
  my 2 cents . 
   it 's because we are working closely with the government in saudi arabia ( and iran ) in the fight against isis or other terrorist organisations ( we need saudi arabia and other powers in the middle east in this fight ) realpolitik 101 . 
  the saudis are n't us `` allies '' because we like their domestic policies . . 
  this is actually an interesting development for the road ahead . 
  i 've been back in the states a few months now , and i was talking to this girl at a bar/club around here , and i brought up copenhagen . 
  she said that its probably a nice place to visit , but she would n't want to live there . 
  i just laughed to myself . 
  on the flip side , before i got good at ` europe ' ( i.e. 
  comfortable ) , sometimes i would have the feeling that germans would see me only as a caricature of what they heard about the states . 
  you get all kinds , everywhere . 
  on both of those questions , i think they 're points to be made . 
  i 'm too tired at the moment , i 'll see if i can give it a go tomorrow . 
  ha , you have more patience than i do xd, 
   he said he actively hated hungarians we 're not all like that , he sounds like the kind of american-type i actively avoid when in europe ( in the states too ! ) . 
  rest assured he probably wo n't put together a visit anytime soon ;-),
