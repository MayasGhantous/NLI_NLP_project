   others , within the eu , hide behind this conspicuous obstacle because they are still skeptical of what they see as a u.s.-dominated nato . 
  that 's actually the politically-correct version ; what is actually more true , is that countries like france are more concerned with keeping turkey out of the eu and they are with a us-dominated nato , and this ` gridlock ' situation is a way for france to prove to other eu member states that turkey acts in such a way - i.e. 
  using leverage for its own political interests - that it should * never * be allowed in the eu . 
  not only france , either . 
  however , that is a point that is almost impossible to prove , and is politically-incorrect , so it usually never gets mentioned . 
  [ aww . . :( ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/d347e54f4221a1a1f57cdcd1d1047808/tumblr_mlt63iruph1rbh1pgo1_500.gif ), 
  yeah man , [ i 'm just a guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cs7j5i6aoc ), 
  so you think that i speak for the entire united states ? 
  wow , i 'm flattered, 
  for a little background , i wrote my master thesis on the ` turkey-eu-nato triangle ' and received the highest grade from a danish university . 
  in lieu of me writing out this and that , i 'll link an article on the matter : [ nato - eu cooperation - forget it !, 
  ] ( http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/?fa=53458 )  however this is one of the features of the eu not everyone has to participate in everything . 
  apart from the core issue that the eu deals with there is a degree of flexibility which allows countries to opt-out of different things . 
  everything that the military arm of the eu - the csdp - does , has to by eu law be agreed upon by all member states . 
  there are [ currently 5 ongoing eu military missions around the world ] ( http://www.eeas.europa.eu/csdp/missions-and-operations/ ) , and you 'd better believe that their rules of engagement are absolutely purely defensive . 
   you then mention nato and the use of nato infrastructure , unless something has changed i recall that nato decision making does not require unanimity so one country - turkey - could not adversely affect a decision in that respect . 
  thats not right mate . 
  turkey prevents cyprus ' involvement in nato , and the eu will not allow all member states except for one to be involved in discussions with , for example , nato , so cooperation is deadlocked . 
  turkey uses its membership in nato for leverage , and believes - with making some good points/some bad points - it has the right to do so . 
  not to be rude , but over and over , i see europeans talking about ` eu battlegroups ' and a ` unified european armed force ' . 
  it 's nonsense . 
  the eu is condemned to having 28 and maybe more countries agree to every single civilian and more importantly - military - mission . 
  that will never happen in anything but the most perfect of circumstances . 
  one reason being , you have to be crazy if you think that you 'll ever see highly trained heavily armed troops engaging in offensive combat operations with an eu patch on their shoulders . 
  another reason , is that it is not only virtually impossible for eu missions to borrow equipment/logistical support etc. 
  from nato after the failing of the berlin-plus agreement , since cyprus became a member of the eu and turkey is a member of nato ( and they veto each other ) , nato and the eu are n't even allowed to have an official meeting with one another . 
  for example , both nato and the eu ( csdp ) are engaging in anti-piracy operations today off the coast of somalia . 
  if they want to talk to one another to see what each other is doing - they have to actually pull their boats up next to each other , side by side , and talk face to face . 
  if anything , it is a highly controversial and highly unlikely situation that there will ever be something like a ` unified european armed force ' , ( also , because of the concept of sovereignty ) but people on / r/europe talk about it all the time as if it is a foregone conclusion . 
  why was france so hot on selling state of the art offensive military naval ships to putin 's russia in the first place ? 
  ok , you got me - i wrote a sentence a little differently than i should have one time on reddit . 
  can you give me a break ? 
  or a drastic reduction in us defense spending . . ( i 'll see myself out ), 
  i inadvertently hung out with a neonazi in kiel the other night . 
  it weirded me out so much , once i realized at the end of the night ( and that he was crazy ) , i just kind of want to leave . 
  do you want neonazis ? 
  because that 's how you get neonazis . 
  i do n't even know what 's happening . 
  you got a little mad though , i guess . 
  this is super weird .

  it 's easy to make a whataboutism comment re : sweden . 
  so you 're talking about [ ` social models ' , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_model ) and you both are trying to say that the scandinavians do n't engage in ` wage dumping ' or ` social dumping ' .

  one proposal is to establish statutory minimum wages at the national or the eu level . 
  however , trade unions in europe have very different views on this issue . 
  the scandinavian organizations are generally opposed to the idea , because they do not wish to have state intervention in the bargaining system . 
  in many other countries , trade unions are generally in favor of the proposal .

  or , rather , are you just using academic language to describe a thought that you had once with nothing to back it up whatsoever except your feels ? 
   that would not fly here in scandinavia . 
  not at all . 
  finland and sweden combined have roughly the same population as the state of illinois . 
  they are solid historical liberal democracies , meaning they have hundreds of years of history of liberalized economic policies . 
  they were also largely undamaged during ww2 .
