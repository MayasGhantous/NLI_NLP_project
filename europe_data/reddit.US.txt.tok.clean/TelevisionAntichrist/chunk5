  so ... about $ 3.50 ? 
  of what it may be , one thing its not is politically correct . 
  the 9/11 queef ( says so on my res so it must be true ) submits a new link to / r/europe . . 
  i 'd give you gold if i could . 
  its used differently . 
  for an example of a philosophy of what would be supported by roughly 25 % of the american voting public , here 's an [ interview of massachusetts senator elizabeth warren from last week 's real time with bill maher . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8i8hkn8slg&amp;feature=youtu.be ) i for one strongly support her , and i do n't feel like she 's ` anti-business ' . 
  ( though some on wall street would try to make that case ) sometimes europeans conflate ( what i think of when i think of ) the so-called ` average republican ' with what they call ` the average american ' . 
  at least 25 % of the voters in the us hold many/most of the same basic ideas/ideals of the average , say , german . 
  you think we like the nsa as-is ? 
  wall street ? 
  different levels of us regulation is one of the main issues that separates the average democrat and the average republican . 
  a large percentage of those democrats basically give full support to the philosophy of senator elizabeth warren , and i do n't see much difference from her position and that of the average european . 
  at times i think that the logic of the average european on economics could use a small pure dose of realism . 
  nobody would say that the whole of the european/eu economy is currently vibrant and dynamic . 
  ( though hopefully its headed back in that direction again ) while i support warren , i also fell in like with nobel prize winning economist paul krugman . 
  his nytimes blog [ the conscience of a liberal ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/ ) is 1a , one of the best sources which clarifies economic nuance as i 've ever found . 
  and i find his appraisals/critiques/praise of the european economic situation , and his appraisals/critiques/praise of the us economic situation all pretty accurate . 
  there may be real differences between warren 's position and krugman 's , but i 'm not aware of any . 
  we 're not all such cutthroat capitalists . 
  germans ? 
  any opinions ? 
   you can point to this one batallion with a sketchy image and membership and say `` look how much nazism there is in ukraine '' but let 's not forget fucking half the world 's neo-nazis are in fact russian living in russia . 
  if russia wants to fight nazi 's they should start within their own borders , since they are the biggest safe-haven for extreme right groups in the world . 
  true, 
   and eventually a federation it 's pretty likely that you wo n't be able to change anybody 's mind about the european union - they already made their mind up a long time ago . 
  this is because , there will always be tension between the existence of the eu and the notion of sovereignty . 
  just thinking out loud . 
  i just wonder generally why i never knew this . 
  ( i 've lived in germany for the last five years ) which universities in germany did ( some/most of ?? ), 
  the 9/11 hijackers attend ? 
  so what , because researchers have to feed their families , best way being to write a book that takes a year or so , that makes them fraudsters somehow ? 
  wtf ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  whatever he is , he 's a first class strategist . 
   the perpetrators of 9/11 were arab students , all of whom came to germany between 1992 and 1996 to study i had no idea . 
  so , when you heard that some of them were engineers etc. , does that mean that some of the 9/11 hijackers held degrees conferred by german universities ? 
  you  drank a lot of asshole . 
   it 's possible that taking the us one state at a time might be the most efficient route . 
  *  but really , we just need to deal with reality on these things . 
  huh ? 
   the 2 % is a gentleman 's agreement . 
  it is not a ` non-binding suggestion ' . 
  wow , this post went down like a lead balloon . 
  that was maybe a bad example . 
  i did n't mean to offend by using a personal anecdote . 
  my point was that the calculus of the security situation in europe would change with a disengaged us and a potentially nuclear-armed germany . 
  however , that was only one example of many which could have been given to illustrate my point . 
  i 'll use a different one next time . 
  ( for example , a possible greek over-reaction to turkish claims on greek islands or vice-versa ) but that was exactly what the guy i 'm talking about meant when he said  * nobody * wants germany to become a normal state . . germany would have to provide for its own security . . ( instead of being under the us nuclear umbrella ), 
  i was wondering then if european military integration could possibly mean military integration outside the bounds of the european union . 
  food for thought , anyway . 
  we just do n't know . 
  but knowing of some possibilities ( such as other european states possibly joining the uk-french military alliance ) makes it interesting to think about . 
   i 'm guessing that most people in other european countries would actually have less of a problem with a nuclear germany than we would ourselves i met this estonian girl in denmark once a few years back , and at one point in the night she turned to me and said ( as i had been living in germany for two years or so at that point ) `` i * hate * germany ! '', 
  and looked at me with such force of feeling . 
  i know that * she * would have a big problem with germany being possibly able to develop operable nukes in month or two . 
  i do n't know how many other people feel like her , or various shades of that opinion , ( from ` dislike ' to hers , aka ` hate ' ) but i do n't think it 's just her . 
   but as i said , i 'm pretty sure european militaries would integrate now here we 're getting interesting !, 
  this is one of the exact points that mearsheimer offers us to infer on our own from his information he gives . 
  ( another reason i find him fascinating ) what * would * happen with european military integration ? 
  would we start to see little alliances popping up within the eu , the alliances of which - like nato - is outside the * bounds * of the eu ? 
  for example , take a look at the [ lancaster house treaties ( 2010 ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_lancaster_house_treaties_ ( 2010 ) ( between france and the uk . 
  the relationship of this treaty to the european union defense policy is :  the treaty is bilateral between the uk and france and does not have a formal link with the european union 's common security and defence policy . 
  it does not use the separate lisbon treaty 's permanent structured cooperation facility , nor involve the european defence agency . 
  [ ( 2010 ) britain and france to share nuclear secrets as cameron and sarkozy sign historic 50-year military agreement ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1325863/britain-france-sign-historic-50-year-military-agreement.html ) could we possibly see , in such an eventuality as the us leaving european soil , of not only the uk-france military alliance becoming kind of active , but could we start seeing a few other european states joining it ? 
  if so , which ones ? 
  which ones not ? 
  would the ` nots ' start to think ` let 's make our own military alliance ' ? 
  what then ? 
  we do n't know . 
  and it 's precisely what [ brooks , ikenberry and wohlforth ( 2012 ) ] ( http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/is3703_brooks%20wohlforth%20ikenberry.pdf ) mean when they write :  ( p. 10 ) the united states ' globe girdling grand strategy is the devil we know , and retrenchment advocates effectively identify some of its risks and costs . 
  a world with a disengaged united states is the devil we do n't know , and we provide strong reasons why it would present much greater risks and costs . 
  retrenchment would in essence entail a massive experiment : how would the world work without an engaged , liberal leading power ? 
  international relations scholarship can not provide a certain answer . 
  what we can say is that . . 
  they argue for an engaged us on the global stage , while i side with ` restraint ' , ` retrenchment ' , ` offshore balancing ' . 
  i think mearsheimer would agree with me , when i say that ` the devil we do n't know ' wo n't be so bad , it does n't have to be * full * retrenchment , there are many shades worth taking a look at between ` deep engagement and retrenchment ' . 
  ( for background on us grand strategy debate , see [ ( 1997 ) ` come home america ' ] ( http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dpress/docs/press_come_home_america_is.pdf ) and compare with [ ( 2012 ) ` do n't come home america ' ] ( http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/is3703_brooks%20wohlforth%20ikenberry.pdf ) . 
  ( * international security quarterly ), 
   again , this where the eu comes in . 
  mearsheimer [ ( at 10:20 in the video ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbtj-gy_i3k#t=617 ) says that he considers russia to be physically located both ` in europe ' and ` in asia ' . 
  so , bear in mind , that he does not always mean the eu when he says ` europe ' . 
  this distinction can be sometimes confusing when first discovering mearsheimer , and during his speeches it always depends on context . 
  but , at least , he * does * mention a sort of clarifier during his speech at 10:20 . 
   as for conflicts with countries outside the eu , which would mean russia , well , us presence does n't seem to be a panacea to preventing economic and political conflicts , either . 
  when you write this , the first thought that pops into my head is [ ` the problem of conjecture ' . 
  ] ( http://books.google.de/books?id=gs-h80uc5jyc&amp;pg=pt347&amp;lpg=pt347&amp;dq=the+problem+of+conjecture+niall+ferguson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=euaqil3u97&amp;sig=hui1sqiaomu3a7cavfhakg7hiqs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ymsvvl-hfcvvaqeogugj&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20problem%20of%20conjecture%20niall%20ferguson&amp;f=false ) that is to say , we have no way of knowing what russia 's behavior would have otherwise been like had ` europe 's american pacifier ' been completely returned home . 
  of course , the balkans are also physically located in europe , ( not every country of which is in the eu , i.e. 
  serbia ) and i do n't think anyone will say that war there like the 90s is today unthinkable . 
  unlikely ? 
  sure . 
  but not unthinkable . 
  again , mearsheimer is not saying that the eu would necessarily begin to actually * have * problems , but that europe would suddenly have to go to great lengths in order to secure to the best of europe 's ability a state of bankable stability . 
  a europe in which war is unthinkable without tens of thousands of us troops would involve a massive effort on the part of europeans , europe , and the eu . 
  what that effort would be like , ( similar to the effort of full us retrenchment ) has not yet been described/thought of , as today it seems so unlikely it 's not yet worth the effort/prescient enough to study . 
  but you 'd probably see a lot of eu countries begin to pool their military capabilities pretty darn quick , and start to throw little chunks of sovereignty out the window to do so . 
  it 's those `` great lengths '' that i ( as written earlier ) associate in part with a theoretical systematic rolling back of the european welfare state system . 
  the thought experiment/counterfactual scenario goes like : what if germany re : nukes , were in japan 's position ? 
  that germany if it wanted to could have a nuclear weapon ready to go in a month or two .
