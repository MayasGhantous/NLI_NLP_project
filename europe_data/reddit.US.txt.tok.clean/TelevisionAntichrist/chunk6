  how would europe/different european states feel about that ? 
  also , mearsheimer uses * very * strong language to describe the behavior during its history towards canada and mexico . 
  he mentions that hitler admired the americans ( / europeans ) for how they/we approached the native american population . 
  he also clarifies at 6:10 that the reason that the capitol of canada is ottawa and not toronto is because ottawa is far enough north that it would have been a suicide mission for americans to try to take it militarily back in the day . 
  ** edit : ** mearsheimer is just as ` realist ' with europe , as he is with the united states - [ john mearsheimer on america unhinged . 
  ( january 2014 . 
  ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwqqzh59svo ) i would guess that most europeans would agree just about 100 % with his analysis of the united states in this speech and as `` unhinged '' . 
  whey he says peace , he does n't mean the opposite is just `` war '' . 
  he means many kids of competitions could possibly begin - for example , economic competition - that do not fit into the definition of `` peace '' . 
  it is not to say , however , that `` economic competition '' ( in its myriad of forms ) is equal to full-on war/warfare . 
  for example , mearsheimer [ does not believe that china can rise peacefully ] ( http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/can-china-rise-peacefully-10204 ) ; however , the worst case scenario of a conflict between the us and china , in his view , is quote `` only '' unquote * economic warfare . 
  * he never means that he thinks the us will engage directly in a ww2-style great power war with the chinese . 
  he means , the war will be economic in nature . 
  however , keep in mind that even though in the * almost * worst case scenario of economic warfare between china and the us , they would be spending huge amounts of money on military spending . 
  there 's a lot of possible scenarios , which could possibly take place , in the absence of what mearsheimer means when he says  peace . . and most of them certainly do n't include actual military warfare . 
  yeah , but there would be different issues at play , as well . 
  there would be the * whole * issue , of european states looking at one another , or one european state looking at a non-european state , ( i.e. 
  greece and turkey ) and possibly suddenly saying to themselves `` i 'm actually not 100 % sure about that state 's future intentions . 
  i 'd better make sure i 'm not a paper tiger . '', 
  slippery slope may ensue . 
  and it is that - in mearsheimer 's theory , that is [ the tragedy of great power politics ( 1992 ) . 
  ( updated edition published 2014 ) ] ( http://www.amazon.com/tragedy-great-politics-updated-edition/dp/0393349276 ), 
   apparently we 'd be at each other 's throats if uncle sam was n't watching over us . 
  or let me put it another way . 
  it is precisely because mearsheimer * does n't * believe that europe will suddenly be at each other 's throats , that he supports all us troops coming home . 
  what he is saying , is that without the us presence , security * competitions * might arise . 
  but he does n't think it would be anything europe could n't manage . 
  and - in the worse case scenario - if something * did * begin to pop off , as an ` offshore balancer ' , the us could be there in a week . 
   without which europe would inevitably descent into another large scale war that 's not what mearsheimer is saying . 
   or maybe it would sufficiently strengthen the case for a common eu military . 
  us retrenchment * absolutely * would . 
   in any case , claiming that the us presence is the reason why we 're not invading each other is silly . 
  see my first comment to you . 
  though , using a current example , us presence * is * the reason why russia is being so relatively careful in what it 's doing in ukraine . 
  ( see putin 's remarks about warsaw , using the words `` if '' and `` could '' rather delicately ), 
   apparently we 'd be at each other 's throats not exactly . 
  greece and turkey have a conflict , greece spends like 5 % gdp on defense , yet there is no ` hot war ' . 
  mearsheimer is n't saying there would be a ` hot war ' , ya 'll * actually * at each other 's throats . 
  he 's saying that , if you 're a state , you can never be certain of the intentions of other states . 
  and as the european pacifier , the us is artificially putting hierarchy into anarchy . 
  take that hierarchy away , and states suddenly have to totally provide for their own security . 
  there 's no dialing 911 in an anarchic system . 
  so , he 's saying that europe would have to start spending 2 % , 3 % , possibly more of gdp on security and defense were the us to retrench . 
   ( quoting myself ) so , mearsheimer 's position is really interesting . 
  i 'll see if i can explain it . 
   many europeans here on / r/europe say things like `` the us should go home '' , and `` the us should take all of its troops out of germany '' . 
  they think that is the right decision for europe . 
  what mearsheimer says , is that he agrees with those views , but that that would be the wrong decision for europe . 
   i agree with mearsheimer on the ` offshore balancer ' hypothesis , because he and i both think that europe ( and south korea ) are rich enough to provide for their own security . 
  if anything really bad happened , the us would be able to show up in full war-fighting force within a week or so . 
  however , the loss of the stability-producing us military could lead to ` flash points ' that are not big enough for full-scale us military presence , but are little conflicts around europe that would otherwise not happened . 
  conflicts europe will have to deal with itself . 
  not only little conflicts here and there , but europe would have to really start spending much , much more on defense than it does today . 
  ** the european welfare system would have to be * drastically * reduced - the us military leaving europe would almost be an end to the european-style welfare system as the west currently knows it . 
  ** europe would * have * to adopt a more american-style welfare state system . 
  ( speaking of those `` little conflicts '' , or ` flash-points ' that could possibly take place , it is precisely the increase in defense spending europe would have to incur with an offshore us military that would be meant to prevent those possible future conflicts before they start . 
  europe would have to * re * - enter the arena of international politics , great tragedies and all . ), 
   ( quoting myself ) that 's why i say that europeans who think the us military should ` come home ' are wrong ; they are arguing against their own self interests . 
  ( i.e. 
  guaranteed european stability ) i do n't necessarily share all of those interests , when compared with the amount american tax payers spend to provide this `` luxury '' , which is why i support us retrenchment . 
  with that said - i agree with mearsheimer , that europeans are * not * children . 
  that was kind of his joke . 
  i believe , as mearsheimer does , that europeans can handle their own security . 
  and it will be expensive for europe . 
  but , i would rather europe covered its own costs for defense and seurity , than for us taxpayers to cover the lion 's share of europe 's costs for security and defense . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : it is in europe 's best interests to have tens of thousands of us troops stationed on european soil . 
  ( at least over the next decade or two ) the question is - is it in america 's best interests ? 
  ** my conclusion ** : the us military leaving europe would almost be an end to the european-style welfare system as the west currently knows it . 
  ** disclaimer/edit ** : the opinion regarding the european welfare state , and its possible future , is mine alone . 
  mearsheimer does not mention the european welfare state during this talk . 
  i inferred this conclusion , based on my ` gut feeling ' of how europe would theoretically have to start spending 2 % , 3 % , 4 % , 5 % , etc. 
  gdp on defense , if the us ever did/actually does ever get up and leave europe . 
  personally , i have no problem if european states have to start spending 2 % or 3 % gdp on security and defense . 
  whatever consequences arrive , i.e. 
  the slashing of welfare benefits eu-wide/europe-wide , does n't concern me . 
  furthermore , it is precisely that i do * not * believe small wars will suddenly break out in europe with the us gone , that i support mearsheimer 's position . 
  sometimes during a speech , mearsheimer will switch from scientific/descriptive language , to a more conversational style . 
  that 's one of the things i like about him - his clarity . 
  i get a few things from the line . 
  first , mearsheimer believes that all us troops should be removed from germany/europe and from south korea . 
  * when he says that the us is treating its european allies like children , he is giving in part a certain support to the feelings/belief held by many europeans today that they are being treated like children by the us . 
  like they are being treated like countries who ca n't control themselves and ca n't defend themselves . 
  this is how a lot of europeans feel , when they say they want the us to [ ` come home ' ] ( http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dpress/docs/press_come_home_america_is.pdf ) and that 's how [ many americans ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/05/opinion/come-home-america.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) feel as well , who believe the us should retrench . 
  so mearsheimer is giving legitimacy to those feelings that are held by many europeans with that line . 
  what mearsheimer is * also * doing with that line , is he is directly attacking the amount of money in the us defense budget that is directly used for the stationing of 40,000 us military personnel in germany and 50,000 personnel in south korea . 
  those costs are [ astronomical ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/report-us-footing-greater-bill-overseas-bases ) . 
  he is saying , basically , that all of the money spent - those * huge * amounts - to keep troops stationed in those two areas of the world ( the cost differential between ` deep engagement ' and ` offshore balancing ' ) is * totally * a waste . 
  it 's a waste , because the same or very * very * similar levels - in his opinion - of global stability could be achieved by simply ` offshore balancing ' , instead of what we are doing right now , which is known as [ ` deep engagement ' ] ( http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/22595/dont_come_home_america.html ) by supporters and * ` sticking your nose where it does n't belong ' * by [ detractors ] ( http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/23545/correspondence.html?breadcrumb=%2fpublication%2f22595%2fdont_come_home_america ) . 
  so , mearsheimer 's position is really interesting . 
  i 'll see if i can explain it . 
  many europeans here on / r/europe say things like `` the us should go home '' , and `` the us should take all of its troops out of germany '' . 
  they think that is the right decision for europe . 
  what mearsheimer says , is that he agrees with those views , but that that would be the * wrong * decision for europe . 
  i agree with mearsheimer on the ` offshore balancer ' hypothesis , because he and i both think that europe ( and south korea ) are rich enough to provide for their own security . 
  if anything really bad happened , the us would be able to show up in full war-fighting force within a week or so . 
  however , the loss of the stability-producing us military could lead to ` flash points ' that are not big enough for full-scale us military presence , but are little conflicts around europe that would otherwise not happened . 
  that 's why i say that europeans who think the us military should ` come home ' are wrong ; they are arguing against their own self interests . 
  i do n't necessarily share all of those interests , which is why i support us retrenchment . 
  part of the reason i am writing all this stuff out , including me figuring out my * own * opinions , is to inform other americans that all that money supporting troops in germany and south korea is * wasted * . 
  __________________________ * i am not precisely sure if he means the us should completely give the [ kaiserslauten military community ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaiserslautern_military_community ) ( which includes [ ramstein ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ramstein_air_base ) to germany/europe , and the us military would only be ` on site ' at the kmc while wearing a nato cap ... or , if he means that the us military would leave 100 or so us military cap-wearing administrators ( for example , at [ landstuhl regional medical center ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/landstuhl_regional_medical_center ) , or what .
