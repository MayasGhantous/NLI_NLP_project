  - abraham lincoln, 
  europe : not enough guns for all :(, 
  [ thanks russia !, 
  ( from 20:31 on ) `` now we come to an issue of great importance . 
  why should you care ? 
  there are many countries around the world that should be happy if the us is n't active in their region , because , you know , when the united states is in your region of the world , in some cases , you know , its like sleeping with an elephant - there 's always the danger that the elephant will roll over and crush you . 
  it 's not always such a good thing to have the united states in your back yard . 
  but that 's not true in the case of europe . 
  when the cold war ended , there were a number of people who thought the americans would leave europe , and come home . 
  but we did not . 
  we stayed here . 
  and as i 'm sure many of you have noticed , no european leader has asked the americans to go home . 
  not a single case of a european leader asking the americans to go home . 
  and in fact , the europeans are happy with the fact that the americans are in europe , the united states military . 
  why is that the case ? 
  it 's very simple . 
  because the united states acts as a pacifier . 
  you know what happened yesterday in stockholm . 
  the eu was awarded the nobel peace prize for facilitating , or keeping , the peace in europe ? 
  this was a giant mistake . 
  that award should not have been given to the eu - that award should have been given to nato . 
  the reason that you have peace in europe , is because the american military is physically located in europe , and we maintain the peace . 
  that 's why we stayed here after the cold war , and that 's why nobody is asking us to leave . 
  it 's * not * the european union . 
  we 'd go home if it was the european union . 
  why would we spend all this money defending europe if war had been burned out of europe ? 
  it makes absolutely no sense . 
  we 're here for one very good reason . 
  we are the pacifier . 
  and the heart and soul of the problem is germany . 
  you understand that if we go , the germans have to provide for their own security . 
  the germans have no nuclear weapons , they 're physically located in the center of europe - they would become a normal state . 
  * nobody * wants germany to become a normal state . 
  they want the united states of america to put its security umbrella - or more specifically , its * nuclear * umbrella - over germany . 
  the whole purpose of expanding nato eastward was to create a giant zone of peace in europe . 
  that 's why the americans want to incorporate countries like ukraine and georgia into nato . 
  they want to make it impossible for the russians to cause any trouble , anywhere . 
  it 's the american pacifier . 
  the question you want to ask yourself , is what happens if the american pacifier disappears ? 
  what happens if the americans leave because they have to go to asia to deal with this growing chinese threat ? 
  then germany will have to provide for its own security , and the eu - if you believe that the eu had been one of the premisable ( ? ), 
  causes of peace - things are not looking too good on that front by the way . 
  the eu appears to be in quite bad shape to me . 
  if anything , its problems are * stoking * nationalism in europe , not promoting internationalism . 
  so at a time when the eu is in trouble , and nato may be in trouble - given the analysis i 'm presenting here - it 's not good for europe . 
  ** so what does this all mean for how europeans think about international politics ? 
  ** i think it has three broad implications . 
  first of all , you should hope that china does * not * continue to rise , economically and therefore militarily . 
  you should hope that china 's rise stops ; that the chinese economy either flatlines , or grows very slowly in the future , and that the china threat never materializes . 
  second , you should hope that america retains its imperial impulse . 
  this deep-seated belief that you find inside the beltway that we have a right and a responsibility to run the world . 
  i do n't like it at all , but most americans do . 
  it 's in your interest to see that continue , because that way the americans will be compelled to keep forces in europe , and to treat you like little children who ca n't be trusted , should the united states go away - and that way , the american pacifier will remain intact . 
  and finally , you should hope that the american economy continues to flourish , so we have the wealth to generate the military forces that can * stay * here in europe and act as a pacifier . 
  all this is a way of saying , in conclusion , that europeans have a deep-seated interest , for the purposes of maintaining peace , in keeping the trans-atlantic relationship that now exists - alive and well . 
  thank you . '',

  well , you 're still keeping hope alive for the original language/english translation thing on / r/europe , innit ? 
  probably 4 or 5 years old , which for whatever reason was n't stated by op . 
   the 46 % of americans who disagreed probably thought their people were perfect . 
  ( with ya 's jokie joke ) there was only a 2 % difference in germans and americans who agreed with this statement . 
   the sheer volume of these stories is sickening / u/somebodyreasonable probably also uses the word ` sickening ' to describe isis stoning women . 
  so either sending kids to bible camp in the us and isis cutting off heads is somehow both comparable on some level , or this guy is using language incorrectly . 
  which one is it ? 
  i do n't get it . 
   a crusty old family of inbred germans to be fair , prince harry comes from a completely ` fresh ' bloodline , 
  aka it 's all uncle sam 's fault !, 
   but im not saying it is completely wrong i 'm just curious , it seems as though your statement is lacking the part that starts : however . . 
  i 'm not sure what your opinion on the matter is . 
  you start off by saying , basically , * somewhat right * and * somewhat wrong * , in attaching certain post-war decisions on school curriculum to ` americans ' . 
  first , you only listed the * somewhat right * parts , and i do n't know what you * do n't * like . 
  furthermore , i 'm not at all sure about what you 're implying - what , that if it was n't for the post-ww2 're - education ' curriculum , certainly at least approved by the us ( the uk has lost its power by now ) , that germans would n't have a guilt-complex about ww2 ? 
  or , to a lesser degree ? 
  or what ? 
   damned if we do , damned if we do n't . 
  you just described the position the united states is in whenever any crisis in the world arrives . 
  ( not including humanitarian aid efforts on the part of the us navy - everyone hates the us military , until there 's an environmental catastrophe ), 
  thx !, 
  translation please ? 
  europeans sometimes talk about iraq , as though either 1 . we 've never heard about it , or 2 . were n't just as against it as they were . 
  i would say that * at least * a third of american adults were at least as against the iraq war as most of germany was . 
  and 1/3 of us adults is larger than the entire adult population of germany . 
  yet , europeans/germans sometimes include that 1/3 in their descriptions of ` warmongering ' or ` jingoistic ' quote `` americans '' unquote . 
  i have also never heard a european say the specific phrase ` global public goods ' . 
  they do n't know what they are , and that they are direct recipients of those ` global public goods ' , and that such gpgs are provided directly by the us military . 
  since they do n't know that , they do n't understand how the providing of those gpgs undergirds the international system , and keeps global stability at a relative low level . 
  furthermore , they do n't quite seem to get , sometimes , how nato is a very important piece of the puzzle , and as such , they can say things ( with a straight face ) like / u/pestibecsi : [ i think it would be high time to disband the nato . 
  what is even the point ? 
  it was made to stop the spread of communism , and communism is practically dead and not spreading .
