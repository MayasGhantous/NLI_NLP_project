  as far as i can see iraq ended the nato in spirit just not on paper yet .

  can you provide a translation ? 
   btw iirc . 
  the whole german guilt complex teaching in school was started thanks to americans ... [ forced burial of death march and concentration camp victims by german civilians ; dp camp ] ( http://www.ushmm.org/online/film/display/detail.php?file_num=5529 ), 
   so basically you are a nazi without the power to implement your plans . 
  duly noted . 
  *  sometimes , i wonder if us-flavored ~ ~ jingoism ~ ~ sarcasm literally kills most of an infected brain . 
   in no way has the eu or its predecessors - which we did not join but found alongside others - required , explicitly or *** implicitly *** , military involvment by any member state . 
  eu treaty of lisbon , [ mutual defense clause ] ( http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/mutual_defence_en.htm ), 
  thanks for this link . 
  i think he 's great . 
  however , europeans do n't seem to like mearsheimer much on the whole . 
  he 's a famous theoretical offensive neorealist . 
  as such , he argues against the vivacity of liberalism as a theory - and it is in that theory that europe more sees the world through . 
  here 's an excellent talk of his , [ ` the honorary patronage of john mearsheimer : the future of the trans-atlantic alliance ' ( 11 dec , 2012 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbtj-gy_i3k ) trinity college dublin , speech held before world 's oldest debating society , ( 325 years old ) in becoming an honorary patron of the trinity philosophical society . 
  the video referenced in the article ( available [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smrf8r7ug6s#t=410 ) ) ended , with a sketch of a german guy giving the state of the union address auf deutsch . 
  ( in place of the president ) he ends the speech by saying , in english , `` so long , motherfuckers ! '' . 
  the camera then pans to the real footage of michelle obama blowing kisses . 
  roger . 
  i 'm just wondering why / u/dclauzel would write his/her remark using the words `` j\u2019 aime beaucoup '' . 
  any other quotes you like a lot from isis there / u/dclauzel ? 
  or one of these : https://i.imgur.com/xdybgqu.jpg xd, 
  you 're both sort of right - nato * does * streamline military cooperation between members , and russia being a single country * does * make a relatively significant difference , * inter alia * . 
  it 's also an interesting point / u/maefuckingeri made about military salaries in comparison . 
  see bro , i think that germany is now at the point where - the west trusts you . 
  * we * trust you . 
  there 's no fear on our side , the uncertainty of taking steps on the world stage , is more in your guys ' court . 
  i mean , take a look at the following video , from afghanistan , where the german government awarded american soldiers a very high german award : [ u.s. 
  soldiers awarded german gold cross medal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nawt73a600 ) i know that it sucks to still have the stigma from nazis and what not , but , taking the above video as context , maybe starting to really help the people of the world will really be that which finally convinces everybody everywhere that these nazi comparisons are just wrong . 
  i do n't mean that germany should start to really take responsibility on the world stage alongside the us * just to * start to deal with the whole ` nazi ' thing - the point is to help people who need it ... but it may be a nice ` side effect ' , if you will . 
   in my opinion this was the result of the unprecedented peaceful revolution that happened in the gdr at that time . 
  i 'm sure that factor deserves more recognition , everything else being equal . 
  yeah , sometimes i post things which is actually a cute short-hand for what i mean , and i can really see how that would be misinterpreted , because how are others supposed to know where i 'm coming from ? 
  i try to not do that here , but that comment of mine is an example of my ` personal short-hand ' . 
  i should 've been more descriptive there i reckon . 
  i could n't be more against the republicans if i tried - i even moved to a foreign country - in part - to get away from having to hear that fox news bullshit . 
  ok , so this will be my last comment , as i 've like taken over this whole thread . 
  but you leave out an important dimension , when you write :  the only responsibility we have , is making sure that europe 's interest are protected and that we continue to grow strong . 
  the only responsibility we have , is making sure that europe 's interest are protected and that we continue to grow strong . 
  you are leaving out the dimension , that according to western values and morals , we as westerners refuse to live in a world in which people needlessly suffer . 
  the tsunami in the philippines is an example . 
  i do n't want to get into the isis thing right now , that 's a whole other topic . 
  but in the philippines , it was the us navy that was there - same with japan . 
  ( and the us sailors who died from radiation poisoning trying to help japan ) one of my points , is that we have to work together , and show each other that we are acting according to the best of our ability . 
  and it is certainly not just the eu that is deficient on that score . 
  and that , there is a lot of work yet to be done , and when i see posts that i interpret as coming from the position that there is n't , that 's where i have a problem . 
  it is n't even a matter of world-wide influence . . what is `` influence '' , anyway ? 
  if it means that i 'd rather watch liam neeson do some kicks to some guy holding his daughter hostage than a bollywood flick , then yeah - but the topic of `` influence '' is a whole other can of worms , and though i do n't want to get into it , i think it 's a ` keyword ' used to imply things i do n't agree with . 
   not to be petty , but what about that debt mountain ? 
  there are a lot of common misconceptions about us debt . 
  for example , as a percentage of gdp , the us debt can be relatively compared with the debt of belgium . 
  about the rest of your comment , there 's nothing that i really disagree with . 
  i guess , what i mean , is that i would like to see more european politicians , having honest conversations with their constituents about the issue . 
  i saw this [ a little bit ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140619/defreg01/306190036/minister-german-defense-budget-will-rise ) with germany 's new minister of defense von der leyen - and i was very impressed !, 
  she was talking about the general topic of taking responsibility , that which i 'm talking about . 
  this is , in my opinion , the right general direction . 
  i understand that tomorrow europe ca n't turn around and suddenly spend 2 % gdp on defense . 
  but what i mean , is that i want to see some realism injected into the inter-european debate . 
  in my opinion , even the very existence of this article itself , is a step in the right direction . 
  be thankful the topic is n't gypsies . 
  i even treated you with respect * after * i saw that you wrote this ;-), 
   why the fuck should a permanent seat be tied to military prowess ? 
  i was referring to the realist notion , that a permanent seat in the unsc is * necessarily * tied to military prowess . 
  because , that is the very nature of why the unsc exists . 
  if it functions the way it was meant to is maybe another issue . 
  another few euros hans , and we 'll have skulls - on our * caps *, 
   and people wonder why american politics is a broken system . 
  is it ? 
  i know that somalia is a failed state , and that as such , it is a broken system , but i think the us is actually doing pretty alright , $ 15 trillion annual gdp and all . . 
  but my point revolves around the concept of ` free-riding ' . 
  free-riding , can not in itself , be a long term policy . 
  the point is , to do that which you must , which gets you out of the area of ` free-riding ' , and into the area of ` taking responsibility ' . 
  that 's my only point here , in essence . 
  ** edit : ** i would n't vote for some politician who 's crazy . . that was a bit of an overstatement on my part . 
  my point , rests on the neo-realist assumption , that one state can * never * be sure about the intentions of other states . 
  that 's one reason why neorealism is n't popular in europe , because the eu was invented precisely to ` do-away with war ' , which incorporates the assumption that european nations * can * be certain of the intentions of other eu member states . 
  but i 'm talking about the us , which obviously is n't in the eu . 
  european union member states can , i say , * never * be sure about the intentions of the us . 
  what if we elect someone like rand paul , who 's more isolationist than any other us politician ? 
  if article v ever sees some chinks in its armour , you should believe that - very fast - other nations will start to see how they can take advantage . 
  which is why it would behoove europe to start planning for that possibility before the fact , a kind of insurance . 
  it would take years and years for the eu to spend enough on defense , the pooling of defense resources and the like , to secure its own defense and security with the us not being a player . 
  i do n't think that europe can always assume the us will be there `` in the blink of an eye '' after thirty years or so . 
  who knows what can change ? 
  all i know is that , right now , i only support the us going to europe 's defense in the most dire of circumstances , i.e. 
  a war like world war 2 . 
  anything less , and i think ` let them deal with it themselves ' . 
  that 's why i support the us * not * sending weapons to ukraine . 
  it 's a european problem , so if europe wants to send weapons to ukraine , they can do it themselves . 
  and i assure you , from my research , in the next ten or fifteen years or so , many - if not the majority - of americans , will feel that way . 
  europeans do n't realize all the time , that when they say ` world police ' , they also mean the us defending europe . 
   europe is powerful enough to defeat all upcoming superpowers and the current one is pretty much our bitch really ? 
  you think the us is europe 's `` bitch '' ? 
   sorry i do n't really follow , according to you why would europe spend more on defense if the current superpower ( the us ) is in our pocket . 
  it has to do with responsibility , but it also has to do with being uncertain about the future intentions of europe . 
  the current wisdom in europe is that the us will * always * allow the europeans to free-ride , but i 'm not sure if this is the case . 
  already , in the last few years , i have heard very many americans say , in exasperated tone , how they can not believe the american taxpayer is subsidizing most of the security and defense of europe . 
  ( and south korea , for that matter ) another decade of that exasperation , and who knows ?
