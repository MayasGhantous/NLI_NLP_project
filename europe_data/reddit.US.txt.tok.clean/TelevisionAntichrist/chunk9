  all i know is , that if a politician running for potus said they would substantially reduce troops in europe , as well as the us 's guarantees to nato , i would probably vote for them - regardless of their other politics . 
  many , many other americans feel the same way . 
  so , it is in the best interest , of europe to really start investing in this area , in my opinion . 
  ok . first , that answer was sarcastic . 
  ( when i said the us had nothing to do with the fall of the soviet union ) that 's where my apology partially came from . 
  ( i notice sometimes on / r/europe people do n't pick up on my sarcasm and think i 'm * gulp * serious ) as far as i know , the us was * the * driving force , which caused the soviet union to collapse . 
  the us was * the * force , keeping russia out of the rest of germany . 
  so , in answer to your question , i would say * absolutely * the us - in essence - kicked the russians out of eastern germany . 
  done , however , not in the style of ww2 , but through the `` cold war '' . 
  the soviet union was spending an ` enourmous ' amount of its gdp on competing with the us , and that plus many other factors led directly to its downfall and countries like eastern germany and bulgaria and the rest of the soviet bloc dissolving and the russians ` going home ' . 
  you talk about the us as though the us is a separate * civilization * than europe . 
  we are variations of the same civilization . 
  but then again , as i said earlier , i can tell that you and i wo n't get very far here . 
  and i 'm not too concerned with the opinion of volker pispers , at any rate . 
  not only does it have to do with responsibility , it has to do with the realist position , of ` never being able to be certain of the intentions of other states . ', 
  what if rand paul gets elected ? 
  he will slash defense spending . 
  i 'm not saying that will happen in 2016 , but who knows what will happen further down the road . 
  it 's best to be prepared . 
  but my main argument , has to do with responsibility . 
  how wonderful would it have been , for example , had europe been able to fully deal with the tsunami in the philippines , with the us navy fully disengaged ? 
  that would have been something , would n't it have been ? 
  i 'm just saying , the concept of ` free-riding ' has a lot of shades , but not many of them relate so closely with the concept of ` responsibility ' . 
  in short , the us is treating germany like a little child , and germany allows itself to be treated as such . 
  than germans become aware they are being treated as such , and lash out . 
  if germans wanted to take more responsibility , the us would ever-more treat germany more as a peer , and there would be less and less for germans to be indignant about vis-a-vis the us , and then we could go towards germany becoming a ` normal nation ' again . 
  certainly , today , with 50,000 foreign troops on its soil , germany is far from being a ` normal ' nation . 
  that 's where a lot of the animosity towards the us from germany begins . 
  and its that ` feeling ' that i want to get rid of . 
  also , if germany * were * a quote `` normal country '' , you do n't think germany would have nukes and a few aircraft carriers by now ? 
  for the sake of irish whiskey , the eu even declared a few years ago that one of its goals was to have an aircraft carrier in the name of the eu . 
  no , ha :d it was more me pointing out to a curious truth . 
  and i see you 're from s-h , so i wanted to point it out . 
  i mean , you have n't said anything * remotely * close to fighting words , i do n't even know where you get that idea from !, 
  it has to do with clarifying the entire situation for the people living in that country , so that they may better support those policies worth supporting and vice versa . 
  for example , for a justification of us grand strategy and defence spending as it is today - with full explanation , see : [ stephen g. brooks , g. john ikenberry , and william c. wohlforth . 
  `` do n't come home , america : the case against retrenchment . '', 
  international security 37 , no . 
  3 ( winter 2012/13 ) : 7 -- 51 . 
  ] ( http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/22595/dont_come_home_america.html ) the above article is a ( 2012 ) answer to the article ` come home , america ' ( 1997 ) . 
  it was only after comparing the two , that i realized i sided more with the 1997 article than the 2012 article , but * at least * the 2012 article spells out - fully - the entirety of us grand strategy and , for example , why the us spends as much as it does on defense . 
  i was asking , basically , for a version of this debate for germany , but - actually , i think such papers actually do n't exist . 
  which is a real shame , and , by the way , a big disservice to germans and europeans . 
  i 've lived in germany for the last five years , and this topic is close to that which i have researched for university the last three or so years . 
  suddenly , for example nato , is a hot topic . 
  after i read for the last two or three years in european circles that the common wisdom is that nato is useless , for example . 
  it is n't a matter of * pissing * someone off , if what you say is basically true - or , benefit of the doubt being what it is , more true than untrue . 
  if i happen to make people upset , by stating things that are basically true , than it is precisely that reaction i do n't care about . 
  because , should you refrain from saying those things you believe to be true because you know some people wo n't like to hear it ? 
  i want something written by a person . 
  not a government . 
  that 's because , i want justification - given by an independent source . 
  the point being , if the current levels of spending actually * are n't * justifiable , nobody will independently try to justify them , because they would have to put their name on the paper and stand by it . 
  if you ca n't find any independent researcher that fully justifies the current levels of german defense spending , than that should tell you a * lot * - mostly , that it actually * is n't * justifiable . 
  which , by the way , would n't have anything to do with whether it is * realistic * . 
  sorry if i stepped over some bounds , that was n't my intention . 
  i just do n't know what you 're inferring , so i assume things that i think you may be inferring - which you feel you are not . 
  the end of the cold war was probably before you were born , but i do n't know how you can reject that a few hundred kilometers away from where you were born , a few years before you were born , there were soviet/russian soldiers stationed . 
  is it really so controversial these days to say the cold war consisted of the us and the soviet union ? 
  maybe germany kicked out the russians themselves , like the french did with the germans ? 
   just like in the old days the men wielding the swords tended to have the most enviable positions . 
  the name for this position , today , is * exorbitant privilege * , referring to the us . 
  ( * inter alia * ) it 's a good strategy for the europeans too ( to ` free-ride ' ) - were i them , i would probably think the same way !, 
  ok , i 'm sorry , the us had nothing to do with the collapse of the soviet union  . <, 
  first of all , i live in your bundesland , have for five years . 
  second of all , you are really responding aggressively . 
  as such , i 'm done with you , because we 'll never get anywhere . 
  you probably are writing this from right down the street from me , anyway , which adds to things that are true that you do n't want to necessarily look at from a neutral perspective . 
  you gave me the ` white paper ' ( fucking wikipedia ) of the german government . 
  i 'm looking for a source , written by an individual , a researcher . 
  i 'm looking for an academic journal article . 
  also , the farthest back i could find official prussian doctrine was 1870 . 
  do you think the us army may have needed ` doctrine ' before that , for example , during the civil war ? 
  or , are you just confused ? 
   and not only do we not need the us for our own catastrophe relief i would say that kicking out the russians from half of germany , where they had been for decades and essentially ruled , was quite a form of catastrophe relief , oder ? 
   people like you have to be managed . 
  what 's your problem ? 
   we understand us doctrine very well . 
  we fucking invented it . 
  see , its rude for me to tell you , that you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  i do n't want to be rude . 
  how about , instead of this , can you provide me with a source , that justifies europe 's current military spending ? 
  i can provide you with * many * sources that justify current us military spending - or , on the other side , sources which argue for an annual defense spending of $ 400 billion or so , instead of the $ 600 million or so level we see today . 
  can you give me a source that * justifies * germany 's ( and for that matter , europe 's ) current levels of defense spending ? 
  otherwise , we 're just going back and forth on minor points of the overall ` issue ' , and its a waste of time . 
  an example of what i mean ( i.e. 
  an argument that u.s. defense spending could be reduced by roughly a 1/3 ) , can be seen here : [ gholz , e. , et . 
  ( 1997 ) come home america : a strategy of restraint in the face of temptation , * international security * , vol . 
  ] ( http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dpress/docs/press_come_home_america_is.pdf ) ** edit : ** much of the argument that us defense spending can be reduced by as much of a 1/3 , includes the assumption that europe is very rich , and is beyond capable of handling its own security . 
  i agree whole heartedly . 
  ** edit 2 : ** * europe * did n't so much * invent * the general us grand strategy , as the dutch did in the 1600 's , and the british did after that . 
   so ... what is this threat that europe ca n't deal with ? 
  first things first , a lot of the time the building up of military power - has nothing to do with ` wars ' . 
  it has to do with ` helping people ' . 
  take the typhoon in the philippines for example , where germany was largely ineffective . 
  ( and held up by a single base guard - think that would happen with the us ? ), 
  from a der spiegel article entitled [ ` unprepared : government failings intensify haiyan aid disaster ' ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/government-failings-intensify-haiyan-aid-disaster-in-philippines-a-934288.html )  as difficult as it is at the moment , the consul has to keep his cool . 
  his cellphone rings , but he does n't answer . 
  according to seidenschwarz , answering a call while in conversation with someone is a serious faux pas . 
   `` please understand my problem , '' he says pleasantly to the guard .
