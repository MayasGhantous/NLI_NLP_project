/ r/celticunion is leaking . 
  quit trying to dash my dreams of / r/celticunion !, 
  i actually think of it from [ many of the same angles ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pr29w/push_hard_for_united_states_of_europe_now/d4ncsth?context=3 ) as you . 
  and i agree the us is more of a unitary state these days . 
  i had n't considered about nato . 
  it 's entirely possible that by fulfilling the need for common defense , nato hindered europe 's development of a united identity . 
  the crux of my original post was that i simply do n't understand how the whole multi-speed europe thing is supposed to work . 
  the different deals among different groups just leaves the whole thing too vulnerable to being torn apart , imo . 
  american here . 
  having spent a reasonably large chunk of the past week trying to figure out what is going over there , i find myself increasingly amazed and grateful that america sorted this federalism stuff long before i was born . 
  from what i can tell , only 17 of the 28 eu countries seem to be completely committed to this whole united europe thing and you have * dozens * of other countries that have wormed their way in to some of the benefits of the union without also committing to the parts they do n't like . 
  from this , the conclusion i 've come to is that [ i have no idea how you folks thought this was going to work . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/supranational_european_bodies-en.svg/640px-supranational_european_bodies-en.svg.png ) i hope brexit has n't ruined the whole thing and i wish you luck . 
  i do n't either . 
  america gets made fun of for its nationalism , but it 's half a continent of incredibly diverse peoples working together . 
  europe has never come close to that sense of unity . 
  the eu has really been a half-assed attempt at federalism the whole time . 
  allowing certain nations to have their own currency , closed borders , trade deals , etc is never going to work . 
  fundamental stuff like that has to be applied evenly among members and to the exclusion of non-members . 
  did n't churchill coin the term ? 
  to be fair , it took the us a while to figure this one out , too . 
  it 's the 17th amendment i believe . 
  statistics !, 
  this is one of the most british things i 've read . 
  lol it sounds like you have a lot of delicate situations on the horizon, 
  pretty much . 
  though more accurately the texas leaving the us thing is coming later , when scotland leaves the uk over this . 
  why not northern ireland ? 
  i read something about sinn fein saying just that . 
  [ hearing `` this is fine '' on bbc . 
  so scotland is going to leave the uk to join eu , right ? 
  will northern ireland leave as well ? 
  can wales leave ? 
  any chance of uk being whittled down to just england ? 
  dear dad , everything is going to be okay . 
  we still love you . 
  please ignore the fireworks in a couple of weeks , that 's about us , not you . 
  love , america, 
  america loves a brit these days . 
  have you considered hollywood ? 
  bbc called it for leave . 
  holy shit . 
  as a western american , it 's not even time for bed yet . 
  i may stay up for some speeches . 
  i got ta say this is interesting . 
  it must be like this when europe gets to watch our election results at non-godawful hours . 
  we 'd have to make them at least 2 states , probably more like 4 . 
  got ta be iceland , right ? 
  i feel like iceland is just happy to get visitors or be noticed . 
  a history professor for a president seems pretty friendly . 
  well i would n't put american before human , silly !, 
  idk . 
  maybe i 'm just reacting to the sas brigading . 
  i think i may have to give up on european subs in general . 
  sorry if it rubbed you the wrong way , it was a joke . 
  this is correct . 
  [ what he said . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/50w64f/how_would_you_rank_europeeu_your_country_or/d77vjn3 ), 
  i do n't know . 
  would you be willing to accept that as an answer ? 
  i understand you 've had more short-tempered americans try to shove it down your throat with poorly-worded arguments before and i 'm trying not to be one of them . 
  i 'm trying to arrive at a better way and gaining insight from the european perspective to aid me in doing that is why i made this post , but the truth is i 'm just not there yet . 
  at the moment it 's a bit of an [ i know it when i see it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i_know_it_when_i_see_it ) kind of thing . 
  i do n't know if it 's something i * can * explain , if i 'm even right about it . 
  jeez , why is everyone so damned hostile when i check back in these threads the next day ? 
  so you 're saying [ if kitt were real ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knight_rider_\\ ( 1982_tv_series \\ ) ) that 's honestly a bit of a toss up . 
  i 'd have to meet several sapient american cars to form an opinion on them , but it 's actually quite possible . 
  i 've seen a lot of wackjobs in arizona . 
  you know , you bigots are n't as adorable as you 've been led to believe . 
  well my grandfather spoke five languages , one of which was polish , so i guess he counts . 
  i can speak like two and a half , but none are polish . 
  i 've really never met a polish-american who identified as anything more than their ancestry , unless they were immigrants . 
  but you 're probably meeting young idiots with something to prove . 
  you would identify with a socialist ai program more than humanity ? 
  i feel more different from the uk than i do australians . 
  culturally they feel only a bit more different than canadians , but in different ways . 
  like , if you mashed southern california , texas , and florida together in the ocean , that 's what australia feels like to me . 
  i think of canada the same as all the northern border states , except the northern provinces , which i view the same way i do alaska . 
  except quebec . 
  i do n't know what the hell is going on there . 
   there is no 3 . 
  got it . 
  you are the hitler of ai . 
  the reason i asked this question is that i had a hunch that it was a * huge * difference from the american perspective . 
  if we all met up in antarctica and were asked `` what are you ? '', 
  i would answer american , you would answer bavarian , uk folks would probably answer british or scottish , and most would answer the demonym of their country . 
  the thing i do n't know if europeans grasp is how different us identifying as american first is from a european person putting their country first . 
  it 's more like putting the eu at the top of the list , to us . 
  while you may see the uk as ( for the time being ) `` technically part of us , but they do n't act like they 're in the eu '' , we see canada as `` they act just like us , but technically not part of the us . '', 
  i think i 'll edit the post to put my list in . 
  the place exists entirely as a hate factory that breaks its own rules about downvoting linked comments . 
  today they hit a couple of people in / r/comicbooks with -75 karma on their comments . 
  frelling * comic books . 
  * hell , they are probably why this question was downvoted . 
  i wish it were condemned more . 
  the united states was the reigning olympic rugby champion until mere days ago , when fiji beat you and we fell one olympic games short of being the * century-long * champion . 
  [ we have twice as many gold medals than anyone else !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rugby_union_at_the_summer_olympics#results ) how dare you mock our teams in a sport we are obviously great at and care about !, 
  no i meant europe/commonwealth/anglosphere .
