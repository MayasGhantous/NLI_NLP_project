  whoa . 
   usa feels quite foreign . 
  we speak the same language as the usa but the culture and politics are quite different , whereas a country on the other side of europe might speak a different language to us but have a similar culture . 
    canada seems a little bit closer to us politically but quite north american culturally and australia and new zealand have a lot in common with the uk but with their own distinct identities as well .

  the other usage is a subdefinition . 
  apart from guyana and some islands that do have english as official languages , i should think the rest of central/south america should call us whatever they want in spanish/portuguese/french / dutch/whatever .

  even going by your definition , you answered none of this post 's question . 
  title :  what ** immigrants ** are welcome to finland and what are not according to a survey ... european comment :  for an ** american ** to ** immigrate ** to finland , they have to be at least somewhat wealthy and have a job lined up . 
  they have to demonstrate that they are capable of taking care of themselves without needing ( much ) assistance from the government . 
  and before all this , they have picked finland of all places to ** emmigrate ** to - a small country with a difficult language in the north-eastern corner of the continent . 
  to even consider this option they probably either have a very lucrative job offer or are personally interested in the country and culture and becoming part of it . 
  coming from a western society there is no reason to assume they could n't ** integrate ** . 
  my response :  i mean , ** immigrating ** is kinda in the genes of americans . 
  anywhere we 're willing to go , we ** integrate ** . 
  and that includes other places within america , which is diverse as a country gets . 
  the last sentence just meant that moving from one part of america to another can be little different than emigrating from america . 
  ** if you do n't want to others to talk about america/immigration , do n't talk about america/immigration . 
  what ? 
  first off , ** i never said anything close to that . 
  ** this post is n't about america , it 's about a pleasant exchange between americans and europeans . 
  i shared an american viewpoint on americans with regard to immigration , responding to a european 's comment on americans with regard to immigration , in a post about *** immigration . 
  *** i think you need the lesson in context . 
  i have n't asked a question here about europe before ( other than this post ) , because i have n't asked a question here before , because i do n't self-post often . 
  but [ i have participated here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/506nvf/in_the_us_and_canada_high_school_students/d71xbjd?context=3 ) before , sharing an experience i felt united me with a european . 
  this is precisely the hostility i 'm talking about . 
  you 're treating me suspiciously , fabricating plain falsehoods , and blaming me for the acts of others .

  mayotte is n't in europe . 
   why not canada for each province as well ?
