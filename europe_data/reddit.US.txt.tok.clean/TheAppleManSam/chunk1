i could see russia attacking a weakened nato where america has withdrawn a significant amount of resources & europe has n't upped it 's power projection capabilities to compensate . 
  people tend to forget just how scary nuclear warfare is , and just how long western leaders will have to think of it 's cost if , for say , russia launches a lightening strikes on the baltics and deploys tactical nukes there with the threat of using them if the eu tries to dislodge them conventionally . 
  wars like that will be decided in their opening moments , and a russian offensive would have to be repelled in a quickly & timely manner before they could establish control & begin to dig in . 
  an things like that require power projection & speed of response . 
  two things europe is severely lacking in comparison to america . 
  the wars of tomorrow , in my opinion , are going to be quick , limited & decisive for those very reasons , hence why you have countries like china focusing on those very things in their military doctrine . 
  luckily america would never allow a nato country to fall because it 'd undermine every other alliance we have on the planet . 
  we also have the largest reserve of expeditionary forces & most expansive power projection capabilities on the planet to prevent that very type of thing from happening . 
  but who knows where nato , or america , will be in twenty years . 
  who knows what will happen if america has to fight something like that while simultaneously dealing with the same type of war in south china sea . 
  one or the other could end in full-blown nuclear war if russia is confident enough in starting it * ( especially if america looks distracted by china & has less power projection assets in europe ) * , but america is committed to finishing it should , for example , we actually loose the baltics in those opening battles & move to take them back no matter the cost * ( which i very well could see us doing ) * . 
  i do n't think it 's something that we should be seriously concerned about now , but in a generation or twenty years it could be a very real possibility if europe does n't up it 's military spending and/or strengthen eu military integration . 
  too what end ? 
  let 's say we intervene . 
  it 's damn well guaranteed nato will route any russian forces in ukraine . 
  and since [ russia considers limited nuclear strikes to be * `` de-escalation '' * ] ( http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation ) , it 's pretty much inevitable that they 'll deploy tactical nukes to not only cover their retreat , but force a stalemate . 
  and it 's almost inevitable we 'll respond in kind . 
  so now we have situation where if we deescalate , parts of ukraine are radioactive wastelands , and if we escalate to icbms , large chunks of the globe are radioactive wastelands . 
  and ukraine still remains divided . 
  the only hope nato has of intervening in ukraine without setting off a nuclear confrontation is if we stop at east ukraine 's border & allow ukraine to be divided , * ala * east-west germany or north-south korea . 
  of course this would make any chance of ukraine remaining a united , cohesive entity being dead in the water . 
  half-of-me actually thinks that 's what putin wants , since it 'll give him the * cassus belli * to flood east ukraine with troops and keep it in russia 's sphere-of-influence . 
  but if we want ukraine to remain united , if we want ukraine to remain a single country , all the hope we have is to stay on the sidelines , play russia 's game of limited warfare , and hope through enough military/civil aid , perhaps even training missions in nato countries & even cia or covert spec ops missions in aid of ukraine , as well as the intelligence sharing that goes with it , ukraine will be able to throw off he yolk of russian occupation independently . 
  it really just comes down to if we think there 's still a chance of ukraine staying united & russia not going in full-force . 
  china 's moves in central asia were going to happen regardless of ukraine . 
  this just made it happen sooner since it allowed china to leverage deals very much in it 's favor & distracted russia by forcing it to put all it 's focus on the west . 
  i do n't think it 's so much that as it was [ paul bremer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_bremer ) being a incompetent fuckwit who based his decisions more on righteous ideology than realistic practicality . 
  he thought we could rebuild iraq from the ground-up ; free of any baathist influence . 
  so he fired the most experienced & capable iraqi military officers and civil administrators . 
  that put a bunch of jobless military men & organizers on the streets with no hopes of advancement in many cases other than joining the insurgency , which only helped rip open sectarian strife . 
  it was n't until patreaus came in and helped stitch those wounds back together with a huge troop surge & ability to convince the sunni tribal leaders to throw out al-qaeda & begin working with the iraqi government * ( bags of money & the hugely increased american presence to help gurantee security probably being of no little help i imagine ) * . 
  unfortunately , by the time we managed to do that , maliki had already entrenched himself in power thanks to years of sectarian strife , and given that the referendum deciding the american occupation 's future happened so soon after patreus had managed to really begin to get a grip on the situation , our image was still hurt badly & it put us in a position where the only way we could stay was if we aquised to allowing our troops to be tried by iraqi courts ... which no american president would 've ever agreed too ... ** edit : ** although probably the greatest mark against american foreign policy in this matter is the fact we went into iraq over a bullshit wmd excuse instead of just saying we 're going in to topple a genocidal dictator . 
  i mean fucking really . 
  we might 've caught more flack in the short-term , but at least it would 've been better for our long-term image instead of damaging it for decades to come . 
  well , i think the majority of iraq actually * did * support the intervention at first . 
  i mean , say what you will about saddam , but he was still a genocidal dictator who oppressed his people with a iron fist . 
  it was n't until after we fucked the early part of occupation with bremer that public opinion began to shift . 
  by the time of the troop surge & sunni awakening , when we managed to really get full control of the situation again under patreus , the damage to our image had already been done & we would never get that extra time back to fully stabilize the situation before we left . 
  another great article touching on this very thing : [ ** russia 's in the driver 's seat , but china 's buying the car ** ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/qishloq-ovozi-russia-china-hegemony/25474182.html ), 
  ** against ( * in the case of intervening to oust russia from all of ukraine * ) ** . 
  for one simple reason : * conventional superiority of nato & the almost guaranteed use of tactical nuclear weapons by russia because of it . 
  * if we intervene in ukraine , we will win , we will route the russians , and i have no doubt that the russians * will * deploy tactical nuclear weapons to cover their retreat and/or force a stalemate because of that . 
  then we 'll inevitably return the favor in kind until escalation to icbms or deescalation into a stalemate . 
  * best case scenario : * only big chunks of ukraine become radioactive wasteland . 
  * worst case scenario : * huge chunks of the entire world become radioactive wasteland as we escalate to icbms & wide-spread thermonuclear warfare . 
  i think we should be supplying the ukranians with as much aid , both military & civil , as we can . 
  even training them in neighboring nato countries . 
  we should step up intelligence sharing & perhaps even send in covert special ops teams conducting black ops in support of the ukrainian government . 
  not to mention keeping up the pressure with economic sanctions against russia . 
  but ukraine is not in nato . 
  it is not even in the eu . 
  while i would be okay with going nuclear over the baltics , pissing blood & loosing my hair because of it , we have to draw the line somewhere . 
  and in my opinion , that line is nato , and possibly the eu in general . 
  but nato is the only one who deserves unshaking support in such a scenario . 
  ** however ( * in the case of intervening in only western ukraine to deter russia * ) : ** if we were to intervene in ukraine , our best bet would be to stop at the border of east ukraine . 
  it 'd split ukraine in two , kill any chance of reunification for generations , if not a century or more , but west ukraine would be safe at the expense of russian domination in east ukraine , while probably avoiding the above nuclear confrontation . 
  although any chance of ukraine being a single , cohesive & united entity would be dead in the water with such a move . 
  half-of-me would n't even be surprised if this is something russia actually * wanted us to do * though as it would give them * cassus belli * to basically flood into east ukraine and turn the situation into something * ala east-west germany or north-south korea . 
  oh yeah , i know , but that kinda underlies my point . 
  it was chipped away piece-by-piece instead of reformed all-at-once * ( thus the last vestiges of hereditary or spiritual peers has always been kept in one form or another , belying any attempt for a democratic mandate to justify increased powers ) * . 
  and a weak upper house has been so entrenched in tradition by now that i just ca n't see it easily being reversed , hence why i ca n't see commons suddenly being keen on the idea of justifying a powerful lords by giving them a democratic mandate through elections . 
  i see the pros of a small , technocratic body that , while not a equal , acts as a guide to the lower house . 
  i do n't quite ... agree with it personally ... in the context of * countries * with national or state divisions , but * i understand it * . 
  in a sense you 're right , but i think it 's intentional to a degree , with congress designed to be purposefully slow so as to pretty much force compromise between the two houses . 
  i do n't know about the lords . 
  it 's present structure is a lot more organic than ours given that it 's powers & authority have been pretty much chipped away at piece-by-piece since the turn of the last century instead of set in stone with clear restrictions . 
  plus , i just do n't think a powerful upper house * ( not saying you would support such , only speaking theoretically ) * could ever exist in the uk * ( or the western world for that matter ) * without a democratic mandate , and i just ca n't see the house of commons willfully sacrificing their authority or endangering it by giving the lords that * ( a all-elected body ) * . 
  the most i could see is the hol being entirely compromised of life peers * ( it 's already mostly there ) * that are professionals in their fields , which would probably appease a lot of british people * ( from my own personal experiences , since it seems many of your fellow countrymen want to maintain a weak upper house , but still get rid of the last vestiges of hereditary & spiritual peers ) * while preserving the house of commons ' authority as the only part of parliament with a full democratic mandate to rule . 
  for the american system though , i would only change two things structurally : * electoral districting put in the hands of the judicial branch to counter gerrymandering * electoral college organized along the congressional district method , with the electoral votes being distributed based on the popular vote winner within each of the state 's congressional districts ; the statewide popular vote winner receiving two additional electoral votes representative of the senate seats . 
  instead of this full-range fptp bullshit with * all * of a state 's electoral votes going to the state 's overall popular vote winner . 
  could n't hotlink this above , but for context : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_ ( united_states ) #congressional _ district_method, 
  the house & senate are relatively balanced , with some key differences . 
  but the senate is much more powerful than the uk 's house of lords , and if the senate opposes a bill * ( or amends it ) * it 'll go straight back to the house of representatives , instead of just being delayed before it reaches the president . 
  some of the differences i mentioned are like how only the house can propose a spending bill * ( although it still has to be approved by , and can be amended by , the senate ) * and the president needs to have the senate confirm * ( by majority vote ) * appointments of cabinet secretaries , federal judges , other federal executive officials , military officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , and other federal uniformed officers . 
  the senate also has to consent to treaties as a precondition to their ratification . 
  so while the president can form & negotiate one , the senate needs to approve it . 
  the house does n't get to vote on it , but if the implementation of the treaty requires the expenditure of funds , the house can block , or at least impede , it 's implementation by refusing to vote for the appropriation of the necessary funds * ( which ties into my earlier point about only the house being able to propose spending bills ) * . 
  additionally , only the house can impeach a government official * ( strip them of their office & authority ) * with a simple majority vote , but the impeachment trial itself is held by the senate which needs 2/3rds to convict . 
  the house also has the power to elect the president if no presidential candidate receives a majority of votes in the electoral college , but the ec has only ever been deadlocked twice in our history * ( and the last one happened close to two hundred years ago ) * . 
  congress can also override a presidential veto if they pass a piece of legislation with a 2/3rds majority in each house . 
   i live in illinois . 
  it is kind of aggravating to live in a state in the us with a big population and know how underrepresented you are in the us senate . 
  your state is not underrepresented in the senate , it 's equally represented . 
  we 're not a * unitary state * . 
  we 're a * federation of states * . 
  it 's not unfair nor unequal if the whole point of the upper house is for every state to be afforded exactly 2 senators , no matter their population . 
  it sounds to me like you 're less aggravated about the senate and more aggravated about the idea of the united states being a federation that recognizes * ( in a sense ) * it 's constituent states as equal members in a balanced union * ( who 's individual populations and the extra influence/standing they entail is acknowledged through the lower house ) * . 
  ** tl ; dr germany is using it 's influence to help weaken & drain much of the eurozone to it 's own benefit , america came out of the recession in 2009 & recovered all the ground it lost by 2012 , the eurozone on the other hand had a double-dip recession which it only came out of last year and it 's still is faced with stagnant growth while being on the verge of deflation ** what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  why are you congratulating the rest of europe ? 
  that 's like congratulating somebody after they get their foot chopped off . 
  the only reason germany has become a powerhouse is because they 've used the eurocrisis , which has brought the south to it 's knees , to consolidate as much industrial capital as they can within germany to the determinant of the rest of the eurozone given a artificially undervalued exchange rate meant to boost their exports thanks to german influence on the euro . 
  the only reason they 've managed to stay there is because of germany 's staunch refusal to consider fiscal transfers to help bolster southern industries & economies while being adamant about the implementation of austerity , thus basically keeping the south on their knees & killing any hope of a sustainable recovery . 
  the european union has * always * been comparable , and economically bigger , than the united states as a whole . 
  only now , instead of us watching it see stable , broad-based growth , we 're watching it have unstable , german-focused growth that 's basically turning the entire continent into a extension of the german export machine while boosting german influence in the eu as a whole , influence that will only continue to grow unchecked if we see a brexit happen . 
  i mean ... jesus ... where have you been for the past couple years ? 
  when the united states recovered all the ground it lost in 2012 , while the eurozone had a double-dip recession that it only came out of last year , still looks like it 'll have nothing but stagnant growth for the next couple years & continues to exist on the verge of deflation . 
  it does in a sense , given the time it was implemented & what defined the socioeconomic conditions during the short period it was flown officially . 
  but than again , one could say the british flag & many other european flags ar n't exactly ... ugh ... * representative * of freedom & progress given some of the * long * periods they were flown through . 
  i do n't know nor much care to be honest . 
  i 've got friends in my circle who have it tattooed on them and our circle is full of black people who really just do n't give a fuck and we 're all really tight having grown up together and such .
