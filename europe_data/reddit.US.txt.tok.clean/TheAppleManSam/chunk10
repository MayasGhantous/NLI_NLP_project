  i guarantee we have just as many , in fact , i 'm damn near 100 % sure we have many more boots on the ground right now than france .

  i * highly * doubt that . 
  especially considering the fact we have a much more advanced & expansive isr * ( intel & recon ) * network than the french & we 've just dropped about as much ordinance on isis positions in syria within two days as we did in iraq for the past month . 
  i mean ... come on ... that 's 200 munitions , most precision-guided , as well as some of 47 tomahawk cruise missiles compared to the some 253 bombs and missiles we 've hit isis in iraq with .

  mali stands testament to that .

  it truly is unmatched by any one nation , specifically so in the realm of power projection .

  really .

   [ ** deflation would be the stuff of nightmares for european economies ** ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/07/deflation-secular-stagnation-europe-economic-nightmare )  the world has been haunted by the fear of deflation since the 30s . 
  now it is a very real prospect for the eurozone  ------------------------------------------------------  * `` just as a bad cold leads to pneumonia , so over-indebtedness leads to deflation , '' * wrote the us economist irving fisher in 1933 . 
  the theory is , if there is too much debt , people spend all their money repaying it and so stop spending . 
  prices fall -- inflation turns to deflation . 
  what could be bad about falling prices ? 
  well , the debts do n't shrink -- so you end up using more of your income to service them , and you spend even less . 
   this actually happened in the us between 1929 and 1933 , leaving economists like fisher -- and indeed the whole of society -- terrified of it happening again . 
  economists call this the debt-deflation spiral , and since 2008 politicians have been haunted by the prospect of a repeat . 
  [ ** fitch warns that europe could be facing a ` doom loop ' ** ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com.au/fitch-warns-of-europe-doom-loop-2014-9 )  if you were n't already convinced about what a nightmare deflation would be for the eurozone , credit ratings agency fitch has a grim report out , showing the sort of issues the struggling bloc could be hit by . 
   * `` a classic debt deflation feedback loop could ensue , '' * according to the authors . 
  among economists , that 's better known as the `` doom loop . ''  a total lack of growth and inflation could put huge pressure on national budgets , and cripple the ability of governments to assist struggling banks , with credit ratings slashed all round . 
  [ ** the case for worrying about european deflation ** ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/09/17/the-case-for-worrying-about-european-deflation/ )  fitch ratings reckons that the eurozone is in the grip of bad deflationary pressures through lower aggregate demand . 
  not everyone agrees with this , but fitch is also hardly alone in this view . 
   david beckworth , an economist who authored a much-cited paper on deflation in 2008 , is roughly in agreement with fitch . 
  he has looked into overall spending in both spain and italy -- the largest and most dangerous cases of deflation in the eurozone -- and does n't think the results are pretty : there is some evidence in spain of a small , recent rise in spending but that 's about it .
