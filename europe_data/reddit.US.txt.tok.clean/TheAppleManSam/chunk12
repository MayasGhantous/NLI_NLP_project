  the eurozone really does need to learn a thing or two . 
  the united states is not europe 's greatest threat . 
  europe 's greatest threat is itself . 
  seriously . 
  america does n't fear a united europe standing beside it in the west ; it fears being the only west left with a divided europe . 
  well , that 's all great & all , but you 'd still have to let us in if you guys let canada in . 
  seriously . 
  europe is based around a continent , not a idea . 
  europe as a continent make idealize certain ideas , and might possess world territories which are the left-over colonies of past european empires , but it in itself is not defined primarily by a idea . 
  there will be a north american union before there is a european union in north america . 
  that and america would push so fucking hard against such a scenario that the eu would find itself in a political hellhole the likes of which it has never seen before . 
  why should you take the advice of people who pushed a economy into a double-dip recession , reduced it to stagnant growth & who now have caused it to teeter on the edge of deflation ? 
  better than a double-dip recession , stagnant growth & being on the verge of deflation . 
  think of fox news & msnbc as one hand jacking off and the other punching itself in the face . 
  they switch up every couple of years though . 
   how exactly is that better than nomination by an independent organisation ? 
  because it constitutes a representative democracy ? 
  and it 's actually have authority & influence to balance out the lower house ? 
   england dominates the commons by mp count because it is considerably more densely populated than scotland . 
  less citizens means less representation . 
  if scotland was to have a larger representation then they would be disproportionately measured . 
  no shit sherlock that 's my point . 
  lol if you 're going to act like england , scotland , wales & north ireland are separate , but equal countries than you got ta treat them like that too . 
   typical fucking american . 
  thinks they know everything about everything . 
  you know what the citizen approval for your congress is ? 
  perhaps you should get your own affairs in order before making fun of other countries . 
  yes , typical ** american ** , ** german ** & ** australian ** ways . 
  how crazy of us wanting legislatures that are representative of not only our constituents , but our constituent states as well . 
  crazy . 
   by the way , you mentioned the queen earlier when you were blathering on about your `` revolutionary '' ways . 
  you might be interested to know that she has 90 % approval ratings . 
  looks like the people are happy with the monarchy . 
  come back when your head of state gets even 2/3 of that . 
  she also does n't do shit publically so she does n't have to take the blame publicly . 
  lol nor did i know you could actually compare legislatures to ceremonial semi-executives ... but meh ... an i 'm sorry if i do n't want to entrench a single family permanently on a throne , within the upper echelons of my government & society , with access to our highest government leaders every week , while giving them no responsibility at all other than huge paychecks & ability to manipulate my government behind the scenes . 
   i mean shit , bush & clinton might have dynasties going ... but at least we do n't give the fucks a palace and crown ... 
  besides , this has nothing to fucking do with the queen you fool . 
  lol does australia not share the queen ? 
  yet ... they 're a federation with an actually proper upper house ... an i brought up the american bit because you 're acting like a condescending bitch & i wanted to get a rise out of your inferiority complex . 
  it worked . 
   because they are elected politicians and will lie to get their seat just like those in the commons do . 
  the lords are nominated based on their achievements . 
  which can be checked against by being appointed by their legislature instead of a popular vote ... but i still back the popular vote idea ... and you know ... representative democracy is pretty cool ... hence why the house of lords has little authority relative to the lower house & your queen is only a figurehead ...  the commons are the ones who have pushed scotland towards independence not the lords . 
  and the government is dominated by england because england dominates the lower house & there is no upper house with real authority to check that ; one that is n't equally representative of all the united kingdom 's constituent states and can properly balance out the more populous states ... 
  i mean ... one of the major issues scotland has is that england has undue influence & scotland has too little say ... this seems like the perfect fix that would wipe away any say of secession for generations too come ... not to mention do the same for wales & north ireland ...  hereditary peers were abolished in the house of lords act 1999 . 
  please do some research before making incorrect claims . 
  and hereditary peers still exist , 92 of them are still permitted to have seats in the house . 
  you know who else is permitted ? 
  26 bishops of the church of england . 
  an all the life peers are appointed by a monarch . 
  which ... i do n't know ... i kinda like state legislatures doing the appointing better ... but that 's just me and my revolutionary 21st century ways ... you should really do some research before you 're corrected by a american . 
  why would n't a senate do the same ? 
  i mean ... that 's the whole point of a upper house ... longer terms * ( or appointed by their legislature ) * so they have less to worry about when it comes to politiking & elections ... while also remaining representative of their constituents * ( even if they 're indirectly appointed by their respective legislature ... which i still think would be a vast improvement over the status quo ) * and balancing out the interests of the constituent states * ( so a single one , due to a larger population , does n't completely dominate the lower house & thus the national government ) * ... plus in this scenario the upper house would actually have real influence & power to check the lower house ... which the house of lords does n't really have besides being able to throw up a few minor roadblocks ... so i do n't understand your implication ... it 's not only a unbalanced & archaic institution ... but a almost useless one as well ... 
  i mean ... why in the fuck would you deny a senate for a institution which has alienated the uk 's constituent parts , pushed one towards secession & preserved a vestige of feudalism ? 
  fight against the very ethos of anarchism by helping support a huge & aggressive neighboring country with gigantic amounts of state control & corruption ? 
  one that wants to annex you & make you a satellite state so it can have a buffer between it and the europea nunion ? 
  like i said , you 're a stupid neckbeard with a inferiority complex who 's only reason for going against the grain is to grab attention . 
  same reason you have that flag . 
  lol * pats on head * , 
  you 're a anarchist who supports putin 's regime & his actions in ukraine ? 
  * lol alright *, 
  are ... are you trying to substitute reality with your own version with it ? 
  because you sound fucking deluded . 
  lol the united kingdom will remain in the european union , nato , five eyes , commonwealth & united nations . 
  none of the organizations are going to try & kick them out , nor will they consider them to * not * be the united kingdom of the past in legal terms scotland wo n't . 
  scotland will have to reapply . 
  scotland will be considered a new entity completely & separate from the united kingdom as a institution . 
  these are facts . 
  this is reality . 
  you 're a idiot if you deny that or try to ignore it . 
  i think you 're just a teenage neckbeard with a inferiority complex seeking attention . 
  i think sucking putin 's cock goes against the grain and that 's why you like it because it helps you stand out . 
  well , not everyone accepts that . 
  especially alex salmond . 
  [ ** alex salmond insists independent scotland would remain in eu ** ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/28/alex-salmond-independent-scotland-remain-european-union )  scottish first minister says it would be absurd for secessionist scotland to re-apply to join european union  --------------------------------------------------------------  alex salmond has put himself on a collision course with westminster and the european union by insisting that an independent scotland would automatically remain in the eu while still enjoying the uk 's key opt-outs from the eu regime . 
   in a set-piece speech on scotland 's place in europe , delivered in bruges to echo margaret thatcher 's bravura 1988 performance , the scottish first minister dismissed as absurd statements in brussels and london that a secessionist scotland would need to re-apply to join the eu . 
   ------------------------------------------------------------------  salmond also insisted that the new scotland would retain the sterling currency and remain , like the rest of britain , outside the eu 's schengen travel zone . 
  if he is right , scotland would be afforded special treatment that has been denied all new member states joining over the last decade . 
   the assertion was challenged by hague . 
  * `` how will you convince all 28 member states to unanimously agree to grant special opt-outs to scotland ( on the euro , or membership of the schengen area ) which all recent member states have had to adopt themselves ? 
  ** scotland will not be a successor nation to the united kingdom because the united kingdom still exists . 
  ** how ... how is this hard to comprehend ? 
  the united kingdom , from a legal perspective , is not disappearing or disintegrating . 
  there is no need for a successor state because there 's no defunct state to succeed . 
  the united kingdom is n't * agreeing * to split itself apart . 
  it 's * allowing * a member to leave . 
  ** the united kingdom still does , and will , exist as the institution we know it as now . 
  it is not disintegrating or splitting up like the soviet union or czechoslovakia , which is what your post implies ; it is loosing a member . 
  ** scotland is * leaving that institution * . 
  the institution which joined the european union & signed those eu treaties is * staying * , scotland is * leaving * . 
  scotland is n't sharing the foreign responsibilities & commitments of the united kingdom , why should it be allowed to share the foreign benefits ? 
  i mean , the only reason to oppose that is if you want to screw the united kingdom over . 
   i mean ... it 's already established that scotland would n't be in organizations like nato , the commonwealth , the united nations and five eyes right off the bat ... thus having to reapply to them ... why is this different ? 
  the member states ar n't splitting in two . 
  the united kingdom is n't disintegrating like czechslovakia . 
  it will still exist as a institution , upholding all the agreements it 's signed * in the name of the united kingdom * because * it is the united kingdom * . 
  scotland would be * breaking away * from the united kingdom , not * breaking up * the united kingdom . 
  why not just have a british senate instead of a house of lords ? 
  with five senators from wales , england , north ireland & scotland ?
