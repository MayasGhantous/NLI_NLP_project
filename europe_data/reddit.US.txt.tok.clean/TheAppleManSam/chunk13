  one elected each year by popular vote * ( or appointed by their respective legislature ) * ? 
  with each country having powers/authority akin to german/american states with westminster as the federal government ? 
  i do n't think the different countries would need a bicameral legislature either , just a unicameral one . 
  since they 'd remain unitary while the overall goverment became federal . 
  even in a equally-represented uk with a balanced upper house , london would still be the focal point of investment . 
  i do n't understand why it 's not a federation already . 
  the house of lords is archaic institution that the aristocracy & monarch can use to roleplay their glory days . 
  it 's not fit to be a modern political institution representative of today 's united kingdom . 
  i ca n't express how maddening it is to see our closest ally shoot itself in the foot & disintegrate because they ca n't fucking get rid of a medievil institution . 
  i mean , you get a upper house to balance the interests of wales , northern ireland & scotland , & the lower house will still be dominated by england , but at least balanced . 
  i do n't see the cons . 
  that said , / u/right _ in-the-pussy , you 're not ukrainian , you 're irish . 
  i 've never seen you talk about living in ukraine or your experiences there , i 've never seen you talk about being ukrainian , but * i have seen you * suck putin 's cock , defend russia 's actions in ukraine as justified , talk about living in ireland & being irish , as well as complain about uk problems . 
  odd . 
  the american-version of a japanese ninja warrior . 
  i do n't think yo 're selfish or inconsiderate , just a idiot with a superiority complex . 
  i was under the impression that certain countries like australia , canada & new zealand were legislated sovereignty by westminster instead of declaring independence by themselves . 
  and iirc , i do n't even think new zealand wanted to leave the * ( formal ) * empire . 
  how is it a substandard service ? 
  and how do you think they can afford the production costs to make these shows ? 
  crime shit ? 
  like the wire , breaking bad , boardwalk empire , orange is the new black , true detective , the killing & the sopranos ? 
  his cuntishness would be unsurpassed for years to come . 
  no , seriously , minarets were outlawed in a referendum . 
  but were loud-ass church bells ? 
  shut up parthian scum . 
  agreed . 
  the romans were pretty civilized . 
  not the biggest humanitarians though ... . 
  [ hey ] ( http://cdn1.thisisinfamous.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/reference.jpg ), 
  hopefully for the united states our lord & savior google will come to our salvation . 
  but on the plus side at least we 're not canada . 
  you do n't have a monopoly on what defines caution or how somebody exercises it . 
  and i did n't realize proceeding with caution was synonymous with halting completely . 
  you should invest in a dictionary . 
   anyone with the capacity to communicate would realise that i always meant direct democracy . 
  * followed by : *  you were n't necessarily describing elected representatives with that description . 
  lol, 
  switzerland is a representative democracy . 
  it also has the population of the netherlands with twice the economy . 
  ** but tell me : ** how many minarets are in switzerland ? 
  how many church bells are in switzerland ? 
  what percentage of the swiss population is muslim compared to christian ? 
  dude , you pointedly said * `` mob rule '' * specifically would be a improvement & a refinement compared to the present situation . 
  you did n't even begin to distance yourself from the term until the last two posts . 
  and yes , elected representatives are aristocrats . 
  lmao, 
  no , i 'm not saying it will automatically lead to that , but i am saying it increases the chances of minorities being abused , scapegoated & taken advantage of . 
  i am saying it 's easy to use populist bullshit to sway the mob 's opinion no matter what else is happening . 
  i 'd probably be one of them too . 
  we all think we 're special & logicial 'till we get caught up in some emotional bullshit . 
  yes , i have a disdain for huge groups of people making decisions when emotions are running high . 
  i 'd rather that huge group of people elect a small group of representatives to negotiate their problems & compromise in a civil matter . 
  oh , really ? 
  you 've never seen a peaceful protest spiral into a violent one thanks to aggitators ? 
  you 've never seen the mob mentality take over ? 
  i have , and the shit ai n't pretty . 
  innocent people who came to protest peacefully end up getting fucked up in the cross-fire . 
  oh , and you call the police ? 
  what police ? 
  this is mob rule baby . 
  if the mob is upset the mob has the advantage . 
  ai n't you ever see a riot baby ? 
  i do n't think you know how this works . 
  lol, 
  ** representative democracy help check mob rule , helps slow down the emotional tidal wave , in the interests of maintaining a stable & civil society * as is possible * ; mob rule helps ignite violent revolutions & collapse representative democracies with no checks or road blocks to slow it down . 
  ** in fact , a number of those cases were stopped from spiraling completely out of control * ( as a fuckton of examples in history attest to ) * because you had representatives you elected to negotiate & compromise for you instead of just throwing two emotional mobs against each other . 
  why would taking away representative democracy & making it easier for the mob be a good idea !?!? 
  like ... holy fuck ... just because i kick down your door to punch you in the face does n't mean you should swear off doors . 
  representatives help check it . 
  the patriot act was bad , but i do n't have a god damn doubt it could 've been a lot worse . 
  and if hitler did n't fucking coup the shit and completely bypass the system to enact populist bullshit to appease the mob , than yeah , maybe shit would be different . 
  but it 's not . 
  i do n't understand why you think mob rule is a good fucking idea when you see how the public reacts in times of crisis or in relation to emotionally sensitive shit like we saw with that * `` sharia police '' * or 9/11 . 
  or hell , better yet , just with gypsies in general . 
  am i stupid for thinking that in times of crisis people act irrationally & put emotions ahead of logic ? 
  yep , so stupid man , so stupid . 
  like mob rule as you pointed out elsewhere . 
  which , in your words , would be both * `` revitalizing '' * and a * `` improvement '' * . 
  you know , because that turned out well in the past . 
  the french revolution with the reign of terror , the public sentiment in 1930s germany , american public 's response to 9/11 , many europeans ' response to gypsies & muslims not assimilating or just simply growing in number , persecution of jews on both sides of the atlantic , the russian imperial family * ( including the children ) * , mccarthyism , american race riots , the sectarian tensions during the troubles in northern ireland ; all fine examples . 
  if there 's one group you can trust in times of crisis & high emotion , it 's the mob . 
  yeah , have fun when the next 9/11 happens , or a gypsy murders some middle-class family or some muslims decide to slap * `` sharia police '' * on their back . 
  let alone be in eastern europe when russia starts shit . 
  like , you 're either ignorant or willingly blind to history . 
  you think the patriot act was bad ? 
  crack open a fucking history book . 
  from the reign of terror during the french revolution to nazi germany in the 1930s to american race riots . 
  yes , well , let 's see how practical that is . 
  that 's retarded & you should feel bad for advocating it . 
  i 'll give my life before i let the mob mentality & emotional bullshit dictate every aspect of our government . 
  not to mention just the inefficiency & delusional expectations that such entails . 
  should * any * government discussions & high-level ** draft ** negotiations in the arena of foreign policy be afforded discretion ? 
  the whole point of representative democracy is to avoid mob rule . 
  and i doubt mob rule is either revitalizing or a improvement . 
  ** you 're a representative democracy . 
  ** hence why the executive you elected appoints the ambassador to negotiate the terms & the legislature you elected is charged with approving it . 
  not to mention the ambassadors themselves have to be approved by the legislature in many countries . 
  transparency over yet-to-be-decided-on terms in the middle of tense negotiations where the ball is moving everywhere ? 
  the people drafting the treaty still do n't know what it 's going to end up like because * it 's still being debated * .
