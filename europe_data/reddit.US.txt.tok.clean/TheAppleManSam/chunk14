  honestly , how would any treaties get drafted & signed if the entire public had a say in the debate & terms , which are already tense enough with a few representatives trying to compromise the differences ? 
  i mean ... what the fuck do we have legislatures & ambassadors & representative democracies for ? 
  what people ? 
  the entire population ? 
  why do we even have politicians involved in foreign politics then ? 
  what 's the point of this * `` representative democracy '' * & * `` ambassador '' * bullshit we got going ? 
  lol, 
  has germany never negotiated a treaty in private when it was in the drafting stage ? 
  are you under the impression that the start treaties were n't negotiated in private ? 
  that their exact terms were n't debated over & agreed to by russian & american diplomats behind closed doors ? 
  i do n't think you can be rich , decentralized & have a currency union all at the same time . 
  yep , german corporations have no incredible wealth or influence of their own . 
  they 're just bullied by the evil amerikkkunts . 
  i was talking about europe in general . 
  yeah , american corporations must also control germany . 
  i mean , that 's the only reason they 'd advocate austerity , right ? 
  lol and of course they do n't hate you . 
  how did you even come to that implication ? 
  that 's retarded . 
  norway is n't even in the eu & they do n't hate you . 
  i was taking about what justifies a referendum , same thing i was saying about the eu-india fta . 
  stop trying to deflect & distract from the initial point . 
  a very common approach to economics . 
  demonstrated by southern & northern european cohesiveness on austerity , inflation & fiscal transfers . 
  an let 's not ignore british & polish views of the eurozone . 
  but yeah , india or canada would n't deserve a similiar referendum . 
  i mean , why would they ? 
  india for one in no way endangers the middle class with cheap labor & in no way poses a risk with loose regulations . 
  and we see how much european politicians care about workers since they 're sending every other europeans ' job to germany . 
  lol and as i pointed out before , it 's europe that has stagnant growth & experienced a double-dip recession . 
  yeah , german & british corporations would see no benefit from this . 
  an , come on , spanish , italian & french corporations have no market in the united states . 
  no market at all . 
  for anything . 
  remember that the eu is the one who had a double-dip recession & is barely getting by with stagnant growth . 
  like the european union ? 
  or the india-eu & eu-canada ftas ? 
  you can check my statistics . 
  they 're all legit & accurate . 
  it was shameless , but it was not deliberate . 
  and you misrepresented yourself . 
  many of those include displaced jobs , not simply lost jobs . 
  that was rather misleading mr. no flair . 
   anyway , even if we lost some jobs , i 'd rather they go to mexico than china or india . 
  just like i want the ttip to go through so the global market is based on western standards & regulations instead of chinese ones . 
  it 's odd though i do n't see nearly as much opposition to the european-indian fta . 
  why is that ? 
  thank you . 
  really . 
  i ca n't tell you how many ( ??? ), 
  have made me want to bang my head against in the wall when linking wiki . 
  no , you had a shitty monitoring system and that 's why it affected such a absolutely huge portion of the industry , with seizures continuing for a entire year after the scandal first came to light . 
  if you had a good monitoring system it would ` nt of spread through-out the entire european union , in such huge quantities , and been on market-shelves for what could 've been a couple years , with seizures continuing for a whole nother year once it was found out . 
  this is especially ironic since europe had the highest rate of mad cow disease in the world only a decade before . 
  the united kingdom is actually france 's biggest & most important military partner . 
  the [ lancaster house treaties ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_lancaster_house_treaties_%282010%29 ) prove that . 
  when france needs military help or assistance , they do n't turn towards the continent , they turn towards the united kingdom . 
  the french government also see 's the united kingdom as a [ counter-weight ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28739399 ) to german influence . 
  i prefer to know what i 'm eating . 
  europe not knowing what 's in it 's meat , and apparently having large parts of the industry corrupted by organized crime , does n't help that . 
  read the link . 
  not having gone through a double-dip recession & suffering from economic stagnation like europe ? 
   an independent scotland would need to build up large currency stockpiles to successfully use the pound without a formal agreement with the rest of the uk , bank of england governor mark carney told mps on wednesday . 
   while mr carney resolutely refused to give a calculation on the precise levels required , he told mps on the treasury select committee that the experience from other countries was that central banks needed to have reserves equivalent to at least 25 per cent of gross domestic product if they used another country 's currency . 
   ---------------------------------------------------------------  mr carney also reiterated to mps that the boe had contingency plans in place for a yes vote , adding it would * `` obviously implement them if at all required in the short term . '' *  he also stressed repeatedly that the boe would remain the central bank and lender of last resort for the whole of the uk -- including scotland -- during the expected 18 month transition period . 
   asked about the risk of capital flight , mr carney said scottish banks would have access to boe facilities and scottish depositors would have access to the financial services compensation scheme . 
   the issue of [ what currency ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/e635505a-328f-11e4-a5a2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3czqozryl ) an independent scotland would use has become one of the major flashpoints of the debate after all three main westminster political parties ruled out the option of a formal currency union . 
  the scottish national party have said the position is tantamount to * `` ganging up to bully scotland '' * . 
  except on scotland 's tax revenue . 
  yes they do . 
  lol huge tax breaks & moves to avoid tax ar n't to be ignored , but they 're still bringing in a gigantic amount of money in general . 
  so there is still significant revenue coming in from them & banks like them . 
  i mean it should be a lot more tax revenue coming in , but you 're misrepresenting the situation & downplaying it by acting like the river is dry . 
  do you think switzerland would be the banking capital of the world if you did n't know what currency you 'd be using , or even if you can use the currency you 've been planning on using ? 
  yes , but in the case of * `` yes '' * some of scotland 's largest corporations ar n't going to be paying the same level of tax that they are now to scotland ... . . thus scotland is going to have a smaller corporate tax base to draw from ... 
  it does n't work like that . 
  not when you 're talking about * your * money & * your * life savings . 
  starting a voluntary run on the banks is n't going to happen . 
  ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_meat_adulteration_scandal ) you ca n't be god damn serious . 
  this has to be one of the most blindly hypocritical posts yet . 
  even in a europe subreddit you ca n't get away from ~ ~ american nationalism ~ ~ anglospherism . 
  ** ftfy **, 
  i believe i only copied a reply a single time , but in general , no , although i have repeated myself in a number of conversations that pertain to the same exact subject . 
  i do n't think a double-dip recession & stagnant economic growth is something you can call * `` successful '' * . 
  but i mean ... sure ... if that floats your boat . 
   ** war on want together with major uk trade unions and other campaigns groups has released figures ** showing that the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) currently under negotiation between the eu and usa will cost at least one million jobs if it is negotiated to its conclusion . 
  good unbiased source right there . 
  are they like the advocacy groups which talked about the millions of jobs america lost with nafta ? 
  you know , when u.s. employment increased over the period of 1993-2007 from 110.8 million people to 137.6 million people ; where within nafta 's first five years of existence , 709,988 jobs ( 140,000 annually ) , were created domestically . 
  when during 1993-2005 , the unemployment rate averaged only 5.1 % , compared to 7.1 % from 1982-1993 , before nafta was implemented ? 
  i mean , is america comparable in cheap labor to mexico in relation to the european union ? 
  is your country apart of the european union ? 
  do you know how ridiculous it looks seeing a swiss flag talking about how more european union integration is something that is n't necessary and totally undoable right now ? 
  and further integration is one way , but it 's not the only way . 
  scrapping the euro is also another solution . 
  but this present situation ... it 's not working at all unless you 're germany . 
  i 'm not saying further european integration is the only way , but it 's one way at least which would preserve the european union as we know it . 
  that was n't my point of contention . 
   latest bone to gnaw on for our american guests in / r/europe that was . 
  and even a broken clock is right two times a day .
