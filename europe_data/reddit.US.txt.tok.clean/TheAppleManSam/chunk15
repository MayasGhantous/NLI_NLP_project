  and i 'm telling you , you do n't know what the fuck you 're talking about . 
  what you * think * is impossible , and what you * think * certain actors are incapable of doing , is possible , and they are capable . 
  the reality of the politics within the european union is that the present situation favors the few & limits the many , with the few having a disproportionate amount of influence to maintain the status quo in their favor . 
  a federal state that balances the interests of everybody is preferable to a uneven currency union that only benefits the minority . 
  but than again , i do n't know why the fuck anybody would think a currency union without a strong fiscal & political union would be a good idea in the first place . 
  luckily , we can expect a fair & unbiased view which avoids hyperbole from many of our irish subscribers on this topic . 
  yes , that 's what i said . 
  we 're making them choose , but not telling them what to chose . 
  that was my intention & implication and i apologize if that was misinterpreted or i misrepresented myself . 
  and i stand by it . 
  an conspiracy theories ?

  that * of course * the european union does n't have a proper fiscal union & germany is n't wrong for opposing such . 
  but that does n't change the situation . 
  it does n't change the fact that germany is prospering & southern europe is suffering because of this . 
  that german influence is growing at the expense of those countries because of this . 
  it 's an uneven currency union that 's set-up to let germany prosper & the south suffer . 
  if germany wants the european union to work , if germany truly wants the continent in itself to prosper , it needs to back fiscal transfers . 
  even if that means growth is balanced across the eurozone instead of focused in germany .

  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7955931.stm ) ** edit : ** reply below me is referencing the comment before i edited it , which was talking about germany wanting maintain the status quo to their own benefit , but i erased it except for the above before he posted because i wanted to keep it simple . 
  if you ca n't distinguish between my problems with the german government & certain german elites , and conflate that with my feelings about the german people in themselves , how should i take every criticism a german levels against america ? 
  am i supposed to assume they hate the american people ? 
  and i am shitting my pants watching the german economy doing well at the expense of * our allies * , with germany using it 's undervalued exchange to absorb the industrial markets of neighboring countries . 
  i am shitting my pants seeing the eurozone completely fucking stagnant & on the verge of deflation while germany opposes fiscal transfers & quantitative easing because it 'd erase their export advantage over their neighbors . 
  i am shitting my pants watching germany try to move europe away from america & towards russia with their ostpolitik , shit like nordstream , throwing it 's eastern european allies under the bus to forge a informal alliance with russia at the determinant of those countries ' national security & well-being . 
  but i mean hell , after sucking the eurozone dry , you need * somewhere * to get that labor , and capital . 
  an yeah , i am shitting myself seeing the only other country who can really oppose that , who is n't completely economically fucked & can act as a proper counter-weight , the united kingdom , fragment & have it 's influence cut down significantly . 
  and i ca n't express how glad i feel that america has moved to spike that long-term strategy in the above paragraph by pressing the issue on ukraine & the baltics , making the german government & elites choose which way they 're going to go , right now and in front of the rest of the eu . 
  because if they choose russia at this point all of eastern europe , the nordics , and most others will see where germany is leaning . 
  if the rest if the eu sees germany selling out to russia it wo n't work . 
  and the faces of certain german elites at that plan blowing up in their face makes me feel smug as fuck . 
  yes , but if it did , or if a * `` europe of regions '' * movement came about that called for the break-up the federal german government so german states can be eu member-states in themselves , i 'm not so sure the same people advocating scotland separation so fervently would be advocating for that . 
  in fact , i 'm sure they 'd be as supportive of those ideas as i am of texan secession . 
  ah fuck i ca n't even argue with that because it sounds like something i would say . 
  meh have a begrudging upvote god dammit . 
  oh please pablo tell me how germany can do no wrong and it 's actually on a altrusitic crusade for the greater good of all eu nations . 
  than imply people who criticize german government policy are racist against germans & * clearly * think merkel is * le literally hitler * . 
  and the other day you were pretty fervent about scottish independence , arguing pretty heavily against the oppressive unionists , but than you got really quiet & deflective when talking about the possibility of bavarian secession or german states becoming eu member-states , not even wanting to discuss the possibility of it because * `` it would never happen '' * . 
  i do n't think southern & eastern europe are . 
  nor do i think france will be happy about their partnership being shafted for a singular hegemony .

  i love how people can point out american & russian influence , but not realize germany is basically moving to dominate the eu as a broader german power base while arranging europe for the convenience of their export machine . 
  so the united kingdom is fragmenting , spain is fragmenting , france is economically stagnant & italy is economically recessive . 
  meanwhile , even though the entire eurozone has stagnant growth , german industrial production is jumping because the german government is using the euro to undervalue their exchange rate to boost exports , thus absorbing the industries of neighboring countries & hampering them economically when they need the growth most . 
  oh , and on top of it , germany influenced the eu to give the southern nations a credit card without limit , knowing their problems with corruption & spending , with which to buy german exports , and then pretended they had nothing to do with it when the bill came due . 
  then german banks demand the terms for repayment thus increasing those countries dependence/obligation on/to germany . 
  i mean , what , greece was loaned tens of billions and now owes hundreds of billions ? 
  money spent on german exports & interest now owed to german banks ? 
  so , europe can fix this with quantitative easing to help balance out a undervalued german exchange rate & overvalued european exchange rate , as well as fiscal transfers from northern countries to southern countries to help bolster the economy , shore up production & stave off stagnation . 
  oh , and on top of all this , you have nordstream , signed into law by gerhard schroeder when he was german chancellor , and constructed under his direction as a gazprom subsidiary ceo after being given the job by putin months after leaving office ... thus having a gas pipeline built directly from russia to germany , isolating eastern europe economically , leaving them vulnerable to russian bullying * ( as we just saw when russia cut gas to poland by 20 % , since poland has been one of the most critical of putin ) * without it effecting western europe & making western europe that much more reliant on germany when discussing the flow of natural gas & russia . 
  can somebody for fucks sake assure me that the european union is n't about to turn into a * de facto * extension of the german state , with all of europe arranged for the convenience of their export machine !?!? 
  how is it europhobic to not want a single european country to dominate european politics ? 
  ** edit : ** seriously , look at the news . 
  the eurozone is a stagnant mess on the verge of deflation , yet german manufacturing is growing & german industrial markets are expanding . 
  the german government is opposed to both quantitative easing & fiscal transfers , both of which would equalize the economic situation , but at the same time erase the export advantage which allow germany to boost it 's manufacturing by absorbing the industrial markets of neighboring eurozone countries . 
  in the east you have russia cutting down gas to poland , but the west only being minimally effected because of nordstream , which germany helped fund , authorize & who 's former chancellor helped build as a executive for gazprom , thus also giving germany more leverage over other eu member-states in relation to russia & natural gas * ( while leaving eastern europe economically & politically vulnerable to russia using gas as a political weapon ) * . 
  the only bright spots & counter-weights are those countries outside the eurozone , but the united kingdom is now fragmenting & poland is still decades away from being able to truly off-set german influence . 
  but no , europhobic drivel . 
  * clearly . 
  * why would anybody have a problem with a single state coming to dominate the european union ? 
  disclose * all the information * relating to the policies for cooperation by european spy agencies on surveillance first . 
  dude , this is like my third/fouth account in three years . 
  this is what interests me . 
  international affairs & foreign politics . 
  lol though i also like / r/askhistorians & other subreddits like it . 
  well yeah . 
  that can be used on any country if we want to use a broad enough brush . 
  but al-qaeda did n't stick around and invest billions into trying to establish a more fair , democratic & humanitarian government * ( even if it 's far , far , far , very far from perfect ... it 's still 1000000x better than the taliban ) * , so meh . 
  i also do n't quite think you can compare israel to the taliban & al-qaeda , but hey , whatever floats your boat . 
  ** edit : ** also , the idf is n't based out of the united states . 
  if you think i defend all my country 's actions & interests you have n't been paying attention . 
  and you prefer to view us all as humans that transcend national borders unless that 's the scottish-english border , huh ? 
  than you get pretty nationalist as evidenced by your comment history . 
  it 's just kinda funny that you 're telling my country to get out when your country is joining the organization which keeps us around & underspending so my country has to make up the difference have a larger footprint in the region . 
  ar n't you scottish ? 
  your country is about to leave nato . 
  and then try to rejoin while not even meeting the 2 % of your gdp spending requirement . 
  you do n't really got a leg to stand on in this situation , huh ? 
  lol go out and protest against scotland joining nato if you feel so bitchy about it . 
  ** thanks to nordstream this wo n't really effect western europe !!!,

  yes , because the united states is protecting the expansion of the european union & it 's sphere-of-influence to the determinent of russia & it 's eurasian union . 
  it 's the hard power to the eu 's soft power . 
  the only variable that would change is that europe would lose a superpower as a ally , but it 'd still be at odds with russia .
