  really . 
  wow . 
  the fact that you think russia does n't see ukraine moving towards the eu , and away from any potential eurasian union , as a threat and incredible loss in not only economic terms , but cultural terms , blows my mind . 
  the fact that you do n't understand why russia would react the same way to a truly integrated & united european military protecting the baltics & being petitioned for membership by ukraine like nato is amazing . 
  really . 
  i have nothing else to talk to you about . 
  keep living in that naive little utopia you got going . 
  when the delusion of what you think the european union should be collides with the reality of what the european union is becoming , i 'll talk , but until then , i got nothing else to discuss . 
  lol, 
  are you saying that russia has n't continued any of the soviet union 's tendencies in transiteria , chechnya & now ukraine ? 
  an i mean , say what you want about georgia , but just look at the russian response & mode of operation . 
  and what about that estonian intelligence officer who was just abducted ? 
  the diplomatic spats with latvia ? 
  the russian deputy prime minister saying he 'll return to romania in a bomber ? 
  the * `` warnings '' * to finland & sweden about joining nato ? 
  the fact that [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandr_dugin ) is an adviser to state duma speaker * ( and key member of the ruling united russia party ) * sergei naryshkin , as well as the head of the department of sociology of international relations for moscow state university ? 
  yes , as is clear , the reasons for a alliance are * long gone * . 
  nobody wants to find themselves in a middle of a clusterfuck , but when you 're in it you have to keep going & try to make sure your national interests come out on top . 
  ** russia does not want ukraine in the european union . 
  this robs russia 's eurasian union of major resources , population & revenue . 
  ** ukraine , of all places , aligning with the eu is a shot right to the gut of russian pride . 
  so add in the realpolitik factors with that , and you have to be deluding yourself if you think russia is n't seriously opposed to this , like , fund , supply & coordinate a major civil war type opposed . 
  i mean , how the hell do you bring up all of america 's wrong-doing during the cold war , all of the shit we started , and think russia is incapable of doing the same ? 
  how do you put blame on us for that , but ignore the possibility of russia being to blame for the huge unrest & destabilization in eastern ukraine ? 
  is incapable of pushing their interests through the same channels ? 
  russia * needs * to have some semi-balance of serious influence in eastern europe , for the same reasons you just pointed out . 
  chinese influence is growing in central asia & chipping away at russia 's sphere-of-influence there while simultaneously the eu is doing the same thing in eastern europe . 
  russia views the eu as the threat because while america is half-way across the world , the eu is right next door & there to stay . 
  they ar n't going no where . 
  in 100 years , america might not be as involved in europe , but the european union will sure-as-fuck * ( barring collapse ) * still be there . 
  russia will still have to compete with them , while they 're competing with china . 
  russia is a wounded bear squeezed between two giants , desperately trying to claw at the former glory of the soviet union even as it slips through their fingers , yet you still think ukraine aligning with the eu * is n't that much of a big deal . 
  that 's very true , and i think the crux of the issue is the divergence between european intentions & russia 's perception of those intentions . 
  but i think we 've gone way too far down the rabbit hole to fix that & return to the status quo of yesteryear . 
  it looks like we 're all just in a big clusterfuck now with no easy way out . 
  dude , this is realpolitik , not ethnic conflict bullshit . 
  there 's ethnic friction in ukraine , but not ethnic conflict . 
  this is about economic prospects , national interests & regional hegemony between russia 's eurasian union & the european union . 
  not because of any of that other shit . 
  that 's just fuel on the fire to push the above . 
  i mean , you 're still not understanding . 
  you 're robbing russia of one of it 's most valuable eurasian members . 
  ukraine was actually set to join the eurasian union before this . 
  they 're going to push back , and they 're going to push back hard . 
  and if you ca n't protect ukraine , if you 're not willing to protect ukraine , you should 've never implied to prospect in the first place because now ukraine has to fend for itself against a huge bear . 
  i really just ... i do n't get why this is difficult to understand . 
  we 're watching a tug-o-war unfold before our eyes in eastern europe between the european union & russia . 
  the writing is on the wall & only the blind ca n't see it . 
  i mean , you know how mad russia was that nato expanded after the soviet union fell , despite the vastly improved relations with the united states ? 
  think how the fuck they feel after being so friendly with germany only to have the eu try & snatch away their backyard . 
  they 're pissed dude , and ukraine potentially joining the eu is the center of the problem , not the peripheral . 
  and you say that 's stupid , that russia would n't of invaded , but you do n't understand , russia has given up on ever having all of ukraine in the eurasian union after the kiev regime came down . 
  now they 're just grabbing at what they can , whether that be crimea or eastern ukraine , while also moving to keep western ukraine paralyzed in a frozen conflict to delay/eliminate any potential integration with either nato or the eu , thus giving them a buffer state . 
  yes , but even the implication of a prospect is perceived as a threat to russia & it 's vision for it 's eurasian union . 
  the more the door opens to the european union for ukraine , the more it shuts for the eurasian union . 
  i believe russia saw that original trade deal with the eu , and the perceived implication behind it , far to threatening to ignore ... hence why we 're here ... . and now i think russia is just trying to destabilize ukraine & keep it in a frozen conflict long enough that it 'll just serve as a buffer between them & the eu instead of a eurasian member-state or additional eu member-state . 
  personally , i believe the prospect of eu expansion into ukraine , ukraine distancing itself from russia in favor of europe & russia loosing one of it 's most valuable potential eurasian union members to the european union was just as big a threat . 
  eh , saudi arabia funding 9/11 is like the united states & ireland funding the troubles in my opinion . 
  not to say i would n't want to ditch saudi arabia for iran , but meh , we ca n't all get what we want . 
  look , let me makes myself as clear as i can possibly be : by supporting ukraine aligning itself with europe , you 're supporting it moving away from russia . 
  by supporting possible membership in the european union , you 're denying possible membership in the eurasian union . 
  ** this is russia 's problem . 
  ** you do n't seem to understand this . 
  you want ukraine to align with the european union , you want ukraine to move away from russia , but you do n't want to protect ukraine & offer ukraine security gurantees while they do so . 
  you want to just say * `` best of luck , hope you make it through '' * and watch from the sidelines as ukraine gets torn in two for taking the bait you offered . 
  i do n't support ukranian membership in nato right now . 
  i do n't . 
  but you 're a damn fool if you thought supporting ukraine moving towards europe , even if it 's the will of the people , without security assurances from the eu , was going to end * any other way * . 
  you 're robbing russia of one of the most important members of it 's proposed eurasian union , but than blame america . 
  it 's not just america . 
  it 's the european union & eurasian union competing over eastern europe . 
  america through nato is just the hard power protecting the eu 's soft power & territorial integrity . 
  take america out of the picture and you have the same picture , you 're just one superpower ally down . 
  yeah , opinions tend to shift pretty wildly when your neighbor invades you , annexes a region from you & begins funding , supplying , training & assisting separatists to tear your country in two & sow chaos with-in it . 
  you 'd be surprised how open minded people become under such circumstances . 
  i 'm a american ; so hitting back hard at not only the guys who attacked our civilian & military infrastructure , but also the guys who protected , supported & provided safe-harbor for them , is something i find justified . 
  those other guys being a horribly brutal & extremist theocracy with a atrocious human rights record helped too though . 
  a eu-wide common military would be just as militarily opposed to russia as nato is . 
  that 's what happens when you use a stick to protect your carrot . 
  russia has a smaller carrot , but a big stick too . 
  the rabbit is eastern europe . 
  you 're misreading russia the same way germany misread russia . 
  russia does n't want to join the eu . 
  russia does n't want to be apart of the european experiment . 
  russia wants to found a new order . 
  a russian-led order . 
  a eurasian experiment . 
  and the eu 's actions in eastern europe , and the eu 's attempts to draw countries into their sphere-of-influence & away from russia 's is not something russia is taking kindly too , as we see in ukraine & other places . 
  you talk about all of this * `` see it from the other side !, 
  ! 11 ! 1 '' * , but you fail to * actually see it from the other side . 
  * russia would have more influence , more potential , in a eurasian union which is dominates , not a european union where it 's checked by equals . 
  that 's why ukraine is happening . 
  russia sees the eu treading on it 's toes , not just nato . 
  russia see 's it 's loosing it 's potential eurasian member-states to the established european member-states * ( geography aside because it 's politics & you get what i 'm saying ) * . 
   the smart countries were those who managed to stay out of it . 
  you mean the 3rd world ? 
  the invasion of afghanistan itself was permitted under [ article 51 of the un charter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chapter_vii_of_the_united_nations_charter#article_51 ) & the occupation of afghanistan was authorized with [ united nations security council resolution 1386 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1386 ) . 
  there 's a number of other resolutions before that which address both of the above , and all of them were resoundingly approved . 
  vietnam was a horrible & wrong war . 
  our actions in south america were disgusting & tragic .
