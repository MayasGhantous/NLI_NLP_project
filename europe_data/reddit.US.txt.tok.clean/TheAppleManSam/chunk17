  iraq was invaded under false pretenses & the occupation was mismanaged , but honestly iraq is n't even close in fucked up shit being purposefully done when put in comparison to vietnam . 
  and i do n't get your point . 
  a eu military alliance would be just as intimidating to russia . 
  this thing over ukraine is rooted in * eu influence steeping on the toes of russian influence * . 
  of the eu 's sphere-of-influence chipping away at russia 's sphere-of-influence in eastern europe . 
  we would be having this same conversation if the eu integrated militarily , only replace nato with the eu . 
  which is why i find this situation rather amusing . 
  eu puts out olive branch to ukraine , entices ukraine with possible membership down the road , ukraine takes the bait , and what do you know , they want a security gurantee through nato since russia is invading them to stop them from going to the eu & the eu does n't have the will or ability to help them now . 
  and turkish-germans in germany & mexican-americans in the united states have to speak german & english instead of turkish & spanish in official government business . 
  they 're both incarcerated at a higher rate than ethnic germans or white americans . 
  does that give turkey & mexico the right to invade germany & the united states ? 
  and annex entire regions of them ? 
  my apologies * ( seriously ) * , but the implication * ( even if i misread it ) * that the united states has n't been pushing targeted sanctions & had to poke the eu to help get them even to these limited ones is kinda annoying . 
  regardless i should n't have used the tone that i did . 
  that was pretty childish for a internet argument . 
  and american hard power through nato and close ties with the bdr played absolutely no role in ensuring western germany 's security so they could do that ? 
  it was all soft power & that was it ? 
  you do n't think , not even for a second , that ostpolitik was possible during the cold war because west germany had american & nato protection to fall back on ? 
  that they had a secure home to extend a hand from ? 
  no ... that 'd be crazy ... 
  i find it rather amusing that people actually expect eastern european countries to want eu membership without the guarantees of nato security . 
  it 's like asking them to be targets while giving them no means to defend themselves . 
  moving past that , i think right now is the wrong time for nato membership for ukraine . 
  not sure about georgia . 
  although i do believe we should be offering military aid , intelligence & training from nato countries for the ukrainian goverment . 
  the cuban missile crisis was n't started over that . 
  we placed nukes in turkey , russia placed nukes in cuba , we took nukes out of turkey , russia took nukes out of cuba . 
  vietnam was a dirty war . 
  should 've never happened & was a major mistake . 
  thought they were russian or chinese pawns instead of a government actually just wanting it 's own sovereignty . 
  that was made abundantly clear when china invaded them right when we left . 
  but hop off the pedestal and do n't act like the north vietnamese did n't do some real fucking horrible & dirty shit either . 
  not saying that south korea was a paragon or that it was n't corrupt though . 
  eh , cold war was a bad time . 
  luckily our relations with them have been steadily improving with increased cooperation likely to rise in the future . 
   so that 's something i 'm happy about . 
  and if you remember with nixon we opened up relations with china & put ourselves on friendly terms with them despite them being communist . 
  same with yugoslavia . 
  so there 's that . 
  ** although , i have a question : ** do you think the baltics & other eastern european countries being in the european union , but not in nato , would 've worked ? 
  do you think they would trust that or have faith in their security in such a scenario ? 
  that said , did germany & others support eastern expansion of the eu to it 's present borders ? 
  there 's a difference between wanting to craft a popular image & having to ask for something out of necessity . 
  that 's not difficult to understand nor grasp , so do n't insult yourself & try to ignore the very clear difference between the two . 
  ** what are you talking about ? 
  ** what do you think the fulda gap was ? 
  why do you think western germany was in nato ? 
  why do you think there were so many troops in germany ? 
  why the fuck do you think the present german government is derived from the western german government & is still in nato ? 
  western germany , germany as we know it today , survived the cold war & became what it is today because of nato and the american hard power that underpinned it . 
  apparently younger than you mr. wwii . 
  and i 'm telling you the german government does want them there and that 's why they do n't give a damn about others getting their hands dirty as long as it 's not their hands . 
  really ? 
  that was the last time ? 
  it was n't when your country was cut in two and western germany deterred soviet invasion thanks to the nato security umbrella underpinned by the united states ? 
  you know , when american soldiers were garrisoned right across the line from the soviets ? 
  which government is the present german government derived from again ? 
  east or west ? 
  really ? 
  nordstream ? 
  hesitance to reinforce baltics allies militarily for fear of enticing russia & straining relations with them ? 
  [ ** libya , europe and the future of nato : always waiting for the u.s. cavalry ** ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato )  america was visibly reluctant to get involved , let alone lead the action . 
  and , having helped to knock out libya 's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes , it pulled back from the front-line operations . 
  but america 's role remains essential , not least in providing air-to-air refuelling , as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the european allies . 
  [ ** nato commander : eu could not do libya without us ** ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/115650 )  nato major-general marcel druart , addressing the european parliament committee on security and defence on tuesday ( 20 march ) , said nato relied heavily on us military expertise on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) capabilities . 
  [ ** dempsey : france formally asks for u.s. aid in mali ** ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/ )  the french government has formally requested u.s. military assistance to combat al qaeda in the islamic maghreb in mali , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the american forces press service on thursday [ ** french military heads threaten to resign over ` grave ' defence cuts ** ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10852165/french-military-heads-threaten-to-resign-over-grave-defence-cuts.html )  french army , navy and air force chiefs and its joint chief-of-staff threaten to resign over military spending cuts , with jean-yves le drian , defence minister , warning they would render foreign operations impossible, 
  the cold war was fucked up on all sides , our actions in latin america were a tragedy , the invasion of afghanistan was justified , iraq was invaded under false pretenses & the occupation was mismanaged . 
  ** now that we got that out of the way . 
  ** why the fuck would the eu go about building relations with ukraine , enticing it by putting membership on the table * ( even if it 's not implicitly stated ) * and then act weird when nato does that same ? 
  tell me , if the eu continues to push for ukraine to build ties with europe & integrate more into it , thus moving further away from russia , how do you guarantee that investment ? 
  how do you guarantee the security of a eu member-state * without * nato ? 
  you ca n't integrate a eastern european country into the european union without nato . 
  the baltics have proven that . 
  you just ca n't fucking do it . 
  germany just tried and it blew up in their face . 
  they thought relations with russia were good enough that they could just waltz in , snatch up ukraine & deter russia with enticements of possible eu membership * for them * down the road ... nordstream & ostpolitik & all that ... . completely ignoring russia 's own wants & ambitions with the eurasian union & their sphere-of-influence . 
  completely ignoring the fact that russia saw them more as a competitor than a partner . 
  european soft power only works when it 's backed up by american hard power . 
  when it 's not , you end up with ukraine . 
  that said : ** i ca n't see ukraine joining nato at this point in time or for the next ten years at least . 
  ** too much of a risk , too many people against it & it 's in the middle of a war with * russia * . 
  no fucking way is it happening . 
  that said , i personally believe * we should * be supplying more weapons , money & intelligence , as well set up training camps in baltic countries to help the urania military competency . 
  being defaulted means more europeans , not more americans since it 's based on ip addresses . 
  you do n't live in the balkans . 
  lol you live in one of the most developed & wealthy countries in the world which has n't had a war in 7 decades . 
  ** you know nothing of war on your own soil . 
  ** and yes , it was a long time ago . 
  as in 7 decades ago . 
  the people who recall it are in their 80s & 90s . 
  my grandfather was in a troop ship that was torpedoed by a u-boat , was at d-day & was wounded at the battle of h\u00fcrtgen forest , but that does n't give me liberty to act like i know what the fuck he 's been through or that i can empathize with what he 's been through . 
  ** and your country has n't been in ruins since then because of nato . 
  because of our commitment to you . 
  because of us garrisoning the fulda gap . 
  it 's odd . 
  nato 's borders being so far away from germany is one of the reasons germans do n't really seem to give a fuck about the baltics & eastern europe . 
  enjoy that security umbrella . 
  you can watch from a distance as the baltics have a giant hegemon right next to them threatening their very existence . 
  when was the last time you experienced your country being bombed & you saw dead soldiers in german streets ? 
  those sanctions only came about after american prodding .
