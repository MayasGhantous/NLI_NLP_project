  we had to push the issue before europe manned up & shouldered the issue . 
  and we have been at the forefront of targeted sanctions as well . 
  stop patting yourself on the back when you do n't deserve it . 
  yes , i 'm sure if the vice-chancellor or the president of the bundesrat said they would return to leningrad in a bomber plane that would n't mean anything at all . 
  oh , and imagine if they said this while germany was invading belarus & abducting russian intelligence officers . 
  there is desire . 
  i 've given you plenty of sources , many from * the guardian * no less . 
  and in case you 're confused , wales & northern ireland are also constituent countries of the united kingdom , not just england & scotland . 
  oh , and [ british overseas territories ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_overseas_territories ) * actually exist * and are under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the united kingdom itself * ( which scotland is voting on leaving , not dissolving ) * . 
  there is no reason that the shetlands should n't be afforded the same rights as both the falklands & gibraltar . 
  i mean , god forbid the people of those territories decide what to do with the future of their home and the government they 're apart of . 
  what 's that supposed to mean ? 
  that scotland would n't care about the shetlanders making their own decision if it was n't for the oil ? 
  i mean , from the gist of your post , it seems pretty fucked up to imply that scotland should n't give a shit about shetlanders & that you do n't think they deserve a chance to decide their own destiny in relation to the united kingdom . 
  is that how you feel about the falklands ? 
  northern ireland ? 
  a little hypocritical & fucked up of you , is n't it ? 
  russia & china probably would get bitchy , but america , france & the united kingdom would probably encourage it so we 're not doing it for you and diverting resources to protect you . 
  if anything i 'd support a eu nuclear deterrent , but that would still probably require nuclear weapons being stationed in germany , not to mention convincing france & the united kingdom to give up a pretty big * ( if not the biggest ) * safe-guard of their sovereignty . 
   even if there was a strong desire from the people who live on orkney or the shetland isles to become independent nations i 'm not sure i would support it . 
  it would set a precedent for regions seceding nations just because they do n't like something . 
  ** holy fuck . 
  ** that right there is wonderful ... just wonderful ... an from what i can tell it 's not so much about becoming independent nations as it is remaining in the united kingdom if scotland secedes . 
  and you still have n't answered my question about supporting a eu referendum in the uk if scotland votes no . 
  mhm , actually those american nuclear warheads are seen in a rather favorable light by the german government , if anything there 's a push to keep them there . 
  like i said , german politicians are outsourcing a nuclear deterrent to avoid the political fallout of instituting a domestic one . 
  they understand it 's a necessity , but they also understand taking on that necessity by themselves would be political suicide . 
   good , so now no more excuse to meet the ~ ~ 3 % ~ ~ 2 % gdp defense spending threshold as a nato partner ? 
  ftfy, 
  and one of the reasons germany keeps those american bases around . 
  outsourcing their nuclear deterrent to avoid the political fallout of a domestic one . 
  much easier to let others get their hands dirty in your backyard while you stand on a pedestal in the front yard . 
  you did n't answer my first question . 
  ** do you support a eu referedum in the united kingdom if scotland votes no ? 
  ** why are you avoiding this question ? 
  and shetlands would be no different than the falklands , guam , gibraltar , u.s. virgin islands , saint pierre & miquelon , the netherland 's caribbean islands or any number of other examples . 
  and there actually is a desire for independence from scotland if a yes vote goes through so as to remain in the ruk . 
  * for example : * * [ shetland asks if independence vote is chance to break away from scotland ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/30/shetland-independence-vote-scotland )  britain 's northernmost islands are beginning to question the choice before them in the scottish referendum . 
  with their own buoyant economies , could orkney and shetland opt to stay in the uk and drive themselves a better deal with westminster ? 
  * [ scottish independence : shetland islands demand own referendum ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/scottish-independence-shetland-islands-demand-own-referendum-1445116 )  many of the 23,000 inhabitants of the windswept islands have strong feelings about september 's referendum on scottish independence . 
   an online petition posted on the scottish government website demands that the shetland islands , neighbouring orkney and the western isles all hold referendums to decide whether to join an independent scotland , stay with great britain or declare independence themselves . 
   many shetlanders see the referendum as an opportunity to gain control over local services and a share of revenues from the oil pumped from the north sea . 
  * [ orkney and shetland islanders already winning scotland 's independence debate ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/20/scottish-independence-debate-orkney-shetland )  orkney 's farmers are a phlegmatic bunch . 
  sitting at the livestock auction in the town of kirkwall , coolly assessing the bullocks and heifers , the men bid for the cattle with a quick flick of the fingers before offering blunt and unsentimental views on another bidding war : next month 's referendum for scottish independence . 
  most were against . 
   ----------------------------------------------------------------  if their views and a mock referendum vote in march by orkney 's high school pupils -- where 75 % rejected independence -- are a guide , this gentle rural archipelago will vote no on september 18 . 
  in nearby shetland too , the secondary schools voted heavily to remain in the uk . 
  * [ alex salmond warning over shetland oil after independence ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9794316/alex-salmond-warning-over-shetland-oil-after-independence.html )  in a letter to the first minister , tavish scott , the shetland msp , said his constituents will `` not simply be ignored , bypassed or trodden on '' in negotiations with the rest of the uk to create a separate scotland . 
   he challenged mr salmond to confirm the snp administration 's policy towards the islands in the event of scottish independence after one of the first minister 's confidantes indicated they would have no influence . 
  his intervention came as orkney islands council announced a new constitutional reform group that will examine what deal they should seek if there is a ` yes ' vote in the referendum . 
   but stewart stevenson , a former minister , told msps on wednesday that shetland had too few residents to lay claim to any north sea oil revenues , around a quarter of which derive from fields around the islands . 
   shetland 's residents have traditionally been hostile to scottish independence and prefer westminster government to that from holyrood . 
  they were part of norway until the late 15th century . 
  ** do you support the shetlands right to self-determination in the same vein as gibraltar & the falkland 's right to self-determination ? 
  no , it does matter . 
  you would still be a british citizen of the united kingdom . 
  * do you oppose the referendum in such a situation ? 
  * and on that note , how do you feel about the shetlands ? 
  should they be given a referendum to remain with the united kingdom if the majority support such & a yes vote goes through ? 
  do you support their right to self-determination ? 
  and if scotland chooses to stay in the united kingdom ? 
  what 's your opinion of the referendum then ? 
  i do n't think the united kingdom would do it , but i can see spain doing it . 
  although pressure can & probably will convince them to change their opinions , but regardless i think it will delay scottish membership . 
  i do n't quite understand why people make so much of the oil . 
  scotland would have to trade with the eu regardless of it 's membership in it because it 'll need the money . 
  for one , the amount of oil reserves are [ * hotly * contested ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/21/questions-value-scotland-north-sea-oil-highlighted ) , and even with the snp 's large figures , it depends on oil [ remaining above $ 100 a barrel ] ( http://www.aawsat.net/2014/09/article55336387 ) , which is n't a guarantee . 
  an i think people forget how much it * costs * to extract oil , and that there are almost no truly indigenous oil or gas exploration and development companies in scotland . 
  production fell by 6 % a year on average between 1999 and 2011 , meanwhile costs are spurting upwards : it is nearly five times more expensive to extract a barrel of north sea oil than it was in 2002 . 
  that means some major tax breaks & financial incentives to drilling companies if scotland wants production to rise & exploration to continue , things that salmond will probably give , thus also lowering tax revenue . 
  i just do n't see how salmond plans to run a welfare state with low corporate taxes , a shaky currency & no guarantee of * ( immediate ) * eu membership with the economic benefits it entails . 
  throw in [ the sheltlands possibly wanting to remain in the united kingdom ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/20/scottish-independence-debate-orkney-shetland ) , the united kingdom probably supporting that heavily to get that juicy oil & salmond looking like a huge hypocrite if he chooses to oppose such self-determination , and i do n't know why the snp is leaning so heavily on oil . 
  so : * referendum for scottish separation ? 
  ** the democratic & right thing to do . 
  ** * referendum for eu membership ? 
  ** a stupid thing to do that would be a huge mistake & threaten the stability of the union . 
  worked for quebec . 
  what was the margin in that referendum again ? 
  i do n't support scottish separatism !, 
  or a yes vote could end up with scottish eu membership vetoed by spain or the uk , or at the very least delayed by a couple years , while the ruk remains in the eu . 
  just because you have two guys in a room with loaded guns pointed out each other does n't mean you should send in three more guys all with loaded guns pointed at each other . 
  all it takes is one bullet from any one of us to fuck all of us . 
  i mentioned all the german states getting sovereignty & independence did n't i ? 
  all becoming eu member-states ? 
  i covered them . 
   once again , seriously doubt your motivations & commitment to the cause . 
  and it 's as anti-german as a criticism of american foreign policy is anti-american . 
  so , based on this and your other respones , just because i criticize german policy in the eu i 'm * clearly * a racist who thinks germans are * literally * nazis ? 
  lol nice deflection . 
  i guess anytime somebody criticizes american influence or hegemony they must be racists who think we 're all slavers . 
   and i do n't care about what people think about scotland 's independence , i just seriously doubt your motivations & intentions for supporting it . 
  i want to hear you support bavarian independence first . 
  i want to hear you pay mind to the sovereignty of german states as eu member-states and the dissolution of the federal german government first . 
  well , yeah . 
  you do n't say shit about bavaria and i sure as fuck bet you do n't support german states becoming independent eu member-states with the german federal government dissolving . 
  it has nothing to do with hitler . 
  i do n't know why you bring him up at all . 
  you need to stop deflecting every criticism of your country as a racist tirade against germans based on old nazi grudges , because i can give two fucks on what happened 7 decades ago in the context of modern politics . 
  it has to do with nordstream . 
  it has to do with shitty german economic policy based on taking advantage of a undervalued exchange rate through the euro to drain & absorb the industries of neighboring eurozone countries .
