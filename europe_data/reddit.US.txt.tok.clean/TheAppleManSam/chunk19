  it has to do with german influence in giving corrupt southern eu countries a blank check for tens of billions of euros to buy german exports , and then acting like you had no fault or idea when they default , thus using your influence to get them to pay up hundreds of billions in euros while simultaneously expanding german soft power & those countries ' dependence on you . 
  and there would be no strong & influential united kingdom to off-set german influence in the context of a economically stagnant france , economically recessive italy & economically weak spain . 
  quite ironic you want to see the fragmentation & weakening of your own country 's main economic & political * ( in terms of soft power ) * rival . 
  but please , let 's watch as germany continues to use the euro to undervalue it 's exchange rate to boost exports & take over the industries of neighboring eurozone members . 
  let 's watch as the eurozone continues to stagnate & teeter on the edge of recession while german industrial production continues to jump . 
  oh , what do you know , it was recently surpassed by germany . 
  lol but the united kingdom is still close in 2nd place ... . 
  i wonder why you would possibly want to fragment & cripple germany 's most competitive rival in both economic & soft power terms . 
  not by that degree for those kind of numbers .

   * monrovia , liberia * -- the united states and britain will send medical equipment and military personnel to help contain west africa 's ebola outbreak , as the world health organization warned monday that many thousands of new infections are expected in liberia in the coming weeks . 
   the current ebola outbreak is the largest on record . 
  it has spread from guinea to sierra leone , liberia , nigeria and senegal and killed more than 2,000 people . 
  an `` exponential increase '' in new cases is expected in the hardest-hit countries in coming weeks , the un health agency warned . 
  the situations ar n't really comparable . 
  not really , since the eurozone does n't have a strong fiscal union , some of the most economically robust eu nations ar n't even in the currency union & the united states has a * much stronger * political union than the european union .

  our language , our world-class education system , and our strength in arts , sports , music and drama all attract people to visit , study and live in britain . 
  they build trust , friendship and relationships , including trading relationships . 
  the british council 's research has shown that people who have a cultural interaction with britain , especially through education , are far more likely to do business with it . 
   the government already supports businesses and creative entrepreneurs in seeking out opportunities overseas . 
  but its support for museums , universities , theatres , galleries , sporting institutions , the bbc and creative industries is vital for our global standing , as is teaching the next generation to be better at foreign languages . 
  david blair may classify this as `` domestic '' spending , but it shapes much british potential in the world . 
   a survey from the institute for government recently placed britain at the top of the global table for `` soft power '' . 
  just last week ipsos mori placed london as the number two global city ( number one in europe ) .

   the euro zone economy remained stagnant in the second quarter , as pickup in consumer spending and exports were offset by drops in investment spending and inventories coupled with an unusual large decline in construction . 
  eurostat confirmed its initial estimate of the economic activity in the june 's quarter , which booked zero growth in output from the previous three-month period . 
  that marked the second consecutive quarter of slowdown for the euro bloc , and was a key factor behind the ecb 's decision to provide additional stimulus to boost growth and inflation at its recent meeting . 
  the euro zone has been posting a mild quarterly growth steadily since the second quarter of 2013 , when the region emerged from a painful recession over a year long . 
  over the same period a year ago , the economy 's gdp added 0.3 % . 
  on an annual basis , the currency bloc posted a 0.7 % increase on a seasonally adjusted basis , down from the 1.0 % rise recorded in the first three months of the year . 
   however , some positive news came from germany , where industrial output recorded its strongest performance in more than two years . 
  german industrial production rose 1.9 % from the june 's reading of 0.4 % , signalling that europe 's number one economy is headed for a third-quarter rebound . 
  economists , however , had forecasted a climb of 0.5 % .

  people already complain about german influence on the eu 's institutions , but now there 's going to be a fragmented united kingdom , economically stagnant france , recessive italy & weak spain ? 
  and now the strongest economic counter-weight to germany * ( and the one predicted to surpass them economically sometime in around 20 years ) * is about to be hindered & split ? 
  while germany continues to use the euro to undervalue it 's exchange rates so it can boost it 's exports & absorb industries from neighboring eurozone countries ? 
  how is this going to play out any other way ? 
  scotland seceding basically guarantees german hegemony in the eu for the next generation or two , if not more . 
  and the only reason i actually think / u/pablospicyweiner is so fervently supportive of this , but rather quiet & tame on the issue of bavaria & german states becoming eu member-states . 
  how ? 
  the united kingdom is projected to pass germany economically in around twenty years , it has the largest reserves of soft power in the world , it 's a un security council member and with france it 's one of the two major security guranteers & hard power providers for the continent . 
  would separation strengthen bavaria 's position in the world ? 
  brittany 's position in the world ? 
  northern italy 's position in the world ? 
  would scandinavia uniting give scandinavian countries less influence in the world ? 
  keeping my fingers crossed for you , bavaria . 
  no , but seriously , am i the only who thinks that the european union would be a lot more functional & efficient if the german states were member-states of the eu ? 
  would n't that help balance out the continent 's representation and help the institution be more equitable ? 
  a europe of regions ? 
  respect the opinion of somebody who has lived in scotland for more than twenty years & is registered to vote in the referendum , instead of going after them on a personal level just because they plan to vote a certain way ? 
  the opinion of a british citizen who lives in scotland with her family , has resided there for more than 20 years , and whom is registered to vote in the referendum matters as much as that same person 's opinions on ukraine or snowden ? 
  the treaty limits troop numbers , not military spending . 
  germany still does not meet the 2 % of their gdp in military spending as required by nato . 
  the real question is how do you get eastern europe to trust germany in relation to the baltics & nordstream , and how do you get france & britain to trust germany after libya & mali . 
  did the guy not just propose that the united kingdom take on all the debt that helped buy that military hardware ?

   both countries , the most adamant backers of the united nations security council resolution to authorize military action in libya , also pointed to the passage of the measure on thursday as an important -- if rare -- example of european resolve .

   the us appears especially reluctant to engage its military in yet another muslim country , not least because of the disastrous miscalculations that accompanied the invasion of iraq in 2003 . 
  indeed , in a speech last week to the united states military academy at west point , robert gates , the us defence secretary , appeared to rule out any major us military engagement in libya .

  why were their armed forces taking part in the military action , and why had their diplomats done the grunt work in the negotiations that led to adoption of the resolution ?

'', 
  as reuters ' john irish reports , le drian 's statement marks `` the first time a senior french official had suggested that an ` international coalition , ' rather than the united nations , could intervene in syria . '', 
  peculiarly , le drian advocated a `` partial '' no-fly zone instead of a full one , saying that shutting down syria 's entire air space would be tantamount to `` going to war . '',
