  meh , i guess it all comes down to your personal interpretation . 
  the nazis took the swastika though and used it to represent their bullshit heritage , so i do n't think it 's * that bad * that a bunch of non-racist people are taking the confederate flag to represent their actual heritage . 
  ** edit : ** all of that said though it probably should n't be on display , even in a unofficial capacity , by public officials ; no matter their intention . 
  wow , wow , wow . 
  i agree with the sentiment , but america has healthcare access & availability comparable too the vast majority of other first-world countries , including most of the ones in europe . 
  if you get shot in america , you 'll be just as well taken care of as in your average european country . 
  it 's the affording it & going into debt part we have to work on ... but they ca n't deny you access nor are you restricted access nor is that healthcare in itself subpar ... . 
  yes , because the first thing we want to see happen in a new multi-polar world centered on asia , where a rising china is to be our greatest competitor , is to once again divert the majority of our focus & resources * away * from the pacific , and back to europe to bolster a divided european union vulnerable to russian aggression/influence . 
  because , if there 's one thing that will deter china in their territorial disputes with japan & the phillipines , and if there 's one thing that will preserve our relationship with all our other allies in the region , it 'll be by putting them all on the backburner because we 're distracted with something half-way around the world . 
  listen buddy , it 's black * or * asian . 
  could 've been somebody who looks like chris tucker , could 've been somebody who looks like jackie chan . 
  we just do n't know . 
  and how has germany not been trying to keep europe divided for the past millennium ? 
  how was the germanification of the holy roman empire any less divisive than the anglophication of the angevin empire ? 
  how was it not even more divisive by miles ? 
  how was bismark 's balancing act much different than the british balancing act ? 
  and the united kingdom is as european as your own country . 
  you 're not special . 
  you 're not superior . 
  you 're just as european as the british . 
  britain is in the eu , they 've been in the eu , and they 're no more different than germany in that regard . 
  germany is selfish when it comes to fiscal transfers , german policies are helping rip northern & southern europe apart , thus dividing the eu . 
  so you can fuck right off with that elitist special club bullshit . 
  lmao, 
  germany is getting policies to her advantage by draining the industrial lifeblood of her neighboring countries and refusing to help them when they 're on their knees . 
  in fact , germany has been adamant about keeping them on their knees through strong opposition to fiscal transfers while using it 's influence to keep them implementing austerity . 
  that 's not like france or any other country in the eu . 
  that 's just germany right now . 
  ever closer union my dick . 
  lol i ca n't imagine if california or texas tried to pull this shit & sink a huge portion of the country to their own benefit . 
  but than again , we were n't foolish enough to try & implement a currency union without a proper political union and no will for a fiscal union . 
  half-of-me ca n't even blame the british . 
  i just want them to remain in the union to off-set german influence , but i understand their hesitation when watching the continent fail to claw out of stagnation while inching closer to deflation , all while transforming into what 's basically a extension of the german export machine . 
  regardless , germany is still doing much better than the rest of europe by a pretty large margin specifically because of these policies . 
  maybe you 're right though , maybe germany may realize that draining the rest of the eurozone & weakening the south 's recovery is a double-edged sword , and actual reform will be implemented . 
  reform that slows germany growth , but ensures broad growth across the eurozone & bolsters competition against germany . 
  or maybe germany might say fuck that , continue to consolidate the industrial capital of the eurozone within germany , weaken the other eurozone countries * ( specifically france & the south ) * so they ca n't compete with german industry & then move to open the huge russian resource markets which germany will be the only one properly positioned to take advantage of * ( even if it conflicts with the interests & security situation of eastern european or scandinavian eu member-states ) * to off-set any slow-down in growth while taking full advantage of free movement laws to attract immigrants . 
  honestly i think the german elite is aggravated as fuck with america right now specifically because of the latter . 
  by pushing the buttons on ukraine & rallying eu countries to oppose russia over it , it spikes their overall plan , or the very least delays it . 
  although i will admit poland is a wild card . 
  it has the potential to be a very influential nation in the region * ( much more than now ) * and it being outside of the eurozone insulates it from the above to a degree . 
  i 've seen a good many germans actually criticize poland for doing to germany what germany is actively doing to the rest of the eurozone . 
  their disagreements with the german-influenced ostpolitik also threaten german access to russian resource markets , so that 'll be a interesting disagreement to watch in the future . 
  why ? 
  germany has maintained the status quo since the economic crisis began . 
  we 're more than half-a-decade into it & things have n't really changed . 
  an if radical change does n't happen during a crisis , there 's even less chance of it happening during the new * `` normal '' * . 
  and it 's not unwise to expect this trend to continue at all if it 's * specifically designed & influenced too * . 
  we 've already watched what i 've described happen to all of south europe , why would it be any different with france in coming years ? 
  i do n't even expect germany 's general policy on russia to change to be honest . 
  ukraine is just a hiccup . 
  after draining the eurozone and consolidating as much of it 's capital as feasibly possible in germany , the next logical step would be to take advantage of that by opening the absolutely huge resource markets of russia , * ala * nordstream , even if it goes against the interests & security situation of their fellow eastern european eu member-states . 
  it 's economic colonialism at it 's finest . 
  if it was n't for nato & my country 's relationship with europe in it 's entirity being at risk , i would n't even be mad , i 'd be impressed . 
  lol ** edit : ** honestly though , the most hilarious part , at least for me , is that germany was reluctant about joining the euro & france had to pretty much push them into it . 
  france thought the euro would hinder german soft power & contain their influence to the benefit of france , only have the opposite thing happen when germany turned the tables to the determinant of france . 
  beautiful irony that . 
  it does n't matter how populated france is if germany uses the euro to undervalue their exchange rate while opposing any form of fiscal transfers . 
  they 'll drain the industries of france thanks to more competitive exports from a undervalued exchange rate and then hinder france from recovering by forcing the implementation of austerity without the benefit of fiscal transfers . 
  given germany 's better economy , more people will move to germany from france . 
  free movement laws & such . 
  of course she would . 
  the united kingdom leaving solidifies germany 's position as hegemon of the european union . 
  no country will be economically strong enough nor stable enough to oppose them in soft power terms with the uk leaving , not the south , not france . 
  decades of economics that are specifically designed to benefit germany by draining/weakening the rest , and a foreign policy focused on appeasing russia to open it 's resource markets at the determinant of eastern european countries ' * ( in addition to a weak focus on hard power ) * is n't going to surprise me at all . 
   imo it 's pretty ridiculous to think the 2-state solution is a suitable permanent deal . 
  and ... how do you feel about this ideal in relation to the current israel/palestine situation or a theoretically divided great britain ? 
  it looks even crazier when you see pictures of f-22s intercepting them . 
  but it really is n't that weird . 
  we americans still use b-52s and they came out the same year as the tu-95 , although our b-52s are jet-powered . 
  some modern-day b-52 air crews are flying the same type of plane their grandfather could 've flown . 
  although we pretty much replaced them as nuclear bombers with b-2s & b-1s an such , utilizing them mostly as conventional bombers * ( not a much better alternative when you want to drop a fuckton of bombs at one time in one place ) * , unlike russia who i 'm pretty sure still use theirs for nuclear delivery . 
  but than again , we did fly one * ( a b-52 ) * through china 's newly declared aidz * ( we opposed it since it conflicted with japan & korea 's own territorial claims ) * . 
  it 's big , slow & easy to detect * ( and consequently easy to shoot-down ) * , so these types of planes are also good for sounding a clear message when you want too . 
  bah , than my apologies if i got carried away . 
  just had to vent that . 
  and you know what i find most hilarious ? 
  when you imply i 'm a chickenshit coward who does n't care about europe when i 'm adamant about increasing american military presence in eastern europe , defending non-nato eu member-states like finland or sweden and upping aid , both military & civil , to ukraine , as well as advocating intelligence sharing & assistance * ( even if that means cia black ops ) * . 
  a year ago i was called a imperialist warmonger & downvoted for oblivion for saying russia is still a threat to the eu as their eurasian union 's interests would inevitably collide with the eu 's interests in eastern europe . 
  i was called a ignorant fool stuck in the past for believing that nato countries should either increase military spending to 2 % or eu countries should integrate militarily * ( or both ) * . 
  now i 'm called a chickenshit coward & downvoted to oblivion on this subreddit because i do n't want to risk a thermonuclear war by directly confronting russia in a conventional war over a non-nato & non-eu country . 
  and sometimes it 's by * the same god damn people * . 
  ** edit : ** and how was europe * not * the punk here ? 
  how were * we * the punk ? 
  lmao the situation in ukraine was in good part created by europe by waving the potential of eu membership in the ukranian people 's face , but when shit hit the fan , the eu pussied the fuck out , abandoned the ukrainian people & left the burden to america until we could rally you guys back to the defensive . 
  i live right next to a american city that 's home to a very important command center . 
  ** you 're the lucky one . 
  ** you 'll be the one incinerated . 
  dead in minutes before you even know what the fuck happened . 
  i 'll be the one who dies a slow , painful & lingering death as my body slowly disintegrates from radiation poisoning ; first my hair will fall-out , then my teeth & then the slow sickful death with blood leaking out of my orifices . 
  and yes , let me tell you how much i relish this . 
  a weak europe constantly dependent on american hard power to maintain the status quo when the world is shifting to asia & china is our most important rival . 
  a europe incapable of agreeing on a common foreign policy or integrating militarily , one who ca n't implement a proper currency union with the proper underlying fiscal union nor one capable of even deciding if it want 's to be a supranational entity or a intergovernmental organization . 
  so yes , that 's what i want . 
  a divided , weak europe that 's under constant russian threat & incapable of responding to regional security concerns , thus making them more dependent on my country and forcing both our resources & focus away from asia and back to europe . 
  this shit might 've been a benefit in the last century when the world revolved around europe & the soviet union was our greatest rival , but it 's not the cold war anymore . 
  the world revolves around asia now , and china is our greatest rival . 
  the fact we 're still there , the fact we 're willing to risk thermonuclear warfare for small regions like the baltics and for the ideals of european integration , should ring true to how good allies we are . 
  but on that note , let 's not forget about the last century . 
  where our intervention in wwii prevented the iron curtain extending to the channel , where our garrisoning of the fulda gap deterred the soviets from annexing western europe , where the marshall plan helped speed up the post-war recovery of europe & where america 's contribution to nato * ( combined with all the other shit ) * helped provide the stability & foundation needed for pan-european integration to really take off .
