  a pretty decent number of european states accompanied us to afghanistan . 
  an the taliban were protecting , supporting & providing harbor for a group which attacked our military & civilian infrastructure . 
  the invasion of afghanistan was permitted under [ article 51 of the un charter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chapter_vii_of_the_united_nations_charter#article_51 ) & the occupation itself authorized with [ united nations security council resolution 1386 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1386 ) . 
  libya was pushed mainly by europe , with the united states being the reluctant one and syria was supported pretty fervently by france . 
  oh , and how many chemical weapons does assad now have ? 
  and if you remember correctly , this whole thing was started by a eu-offered trade agreement to ukraine that came with the conditions of democratic reform & which threatened to pull ukraine out of russia 's sphere-of-influence and into the eu 's . 
  misread the topic ; my apologies . 
  thought it was talking about the european union . 
  we 're the leader of nato in europe because the rest of nato in europe does n't trust germany . 
  and that 's not a jab at your history , it 's a jab at your military spending and other things , like with france & britain over libya & mali or eastern europe over the baltics & nordstream . 
  the government is n't going to have a choice . 
  same reason those carriers did n't go nuclear , same reason neither of them have any cats & traps and same reason why the royal navy is n't even sure if more than one can be fielded in active service . 
  france is already holding on to a string , and have already had to make significant cuts to their military . 
  [ ** libya , europe and the future of nato : always waiting for the u.s. cavalry ** ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato )  america was visibly reluctant to get involved , let alone lead the action . 
  and , having helped to knock out libya 's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes , it pulled back from the front-line operations . 
  but america 's role remains essential , not least in providing air-to-air refuelling , as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the european allies . 
  [ ** nato commander : eu could not do libya without us ** ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/115650 )  nato major-general marcel druart , addressing the european parliament committee on security and defence on tuesday ( 20 march ) , said nato relied heavily on us military expertise on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) capabilities . 
  [ ** dempsey : france formally asks for u.s. aid in mali ** ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/ )  the french government has formally requested u.s. military assistance to combat al qaeda in the islamic maghreb in mali , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the american forces press service on thursday [ ** french military heads threaten to resign over ` grave ' defence cuts ** ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10852165/french-military-heads-threaten-to-resign-over-grave-defence-cuts.html )  french army , navy and air force chiefs and its joint chief-of-staff threaten to resign over military spending cuts , with jean-yves le drian , defence minister , warning they would render foreign operations impossible [ ** us sending aid to france to fight w. african terrorists ** ] ( http://www.voanews.com/content/us-sending-aid-to-france-to-fight-african-terrorists/2409941.html )  u.s. president barack obama has authorized $ 10 million in military aid to help france fight terrorists in the sahel region of west africa . 
   from his vacation retreat along the atlantic ocean in massachusetts , obama said monday that `` an unforeseen emergency exists '' requiring the assistance for france as it fights against `` violent extremists '' in chad , mali and niger . 
   the funds will be used for airlift and aerial refueling services requested by france . 
  [ ** mod accused of ` bungling ' army cuts ** ] ( http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/politics/mod-accused-of-bungling-army-cuts-1.559768 )  ministers have been accused of putting britain 's military capabilities at risk by `` bungling '' money-saving army reforms . 
   ------------------------------------------------------------  the public accounts committee ( pac ) criticised the ministry of defence ( mod ) for failing to consult the head of the army fully before pushing ahead with deep cuts to regular forces . 
   it also gave little consideration to whether it was possible for reservist numbers to be near-doubled by 2019 , and it managed to squander millions of pounds through a flawed deal with capita . 
   the verdict , delivered in the cross-party committee 's report on the controversial army 2020 programme , comes as nato leaders gather in wales for a key summit . 
   the scheme is intended to save more than # 10 billion over a decade , by cutting 20,000 personnel from the regular army and increasing reservist strength to 30,000 . 
   but the national audit office ( nao ) has suggested that the recruitment target could take six years longer than planned to hit . 
  [ ** can britain meet its nato defense commitments ? 
  ** ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2014/0905/can-britain-meet-its-nato-defense-commitments )  british prime minister cameron says his country is committed to safeguarding eastern europe from russia and investing in its military , but a new study shows britain may fall short of the nato defense-spending guideline of 2 percent of gdp this year . 
  france is economically stagnant , the uk is about to fragment , italy is economically recessive & spain is economically weak . 
  what 's it going to look like in twenty years ? 
  especially as more and more neighboring industries are absorbed by germany because of them using the euro to keep their exchange rate undervalued ? 
  thus boosting their exports ? 
  what 's it going to look like the united kingdom secedes from the eu ? 
  * there will be a less influential united kingdom to help other countries off-set german influence in the european union . 
  * france 's most important partner in the areas of foreign policy & military affairs will be considerably weakened . 
  * one of the lynchin 's of nato will be considerably weakened . 
  * europe , especially eastern europe , will have to rely more on the united states for hard power & security assurances , thus increasing american influence while diverting american resources and focus from the pacific . 
  so your opposition to independent & sovereign german states is that they already have to much power & autonomy ? 
  and you want to eliminate that redundancy by establishing a unitary state which would improve efficiency ? 
  i bet the united kingdom & spain feel the same way about scotland & catalonia respectfully . 
  an do you plan for this new state to be centered on berlin by any chance ? 
  i bet london & madrid like that idea too . 
  it 's the only way the european union is n't going to become a * de facto * extension of the german state . 
  i mean , seriously , people already complain about germany 's influence in eu politics & decision-making , how do you guys think a fragmented united kingdom , economically stagnant france , economically recessive italy & economically weak spain is going to make the situation ? 
  same reason france is quiet about scotland . 
  a weakened united kingdom means less of a counter to german influence and less assistance when it comes to military/security matters . 
  austria is basically is a german state in economic & population terms . 
  i do n't think it 'd be necessary for austria to dissolve , but having comparable german states instead of a huge german hegemon next door would probably give austria more influence in the european union . 
  it was europe which wanted to intervene in mali & libya , and europe which offered a trade treaty with the conditions of democratic reform which brought about this situation in ukraine . 
  i have no problem with scottish sovereignty . 
   only the snp 's plans for the future scottish military which they want to integrate into nato . 
  i mean , if upsetting me is more important than scottish independence , than ... well ... that makes you a pretty shitty nationalist , does n't it ? 
  kinda undermines the sincerity of your own commitment to the cause . 
  yes it does . 
  ignore europe like salmond 's plan for military spending & outfitting . 
  snp wants a small force like austria or ireland . 
  because the european union depends on nato for it 's hard power & security . 
  this was exemplified with libya . 
  if it 's a serious & taxing military operation , even if it 's pushed by eu member-states for eu member-states ' interests , it 's undertaken within nato 's framework , not the eu 's . 
  i mean , look at the baltics . 
  despite having a mdp with the eu just like with nato , it turns to nato , and nato 's framework , for defense . 
  not the eu . 
  even though the eu 's very security & stability is tied into their defense . 
  honesty , the common security & defense policy is , in my opinion , just a easy way to get into nato without actually having to commit to nato . 
  are you going to stop commenting on / r/europe now , like scotland 's military policy ? 
  we are cutting our military spending . 
  and we have been trying to minimize europe 's reliance on us . 
  and if you have n't noticed , russia just abducted a estonian intelligence agent and invaded a country right on nato 's border . 
  russia is n't in the ussr , but they want to grab back what they lost with the ussr . 
  an if you missed it , a number of nato/eu countries are in the soviet union 's former sphere-of-influence . 
  an the world * is * getting more peaceful . 
  that 's what happens when you have a single undisputed world superpower and a stable international framework . 
  we 're seeing that change as we shift into a multipolar world centered on asia , where other great powers are rising , trying to carve out their own spheres-of-influence, 
  yeah , i know , that 's part of the problem . 
  i fully understand it and it 's the reason i have no hope for germany compensating for a weakened united kingdom or being able to step up if we want to lessen our commitment to the continent . 
  so the burden is going to continue to be on us * ( who are trying to shift focus to the pacific ) * , the united kingdom * ( who is going to be weakened ) * & france 's * ( who recently had to make military cuts ) * shoulders . 
   based on the popular vote winner within each of the nation 's mep districts accommodates proportional representation & deters swing-states . 
  i do n't give a fuck about that or what the fuck your country does , i give a fuck about the snp 's military policy and their want to join nato & the eu . 
  become isolationist for all i care , but if you 're trying to do all this other shit than be ready to hear these concerns . 
  an if that bothers you , i do n't ever want to see you make a single comment about america 's foreign policy or what you think american politicians should be doing . 
  what opinion ? 
  i do n't give a fuck what scotland does , it 's their country . 
  but i do give a fuck about having to compensate for europe 's lack of hard power & power projection , which , given france 's military cuts , germany 's continued unwillingness to contribute & the uk 's fragmentation , is going to only get worse as the continent becomes more dependent on us . 
  all while we 're trying to pivot to the pacific to prepare for a rising china , multi-polar world & a * `` asian century '' * . 
  if that 's crazy , than call me gary busey . 
  wow , i hate when people have nothing serious to add to the discussion . 
  are my points wrong though ? 
  contest them , debate them , just do something that stays on topic . 
  and if people ca n't tell there 's different individuals with different opinions in a country than they 're idiots . 
  no , this is about the eu & nato too . 
   the political machine required to fund and run an election requires the sort of compromise which makes individual interest moot on a national level . 
  that 's true of every political system & every politician , no matter the country . 
  merkel in particular . 
  and it 's much easier to understated the american system when you look at them like european coalitions than european parties . 
  i mean , tell me , which party whip do you think has more authority ? 
  one in a parliamentary system or one in america 's system ? 
  did n't we just send a destroyer to the black sea ? 
  and is n't it docked in romania ? 
  an do n't we have a moderately sized military base at one of your airports ? 
  * lol *,
