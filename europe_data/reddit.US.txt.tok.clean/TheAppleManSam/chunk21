  the vast majority of european politics do revolve around party politics and loyalties . 
  hence why the parliamentary-system is considered a party-based system & the american system is considered a individual-based system . 
  we also got interests in the pacific and could honestly give two shits about europe being our main area of focus . 
  there 's a reason they 've called this century the * `` asian cetury '' * . 
  the influence we get from it ; no longer a benefit , now a liability . 
  we stay and help because we 're allies , but we 've been steadily trying to force europe to integrate & increase military spending for awhile now so they stop being so dependent on us . 
  yeah , like join nato without meeting the 2 % of their gdp military spending requirement or joining the eu and then relying on the united states through nato thanks to nato member-states also being covered under the eu 's security & defense policy . 
  how much does romania , a member of nato , spend on it 's military again ?

  [ ** nato commander : eu could not do libya without us ** ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/115650 )  nato major-general marcel druart , addressing the european parliament committee on security and defence on tuesday ( 20 march ) , said nato relied heavily on us military expertise on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) capabilities . 
  [ ** u.s. aiding france 's military operation in mali ** ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563710/ )  * bamako , mali * - france 's foreign minister said sunday that the united states is providing communications and transport help for an international military intervention aimed at wresting mali 's north out of the hands of islamist extremists . 
  oh , yeah , nothing to it . 
  i do n't know why i could n't see that before . 
  thank you . 
   it 's boring being in nato just to follow what usa wants . 
  ** except ** [ ** france and britain lead military push on libya ** ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/world/africa/19europe.html )  paris -- france and britain continued to press their hawkish position on libya on friday , saying they intend to take the lead in enforcing a no-flight zone . 
   both countries , the most adamant backers of the united nations security council resolution to authorize military action in libya , also pointed to the passage of the measure on thursday as an important -- if rare -- example of european resolve . 
  [ ** us reluctant to intervene militarily in libya ** ] ( http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/africa/us-reluctant-to-intervene-militarily-in-libya )  washington / / after a rapid diplomatic response to the violence in libya , the us government 's momentum has ground to a halt over direct military intervention . 
   the us appears especially reluctant to engage its military in yet another muslim country , not least because of the disastrous miscalculations that accompanied the invasion of iraq in 2003 . 
  indeed , in a speech last week to the united states military academy at west point , robert gates , the us defence secretary , appeared to rule out any major us military engagement in libya . 
  [ ** how libya became a french and british war ** ] ( http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2060412,00.html )  as the military action against libya to give teeth to u.n. security council resolution 1973 began , one question kept nagging away : why , precisely , were the governments of britain and france in the lead ? 
  why were their armed forces taking part in the military action , and why had their diplomats done the grunt work in the negotiations that led to adoption of the resolution ? 
  [ ** obama trying to limit military involvement in libya ** ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2011/politics/03/18/obama.no.fly/ )  washington ( cnn ) -- president barack obama is trying to limit the united states ' role in enforcing a no-fly zone over libya to support aircraft only and is very reluctant to commit any offensive u.s. firepower , a senior u.s. official familiar with the military planning discussions said friday .

  [ ** dempsey : france formally asks for u.s. aid in mali ** ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/ )  the french government has formally requested u.s. military assistance to combat al qaeda in the islamic maghreb in mali , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the american forces press service on thursday, 
  we 've been trying . 
  russia & european interventions in mali/libya ar n't exactly helping . 
  so you guys step up your military spending , tell germany to get off it 's ass or actually make a eu military . 
  we 're not going to abandon you , but do n't you get * a lil annoyed * at the huge amount of american influence on the continent because of all this ? 
  because it almost seems like you 're enjoying it . 
  but eh , i guess some people are into that kinda thing . 
  yes , because a moderately-sized country spending well below 2 % on their military , while simultaneously damaging the capabilities of one of europe 's largest & most capable miitaries who actually spends more than 2 % of their gdp on their military , signals no serious changes whats-so-ever . 
  ever heard of germany 's military spending ? 
  or germany 's take on hard power & foreign policy ? 
  is it the will of the scottish people to join the eu & nato ? 
  than this concerns all of us . 
  i mean , i do n't give a fuck which way you go , america will be fine in general , it 's your region that will be worse and us that will have to fucking help maintain the * status quo * . 
  but i guess regional issues that directly concer the eu & nato ar n't something that both you , huh ? 
   unless , that is , the snp does a complete 180 on the military at which point i 'll praise jesus . 
  yet your own country has signed the lancaster house treaties with them , and relied on them the most when it came to joint european hard power/security . 
  yet your own country is the one , who with us & the united kingdom , helps maintain regional stability , security & provide the eu 's hard power . 
  an your own country has had to cut military spending because of economic problems , despite your entire chiefs of staff threatening to resign because of it . 
  so no , the united kingdom facing a reduction in it 's military capabilities wo n't have adverse effects on either of our countries man . 
  dude , the entire continent relies on france , the uk & america as their military lynchpins . 
  france has already had to cut spending below the 2 % line because of economic problems . 
  and now the united kingdom 's military is about to have a serious reduction in it 's capabilities ? 
  the nation behind it is about to fragment ? 
  wonderful , absolutely wonderful . 
  really . 
  have you seen snp 's plans for the scottish military by the way ? 
  great stuff , great stuff . 
  well this is fucking great . 
  now us & france can carry * even more * of europe 's military burden since the united kingdom is about to be considerably weakened . 
  fucking great . 
  really . 
  wonderful . 
  this is exactly what we needed . 
  one of the foundations of european security & hard power fragmenting right when we 're trying to shift focus to the pacific and shift responsibility back onto european shoulders . 
  oh , and all of this on top of france cutting it 's military spending because of economic problems , russia starting shit in eastern europe & north africa not being one of the most stable places in the world at the moment . 
  fucking great . 
  really . 
  amazing . 
  ** edit : ** why the downvotes ? 
  ca n't you see how much i 'm looking forward to this ? 
  how happy i am ? 
  maybe scotland can even be like ireland or austria and not do jack shit for the continent when it comes to helping secure the baltics , helping france in north africa or just helping reassure eu hard power in general . 
  i 'm so looking forward to this guys . 
  no lie . 
  if anything , you guys should be happy . 
  america gets to continue to have heavy influence on the continent for the next half-a-fucking-century while china chips away at our influence in the pacific because we love focusing on europe so much . 
  ** i 'm american . 
  ** i have done my research , i have sat through it and my point still stands . 
  especially since half of what i said was n't even arguing about the source , but the conflict in itself and what you said about it . 
  even a broken clock is right twice a day . 
  stop trying to fucking corner the guy into a fox news watching neocon just because he agrees with the dude on this . 
  for all we know that weaponry could 've stopped the rebel offensive which was supplied , assisted * ( as in , actual russian troops provided a fuckton of the troops , heavy armor & artillary ) * & commanded by russians from taking place in the last month , thus giving putin a fuckton better bargaining position & basically guaranteeing that ukraine is going to share the fate of transnistria or any other country which is incapacitated by a frozen conflict cutting it in two . 
  do you * realize * this ? 
  do you * realize * putin is going to do what ever the fuck he wants in ukraine with the less friction he encounters ? 
  do you * realize * putin has been supplying , training & sending soldiers to help the rebels to cut-up and sow chaos in ukraine , while ukraine is n't receiving any comparable assistance in kind ? 
  do you * realize * that nobody is talking about a american or western military intervention in ukraine against russia and you 're a idiot if you think they are ? 
  do you * realize * your self-righteous mocking attitude is annoying as fuck ? 
   it talked about ever closing union and how does that negate or answer anything i just asked ? 
  is it not talking about a union between the signatory & constituent nations which make-up the european union ? 
  but anyway , it is my opinion , and apparently as a american i have a better understanding of the situation than you . 
  where in the treaty of rome did it say the european union was n't a union of nations ? 
  where in the treaty of rome did it say that the european union was n't a supranational union and instead was a national union in itself meant to replace the constituent nations of the eu ? 
  was the treaty of rome signed by the administrative divisions of european nations or by european nations ? 
  because the united states is a natural ally of the european union and cementing that relationship would have huge global benefits for both parties involved . 
  especially considering the huge say it 'd provide the both of us on the international scene . 
  why do they have to leave nato ? 
  why ca n't the eu itself just join nato and replace them ? 
  switzerland is still a representative democracy . 
  they also has half the population of the netherlands with just as big of a economy . 
  and they are isolationists who do n't like to get involved in foreign affairs . 
  them scrapping those eu treaties is n't something that should be ignored either in this context .
