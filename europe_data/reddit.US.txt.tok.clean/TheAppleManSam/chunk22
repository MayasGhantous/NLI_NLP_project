  an you want to compare that to a supranational organization with a population of 503 million & a economy larger than the united states ? 
  one whom is a union of * nations * , not * states * ? 
  one whom is in it 's formative years ? 
  one whom is going to have to involve itself heavily in international affairs ? 
  i would assume to join a * supranational * one . 
  you know ; a union of nations . 
   one of the core tenants of the eu , if not the core tenant . 
  take that away , you give the eu a lot more authority , but also take away one of it 's underlying foundations . 
  others might think they can do the union better , and without nations , it takes away part of the eu 's legitimacy & identity . 
  so the federal government would become much more powerful , but i think there 's a chance it could also become more unstable in a way * ( there 's already talks of splitting the eurozone between north & south , the european union in two with one half concerned with those in the eurozone & one half with those out of it , along with the occasional flair up about secession in general as we see with ukip or to a lesser degree with france 's front national ) * . 
  but than again , maybe not . 
  mob rule is not something i 'd advocate anywhere . 
  maybe . 
  or maybe it might provide the impetus for the south or scandinavia to secede and form their own union . 
  * give the european parliament the right to initiative for legislation . 
  strip the european commission of legislative initiative and solidify the separation of powers between the executive & legislative branches . 
  * replace the council with a european senate as the upper house of the eu legislature , with two senators from every member-state that serves for 10 years , with the two senators being divided into two classes , so each nation would have a senatorial election every 5 years by popular vote * ( that would also coincide with the ep elections ) * . 
  * the commission president to be elected by a electoral college , with each nation holding a popular vote and the electoral votes being distributed based on the popular vote winner within each of the nation 's mep districts ; an the nationwide popular vote winner receiving two additional electoral votes to coincide with their amount of senators . 
  * have one commissioner per department * ( which themselves should be reduced to clear out redundancy ) * instead of one from every nation with a portfolio to compensate their position ; have commissioners appointed by the commission president and confirmed by the european senate . 
  although that 's only for it being more democratic while still maintaining a federal structure . 
  given the supranational nature of the european union however , i might suggest that any senators of the proposed european senate still be appointed/confirmed by national legislatures , or nominated/appointed by national leaders . 
  i 'm sorry dude , but i just ca n't see the european union surviving a national front-led france . 
  or at least the european union as we know it today . 
  it 'll roll the union back to it 's earliest days . 
  unless , that is , the party & le pen do a complete 180 on their existing policy towards the european union . 
  so this is how the european union ends . 
  not with a bang , but with a pen . 
  yes , but that carrier is usually the biggest ship in the taskforce & probably the one who needs the most in the way of resupply , so helping reduce that should go a decent way in helping reduce the overall logistical burden of the entire taskforce . 
  so , yes , in my opinion , 1 nuclear carrier with a number of conventional escorts has a decently smaller logistical footprint than 1 conventional carrier with that same number of escorts . 
  i might 've mischaracterized the situation before with the * `` much smaller '' * logistical footprint comment , but i do n't know the exact specifics so i ca n't say , although * i do know * the less fuel you need , the more food you have & the less targets * ( resupply ships ) * you give the enemy is not something you should underestimate in a conflict . 
  yes . 
  even if you have a equal number of escorts & a equal amount of planes as a conventional aircraft carrier , you still need less fuel . 
  plus with a nuclear reactor you have more space for cargo , thus more space for consumables . 
  ^ ^ ^ than ^ ^ ^ whats ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ point ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ building ^ ^ ^ it ? 
  ^ ^ ^ no , ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ seriously , ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ good ^ ^ ^ reference ^ ^ ^ point ^ ^ ^ regardless . 
  also a much larger logistical footprint , which i would wager is a even bigger concern during a conflict than gas price .

  i had edited my post just before you replied , but i pointed out that [ brazil fields a conventional aircraft carrier using catobar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brazilian_aircraft_carrier_s%c3%a3o_paulo ) that 's a [ old cold war-era french design ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clemenceau-class_aircraft_carrier ) . 
  i do n't know enough about the queen elizabeth 's design to judge on what * kind * of system they were planning , but the steam-powered version in itself has been used before & proven on conventional aircraft carriers . 
  ** edit : ** in addition , emals is being fielded on the [ gerald ford-class aircraft carrier ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerald_r._ford-class_aircraft_carrier ) , and that was designed at a time coinciding with the queen elizabeth . 
  i know , 
  opinions on the f-35 aside , stovl aircraft are always going to be inferior to catobar aircraft . 
  if those carriers had gotten some cats & traps you guys would 've been able to field the more capable f-35c or any other future alternative , but now you 're stuck with either designing a stovl from the ground-up , going with the f-35b or reviving the harrier . 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's just not true . 
  in fact , brazil operates a conventional carrier outfitted with catobar * ( a old french one no less ) * . 
  i mean , even after it was a decided & done deal that the ship was n't going to be nuclear , catobar was still on the table until 2012 . 
  works great at first ... but ... i do n't think it worked out too well for the turkish leadership at the end of the day last time around ... . 
  swiss neutrality is actually based around military preparedness . 
  they 've cut down on military spending a good little bit since the end of the cold war , but the military in itself is still a pretty important factor , hence the conscription and doctrine . 
  also why switzerland has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world . 
  capable of carrying 40-50 aircraft to the nimitz 's 85-90 . 
  that 's not why . 
  it 's because westminister was looking for ways to save money . 
  same reason they did n't install catobar ; even though it would 've meant being able to employ the more versatile & capable f-35c instead of the f-35b . 
  and i must remind you ; we are not a colonial empire who 's going to lose it 's colonies & we 're not the soviet union where the federal government will implode & disintegrate . 
  you seem to read history , but not understand history . 
  we are moving into a multipolar world and there is no denying this , but that does not mean we will cease to exist nor we will collapse into ourselves . 
  that 's ignorant of the situation and the situation around us . 
  to not preserve the influence we have , to not build upon the advantages we have now as a superpower , will leave us wholefully unprepared for a multipolar world centered on asia , where we 're going to need that influence most , where as a great power we 'll need that foundation most . 
  and once again , i must remind you , we are not a colonial empire which will lose it 's colonies nor are we the soviet union where the federal government will disintegrate . 
  even with the end of the american hegemony , * we will remain a great power * , and not only a great power , but for the next century , probably the most influential & leading great power . 
  we are not the british empire . 
  we are not a european colonial empire . 
  we will not lose texas like the british lost india , we will not lose new york like the french lost algeria & we will not lost florida like the dutch lost indonesia . 
  we will not shrink down to a area a little bigger than washington state with a economy & population closer to california than a leading economic power . 
  nor are we going to disintegrate like the soviet union . 
  we might not be a superpower forever , but * we will remain a great power * , and almost guaranteed to be the leading one for the next century , even in a multipolar world centered on asia . 
  accept that . 
  some of the greatest infrastructure/social expansions/projects in this nation 's history happened as america began truly exerting itself on the global stage . 
  one of the reasons we possess the international reserve currency is because of our commitments to nations around the globe . 
  one of the reasons europe has integrated to the degree it has is because we began truly exerting ourself on the international stage . 
  this era has been one of the most peaceful in human history if you look at the facts & statistics . 
  i mean shit , do you think the american economy would really be as influential & dynamic as it is today without our global influence ? 
  because you 're wrong if you do . 
  so we can do both and we will do both . 
  we will improve this nation at home and we will not cease to a influential actor on the world stage . 
  i refuse to support you or anybody else who think we should become isolationists and retreat from the world , who thinks we should not involve ourselves in international affairs or deny ourselves the responsibilities and benefits of a superpower & great power . 
  and like i said , you 're in the minority . 
  recognize that and accept it . 
  do n't push your view like it 's common opinion or a official stance because it 's not & it wo n't be . 
  is china is a violent , conquering state because of it 's wars in korea , tibet , vietnam & india * ( or it 's border disputes with the soviet union ) * ? 
  because of the uncountable number of wars it 's had in it 's history ? 
  because of it 's territorial disputes with a large amount of it 's neighbors in the south china sea ? 
  nobody 's glorifying it , but many people are recognizing it as necessary . 
  and i 'm not talking about the united states coming to * `` save the day '' * , but you 're deluded if you deny the huge part the united states plays in europe 's defense through nato , especially in regards to the baltics & power projection . 
  all war is grim & horrible , but some wars are necessary . 
  this would be a necessary one . 
  to not only protect our european allies from outside aggression , to not only uphold our obligations to nato , to not only maintain a stable & prosperous europe , but to maintain america 's influence & hegemony in the world as well . 
  like i said , stop pushing your political soapbox of isolationism . 
  it 's not what the majority believes in , it 's not what the united states government advocates & it 's not how we 're going to act . 
  deal with that . 
  do n't replace reality with your own version of it . 
   ** tallinn , estonia ( cbs news/cbsdc/ap ) ** -- president barack obama proclaimed an unwavering and permanent u.s. commitment to the security of its nato allies , as he mounted a show of solidarity wednesday with european nations anxious about russia 's aggression in ukraine . 
   during a visit to estonia , obama also announced the u.s. would send more air force units and aircraft to the baltics , and called estonia 's amari air base an ideal location to base those forces . 
   standing shoulder to shoulder with estonian president toomas hendrik ilves , obama ticked through a list of u.s. military resources already at work in the region , and said the u.s. has a duty under the nato charter to the alliance 's collective defense . 
  he 's american . 
  dude , what the hell is with you acting like we wo n't defend our allies ? 
  especially in the context of the fulda gap ? 
  we honor our commitments .
