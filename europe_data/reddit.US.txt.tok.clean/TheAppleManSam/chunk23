  what the hell is with you acting like america does n't value it 's global influence & hegemony ? 
  underpinned by things like nato & our security commitments to countries like japan , south korea , the phillipines & australia ? 
  what the hell is with you acting like i , a american just like you , would want that to disappear ? 
  why the hell would you act like i , as a american , would want no response to be given to allies being invaded & our soldiers being killed in a offensive invasion ? 
  why would i , as a american , want russia to expand & grow stronger at the expense of the european union & our baltic allies ? 
  you do n't speak for all of us , so stop acting like you do . 
  you 're in the minority . 
  every election since the great depression has proven that , fdr & up . 
  the vast majority of americans do n't want to become isolationist & say fuck the world , so stop acting like we do . 
  why is this even to be doubted ? 
  if we do n't defend them , our commitments to london , berlin & paris are called into question & the nato alliance falls apart . 
  american commitments to japan , australia , south korea & the philippines falls apart . 
  a huge part of america 's international influence & global hegemony collapses overnight . 
  we 're not going to let that happen . 
  the last thing we want is for that to happen . 
  not to mention it would also mean russia expanding & growing stronger , and at the expense of our european allies no less . 
  an realpolitik aside , the dead american soldiers & the fact these are tiny nations are being bullied by a bigger one would garner huge moral support from the american people for such a scenario , probably more-so than for the other countries . 
  military support is one of the few things we can do to actually influence them & keep them on somewhat of a leash . 
  and i 'm suspicious of germany 's motives for cancelling that , especially in relation to american pressure . 
  for context , we were pretty pissed that germany started selling the saudis large weapon orders in the first place , because the way we had it set-up was that the sauds could n't go to war for more than 6 months or so without having to buy more ammo & shit from us , but than germany started selling them shit , which pissed us off because it weakened their dependence on us , and thus , our influence over them . 
  yes , but that 's in the context of * decades * . 
  we still have a lot of time to go until then . 
  well , for one , the swedish government is n't collaborating with iran on mass surveillance & receiving a fuckton of information from them in return . 
  i mean ... because ... . sweden * has been * instituting it 's own mass surveillance programs ... * ala * the fra law & titan traffic database . 
  so ... you know ... there 's that ... 
  are you under the impression that sweden is n't backed by the us & nato ? 
  * lol *, 
   as could we . 
  unless we 're willing to stay for * decades * , with all the collateral damage * ( dead women & children ... the left loves that ) * & friendly casualties * ( dead soldiers in a middle eastern country from ieds ... the right loves that ) * that comes with occupying a purported holy land populated by religious conservatives , i do n't think we could . 
  well ... that 's not true ... we might be able to even if we 're not willing to do the above & commit long-term ... by propping up somebody like saddam or assad ... whom are * also * genocidal authoritarian dickheads willing to shed blood like water ... and whom at the end of the day , thanks to oppressive & brutal tactics ... tend to divide the country & drive the population into the hands religious extremists ... as we saw with iran & isis ... . 
  which ... kinda just puts us back at square one ... does n't it ? 
  alright , than what 's the fix ? 
  invade the land of mecca & medina ? 
  embargo the largest oil producer in the world & most influential member of opec ? 
  replace the authoritarian monarchy with liberal human rights-loving democrats ? 
  because , in reference to the likely alternatives , which is crazy fundamentalists committed to jihad against the west , i 'll take the * slightly * less crazy kleptocratic royals whom are committed to making money with the west . 
  unless it 's total war , done brutally , i do n't think many people can take out the sauds . 
  they produce the most oil , they 're the most influential voice on opec & they hold down a fuckton more groups that are slightly more crazier than they are , and worse , are committed to crusade against the west . 
  i do n't think many countries want to see oil prices skyrocket because of a economic embargo , or the idea of their troops , whom are western & mostly christian , being tasked with occupying the land of mecca & medina ... . that 's filled with a bunch of people that would be sympathetic to crazy shit like isis . 
  because ... if that occupation fails in the long-run ... * lol * ... 
  ** i think it 's good for sweden . 
  ** small non-threatening sweden relatively isolated from those regions . 
  ** but , lol , not for a country like mine . 
  ** saudi arabia is the largest producer of oil in the world , it 's the most influential member of opec & all the alternatives to them ar n't really attractive . 
  the 70s saw a oil embargo which brought the western world 's economy to it 's knees . 
  the past decade showed what can happen when you move to oust brutal authoritarian leaders in the middle east , no matter how genocidal or blood-thirsty they are . 
  so ... i mean ... what should we do ? 
  embargo saudi arabia & pit opec against us ? 
  watch as oil prices skyrocket & our economies get battered , especially when we 're still recovering from the great recession ? 
  occupy the land of medina & mecca with western troops whom are mostly christian ? 
  * lol * even when we were * invited by the saudis themselves when they were under direct threat of invasion from saddam * it infuriated a huge number of people in the middle east , being one of the primary reasons for al-qaeda 's rise . 
  and israel ... what do we do there ? 
  i will never ideologically support a country which has a ethnic-based foundation * ( even if it 's kurdistan ) * , but ... practically speaking ... they 're the most western-styled & aligned countries in the middle east , as well as being one of the most democratic & liberal . 
  they 're military & intelligence services are , for all intents & purposes , the most competant & cooperative ones we got in the region to work with . 
  hamas is shit , assad is shit & hezbollah hates us . 
  the fears of israel turning into a rhodesia 2.0 , if not worse , is very real * ( everytime israel or palestine get a nelson mandela or mlk-type figure they seem to die off rather quickly for one reason or another ) * . 
  hell , our * `` close allies '' * in the region , turkey & jordan , have populations that fucking hate us * ( the only thing keeping the relationship alive is the deep state & monarchy respectfully ) * . 
  and their governments ar n't much better than israel to be honest . 
  the gulf states are just fucking horrible , and pakistan is barely holding shit together . 
  i mean , hell , with egypt , there looked like their might be a democratic-aligned chance with the muslim brotherhood , but than they got couped & sisi is still bitchy we supported their election & criticized his coup , so he 's flirting with the russians & doing other little shit , causing us to rev-up the military/development aid pipeline again because the suez canal & egypt 's relationship with israel are so god damn important , pretty much bringing up back to step one , where only a couple years ago everybody lambasted us for supporting mubarak . 
  so , you know , in short , fuck the middle east . 
  ** tl ; dr saudi arabia 's oil is to valuable & israel 's pre-disposition to the west is too important . 
  but somebody needs to look pass that for morality 's sake , and by all means , you go get them sweden **, 
  if you can influence saudi , you can influence opec , and if you can influence opec , you can stop a foreign organization from launching a oil embargo that brings your very economy to it 's knees * ala * the 70s . 
  i mean , sure , you can * try * to invade saudi & occupy them , but * lol * , good luck with that whole * `` western christian soldiers occupying the land of mecca & medina '' * thing while also throwing a huge monkey wrench into the world 's most important oil supply . 
  except for ... you know ... the british pushing us into libya . 
  and say what you want about syria , but we did n't bomb assad & we got him to forfeit his chemical weapons . 
  i do n't think that would 've been possible without the threat of force . 
  and on top of that we 're helping assad right now by bombing isis & having top officials floating the possibility of future dialogue with him . 
  francafrique  chinafrique  caliphafrique, 
  even if you ignore the moral angle of dead americans & a close ally under attack by russia , all of which in itself would enrage the american public , you got ta look at the realpolitik perspective as well . 
  if we do n't move to decisively protect poland & uphold article v , every other similiar agreement we have in the world is trashed , from anzus to south korea to the philippines to japan . 
  any potential future agreements of the like would be trashed . 
  we 'd alienate the european union & a number of our other closest allies . 
  trade deals would go down the drain or hit a wall given the distrust & alienation . 
  our military power projection in general would be shattered . 
  countries would be less willing to work & cooperate with us militarily because they would no longer trust us militarily or look at us as weak . 
  the same would apply to any intelligence agreements/sharing . 
  in all aspects , whether talking morally or realpolitik , it 's against our interests to not help . 
   it 's not in the us 's interests for nato to dissolve though . 
  it would destroy every other similiar agreement we have in the world , from japan to anzus to south korea , not to mention any potential security alliance with your own country like modi suggested , no matter how potentially loose it may be . 
  and on top of that it 'd pretty much make us fangless & a black sheep in general when it comes to global affairs . 
  it 's really hard to project power or negotiate important trade treaties after you 've alienated a huge part of the globe & sowed distrust with the rest . 
   ridiculously , almost cartoonishly evil , like a literal supervillain . 
  you must not be very familiar with my main man stalin . 
  lol now imagine if he arrested a competent & loyal general on bullshit charges , exiled his family , tortured him * ( like pulling teeth out & smashing toes with a hammer torture ) * , pretended to kill him with mock firing squad demonstrations & then * sent him back to work * afterwards like nothing happened . 
  some of them probably did at least entertain the possibility . 
  hell , with all the money & manpower they poured into the maginot line , it 's almost impossible to argue they did n't . 
  lol an even during versailles the negotiating parties pretty much predicted the next generation 's road-map . 
  president wilson wanted relatively tame treaty terms so germans would n't feel too vengeful & vulnerable to extremism . 
  ferdinand foch wanted absolutely crushing treaty terms so germany would have absolutely no hope of ever being able to rearm & field a sizable army to wage war again given how much of a threat such would pose to france . 
  so , they made a compromise right in the middle that not only made germany vengeful & vulnerable to extremism , but also preserved it 's rearming/mobilization capabilities . 
  the best of both worlds so-to-speak . 
  lol an as you might 've heard before , ferdinand foch predicted that versailles was but a 20-year truce . 
  which proved to be pretty much correct at the end of the day . 
  so everybody got something right about the end results of the treaty during it 's drafting ... more or less ... 
   but get throttled to 218kbps for netflix because your cable provider only supports canal + 's streaming service ? 
  i think you just answered your own question . 
  a even playing field means a even playing field for us corporations & silicon valley as well . 
  and for the times when you ca n't * politically * be too protectionist in this regard , you have to become practical with it .
