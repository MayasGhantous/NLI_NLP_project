  he wanted american soldiers to remain under the condition they be subject to iraqi courts , the same ones he had a hand in corrupting & increasing sectarian strife in , so he can suck my american balls for that . 
  american troops will remain , thankfully , in afghanistan however . 
  and it 's * because of * american hard-power that china is n't going to make a move on japan , korea or the philippines . 
  our commitments to those countries have been made quite clear in the past couple years , and it 's obvious from our recent * `` pivot to the pacific '' * that we 're serous about them , else we would n't be moving 60 % of both our air force & navy into the region . 
  i do n't quite understand what you 're saying , sorry . 
  do you mean to imply russia would use this to justify a invasion of nato countries ? 
  in which case no , i 'd say they could n't . 
  russia is n't stupid . 
  they 'll start a war with ukraine , but they would hesitate & think for a very long time before committing any action against a nato member-state . 
  america would beat them decisively in a conventional war . 
  the only hope russia could ever have of gaining nato territory is if they launched a lightening assault on the baltics , dug-in , and kept it limited to the baltics by forcing a stalemate with tactical nukes before nato could really mobilize , with the very real threat of escalating to icbms . 
  but that 's all but impossible . 
  america has the largest reserves of expeditionary forces & the most efficient means of power projection in the world , so any russian offensive would result in a immediate american response which would completely fuck up any chance of it being a quick or limited conflict . 
  american tactical nukes in theatre , especially in both germany & your own country , also give russia pause to think before using tactical nukes . 
  same reason chinese military doctrine is now focusing on power projection directed towards limited , short & decisive wars , because they too ca n't hope to compete with america & it 's allies conventionally in the pacific . 
  i also would n't be surprised if vietnam became their ukraine . 
  a more interesting question is countries like finland , ones whom are in the eu , but not nato . 
  but even though i do n't think we * ( america ) * would hesitate to get involved and defend them as to not would risk our relationship & influence way to much with the other nato members in the eu . 
  ** disclaimer : ** all my unofficial armchair opinions . 
  i do n't think it 's wrong to say they did when they requested nato membership . 
  i 'd actually support a nato intervention if it was n't for the nuclear weapons involved . 
  i mean , think about it . 
  to appease putin would be setting a precedent of justified invasions & annexations in europe , of * de facto * allowing russia to annex countries which consider eu membership to shore up their eurasian union . 
  it 'd signify a weak european union , once unable to defend it 's interests & potential allies when faced with russian aggression . 
  it 's also the difference between wanting ukraine to end up like poland or finland instead of kazakhstan or belarus . 
  of course since we have nuclear weapons on the table none of that matters . 
  all we can hope to do is give ukraine diplomatic support & under-the-table help . 
  people seem to forget that though . 
  people forget that nuclear weapons are real , that nuclear holocaust is horrible , and that russia is n't the soviet union . 
  they are weak , a shell of their former self desperatly clawing at the sovet union 's former glory while being encroached on two sides by rising super powers * ( to the east china & to the west the european union ) * . 
  russia is a bear backed into the corner . 
  there is no doubt they will lose a conventional war with nato . 
  and despite what people may think , i can almost gurantee that the russian leadership recognizes this , and i 'm almost positive that * they will * use tactical nukes in east ukraine if we get involved , and i 'm damn well positive we * ( america ) * will respond in kind with our own tactical nukes , until it eventually escalates into full-blown strategic nuclear warfare with icbms or de-escalates with large chunks of ukraine being a radioactive wasteland . 
  i think we should be giving more support , funding & equipment , even training , to the ukrainian government , as well as covert support , such as intelligence sharing & even black ops by covert special forces , but a straight-up conventional war & overt intervention is n't going to do any good for anybody , no matter what side of the fence you sit on . 
  and that 's just the reality , in my opinion , which many people do n't want to acknowledge . 
  it does n't matter what we want , and it 's not that we do n't want to help , but it does matter that we 've taken the leadership role a number of times during this crisis . 
  our wants are irrelevant , what matters is what we 've done . 
  it 's us who have been one of the countries pushing hardest for economic sanctions . 
  it 's us who moved quickly to use our soft power & diplomatic support to help the ukrainian government at the beginning of the crisis . 
  it 's our stick which eu hardpower is in large part reliant on . 
  europe 's carrot of possible eu membership might 've helped create this crisis , but it 's americans who have had the leadership role forced on us a number of times because of eu incompetence & divisions in your membership . 
  people wonder why nuland said * `` fuck the eu '' * , but it 's because the eu basically helped create this whole thing by wanting to expand east , but when the shit hit the fan the eu collapsed into itself thanks to member-states ' diverging interests leaving the burden on america 's shoulders . 
  if the eu , even finland , is attacked , america is going to war because to not would risk our relationship with our other nato & eu members * ( which annoys me to a certain degree since countries can basically use the eu to get american protection while ignoring nato commitments ) * . 
  if the eu invades ukraine & gets involved in a nuclear war , it 's going to be america carrying the brunt of the nuclear war since france & britain 's nuclear policy is basically a stop-gap to trigger a american response/reinforcement . 
  you 're right in your implication however , the eu does need to integrate militarily & adopt a common foreign policy , but do n't act as if we do n't want too help . 
  we do . 
  it 's just there 's a very big difference of helping as a ally & carrying most the burden as a leader . 
  conventional war with the russians makes the use of tactical nukes very possible & severely increases the chance of global thermonuclear warfare . 
  i 'm already willing to lose my hair & piss blood for the baltics , but let 's not keep moving the goal posts , especially when [ russia considers limited nuclear strikes to be * `` de-escalation '' * ] ( http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation ) . 
  so i have no doubts that once nato troops begin to route the russians from east ukraine & look like they have a clear path for the russian border , putin wo n't need to think very hard about hitting our armies with a tactical nuke or two to cover the russian retreat & freeze the conflict . 
  than america will probably respond with a tactical nuke or two , and then so on & so on until we 're all living through a nuclear holocaust or somebody decided to give in & de-escalate before the icbms get launched . 
  i do however think we should be giving more funding , equipment & weapons to ukraine , not to mention offering training if we can through nato border countries & sharing as much intelligence about russian forces as we can with them . 
  would n't mind some special forces or cia sad teams conducting black ops in ukraine to help the ukrainian government either . 
  ** edit : ** an i 'm not just saying this for myself * ( although ... i 'd be lying if that did n't have a large part to play ) * . 
  the first country to suffer decent sized chunks of it being turned into radioactive wastelands is going to be ukraine , the first people to suffer atomic incineration & the slow death of radiation poisoning is going to be ukrainians , and they might be the only ones if de-escalation happens afterwards * ( we are talking about nuclear warfare here guys , so it 's not just individual countries at risk , it 's the entire world ) * , making any potential war not that beneficial for anybody involved . 
  ** edit2 : ** all of that said however , the only way i could see a nato intervention in ukraine not resulting in nuclear war is if we stop at the border of east ukraine & come to a agreement with russia to divide the country , with west ukraine being allowed to join the eu & east ukraine going to putin 's eurasian union . 
  of course that would kill any hope of ukraine staying together or re-uniting from anywhere to half-a-century to a century , if not more , but meh , there ar n't many good options . 
  it 's either that or helping from the sidelines in the hope ukraine can throw out russia themselves and keep the country together . 
  not really ... probably more like grozny or sarajevo ... . but i get what you 're going for ... . 
  clearly . 
  as a capitalist i find the nonsense spouted by many about the soviet union 's downfall as insulting.the cause is not even mentioned once by the vast majority of these people . 
  why are they afraid to say communism ? 
   there is limit on how much you can spend . 
  sarkozy and his party ( ump ) are in trouble with the law right now as they overpspent last elections and made fake bills about it . 
  i think this could actually support my point . 
  agreed . 
  an on a related note , i honestly think without lobbying , only rich people who could really afford to run wide-reaching campaigns . 
  the same logic follows in in my mind for politicians being paid appropriate sums that can provide them a decent living . 
  otherwise , in my opinion , only rich people would really be attracted to the position since they 'd be the only ones who could probably live comfortably low-paying political office ; not to mention i think it helps deter bribes . 
  and in the same spirit of what you 're saying , there should definitely be responsible money caps on campaign donations so shit does n't get ridiculous . 
  this is my main problem with superpacs here in the united states . 
  lobbying has always been around , but they basically injected fucking steroids into it , and blurred the money trail ... which makes the whole point of lobbying being allowed because of transparency seem redundant ... i mean there 's still a clear money trail ... but it 's layered over several more times & made harder to get too ... . an i know this is slightly off-topic , but on the note of money in politics , far as that tea party thing in virginia that i mentioned goes , it gots me emotionally confused to be honest . 
  on one hand , i like to see the little guy win & money in politics overcome by the popular will , but on the other hand , i fucking hate the tea party & fear that their victory will make the superpac supporters say that the superpacs are n't as harmful as people make them out to be ... which is crazy ... because they 're harmful as fuck to our democratic process & only the stupid or willfully ignorant will refuse to acknowledge that ... . 
  it comes down to one thing : ** money ** whether you like it or not . 
  money makes the world go around . 
  how do you reach people ? 
  with good advertising . 
  good advertising costs money . 
  thus running elections cost money . 
  hence why you 're more willing to listen to the mom throwing you benjamins than the one throwing words . 
  even if you take out lobbying , all this stuff costs money . 
  the issues have ' t gone away , but neither has the need for money . 
  both are still existent . 
  only you 're driving one underground & blurring the lines to your own disadvantage . 
  how is this politician running such a wide-reaching campaign ? 
  how is this politician able to afford to reserve all these convention floors , get so many tv spots & arrange transportation for his staff , not to mention provide their salaries ? 
  with lobbying you can look at a piece of paper and see , oh , fuckwad is taking money for dickwad ; but without it , you do n't know who 's influencing fuckwad . 
  poor people get protests & civil disobedience . 
  rich people get lobbying . 
  sometimes poor people find rich people that support or agree with their political causes and get them to lobby for them , only they call it charity . 
  it 's fucked up , but at the same time it 's the way of the world . 
  that said * money does n't equal victory * . 
  you only have to look at how the tea party ousted the republican congressman eric cantor in virginia despite only raising a fraction of as much money as him , and despite him being house majority leader * ( 2nd most powerful guy in our lower house atm ) * . 
   any post related to the talks are immediately swarmed by american shills like / u/savannajeff who is ** australian ** . 
  and what about / u/taenk who i 've seen post in support of the ttip before ? 
  is he not really german , but actually a american shill disguised as a german ? 
  i mean ... are europeans & non-americans who do n't share the exact same opinion as you american shills ? 
  fucking pathetic dude . 
  ignore domestic & international divides and just blame it on the foreign boogeyman because you have no other recourse but to admit that it 's not only amerikkkunts who support certain things you dislike . 
  i always viewed lobbying as a way to keep money in politics transparent instead of forcing it underground and not knowing from where or to whom it goes .
