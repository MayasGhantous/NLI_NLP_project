  the lesser evil and all that if you want to play devil 's advocate . 
  hence why we have * representative democracies * to negate that to a degree . 
  upper houses also help balance it out * ( when they actually have the power & influence to check the lower house that is ) * . 
  oh my god you just blew my mind in how i visualize mercantilism . 
  i mean i always understood what it was , but that context really helps put it in perspective . 
  something related i pointed out in another thread : [ ** nord stream ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream#security_and_military_aspects )  swedish military experts and several politicians , including former minister for defence mikael odenberg , have stated that the pipeline can cause a security policy problem for sweden . 
  according to odenberg , the pipeline motivates russian navy presence in swedish economic zone and the russians can use this for military intelligence should they want to . 
   --------------------------------------------------------  more political concerns were raised when vladimir putin stated that the ecological safety of the pipeline project will be ensured by using the baltic fleet of the russian navy . 
  german weekly stern has reported that the fibre optic cable and repeater stations along the pipeline could theoretically also be used for espionage .

  best ones are the * `` non-us '' * threads , where somebody says something stupid , they automatically assume it 's a american , and then when they find out it 's not a american the whole comment section is still about how stupid americans are . 
  he also united germany & managed to keep the balance of power in europe * ( to germany 's advantage ) * through relatively short * ( but decisive ) * wars . 
  of course the system he had set-up took a man as competent as bismark from coming crashing down ... and unluckily for germany ... they did n't get a man as competent as bismark after him . 
  actually , [ most of what we produce is actually crude oil * ( 8.8 m barrels out of 11.5 m barrels ) * ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/us-bid-oil-supremacy-shakes-crude-market-150340650.html ) , and overall [ we surpass saudi arabia in production when you include the natural gas liquids * ( which is what brings us up to 11.5 m ) * ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-04/u-s-seen-as-biggest-oil-producer-after-overtaking-saudi.html ) . 
  well ... that 's not good ... . . 
  we could begin serious exports of oil * now * if [ the government would allow it ] ( http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/09/20/with-production-booming-pressure-builds-allow-exports-crude-oil/f1kklsk7jbmtlwuolivpdl/story.html ) . 
  we already produce more crude oil , 8.8 million barrels-per-day , than we import , which is about 7 million barrels-per-day . 
  not to mention we 're a [ net oil-product exporter ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-29/u-s-was-net-oil-product-exporter-in-2011.html ) , exporting more gasoline , diesel and other fuels than we import * ( refineries & such , especially in relation to oil from canada ) * . 
  cracks are already beginning to show in the 40-year-old ban though , with some [ pretty notable exceptions ] ( http://online.wsj.com/articles/oil-shipment-cracks-decades-old-ban-1406762293 ) being granted on a case-by-case basis . 
  it 's probably only a matter of time now before the floodgates break & the entire ban in itself is repealed . 
  although yeah , [ we 're projected to be a net exporter of oil by 2020 ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2014/02/28/u-s-will-meet-energy-demands-by-2020-citi-researcher/ ) . 
   russia , for example , needs about $ 90 per barrel to finance its spending . 
  [ $ 100-per-barrel ] ( http://blogs.barrons.com/emergingmarketsdaily/2014/09/23/russia-budget-needs-100-oil/ ) actually . 
  poor , poor impoverished norway . 
  i do n't think it 's so much that the third-one does n't matter as it is that we feel we can weather it better than iran or russia can weather their problems . 
  i suspect if this really starts to make a dent here we 'll put the screws to saudi arabia . 
  if there 's one benefit to having a relationship like we do with a country like saudi arabia it 's that we can avoid things like this getting out-of-hand . 
  i do n't think american leadership has forgotten nor forgiven the 1970s opec embargo , nor do i think we 'll tolerate a repeat * ( at least in the sense of oil being used as a weapon against us ) * . 
  it is , but the united states * ( in my opinion ) * is tolerating it for now because we judge it 's effect on russia * ( as a bargaining chip with ukraine ) * & iran * ( as a bargaining chip with those high-level nuclear talks ) * outweighs it 's negative effect on us . 
  at least for now that is . 
  i suspect if the cons begin to outweigh the pros we 'll begin flexing our diplomatic muscles & tightening the screws . 
  the saudis have actually [ hinted the opposite ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/13/us-oil-saudi-policy-iduskcn0i201y20141013 ) ; with them indicating that they 'd comfortable with much lower oil prices * ( below $ 90-a-barrel , if not near $ 80-a-barrel ) * for at least a year or two . 
  nah , it 's pretty well accepted * ( and admitted ) * that saudi arabia is the one behind the price decrease by increasing production . 
  it 's suspected that saudi arabia is flooding the market with cheap oil to curtail shale oil extraction in the united states & canada to preserve their market share * ( hinder profitability there , delay the inevitable increase in production ) * if anybody is the spectator here it 's the united states . 
  although i feel we 'll flex our diplomatic muscle once we think it 's negative effect on us outweighs it 's negative effects on russia , iran & venezuela . 
  saudi arabia is flooding the market with oil to * hinder * the united states in shale oil extraction so they can preserve their market shale . 
  the united states , in my opinion , is merely allowing it for the time being because we figure it 'll hurt russia , iran & venezuela in the short-term more than it 'll hurt us in the long-term . 
  eh , i think there 's three europes , and one france . 
  ** europe a ( * outside eurozone * ) ** doing good . 
  ** europe b ( * northern eurozone countries * ) ** doing alright to the determinant of southern eurozone countries . 
  ** europe c ( * southern eurozone countries * ) ** in the shitter . 
  ** france ( * france * ) ** between europe b & c , but steadily , and surely , drifting further towards europe c. 
  i find germany to be one of the worse offenders of this . 
  hence why their poverty rate is the same , if not a little worse , than the united states . 
  half the jobs they 've added have been part-time jobs , and many of those are mini-jobs that are socially insured . 
  half of the full-time jobs they 've added are actually low-paying temporary assignments as well . 
   similarities between the euro region and japan are intensifying , heaping pressure on mario draghi while offering good news for bond holders . 
   sluggish credit growth ? 
  check . 
  slowing economy ? 
  check . 
  falling market expectations for inflation ? 
  check . 
  yes , it has that too , placing europe in a similar situation to what was encountered by the world 's third-largest economy after the bubble burst on its postwar economic miracle . 
   --------------------------------------------------------------  with the official interest rate near zero , bond investors say european central bank president draghi may need to do more to steer the region away from the deflation and debt traps that condemned japan to two decades of stagnation . 
   ------------------------------------------------------------------  europe should be on a roll . 
  it 's never been cheaper for euro-area governments or individuals to borrow money and the ecb is seeking to put cash into the economy through cheap loans to banks and a pledge to buy asset-backed securities . 
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ** bund yields **  the rate on benchmark german bunds was 0.96 percent as of 2:19 p.m. london time and touched a record 0.866 percent last month . 
  spanish yields fell to 2.039 percent earlier this month , from 7.751 percent just before draghi boosted confidence in the region with a pledge in july 2012 to do * `` whatever it takes '' * to save the euro . 
  this month , the ecb lowered the main interest rate to 0.05 percent . 
  officials are forecast to keep the rate unchanged in their next policy decision on oct. 2 . 
   yet there is little evidence any benefits are feeding through to the economy . 
   euro-area growth stagnated in the second quarter and data today showed inflation slowed to 0.3 percent this month , a fraction of the ecb 's goal of just under 2 percent . 
  the central bank 's preferred measure of medium-term inflation expectations is near a four-year low . 
   ------------------------------------------------------------  ** declining costs **  although declining costs for everything from transport and food to clothes can be good news for consumers , disinflation -- or slowing inflation -- makes it harder for borrowers to pay off debts and for businesses to boost profits . 
  under deflation , or falling prices , households may postpone purchases and companies may delay investment and hiring as demand for their products dries up . 
   ------------------------------------------------------------------  ** bubble burst **  since japan 's real estate and stock market bubble burst in the early 1990s , companies have focused on cutting debt and shifting manufacturing overseas . 
  wages stagnated and consumers reined in spending . 
  that led to two decades with no nominal growth in the economy . 
  prices of goods kept falling , creating deflation that sapped optimism . 
   euro-region inflation expectations , as measured by five-year consumer-price swaps , have fallen and stayed below those of japan since march this year . 
  m3 money supply , a broad measure of liquidity , grew 2 percent in august . 
  that 's less than half the average of 5 percent in the past 10 years , and below the 4 percent threshold that characterized the japanese deflation experience in the past two decades , according to jpmorgan . 
   adding to the mix of constrained credit conditions , a high level of debt and low growth in europe , a fifth of german , italian , and greek people are older than 65 , up from around 15 percent in 1991 , according to the u.s. census bureau . 
  japan has the biggest proportion of older people , with those over 65 accounting for 25 percent of its population . 
   shifting demographics mean more consumers in these countries will no longer be producers , placing further headwinds on growth . 
  it looks like you 're right & fixed . 
   thanks . 
  i think any conflict with japan or the philippines is as likely as russian aggression against a nato or eu member , but i can definitely see vietnam being china 's ukraine * ( especially since they 've been increasing ties with america , but have no mdp with us ) * . 
  i agree with increasing economic ties with china however , but we * ( america ) * must keep the stick ready . 
  soft power working in conjecture with hard power . 
  i do n't really see any reason why europe should or should n't increase economic ties with china though , if only because the eu is n't tied down with alliances & significant interests in the pacific like we are . 
  and unlike russia , china * will * eventually be our equal , and even surpass us in certain areas in the coming century . 
  and unlike russia , they 'll actually have the power & influence to be entitled too it . 
   china is no threat to the eu or the us i disagree heavily with this . 
  i mean i agree that china is no threat * to the eu * , but like with russia & nato , my country has mutual defense pacts with japan , the philippines & south korea , all of whom have territorial disputes or maritime disputes with china . 
  issues which , at least in the case of japan & the philippines , china has n't shied away from & has been willing to wave it 's stick over . 
  first strikes * ( in the sense you 're talking about ) * involve icbms , but we 're only talking about tactical nukes . 
   [ russia actually refers to limited nuclear strikes as * `` de-escalation '' * ] ( http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation ) . 
  russia abandoned it 's * `` no first use '' * policy with the fall of the soviet union & when the west 's conventional capabilities surpassed theirs . 
  not that diabolical though * ( in a defensive context ) * . 
  the west had the same policy in practice through-out the cold war & only began to ease up on it when our qualitative edge managed to balance out the soviet 's quantitative factor * ( although i 'm not even sure we fully realized it until the gulf war when the su was on it 's last breaths ) * . 
  probably why the soviets never really seriously considered a offensive against western europe through-out the cold war , despite being superior in most ways conventionally & having almost-assured victory . 
  tactical nukes ar n't icbms , so in my opinion they 're more than a statement & more likely to be used . 
  for example , in the event of a nato intervention into ukraine , they can be used to cover a russian retreat , or in the event of a russian invasion of the baltics , used to * ( potentially ) * force a stalemate . 
  the thing about tactical nukes , for better or worse , is that it 's not mutually assured destruction from the get-go like with icbms . 
  when they 're most likely to be used is in limited circumstances contained to the battlefield , giving everybody a lot of time to think before escalating into mutually assured destruction * ( if it does n't escalate immediately ... one russian tactical nuke responded too with one american tactical nuke can snowball pretty quickly ... but still slower than jumping straight to icbms ) * .
