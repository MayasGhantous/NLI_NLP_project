  ** edit : ** as for my second point about the baltics , it 's one of the reasons why i think power projection is so critical in our age . 
  you need to be ready to respond , fight & win battles before tactical nukes are even able to be used effectively , and you can only do that with adequate power projection . 
  and if russia actually invades the baltics , you have to accept that they 're probably ready to use tactical nukes . 
  the same logic goes for my country when it comes to china 's territorial disputes with japan & the philippines in the south china sea , and why china has been so adamant about stressing * `` quick , limited & decisive wars '' * in their strategic doctrine since they ca n't win a drawn-out or expanded conventional war with the united states * ( thus why so much depends on short , limited conventional wars & fast responses before the nukes get pulled out ) * . 
  the thing about tactical nukes though , is it 's no so much about their numbers as it is their immediate availability , which is why forward-deployment is so important with them . 
  you 're not going to launch a huge wave of tactical nukes like you would icbms , as there 's no point , since that 's the whole point of icbms . 
  you would however use them on a case-by-case basis limited to the battlefield with the hopes of avoiding the escalation into icbms & strategic nuclear warfare in general . 
  i would n't say they 're more effective * per se * , just potentially more * useful * . 
  because while a single icbm is almost guaranteed to result in immediate escalation to full nuclear war & mutual annihilation , there 's a chance a tactical nuke might not . 
  for example , if russia is losing a battle conventionally , and if the stakes are high enough , they might send off a tactical nuke limited to the battlefield itself to bring about a stalemate or at least cover a retreat to save their forces from complete annihilation . 
  well that or their opponent responds with their own tactical nukes * ( the potential of which can also act as a deterrent in itself ) * , and russia responds back , and then so on & so on until the icbms are launched and we 're all facing nuclear holocaust . 
  but even then , the time period to de-escalate or stop full strategic nuclear warfare is still better than if you launched a icbm right off the bat . 
  this becomes even more obvious * ( and a little worrying ) * when you realize [ russia actually refers to limited nuclear strikes as * `` de-escalation '' * ] ( http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation ), 
  which is why the usd is strengthening , right ? 
   and the euro is on the verge of deflation ? 
  and the rubble is tumbling ? 
  also , we 've made a number of painful spending cuts as well . 
  we just did n't do it exclusively & we waited until the economy had some stability before we did so . 
  an like i pointed out , american infrastructure & public works are comparable to european nations even despite our quantitative easing . 
   ** also : ** you 're irish , not ukrainian . 
  you 've admitted this multiple times . 
  you do n't live in ukraine . 
  all you use that flag for is so people think your opinion carries a little more weight when you suck putin 's cock . 
  it 's just as fucked up as if i put on a scottish flag and started railing against independence , or if i used a catalonian flag to fiercely stress the importance of spanish integrity . 
   russia is moving tactical nuclear weapons systems into recently-annexed crimea while the obama administration is backing informal talks aimed at cutting u.s. tactical nuclear deployments in europe . 
   three senior house republican leaders wrote to president obama two weeks ago warning that moscow will deploy nuclear missiles and bombers armed with long-range air launched cruise missiles into occupied ukrainian territory . 
   -----------------------------------------------------------------  in a related development , the obama administration is funding non-official arms control talks with russia through a washington think-tank that are aimed at curbing u.s. tactical nuclear arms in europe . 
   the first round of talks was held in vienna monday and tuesday . 
   critics say obama administration arms control officials at the state department and pentagon are using the informal nuclear talks as groundwork for future tactical nuclear arms cuts . 
   such cuts are likely to be opposed by nato allies , especially in eastern europe , worried by growing russian military threats to the continent . 
   regarding the nuclear deployments to crimea , senate armed services committee ranking member james inhofe * ( r. , okla. ) * first disclosed last month that putin had announced in august his approval of deploying nuclear-capable iskander-m short-range missiles along with tu-22 nuclear-capable bombers in crimea , located on the black sea . 
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  in their sept. 23 letter to the president , mckeon , rep. mike rogers * ( r. , ala. ) * , chairman of the subcommittee on strategic forces , and rep. michael turner * ( r. , ohio ) * , chairman of the subcommittee on tactical air and land forces , noted russia 's violation of the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty by building a banned cruise missile . 
  the missile has been identified by u.s. officials as the r-500 . 
   the lawmakers said the russian nuclear deployment in crimea represents the * `` clear , and perhaps irrevocable tearing '' * of the 1997 agreement between nato and russia that allowed russia to maintain a military presence within the alliance . 
   the russian nuclear deployment plans and treaty violation should have been discussed during the recent nato summit in wales but were not , they said . 
   as a result , the congressmen urged the president to brief congress on the threatening russian nuclear deployments in crimea . 
  they also called on the president to suspend the nato-russia accord and demand the removal of all russian military personnel from nato facilities . 
   additionally , they asked that the united states and its allies halt all arms control surveillance flights by russia carried out under the open skies treaty . 
   significantly , the three house leaders called on the administration to begin research and development on deployment sites for new u.s. intermediate-range ground-launched cruise and ballistic missiles , if russian refuses to return to compliance with the inf accord . 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------  the action * `` further undermines russian credibility in terms of the budapest memorandum that the russian federation signed in 1994 , '' * the congressmen said . 
   the memorandum promised ukraine would have security assurances against threats or use of force in exchange for kiev giving up its soviet-era nuclear weapons -- at the time the third largest arsenal in the world . 
   ---------------------------------------------------------------  a russian defense ministry spokesman told state-run interfax on march 26 that a * `` missile-carrying regiment '' * of tu-22 backfire nuclear bombers will be deployed to the crimean airbase at gvardeyskoye within two years . 
   ihs jane 's defence weekly described the nuclear-capable tu-22s to be based in crimea as * `` the backbone of soviet naval strike units during the cold war . '' *  rogers , the strategic forces subcommittee chairman , said sept. 18 that the russians have discussed * `` plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in crimea . '' *, 
   ** asian stocks and wall street suffered their worst day of the year after weak german trade data fueled concerns that europe is sliding into recession . 
  european shares also opened significantly down on friday . 
  **  germany reported thursday the biggest monthly plunge in exports in five years . 
  the data came hot on the heels of a string of dismal data from germany in recent weeks that has fed anxieties about recession in the eurozone . 
   wall street stocks slumped 2 percent on thursday and japan 's nikkei share average also skidded 1.5 percent on friday on the news . 
  european shares opened down in early trading on friday , with germany 's dax index sinking to a near one-year low . 
   --------------------------------------------------------  with finance ministers and global investors pinning their hopes on europe 's largest economy and powerhouse lifting the eu trading bloc out of the doldrums , the data sent the markets running . 
   ** brussels ** - germany is on the brink of recession after recording its weakest export levels for five years . 
   data published by the federal statistics office on thursday * ( 9 october ) * indicated that exports slumped by 5.8 percent between july and august , the sharpest monthly fall since 2009 , at the height of the financial crisis . 
   imports also fell by 1.3 percent , suggesting that german consumers are also losing faith in the country 's economy . 
   in a statement , the statistics office blamed late-falling summer vacations in some german regions and the ukraine crisis for the fall in exports and imports . 
   ---------------------------------------------------------  according to eurostat , the eu 's data office , germany 's output fell by 0.2 percent between april and june , after expanding by 0.8 percent in the first three months of 2014 . 
   on thursday , four of the country 's top economic institutes urged chancellor angela merkel to increase public spending in a bid to stoke the economic engine . 
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------  the eu commission , along with us treasury secretary jack lew and numerous eu counterparts , continue to urge germany to shift its focus from trade surpluses , arguing that increasing public investment and wage levels would stimulate demand and higher growth across the bloc . 
   as the eurozone 's powerhouse , the effect of a german recession would be felt across the bloc . 
   economic growth across the 18 countries using the single currency was flat in the second quarter and the bloc is likely to record anaemic growth rates this year . 
  * first off : * [ ** our infrastructure is comparable to all other developed nations , and even better than a number of them . 
  ** ] ( http://lpi.worldbank.org/international/global/2014?sort=asc&amp;order=infrastructure ) not to mention we have the most expansive infrastructure network in the world , and would be better compared to the european union as a whole than any individual european country . 
  * second off * [ ** our poverty level is the same as germany , if not a .1 % lower , and smaller than belgium , estonia , spain & greece . 
  ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_percentage_of_population_living_in_poverty#countries ) and [ ** we 're lower than the european union as a whole ** ] ( http://www.inequalitywatch.eu/spip.php?article99 ) . 
  * third off * : the united states is the one who responded to the great recession with quantitative easing , and it was europe who responded with strict austerity . 
  i do n't even need a source for this . 
  ** holy fuck . 
  ** you 're telling me that rich people invest in think-tanks , investment funds , charity groups & media ? 
  by god , we better outlaw think-tanks , nationalize investment funds , take away any incentives to donate to charity & make sure all media is state-sponsored . 
  it just amazes me people actually upvote somebody implying that the united states is practicing strict austerity & europe is doing the complete opposite . 
  like fuck ... do people literally just replace reality with their own version of it ? 
  you know america has done the exact opposite of europe in relation to the great recession , right ? 
  we have growth & economic stability because we implemented quantitative easing instead of forcing austerity . 
  yet ... you 're criticizing austerity ... and criticizing the united states approach ... and than criticizing austerity ... and then saying that europe should n't be like the united states & should n't implement austerity ... even though america is the one implementing quantitative easing & europe is the one implementing austerity ... can ... can you explain your logic ? 
  because at first glance it seems fucking retarded . 
  lol also , [ look at the actual infrastructure ratings from the world bank ] ( http://lpi.worldbank.org/international/global/2014?sort=asc&amp;order=infrastructure ) . 
  we 're at number # 9 overall and our infrastructure in itself * ( not including all the surrounding variables which brings us down to # 9 ) * is comparable to many other european countries , even better in a number of cases . 
  not to mention the united states has the largest national infrastructure network by a pretty considerable stretch and is better compared to the european union as a whole than any individual european country . 
  and according to the cia world factbook , [ a number of developed european countries have a higher poverty rate than the united states ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_percentage_of_population_living_in_poverty#countries ) , such as germany * ( might be the exact same as us now because other sources give it .1 % lower at 15.1 % which is the same as us ) * , belgium , estonia , spain , greece & slovakia . 
  hopefully you did n't get hurt in the cross-fire from our roving gun battles , let alone beat down & robbed by our oppressive police state because you talked funny . 
  if you did you probably would 've never got proper healthcare because they would 've denied you at the hospital if your credit card did n't clear . 
  do n't trust the food either , the pink slime could give you mad cow disease or the corn rampant tumors because of our horrid regulations & gm crops .

  what was it about then ? 
  no failed big business schemes in the new world which failed miserably & brought on nation-wide financial difficulties ? 
  you can still be married . 
  i 'm not suggesting the abolishment or repression of religion . 
  yes , but in the case of islam & mormonism , people could have multiple marriages , but one civil partnership with all the benefits it entails , without people getting in trouble for polygamy . 
  or polygamy could just be legalized . 
  i do n't know . 
  lol, 
  eh , personally i think no marriage should be recognized by the state and only * `` civil partnerships '' * should be , both for gay & straight . 
  marriage should be a purely religious affair . 
  separation of church & state an all that . 
  although i still believe civil partnerships & families should get tax breaks and other such benefits . 
  although i support gay marriage from a practical perspective . 
   no reduction in state power vs corporations ( i.e. 
  isds ) especially true in relation to airbus . 
  i do n't want to see them suing the united states government over subsidies to boeing anymore than i want to see boeing suing the eu over subsidies to airbus . 
  nor do i want to see things like [ daimler suing the french government ] ( http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/sb10001424127887323610704578630001505477288 ) to prevent them from banning certain mercedes models because they use a banned coolant system that germany thinks should n't be banned . 
   no increase in the strength of copyright yeah , go compare germany to the united states on this & get back to me .
