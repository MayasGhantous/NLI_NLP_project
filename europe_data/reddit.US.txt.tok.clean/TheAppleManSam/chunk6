  if anybody should be worried about increased copyright restrictions & related punishments it should be us in america , not the other way around . 
  because you 've admitted it multiple times , and you even admitted it when i confronted you a week or two ago about it . 
  i 've res-tagged you as a irishmen who has never been or lived in ukraine ever since the first confession . 
  and it has a lot to do with the topic , as you 're misrepresenting yourself . 
  i 'd be a cunt deserving to be called out if i pretended i 'm scottish and railed against scottish independence . 
  i 'd be a cunt if i pretended i 'm german and gave fierce support to the ttip . 
  i 'd be a cunt if i pretended i 'm catalan and fully supported spanish integrity as it is . 
  and who needs ad hominem when people can just [ look at your posting history ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/right_in-the-pussy?sort=controversial ) . 
  people also think they 're ukrainian when they 've never been there & are actually irish . 
  i 'm surprised you 've taken a break from sucking putin 's cock . 
  quite . 
  oh , so you took a conversation discussing a possible ebola pandemic , misrepresented it , and spun it to be about something else ? 
  that something else being domestic american politics that have nothing to do with the conversation at hand and is n't in relation to europe ? 
  yes , misplaced phony indignation . 
  lol, 
  so you 're telling me if you get shot or come down with ebola you 're going to not be able to get care in the united states ? 
  you 're telling me that the united states does n't offer a comparable level of emergency healthcare as europe ? 
  you 're telling me that the european union is leagues ahead in capability when it comes to quarantining a ebola epidemic in comparison to the united states ? 
  because that 's so stupidly wrong it 's funny . 
  i mean i agree a hundred fucking percent shit needs to change and healthcare needs to be made more affordable , but we 're talking about pandemics & emergency healthcare here . 
  you misrepresent & spin bullshit to a disgusting degree . 
  and you turn every conversation here into domestic american politics . 
  * every conversation . 
  * you do n't care about europeans , you just want a stupid fucking soapbox to vent about american politics . 
  lol your neck-bearded superiority complex & dizzying political spin makes me ... well ... it makes me dislike you immensely as a person . 
  i do n't want to talk to you anymore . 
  your attitude is annoying , your personality is repugnant . 
  an you 're probably arrogant enough to take that as a compliment . 
  lol, 
  ** there was no chance of single-payer healthcare . 
  ** how fucking hard is this too understand ? 
  * i support a single-payer healthcare system . 
  * but it was n't going to happen . 
  the republicans opposed it more than they oppose obamacare 's current incarnation . 
  you might not realize this , but despite whatever views me & you might hold , they are not the views held by everybody else . 
  that is one of the main points of democratic politics , that is one the main points of representative democracy , to compromise with people who disagree with you . 
  the only fucking way we were getting a single-payer system was if the president was replaced by a dictator who undermined democracy for the greater good , and as appealing as that might sound to a wanna-be neckbeard julius caesar , it goes against damn near every one of our modern-day ideals & is a clear road for tyrannical oppression . 
  i also think it 's retarded to oppose such a compromise that improves the situation to a certain extent because you have hopes of one-day getting everything you want , even if it risks burning down everything around you in the pursuit of it . 
  people admire ted cruz for that attribute , for side-lining compromise to hold strong to his beliefs , but i call it fucking retarded and a recipe for disaster . 
  the republicans were n't going to go for single-payer . 
  simple as fucking that . 
  there was no way practical way it was going to happen . 
  we had to make a compromise , and i 'm happy with this compromise as i believe it 's much better than the previous status quo . 
  an even now the republicans are fighting tooth-and-fucking-nail to get obamacare repealed . 
  switzerland has a very similiar model & they have one of the best healthcare systems in the world . 
  my mother did n't have healthcare for more than a decade before obamacare . 
  and now she does . 
  that 's all the fuck i need to know . 
  the billions of dollars in federal grants for medicaid expansions , which my cunt state still have n't taken , are on the table & can be accepted at any time to expand coverage state-wide . 
  and that 's all i need to know in reference to the federal government 's commitment to my state 's people . 
  for my mother 's sake , and for others in my state 's sake , i much prefer how the federal government has approached this than pre-obamacare when the only god damn person in my family that had constant uninterrupted coverage was my dad through his job . 
  ** edit : ** you remind me of a liberal ted cruz . 
  a sorta all-or-nothing guy willing to drive us off a fucking cliff & let the world burn down around you if you do n't get * exactly * what you want * exactly * when you want it . 
  * access * to emergency healthcare is just as wide-spread & available as it is in europe . 
  but anyway , it amazes me that you 've made it your mission to come to / r/europe , say fuck-all about european politics or events , and just hijack every discussion to be about domestic american politics . 
  i mean for fucks sake , we have * the rest of reddit * for that bullshit . 
  because the united states , unlike the eurozone , has a strong fiscal union to compensate . 
  we all shared the same mother country * ( britain ) * & common language * ( english ) * at first . 
  we murdered , assimilated & displaced the indians along with their own nations . 
  texas & california had large hispanic populations , but they were displaced by white american settlers in demographics thanks to wide-spread immigration * ( heh ) * . 
  alaska & hawaii shared the same fate , local population overwhelmed by american immigrants . 
  although most people still identified with their state before their nation . 
  this did n't really change until the civil war , and a historical anecdote i 've always heard is that before the civil war the country was referred to as * `` these united states '' * & afterwards it was therefore called * `` the united states '' * . 
  always took that as symbolizing a transformation from a collective identity to a single one . 
  interestingly though , before the first world war , german was our most wide-spread second language , with entire communities talking & teaching it as a first language . 
  this changed after & between the wars however . 
  you guys kinda did it ass backwards though . 
  you abandoned a uniting national identity & language for your states with the dissolution of the roman empire and only tried to unite into a single entity many decades after you fought two huge world wars that divided you . 
  ** edit : ** although we are on the verge of making puerto rico a state despite them being a spanish-speaking territory that 's majority hispanic after [ they voted for statehood in a referendum . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puerto_rican_status_referendum,_2012 ), 
  really ? 
  financial difficulties & run-away big business had nothing to do with scotland joining the uk after requiring a more secure economic safety net ? 
  honestly i think it 's absolutely useless if it does n't apply exclusively to eu member-states . 
  you at least have a chance of enforcing rulings against eu members , but no chance of doing so against russia & turkey . 
  and if you ca n't do so against russia & turkey , you ca n't expect the eu member-states to accept your rulings if other echr members get a free pass . 
  you realize a large number of other eu nations are involved in iraq too as well , right ? 
  and you realize that the eu has forced painful austerity cuts on eurozone members as well , right ? 
  did ... did salmond 's plan involve never seeking membership in the eu & nato as well ? 
  conjuring a magical currency out of thin air without proper foreign reserves or curtailing spending to build up those reserves ? 
  getting all the opt-outs that the uk got despite no recent precedent for new eu applicants ? 
  like how russia & turkey keep company in the echr ? 
  it says something about neoliberalism that powerful and successful nations like the ones in the united kingdom have to unify in order to fight big business . 
  but with the eu 's single market , it looks like we 've just bowed down . 
  i care about estonia :(, 
  easy , you leave the bases , occupy bavaria & use your soldiers to force a totally not rigged referendum on it 's annexation into the united states . 
  and that would be completely legitimate . 
  at least that 's the retarded logic i 've heard in relation to crimea . 
  that it was n't really a invasion because ukraine allowed russia to have bases there . 
  ** translation : ** * `` live in the moment bitch '' * i do n't think that 's so much him not thinking history was shaped by individuals as it is him saying it 's more important to be flexible & take advantage of current events instead of trying to make a rigid , unchanging long-term plan . 
  the monarchy does not only exist in life officially . 
  these are people . 
  and just like other people they 're ambitious & have their own vision for the world . 
  being a blue blood does not make you any less predisposed to human nature . 
  and as is the case with both britain & the netherlands , both of those governments have frequent meetings with their respective monarch . 
  and i 'm not trying to mean or anything either , but the reality of these things is that the same logic you use to oppose the united states joining as a whole is the same logic i use to oppose canada joining the european union . 
  realpolitik . 
  an in the same way you think america should join the eu on a state-by-state basis , i think america , mexico & canada should combine on a state-by-state basis . 
  also , as far as monarchs go , you still entrench a family in the upper crust of your society & give them frequent meetings with the highest officials of your government . 
  that 's a position that can be taken advantage of significantly to manipulate things behind the scenes while maintaining a public facade , no different than corporate lobbying in my opinion . 
   i ca n't see why it should possibly alienate the us .
