  although i agree russia would more than likely hit us with tactical nukes if we invaded russia proper * ( or even east ukraine ) * . 
  and that would probably easily escalate into icbms & strategic nukes in general . 
  but i highly doubt that 's the case with the baltics . 
  any war there would probably , in my opinion , be short , limited & conventional , hence the importance of power projection and being able to respond quickly to situations with your military . 
  same type of environment the united states & china are squaring off in in relation to those disputed territories in the south china sea . 
  no , you 're not . 
  hence why you 're in nato , eu & afghanistan while switzerland is n't . 
  why ... why do you think switzerland has avoided the eu ? 
  it could 've forsaked nato and still joined like ireland & austria , but it did n't . 
  i do n't think many people want to be constricted to the choice of escalating directly into nuclear warfare because you have no other conventional option . 
  there 's no take-backs after you launch a icbm . 
  a limited war that can re-take the baltics conventionally would be completely off-the-table without the proper power projection and your only option would be nuclear strikes . 
  i mean , there 's still a good chance the other will still lead to nuclear war , but any chance that such can be delayed or prevented by winning a battle conventionally should be taken . 
  not that impressive when you actually look at their actions & reactions . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  lol america never claimed it was attacked by saddam . 
  america never tried to invoke article v in relation to iraq . 
  they did n't dispute anything , because there was nothing to dispute in that regard . 
  yes , do n't criticize me on my points , criticize me on my nationality . 
  do n't look at me as a person with a opinion , disregard my opinion entirely because i 'm american & mock me for being american . 
  you 're just as disgusting as those people who stereotype & mock russians simply because of their nationality . 
  lol you 're right , but meh . 
  shit could 've been so much different if the archduke was n't assassinated & he had time to implement his * `` united states of greater austria '' * idea . 
  once again , not cheap . 
  an actually more expensive than the alternative . 
  he is not totally mad because of military deterrence . 
  one you remove the military deterrence it goes from crazy to plausible , from unthinkable to possible . 
  dropping out of nato does n't eliminate the security & defense policy of the eu . 
  eastern europe does n't trust you because of your low military spending , france & the united kingdom do n't believe they can rely on you because of your low military spending . 
  yes , nobody blamed anyone for doing too little in relation to the balkans , rwanda & nazi aggression . 
  i remember that quite clearly . 
  well you got [ britain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_great_britain#united_kingdom_of_great_britain_and_ireland_.281801.e2.80.931922.29 ) at ** 95 ** . 
  and you got [ france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_france#napoleonic_france ) which has a pretty big bag , and whom has also intervened [ ** 30 times in africa ** ] ( http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20100714-1960-2010-50-ans-interventions-militaires-francaises-afrique/ ) since * 1960 * . 
  plus your own country might not have the same number of wars started , but it sure hell wins in body count for the wars * it did start * . 
  do you plan to leave the eu too ? 
  or too just ignore the common security & defense policy ? 
  also , it takes a lot of money to project your military across the globe for the scenarios you 're presenting , and even more money when you do n't prepare to do so like you 're implying * ( aka case-by-case basis ) * . 
  no , i get it , increased military spending with * clearly * make you try to re-conquer europe , subject your neighbors & institute a neo-german empire . 
  you 've made this obvious . 
  rwanda , ethnic cleansing in the balkans , islamic extremists taking over mali , the threat of a aggressive russia , none are suitable excuses for when it comes to the very german threat of a reconstituted 4th reich . 
  i do n't know how i 've never seen this before . 
  clearly the germans ca n't be trusted . 
  thank you friend . 
  no it does n't . 
  lol, 
   which is bad news for our neighbors . 
  you know ... many germans usually complain * ( quite rightly ) * about people constantly shoving the war in their face & calling them nazis ... but here you are ... implying that within every german there 's a nazi screaming get out ... 
  yeah , neville chamberlain is viewed pretty favorably & nobody complained when nobody did anything over rwanda . 
  i mean , i do n't even remember anybody criticizing the dutch over srebrinca or europe in general over the balkans . 
  eastern europe seems pretty content with most the other eu members ' commitments to them . 
  an , by the way , you remember when switzerland joined the eu ? 
  and you plan to project power to defend the baltics/scandinavia , provide humanitarian interventions & secure trade routes with a shoe-string budget ? 
  i. . . i do n't think you quite understand how this works ... 
   and started the most wars in the ** last two centuries ** . 
  like the napoleonic wars , wwi , wwii , crimean war , franco-prussian war , all the wars the british & french empires fought , the latin american wars of independence , etc. 
   if you got a strong military , eventually , you would use it , and the last time we did we left four years of brutal war on everyone 's front door . 
  so you 're telling me that if you increase military spending , you 're going to turn into a nazi , start slaughtering jews & try to annex all of europe ? 
  like a werewolf reacts to a full-moon ? 
  either that 's a shitty implication or germans are just really shitty people . 
  you choose . 
  since you agreed to join the eu & nato . 
  you ca n't be in a military alliance , increasingly integrated supranational entity * and * still act like switzerland . 
  many people believe * ( and believed , as was the case with archduke ferdinand & many of his advisers ) * that the hapsburg empire collapsed because they devolved into a dual monarchy that concentrated power between the germans and hungarians * ( who together accounted for about 44 % of the total population ) * to the alienation of everyone else instead of federalizing into something like a [ united states of greater austria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_of_greater_austria ) . 
  sadly archduke ferdinand was assassinated before any part of that idea could be realized . 
  if that had happened though , i think our history , and maps , would be * very * different from what they are today . 
  as it would 've probably led to a prolonged first world war thanks to a stronger & more assertive hapsburg state * ( an possibly even the central powers winning ) * , or possibly no first world war at all * ( or more than likely just delayed it ) * if it could diffuse tensions in the balkans to a degree ... not to mention it would 've been harder for hitler to just walk in & annex austria with a huge united & influential state to resist such a move . 
  anyway , i 'm getting off-topic , as it 's different with spain , as in this scenario it 'd almost be like going in reverse . 
  going from a relatively federal-like state * ( in comparison to other unitary countries that is ) * to a dual-state to the determinant of everybody else in spain who 's not catalonia . 
  although i guess , if spain really wanted , they could try that route in the same spirit of china with it 's whole * `` one country , two systems '' * set-up in relation to hong kong . 
  but they 'd probably hit the same road-block china is hitting ... in that they 're afraid if they give in to hong kong it 'll set-off a domino effect with china 's coastal regions . 
  personally though i think spain , and the united kingdom as well , should just federalize . 
  spain is already half-way there anyway . 
  luckily we do n't have some the largest fresh water reserves on the planet and luckily we ar n't friendly & decently integrated neighbors with the country that has * the * largest freshwater reserves on the planet * ( and only 30 million people themselves ) * . 
  i 'm also glad the united states is n't one of the wealthiest & most economically dynamic countries on the planet right now ... because you know ... no chance of ever being able to afford desalination plants ... 
  if by better treatment you mean fair representation in the central government 's legislature & constitutionally guaranteed autonomy , than yeah , that 's exactly what i 'm saying in relation to these cases . 
  the colonies would n't of revolted if britain had given them the rights they deserved & i have no regrets about the union crushing the confederacy to keep america together . 
  these are nations , and that should be recognized . 
  just because your local county , town or commune wants to secede does n't mean they should be given the right . 
  when scotland was thinking about seceding i ca n't count the number of times that i talked to scottish people who justified their own secession , but absolutely condemned the idea of the shetlands exercising their own self-determination by leaving or choosing to stay with the united kingdom * ( also of note the shetlands sits ontop of much of that juicy oil ) * . 
  that said , as long as the united kingdom does n't have a proper upper house to represent it 's constituent nations ' interests & constitutionally-guaranteed autonomy for them i ca n't really blame scotland for wanting to leave the union , even though i did n't want to see it happen because i do n't think it 's in my own country 's interests to have it 's strongest ally handicapped & i did n't trust salmond 's defense/foreign policy . 
  a country to scapegoat whenever you decide to elect a shitty politician ? 
  trolls ar n't people who hold a different opinion than you . 
   and please , go through my posting history . 
  what if the brits had given the thirteen colonies as much say in westminister , and as much constitutionally guaranteed autonomy , as spain gives catalonia ? 
  her country being the wealthiest & most economically stable in europe . 
   the eu is going to do exactly * nothing * until we either have a new state or not . 
  ** that 's my point . 
  ** i 'm not advocating the eu do anything to help spain in this situation . 
  in fact , i 'm strongly against even the notion of that . 
  but i am saying it will seriously shake the union if the eu tries to go against spain & help * ( or force ) * catalonian independence . 
  who said i view it as politically incorrect ? 
  who said i do n't support catalonia independence ? 
  who said you should ban countries from having refredums ? 
  * what the fuck are you even talking about ? 
  * lol please . 
  this is n't so much about bavaria leaving as it is about the eu gaining the precedent to unilaterally step-over & sweep-aside germany 's constitutional court , to divide up the country against the german government 's will . 
  the precedent set is n't one that opens the door to germany choosing to do it , it 's one that opens the door to it being forced on germany , and forced on belgium , and the idea of that would scare the fuck out of the united kingdom & france . 
  not to mention italy with it 's north-south divide . 
  you do n't think this would n't drastically increase the support for parties like vvp & national front in the netherlands & france respectfully , despite them not having serious independence movements ? 
  how do you think this would affect future countries thinking about joining the euro & integrating further into the eu ?
