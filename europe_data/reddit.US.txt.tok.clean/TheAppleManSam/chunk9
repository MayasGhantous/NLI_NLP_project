  or just joining the eu in general as is the case with switzerland & norway ? 
  you do n't think this move would give a boost to ukip , vvp & the national front ? 
  not to mention how will belgium act ? 
  germany at the thought of the eu being able to go over their highest courts to force a bavarian secession ? 
  do you think switzerland & norway are ever going to join after such a move ? 
  how will italy react with the divide between north italy & south italy ? 
  if a couple members leave , you do n't think the chances of the scandinavian countries leaving & forming their own union does n't go up ? 
  other than that , how does that bode for the north-south eu/eurozone divide in general ? 
  in the past couple decades it 's usually been the europeans doing this sort of thing . 
   do n't confuse our founding history with your recent history . 
  the troubles were n't that long ago , the balkans ar n't that far , ukraine is n't that stable & nicolae ceau\u0219escu did n't step down that peacefully . 
  an franco is n't exactly ancient history either . 
  [ ** spanish army chief arrested after threatening uprising ** ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/09/spain.gilestremlett )  * military could intervene in catalonia , says general  * speech says charter seen as threat to national unity  a spanish army general was under house arrest yesterday and awaiting dismissal after saying that the military might step in to halt plans for greater autonomy for the wealthy eastern region of catalonia . 
   lieutenant general jos\u00e9 mena , the head of spain 's 50,000-strong ground forces , told officers under his command that the country 's constitution gave them the right to act if the * `` unity of spain '' * was in danger . 
  his comments , made in a public speech , copies of which were distributed to journalists , saw him called in by the defence minister , jos\u00e9 bono , and placed under house arrest until he can be formally dismissed at a cabinet meeting on friday . 
  [ ** spanish army colonel threatens : ** ** `` * catalonia 's independence ? 
  over my dead body * '' ** ] ( http://www.cataloniadirect.info/2012/08/spanish-military-threatens-catalonias-independence-over-my-dead-body/ )  spanish army colonel francisco alam\u00e1n castro has declared on an interview to a spanish website that * `` catalonia 's independence will be over my dead body and many others ' too . 
  the military made a sacred vow to carry out the constitutional command which consecrates the unity of spain as a inalienable right . 
  we also vowed to defend its territorial integrity with our lifes if necessary . 
  but we have something those people will never have : sense of honor and duty '' * [ ** spanish military association wants `` declaration of war '' against separatist catalonia ** ] ( http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2012/10/spanish-military-association-wants.html )  the ame , a spanish military organization says in an interview on dutch tv * `` in the event of tampering or separatism '' * the military should act . 
  if it was any other way the un would be the most effective institution on the planet . 
  that or we 'd be in the middle of a nuclear holocaust . 
  or both !, 
  than prepare to be surprised at just how unfriendly countries are to the idea of being apart of a organization which allows their constituent regions to go above them & force a national break-up . 
  the only reason the un works is because all the countries which can actually force or * [ effectively ] * oppose such a move already have a permanent seat on the unsc with that oh-so-luxurious veto , and damn near every country in the world gots one of them looking out for them . 
  of course that comes with the trade-off of being fragmented & ineffective at * many * things other than a handful of situations which no major powers have serious conflicting interests in , but meh . 
  it 's the price you pay for such privileges . 
  we can see how effective it 's been with russia & turkey . 
  i could honestly see a precedent like that snowballing into the dissolution of the european union . 
  ** edit : ** i 'm getting downvoted , but seriously guys , countries usually do n't like being apart of organizations that can split up their country . 
  crazy , i know . 
  ** edit2 : ** alright , so a organization whom 's members ca n't agree on a single foreign policy , single military & proper fiscal union for their currency union * ( which a number of members ar n't even apart of & seem to be very reluctant to become apart of ) * , are apparently fully prepared to set a precedent which could severely endanger their sovereignty & territorial integrity by allowing the eu to divide up one of their nations . 
  perfect logic here guys . 
  case closed . 
  that argument works if you consider america a socialist nation because of fiscal transfers to the south . 
  ** on eurozone fiscal transfers ** so you want southern europe to feed off northern europe 's wealth against northern europe 's will ? 
  maybe you should find ways to improve the southern european economy instead of resorting to what is akin to parasitic imperialism . 
  ** on german fiscal transfers ** so you want eastern germany to feed off western germany 's wealth against western germany 's will ? 
  maybe you should find ways to improve the eastern german economy instead of resorting to what is akin to parasitic imperialism . 
  ** on italian fiscal transfers ** so you want southern italy to feed off northern italy 's wealth against northern italy 's will ? 
  maybe you should find ways to improve the south italian economy instead of resorting to what is akin to parasitic imperialism . 
  granted , but honestly a lot of things changed after 9/11 , the american psyche especially . 
  i know that sounds cliche as fuck , but it 's true . 
  compound that with the end of the cold war leaving us the most dominant global power and the fact that iraq & afghanistan , despite what you want to call them , were sure as hell no vietnam , and you can begin to see why a response to a american solider being executed would be extreme escalation . 
  the topic of the conversation is germany having a * permanent seat * , and the person i 'm arguing with saying hard power should n't be necessary to having such a seat . 
    and the reason is n't enforcement , it 's to ensure that no resolution that would go against the interests of a superpower could pass . 
  that 's the reason for the veto . 
  without it , we would n't have the whole thing in the first place because without veto , no superpower would 've had any of it . 
  imagine us , uk and france deciding that the ussr and china are to be demilitarised without the latter being able to veto . 
  that kind of scenario is what made the league of nations a stillborn initiative . 
  that basically reinforces my argument completely . 
  and i 'd argue enforcement is still one of the primary reasons , just as important as solidarity . 
  an in * both scenarios * , hard power is the deciding factor . 
   why the fuck should a permanent seat be tied to military prowess ? 
  should n't that be the notion we should be getting * away * from ? 
  the whole point of the unsc is * based on military prowess * . 
  despite what you might want it to be , the security council is n't a idealist construct , it 's a * practical * one . 
  the countries with the most hard power are the countries which actually have the capability to enforce un resolutions . 
  without this acknowledgement of them & without this mechanism of deliberation between them , the un would become more useless & less recognized than it is now . 
  ignoring that whole factor is the same reason why the league of nations collapsed . 
  who are you telling * `` i told you so '' * too ? 
  i do n't agree with the circumstances we involved ourselves in iraq under nor do i agree with the way the occupation was initially carried out until about 2007-2008 * ( luckily soon after we got a firm hold on the situation we left / s , but just for reference the iraqi public asked for the withdrawal through a referendum iirc so meh ) * . 
  but yes , you are a irreconcilable idealist if you think we could 've just pulled out of iraq early & continued the * `` nation-building '' * you allude too . 
  it 's the same idealist rabble that bush talked about early in the war , and it was n't until the troop surge that he realized no , that 's impossible , and it 's not going to happen . 
  if we want a stable iraq , we should 've stayed or we should go back and commit ourselves to a generation * ( 20 years ) * long occupation . 
  but that 's not on the table . 
  now we should at least send in special forces to assist local forces & carry out a air campaign to break-up & paralyze isis as best we can , since in my opinion , as shitty as it is , a bunch of splintered extremist militants shooting each other is better than the huge theocratic extremist state we 're faced with now . 
  the region is not going to be stable , that goal was lost with the opposition to a occupation , but the current plan is still be better than the alternative . 
  i feel the same way about afghanistan . 
  we either should stay 'till it has a stable foundation or we should 've left back in 2001 when we toppled the taliban with a couple hundred special forces leading locals . 
  sure , the taliban would 've came back , but our message was sent & they felt the hits . 
  now since we 're there though we better commit to staying . 
  i think his point is that germans are unable to move pass their genocidal past thus they 're unable to project power because of it . 
  i 've met many germans who have waived off the idea of increased military spending & commitments because of their nazi past . 
  i almost get the impression that many germans think they 're going to turn back into nazis or some shit at increased military spending like werewolves react to a full-moon . 
  have n't i seen you demand america withdraw from afghanistan ? 
  criticize our occupation there as being both illegal * ( even though it was authorized by the unsc ) * & destabilizing to the country ? 
  an ... oddly ... i would n't be surprised in * the least * if you were one of the people demanding america leave iraq back in 2008 ... 
  * so what 's your suggestion ? 
  * a non-violent protest march from damascus & baghdad to raqqa ? 
  perhaps educational grants to isis to improve their infrastructure in hopes of fostering a liberal youth in a genocidal theocratic regime so they may one day twenty years down the road be capable of initiating non-violent revolution ? 
  or just ignore the situation ? 
  give some vocal support to isis 's opposition in syria & iraq ? 
  because that 's been working * wonderfully * so far . 
  just as that mentality worked in srebrinca & rwanda . 
  i 'm not one to advocate a occupation . 
  i 'm actually opposed to it . 
  especially in regards to it giving isis a propaganda win & incentivizing their recruitment . 
  but air strikes , special ops on the ground & fracturing isis is at least * something * we can do . 
  and whether people like it or not , i do n't remember this situation being nearly as fucked as it is now when it was simply a bunch of islamist extremists on the ground with their rival bands of rag-tag musketeers shooting at each other instead of the huge theocratic megastate we 're faced with now . 
  people oppose this , but they give no other alternative to replace it , no viable solution that 's actually workable . 
  ** edit : ** seriously ... i 'm getting downvoted ... but does anybody have a alternative plan or better solution ? 
  i 'm telling you what the people want & what might be best is not always the same . 
  if it was you would n't need a authoritarian dictator in the first place . 
  no we did n't create it . 
  i mean ... why , oh why , would people * possibly * not like being under the regime of a authoritarian dictator . 
  this sentiment bewilders me completely . 
  perhaps some romanians from 1989 could enlighten me . 
  but still a accurate one none-the-less . 
  only if you fuck off back to ** reality ** .
