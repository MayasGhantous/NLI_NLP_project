  we already have grants . 
  just make another grant . 
  a lot of countries that do n't charge interest still lend money but incentivise repayment differently . 
  loans in a lot of africa and the middle east are given with the understanding that a person 's reputation will be ruined if they are n't repaid , and that system actually works there . 
  unfortunately , there 's not much here . 
  you 're just sort of writing about your feelings , you 're just like :  just make another grant \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  should i ? 
  i dunno , i 'm not really into that kind of stuff anymore . . 
  sure there are some bad things , quote `` usury '' does , but the positives outweigh the negatives by factors many times over . 
  money up front for everything , yeah like that 's how you 'll always live ? 
  one day you 'll be in a bank office praying to god the bank man gives you a positive answer , you know that . 
  the thing is , that in the west , we believe in the ` universalism ' of certain moralistic values , such as human rights , or even the separation of church and state . 
  for example , i think that many of the problems of the muslim world can be simply traced to the fact that muslims can not charge people interest to borrow them money . 
  sure there are some racists out there , but for the most part western society is fundamentally non-racist , but is fundamentally opposed to anyone who wants to infringe on the rights we hold dear that we have worked on and agreed upon over the last hundreds and hundreds of years , that hundreds of millions have died for that we may live like we do today . 
  sure , the so-called ` dark underbelly ' of western liberalism is democracy promotion abroad , which is a theme with many positives and certainly some negatives ( i.e. 
  iraq ) , and we can talk about that , but the western world is not fighting a crusade against the muslim world . 
  with that said , whatever happens , right now i 'm on the [ iraqi rambo 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0navteq9exq ) side . 
  if you think that 90 % + of the 1.5 billion muslims around the world `` support democracy '' you 're ________ . 
  more like in need of an enlightenment, 
   please step away from the mosque, 
  such victims . . 
   i does n't only make exports ( about a third is in euro-countries ) less risky and thus cheaper , but the current weakness of the euro also makes our exported products cheaper ( or really profitable ) in non euro countries . 
  yeah , southern europe has heard of this phenomenon i reckon . 
  * drops mic, 
  little known fact : soldier conrad schumann was actually jumping over barbed wire into * east * berlin . 
  history is written by the winners . 
  you say ` breedlove ' like you had actually heard of him before 2015 lol . 
  and do you get it , that he is playing the part of the role of the ` bad cop ' to the ` good cop ' of restraint ? 
  ( i.e. 
  we have n't shipped weapons to ukraine [ yet ? ] ), 
  what is he supposed to do ? 
  minimize what is happening in eastern ukraine ? 
  let 's say its 2010 or so and ukraine had n't yet happened , it was n't on the minds of everyone , and you had an international relations class where the professor gave you a theoretical case and asked you to gauge the response of the saceur nato . 
  the professor told you that russia would invent a ` new ' kind of warfare , a hybrid warfare strategy . 
  the strategy would combine both hard and soft power , simultaneously using new technologies . 
  it would be a war of information , disinformation , propaganda , intelligence and counter-intelligence , and cyber warfare . 
  it would use highly trained commandos , ` little green men ' with no flags or insignia on their uniforms wearing facemasks , would involve non-state actors like businesses , ngos , religious organizations , criminals and private persons . 
  it would include even the state sanctioned use of terror tactics , such as using women and children as shields in attacks on military and civil objects , while also including energy warfare , economic warfare , and the use of corruption to compromise the loyalties of the political and military leadership . 
  after the professor told you about this theoretical case , asking you how you think that `` breedlove '' would respond , i wonder if you would say that you think he would probably at the very least make ` striking announcements ' about russian tank or troop movements ? 
  you probably would . 
  and you would probably say in it a way that you felt such a response would be fully justified and even not a strong-enough response . 
  yet your article that you seem to stand behind says  a mixture of political argumentation and military propaganda is necessary . 
  but for months now , many in the chancellery simply shake their heads each time nato , under breedlove 's leadership , goes public with striking announcements about russian troop or tank movements . 
  to be sure , neither berlin 's russia experts nor bnd intelligence analysts doubt that moscow is supporting the pro-russian separatists . 
  the bnd even has proof of such support . 
  as if making such striking announcements equals , in your words , breedlove wanting more than anything in the world , loving actually , `` to turn ukraine into an even bigger battlefield . '', 
  so basically , your professor gave you that hypothetical situation , and your response is that in such a case , there would be nothing more that nato would love to do than turn ukraine into a battleground . 
  do n't be so naive . 
  it is n't nato that invaded ukraine . 
  do you have any sources to back up your argument ? 
  i do . 
  ( the article this thread is on , for example ), 
   that does n't mean the eu as a whole does n't have interests ... 
  so much of what you write here in this thread is so incorrect , instead of arguing point for point , i 'll just ask - do you have any sources for your argument ? 
  or are you just writing what you feel like writing ? 
  nato . 
  there will never be a true ` eu/european army ' . 
  first , there 's no real need for one . 
  europe would have to be facing invasion from half of the world . 
  second , the idea ( better word ? ), 
  of the nation and national sovereignty are much too strong . 
  get your head out of the gutter . 
  nope , it was part of the patriot act , infamously known as the ` swarming provision ' . 
  you never heard of it ? 
  there are 50,000 troops back there you ca n't see , napoleon . 
  germany received 0 points . 
  this was all a huge cluster fuck behind the scenes . 
  i 'm doing an internship in hamburg at the record company that was handling germany 's bid - regarding which song to play . 
  there were bribes and a bunch of shady shit going on . 
  you may ask - ok , well what is/was the * real * song that would have represented germany in the 2015 eurovision - if all in-house votes were square and on the up and up ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afl9wfgje0m ) . 
  now , imagine a world in which nato did n't exist . . 
  - `` i do n't get it '' - `` what ? '', 
  - '' * that * '' - `` it 's a bradley '' \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  this is actually - basically - exactly the point i try to make all the time ( ami living in germany getting into political discussions fairly regularly ) . 
  yet is that pretty much what you would say about police in the us ? 
  i ca n't quite imagine you saying that the us is a big country , a few bad apples , etc. 
  poor luxembourg, 
  you 're not wrong , you 're not an asshole , you 're just not being politically correct on / europe . 
  what the fuck are you kidding me, 
  no worries !, 
  you 're sort of answering your own question in a way - the us maybe is n't as great a ` right-leaning country ' ( whatever that means exactly ) as you seem to think . 
  look at your user , you 're kind of weird to begin with , lord knows what some of the other assumptions are you 're operating on over there . 
  sometimes the us does things that europeans , broadly speaking , do n't agree with , at times getting angry or downright virulent . 
  but the general benevolence of the us , coupled with sharing western values and ( as an example ) being the guarantor of european security in the end and that security being tested by putin , goes a longer way with europeans than you seem to be willing to admit ( for whatever odd reason ) . 
  i 'm not convinced . . 
  - [ q ] in the end , why 'd you do it , vlad ? 
  it 's frightening , when you think about a story like this in terms of capabilities . 
  that ( some people ?????? 
  fill-in-the-blank ) are one minute drinking a coffee , the next minute - capable , given the right set of circumstances , to commit such an atrocity on a person . 
  though the story is from last year . 
  is it really  just as bad ? 
  it 's a word that makes you sound smart when you use it - / u/imliterallydyinghere knows the * full * truths , and this ai n't cutting it . 
  / s nevermind that john oliver talks about problems everyone should be concerned about ( which is what good journalism does ) , judging by this thread , a lot of europeans would rather hear about these problems in something like werner herzog 's concerned timbre . 
  how 's john oliver supposed to talk about this ? 
  for all the us 's patriotic bombast , this parade eclipses anything the us does in a single event that is meant to appeal to ideas like nationalism . 
  if pispers had , on that stage that evening , said that europeans ( too ) view themselves as little yellow flowers and africans as dirt , now that would really take some balls . 
  the question is whether ` weapons ' are counted under either ` machines ' , ` electronics ' , ` aircraft ' , etc. 
  did he say that the us ca n't build things more complex than a fridge ? 
  one thing he said that irked me was that americans view themselves and the value of their lives as a yellow flower , europeans as grass , and africans as dirt .
