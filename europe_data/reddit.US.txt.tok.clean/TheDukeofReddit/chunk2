  in 2012 , despite the crash , it is $ 249 billion . 
  a good deal , all in all , if not a perfect one . 
  the euro may have enabled greece to borrow like crazy and find itself in a situation it struggles to get out of , but it did allow it to double the size of its economy in a very short amount of time in the process . 
  similarly , when you look at all of those countries side by side , you see [ tremendous growth ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;idim=country:grc:prt#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:grc:prt:esp:ita&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  now , that is n't to say that non-euro currency countries did not also grow , but the single currency has been a boon to much of these countries as well . 
  it was always odd . 
  the idea that a no fly zone defense populations is a strange one . 
  it implies that the ruling portion of the country with an air force intends to bomb itself and hurt civilians in the process of stopping rebels . 
  which is n't that bizarre , but the idea they can not do that without an air power is . 
  air forces tend to be much more decision and consequently often much less destructive in these situations . 
  you can bomb certain areas , use them for reconnaissance , and force an end to fighting without a ton of damage . 
  they are n't actually trying to destroy their own cities , just the people in them that are causing trouble . 
  so instead you get artillery , bullets , tanks , mortars , and all sorts of things blowing apart everything in prolonged fire fights that involve civilians just as much . 
  setting up a no fly zone is pretty much supporting the people without an airforce getting hammered by one . 
  that does n't actually seem to make a lot of sense . 
  who were the countries hurt by the euro . 
  ok , now go look at their standards of living , their growth rates , their access to luxuries , and so on pre euro and post euro . 
  the euro itself is not the causal factor , despite what many want to believe and such being the conventional wisdom in english-language media . 
  rather , the euro reduced their individual flexibility to act . 
  it is n't like greece would be an economic powerhouse without the euro . 
  the euro allowed for tremendous economic growth in the country . 
  bad policy decisions and poor investments by financial markets brought it down . 
  it is tempting to say the euro was the enabler , but there is concrete reason to believe that if greece had not adopted the euro better decisions would be made . 
  it 's fantasy to assume such . 
  it 's one the british policy makers and media are all too willing to swallow because the international financial market structures which greatly contributed to greece 's troubles benefit the british greatly . 
  it 's self interest . 
  federalization is seen as a part of the solution . 
  so says the guy who trolls / r/worldnews for articles about israel calling people jidf members . 
  here are three citations : * [ -- ] downofwar [ -1 ] 0 points 23 hours ago ( ? | ? ),

  it 's basically israel 's propaganda machine .

  is that what the israelis call rocks nowadays ? 
  talk about jidf . 
  of course , all of these have actually been deleted by moderators over at / r/worldnews so i can not permalink to them . 
  maybe their moderation standards are different ? 
  you 're kind of a dick here too .

  damn you 're projecting hard . 
  we are talking about changing the name a city here , and you 've mentioned berlin so i gave you the warsaw example . 
  first of all every person i 've met never called the city `` volgograd '' all of them said something along these lines : `` i 'm going on vacation in stalingrad '' or `` i have gotten a new job in stalingrad '' you see now why people want the name to be changed ? 
  even themselves do n't refer to it as `` volgograd '' the fact that it has the name of a dictator does n't mean jack . 
  secondly the history . 
  people who look at the map trying to find stalingrad the place where the bloodiest battle in history took place will never find it because some twat decided it would be best to change the name ( same goes with leningrad ) . 
  but what i 'm even bothering trying to explain this to you . 
  you 're more than likely projecting like a mad-man and you wo n't accept facts . 
  all you think about is `` hurr durr russia evil poland good '' edit : ** nevermind i realized you were trolling , ** i give you 7/10 you made me fall for it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27iv1u/putin_vote_possible_to_get_stalingrad_name_back/ci1dlz3?context=3 ) it seems like you have a persecution complex , a strong sense of paranoia , and easy access to a keyboard . 
  just ignore him . 
  he goes around posting flamebait and does n't really have much knowledge of context . 
  i think being an unhappy accountant is worse . 
   he was a product of the us . 
  he was made by the us to punish iran for kicking out another murderous cunt ( the shah ) . 
  that is n't true . 
  he became the leader of iraq months after the shah fell and things were still unsettled as to how it would turn out . 
  the ba'ath party had been ruling ten years prior to that . 
  saddam had been second in command until he became leader , although he effectively ran the country . 
  the british and americans probably helped in the coup that brought the ba'ath party to power though . 
  they were turning communist and what not . 
   saddam got loads of weapons from the us to kill iranians . 
  iran got a load of weapons to kill the iraqis too . 
  a list of countries just in the region that got us arms include saudi arabia , the uae , egypt , and israel . 
  although saddam did receive direct u.s. assistance via intel when he went to war with iran . 
  apparently , we were using spy satellites to tell iraq about iran 's movements and military operations . 
  a pretty big advantage . 
   and wha are you talking about ? 
  * why * these things occurred . 
   us foreign policy is one bloodbath after another . 
  this is why ` why ' is important . 
  it was n't the u.s. that created unstable countries . 
  it was n't the us that drew the lines on the map . 
  it was literally done semi-randomly while drunk in some cases . 
  it was n't the u.s. that put religious zealots in power in saudi arabia . 
  it was n't the u.s. that caused the events ( world war 1 and 2 , colonialism ) which brought the conditions for these things to happen . 
  it is n't even the u.s. that has ` benefit ' from this . 
  the us was the largest oil exporter in the world during most of this time and still does not import all that much in way of natural resources from the region . 
  the u.s. actually advocated self-determination after world war 1 . 
  if the us had its way , the map would look much different . 
  how does a country run when a third of the people do not even want to be part of that country and another third hate the others ? 
  this was actually a deliberate and patterned policy in european colonialism . 
  divide the population , create a favored class based on ethnic or religious lines , then use this portion of the population to help govern the territory . 
  it divides the country , making it more manageable for the european powers to rule without having heavily occupy a country with military forces . 
  things flair up ? 
  they have their favored peoples with european arms and training to put down . 
  get out of their control ? 
  then send in forces . 
  this policy had the effect of highlighting the differences between groups and breeding deep resentment . 
  out of all this comes a fractured and unstable middle east . 
  why did the u.s. get involved ? 
  you might say its ` bloody ' but i think that is naive . 
  europeans are so comfortable in their own countries they can not imagine that similar models simply can not work . 
  it is forgotten that millions upon millions of europeans died in religious wars . 
  millions more were forced to flee their countries .
