0 since the airports are closed, 
  i guess we should avoid black people too while were at it ? 
  us citizen here . 
  we already have a kgb agent running for president . 
  dont let it happen in the eu, 
   so i hear . 
  saying this now . 
  theres no safe zones in northern syria . 
  all the `` safe '' areas are in southern syria around the damascus region . 
   there are safe zones in syria the safe areas in syria are in southern syria , all of north syria is basically a dead mans land . 
   you know , and plenty in turkey . 
  nope . 
  migrants in turkey are already alot so they travel farther in hopes they have less competition . 
   there 's no need to come all the way here , except to mooch off the state . 
  or a new life ? 
  damn ur harsh . 
  even homeless can apply and go into college . 
  if your idea is to throw them in a camp and then wonder why they get angry later , your out of your mind . 
  they migrated for a new life and thats what they are trying to do now . 
  ** edit : ** why the downvote ? 
  is it wrong they are continuing their education ? 
  you all cry that they are a burden , heres their attempt to make themselves useful but ur ganna cry about that too ? 
  except those turks that support him are n't in europe . 
  the turkish you see in germany already knew to gtfo . 
  erdogen thinks that every turk has to absolutely do what he says just like how trump thinks every american has to do what he says and the minute you criticize it , your `` an enemy '', 
  if it was , it 's a huge failure as i barely ever see it, 
  us citizen here . 
  we do ? 
  i mean we have our average nyt , wall street journal , cnn , and such but i do n't think there is an official `` us news '' center, 
  kinda dont . 
  i feel like im getting the misconception is that since they are from turkey , they support erdogen . 
  us citizen here - trump is massively unpopular and more voters supported clinton than trump . 
  im sure trump will one day shit-talk against the netherlands in his 3am tweets . 
  us americans will not support him . 
  us citizen here . 
  we got pretty used to trump just calling everyone and everything `` anti-american '' , you get used to it, 
  found the american that is affected by this, 
  `` they gave us money and then we voted for them ? '', 
  like what else are they ganna realistically say ? 
  that the ksa represents them ? 
   i expect she will try to keep her promises . 
  also good ridance eu . 
  american here . 
  we had trump for almost 100 days and he cant pass shit, 
  no one needs israel to begin with, 
  can we technically just sell a box without an os and a usb stick with the os `` separately '' and the user can install it himself which would bypass the law ? 
  well of course she hates planned parenthood !, 
  they stop viruses, 
  those dumbasses are still talking about obama & hillary as if the world never moved on, 
  fuck the alt right, 
  for the red scare ? 
  ( since i studied this in movie class , this part involves what was happening in hollywood & entertainment ) ** at the time when the ` red scare ' started ( before the cold war ) : ** around the 1920 's and 1930s - ** no ** . 
  most of the people convicted were regular americans who just had some sour taste about capitalism ( due to the lack of regulations in this brand new industry ) , the ** idea ** of communism felt like a good idea . 
  higher executives ( e.g. 
  walt disney , warner brothers [ the brothers , not company ] ) all rode this `` if you support communism , you are a terrorist '' and if you were not 1000 % against communism , consider your acting career nothing but a dream in another galaxy . 
  ** when the cold war started to begin : ** - in terms of hollywood , it was slowly dying down because everyone was fed up with the whole genre about killing nazi 's and making movies against soviets felt like the same thing so hollywood was not to harsh . 
  as for it was a good thing ? 
  at least in occupied germany , it made sense due to the extreme tensions between the two sides but as in terms of the us ? 
  while i do expect communist supporters to get hate , attempting to ruin their lives was a little too far fetched . 
  besides , communist spies dont go around saying how great communism is in fear they may blow their cover . 
   have the state approve of all imams against this . 
  sorry but expecting politicians to dictate religion ? 
  no thanks . 
  us citizen here . 
  our politians in the white house are fucking cancer . 
  hell , our president is a climate change denier . 
  imagine being tested against a person like that ? 
  can 100 % confirm in the us . 
  learned alot about it during movie class . 
  we call it the `` red scare '', 
  context ? 
   again , why do n't you attach list of atrocities made by your country ? 
  because we are talking about russia . 
  last time i heard , there was no gay concentration camp ran by the us . 
   even more , they are not pretending to be saints and knights of freedom like other high-ranked murderers . 
  so basically your cool with this whole concentration camp thing and killing off oppositions ? 
   what are you trying to say ? 
  russia has secret prisons ? 
  your country has them too . 
  yes , for putting terrorist or just huge enemies of the us ( which may not always be right ) , ** not for for a man liking a man instead of a women . 
  ** you seem to be missing this out . 
  also , lots of people went after hillary clinton & donald trump , especially trump . 
  did they disappear ? 
  or fall out of buildings ? 
  or get poisoned ? 
   russia invaded russian-populated crimea ? 
  so if a there is a syrian-majority town in the us , can syria invade it ? 
   your country invaded iraq where no americans lived and destroyed it yea , not denying that but its for oil ( which is also wrong ) . 
  by the way , russia is bullying the former soviet countries ( a.k.a ukraine ) so russia is in this too .

  or all these ` biased ' ? 
  or only news from putin 's party is considered `` actual news '' because you know , putin and his cronies would ** never ** lie, 
  except we are talking about russia , not the us . 
  us abuses , while not right , are usually for political reasons , not for being gay . 
  in russia , being gay is already enough to be thrown in a concentration camp . 
  how do you know ? 
  the fact that its pretty well known theres a concentration camp and russia is doing absolutely nothing about it shows why . 
  they can invade crimea and claim it as their own but a concentration camp ? 
  naa , too hard to stop, 
  hmm ...
