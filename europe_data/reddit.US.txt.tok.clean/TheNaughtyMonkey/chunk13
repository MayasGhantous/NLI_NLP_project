  a reasonable proxy for quality of care is cancer survival rates . 
  well , no , not because of the commerce clause . 
  it was ruled constitutional under congress 's power to tax . 
  you might want to read the quote i provided . 
  well , yes , there is the medicare gap , in some states ( mostly tx , fl , and nc ) . 
  its about .9 % of the population . 
  but , if you are arguing that the aca was a badly written law , i have no disagreement .

  is his family not in council housing ? 
  no , that is not true . 
   the mandate is constitutional : in plain english  although the court had four questions before it , the focus of the challenge to the affordable care act ( aca ) was the so-called individual mandate -- the requirement that almost all americans buy health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty . 
  defending the constitutionality of the mandate , the government 's primary argument was that congress can require everyone to buy health insurance using its power under the commerce clause of the constitution , because the failure to buy insurance shifts the costs of health care for the uninsured to health care providers , insurance companies , and everyone who does have health insurance . 
  five justices -- the chief justice and justices kennedy , scalia , thomas , and alito -- all rejected that argument . 
  but the government still won , because a different set of five justices -- the chief justice , and justices ginsburg , breyer , sotomayor , and kagan -- agreed that the mandate was constitutional , but for a different reason .

  its a funny cultural difference , i guess . 
  i would never presume to lecture someone from another country on their own domestic practices , especially without any actual knowledge of the issue, 
  yeah , its a mess . 
  but , the actual quality of care is great . 
  i 'm luckier than most . 
  i work for a fortune 500 company , and live in possibly the best place in the world for medical research . 
  [ ( raleigh-durham , north carolina ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/research_triangle#major_hospitals.2c_medical_centers_and_medical_schools ), 
  what we have now is just a gift from the government to the health insurers . 
  which is what happens when you let the insurers write the law mandating health insurance . 
   we also have some flat out ridiculous laws concerning federal paperwork . 
  http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-u-s-s-ailing-medical-system-a-doctors-perspective-1409325361  in surveys , a majority of doctors express diminished enthusiasm for medicine and say they would discourage a friend or family member from entering the profession . 
  in a 2008 survey of 12,000 physicians , only 6 % described their morale as positive . 
  eighty-four percent said that their incomes were constant or decreasing . 
  most said they did n't have enough time to spend with patients because of paperwork , and nearly half said they planned to reduce the number of patients they would see in the next three years or stop practicing altogether . 
   after medicare was introduced in 1965 as a social safety net for the elderly , doctors ' salaries actually increased as more people sought medical care . 
  in 1940 , in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars , the mean income for u.s. physicians was about $ 50,000 . 
  by 1970 , it was close to $ 250,000 -- nearly six times the median household income . 
   in 1970 , the average inflation-adjusted income of general practitioners was $ 185,000 . 
  in 2010 , it was $ 161,000 , despite a near doubling of the number of patients that doctors see a day . 
   u.s. doctors spend almost an hour on average each day , and $ 83,000 a year -- four times their canadian counterparts -- dealing with the paperwork of insurance companies . 
  their office staffs spend more than seven hours a day . 
  ok , so you do n't actually have any experiences to share . 
  yes , our system is way overpriced . 
  but , the actual quality of care is excellent . 
   starting in 2014 , every person in the u.s. must have minimum health coverage or an exemption -- otherwise they may pay a fee on their federal tax return - [ healthcare.gov ] ( https://www.healthcare.gov/blog/find-out-if-you-have-to-pay-a-fee/ ), 
  huge risk pool . 
  but , let me check how much a root canal would cost . 
  delta dental is the insurer . 
  looks like they pay 80 % of the cost of a root canal . 
  cost of the procedure is around $ 500 - $ 1000 , so would cost me $ 100 - $ 200 . 
   while it is technically illegal the best kind of illegal . 
  not sure how much farther we can go to provide health insurance . 
  its free for the poor , heavily subsidized for the near poor , and legally required . 
   we could n't get through the front door of the hospital without my parents producing a credit card . 
  that is actually illegal . 
  emergency rooms must give treatment , regardless of ability to pay . 
  i think that system would be a better fit for the us than an nhs style system, 
  i have dental coverage in the us ( as do most people ) . 
  i think it costs me about $ 3 per month . 
  annual cleanings are free , and i think it cost me about $ 30 to have two fillings replaced . 
  my experience as well . 
  i have a prescription that i renew every 90 days , and it costs me about $ 8 . 
  if i have to go to the doctor , i pay a flat $ 25 . 
  i pay about $ 40 per month , including vision , dental , and disability insurance . 
  yes , our system is massively screwed up , but , for most of us , we do get good healthcare for very little money . 
   the cost hospitals quote you are insane because they try to recoup the costs of the uninsured through the insured . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with your point , but no one ever pays that quoted cost . 
  and , it is now actually illegal to not have health insurance in the us ( obama-care . ), 
  sorry , but i think that is kind of funny . 
  do you have any experience with healthcare in the us ? 
  or , just repeating what you have heard ? 
  australia is not in england . 
  but , i 'm an american , so what do i know ? 
  i 'm even older . 
  and all my friends , as well . 
  they have ponds ** and ** pools .

  my brother worked there for a while . 
  he said a lot of people showed up early , and stayed late , but did n't really do much except take very long tea breaks all day . 
  anecdotal , i know . 
  i can help with the austrian/australian issue . 
  when an aussie with a strong accent says `` australia '' it sounds like `` austray-ia '' really does sound like they are saying austria , to an american ear . 
  sorry about that . 
  while he was being tried for various terrorist activities , he was supplied free council housing for his family . 
  he is now in jail , but i believe the family is still being supported bu the british government . 
  the state of minnesota has been described as like norway , but flatter , and with more norwegians . 
   i used to be fixated on airships as a child , where i first read about roald amundsen . 
  he was a total bad-ass . 
  trump is an ass , but he does have a certain gadfly appeal .

  i loved the docu when i was a kid , but that movie was really , really well done . 
  i thought i had read that they were making it a fully-government agency , rather than a public/private partnership , but i am not sure . 
  sigh . 
  and we were having a nice conversation , commiserating over our shared issues . 
  the way in which a corporation is a person is that a corporation can be sued . 
  if you want to change that , so that corporations can not be sued , i think that would be a very bad idea . 
  i hear you , brother .
