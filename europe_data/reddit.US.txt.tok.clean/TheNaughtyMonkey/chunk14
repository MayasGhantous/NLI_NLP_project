  [ its the same over here .

  lol well , it seems stupidity is universal . 
  as far as i know ( and i might be wrong ) , the eu has never actually built a permanent nuclear waste facility . 
  which strikes me as odd , as there are plenty of old , deep mines , and most of europe is seismically stable . 
  germany has tsunamis ? 
  did n't know that . 
  does germany have many fault lines , and seismic activity ? 
  why ** did ** they close all the nuclear plants ? 
  pressure from russia ? 
  so , hard coal down , but lignite steady . 
  the irony is that coal releases way more radioactivity than nuclear . 
  i had to , but i lived in one state and went to school in another . 
  there is a huge variance in drivers ' tests among the 50 states . 
  how much coal is germany using these days ? 
  i believe that the french depended on us airlift for [ at least some of its movements to mali . 
  ] ( http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/22/16646479-everyone-will-fight-african-troops-us-airlift-join-mali-operation?lite ), 
  they both use jet turbines . 
  ( turboprops ) more efficient at lower altitudes and speeds than turbojets . 
  excellent explanation . 
  thank you . 
  or . . swede . 
  i ca n't respect spineless governments . 
  yes , it appears that accepting the application of a new nato member requires consensus . 
  but , new member applications are put up to a vote , which offsets the us power . 
  well , nato is mostly europe , so why does europe want to expand it ? 
  personally , i think nato is an anachronism , and should have been disbanded . 
  while esa does great work , in the us the most interesting rocket research is actually coming from the private sector . 
  when spacex launches their falcon heavy this spring , that will be the most powerful rocket currently available . 
  and yes , all three first stage boosters will return for reuse . 
  did n't putin just dissolve roscosmos ? 
  nato expands because russia 's neighbors do n't trust her . 
  well , in our defense , when an aussie says `` australian '' it sounds to us like `` austrayan . '', 
  which is not too far from `` austrian . '', 
  no , that really is n't accurate . 
  something that had no value at all , suddenly was assigned a value . 
  that meant that wealth was created . 
  many people became very rich from trading that new wealth . 
  but , no good was created . 
  no service was offered . 
  the justification was that reduced emissions would generate a communal value . 
  but , the markets have not actually reduced any emission ( in fact , it works to increase emissions , as companies that were not polluting suddenly had pollution credits they could sell to companies that were polluting , this preventing them from reducing their pollution . ), 
  did this action reduce carbon emissions ? 
  did it make some people wealthy ? 
  do you see where i am going ? 
   you do n't create money by making something of value . 
  actually , that is how you create money . 
  but , in this case nothing of actual value was created . 
  an arbitrary monetary value was assigned to emissions , that did not exist before . 
  the companies that sold the credits got money for nothing . 
  yes , there was new money . 
  the `` companies that polluted less '' could sell something that did not exist before . 
  but , that is not really the issue . 
  the real question is did this program reduce carbon emissions ? 
  i do n't think you understand . 
  an item of value was created where there was none before . 
  that was bought and sold . 
  who ended up with this `` new '' money ? 
  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/press/carbon-credit-fraud-causes-more-5-billion-euros-damage-european-taxpayer-1265 so , where did that 5 billion euros go ? 
  [ about 100 billion euros . 
  ] ( http://www.redd-monitor.org/2014/01/09/global-carbon-markets-have-shrunk-in-value-by-60-since-2011/ ) so , where did that money go ? 
  you have no idea what my politics are . 
  because you have never asked me . 
  this just goes back to my original point about heresy . 
  i explicitly said that i agree with the general goal of reducing fossil fuels , but you can not accept that i may not believe what you believe . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11924776/qc-calls-for-ruling-to-scotch-claims-that-challenge-consensus-on-global-warming.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11924776/qc-calls-for-ruling-to-scotch-claims-that-challenge-consensus-on-global-warming.html http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/23/robert-kennedy-jr-we-need-laws-punish-global-warmi/ http://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/gore-climate-change-deniers/2015/03/16/id/630426/ http://gawker.com/arrest-climate-change-deniers-1553719888, 
  so , where did all that money traded on the market go ? 
  did it have any effect on carbon emissions ? 
  there has n't been a phone called droid in years . 
  well , that is sort of the problem . 
  `` everyone '' is using the same dataset that noaa has been caught fiddling . 
  and `` everyone '' ignores the satellite temperature data . 
  i 'm not saying yes or no . 
  i 'm a bit skeptical , but there are a lot of good reasons to reduce fossil fuels , so i reserve judgement until i see what the proposed actions are . 
  so far , all we have seen is the carbon credit market , which seems to have been a bit of a scam , and proposed taxes . 
  no , i 'm not implying any such thing . 
  i am more concerned about things like a meteo society who wants to expel members for not sharing the same opinions as them , about national organisations taking action against dissidents , and a general confusion of fact and theory . 
  i am not saying anything about climate change . 
  i am talking about how we treat dissidents , and people whose opinions on things are different from other people 's opinions on things . 
  i am also reflexively skeptical of any politician who is trying to scare me into giving them more power . 
  when i see people attempt to use the power of government to muzzle speech that disagrees with their opinions , that looks like an attack on heresy . 
  this is a separate issue from climate change . 
  i guess i just do n't like people 's speech being shouted down . 
  well , its interesting that even the most mild and reasonable statement provokes a response like yours . 
  i suppose i am just a bit more skeptical about governments expanding power than you . 
  i 'm an american visiting a european community site . 
  absolutely not my place to tell anyone what to think . 
  i just ask people ** to ** think . 
  we have a lot of experience in not believing our own media , 
  honestly ? 
  it looks more like a religious belief system than anything else . 
  casting out of heretics included . 
  i always ask * cui bono * ? 
  who profits ? 
  georgia ? 
  also . . http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/full-list-of-incidents-involving-russian-military-and-nato-since-march-2014-9851309.html, 
  amazing how that has n't changed in almost 16 years . 
  no , i would not agree . 
  diplomacy is not defined by only mouthing pleasantries to your host . 
  if the people of two countries are comfortable enough to make gentle jokes about their differences , i believe that is a good thing .
