  would n't you rather be so accepted by your so 's parents that you ** can ** point out that the meatloaf was dry ? 
  maybe it is just an american-norwegian thing . 
  maybe there is a bond there that is different from the bond we have with other nations . 
  there are certainly countries where our representative can not be honest in their opinions of things . 
  and i think that is a bad thing . 
  well , working for an embassy is nothing at all like dating a girl . 
  and no one was criticising the preparation of the food . 
  unless you are norwegian , i do n't understand your passion on the issue.the norwegians on this thread , at least , found it funny , and not offensive . 
  the americans found it funny , and not offensive . 
  however , i will make sure never to be honest in my opinions of things german . 
  we need a joke indicator . 
  euro is at what ? 
  $ 1.10 or so ? 
  that 's a lot !, 
  speak for yourself . 
  turns out , hippies [ make great cheese . 
  ] ( http://nccheesetrail.com/map.html ) i know , not a lot by european standards . 
  but , its available . 
  now wisconsin ? 
  they take cheese seriously there . 
  the only people who eat than canned stuff are stoners and ... . . kids , maybe ? 
  it 's the black lady in the red dress . 
  that 's right , a ** secret ** agent . 
  i have to try lutefisk some day . 
  is it just a really fishy taste ? 
  or something more extreme ? 
  i know the inuit in alaska have a food where they bury seal meat for a couple of weeks . 
  but , i think they just made that up to shock the tourists . 
  i hope it was n't our media ( us ) . 
  our media sucks . 
  most of the country is not like new york or los angeles . 
  no one gets offended by a `` merry christmas . '', 
  except people who get offended at everything . 
  sorry , but it might be a cultural thing . 
  i suspect that norwegians are proud of how different these dishes are , and actually expect people to hate them . 
  and , the responses were honest . 
  there is never any shame in honesty . 
  no one said anything rude about norway . 
  so , the 1938 numbers are expressed in 1960 dollars , but we do n't know what the current one is in ? 
  sorry , but that is a ** very ** useless comparison . 
  that was my thought . 
  $ 125m how much is that in real money ? 
   every pound spent on education is brought back into the economy by better educated professionals contributing more . 
  which means your increased pay as a result of your education allows you to repay the loan . 
  ca n't have it both ways . 
  selective service meant that civilian receivers could have their signal degraded in a region . 
  it has not been enabled since 2000 . 
  better accuracy for gps comes from ground stations . 
  this is called waas , and has an accuracy of about 1m . 
  nexgen gps will be accurate to .63 m , but with a much more powerful signal . 
  waas may reduce that , i suppose . 
  1 cm accuracy is pretty amazing , when you think about it . 
  the system being deployed in romania is different ( standard missile 3 ( sm-3 ) interceptor missiles block 1 b ) but , yes , easily over-whelmed . 
  that is not actually true http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/  the accuracy of the gps signal in space is actually the same for both the civilian gps service ( sps ) and the military gps service ( pps ) . 
  however , sps broadcasts on one frequency , while pps uses two . 
  this means military users can perform ionospheric correction , a technique that reduces radio degradation caused by the earth 's atmosphere . 
  with less degradation , pps provides better accuracy than the basic sps . 
   many users enhance the basic sps with local or regional augmentations . 
  such systems boost civilian gps accuracy beyond that of pps . 
  ( edit : this is called agps ), 
  other than pride , what is wrong with the us gps system ? 
  they turned off the selective availability ( better accuracy for military ) years ago ( mid-90 's ? ), 
  its not like they charge anyone to use it . 
  can not protect from russia at all . 
  the system can only handle a very few icmb intercepts . 
  romania wants the base so that the us has to pay extra attention to defense of romania . 
  i suspect a lot of countries do n't really trust the nato guarantees , and are trying to forge bilateral defense agreements . 
  unless the russians were completely surprised when missiles started falling , they would not be using a second strike . 
  the doctrine has always been to fire the missiles upon ** detection ** of incoming missiles . 
  but , vmedhe is absolutely correct . 
  the system is designed to handle one or two missiles , not a mass launch . 
  well , in the us , at least , we have almost no male teachers . 
  three i know left because they were afraid of a student accusing them of molestation , to get a better grade . 
  i knew someone would say that . 
   quite rightfully , too . 
  well , some people whine about american , so i like usian . 
  now , if i can just get the ukians to agree ... 
  ok , the first one is not a treaty . 
  notice that word is never used . 
  it also seems ( according to the wikipedia article ) to be on very dubious legal ground . 
  the second citation says :  decision of the council and the commission of 19 april 2000 on the conclusion of a euro-mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the european communities and their member states , of the one part and the state of israel , of the other part again , not a treaty . 
  there is no binding agreement . 
  you will not find a treaty by the eu , because the eu is not a country , and can not sign a treaty . 
  that is my point . 
  this is n't any sort of criticism . 
  i am just pointing out that the eu , not being a country , can not enter into the types of treaties that countries can , such as a reciprocal visa-free travel arrangement . 
  that does not stop the member states from signing their own treaties . 
   what do you mean by `` you '' in this sentence ? 
  ok , replace that with `` one . '', 
  no , i can not think if a single treaty between a country and a non-country . 
  but if you know of one , i 'm glad to admit i 'm wrong . 
  no , the passport is not granted by the eu , nor can it be revoked by the eu . 
  it is a german passport , issued by the country of germany . 
  i know it has eu logos on it , but that does n't actually mean anything . 
  ( my passport has an eagle on it . ), 
  so , it might be a little annoying to have to get a visa , but i do n't think its the end of the world . 
  harder for us , possibly , as most of the us is nowhere near foreign embassies and consulates ( those are in new york , dc , and maybe la. 
  actually , the answers were no , no , and no . 
  hey , you raised the issue , not me . 
  insofar as we are talking about visas , it is relevant , as the eu does not grant visas , so no reciprocal arrangement is possible .
