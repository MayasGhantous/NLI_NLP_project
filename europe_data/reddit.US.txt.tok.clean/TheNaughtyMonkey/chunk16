  well , you are technically correct , which is the best kind of correct . 
   but , i still maintain that the eu is not a country , even though it says you have `` citizenship . '', 
  notice that this citizenship carries no rights or recognition in countries outside the eu . 
  do you think that the eu is a country ? 
  can germany revoke a spanish passport ? 
  does the eu sign treaties with other countries ? 
  you can not have a treaty between a country and a non-country . 
  that is why all us treaties are with the individual members of the eu , and not the eu as a whole . 
  no , a member passport is not an eu passport . 
  it is issued by the country one is a citizen of . 
  germany can not revoke a spanish passport . 
  the visa thing is annoying , indeed . 
  ( i travel to europe a fair bit . ), 
  but , you get a visa that is good for like 10 years , so its not every trip you have to do the paperwork for . 
  no , that passport is issued by your country , not by the eu . 
  do you think that the eu is a country ? 
  well if the circumstances of the first denial are still in effect , i could see that . 
  criminal record is a big no-no . 
  well , not really . 
  i would hope that we can all agree that the multi-culti experiments of the 90 's were a failure . 
  unless you can assimilate immigrants , they will continue to exist as a society within a society . 
  i know no european wants to take any guidance from the us , but immigration and assimilation is one of the things we do reasonably well . 
  i was responding to this post :  are there any countries outside of europe that recognize eu citizenship ? 
  no , if the eu is a country , than where do you get an eu passport ? 
  who at the eu signs treaties with other countries ? 
  no , the eu is not a country . 
  you said nowhere in the eu resembles gaza . 
  i gave you a photo that could be gaza or the eu . 
  i ca n't make it any simpler . 
  hmm , i still thought i saw them asked in the line , but maybe that 's changed . 
  not our butt-buddy , but our natty hat . 
  actually , it does n't . 
  where do you get an eu passport ? 
  are there any countries inside the eu that recognize eu citizenship ? 
  for instance , where do i get an eu passport ? 
  the us has no obligation to allow anyone in without a visa . 
  yes , our immigration policy is screwed up . 
  we have about 11-14 million economic refugees living here . 
  if you hate the minor paperwork of a visa so much , then i am sorry you will not be able to visit the us . 
  well the eu is not a country . 
  it has no passports , and no visa agreements with the us . 
  a us state is part of a single country . 
  the eu members are not parts of a single country . 
  each eu member has a foreign minister ( or equivalent ) , no us state does . 
  that is absolutely correct . 
  however , given the exchange rate , that 's a lot more usians on holiday in the eu than vice-versa . 
  not true . 
  the eu is not a country . 
  the us can , and does , have different visa requirements for different eu countries . 
  the schengen agreement does not apply to the us . 
  i think the description is apt for the banlieues . 
  is this [ gaza , or eu ?

  i talked to a guy who worked immigration . 
  he said the questions were more so they could observe how the person behaves when answering . 
  where do you see that ? 
  so , he will have no problem with the interview , then . 
  would you agree that there is an issue with eu residents who get radicalized in the middle east ? 
  dude , do n't confuse them . 
  they still do n't see how carson can be black , and a heart surgeon . 
  no , what you say is not true . 
  europe is n't a country . 
   exactly , the reason the unsc `` works '' ( read : major nations continue to participate in it ) is because every member has a veto . 
  no , they do n't . 
  only the permanent members of the security council have a veto . 
  the other members do not . 
  ok , i did n't expect that . 
  yeah , you did n't see that coming , did you ? 
  they are sneaky . 
  well , i guess president-elect trump has passed laws and implemented policies already , then . 
  i did not know that . 
  he was legally elected . 
  either deal with it , or plan your emigration . 
  and no , i did n't vote for him . 
  its those damn catholics again !, 
  i ** know ** it !, 
  but it would be fair to say that a majority of germans do not support them ? 
  what is the current support for the cdu at ? 
  ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/e5db20ee-9449-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582 )  the chancellor 's mea culpa speech last month , in which she admitted to past mistakes in refugee policy -- before 2015 -- has so far made little impression on voters . 
  national polls put ms merkel 's ruling cdu/csu bloc unchanged at about 30 per cent , down from 41 per cent in the 2013 election . 
  the anti-immigration alternative for germany ( afd ) remains on about 13 per cent . 
  i think a lot of people would disagree with you about that . 
  well , let 's be accurate . 
  he said that women wanted him so much , he ** could ** grab them by the pussy , and they would consent . 
  well , the president actually does [ have the power ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/16/the-past-six-presidents-have-all-used-executive-power-to-block-certain-classes-of-immigrants/ ) to ban certain catagories of immigrants , if it is a public threat . 
  obama and bush both used this power 6 times . 
  he really did n't call all mexican immigrants rapists . 
  he did imply that a lot of them are , which is [ unfortunately true . 
  ] ( http://www.illegalaliencrimereport.com/tag/mexican-rapists/ ) trump says a lot of shit . 
  his supporters liked that he did n't run everything he said past a focus group . 
  but , media sources that do n't like him exaggerated almost everything he said , to make it look worse . 
  funny thing is , i did n't even vote for him . 
  this is very correct . 
  the problem with blaming every conveived ill on the majority is that they eventually remember they can vote , and win elections . 
  because , majority . 
  clinton was also literally endorsed by the kkk . 
  now , most europeans do n't know that the kkk is maybe 5,000 people total , confined to basements and bad websites . 
  and you are direxctly part of the reason that trump won . 
  if you really think that all straight white men are to blame for everything , then i am glad that you can sob yourself to sleep with your racist tears . 
  trump won because those people that you love to demonise realised that they could vote , and were the majority .
