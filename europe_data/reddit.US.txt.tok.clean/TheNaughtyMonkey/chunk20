  bit of a jump there . 
  i am not voting for either one . 
  i belive mrs. clinton to be completely corrupt , and has a cv of incompetence at every job she has held . 
  trump is a pandering blow-hard . 
  who would be worse for the us ? 
  that is a tough call , but as the republican party controls the legislature , and they hate trump almost as much as they hate clinton , i think they would prevent trump from actually doing anything . 
  while everything that mrs clinton does turns to shit . 
  we are screwed either way . 
  do you want the asshole , or the crook ? 
  well , illegals do commit a huge number of crimes , including rape . 
  far out of proportion to their numbers . 
  no , we only do that on tuesdays . 
  i honestly have absolutely no idea what your point is . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  what is funny about that , is that more people move from new york to alabama , than vice-versa . 
  why , are they taking away his eu passport ? 
  no longer get to vote for eu assembly ? 
  i knew the brits loved their bacon , but arresting people for wasting it ? 
  harsh , man . 
  harsh . 
  no , that is n't true at all . 
   boeing offered a very low price to build and own its plane , while over-confidence and maybe funding constraints led eads to bid less aggressively . 
  since the two rival tankers had already satisfied 372 mandatory performance requirements , price determined the outcome and boeing emerged victorious . 
  in other words , boeing won because eads made a mistake -- it failed to tap the european government subsidies that have allowed it to develop every commercial transport it currently offers to a sufficient degree so it could overcome the pricing advantage boeing had from offering a much smaller plane . 
  smaller planes cost less to manufacture and to fly , but that has not stopped eads subsidiary airbus from beating boeing on price in scores of commercial competitions . 
  in the tanker contest , though , eads either bid too optimistically or failed to leverage subsidies for some other reason , so it was out of the money . 
  - [ forbes ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2011/02/28/how-boeing-won-the-tanker-war/#280e2c68482a ) india also rejected the mrtt on cost grounds  india has withdrawn the tender for a much-awaited contract for the purchase of six multi-role tanker transport ( mrtt ) aircraft with airbus defence and space , worth more than $ 1 billion , on grounds of the planes ' high operational cost . 
  - [ source ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/2016/07/29/india-cancels-deal-six-airbus-tankers/87720726/ ) that forbes article is very good , and gives a great explanation of the entire process . 
  bottom line : the eads plane was too large , too expensive , and cost too much per hour to operate . 
  actually , one is . 
  of course the us would buy from airbus , if airbus provided the best proposal . 
  a400m is a good airplane , no question . 
  but , it is different from a c-130 : longer range , higher ceiling , more power . 
  requires longer runways , costs more to run , and more to buy . 
  there are some advantages to using the same airframe for 60 + years of manufacturing . 
  airplane ? 
  i know we buy embraers from brasil ( a-29 ) , and dehavillands from canada . 
  we have some c-23s shorts , built in northern ireland . 
  alenia c-27s are from italy . 
  c-29 from british aerospace . 
  c-41 from construcciones aeron\u00e1uticas sa ( now part of airbus ) . 
  the last fighter we bought from europe was the harrier . 
  cs_thor - i have to say , your comments on this thread are very informative . 
  thank you for that . 
  a400m is a highy capable airplane , but also costs about 2.5 x what a c130j costs . 
  a400m is a much larger airplane . 
  also costs about 2.5 x as much as a c130j, 
  ah , my all-time favorite plane . 
  when a plane is designed and first built in 1956 , and continues in production ** 60 years later ** that 's a good design . 
  plus , largest plane on skis , and carrier capable . 
  i thought they only protested the us . 
  why are they protesting a polish action in germany ? 
  well , there actually is a dividing line , that being the point at which the other plane becomes visible to the naked eye ( vr = visual range ) . 
  the f-22 is designed to launch a long-range missile attack , before being detected . 
  the plan is that the target has no warning , just an incoming missile when that is detected . 
  this is not new . 
  the f-4 phantom did n't even come with a gun , orignally , because the idea was that all engagements would be miissiles . 
  the us military has worked on systems integration over the comparative performance of any particular part of the system . 
  an f-22 without some sort of radar assistance would be almost useless . 
  so , the f-22 depends on things like the awacs . 
  just the plane , compared to just another plane , is rather useless . 
  but , the bottom line is that the us works hard to avoid fair fights . 
  and an f-22 in a dogfight with a gen4 fighter is far too close to a fair fight . 
  what misconception ? 
  sorry , i went back and read your post , and i think you are just referring back to the red flag exercse , and the wvr flights . 
  if i had to dogfight , i would probably prefer the typhoon . 
  but , the idea of the f-22 is to avoid the dogfight . 
  it appears that i have offended you , or somehow you are interpreting my comment as a nationalistic assertion . 
  the typhoon is an excellent plane . 
  the f-22 is an excellent plane . 
  but , they are not designed to do the same things , and so they do not do everything equally well . 
  the way in which each plane will be used is what is important . 
  an f-22 should ** never ** find itself in wvr engagement . 
  it has been highly optimised for bvr . 
  conversely , a typhoon is far more suitable for such an engagement . 
  bottom line : the question of which is a better plane in a `` fair fight '' is a moot one , as us policy is to never get into fair fights . 
  completely different airplanes , with different tasks . 
  f-22 is a stealth aircraft , made to engage enemy planes at long distance . 
  eurofighter is more of a dog-fighter , designed for close in and visual range engagements . 
  given a choice , i would take the f-22 , whcih can probably destroy the eurofighter before it is ever spotted . 
  you built a wall to keep out a million migrants . 
  the us gets about 4-5 million per year . 
  `` populist reasons ? '', 
  i really do n't think you understand the issue in the us . 
  yes , fences and walls are completely unlike . 
  one is meant as a barrier to entry , and the other is meant as a barrier to entry . 
  see ? 
  lol snap !, 
  ** a ** wall ? 
  well , i suppose that is [ technically correct . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/map-refugees-europe-migrants-2016-2 ), 
   the index was created by the z/yen group for the city of london . 
  `` the index was created by the z/yen group for the city of london . '', 
  curse your european technical prowess !, 
  so , can we get one of those `` technical barriers ? '', 
  are they easy to set up ? 
  oh , a fence , not a wall . 
  i am so sorry . 
  of course , those are completely different things . 
  so , austria has already built a fence to keep out illegal immigrants , but trump 's proposed wall would be way worse because ... reasons ?
