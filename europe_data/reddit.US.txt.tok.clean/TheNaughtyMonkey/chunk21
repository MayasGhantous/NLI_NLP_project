  rabbits . 
  lol roman , in my case . 
  first of all , i love your close . 
  i fi do n't agree wiht you , you have no interst in the discussion . 
  might i point out that you are not actually having a discussion , you are expressing your opinion , and pre-emptively stating you do n't wan tto hear any disagreeement . 
  trigger warning : i am going to disagree with you . 
  i do not think you have any objection to current or proposed wall , in itself . 
  you are only criticising it because of who is talking about it ( trump ) , and the country doing it ( not the uk ) . 
  walling off illegal migrants is walling off illegal migrants . 
  i can think of no reasonable criticism that allows walling off of small borders , but not larger borders . 
   millions in economic losses and puts lives in danger again , i do n't see the difference . 
  i do n't think you are familiar with the issues of the us southern border . 
  so , your objections to trump 's wall are simply based on scale ? 
  do you happen to know , off hand , how much of the us \\ mexico border is ** currently ** walled ? 
  and the difference is ... ? 
  is that the real issue here ? 
  that he wants mexico to pay for it ? 
  that is easily remedied , as he is now talking about using funds confiscated from drug cartels to pay for it . 
  so , no problem with the trump wall now ? 
  please explain that difference . 
  i do n't agree with you , btw . 
  if it is a wall being built to prevent free access to a country , then that is what it is . 
  based on the feedback about trump 's ** plan ** to build a wall , i can only assume that the british government is racist , and fascist . 
  yes , surprises me , too . 
  but , the internet has spoken . 
  i can change every person 's opinion of their rail system in this thread . 
  all i have to do is agree with them , as an american . 
  that lady has a very nice accent , and voice . 
  actually , most of our fiber infratructure was paid for by the investors in a failed private company : global crossing, 
  its hard to tell . 
  most of the time differences between the us and europe come up on this sub , it is accompanied by expressions of superiority . 
  insulation is far more important in most of the us . 
  even if a house is built of stone ( or brick ) , an inner wall of wood is normal , to contain the insulation . 
  wood frame houses tend to be more energy efficient . 
  if you are in an area prone to tornadoes ( as most of the us is ) brick is slightly more resilient , but far more expensive to repair . 
  cracks in a brick house can be very costly , while the same wind might cause readily repairable damage to a wood frame house . 
  ( test : hit a brick house with a sledge hammer . 
  get estimate for repair . 
  do same with wooden house . 
   ) brick is strong for compressive loads , but not for tension loads , whcih is what you typically get in very high wind situations . 
  i suspect brick/stone would do better in a flood zone . 
  seismically , wood home construction is far , far better . 
  so , its a combination of cost , maintanence , safety , and custom . 
  wood houses are suitable for most of the us , and make use of a resource we have in abundance . 
  seismically better , can be better in high wind conditions , can be more structurally resistant to fire , etc. 
  we are n't talking log cabins , here . 
  we use less stone . 
  if you are concnerned about climate change , concrete making is one of the largest source of co2 . 
  wood is a renewable resource . 
  a well-built wood house is as sturdy as a brick house . 
  but , i think i had better ask you what you mean by `` quality . '', 
  are you including energy efficiency ? 
  cost of materials ? 
  aer you comparing similiarily priced homes / or inexpensive us ones vs expensive european ones ? 
  i am currently looking to buy a house , and am looking at both brick and mainly wood construction . 
  hard to find new houses of brick , but slightly older ones ( say , 40 years old ) are about the same price . 
  lol that 's a good one . 
   also i have lived in the states for quite some time and your building standard is way lower than in europe . 
  no , it really is n't . 
  we are a fast growing country , and have to add a lot of housing . 
  also , we have to build for different environmental standards that are rare in europe ( eg tornados , earthquakes , large temperature variations , etc. ), 
  ( i see you are from austria . 
  we add about 1 austria 's worth of population every 4 years . ), 
  the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is czech republic - usd 18 953 us - usd 41 071, 
  i 'm in north carolina , and get 340 mb/sec, 
  trump is a bufoon , at times , but he is n't a racist . 
  our media has completely sold out to protect the establsihment candidate . 
  trump is a very poor candidate , but 90 % of what you read about him is made-up indignation . 
  he just is not very pc . 
  i have moved around a lot in the us , and making friends is not that hard , no matter your color . 
  and you are confusing morality with legality . 
  why is a government `` due '' taxes ? 
  and , who sets the level of what is due ? 
  if it is the government itself , then how can you accuse them of fraud if they use tax code to incent behaviour ? 
  the irish government constructed their tax code in such a way as to provide incentives for companies . 
  they legally , and voluntarily , forgo tax income to obtain other benefits . 
  now , the eu is not ruling against apple . 
  apple did nothing illegal . 
  they appear to have ruled agsint the tax provisions in ireland that were extended to apple , as illegal state aid . 
  what i find interesting about this is that the eu is overrulling the tax code of ireland , and invalidating irish tax code , * ex post facto . 
  * apple is not being charged additional tax moving forward , but is being told to pay what would have been owed if the irish tax provisions had never existed . 
  this raises an interesting legal precedent , when a country is no longer in the position of being able to set its own tax rates and policy , and corporations operating in that country have to account for the risk of ** future ** changes to the tax code being applied retroactively . 
  in practice , this removes from eu countries the ability to use tax incentives to attract business . 
  also , seems a back-door into the eu asserting a power to normalise tax codes among its members . 
  it is a very tricky question , but i do come back to this idea that there is some value of taxes that are `` due '' to a country , but that value can not be set by the country , but imposed externally , by whom ? 
  `` morally ? '', 
  the morality of paying taxes ? 
  moral fraud ? 
  in contrast , in the us a publicly held company can be sued by its shareholders for not making sufficient effort to pay the lowest legally obligated taxes . 
   any legal construct that goes against object and purpose of the fiscal legislation involved is indeed fraud in my eyes . 
  so , a government that passes inconsistent tax laws is commiting fraud ? 
  an interesting , although unworkable , view . 
  no , you can not say fraud was committed if no law was broken . 
  unless you think that any tax breaks at all are `` fraud ? '', 
  ah , got it . 
  sorry , was confused . 
  taking advantage of legal tax breaks offered to attract businesses is `` disgusting ? '', 
  who is the disgusting one ? 
  the company , or the government that is inducing the company ? 
  actually , us emission standards have always been more restrictive than the eu .
