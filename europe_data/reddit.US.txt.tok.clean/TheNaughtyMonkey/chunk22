  eu is catching up a bit , recently . 
   us taxes companies for profits anywhere in the world , not only profits in us soil . 
  no , they do n't . 
  the us has a high corporate income tax rate , so companies try to keep as much revenue as possible outside the us . 
  if companies try to bring that money into the us , the irs will tax it a second time , true . 
  do n't fuck with the taxman , man !, 
  was he also a clinton critic ? 
  funny how people who criticise power end up killing themselves . 
  secretary of state for the av club ? 
  well , technically italian was my mother tongue , although i have forgotten it all . 
  i would say mandarin , and ` murican . 
   i get absolutely insights into american culture . 
  no , i do n't think you do . 
  or , more accurately , you have no way of differentiating beween accurate insights and inaccurate ones . 
   media is global and heavily dominated or influenced by america . 
  well , yes . 
  that is the problem i am talking about . 
  what you get as insights are limited to the views of the people who create the content you watch . 
  so , hollywood as an industry is made up of people who are highly unrepresentative of the united states : socially , politically , economically , and culturally . 
  us print media is principally based in new york city . 
  again , at best you are getting some insight into the views of new yorkers . 
  the entire new york city metropolitan area , the us 's largest ( including parts of 4 states ) , is only about 6 % of the us population . 
  i was born in italy . 
  i have lived in the uk , australia , and the us . 
  the us that i live in has very little in common with the us that i see on tv and movies . 
  i can only assume that its the same for other countries . 
  consuming us pop culture absolutely does ** not ** give you any special insight into the us , and has the harmful effect of making people believe they do have such insights . 
  i still think that there is significant harm from consuming too much pop media intended for a different country . 
  on the german side , i think it gives you the false idea that you have some knowledge or insight into the us . 
  you do n't . 
  what you may have is insight into the small community that creates pop media , which is ** highly ** unrepresentative of the country at large . 
  on the us side , i think it gives us less incentive to try to understand other cultural contexts , as it is just easier to use us metaphors , and assume that people understand . 
  lol, 
  frankly , and i know this is an unpopular opinion , i think europeans consume way too much us-centric media . 
  not healthy for you , in that you are bombarded with pop media you do n't have the context for . 
  and bad for the us , in that it just causes more people to hate the us . 
  there ** has ** been a [ general downward trend ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-srzvocu46bo/vbcovpjakhi/aaaaaaaae_g/si5yezk3vkc/s1600/homicide_chart.png ) in homicide rates in the us . 
  if you are going to discuss the issue , that is rather a fundamental point . 
  btw , the 2015 number was the first increase in about 30 years , from 4.5 to about 4.7 . 
  fair point . 
  w00ster set me off ( and stole a most excellent name ) . 
  his opinion was unsolicited , and inaccurate . 
  sorry about that . 
  well , given the irrelevance to the issue , and your displayed inaccuracy , why would you think that your opinion has any value to anyone ? 
  no , it is ** exactly ** as meaningful a statement as the title of this thread . 
  your un-solicited opinion of our laws notwithstanding . 
  ( also , not true . 
  the only european countries that have homicide rates less than 1/10 the us 's are monaco , san marino , and iceland . 
  and three european countries have homicide rates higher than the us [ albania , lithuania , and ukraine ] i did not count russia . ), 
  up until last year , the us was actually at a 100 year low for homicide rate . 
  the geek shall inherit the earth . 
  will correct my post . 
  by reports , he bought a reactivated glock from ( edited and corrected ) slovakia none of the points raised in the article were relevant . 
  amazingly , i do wear shorts to work . 
  ah , it . 
  the last refuge of the permanently childish . 
   awkward one liners on how americans are the best at everything ? 
  how did you get that from `` not to criticize french engineering , which is awesome . '', 
  and , if you read the linked article :  ge reports : guinness world records said that bouchain is the world 's most efficient combined-cycle power plant . 
  what does that mean ? 
   john lammas : it means that we use natural gas to generate electricity inside an ultra-efficient gas turbine and then capture the heat it produces , use it to boil water and make even more power inside a steam turbine . 
   ge reports : what exactly is the world record ? 
   john lammas : the exact efficiency we measured was 62.22 percent . 
  no one can go higher than that . 
  the previous record holder came in at 61.5 percent using a non-ge gas turbine . 
  so , no one is saying the americans are best at everything , but the guinness record ( for whatever that is worth ) is specifically about the ge turbine . 
  no , but i have craved a citroen ds for ages . 
  talk about engineering !, 
  i think you actually have that almost completely backwards . 
  i 'd say ge broke the record . 
  france is the owner , not designer . 
  not to criticize french engineering , which is awesome . 
  and people give trump shit ? 
  some people are really obsessed with this issue . 
  i do n't like it when people say mean things about my willie . 
  i was born in that hospital . 
  did they really ? 
  ban you ? 
  wow , the butthurt is strong there . 
  well , in the us , we think 100 years is old . 
  lol `` far north '', 
  `` preseneted ? '', 
  excellent , thank you . 
  is it available anywhere with subtitles in english ? 
  looks interesting , but my norwegian is non-existent . 
  i think what really bother people more than anything is that no one in the us really has much of an opinion about this internal british issue . 
  providing translators from maltese is the the top job category for the maltese . 
  i know . 
  is n't it annoying when people from other countries keep interjecting themselves into your domestic issues ? 
  how do you think rich people get that way ? 
  no idea about whether it was better to settle or not . 
  just pointing out that in volatile issues , respondents frequently settle to damp down the bad pr . 
   why settle the case when you know you did nothing wrong ? 
  leaving aside everything else , you settle rather than go to court to keep legal costs down , and to fend off bad publicity . 
  oh , i do n't care . 
  i just see you referring to two avowedly partisan sites for your examples . 
  and the current leader of the kkk endorsed hillary clinton . 
  i 'm not voting for trump . 
  if you are interested in an objective discussion of what he has said , done , and may do , i 'd find that interesting . 
  but , if you are just trying to make yourself feel better through political tribesman-ship , i am not interested in that .
