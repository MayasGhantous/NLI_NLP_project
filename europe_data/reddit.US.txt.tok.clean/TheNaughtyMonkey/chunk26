  well the station wagon ( estate wagon ) begat the minivan begat the suv . 
  once all cars suck to drive , then you have to look for other reasons to purchase . 
  in the us , at least , the pickup truck rules . 
  one reason is that uni-body cars can rarely tow anything , another is that it can be a work vehicle as well as personal . 
  but , they are not fun to drive . 
  my 16 year old mercedes e class weighs less than a toyota camry today . 
  that is just weird . 
  its all a mess . 
  best selling dodge in the us is a rebodied fiat compact platform ( alfa romeo giulietta ) . 
  as fiat now owns them , every fiat dealer could be a dodge dealer . 
  current cars in the us are nowhere near as large as the old classic 60s sleds . 
  but , more and more people are driving suvs and pickup trucks . 
  i think we are losing a bit of our car heritage , as the vehicles get heavier , more technology , and less fun to drive . 
  i even see this with european cars . 
  imo , the e39 was the last `` good '' bmw . 
  i had a 530i and loved it , as it was so fun to drive . 
  its all this electric steering and smart-auto transmissions . 
  they take the fun out of driving . 
  oh , i really , really do n't care about car `` bashing . '', 
  i am painfully aware of the problems of the us car industry , and why us cars have not been successful in europe . 
  i do think , however , that in the last few years the us has been making some good cars , and am sort of curious if that is the perception over there . 
  i know that the corvette has had some racing success in europe , and that cadillac has been doing a lot of nurburgring testing , to get a tuning that is more acceptable to europeans . 
  ( there was a point , about 3 years ago , where gm had the fastest production coupe and sedan times around the nurburgring . 
  for about 2 months . ), 
  us and euro driving is very different . 
  we see more highway driving ( not stuck in traffic ) , and europe has much more urban and sub-urban driving ( where diesels rule . ), 
  i completely agree with your observations , but will only point out that newer cars get very good fuel mileage . 
  ( completely irrelevant , but most of the euro cars sold here are high end luxury models , so the average usian may get the idea that euro cars get poor fuel mileage . 
  not true , overall , but what we see . ), 
  personally , i have 3 crappy old cars ( youngest is 16 years old ) . 
  2 are european , and one is a jeep . 
  ok , first of all , there is absolutely nothing as cool as a super-charged , 550 hp station wagon !, 
  my brother is the audi fan ( he loved that allroad . 
  and would get angry when i called it `` purple . '', 
  aubergine , ha ! ), 
  the new mustang is the first one that drives worth a damn . 
  yeah , 430 hp is cool , but do n't overlook the turbo 4 . 
  bit of a sleeper , that one . 
  well , everyone 's cars got shitty in the 70 's . 
  it just took us longer to recover . 
  but , i would not say us cars got that reliable until around 2000 . 
  they have some benefits that do n't travel very well . 
  they are inexpensive for americans , get reasonably good fuel mileage ( yeah , even the corvette gets 29 mpg on the highway ( 8.1 l/100km ) and do well on smooth highways . 
  but , they just do n't seem to be built to last . 
  in the last 5 years or so , we have started to see some good cars . 
  one of my favorites !, 
  that is a great essay , by the way . 
  thank god for deer . 
  also , check out `` ferrari refutes the decline of civilisation in the west . '', 
  but his best ever was , [ `` how to drive fast on drugs while getting your wing-wang squeezed and not spill your drink '' ] ( http://www.heretical.com/miscella/reptile.html ), 
  small is cool , and that old truck is seriously cool . 
  yeah , the koreans and japanese are just too good at making reliable cars . 
  killing off everyone else . 
  i saw [ one of these ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/%d0%92%d0%90%d0%97_2121._4x4_lada_niva_4wd_ribnitz_-_flickr_-_sludgegulper.jpg ) in canada , and fell in love with it . 
  but , i 'll make do with my 23 year old jeep . 
  leaf springs and all . 
  cheap , reliable , big motor , bad suspension , cheap interior . 
  yup , as american as it gets . 
   you can pull some huge power out of that old 5.0 . 
  you english do love your convertibles . 
   last year , for my birthday , i bought a 25 year old wrangler . 
  i refuse to fix anything cosmetic , and it is crap-tacular !, 
  a completely ridiculous form of transport . 
  do not joke about that !, 
  i could sell that for good money here in the us . 
  that is just too cool . 
  i think aro was going to come into the us back in 2005 . 
  do n't know why it did not work out . 
  probably airbags . 
  and on that note , my download queue just picked up the new wheeler dealers , where they repair a fox-body mustang ( like that ) . 
  time to watch !, 
  that would be like learning to operate a dinghy by starting with the titanic . 
  lol well , the latest one is not a bad car . 
  but , imo , [ this is the best looking one ] ( http://www.jefflilly.com/gallery/muscle-cars/1967-shelby-mustang/1967-mustang.jpg ) , by far . 
  ok , that might be the oddest pairing i have seen . 
   i 've ridden in a tesla . 
  yes , ludicrously fast . 
  yes , my mum was english . 
  i have irish citizenship through my father 's side . 
  i was taking a taxi in sicily once , and the driver looked very , very german . 
  i asked if he was german , and he said his family was . 
  i asked when they moved to sicily , and he said about a 700 years ago . 
  hmm , i do n't like the first , the second has finally become a good car , and the ford mustang ? 
  well , [ too many people buying them . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4oaqhyxjma ) who can not drive . 
  that was great !!, 
  btw , i was born in rome , and for some reason have a compulsion to buy old alfa romeos . 
  well , who does n't ? 
  that does not make you a monster . 
  now , if you had a goose-stepping labrador , that would make you a monster . 
  thank you , that is exactly the kind of info i was looking for . 
  yup , i like the same thing . 
  [ here is a ford ] ( http://www.rasloto.com/pix/rons_38_april_2011.jpg ) , same year, 
  yeah , americans are firmly whatever they are . 
   i 'm a bit of a mongrel . 
  us dad , english mum , dual citizen : us and ireland . 
  nice always works . 
  reminds me of a drunken night in santorini , years and years ago . 
  i do n't want to discuss it , but those things do not corner very fast . 
  that 's an interesting view .
