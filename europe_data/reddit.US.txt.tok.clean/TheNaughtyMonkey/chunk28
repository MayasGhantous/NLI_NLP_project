  trump would have a hostile democratic party , ** and ** a hostile republican party . 
  while many people only talk left and right , i have always been more concerned with authoritarian vs anti-authoritarian . 
  and trump is not really an authoritarian . 
  why you have to be so mean ? 
  the original question was about representation . 
  that is what i was answering . 
  and i have lived in dc . 
  its a company town . 
  yes , only 38 % of the residents work directly for the feds , but you have to look at all the beltway bandits , business services , and lobbyists . 
  oh , washington dc is a very seperate issue . 
  the reason they do not have a vote in national elections is that it is a company town , and the residents are voting on how much money to give themselves . 
  even my friends and family in dc understand that . 
  if you wish to tell me which us territory you are referring to , maybe i can do that . 
  but , in general , no us citizen without voting representation pays federal income tax . 
  the only exception i can think of is dc . 
   they pay federal income tax on their wages no , they do n't . 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't understand what your point is . 
  could you be a little more specific in what you are disagreeing with me over ? 
  you are applying a british view to a us election . 
  again , right and left are overly simplistic , and i really hate using the terms . 
  in the us , positions on guns and abortion are very , very important , politically . 
  you have seen trump pander to the conservatives in the primary . 
  now , watch him pander to the rest of the country in the general . 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  in the us , the litmus test issues for left-right ( which is a simplistic way of looking at things ) are abortion rights , and gun rights . 
  it has been that way for generations . 
  my specific point is that left-right is even less useful than normal with trump , who is not consistently left-wing , or right-wing . 
  i would challenge you to find another national `` republican '' who has donated to planned parenthood . 
  that is how you see it ? 
  interesting . 
  i see trump specifically saying the person was not just a protester , but someone who was engaged in violence . 
  not what i said . 
  i said the litmus test in the us over left-right is guns and abortion . 
  well , he did n't actually say that . 
   `` it was a guy who was swinging -- was very loud -- and then started swinging at the audience . 
  and you know what ? 
   `` and i thought it was very , very appropriate , '' he added . 
  `` he was swinging . 
  he was hitting people . 
  and the audience hit back . 
  and that 's what we need a little bit more of . 
  now , i 'm not talking about just a protestor . 
  this was a guy who should not have been allowed to do what he did . 
  and frankly , if you want to know the truth , the police were very , very restrained . '' as i say , its very hard to talk about this with someone from outside the us , as you get a very skewed view of what is happening . 
  like much of the us media , most world media has condemned trump , is is willing to ascribe the worst of all intentions to him . 
  this is an excellent example . 
  he did not , in fact , tell his supporters to attack protesters . 
  what he said was that if they are attacked , they should respond . 
  remember who he is talking to , and it all makes more sense . 
  umm , well , i 'm not going to get into an argument about domestic us politics with someone looking at it from the outside . 
  just as i would not expect to understand the subtleties of your elections , i do n't expect you to understand the subtleties of ours . 
  bernie is not even a member of the democratic party , which is part of my point . 
  sanders and trump are both rejections of their respective parties . 
  the democrats just seem to be a bit better at controlling their nomination process than the republicans . 
  no , mrs. clinton is a disaster . 
  a completely ineffective senator ( only 3 bills sponsored , all minor ) , an outright disaster as secstate , and the focus of 4 seperate fbi investigations for influence peddling , lying , and basically being `` better '' then people who need to follow laws . 
  all i can say is that you really , really do n't understand this election . 
  which is entirely understandable , as even the us media ( who are unified against trump ) do n't get it . 
  look less at trump , and more at ** why ** he has such huge support . 
  as i said , i could never vote for him . 
  but , he is a fascinating ( and inevitable ) phenomena . 
  if you keep demonising the majority of the country for every ill , real or imagined , then you will lose elections . 
  because , majority . 
  his biggest draw is immigration . 
  while the us is trying to cope with very high levels of blue-collar unemployment , both political parties seem happy to let more and more people in the country illegally . 
  businesses get cheap labor , and the democrats get more minority populations . 
  my trump supporting friends say that only a very rich man can be trusted to not sell-out , and that only a true outsider can fix the problems . 
  i get the impression that a lot of people are not so much supporting trump , as rejecting clinton and cruz . 
  ( we dodged a bullet with cruz . 
  way scarier than trump . ), 
  and clinton is basically the most venally corrupt and incompetent person to run for us president , which is saying a lot . 
   we need to wait on the result of her fbi investigations to see if it effects the election . 
  well , in the us , the litmus test issues are guns and abortion . 
  trump has donated money to planned parenthood . 
  it is a mistake to impose the simplistic left-right on someone like trump . 
  he gets support because of his deliberate rejection of the two parties . 
  now , if elected , the real question is how he will deal with a hostile gop ** and ** a hostile democratic party . 
  that went godwin awfully fast . 
  no , trump is not a fascist . 
  europeans keep trying to impose european context on the us , and it does not work . 
  we do n't really have fascism , as our right-wing is basically anti-large government . 
  as i said , trump is what happens when both political parties ignore ( or outright demonise ) large swathes of the population . 
  trump is not expansionary ( in fact , a bit isolationist ) . 
  i do not support trump . 
  never will . 
  but , in fairness , most of the violence at trump rallies is directed at the trump supporters . 
  i know it is hard to tell from the confused media , but trump is n't really right-wing . 
  not left-wing , either . 
  what he is , is anti-establishment . 
  but , we only have a two party system , so he , like sanders , had to run as one of them .

  ranak , i thought it was pretty funny . 
  but then , i studied marx . 
  sometimes , i really despair for my country . 
  oh , and he is an economist , i think . 
  no , we do n't tax people who do not have representation in washington . 
  honestly , we really do n't care that much about the opinions of europeans . 
  actually , yes , that is pretty much it . 
  but , in this case , no representation without taxation . 
  you are very welcome .
