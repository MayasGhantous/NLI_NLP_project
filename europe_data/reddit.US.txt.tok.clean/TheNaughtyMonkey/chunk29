  yes , they do not pay federal tax , so can not vote in federal elections . 
  yes , they are us citizens . 
  i have a us passport , and was born in italy . 
   the sensible solution would be to give those currently in the us a path to citizenship then be more harsh on new arrivals . 
  yeah , we 've done that about 4 times already . 
  feds do n't want to secure the border , because its hard , and there is little opportunity for graft . 
   when was the last time that an iranian national was convicted of terrorism ? 
  terrorism , or sanction busting ? 
  well , at least 3 years ago . 
   an iranian man , convicted in 2013 of exporting helicopter components from the united states to iran in violation of laws aimed at protecting national security , was turned over to authorities in tehran tuesday by officers with u.s. immigration and customs enforcement 's ( ice ) enforcement and removal operations ( ero ) . 
  yes , they have us passports . 
  the kkk is a part of us history . 
  it 's no longer really a thing . 
  i think the current estimate for number of kkk members in the us is something like 5,000 . 
  statoil and circle k are both owned by alimentation couche-tard ,, 
  technically , canadian . 
  yes , they are . 
  maybe not everyone in sweden knows who the kkk was ? 
  in the us that is very similiar to [ the flag of circle k ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/weicltndnxmydi1gjgeaw6lczxlqjqb0fvgtlojg4z8ecm-d0wsl41tinckntfk5qwnq=w300 ) , a convenience store . 
  ah , i see that the parent company of circle k is the owner of statoil . 
  well , i think you are confusing two things there : population denisty of a large area , and population density within that area . 
  so , for instance , australia has a very low population density , but as it is one of the most heavily urbanised countries in the world , most of the pople live in urban areas with high population denisty . 
  well , if you look at [ the list of states by population density ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_population_density ) , i think you might reconsider that . 
  and rail is a different issue altogether . 
  the us actually uses more rail than the eu , except that in the us it is primarily freight , not passengers . 
  ( the us passenger service , amtrak , is notoriously complete crap . ), 
   us east of the mississippi is generally around the same population density as western europe . 
  sadly , i have a compulsion to check things like that . 
  i live in north carolina , which is the 9th most populous state , and the 11th most densely populated . 
  population : 10.1 million area : 139,390 km \u00b2 density : 98 km \u00b2 that is about the same as serbia or austria . 
   the aggregate for europe excluding russia , azerbaijan and georgia , the population density is 105 persons per km2 ( including them it is 31 , mostly due to russia 's vastness ) . 
  so , i would not say `` east of the mississippi . '', 
  be more accurate to say the northeast . 
  well , that was fun . 
  that ** proves ** that trump is putin 's stooge !, 
  the shoe companies i know . 
  and i have heard of hugo boss . 
  fanta is soda ? 
  braun makes electric shavers , i think . 
  schwarzkopf was the general who led the coalition in the first iraq war . 
  i have never heard of the others . 
  your knowledge of german exports is impressive . 
  but , i am just saying that these are not the types of products where people look for a made in germany label . 
  i know . 
  very good stuff , too . 
  but , not the kind if thing that most people would see a made in germany sticker on . 
  other than luxury cars , not sure i can think of a german brand sold in the us , off hand . 
  bayer , i guess ? 
   germany 's exports to america amounted to $ 118.8 billion or 8.9 % of its overall exports . 
  vehicles : $ 31.8 billion 2 . 
  machinery : $ 23.4 billion 3 . 
  pharmaceuticals : $ 13.7 billion 4 . 
  electronic equipment : $ 10.3 billion 5 . 
  medical , technical equipment : $ 9 billion 6 . 
  aircraft , spacecraft : $ 4.6 billion 7 . 
  plastics : $ 3 billion 8 . 
  organic chemicals : $ 2.4 billion 9 . 
  iron or steel products : $ 1.6 billion 10 . 
  other chemical goods : $ 1.5 billion, 
  it has been dictated that you are the happiest people . 
  you must be happy !, 
  if you are not happy , be happy harder !, 
  ok , thanks . 
  seems to be [ a lot of variation ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/arwu2014.html ) , and [ subjectivity ] ( https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mkl45eghg/1-california-institute-of-technology/#1b7a72b07749 ) . 
  i suspect the top 20 are all roughly as good as each other . 
  my own alma mater managed 375th best in the world , on this list . 
  yay , us ? 
  source ? 
  well , there 's your problem you need [ a bigger flag . 
  ] ( http://www.worldrecordacademy.com/biggest/img/largest-flag-2.jpg ), 
  i think the idea is to use this `` artificial sun '' to illuminate solar panels , which will then be used to power the artificial sun . 
  sorry , guys , but if you actually start a war over shit trump says , then your `` peace '' was tenuous to begin with . 
  the worst beer used to be us , but not any more . 
  thankfully . 
  lol the irony . 
  did i call you a `` dumbass ? '', 
  did i use any insult , derogatory language , or obscenity ? 
  yes , i disparaged your knowledge of the subject . 
  if you really find that distressing , then i suggest you find a kinder , gentler forum . 
  but , as i keep saying , it is your country , and your decision how much to spend on defense . 
  if you dont want to spend the agreed 2 % , you are free to leave nato . 
  otherwise , your country is just free-loading . 
  best part of owning a jeep is actively not caring how crappy it looks . 
  remember , `` patina '' is guy talk for `` too lazy to paint it . '', 
  given how slow that car is , i suspect that it was parked at the bottom , and the hill has risen up beneath it . 
  stpuid french , lording their beautiful scenery over the rest of us . 
  interesting to hear the german view . 
  but , i 'm not surprised . 
  i rather like the french , but we have to remember , the french do things to benefit france , over all else . 
  i do n't know what is going to happen to the eu . 
  i 'm not sure that tighter integration is possible , and it may revert back to what it looked like in the 80 's and 90 's . 
  and yes , that may mean abandoning the euro . 
  i do not envy europe the challenges in trying to forge a tighter alliance . 
  the phrase , `` herding cats . '', 
  springs to mind . 
  us military spending is too high . 
  plus , we have some rather large expenses still to be paid from the last decade of war ( medical , worn out troops , materiel being replaced ) the us can no longer afford to be the world 's policeman . 
  if most nato countries do n't want to spend 2 % of gdp , i do n't think the us will be able to cover the difference . 
  good points . 
  maybe europe should look more to the french military than the us military .
