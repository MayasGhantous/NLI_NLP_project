  my power is nuclear , and i pay about $ 0.12 per kwh . 
  over the last 2 years i have averaged 18.5 kwh per day ( with a range from 13-22 ) so , i use about 6,782 kwh per year . 
  that 's a lot of cesium , mr. chernobyl . 
   funny thing is that us made cars actually get very good fuel mileage , as we have a very large highway system , so they can maintain speed . 
  compare the fuel economy of a corvette with a ferrari of similar power . 
  no , central ac is far more efficient . 
  most of the time , it uses a heat pump , which is a very effective mechanism . 
  those little door top units use as much electricity as i use for my entire flat . 
  but the climates are not at all comparable . 
   july is the hottest month in berlin with an average temperature of 18 \u00b0 c ( 64 \u00b0 f ) and the coldest is january at -1 \u00b0 c ( 30 \u00b0 f ) - [ source ] ( http://www.holiday-weather.com/berlin/averages/ )  july is the hottest month in calgary with an average temperature of 17 \u00b0 c ( 62 \u00b0 f ) and the coldest is january at -7 \u00b0 c ( 19 \u00b0 f ) - same source for a north american , western europe has a very very mild climate . 
  i lived in tampa , fl for years . 
  average daytime high is over 30 for 6 months out of the year . 
  germany does n't get that cold or warm .

  i am going to respond to every sanctimonious assertion of european environmental superiority the same way : volkswagen, 
  its not a big house i need , but a big garage . 
  need room for projects . 
  ever seen a british garage ? 
  we do have insulation , you know ? 
  you know what generates a huge amount of co2 ? 
  concrete factories , and cement factories . 
  someone is not aware that the uk is part of europe . 
  do n't blame them on us . 
  portlandia is a comedy about insular hipsters who know nothing.you rather missed that joke . 
  please , stop thinking that us comedy tv is a documentary . 
  its what [ we learned .

  nah , trump would completely ignore turkey . 
  mrs. clinton would start a war , then deny it . 
  sen. sanders would create a thanksgiving tax on turkeys . 
  i would n't really give much attention to pres. 
  obama on this matter . 
  his record on press freedom is the worst of any post-ww2 president . 
  yes . 
  and , in fact , this is a completely different strawman argument . 
  i freely admit that it is a very rare thing . 
  was it the case for this women , or is she just claiming that status for victim-hood purposes ? 
  no , intersexual is ** not ** a third gender . 
  unless this woman has a medical condition that forces her to choose her gender ( which , as you point out , is extremely rare ) then why do the rest of us have any compulsion to indulge her fantasy ? 
  my general question is how far does society have to go to accommodate people who are either delusional , or who deliberately reject societal norms ? 
  personally , i do n't care what she wants to call herself . 
  i do care that she is attempting to use civil authority to enforce her subjective feelings on the rest of us . 
  well , you are assuming that they want to be a gender , which is what the subject of this piece is deliberately rejecting . 
  that woman is insisting that she be treated differently , as having no gender  `` my gender identity is non-binary , which in my case means that i neither identify myself as a man or a woman , '' she can insist on any delusion she wants , but why do we have to support that delusion ? 
  yes , the numbers you quoted are very , very small . 
  my understanding is that this new pronoun is invented ( like cis in the us ) and is not really used that much . 
  sex reassignment surgeries are different , as the child is then legally the sex to which they have been `` corrected . '', 
  i choose not to engage with people who rely on insult . 
  i do n't think you understand the use of analogy . 
  but , someone was asking in an eli5 about the definition of a strawman , and this is one . 
  ok , first of all , i applaud you for actually citing evidence . 
  that is a refreshing change here . 
  the lifetime prevalence of delusional disorders is 0.2 % , [ according to dsm-5 ] . 
  that would be 1 in 500 people . 
  that is far higher than any actual physical issue . 
  how many are transgender i do not know , but should we indulge delusional people ? 
  i freely admit that there are physical issues that lead to gender confusion . 
  but , are they significant enough , and are society 's use of gender specific words harmful enough , that we should change everything to do with sex and gender ? 
   is negatively affected by your actions i do n't agree . 
  giving them a bad grade `` negatively '' affects them . 
  most people who assert they are the other sex are actually delusional . 
  should we indulge all delusions ? 
  was it the case here ? 
  a few people have extreme sensitivity to light . 
  should we turn off all the street lights for them ? 
  i believe that i am napoleon bonaparte . 
  do i get to stay at the ch\u00e2teau de malmaison ? 
  was that the case here ? 
  do you have a y chromosome ? 
  that 's pretty much the question . 
  not sure about that . 
  the poem has four stanzas , but i think only the first may be part of the anthem . 
  ... ok , after looking , this is from the third stanza , and is technically part of the anthem . 
  one point , though : the reference is not to us blood , but british blood . 
  reasonable people can disagree . 
  [ i 'm shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here !,

  with blackjack !, 
  and hookers !, 
  ok , thank you for that . 
  i do n't speak german , sorry . 
  what the fuck did i just watch ? 
   here , have a north korean propaganda video . 
  that was pretty funny , but the singer was a bit of an over the top parody . 
  i assume it was made by some far-right group ? 
  no , judges can not create law . 
  i 'm still looking for the original on that . 
  stories abound everywhere , but i have n't been able to find an actual law . 
  now , i 'm on a mission . 
  i think what people do n't understand is that anyone can file a suit for almost any reason . 
  most of them get thrown out by the courts . 
  also , we do n't really have a way to purge the legal code of no longer applicable laws . 
  and we really should . 
  the shooting whales story is a great example , but i 'm not sure it is actually true . 
  i have seen it claimed by california , tennessee , and kentucky , but no one can actually find it in a legal code . 
  they may be referring to [ this kentucky law . 
  ] ( http://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2010/title-70/chapter-4/part-1/70-4-109/ ) but , there are plenty of totally bizarre laws still on the books that are obsolete and ignored . 
  mostly at the state level . 
  my favorite is the alabama law that says it is illegal to wear a fake mustache in church , but only if it causes laughter . 
  or this kentucky one :  krs 436.600 no person shall sell , exchange , offer to sell or exchange , display , or possess living baby chicks , ducklings , or other fowl or rabbits which have been dyed or colored ; nor dye or color any baby chicks , ducklings , or other fowl or rabbits ; nor sell , exchange , offer to sell or exchange or to give away baby chicks , ducklings or other fowl or rabbits , under two ( 2 ) months of age in any quantity less than six ( 6 ),
