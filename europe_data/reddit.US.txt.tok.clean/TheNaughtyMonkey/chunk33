  italy ( $ 34.7 k ) gets a bit of a bump , still under mississippi , and japan is adjusted down a bit to just over mississippi ( $ 36.7 k ) . 
  the top income quintile in mississippi is [ 5.4 x the bottom . 
  ] ( http://scorecard.assetsandopportunity.org/latest/measure/state-income-quintiles-acs ) for italy , [ that number is 3.5 ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/italy/income-distribution ) and for japan [ it is also 5.4 x. 
  ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/japan/income-distribution ) [ edit : according to [ this source , ] ( https://knoema.com/ilc_pns4/inequality-of-income-distribution-s80-s20-income-quintile-share-ratio-source-silc?tsid=1000350 ) that ratio for italy is actually about 6.2 . ), 
  the us is a very wealthy country , and even the lowest income levels are comparable to the median in many other devloped countries . 
  the smallest gdp in the south would be mississippi , at $ 106 billion , or between slovakia and hungary . 
  i live in north carolina , which is about the same gdp as sweden . 
  again , not really . 
  yes , the brits did use smallpox as a weapon a couple of times . 
  the united states never did . 
  but , most of those deaths were no more intentional than the black death in europe . 
  well , not really . 
  no one really knows what the population of north america was before european settlement . 
  estimates vary wildly . 
  but , most of the deaths were not from battling with settlers , but from smallpox , which probably accounted for about 80 % of all the deaths . 
  this is sort of what i refer to when i say that europeans think they know about us history , but really do n't . 
  if you just want to look at actual war related deaths , the europeans killed way more native americans than the us people did . 
  did ** i ** kill anyone ? 
  no , my grandparents on my father 's side came from ireland in the 1910 's , and my mother was english . 
  i was n't even born int he us . 
  well , you are european , and you think you know about us history . 
  that comes from watching too much us tv and movies , and not reading enough books . 
  do n't take it personally , it is just about everyone in europe . 
  think they know about the us , but have a weirdly narrow view . 
  the conclusion that your opinion of the history of native americans has anything to do with wine ? 
  or are you talking some odd concept of culture being tied to a patch of dirt ? 
  no , idea . 
  it was your point , not mine . 
  i think you need to watch fewer movies , and read more books . 
  but , that is irrelevant to our discussion about wine , is n't it ? 
  nort sure how you define culture , as most of the original settlers of the americas were either here for 10 's of thousands of years , or were from europe . 
  ( yes , even from france . ), 
  but , the french have a real reputation for undeserved snobbery about their wine , to the point of denying that any other country can make good wine . 
  here , if you really want some background , read this wikipedia article about the [ judgement of paris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judgment_of_paris_ ( wine ) ), 
  rofl accustions of cultural arrogance . 
  from a brit !, 
  thank you , that made my day . 
  huge part of many cultures . 
  number of spanish speakers in spain : 47 million number of spanish speakers in the americas : 418 million, 
   the french people have been making wine for so long by that logic , the georgians would make the best wine , followed by the greeks and chinese . 
  i was using 2013 numbers , sry . 
  tx gdp is $ 1.414 trillion uk gdp is $ 2.678 trillion, 
  [ midges of europe ] ( https://phys.org/news/2015-07-europe-siberia-caucasian-populations-non-biting.html ), 
  ah , now that i have asked for these `` sources , '' you get nasty . 
  i wonder why . 
   because the us , allied with europe , has more political and economic power than any other nation in the history of the world . 
  well , frankly , we have that even without the eu . 
  and , it is not like we are particularly close economic allies , as the imbalance of tariff structure shows . 
  why do ** we ** have to secure your continent ? 
  are you somehow incapable ? 
  operate without restriction ? 
  no , that really is n't true , whether tariffs or anti-trust . 
  google almost pulled out of france , as it has such a problem with the right to be forgotten . 
  you may feel like a lapdog , but what does the average american get out of the relationship ? 
   the value the us gets is a widened sphere of influence around the world . 
  i see no value in that . 
  we have a wide sphere of influence anyway , and our trade alone with the eu is enough to justify our influence in europe . .  the alliances we have are what allows the us to maintain so many military bases at every corner of the globe . 
  yeah , that is n't a good thing . 
  if we see the need to have a base , we can sign a mutually agreeable treaty with that country . 
  so , we are still back at what is good for the us about nato ? 
  well , i was hoping for answers , but if you have a source that answers these questions , i would be interested to see it . 
  or , do you dispute any of the questions ? 
  why does the us pay for europe 's defense ? 
  why are european tariffs on us goods higher than us tariffs on european goods ? 
  how does the `` alliance '' with europe benefit the us ? 
  i see what europe gets out of it , but i do n't see what the us gets . 
  that is not a very good metric . 
  the better number is [ labor force participation  ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate ) us - 62.9 % ez - [ 57 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/labor-force-participation-rate ) oh , and [ also this . 
  ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=usd&amp;to=eur&amp;view=5y ), 
  lol, 
   `` we do not believe in bans and walls '' , but fences are a competely different matter . 
  actually , each country is allowed to decide what response is appropriate . 
  i do n't think nato is good for europe , especially if the eu wants to survive . 
  but , is not square !, 
  no , again , you need to read the entire conversation . 
  it was about women being attracted to rich and famous men , and letting them do whatever they want . 
  sorry , did n't vote for him . 
  but , i note your looking for a reason to devalue my comment . 
  if you read the transcript , it is obvious what he was saying . 
  well , if you accurately read what he said , women consent to being grabbed by the pussy of one is rich and famous . 
  does n't matter . 
  it is a clear layout of how trump negotiates . 
  yeah , sort of expected that . 
  intervention is good when it is to save you and yours , but terrible for anyone else . 
  i have no idea what your point is . 
  and we did n't reduce the number of nukes from 39k to 4k beacuse we love our fellow man . 
  it is irrelevant . 
  i know its cool to think of the us as a terrible force in the world , but it is n't . 
  its not perfect , its not omnisicient , its not omnipotent . 
  but , it generally works for good ends . 
  when china invades , they stay . 
  when the us invades , they turn power over to a democratically elected government , and then leave . 
  that is sort of the difference . 
  if you ca n't see it , then you ca n't see it . 
  not sure how you can believe that , as he frequently contradicts hemself . 
  unless you are one of thos people who thinks he is stupid , you should read the art of the deal . 
  everything he does comes out of that . 
  ok , again , did you read the 1965 document ? 
  the one that predates fracking ? 
  and no , the fracking chemicals are not the issue .
