  it is a very small fringe , that has no impact at all on the life of the overwhelming majority . 
  in the us , one is free to have objectionable ideas . 
  making martyrs out of these people only serves to confirm their silly rhetoric . 
  we do n't have thought police , we do n't have hate crimes . 
  those would be un-american . 
  people are as free to think and say whatever racist crap they want to say , and i want other people to be able to hear how ridiculous they sound . 
   especially in the religious white protestant demographic there 's a lot of this stuff . 
  oh , ffs no , there is n't . 
  there is a tiny fringe . 
  even if we are to believe that there are 200,000 active white supremicists in the us ( not breaking any laws , by the way ) , that is still only 0.0006 % of the population . 
  yes , they are wrong . 
  but , until they break a law , they have a right to be wrong . 
  wow . 
  i mean , seriously , wow . 
  you completely missed the entire election , did n't you ? 
  trump campaigned against the republican party establishment . 
  his cabinet is notable for bringing in a lot of washignton outsiders . 
  yes , you caould say they are us business establishment , but they are not washington political class establishemnt . 
  that was sort of the whole underlying theme of his campaign , btw . 
  no , you are incorrect . 
  the american right is anti- ** large ** government . 
  the republican party of recent times is not . 
  the american right recently rejected the republican party establishment to elect trump . 
   trump is not a small government advocate , no , that is [ incorrect . 
  ] ( http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts )  see the mexican wall ok , [ here it is . 
  ] ( http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4094092/images/o-border-wall-facebook.jpg )  the proposed muslim registry you mean like [ this registry ? 
  ] ( http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/obama-dumps-registry-immigrant-men-mostly-muslims/ )  open admiration for torture well , you have a point on that one . 
  but , waterboarding has now been ruled illegal by us courts , so he would have to get congress to pass a law to change that . 
   and do n't tell me that there is not a huge base of white supremacy in the us . 
  there is [ not a huge base of white supremency in the us . 
  ] ( http://people.missouristate.edu/michaelcarlie/storage/white_supremacist_groups.htm ) around 25k is the highest estimates . 
  out of a population of 324 million , that is 0.00007 % . 
  nope , did n't vote for trump . 
  he called you out for deceptively editing quotes to change their meaning . 
  you do n't get to claim victim-hood . 
  fascism requires the rejection of democracy 2 . 
  fascism emphasizes violence for its own sake 3 . 
  fascism is anti-individualist 4 . 
  fascism does n't really have much to do with economics 5 . 
  there are n't that many real fascists left http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/10/9886152/donald-trump-fascism, 
  you just got owned . 
  and , its telling that your repsonse to his valid criticisms is to insult him , and grasp for reasons to attack his right to speak . 
  stop trying to impose fascism on the us . 
  it just does n't fit . 
  we no more have fascism than europe has libertarianism . 
  our right-wing is anti-government . 
  you ca n't build an authoritarian state out of a bunch of small government advocates . 
  also , we have a constitution that denies certain powers to government . 
  trumnp himself is dedicated to reducing the number of people in government ( 20 % ) and government budget ( 10 % ) , as well as reining in our military actions overseas . 
  this constant sqawking about trump is a fascist just shows an ignorance of trump , of fascism , and the us . 
  there is plenty to criticise , and i am sure he will do infuriating things . 
  but , the us is not europe , and imposing european political concepts on the us is just silly . 
  i am aware of the overseas territories , i just do n't count them . 
  well , it does , actually . 
  i do n't think the us will leave nato , but that is immaterial to the question . 
  is turkey in europe ? 
  but , some of us do n't ** want ** global hegemony . 
  its expensive . 
  and everyone hates us . 
  that is not my intention , and i am sorry if i was unclear . 
  i am asking europeans how they feel about the us being the dominant component of european defense ? 
  all i can say , after decades of trump , is pay little attention to what he says , and careful attention to what he does , and how he does it . 
  do you think the huge us influence on european defense is good or bad for europe ? 
  no , overall spending is a bad metric . 
  the us may have excellent equipment , but due to the way it is purchased it is way , way overpriced . 
  also , us troops are paid more than , say chinese troops . 
  % gdp is a measure of relative importance of defense spending , not how effectively the money is spent . 
  if you feel comfortable with that , then that is what is important . 
  but remember what stalin said , `` quantity has a quality all its own . '', 
  i do n't mind the tone . 
  it was an honest question , and you gave an honest answer . 
  military strength from [ global firepower.com ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) 1 0.0897 - united states of america ( north america ; nato ) 2 0.0964 - russia ( asia ) 3 0.0988 - china ( asia ) 4 0.1661 - india ( asia ) 5 0.1993 - france ( europe ; nato ; eunion ) 6 0.2164 - united kingdom ( europe ; nato ; eunion ) 7 0.2466 - japan ( asia ) 8 0.2623 - turkey ( asia ; middle east ; nato ) 9 0.2646 - germany ( europe ; nato ; eunion ) 10 0.2724 - italy ( europe ; nato ; eunion ) 11 0.2824 - south korea ( asia ), 
  again , why the us does or does not want to be in europe is not my question . 
  do europeans feel that the current situation , with the us military being such a large part of european defense , is good or what they desire ? 
  i think that europeans should wait and see what trump does . 
  i live in the us , and i do n't know what he will do , so any european guesses are not really useful . 
  that is n't my question . 
  how do you feel , as a european , depending so much on a country outside europe for your defense ? 
  would you be happier if the us was not such a dominant force in nato ? 
   and yeah , i 'm pretty sure trump will also meddle in the brexit negotiations which also worries me because i think that it will screw up the eu-uk relation even more than it 's already screwed up . 
  i actually doubt he will . 
  obama certainly did , on the pro side . 
  i strongly suspect that trump will be much more domesticalyl focussed than obama . 
  i know trump is new to europeans , but we have known about the guy for decades . 
  he is brash , loud , classless and vain . 
  but , he is not stupid , racist , or aggressive . 
  hmm , now you made me look . 
  active military personnel russia - 776k ( army ) poland - 101k ( 79k army ) uk - 153k ( 153k army ) france - 209k ( 112k army ) tanks russia - 15,398 poland - 1,000 france - 493 uk - 407 attack aircraft ( fixed wing + helicopters ) russia - 1,916 poland - 128 france - 332 uk - 212, 
  thank you for the post . 
  well , a fighter is not a bomber , max operation distance is not combat radius , and russian aircraft have in-flight refueling capabilities . 
  no , in my scenario the french air force has to fly to the eastern part of the eu , and the airfields there , which would be the first things bombed by the russians . 
  the overfunding is in comparison to other nato members . 
  forward air bases are generally considered first strike targets for that reason . 
  the distance from france to tripoli was under 2000 km . 
  forward airbases are considerd prime targets , and are generally considered to be at high risk in any attack . 
  i do n't disagree at all . 
  but , my question was about how europeans felt regarding the large presence of the us in european defense . 
  was n't number of bombs , but inability to fly the distance without us refueling . 
  yes , but the eu is much larger than that . 
  so , those air forces can not operate across the eu wothout outside support .
