  second largest manufacturing economy in the world ( 17.4 % of world manufacturing ) . 
  europe makes a lot of luxury goods . 
  that , and pharmaceuticals .

  us is a net importer . 
  so , anyone who has a positive balance of trade with the us would end up being the ones hurt . 
  as this would increase the costs of imports , the primary beneficiary would be domestic us manufacturers . 
  us dropped 2.5 % from 2014 to 2015 . 
  eu increased by 0.7 %, 
  the eu has a trade surplus of about $ 120 billion per year with the us . 
  about half that from germany . 
  so , nick , good luck with that . 
  better check with angie , first . 
  no , my petty attempts at being an asshole aare almost embarrassing , given how exceptional some people ( yourself included ) are . 
  and do n't worry about my healthcare . 
  like the overwhelming majority of americans , i have great health insurance . 
  in fact , i live a couple of miles from one of the premier research hospitals in the world . 
  sadly , being an american , i do n't really care about your healthcare . 
  i have more important things to do . 
  yes , assholes tend to be expert in butt maintenance . 
  you 're an asshole !, 
  why did n't you just say that in the first place ? 
  yeah , this is a good place for assholes . 
  lot 's of asshole cameraderie going on . 
  i 'm just a stupid american , but i am reasonably sure that smoked salmon is not a cheese . 
  oh , and you might find [ this interesting . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wisconsin-cheese-world-championship_us_56e2d4a5e4b065e2e3d59576 ) do n't give up though , we ** are ** still very fat . 
  people 's feeling are personal . 
  i am just talking about actual actions . 
  oh , your impression is whatever it is . 
  i am just pointing out that he has not actually done anything negative for lgbtq . 
  has the military banned transgender individuals ? 
  yes , as i keep repeating , trump says all sorts of contradictory shit . 
  ( oh , and as commander in chief the decision to ban tg individuals lies with him alone . 
  he does not need any congressional approval . 
  if he really wanted them banned , they would be banned . ) ), 
  well , except they ** have n't ** banned transexuals from the military , have they ? 
  actually , he made a point of not removing anti-discrimination laws . 
  plenty of reasons to be unhappy with him , do n't have to make them up . 
  but when he does , he is fab-u-lous !, 
  yes , as i say , trump says all sorts of things , many of them contradictory . 
  but , what has he actually done ? 
  well , no , he is n't like pence . 
  he chose pence to appeal to the more conservative side of the republican party . 
  trump is an ass , but he is a fairly moderate ass . 
   they saw their own benefits in doing so . 
  by detering the soviet expansion america remained the largest power in the world . 
  you are assuming your conclusion . 
  the us , which had just donated billions of dollars of aid into europe ( [ marshall plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan ) ) , did not want to see europe fall back into war , or be overrun by the soviet union . 
  the prevailing feeling at the time in the us was that communism flourished in poverty . 
  `` political debt ? '', 
  no idea what that is . 
  do you actually think that european countries are not self-ruling , and merely follow the us blindly ? 
  you have to read newspapers of the time to understand the feeling of the populace . 
  you might be surprised , but the us was very , very much agaisnt getting involved in ww2 in europe . 
  if `` the war to end all wars '' did not stop the eternal european war , the feeling was , nothing would . 
  i really do n't get to annoyed any more at this weird need to minimise what the us did for europe all through the 20th century . 
  i certainly do n't claim that europe owes us anything . 
  but , the ignorance of history is rather appalling , just from an educational viewpoint . 
  rofl i assume you ca n't link to comedy central 's the daily show . 
  if not , here , [ try this link .

  are you really going to make me defend trump ? 
  that 's just mean . 
  in fact , he has done nothing negative to lgbtq people . 
  yes , he has said some shit , but he says all sorts of shit . 
  but , iof you just want to point at things he has said :  `` as your president , i will do everything in my power to protect our lgbtq citizens from the violence and oppression of the hateful foreign [ islamic extremism ] ideology . '', 
  - acceptance speech at republican convention or [ this .

   `` president donald j. trump is determined to protect the rights of all americans , including the lgbtq community . 
  president trump continues to be respectful and supportive of lgbtq rights , just as he was throughout the election , '' the white house announced in a statement . 
   `` the president is proud to have been the first ever gop nominee to mention the lgbtq community in his nomination acceptance speech , pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression , '' it said . 
  now i have to go take a shower . 
  thanks for that !, 
  no , we really did n't take it the modern us foreign policy has its roots in the decision to stay in europe after ww2 , for two reasons : 1 ) deter the sovet expansion , and 2 ) to prevent another european war . 
  no , we do n't make our business their 's . 
  it is , to an american ( even one who has lived in europe ) bizzarre how the most mundane domestic issues are objects of non-stop discussion for europeans . 
  it really is a little like having a stalker , sometimes . 
  we only inherited the title because europe could n't go 30 years without trying to massacre each other . 
  us used to be almost isolationist . 
  frankly , i think a lot of the people would like to go back to that time , and stop dicking around in every other country in the world . 
  that was pretty cool . 
  but , is kaliningrad really a piece of shit ? 
   gay acceptance in the us is on a terrible level compared to europe huh ? 
  what do you base that on ? 
  i have no idea why some europeans are so fixated on the united states . 
  it 's like having a stalker . 
  sort of creepy . 
  ( who , in fact , is far more pro-lgbtq than any other republican i can think of . ), 
  yes , i counted like for like : cases reported to doctors . 
  the eu data does not give an unreported estimate . 
  http://grocery.harristeeter.com/pd/harris-teeter/eggs/1-doz/072036632159/ my local grocery store . 
  do you have anything more recent ? 
  and my response was that both statistics were doctor confirmed cases . 
  unless you can provide some evidence that the definition of salmonellosis is different between the eu and us ( which i personally highly doubt ) , we have to believe that the diagnosis criteria are the same . 
  ppp or exchange rate ? 
  no , you need to read the articles . 
  `` 15.5 laboratory-confirmed infections per 100,000 population '' `` confirmed salmonellosis cases '' unless you have some non-labortory way to confirm a salmonellosis case ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  if you read into the data provided , they actually try to estimate how many cases there are overall .
