  less than 10 % of the us does not have health insurance . 
  the reported differnce os over 30 % . 
  intersting , then , to compare the relative rates of salmonella . 
  [ us ( from cdc )  ( https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6253a1.htm )  in 2013 , the incidence of salmonellosis in the united states was 15.5 laboratory-confirmed infections per 100,000 population , eu ( european food safety authority , page 4 )  in 2013 , a total of 82,694 confirmed salmonellosis cases were reported by 27 eu ms , resulting in an eu notification rate of 20.4 cases per 100,000 population . 
  i just think its funny that , with the internet literally at yuour fingertips , so few people actually stop to look things up . 
  fair point . 
  subsidised housing , negative income tax , food assistance , etc. 
  all of those would have to be factored in as well . 
  that is 2.7 % of hourly paid workers . 
   in 2016 , 79.9 million workers age 16 and older in the united states were paid at hourly rates , representing 58.7 percent of all wage and salary workers . 
  without some sort of ppp comparison , that is n't useful . 
  also , how many people work for minimum wage ? 
  in the us , that is about [ 1.6 % of workers . 
  ] ( https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2016/home.htm ), 
  and then the germans invaded . 
  i am not talking about national pride , but just the facts of the matter . 
  this type of invasion would never happen , because greece has strong allies , and could resist long enough for those allies to assist . 
  there is no glory in war . 
  patriots die just like everyone else . 
  the best way to win a war is to not have one in the first place . 
  well , this is a hypothetical , and not a very likely one . 
  i suspect that turkey could never `` take over '' greece , as the terrain and population work against them ( as happened in ww2 ) . 
  but , in the sort of army on army battle we rarely see , i think the turks would prevail . 
  of course , we are leaving out greece 's allies . 
  so , could greece hold off the turks long enough for allies to come in ? 
  i think so , yes . 
  i do n't see this ever happening . 
  it 's a no win for turkey , just erdogan blustering, 
   regardless of the rank in these websites , turkey is not as high as you think it is . 
  well , i disagree . 
  these are websites that evaluate the overall ** effectiveness ** of militaries . 
  and the disparity between turkey and greece is not small . 
  turkey is considered to have the 8th most powerul military . 
  greece is 28th . 
  note the disparity of transport aircraft ( both plane and helicopter ) , and the force projection that entails . 
  http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&amp;country1=turkey&amp;country2=greece&amp;submit=compare not very close at all . 
  [ turkey v. greece ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&amp;country1=turkey&amp;country2=greece&amp;submit=compare ) [ turkey v. bulgaria ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&amp;country1=turkey&amp;country2=bulgaria&amp;submit=compare ) let 's just point out that turkey has the 8th most powerful military in the world . 
  greece 28 , and bulgaria67 . 
  do n't even waste time trying . 
  superiority to the us is shibboleth on this sub-reddit . 
  after checking , you are correct . 
  us flights cost more per seat mile . 
  seats are dependant on the airline , not manufacturer . 
  interestingly , the largest fleet of a320s is american airlines . 
  so , in the us , both sources are used . 
  the airlines have a strong vested interest in having two competing manufacturers . 
  so , for instance , american airlines is the largest operator of a320 and a321 aiplanes in the world , and second largest operator of a319s . 
  if you only ever buy from one manufacturer , its sort of hard to price shop them against the other . 
  one reason why flying is so cheap in the us . 
  ( edit : it is n't . ), 
  if falcon heavy can regularly reuse boosters , it will drive the price down to the point where no one else can compete , unless on a political basis . 
  i completely agree . 
  let 's see how falcon heavy does in the launch this autumn . 
   erroneously think that europe is overrun with muslims . 
  it seems to be more of a european opinion than an american one . 
  i thought it was because europe constantly complains about being overrun with muslims ?

  oh , i 'm not criticising . 
  it 's your country , and your courts . 
  no one else 's business . 
  i was just explaining the post . 
  no , i do n't think i would . 
  324 million people . 
  you may find one or two that have read it , but no significant number . 
  1515 pages ? 
  the unabomber 's manifesto was only about 150 pages . 
  i think there is a disconnect with the post you responded to . 
  while i am sure he is treated the same as anyone else who may have killed 77 people , that post was more talking about his treatment compared to what it would have been in other countries with stricter penalties . 
  by the standards of many other countries , his prison is not that bad . 
  did n't even know he had a manifesto . 
  < looks  it is all about europe . 
  doubt that any americans really care . 
  `` justice is blind '' means that all people are treated equally . 
  does n't really refer to the relative severity of a country 's sentences . 
  harry potter land, 
  deployed , but not yet on a ship . 
  well , not really based on the hornet . 
  the article i linked goes into it , but the super hornet is a larger aircraft with a different wing . 
  i only mean limited in the number that can be carried . 
  yes , in service . 
  https://www.navytimes.com/articles/naval-air-station-lemoore-gets-first-f35c-fighters  the super etendard has been retired from service i did n't know that . 
  ( checking ) exactly a year ago . 
  sorry about that . 
  so , rafale m is now both the strike and fighter aircraft . 
  the super hornet is a [ completely different plane than the hornet . 
  ] ( https://fightersweep.com/5334/ask-fighter-pilot-hornet-vs-super-hornet/ ) boeing gave it the same designation to reassure the navy of parts availability . 
  i was just supplying a third party view , not french or us . 
  but , the super hornet is being replaced by the f35c , which is a far more capable aircraft altogether . 
  the rafale m is a great multi-role plane , probably one of the best gen 4.5 . 
  it is a little limited in a carrier role , as the delta wing can not be folded up . 
  but , stealth is a real game changer . 
  remember what the us policy is about fair fights . 
  `` never get in one . '', 
  and sweden . 
  well , the us does not buy a metric shitload of europand weapons , but we do buy a lot . 
   anti-tank missiles and bofors cannon from sweden , the m1a1 tank 's main gun from germany , bae systems sells a few billions of dollars , standard us pistol is a beretta , etc. . . 
  the f35b is the vertical landing variant . 
  it can land almost anywhere . 
  i believe you are referring to the f35c , the carrier variant . 
  which can certainly land on the cdg .
