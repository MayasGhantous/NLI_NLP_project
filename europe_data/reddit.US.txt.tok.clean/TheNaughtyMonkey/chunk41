  ( an f/a -18 has landed and taken off from the cdg . ), 
  edit : i was the one who confused the - b and - c models . 
   f-35c the first ones have already been delivered . 
  as of february , 10 out of the 67 ordered have been delivered . 
  the french are currently flying the rafale m , a mid-1990 's design , and super entenards , a early 70 's design . 
  they can techncially handle the standard us navy fighter/strike aircraft , the f/a -18 super hornet ( designed in the mid 90 's ) . 
  so , comparing the rafale m to the [ super hornet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_f/a-18e/f_super_hornet ) , no , i do n't think anyone at all would say the rafale is superior in any way , even before you factor in that the f/a -18 is a fighter and a strike aircraft . 
  has france or germany built any stealthy aircraft yet ? 
  first us stealth aircraft was designed 26 years ago . 
  that is a lot of catching up to do . 
  it 's sort of what we do . 
  oh , and bad movies . 
  we do that . 
  and software . 
  umm , bbq ? 
  oh , the states have problems , but they are a little different because states can not run a deficit . 
  most of the state problems have to do with unfunded public pensions . 
  no us state has gone bankrupt since the 1840 's . 
  i do n't * think * any state has ever been bailed out by the federal government , but i am not 100 % sure . 
  us states are not allowed to run a deficit , so its a very poor comparison . 
  what freedom of speech ? 
  reddit is a private entity , and can allow or disallow anything it wants . 
  yes , it operates from the us , so has some speech protections from government intrusion , but that is a different matter . 
  i graduated into a terrible job market . 
  but , i did n't have a lot of debt , as the tuitions and fees were not as high as today . 
  i am involved in hiring for my company , and we have a real problem finding people that have made the transition from telling us what they deserve , to actually being willing to do hard work . 
  in fact , we now recruit almost exclusively from military veterans . 
  yes , the skill level is relevant . 
  is babysitting a skilled job ? 
  is flipping burgers a skilled job ? 
  if not , why do you expect they would pay as well as a skilled job ? 
   you ca n't undermine arts and everything that is n't relevant to how american capitalism gone awry has geared itself . 
  there 's more to life than being the cogs to a machine that views itself as infinite and limitless . 
  western europe understands this and makes effort to pay livable wages and prevent their markets from becoming nothing more than mega-conglomerate monopolies to keep the super rich super rich . 
  not sure what the first sentence means . 
  and if you do n't want to work for the man , that is your choice . 
  but , if you do n't work , do n't expect much in the way of pay . 
  also , western europe has far , far higher youth unemployment than the us . 
  well , do you want welfare , or jobs ? 
  do n't confuse the two . 
   but , if that person was working a full time amount of hours , they deserve a living off of it . 
  i am a terrible painter . 
  if i work full time , painting shitty watercolors , do i `` deserve '' to be paid for that ? 
  a person 's labor is worth what someone will pay them for it . 
  no more . 
  if you force employers to pay more for the labor than they can get in productivity , they will not hire the worker . 
  a degree in french literature is a fine thing , but it does not mean that anyone wants to pay for that knowledge . 
  all labor is not equally valuable . 
  it is sad that so many college students go into debt to acquire degrees that are of little value in the workplace , but that was their decision . 
  now , if you are saying that 18 year olds are not capable of making those decisions , and should not be signing those loans , i think you have a strong case to make . 
  no one `` deserves '' any money . 
  we , as a society , have programs to give money and benefits to those who can not support themselves . 
  but , that is not work , but social charity . 
  so , you only support a high minimum wage for full time workers ? 
  did you notice the part of that report that talked about hours being cut ? 
  if you only have to pay the $ 15 for fulltime workers , companies will just hire two part time workers , and not have to pay them $ 15 / hour . 
  you must be a terrible waiter . 
  no one else in this thread who does so would agree with you . 
  sorry , but if you are only making minimum wage as a waiter , you are doing very , very poorly . 
  artificially high minimum wages are not a new idea . 
  anytime you move away from a market price you introduce artificialites and distortions . 
  should babysitters be paid a `` living wage ? '', 
  you ca n't just arbitrarily set wages . 
  we have seen that in the past , and it leads to all sorts of problems . 
  just look at what a high minimum wage [ has done to seattle . 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/26/new-study-casts-doubt-on-whether-a-15-minimum-wage-really-helps-workers/ ) waiting tables is unskilled labor , and is one of the best paying unskilled labor jobs out there . 
  fuck you , then . 
  have you ever worked for tips in the us ? 
  or , are you just pulling crap out of your ass ? 
  no , i am not dishonest . 
  apology , or we are done . 
  https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/02/how-much-do-waiters-really-earn-in-tips/385515/ https://www.quora.com/on-average-how-much-do-food-servers-make-per-hour-including-tips http://work.chron.com/much-money-average-waitress-make-per-month-22289.html `` as far as you know '' is the problem here . 
  you dont ' actually know anything about the issue . 
  have you ever worked as a waiter or waitress in the us ? 
  have you ever worked in the us for tips ? 
  please let me know where and when that was . 
  failing that , i can only assume that you are speaking from total ignorance of the issue . 
  yes , if you have $ 1,000 in expenses per month , and you are not making even the median income claimed by waters/waitresses ( about $ 2,000 ) , then you either need to find a job you are better at , or reduce your expenses . 
  in places where they have tried to get rid of tips , it has not worked out very well . 
   i 'm only attacking the fact that the tip being paid is used by many restaurant owners not to pay the federal minimal wage and what every american keeps repeating is that the salary component of a waitstaff 's income is miniscule compared to what they get in tips . 
  who cares about the $ 2.13 when you are actually making around $ 25 ? 
   from personal experience , if the `` tipped minimal wage '' is 2 $ , you can only expect 2 $ / hour plus the occasional 10 $ / 20 $ a day or two per month . 
  if you are only making $ 10-20 twice a month , you must be such an incredibly bad waiter that you really need to look for other work . 
  in fact , i do n't believe that anyone in the us is making that tiny an amount of money from waiting tables . 
  again , ask any waiter or waitress in the us if they want to change the tipping system . 
  they will tell you they do not . 
  yup , about 30 years ago . 
  and no , with inflation that [ would be about $ 4.70 per hour . 
  ] ( https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm ) but , as the price of the meals has kept up with inflation , and you are making the overwhelming majority of your money from a percentage of that , the real income for waiters and waitresses has done a very good job of keeping pace with inflation . 
   and how do they even pay the lawyers or prove they did n't received the tips the restaurant declared they got lol ? 
  they file a bls greivance , which costs nothing . 
   i 'd bet the republicans encouraged to destroy that data to argue in favor of lowering the minimal wage ; but that 's probably just my paranoia talking . 
  do n't know about paranoia , but certianly ignorance of the issue . 
  no , not 2k $ / month . 
  i said $ 2,000 per month . 
  ask anyone in the us who works for tips if they wish to change the system . 
   the employer can dock most of your pay if you `` make enough '' tips ; they do n't have to pay a full minimal wage no , that is inaccurate . 
  they can offset the $ 2.13 per hour in some places , but only if you are making so much that it is irrelevant . 
  a typical server might make about $ 8.00 in wages in a shift , but $ 75 in tips . 
  the $ 2.13 is almost inconsequntial .
