  there is a lot of ignorance of the us healthcare system here , but it does not stop people opining about it . 
  for example , i have lived in europe , and i would not trade my healthcare for what is available in the places i lived . 
  however , it is access to healthcare that is a problem in the us . 
  we spend a lot of money , to little effect . 
  also , i strongly suspect that spain is not providing these services to illegal aliens who make up about 3-4 % of the population . 
  ( which for spain would be about 2 million people ) . 
  calm down . 
  not everything is dick waving , and understanding something is rather the first step to being able to discuss it in any meaningful way . 
   based on your argument they should have no benefits whatsoever . 
  where did i make that argument ? 
  ah , so it is some sort of dick waving . 
  sorry , not interested . 
  our healthcare system is a mess , but i 'm not interested in talking to people who do n't really want to know about it , and just want to wave dicks . 
  6 bullet points on spanish flyer . 
  5 are the same in the us , and the 6th is mostly the same . 
  is that simple enough for you ? 
  or , are you so vested in your beliefs about the us that you are n't really interested in facts that might make you question them ? 
  well , universal healthcare is not paid by all citizens , but by those citizens who pay taxes . 
  in the us , for instacne , almost half of peopel pay no income tax . 
  government largesse can be modified or withdrawn as easily as any other benefit . 
  you are arguing semantics . 
  what is the difference between charity , and a government service you do not pay for ? 
  no , you need to reread that . 
  i was referring to post-natal . 
  you may need to read beynd the first page if you are looking for that level of detail . 
  remember , in the us , a lot of this is paid for and administered at the state level . 
   and is it even free for the us one ? 
  well , typically it is paid for by the state , who then tries to get reimbursed by the federal government . 
  but `` free '' in that the patient does not pay ? 
  yes . 
   does n't this imply it 's not free , but rather that the us government subsidise it to some degree ? 
  what coverage there is , is paid for by the state/federal government . 
   except in those states that do not regard immigration status as a bar to receipt of pre-natal services . 
  currently , `` non-qualified immigrants are eligible for pre-natal care in 9 states ( ca , il , mi , mo , ne , ri , sd , wa , and wi ) plus washington d.c. '' ca alone is about 25 % of the category . 
  plus , there are other avanues to that care , as seen below . 
  you are the one who did n't read the paper because it was too long . 
  if you want a spcific discussion of pre-natal care , [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://undocumentedpatients.org/issuebrief/undocumented-immigrants-in-the-united-states-access-to-prenatal-care/ ) as to the 6 other types of care listed in op 's post , all are covered in most of the us except the post-natal care , which is covered in parts of the us . 
  pre-natal care is available almost anywhere , under the various programs in the link above . 
  well , universal healthcare could be provided by a charity , but in general , it is n't . 
  for instance , in some states [ over a third of all hospital beds ] ( https://www.aclu.org/map/percentage-hospital-beds-catholic-hospitals-2016 ) are operated by the catholic church . 
   universal healthcare is not charity - it 's an efficient market . 
  um , no , it is sort of the opposite of an efficient market . 
  some people choose not to put any money into healthcare in the us ( even though the aca made this illegal ) . 
  that is a market decision . 
  the biggest problem is trying to turn the us health ** insurance ** industry into a healthcare industry . 
  and , yes , it is extremely inefficient . 
  ( there are other reasons , too , such as the simply ridiculous [ administrative costs ] ( http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/administrative-costs-are-killing-us-healthcare ) in the us . ), 
   healthcare pools are much more efficient with full participation . 
  absolutely agree . 
  but , the current law actually makes it more financially responsible to not pay for any insurance until you have need of it , and only then get a policy . 
  our entire system is filled with perverse incentives like that . 
  interestingly , the first firehouses ** were ** privately operated with the proceeds of fire insurance . 
  and , in the us , about 70 % of all firefighters are volunteers . 
  we have a different history of these things than most of europe . 
  that was in response to the statement :  why the hell do my fellow americans hate the idea of helping one another and having good healthcare ? 
  which is incorrect . 
  in fact , as the attached pdf shows ( in great detail ) the only difference between the op 's spanish rules of healthcare to illegal aliens and the us 's , is that some states do not provide the same levels of post-natal care to illegal aliens . 
  fair enough , but individual charity can also be to an organised provate charity , which addresses that issue . 
  the us is odd in a lot of ways , but one of them is that our private charity is always some multiples of our government charity . 
  we choose to use other conduits to give aid to those who need it . 
  [ medicare should leverage buying power to pull down drug prices , white house says ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/02/07/513945538/white-house-says-medicare-should-leverage-its-buying-power-to-pull-down-drug-pri ), 
   we should force people yeah , you lost me there . 
  i 'm rather stubbornly anti-authoritarian . 
   private charity does n't have the same influence as state organized fundings . 
  i agree . 
  in most places , it has more influence ( effect ) than state funding . 
  how about just read the introduction , on page 2 . 
  enforced collective charity is not superior to voluntary , individual charity . 
  in fact , as voluntary charity is directed by the donor , they have a more personal interest in directing that money to the most effective delivery of the service . 
  the us , for instance , is a country of very high individual charity . 
   there are law in place that makes it harder for the government to operate because otherwise it would unfairly compete with the open market . 
  not in the us , there are n't . 
  and , the huge amounts of government regulation over private healthcare have effectively turned it into the worst combination of private and public . 
  yes , i think that healthcare provision should be a government interest . 
  whether that means a national health service like france or the uk , or a public/private partnership like german or the netherlands is open to discussion . 
  but , in the us , an nhs would be a ** huge ** redefining of the role of government . 
  and , as i said , in those places where the government has the most control over healthcare provision , the results are simply unacceptable . 
  given the us economy , if there is some way that competition among providers can be maintained , that has historically resulted in the lowest cost for high service . 
  you completely missed the point of the quote . 
  the overall system ** is ** government run . 
  they also have problems over at the veterans administration hospiatls with administrators lying on their records , which led to peple dying . 
  not sure what the problem is , but lack of any accounibility seems to be part of it . 
  well , you also tend to overlook that the us does have a single-payer system that covers over 70 million people . 
  it is enormously expensive , has a 10 % fraud rate , and is causing many doctors to leave their practices . 
  i would have no problem with a european style system , if our government could display any aptitude in running one . 
  http://library.niwap.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/pdf/pb-man-ch17.4-prenatalcare.pdf maybe because we actually know something about the issue , and you evidently do n't ? 
  as to helping one another :  `` there is no virtue in compulsory government charity , and there is no virtue in advocating it . 
  a politician who portrays himself as `` caring '' and `` sensitive '' because he wants to expand the government 's charitable programs is merely saying that he 's willing to try to do good with other people 's money . 
  well , who is n't ? 
  and a voter who takes pride in supporting such programs is telling us that he 'll do good with his own money -- if a gun is held to his head . '', 
  correct-ish , but there are even more exceptions . 
  but , you are the closest to correct , so have an up-boat . 
  no , not true . 
  edit : ok http://library.niwap.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/pdf/pb-man-ch17.4-prenatalcare.pdf, 
  yes , mostly . 
  some states do n't provide free post-partum care , unless it is an emergency . 
  yeah , we tend to suck at administering these large social programs . 
  us provides more single payer healthcare than the nih . 
  we just do it really badly .
