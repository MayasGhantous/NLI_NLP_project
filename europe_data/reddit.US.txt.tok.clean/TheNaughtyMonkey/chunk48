  this is the 4th time i am asking , but why is it so important to you that you not be considered a european country ? 
   what you think makes britain so culturally european government , relationship between people and state , shared history ( most importantly ww1 and ww2 ) , shared artistic tradition , shared religious history , very similiar attitudes toward religion currently , similiar economies , propinquity , etc. . 
  i have lived in australia , italy , france , the uk , and the us , and spent significant time in switzerland . 
  i feel i am just repeating myslef . 
  while you may not feel a strong bond to europe , everyone else in the world considers the uk to be a european country . 
  the only question is why that seems to be such an issue for some english . 
  i lived there , and i have no idea . 
  well , some people refer to the anglosphere , but that is not a replacement for european . 
  yes , it is a shared language , and a shared colonial past , but its sort of like thinking that the phillipines and cuba are culturally related , because both speak spanish . 
  also , remember that , while eastern canada and us are highly euro-influenced ( and uk influenced ) , as you go further west , you see much less of that . 
  as i pointed out earlier , most of the central part of the us was settled by german and nordic immigrants , who do not feel that same relationship to the uk . 
  i understand that you do not `` feel '' european , but all i can say is that from the outside , the uk has much more in common with the rest of europe than it is different . 
  switzerland is certainly a little different from the rest of europe , but do you consider them `` european ? '', 
   you 're lying !, 
  and we are done . 
  come back when you can discuss things like a big boy . 
  well you are of course entitled to your opinion . 
  i am just pointing out that it is not shared outside of england . 
  sorry , i feel bad that you put so much work into a reply , and i just do n't see it changing the fact that just about everyone on earth considers the uk to be a european country , except some people in england . 
  well , did i say that the uk and india were part of the same culture ? 
  becuase i do not see me saying anything like that . 
  i have actually lived in the uk , and in italy . 
  yes , they are both culturally european . 
  in case you did not know , both were part of the roman empire , in fact . 
  i have no idea why you resist this so strongly . 
  if you are british , you are european . 
  you share history , culture , a lot of language , geography , etc. 
  you can protest ( i assume you will ) but i am just telling you what the rest of the world thinks . 
  look , within europe , you guys have very compex relations with each other . 
  we ( the rest of the world ) get that . 
  but , from the outside , looking in , the uk is a european country . 
  it is simply more similiar to other european countries than it is different . 
  from the very european type of statism , to the shared history and culture , we just consider the uk part of europe . 
  everyone does . 
  its not that you are identical to other european countries , but there is a sort of cultural range that we perceive as european , that the uk comnforably fits into . 
  as i said to the other poster , we do n't understand why that is such a point of contention . 
  i have lived in england , and i do n't understand it . 
   how much eastern european culture does it actually have ? 
  the us is n't poor and communist and as far as i know you guys do n't put sugar or custard on potatoes . 
  dpends where you are . 
  parts of texas are very czech , chicago is hugely polish . 
  even baltimore has an enormous ukranian community . 
  i put the uk and italy in the same catagory because they are a shared culture . 
  they have far much more in common than differnences , comapred to other countries around the world i simply do not understand why it is so important to some english to self-identify as not being european . 
  its just one of those things that i do n't think anyone outside england understands ( and i have even lived there . ), 
  well , could not any country in europe say that it has a `` very distinct culture ? '', 
  is france european ? 
  is germany ? 
  do they have distinct cultures ? 
  when i say the us is european , i include western and eastern . 
  the us saw huge immigration waves from [ eastern europe , mostly jewish and polish .

  [ this is a very interesting map ] ( http://blogs.voanews.com/all-about-america/2014/12/19/people-of-german-ancestry-dominate-us-melting-pot/ ) showing the prevailing ancestry of americans across the country . 
  is european too broad a catagory ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  compared to the various asian , middle eastern , african , south american , etc cultures , european cultures are very similiar to each other . 
  did n't need a flag . 
  it 's the almost unique combination of arrogance and ignorance that tells the world that you are a very specific type of english person . 
  genetically ? 
  well , as the [ decendants of the european immigrants are becoming the minority in the country ] ( https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/07/06/its-official-the-us-is-becoming-a-minority-majority-nation ) , i 'd say that we are less and less european every day . 
  up to now , i would say the us is a european based culture , though . 
  no , you do n't have your own culture . 
  you are a result of the general european culture , as opposed to asian , south american , etc. . . 
  your genetics are european . 
  your language is germanic ( with strong french influences ) . 
  you are 30 miles from your nearest european neighbor . 
  i just find this resistance by some english to the idea that they are european to be simaltaneously funny , and puzzling . 
  no , the uk is part of europe , is [ culturally european ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_of_europe ) , [ genetically european ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_history_of_europe ) , geographically european ( yes , [ part of the euroasian plate ] ( http://cdn.tourismontheedge.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/tectonic-gap-europe-and-uni.jpg ) ) , and is , in every way , a country in europe . 
  i find this resistance from certain brits fascinating , and amusing . 
  and then people accuse the us of exceptionalism !, 
  you can stop now . 
  i already know you are english . 
  oh , i do n't care . 
  i am sure you think you know what we feel in my country better than i do . 
  not your mate , and it is n't `` advice . '', 
  it is an observation from my country, 
  who , the kiwis ? 
  pretty sure they are not british . 
  and not in europe . 
  huh ? 
  you are almost indistinguishable from the rest of europe , from this side of the atlantic . 
  i have had british people argue with me when i called them `` european . '', 
  edit : in fact , two of those arguments are going on right now , in this thread . 
  arab is not really a nationality , but an ethnicity . 
  why do you assume i have not consumed the media in other countries ? 
  i was born in italy , and have lived in 5 countries other than the us . 
  in my personal experience , the country that is most resistant to confronting its past transgressions is the uk . 
  but , if you want a simple test , take a terrible incident in the history of a country , and see if that is mentioned or featured in any popular media . 
  or , look at their history textbooks . 
  so , has there ever been a belgian move or tv show about leopold ii ? 
  or , you can just do a litle googling https://www.quora.com/what-are-belgians-taught-in-school-about-king-leopold-ii-and-of-course-the-drc http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/21/arts/belgium-confronts-its-heart-darkness-unsavory-colonial-behavior-congo-will-be.html, 
  yes , we export a lot of entertainment . 
  but , the fact that so much of that is self examining is rather my point . 
  as to my lei , do a google search , and see what the top responses are , and where they are from . 
  you could do the same with columbus . 
  that is a touch more complex , as columbus day has sort of morphed into a celebration day for italian americans . 
  other than that , it 's a rather minor holiday , which most people do not celebrate , or get off work . 
  my point is that the us is self critical more than any other country i can think of, 
  no , that is just the british influence . 
  wasps profess to hate the french , but not the rest of the country .
