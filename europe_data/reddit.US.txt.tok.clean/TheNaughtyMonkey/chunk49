  and `` freedom fries '' ( which was only the capital cafeteria ) had much more to do with chirac breaking a promise than anything else . 
  most of the us tries to distance themselves from the whole english-french mutual loathing society . 
  you may want to look at : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_disputes_in_the_south_china_sea https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/africa%e2%80%93china_relations#military http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/29/the-motivations-behind-chinas-moves-into-latin-america.html, 
  china , us , russia, 
  europe , and north to central africa , yes . 
  ( with some limitations . 
  i recall that france and the uk had difficulty mounting air operations against libya without us direct support . 
  hillary 's war . ), 
  there is nothing wrong with being a regional power . 
  it is a conscious decision by european countries , who have prioritised other things above force projection . 
  serval was a french post-colonial action . 
  rca was a french post-colonial action unicorn was a french post-colonial action yes , every action you listed was either in europe , or european post-colonial africa . 
  as i said , regional power . 
  sorry , but it is true . 
  the eu does not exercise any power outside its region . 
  i suppose it depends on which americans you talk to . 
  most of us are very aware of how and why the french government aided the us , but even more the debt that the us owes specifically to the marquis de lafayette . 
  as to our terrible actions , i challenge you to name any other country that recognises , nay , wallows , in the worst parts of its history as much as the us . 
  for instance , everyone on the world knows about wounded knee , because they heard about it from us . 
  but , how many know about jalianwalla bagh ? 
  we are an odd bunch , i agree . 
  but , we never turn away from the worst parts of our history . 
  or , maybe it never happened . 
  as everyone who was there agrees . 
  but , this is a clear case of belief system versus facts . 
  and we all know how that turns out . 
  ( i am sure that trump said something to that effect , but no one would have actually printed out a bill . ), 
  well , as it never actually happened , i 'm just curious what other things that are not true you are `` pretty sure '' of . 
   actually there is plenty of evidence that the marshall plan 's significant is far less important than believed and in some cases actually hurt certain countries more than helped . 
  was responding to that . 
  ok , let 's try to explain some things that are going on in the world . 
  for wahtever reason , the eu does not really get involved in a lot of world issues . 
  it tends to concentrate in its region , which is why it is considered a regional power . 
  korea - why are the us and china so concerned about a new nuclear test ? 
  it 's not because anyone thinks that n. korea will start nuking s. korea . 
  it is because the north koreans have demonstrated that they will sell anything to anyone to get hard currency . 
  does anyone think that isis with a nuke is a good idea ? 
  also , n. korea is on the verge of being a failed state . 
  the chinese do not want to deal with millions of n. korean refugees , so are finally exerting pressure on the regime . 
  trump/russia - if you truly think that trump is acting to further russian interests , then you need to look at the one action ( or inaction ) that would benefit russia the most : namely , fracking . 
  it is rising us production of oil and gas that is keeping the price down . 
  putin desperately wants the price to rise , as it is a primary source of revenue for russia . 
  so , all trump would have to do is slow down fracking ( say , some new regulations , or oeven just leave some obama regualtions in place ) . 
  is trump doing that ? 
  any time you are looking at events like this , you should ask cui bono . 
  who benefits ? 
  europe is mostly sidelined on these issues , out of choice . 
  yes , russia is a regional issue for europe . 
  and , if europeans wish to reject the us in favor of tighter ties with russia , that is your choice . 
  edit : i find the downvotes interesting . 
  i can only assume they are from europeans who resist being called a regional power . 
  does n't change the fact that europe is a regional power . 
  bad comparison . 
  we are thankful to the french . 
  in fact , the us volunteers in ww1 in france directly cited that debt as a reason ( lafayette escadrille ) edit : downvotes ? 
  for the assertion that we are grateful to the french , or for referring to the lafayette escdrille ? 
  https://france-amerique.com/les-volontaires-americains-dans-la-premiere-guerre-mondiale/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medal_of_french_gratitude http://www.ourstory.info/2/c/legion.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lafayette_escadrille, 
  it is different between young and old . 
  but , it does help explain why people in the us do n't really care that much . 
  pretty sure ? 
  anything else you are `` pretty sure '' about ? 
  never expect gratitude for good deeds . 
  remember , these are the same people who bitch about the us being late to their genocidal wars . 
  i personally think a lot of the anger comes from shame . 
  so , you trust russia more because you believe trump is putin 's puppet ? 
  yeah , the japanese were incredibaly nasty . 
  us pows in german camps did n't have a great time , but at least they were n't being starved to death . 
  and yes , the rape of nanjing , and the human experimentation were both serious crimes agaisnt humanity . 
  the war in europe had a different context , as far as i can tell . 
  ( i have read a lot of newspapers from right before the us entry into the war . ), 
  while few americans had spent time in japan and china , many had ties to europe . 
  on the other hand , there was huge resistance to the idea that the us should get involved in yet another european war , especially after the war to end all wars did n't . 
  but , from the european perspective , i think it came down to movies . 
  hollywood would rather make a movie about the european war , for the scenery and ability to force a female lead in , than about the pacific war . 
  also , hitler was a more readily identifiable villain than the junta that ran japan . 
  my father served in the pacific during the war , and in europe immediately after . 
  people in europe tend to forget that the us was fighting its own war in the pacific , while helping out in europe . 
  how sad for you . 
  where did you go to school ? 
  my schools absolutely covered it . 
  am usian . 
  of course i know who he is . 
  do n't project your ignorance on the rest of us . 
  by all accounts , a pretty decent guy , too . 
  but , a name that will live in history . 
  happy yuri 's night , everyone !,

  i have been lurking here a while , and i see this from time to time . 
  what is it about the british that some other europeans note as being `` too american ? '', 
  ( as an american , i do n't think we see this at all . 
  most of us do n't really see that big a difference between the uk and the rest of europe . 
  but , that 's from outside , looking in . ),

  while freely admitting that us cars are generally crap ( which is why everyone 's parents drive toyotas ) , is there any us made car that you lust over ?
