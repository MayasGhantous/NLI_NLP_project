  it 's not like the us has n't ever had to deal with the results of poor european security before . 
  it is interesting that you believe that . 
  actually , about 5,000 us troops were exposed to chemical weapons from a number of caches . 
  http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/10/16/new-york-times-reports-wmd-found-in-iraq there was also the 500 tons of yellowcake ( uranium oxide ) that had to be removed from iraq , and shipped to canada . 
  i 'm not defending the war in iraq , but we should try to be accurate , especially as one of hussein 's old chemical weapons labs and storage facilities was taken over by isis , and there are reports of the syrians using mustard gas . 
  i suspect the issue is that there are cheaper alternatives in the us and canada that do not exist in europe . 
  oddly it was very difficult to find a comparison . 
  i suspect the eu banking sector is larger , but that is just based on inference . 
  if you go by total assets , i think its $ 15.5 trillion for the us , and probably about $ 30 trillion for the euro zone , and about 42 for the eu as a whole . 
  well , little more complicated than that . 
  its the same grounds on which they went after fifa : the money goes through the us , so the us has some legal oversight . 
  as i said , fascinating . 
  you should hope not , as you would fail . 
   sir mike said no-one in his department was now allowed to use the phrase . 
  the question is not what trump is saying . 
  the question is : why do so many people feel so abandoned that they listen ? 
  trump is a symptom , not a disease . 
  who is to decide that your opinion is worse than mine ? 
  i am , obviously . 
  of course , that is just my opinion , and you are free to judge it . 
  monkeys are not apes . 
  unless it is a credible , specific , and immediate threat , no , i do n't agree . 
  plenty of `` death threats '' from anonymous internet denizens that account to nothing . 
  the measure of your support for free speech is not how much you agree with the speaker , but how much you disagree . 
   `` because if you do n't stand up for the stuff you do n't like , when they come for the stuff you do like , you 've already lost . '' -- neil gaiman, 
  i think that is the opposite of what the poll said . 
  well , they ** do ** have a german queen . 
   but , i 'll modify . 
  it is a miracle !, 
  no one drinks it , but it mysteriously disappears !, 
  where ? 
  that was [ the germans and the british . 
  ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2013/05/blogs/graphic-detail/20131130_wom111_0.png ) that poll is fascinating . 
  sometimes its just the translation , but i have to say , i 've run across it . 
  you ca n't really control what people think , and should n't try . 
  you can , however , control what people do . 
  the guardian never really grasped economics . 
  imagine that you pass law that you have to pay the same wage around the world . 
  no one would go to the third world for cheaper labor , so no jobs would be there . 
  i honestly never understand the dislike some people have for musk . 
  last first . 
  there are no patents or trademarks associated with the plan . 
  musk had commissioned some research , but has not patented or protected any of that . 
  yes , it 's an old idea , but is possibly practical now because of technological changes . 
  he never claimed to have `` invented '' it . 
  you are asking specific engineering questions about something that has not been designed yet , much less built . 
  in the us , there are three seperate groups building test loops , to answer exactly those types of questions . 
  as to cost , [ an article ] ( http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-0114-uci-hyperxite-20160113-story.html ) i saw calculated that the much higher speeds , plus the fact that you can have multiple pods in a loop , lead to higher throughput . 
  they calculate that between la and sfo , they would move about 800 people per hour , over a distance of 600 km . 
  but , and i am very serious about this question , where does this hatred of musk come from ? 
  just because he is in the us , or that he is an individual ? 
  i really do not understand , and want to . 
  i had a great day at the range with friends last saturday . 
  200 rounds of .22 ( i really need the practice ) , about 24 of .45 ( colt 1911 ) , and a clip of ar-15 . 
  i do love shooting that 1911 . 
   it 's georgian . 
  well , the passenger throughput is probably greater than rail . 
  how many people commute by rail ? 
  evacuate by emergency repressurisation , but what sort of emergency do you anticipate ? 
  well , i think you meant patent , but it is n't an infringement . 
  musk has published the research they have done with no patent protection at all . 
  i saw a cba vs. hsr ( high speed rail ) and it was actually very good . 
  no rolling stock fees to speak of , much higher speeds , and probably safer ( people ca n't cross tracks . ), 
  the real question is whether materials science is advanced enough to make the tubes . 
  wait until all the lawsuits in other countries . 
  i suppose i am wondering how renewable energy can cost more , once installed . 
  is n't that kind of the point ? 
  not having to pay for fuel ? 
  well , if other producers can produce for a lower cost than solar , not sure how much responsibility the government should have in subsidising the more expensive means . 
  do n't they already subsidize the installation ? 
  if so , what are the marginal costs per kwh ? 
  are you saying you ** do ** have tsunamis ? 
  that really does not make any sense . 
  cost + profit + tax = price . 
  if the cost of production falls , that has no direct effect on profit . 
  especially in a monopoly . 
  i could see that . 
  i seem to rememebr that the counties around dc are among the 10 richest in the country . 
  ok , what is your actual point here ? 
  are you asserting some sort of german superiority based on the number of languages spoken ? 
  when did this become a `` dick-measuring contest ? '', 
  i have absolutely no idea what your point is , and honestly , have lost interest . 
  you seem very arrogant and rude , over some argument that you imagine we are having . 
  well , drivers ' licenses are done by state . 
  so , for instance , north carolina ( where i live ) only does the driver 's test in 10 languages , but california does so in 32 languages :  amharic , arabic , armenian , cambodian , chinese , english , farsi , french , german , greek , hebrew , hindi , hmong , hungarian , indonesian , italian , japanese , korean , laotian , polish , portuguese , punjabi , rumanian , russian , samoan , serbo-croatian , spanish , tagalog , thai , tongan , turkish , vietnamese . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://www.usenglish.org/view/305 ) how many languages are spoken in the us ? 
  who knows ? 
  almost all of them ? 
  big country . 
  lots of immigrants every year . 
  we will probably almost always have the most languages spoken , just because of immigration . 
  i 'm not saying it 's right or wrong . 
  i 'm just trying to explain what europe means to the us . 
  and it 's not like its ancient history . 
  the last time was about 20 years ago . 
  add on top of that all the families who immigrated from europe . 
  they all had some reason to leave , and some of that gets passed down . 
  lol but they would have their own senators . 
  more likely they put austin in the most conservative part of the state .
