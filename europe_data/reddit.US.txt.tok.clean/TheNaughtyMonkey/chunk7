  if you buy the cheapest option , do not be surprised if it is not as good as a more expensive option . 
  although , corn-fed and grass-fed beef taste very different . 
  i find that very surprising . 
  have you ever looked for a good burger ? 
  i like a place here in cary , nc called tribeca . 
  they have their own butcher , and source all their meat and produce locally . 
  i like my burger rare , so am used to ordering `` as rare as the chef will allow . '', 
  i said that at tribeca , and they replied that the chef would serve it to me raw , if i wanted . 
  i did n't want . 
  wondering how long before someone drags the us into it . 
  well , that did n't take long . 
   during the entire course of his presidency there has n't been a single scandal involving obama 's personal life . 
  a low bar , but sadly accurate . 
   europe has never been as peaceful back when more money was spent on the military . 
  you 're welcome . 
  did n't nato require us refueling to bomb libya ? 
  we actually have yet to nominate our presidential candidates . 
  i think you wrote your mp 's 5 year old kid . 
  i will bring [ ron swanson ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xepxmesq4k ) for you . 
  and maybe a nice bottle of woodford reserve for me . 
  but not as nasty . 
  coming from a country with so many different religions and religious people , we avoid religious arguments , as much as possible . 
  what people believe is their own business . 
  i like your name there , pardner . 
  hopefully , you will get the references on this story . 
  i was at tate brothers on davis islands one night after sailing . 
  someone came in and said the shuttle was going up . 
  we all emptied out with our beers over to channel dr. 
  saw it launch beautifully . 
  and then , without any discussion , about 2/3 of those watching turned around and mooned the space shuttle . 
  moving back end of this year . 
  i miss it . 
  no , it most assuredly does not . 
  not until the subscribers grow up a bit . 
  `` guardian style '' is an oxymoron . 
  and , given how laughable their editors are , they really should not be advising anyone on matters grammatical . 
  i 'd like to see a ctiation for that . 
  `` whom '' is used when it is the object of a verb . 
  at least , according to the bbc . 
   as of 2012 , about 800,000 canadians accounted for 2 percent of the nation 's 40.8 million immigrants . 
  they keep threatening/promising but never do . 
  if al sharpton really promises to leave if trump is elected , i would consider voting for trump . 
  2 russian bombers , a rafale , and 2 eurofighters walk into a bar . 
  `` is that another fighter ? '', 
  `` no , it 's just a mirage . '', 
  democracy can be a bitch . 
  i do not want to get into that discussion . 
  i am not voting for either . 
  well , i like sen. sanders , but his policies , as proposed , are not practical . 
  however , at this point , we need to look at alternatives . 
  i do not like mr. trump , but again , we need to change things . 
  i do agree with you about mrs. clinton , who i truly think would be bad for the country . 
  i started to laugh , but then realised you may not know . 
  we have a 2 party system , republicans and democrats . 
  the man leading the republican primary election was , until last year , a member of the democratic party . 
  the man almost leading the democratic primary election was , until last year , not a member of the democratic party . 
  the woman currently leading the democratic primary is under multiple fbi investigations for mishandling of classified information , public corruption , and maybe other things as well . 
  basically , the voters in both parties are rejecting their party establishments . 
  right and left agree that things must change , and we can not continue our current crony capitalism . 
  and the leaders of both parties are terrified what might happen to their cozy relationships . 
  so , it 's a mess . 
  you may have noticed that we in the us are not very happy with how our government has been acting , too . 
  we just express our displeasure more loudly . 
  you are absolutely correct on that , i had forgotten . 
  so , the us is getting the germans to spy on a part-german company ? 
  something about that does n't sound right . 
  yeah , i do n't really understand that , either . 
  so , we are getting the germans to spy on the french for us ? 
  when i say it like that it makes sense . 
  i tried the us map . 
  got 17187 . 
  i 'm rather pleased with that . 
  ( thank you for the link . ), 
   why ca n't germans just spy on the foreign companies and steal their trade secrets like normal countries ? 
  years ago i had a friend who would not shut his party down until they sent the helicopter . 
  he was very proud of that . 
  i have n't been illuminated directly , but i have had them go over a window to my apartment . 
  that was bad enough !, 
  pro tip : stay away from areas illuminated by police helicopters . 
   by your logic no , by us law , and your referenced convention on human rights . 
  i had nothing to do with either . 
  and no , your failure to pay a fine to a private company does not qualify either in the us or europe , as it was not a fine from a court . 
  lol sounds like miami, 
  you said it was unlawful under the european convention on human rights . 
  i pointed out that it actually is not . 
  i lived in miami by some railroad tracks . 
  damn thing would come through at midnite , bellowing that horn . 
  only place i ever had to sleep with earplugs . 
  how about a cadillac car horn ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbtob4we-zs#t=2m45s yes , in a honda . 
  from the [ european convention on human rights article 4 , section 1 ] ( http://www.echr.coe.int/documents/guide_art_4_eng.pdf )  3 . 
  for the purpose of this article the term `` forced or compulsory labour '' shall not include : ( a ) any work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention imposed according to the provisions of article 5 of this convention or during conditional release from such detention ; and the relevant article 5 section  1 . 
  everyone has the right to liberty and security of person . 
  no one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law :  b. the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law ; which is precisely what happened in the three cases you linked . 
  usa : traffic and the occasional loud muscle car exhaust . 
  1st link : `` a poor single mother seeks justice against biloxi after she was imprisoned ** for not paying $ 400 in court fees , ** '' 2nd link : `` files a lawsuit against the debtor requiring a court appearance . 
  ** a notice to appear in court is supposed to be given to the debtor . 
  if they fail to show up , a warrant is issued for their arrest . 
  ** '' 3rd link : `` in 2014 , national public radio ( npr ) posted a report stating that there were still cases of judges imprisoning people who ** have not paid court fees ** '' 4th link : same as the 2nd, 
  how about little boys boxing .
