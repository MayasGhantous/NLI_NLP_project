  no , actually on both . 
  the scandinavians island hopped through iceland and greenland across the north atlantic . 
  the theory about roman contact with the americas is based on a find in nova scotia , which would imply a similiar route had been taken . 
   it appears that things are a little cheaper for you , but compared to income its much more . 
  i 'm no expert , but the scandinavian ships were n't much more than that . 
  and [ the roman merchant ships resembled those . 
  after looking , it ** is ** below the us average of 12 cents per kwh . 
  my local electricity is nuclear , if that makes a difference . 
  i think you entirely missed the point . 
  i agree that op , while paying less for certain services in absolute terms , pays more in terms of income . 
  would you like to point out where i am wrong ? 
  chechan terrorists are from chechnya . 
  all of my friends who served in iraq who had contact with the kurds loved them . 
  well , there is some theorizing that the romans actually got to north america , so ship quality was n't really relevant . 
  ca n't tell if that is a joke or not . 
  dear italy , if this store is not closed within 1 year , i will be very disappointed in you . 
   sincerely , monkey, 
  just to compare expenses : electricity - 9.3 cents per kwh ( nc electricity is expensive edit : actually , its below the us average of 12.1 cents ) ) water - about $ 4.38 per 1,000 gallons ( or 3800 liters ) internet + tv - hugely variable . 
  i pay $ 70 for 250/25 mbit , but google gigabit is becoming available , which is about $ 60 for 1000 mbit . 
  phone - way more expensive . 
  i pay too much for what i use , should be paying about $ 30/month it appears that things are a little cheaper for you , but compared to income its much more . 
   slavonia the only area by that name i know of is a region of croatia , not a country . 
  yugoslavia was the country before that . 
  but , i accept that there may be slight differences in translation . 
  i agree . 
  i was taught that a continent is a tectonic plate , but the meaning seems to be variable . 
  i have seen the europe is a continent argument . 
  i have a hard time thinking of kazakhstan being in europe . 
   http://kazakhworld.com/kazakhstans-biggest-question-europe-or-asia/, 
   czechen republic that 's czech republic , not to be confused with chechnya . 
  there is no slavonia , its slovenia . 
  czech republic has a border with slovakia , but not with slovenia, 
  also , an aussie with a strong accent says australia in a similar sounding way to austria . 
  that 's true . 
  is europe a continent ? 
  i 'm shocked !, 
  shocked , i say !, 
   ( i myself download everything i watch . ), 
  mobile data is still really expensive here . 
  i 'm happy with my 250 mb cable modem , until google fibre gets here this summer . 
  thats pretty sweet . 
  what are the actual speeds you see ? 
  and are people using mobile for their primary internet connection ? 
  countries do not make exclusionary trade policies . 
  no , this would never happen . 
  but , yes , the us would probably choose the uk over the rest of europe . 
  and yes , that would mean no access to german exports , but as those are mostly cars , which can be replaced from other sources , it would n't matter . 
  but , again , this has never happened , and would never happen . 
  you are suggesting trade sanctions like those imposed against iran . 
  why would anyone want to do that ? 
  link number one is the us saying they would not engage in such action , and link number 2 is bluster ( there would be a trade agreement almost instantly ) . 
  its an european matter , to be decided by europeans . 
  the us has no , and should have no , influence on the outcome . 
  ( amusingly , the brits say we want them out of the eu , to make the eu weaker . 
  the rest of europe says we want them in the eu , to make the eu weaker . 
  well , 1 ) no , no one is stupid enough to do that . 
  2 ) i suspect that if the us had to make that choice , they would choose the uk . 
  most of what the us imports from europe is luxury goods . 
  so , the rich folk might have to go somewhere else for their conspicuous consumption , and the poor folk somewhere else for their flat-pack furniture . 
  the uk is about 25 % of the us trade with europe , and we have a slight trade surplus . 
  we have a trade deficit with the rest of europe  the five largest country suppliers of imports are : germany ( $ 114.6 billion ) , united kingdom ( $ 52.6 billion ) , france ( $ 45.3 billion ) , italy ( $ 38.7 billion ) , and ireland ( $ 31.6 billion ) . 
  most of the german trade is luxury cars ( bmw , mercedes , porsche , and some [ but falling ] vw ) . 
  cutting that off would probably help the domestic car industry . 
  why would the us stop trading with the uk ? 
  if 25 % of the economy is one sector , that sector dominates the economy . 
  so , unfamiliar with the history of the middle east , then ? 
  hey , hey . 
  we are normalising relations with iran , in case you missed that . 
  i do n't disagree with the rest of what you said . 
  most ? 
  hmm , korea or iran . 
  least ? 
  ( leaving aside war zones ) china ( yes , big country . 
  but , i mean beijing or other large city ), 
  oddly , i had jeb as my governor on florida . 
  he was a pretty good governor . 
  looking at his campaign , though , i do n't think his heart was ever in it . 
  i suspect the only reason he thought the country might vote for a bush was that so many were voting for a clinton . 
  i still have my fingers crossed that crazy uncle joe ( joe biden ) jumps in late . 
  they are both disasters in the making . 
  i will say i hate hillary , though . 
  i have only one vote , but no one to give it to . 
  sanders and trump are the anti-interventionists , but i ca n't vote for either . 
  so , does that mean that our former colonial masters have some sort of obligation to fix our problems ? 
  if so , we in the us have that one backwards . 
  not sure where you got that impression , but it is far from the truth .

  well , then , i suggest you elect some better politicians . 
  oh , and stop giving peace prizes to people before they start 4 wars . 
  ( yes , i do see the irony in that . ), 
  and south america is all ex-european colonies . 
  what 's your point ? 
  if the uk and france are not responsible for their own actions , then we should treat them as children . 
   insinuating that irish english is n't standard is extremely insulting . 
  i agree , but does n't stop the brits from telling everyone how wrong they are . 
  so , the us did ** not ** cause the syrian civil war ? 
   we should definitely bribe them back into the union that rather sums things up , does n't it ? 
  what happens when you run out of bribe money ? 
  obama does n't really like the british that much . 
  maybe that whole torturing his grandfather business influenced his view .
