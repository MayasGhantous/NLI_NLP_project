  western nations want actual asylum seekers ; they should n't be benefiting smugglers at the cost of everyone . 
  the non-refugees , of which there are many , do n't benefit as much as they think they will either . 
  they are told the uk ( or germany , sweden , etc ) is a paradise where everyone gets a free home . 
  smugglers bring them ( most are men ) to the country then charge an exorbitant fee for doing so . 
  the immigrants basically become slaves as they try and pay off this insane fee , with little hope of going home or seeing their loved ones . 
  this . 
  this * causes * extremism and eventually conflict . 
  also germany trying to silence dissenting opinions ? 
  and they 're calling the other people fascist ? 
  which is the majority . 
  i will never understand why swedes think importing masses of ultra-conservative religious folk will make their society more progressive . 
  something like 1/3 to 1/2 of all these `` refugees '' are not even syrian . 
  so i ca n't say i 'm surprised . 
  turns out an adult replied to my question , so alle ist in ordnung , no thanks to you . 
  check my response to him, 
  hey , do n't be salty to me , i 'm not the one stifling your press, 
  i think there 's a false equivalency here . 
  journalist can not pester the families of the victims while , at the same time , the media can report the events of what happened . 
  reporting the broad facts is n't going to disturb an investigation . 
  the police can choose what information to release or not to . 
  a `` blackout '' implies the media not even talking about the broad facts ... is that correct ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  kind of like the media `` forgot '' to report the k\u00f6ln rapes ? 
  exactly , so recognizing that islamic immigrants could pose a threat to the security of your country is in no way racist, 
  why ? 
  what is wrong with people, 
  they only want to live there because it 's near nyc without the insane prices and taxes of ny . 
  nj is a dump, 
  you 're flat out wrong . 
  your climate is fucking amazing .

  a small part of georgia ( and azerbaijan ) are in geographical europe , but most of it , including batumi , is not . 
  i 'd understand if the mods allowed the european parts of georgia or turkey to be posted , but posting pictures of cities not in europe just does n't make much sense to me . 
  seriously , i do n't go to this sub to see more shit about trump . 
  then i 'm just wondering ... what does this post have to do with europe ? 
  trust me , it was the same since 2002 . 
  before that , i was a child a ca n't remember . 
  ... that 's not true . 
  at all . 
  what ? 
  the us has much stronger egg regulations . . what should be repealed ? 
  in the us not only do you have to keep eggs refrigerated for storage , shipping , and sale , but the eggs themselves have to be cleaned . 
  you do n't keep them at room temp lol . 
  every american has a fridge , which is where you keep them . 
  i only buy pasture-raised eggs and they last probably 4-6 weeks . 
   but you may see some dirt/bird dropping residue/whatever here and there . 
  eh , yeah , no thanks . 
  wow , that 's fucking neat . 
  til . 
  ... the graph did n't mention muslims at all . 
  furthermore , the us is only marginally lower than turkey because there 's so many us military members in germany . 
  ... facts are facts man . 
  hiding facts because someone might think something you do n't want them to is very kim jong-un-esque . 
  that sucks , but it 's also partially due to the way the military is viewed here . 
  after the iraq war joining the military seemed a less honorable thing to do for many americans , so the people who actually * wanted * to join it were often rednecks . 
  then you had people who joined it for secondary reasons which are mostly all poor minorities . 
  now that everyone is expected to go to college ... yeah, 
  i 'm guessing this is nearly all military guys ... hence why the number seems higher than you 'd expect . 
  i 'm sure for americans not in the military actually living there , the number is very low . 
  ... turkey is one of the last `` european '' countries i 'd want to live in , but sure . 
  it 's like the rest of western asia - not culturally european . 
  russia and iceland are missing though . 
  very southeast, 
   the word right after the bold says `` language . '', 
  notice the `` or '' in the sentence . 
  it can be based solely on ancestry . 
  maybe you do n't use the word `` ethnicity '' that way in germany , but that 's how it is used here . 
   if you speak english , live in america , with an american style of living , and have no ties to germany other than `` family lore says great-grandpa came from there '' you are not ethnically german any more than i am ethnically chinese . 
  uh , no lol . 
  if you moved to china with your german wife and had a kid , they 'd be ethnically german , not ethnically chinese , even if you did n't teach them german . 
  `` nobody is ever british '' because their ancestors migrated so long ago , mainly in the south , so they no longer consider themselves ethnically british . 
  they consider themselves ethnically `` american '' , whereas many descendants of europeans in the north , especially irish and italian , absolutely do n't . 
  notice how that took a good 100 + years , which is longer than many other migrants , including many german migrants . 
  when saying `` i am ( a descendent of a ) german '' became popular , these different ethnic groups did n't really mix , so it made a lot more sense . 
  now of course they intermarry freely , so saying , `` i 'm half ____ and a quarter ______ '' seems like it does n't matter , but the tradition held on . 
  so yeah , i think i know a little bit more about my country than you , no offense . 
  ... that 's not what ethnicity means . 
   an ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as ** common ancestral ** , language , social , cultural or national experiences . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ emphasis added ] - wiki basically i mean they 're ( recent ) ancestors are german , not that they speak german or even relate to or know anything about germany . 
   irl : nazi safe harbour / online : white and european weird , that 's certainly not the stereotype here . 
  we view them as them as basically another brazil or chile . 
  i know they used to be quite well off though . 
  damn , it takes me driving 18 + hours to leave the country , or paying 500 + bucks for a plane ticket . 
  drove to quebec nonetheless , hell of a drive . 
  still , if you 're in the midwest , especially rural , there 's tons of people who are ethnically 50 and 100 % german . 
  14.4 % is a higher % than those of african ancestry in the us . 
  native american is what a lot of americans say they are but turn out to be 1/64 or something . 
  for instance , elizabeth warren . 
  but usually german is n't touted as an ethnicity here because most german immigrants were protestant and meshed well with the existing population , as opposed to irish and italians . 
  ( i have heard europeans get confused when someone tells them they 're irish or german . 
  they 're not saying they 're a citizen of those countries , just that they 're that ethnicity by blood . 
  it 's a shorthand way of saying it that has existed for centuries . 
  i 've always thought this was easily obvious but i 've honestly heard europeans getting confused at this . ), 
  how is banning women wearing underwear in public transport ads progressive ? 
  yeah , no . 
  i hate islam and think it 's evil , but i 'd never kill a child . 
  do n't you hate wahhabism ? 
  do n't you think it 's `` evil '' ? 
  i 'm guessing you would n't kill a wahhabist child in their mother 's lap . 
   by publicizing sex attacks at one festival when a bunch of people get together to mass rape , that 's news .
