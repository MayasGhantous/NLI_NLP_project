he did n't forget it , he never experienced it in the first place , so that the soviets might as well have never existed at all . 
  europe needs a political union for its own survival . 
  it has proven to be unable to resist murdering its neighbors for the past like 1500 years . 
  with the exception of the brief american administered interregnum of the late 20th/early 21st century . 
  but even beyond that , federalizing does n't take your democracy away . 
  you just have to actually build the union correctly , something everybody seems to be unwilling to even try , for which you have no one to blame but yourselves . 
  can you please stop this shit ? 
  its getting tiring . 
  nobody forced you to join the eu . 
   should the uk really help an organization that forces german policies on others , policies that the uk would not want for itself ? 
  germany would n't be forcing its policies on other countries if the other countries like britain were n't such little bitches with regard to taking their ball and going home . 
  in the world of adults , when partners in a joint venture like the eu does something you do n't like , you talk to that person and see if you can compromise , instead of threatening to leave if you do n't get everything you want . 
  idk about that . 
  mig-21 's are an ancient airframe . 
  maintaining something that old has to cost a small fortune . 
  yeah , lots of science and technology ... given to people that your population most wants to be rid of . 
  it just so happens that the smart people who come up with the tech for mass murder are all exempt from having to actually use them . 
  its great having lots of high tech shit , but you still need to dupe the least educated people in your population to put themselves in danger to actually use it . 
  or did you think we live in a fantasy world where infantry no longer exists ? 
  who said anything about nuclear war ? 
  nuclear strategy for the u.s. has been quite clear for the past 40 years at least . 
  the u.s. will not use nuclear missiles unless another nation uses nuclear missiles on the u.s. first . 
  nobody has any interest in invading russia , so russia 's sole reason to use nuclear weapons is gone . 
  putin knows using nuclear missiles as an aggressive strategy to destroy enemy conventional forces that are n't invading russian soil is a death sentence for him and the rest of the world . 
  putin will not use nuclear missiles . 
   a well educated population , living in a healthy democracy and in a strong economy automatically results in a strong army . 
  where the fuck do you people learn this trite bullshit ? 
  the better education a population has the more likely it is they wo n't join the military , assuming no compulsory service . 
  in a volunteer force , virtually the only people who join are people who have no prospects in any other field . 
  yes , every presidential candidate spouts this shit and every election the morons believe it . 
  if people have a problem , they should put on their big boy trousers and try to fucking fix it . 
  this goes for the eu as well . 
  this would require electing responsible people to represent you and not career politicians , and so it will never happen . 
  i do n't think our government has any desire to impose its will on european nations . 
  our greatest concern regarding europe is that russia stay in its cage until it decides to be civilized . 
  a united europe is also one that is not constantly at war with itself , as evidenced by the past millennia of more or less constant warfare . 
  this might be my america exceptionalism talking but without the u.s. to be there at the end of ww2 , europe would have been slitting each other 's throats again within 20 years , or be totally under the thumb of the soviets , whichever . 
  we had our own brief taste of what europe was like with our articles of confederation . 
  you are correct . 
  obama was seriously getting ready to let russia fully out of its cage until putin managed to piss the whole opportunity down the drain . 
  i wonder if he stays up at night dreaming of how much richer he 'd be if he actually had accepted u.s. friendship . 
   the countries pushing for it tend to be those who were destroyed by wwii . 
  surprise surprise , the countries that have been under the thumb of western and eastern powers are now seeking a different system from the status quo that europe has been under since the roman empire fell . 
  a status quo that britain has played a key role in extending for the past 300 or so years . 
  seems like you just need to write a constitution that is n't shit that lays out all the things a centralized government can do and delegates all other powers to states . 
  and lay out a clear method for which said constitution can be amended . 
  in the end , every single original colony ratified to u.s. constitution despite some states having very british-like obstinance . 
  but this would require the politicians actually coming together , putting their egos aside , and compromising . 
  so it 'll never happen . 
  it only took the original politicians a few years to realize the articles of confederation was a terrible idea that was going to turn the u.s. into facsimile of europe . 
  also geopolitics . 
  a eu that is united is an eu that shares american principles ( well , the ** core ** american principles anyway ) . 
  what this means for the eu is basically nothing more than keeping russia in check for as long as it needs to . 
  and to be honest , we 'd like you to do so without having to be told . 
  you see , nato policy towards russia is sort of like the strategy a person would when trying to capture a wild animal without using drugs . 
  as long as russia is a threat towards its neighbors , it needs to be caged so it can only harm itself and not others . 
  the problem is that obama did n't anticipate relations with putin to sour , because he and the rest of the the u.s. military are ready to turn their full attention to china and the rest of asia . 
  that leaves the eu to take on the burden of making sure putin eventually decides to stop acting like a rabid dog . 
  a united eu is key to this strategy . 
  i 'd say trade deals and economics are secondary . 
  we do n't really give a shit what you do with your economies , as long as the eu 's regional goals align with the u.s. government 's global goals , you guys can do whatever you want . 
  we know you guys do n't want to project military power or whatever , but at the very least you have to keep the rabid dogs in your own back yard in check . 
  you really have no clue as to the current climate in the u.s. trump 's base is not the republican party at all . 
  the party loyalists all shit themselves over the possibility of trump getting nominated and united behind cruz . 
  trump 's base is a lot of very pissed off lower class and middle class people . 
  trump very much ** can ** win . 
  because the democrats in this country do n't realize the threat he is and are just doing what they 've done for half a century : acting smug as fuck , and doing nothing but ridiculing anyone else who 's opinion differs from theirs , which is what drives people to trump in the first place . 
  in the very real possibility that trump wins , the democrats again do the same thing they did when gw won : they 'll sit back scratch their heads and say : `` what the fuck just happened ? '', 
  i do n't want to see trump win as much as anyone else , but there is a very real possibility of it happening . 
  i think there is some kind of unspoken competition among american ipa brewers to see who can give their ipa the dumbest fuckin ' name imaginable . 
  no thanks , we have too many as it is . 
  yeah you were just shipping people off to gulag to kill them in secret , much more civilized . 
  thats sort of why i 'm on the fence about this leak . 
  putin can go fuck himself , but soros can equally go fuck himself . 
  it is a certainty soros engages in equally ethically dubious if not flat out illegal tax dodging . 
  but , the only additional certainty right now is that he does n't use this specific method . 
  virtually every caribbean island is its own tax shelter , not to mention the u.s. itself , so there would be much more work involved in ferreting out soros ' bullshit . 
  do n't forget cia would be also outing the dirty laundry of david cameron 's family . 
  pm of the us 's closest ally . 
  why the fuck would the u.s. ever do that ? 
  actually , i hope nobody bothers answering that question , i 'm not really in the mood to hear batshit insane conspiracy theories today . 
  does this mean i am literally some random russian 's boogeyman , hiding under their bed at night ? 
  it is n't nearly as ... fulfilling as i 'd imagined it to be . 
  also the commute is a bitch . 
  it really just comes down to the `` system '' adding up the wants/needs . 
  here the `` system '' is just short for the metaphorical machinery that keeps the economy running ( ie the supply/demand curve ) . 
  the public has decided it wants iphones at an affordable price . 
  apple has decided that it wants to have a certain amount of profit per phone sold ( lets say $ 300 for a number pulled out of my ass ) . 
  the system adds those wants up concluded that the only way to get both those things is to have people who are practically slaves make them in china or taiwan . 
  its the exact same system at work with virtually everything , its just that people 's priorities change the outcome . 
  you may feel guilty that your iphone was constructed by a slave , but if it means you have to start paying $ 10000 for the same device constructed domestically by unionized workers with benefits , most people will happily forget about the slave they 've never laid eyes on and will never know . 
  whichever documentary you watched it was undoubtedly based on a time when russia 's conventional forces were still considered a threat to the west . 
  russian tanks invading germany or france is so far from the realm of reality these days its not even something worth considering . 
  russia 's conventional forces are n't a threat to the west , even given the shitty state most european militaries are in . 
  russia 's conventional forces are at their biggest threat when they are doing exactly what they are doing right now : salami tactics . 
  the u.s. nuke policy ( as far as i can remember ) is to never ever use nukes unless nukes are used on us first . 
  it does n't matter whether a nuke is used on troops or cities . 
  as long as putin is n't stupid enough to use nukes first , we will never use them in turn . 
  this is why we also have the strongest military in the world , so that we can turn back any and all conventional aggression . 
  so if riga and prague are swimming in russian tanks , and russia did not use nukes to make that happen , then no nukes will be flying to moscow in turn .
