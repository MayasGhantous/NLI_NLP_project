  happy st. patrick 's to you , buddy !, 
  does [ west side story ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055614/ ) count ? 
  it * is * directly referenced from shakespeare 's play , but it 's been reimagined into the story of a born-in-nyc white guy of probably polish descent falling in love with a latina girl who recently came from puerto rico . 
  only problem is , their friends have been waging a horrid gang war there puerto rican teens are pitted against `` native-born '' white kids . 
  it 's been very highly regarded as a tragic commentary on us race relations , even more impressively considering the broadway musical debuted in 1957 . 
  the film adaptation won best picture for 1961 at the oscars . 
  leonard bernstein 's score with stephen sondheim 's lyrics are fucking timeless . 
  are you danish by any chance ? 
  german can be either hilarious/campy , hardcore , or beautiful in its own way . 
  swedish can actually sound a little sexy/sensual at times . 
  danish sounds a bit dorky . 
  norwegian by far sounds the most stereotypically `` scandinavian '' & seems all slurred together to me . 
  icelandic sounds pretty brisk & awesome . 
  i especially love the tongue-rolling . 
  celtic flavor to it , almost . 
  dutch sounds like a guttoral , `` sloshy '' blend of english , french , & german for some reason . 
  flemish is like dutch but a lot less harsh-sounding . 
  that would actually be a pretty amusing , if not * good * , movie . 
  yeah , i noticed that refugees/other foreigners were a small minority of the new rape/sexual harassment cases . 
  this could really speak volumes about austria 's culture , could n't it ? 
  are you male by any chance ? 
  that 's so sad , though . 
  why do you think sexism permeates austria so badly , even though it shares cultural traits with germany who does n't go through this shit so much ? 
  which arguably makes it even * worse * . 
  honestly , there are a lot of issues that all need to be addressed in our country . 
  i 'll read up on what the different candidates would do in regards to the immigration crisis , & if the one who 'd take actions i agree with in regards to immigration would also do what i most agree with elsewhere , then i 'd vote for them . 
  however , what i am in particular more concerned about is stopping illegal immigration at this stage in time . 
  also , i 'm also worried about healthcare , economic regulation , trimming corporate rights , etc. 
  on top of that . 
  our flag is a symbol . 
  it stands for freedom , familiarity , & people who are willing to do a lot to make things better . 
  no , i am afraid of the culture attached with burqas ( like the suppression of womens ' & other minorities ' rights ) , not really the burqas themselves . 
  if bernie sanders gets elected , we might be much closer to universal health care in 7-9 years , depending if the republicans that dominate congress right now get voted out or not . 
  whoops . 
  i assumed too much there . 
  i 'll edit my comment to reflect that . 
  but still , my last 2 sentences . 
  okay . 
  good luck buddy . 
  thank you . 
  this is * exactly * the fucking issue europe has by not `` toning down '' these peoples before letting them in . 
  all the hard work & social progress that has made postmodern europe so safe & well-reputed risks being dismantled in the interest of satisfying immigrants . 
  can confirm , it takes like 10-15 minutes to heat the water using my kettle on the stove , versus about 2 minutes & 30 seconds to heat by sticking the cup in the microwave . 
  you eu types * are * desperate , are n't you ? 
  `` vibrant '' indeed . 
  what about during wwii ? 
  `` keep calm & carry on '' ? 
  thank you for explaining it beautifully . 
  i imagine this is what happened in much of europe , especially the uk , during the world wars . 
  i feel for your friend . 
  i hope things improve for him soon . 
  we 're starting to get our first tastes of syrian refugee over here in the us . 
  right now the us has only approved about 10,000 refugees & the vast majority of them are women , young children , lgbtq + , & elderly . 
  however , we have let in a few adult men who are married fathers coming with their families that include children . 
  i live in a politically central county of california , one of the much more liberal states , so refugees have been taken in by a few cities in my area . 
  there 's very few issues with them at the moment , as they number like 30-100 in my county , but at the mall just a week & a half ago i saw a husband & wife duo in their 30s-40s who were likely from somewhere in the middle east ( we have been getting more middle eastern folk in general coming here , not just refugees ) out shopping . 
  husband was dressed like a `` normal '' californian , board shorts , polo shirt , flip flops . 
  wife , however , was wearing a pitch black burkha that only showed her eyes . 
  it raised a little concern out of me . 
  will we be seeing more women in cloth bags as more people from places that believe in them come to our country ? 
  i 'm a bit worried for the future . 
  no decent jobs or salaries , that is why people leave places like croatia . 
  this is why europe & other places receiving significant immigration need to * stick to their guns * when dealing with the onslaught of a different culture . 
  they need to remember * why * exactly people are coming besides for the possible economic perks , & make sure the new arrivals get it fucking * nailed * into their skulls that the west stands for tolerance & equal opportunity for * all . 
  oh my god , that is * exactly * the way to describe that situation . 
  no good risking your life & bread to leave your home country in favor of one that will actually protect you , only for all your asshole neighbors to follow you & recreate the shithole you left behind . 
  fucking tumblrism making its way out of the internet . 
  so much this . 
  here , have an upvote !, 
  yeah , it * fucking sucks * to immigrate/move long-term to the us legally . 
  one of my friends is actually from malaysia ( she is here on a student visa ) , but her family are indian sikhs . 
  when her grandfather i think came to get a visa to visit family living in the us ( all on a mixture of citizenship & green cards ) recently he got the full interrogation & background check just because he was wearing the sikh turban , which according to immigration officials in the us must * obviously * mean that you 're muslim & out to bomb people . 
  -_- tonight i also learned from another friend that if you are working age & wish to move to the us , you can only get your visa renewed . 
  this has to be done once a year , & the authorities can revoke it for even minor offenses . 
  our government does n't want people coming in legally to work & steal our jobs , but illegals who swim the rio grande can do exactly that just fine . 
  that we are * heavily * , heavily patriotic & love our flag to bits . 
  it 's a cringey stereotype for sure , but it also makes me feel all warm & proud inside that we love our flag & take pride in ourselves this much . 
  oooooh , windy !, 
  you win . 
  shit 's getting real . 
  come to southern california during [ santa ana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santa_ana_winds ) `` season '' , buddy . 
  i 'll agree , fall in the us is a fabulous time . 
  oh god , i fucking hate the humidity . 
  fucked up el nino weather means that it 's been * way * more humid than average in my neck of southern california since about early june 2015 , with as of yet few extra drops of rain to show for it . 
  we 're not the fucking east coast . 
  why is it muggy with rain showers in july ? 
  irish summers sound * very * nice . 
  kind of reminds me of summer on the coast of california , at least down here in ventura county . 
  tends to be actually pretty rainless & sunny though , but with breezes & temps ranging from cool to a little warm . 
  there 's humidity in the air a lot though , but then again to someone that lives about a 10-20 minute 's drive inland in sounthern california ( roughly central ventura county ) where the default weather 's dry as fuck , it * always * feels humid to me when there 's water in the air . 
  good job , bosnia !, 
  oh man , when i was in 3rd grade we had a presidents ' day assignment where we had to write about what we would do if we were president . 
  i spent the bulk of my short essay describing how i would try to get the czech republic & slovakia to reunite into czechoslovakia , because `` they could share materials '' & other fucking ridiculous `` reasons '' . 
  i even pointed out that they could `` get an artist to redesign the flag so it 's a blend of both their flags '' !, 
  * cringes because oh god that was horrible *, 
  oh , i do n't drink but i * do * love my meat , especially pork . 
  would prague still be a fun place for me ? 
  you usually choose to go visit the dentist , gynecologist , internist , etc. 
  your child does not choose to go to school & get the mandatory school medical exams . 
  how long has flanders been conducting these exams ?
