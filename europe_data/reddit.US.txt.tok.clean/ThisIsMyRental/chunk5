  `` selfishness '' is a huge part of the equation , but you also have to remember that europeans/canadians put up with their high taxes for universal health care , etc. 
  because they see themselves as able to fall into poverty moreso than americans do theirs , making their desire for socialistic programs a matter of self-interest as well . 
  americans , on the other hand , see themselves as more likely to make lots of money through hard work & / or run their own business , climb the income ladder basically . 
  if there 's higher taxes to pay for a universal health care system , then that 's money that ca n't be used to acquire new equipment , build up more savings , or hire a badly needed 3rd worker in the store on 10th street . 
  agreed . 
  the entire world is a better place to live if you already have an at least decent job . 
  once you have that for your new place , which location works best for you is a matter of what you value in daily life . 
  one of my old therapists has friends from france , parents with at least a daughter in her mid-late 20s . 
  they are well-off enough to pay for their daughter to attend a high-grade private school for high school & university . 
  she graduated high in her class & still works at mcdonald 's because she ca n't find a better job . 
  even 5 years after graduating university . 
  oh , did you take some tips from your cousin serbia ? 
  but ... what if you guys end up making a shitty married pair & divorce later ? 
  would you still be able to keep that dutch citizenship ? 
  that sucks dick . 
  i hope you stay safe , buddy . 
  oh , if only there were suicide booths ... . . just in case . 
  more like shit economy and high cost of living relative to earnings these days ... 
  how about fuck no ? 
  seriously , we have formally documented the risks of carrying a fetus even at the age of 40-45 . 
  why should we let a * 60 * year old carry a fetus ? 
  seriously , i highly doubt at this point that britain will end up leaving the eu . 
  far too much shit that indicates that you have absolutely * no * survival plan for after the cord is cut has happened . 
  that * does * sound fucking weird , lol . 
  thanks for the guide !, 
  holy shit , i need to try some hobnobs now do n't i ? 
  lem me try to find them in my smallish southern california town . 
  marriages * are * difficult to maintain when you 're basically in 2 different countries/unions ... . . 
  that 's a fucking hilarious edit . 
  spain is fucking retarded & is only on germany time because franco was a hitler fanboy . 
  their sunrise/sunset times are pretty fucked up due to their time zone not matching their geographic position , does portugal really want that ? 
  ooooooohhhhhhh , them too . 
  but is n't it a * really * tiny island , though ? 
  what , you are n't fond of the soft southern drawl ? 
  in addition to * possibly * less attractive women . 
  god , britain , stop being such a shitty knockoff of south carolina !, 
  oh , that ; s horrible . 
  going to make plans to get citizenship from another country ? 
  honestly , i do n't see the danes being so idiotic as to leave based off migrant problems & a misjudged proportion of sovereignty like the brits just did . 
  they will complain & sometimes make moves that their neighbors construe as racist , but rock the boat with a referendum so hard they could fall out ? 
  no way !, 
  the danes have a fairly great lot in life right now & would * not * be willing to sacrifice that to make their fortune in the unknown . 
  not to mention less barbecue & damn good southern country cooking . 
  japan and its yen is analogous to a guy whose dick often grows far too large to be practical or fun . 
  looks like ireland might end up rolling in it if they get a bunch of those companies that need a new english-speaking country for their eu/european headquarters ... . 
  definitely visa shit , for sure . 
  no , absolutely * nobody * expected this to be easy , for either side . 
  however there was a thought/hope that maaaaaayyybee the british would come to their senses & end up deciding to remain by a * ver * slim margin . 
  are you happy with the result ? 
  i highly sense the mod team is pretty broken up about this , but they 're trying to put on a brave face for everyone else . 
  * what * a fitting song just about now . 
  wait , uk 's leaving ? 
  * shit , i ca n't believe that 's fucking happened . 
  just did . 
  no , it 's mostly been american stuff . 
  i 've been listening to disco/other dance-y music to complement how i feel . 
  no , not yet . 
  but thank you for offering , kind stranger . 
  ... i do n't even fucking know anymore . 
  that 's nice . 
  it 's always a bummer when you do n't feel as well to partake in holiday festivities . 
  edit : have fun !, 
  holy shit . 
  * holy shit . 
  * ** holy shit . 
  ** *** holy shit . 
  *** *** holy shit . 
  you 'll be alright doing midsummer festivities , right ? 
  well , that 's nice !, 
  spend the day recovering from your night of boozed-up worrying . 
  sweet . 
  californian here . 
  earlier in the evening . 
  watching election results instead of showering or doing homework . 
  holy shit , it will . 
  world just gets crazier & crazier each year , it seems . 
  1930s germany would like to have a word with you . 
  i now ca n't take my fucking eyes off the damn eu referendum election results . 
  election results for a country that does n't even border mine . 
  just wondering , since all of you guys are staying up all night to wait for the results , does that mean that you 'll be going to work later on exhausted & drunk , or did you ask for ( & receive ) a day off ? 
  cnn , maybe ? 
  okay . 
  we have the postal voting too . 
  just wondering , does the uk have a law requiring that if work scheduling * would * get in the way of voting , that the employer ** must ** provide 1-3 ( usually 2 ) hours off at the beginning or end of a shift so the employee can go vote ? 
  because that 's the situation in all 50 of the united states . 
  but then again , a lot of our polls tend to be open a shorter time than yours on election day . 
  as of 2014 generally the eastern states have polls open 6 to 7 am-7 to 8:30 pm , while out west polls are open longer , 6 to 7 am-9 to 11 pm . 
  some states are outliers on this schedule of closing .

  does n't work when the guy seeing your joke as terrible is * also * british . 
  jesus christ , i feel for you . 
  holy shit , you guys ' `` news `` papers are shit . 
  wow . 
  good job , ukrainian police !, 
  :d what a day it 's been , a gay pride event goes off without a hitch in a very homophobic country while in the us , a much more tolerant place , some asshole isis-loving douchetard has succeeded in murdering 50 people in a gay nightclub .
