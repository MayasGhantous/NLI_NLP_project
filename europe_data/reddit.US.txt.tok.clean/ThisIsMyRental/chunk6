  adding on to what / u/jollygruenegiant said , the main goal of the marshall plan was to first & foremost help europe lift themselves out of economic desperation , so that there would n't be a second great depression that plunged the continent back into war-hungry dictatorships-or communism . 
  in addition , the us basically gave europe stuff to help make its own needs with the condition that all the countries work together to use it , therefore helping with integration to avoid future war as well . 
  also , the us was n't just spending money without getting anything material in return . 
  included with the physical supplies & cash were a ton of credits usable for american products , which helped the us ( & to a lesser extent canada ) to develop a european market for its products . 
  the combination of this & the fact that europe was still rebuilding until the early-mid 50s helped the us secure a strong customer base in the years after ww2 , which in turn made it an even * bigger * economic powerhouse than it had been prewar . 
  one of the reasons the us has done so comparatively well with our intake of immigrants , both legal & illegal , is our assimilation . 
  people from other countries come & within 2-3 ( if not 1-2 ) generations they are culturally super-american . 
  if there 's a lot of people from a particular country/region that immigrate here the general american culture will likely absorb a compatible facet or two from that culture , plus a fondness for ( an americanized version of ) its cuisine . 
  the `` great american melting pot '' is n't one of our nicknames for nothing !, 
  sure would be cool if you guys were able to evolve into a `` european melting pot '' or sorts in regards to immigrants again . 
  i think it could help the situation a lot . 
  that 's a nicely introspective look into the belgian economy & how it relates to the people . 
  i saved your comment . 
  i 'm in california ( western us ) , chances are i was sleeping when the rest of you guys were commenting on this !, 
  hitler wanted a very small percentage of the eastern/western slavs to be slaves for the new german farmers that would live on their land . 
  not so much anymore ... , 
  well , shit ... i guess you guys are economically fucked then . 
  i 'm not . 
  that was just me being an offensive ` murican who could n't resist . 
  well ... how educated are you guys ? 
  especially in regards to the stem fields ? 
  * to the moonshine , everybody !, 
  they actually sound quite nice , to tell the truth . 
  especially croatia with its coastal areas like dalmatia . 
  did n't you guys at least use to have a booming silk industry ? 
  that 's ... . . actually a stupid enough idea to be absolutely brilliant . 
  loads of americans get thanksgiving week or at least part of it off . 
  plus the weather would n't be so fucking hot . 
  geez , i know you europeans like you summer vacations/holidays like we do , but how do you deal with the southern european heat without that much ac ? 
  * raises hands in the air with glee * 75 % here !, 
  i barely passed !, 
  that ' because we have n't done anything that fully qualifies as dicking them over . 
  your women were attractive , dude . 
  nice full bushes , mmmmmm . 
  yeah , reminds me of the joke/saying , `` what 's the difference between a cult [ not saying that greek pagan worship 's a cult ] and a religion ? 
  a religion is officially accepted by the masses . '', 
  i 'm pretty close to an atheist either way , regardless of the religion i 'm surrounded by . 
  although , having a country mostly worship the greek gods in this day & age would be * very * interesting to see . 
  it would be especially intriguing to witness the morality that their government & culture operate under , as a lot of the ethics in greek mythology are different from that of the judeo-christian tradition . 
  although our governments have drastically liberalized from what the bible prescribes as good morality , so most likely a government of a country worshiping the greek gods would undergo similar pragmatic changes over the decades/centuries . 
  also , now i feel bad that you live in a country where the official religion mocks scientists & lgbt + people . 
  i like how they 're pretty non-annoying about their decision to worship the ancient greek gods because it personally fit for them better than christianity . 
  although super strange to see people genuinely worship something that 's just been seen as cultural icons for centuries , i will admit that . 
  thank you for posting some lyrics to the song we were probably all thinking of . 
   homophiles you mean `` homophobes '' , do n't you ? 
  `` homophiles '' love lgbt + people , `` homophobes '' hate their guts . 
  please do . 
  you still have the aspects of your culture that christian practices implanted there . 
  a lot of traditions stay even though they really are n't practical or needed anymore . 
  sweet . 
  holy shit , you are so right . 
  ouch . 
  la 's sprawl is really that apocalyptic ? 
  i 'm actually in the greater la metro area . 
  someone who was in a class with me once had actually spent a semester in spain ( mostly around barcelona ) , & he described spain as almost exactly like la , but instead of half the people speaking spanish it has everyone speaking spanish . 
  okay . 
  i was just wondering if you had realized that about our world now . 
  the thing is , men did the labor because hard physical tasks were the main way to earn a living . 
  now we have began an era where the main way that people earn a living is through much more sedentary tasks such as working on the computer . 
  women can do that just fine . 
  a fairly significant chunk in the us . 
  nowhere close to the majority , but enough to be an issue . 
  well , that 's nice . 
  but sweden 's only one country , & one wealthy country at that . 
  jesus christ , that 's horrible . 
  the problem is that things just are n't as affordable as they were 50-60 years ago when housewife/career husband households were the norm . 
  better working conditions , more `` middlemen '' , & higher taxing have all contributed to that . 
  people can try to raise children on poverty wages , but oftentimes this involves going on welfare ( great way to destroy the government 's budget further !, 
  ) , skipping meals , relying on preocessed crap , having the lights & water turned off , or living in crappy housing/areas . 
  none of these is conducive to raising a healthy , happy , productive , law-abiding child . 
  and then these children will grow up & decide to not have ( as many ) children in order to avoid subjecting them to the childhood that they had , rendering your original `` plan '' futile in the long run . 
  it sucks , but that 's been our reality for at least 20 years now . 
  eh , give it a few decades . 
  eventually more men will be willing to stay home with their children & show that men can be just as good as women in that regard . 
  like it or not , children are a massive restriction on what you can do while they 're still dependent on you . 
  more & more people are thinking about this & are realizing that the work would not be worth it in the end for them . 
  honestly , i do n't think we 'll be able to encourage 20-something professionals to have children with government moves/benefits alone for decades , if ever . 
  right now the 20s are seen as a decade to finish schooling , hone independent living skills , have a little fun , & work on becoming established in a career , which not many people with professional promise want to risk sullying with the vastly increasing cost & work involved with childrearing . 
  the world of over half a century ago helped with enforcing the old norm of having children in your 20s because women/wives were expected to stay home , pop out kids , & focus on housekeeping . 
  this created a demographic of people that were more willing to consider children at a younger age , because most of them did n't have professional aspirations they wanted to maintain . 
  if we look at who 's having kids in their 20s or younger , especially in the us , it 's mostly poorer , uneducated types who have not set up serious educational or professional career paths . 
  these people generally do n't have anything very significant to lose by having kids young ( er ) . 
  bar the paternity leave , western europe did do a lot of this back in the 1950s-60s & it helped to keep couples popping out children . 
  unfortunately , costs grew a lot to keep the programs running & now its is n't anywhere near as financially feasible to maintain both pro-child benefits & say , universal health care , without raising taxes very high to pay for everything . 
  everywhere ( especially places that had a `` baby boom '' coupled with an amazing economy during the 1950s-60s such as the us & western europe ) has been spoiled by the longtime reality that if humans wanted to fuck , they would need to accept having children due to birth control not being the greatest compared to later , in addition to raising a `` family '' being the accepted social norm . 
  after hearing decades of media & our peers/neighbors complaining about how difficult & consuming parenting is as well as having first-hand knowledge of parents not being the most enthusiastic/good for the job , do you think modern adults are going to dive headfirst into the task if it 's not de facto mandatory for them to do so ? 
  upvote for the username . 
  sweden 's government are fucking idiots . 
  that entire country in general is waaaaaaayyyyyyyy too sheltered & naive for its own good . 
  because of this , the key places to worry about in regards to long-term negative effects from zika right now are latin/south american countries where due to religious influence , it is extremely difficult to prevent pregnancy & carrying fetuses to term for most women . 
  should someone in say , the us , catch zika they technically can stay on birth control & plan to conceive a child several months after successfully beating the disease through treatment . 
  someone in say , ecuador or san salvador , does not have this option & thus should they catch zika , unless they have the money to go abroad for reproductive care , they are most likely stuck conceiving & carrying a child though they themselves still have the disease . 
  you can imagine the culture clash this has caused with the general expectation that spouses have sex & produce lots of children . 
  it does n't remotely help that sexual assault tends to be high in these countries , either . 
  if a fetus contracts zika from its mother in the womb & makes it to birth , chances are great that they will be born with [ microcephaly ] ( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1c1jzap_enus679us682&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=microcephaly ) , which in most cases results in severe disability in addition to numerous life-threatening medical problems . 
  unless these countries either permit termination/abortion in the case of zika infection , greatly improve birth control offerings so that women can avoid getting pregnant until things are under control , or introduce a system of `` mercy-killing '' ( though this could well incure accidental human rights abuses ) infants born with microcephaly due to zika , they could very well be looking at a severe public health problem in addition to accidental human rights abuses in dealing with these babies/children due to national poverty . 
  already have one :  a \u00b7 mer \u00b7 i \u00b7 can \u00b7 ize \u0259\u02c8merik\u0259\u02ccn\u012bz / verb make american in character or nationality . 
  `` trying to americanize the immigrant children '', 
  it 's missing the labels , though . 
  not everybody can easily tell which place each country-person is representing .
