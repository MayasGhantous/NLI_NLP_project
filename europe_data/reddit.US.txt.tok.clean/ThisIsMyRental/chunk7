  kinda figures that logo would air eurovision ... * but holy fuck why would they do that . 
  can this actually be its own main post , with labels for all the countries ? 
  good luck finding a way to pay for it with your fighting off an invasion from russia , bud . 
  it totally reminds me of an oscars musical performance !, 
  holy shit !!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  xddddddddddd, 
  * wow * , your leaders fucking * suck . 
  that meme is fucking hilarious . 
  thank you for enlightening me . 
  pink bubbles for everyone !, 
  what the fuck are your leaders smoking ?!?!, 
  at least boris johnson 's out . 
  * thank you * for understanding the true meaning of social liberalism . 
  everyone deserves a fair chance in life , not just the dark-skinned/not christian types . 
  holy shit . 
  that sounds like a great plan , actually . 
  actually do what they should 've done in the first place & spread out the immigrant/new minority population so they are n't able to turn whole town-sized areas into clones of their old country . 
  that would be the even smarter thing to do , have both the non-native and native speakers be able to move forward at a similar pace . 
  but then again , that would require either bussing non-native speakers to different schools/school districts or making the non-native speaking families settle so that they are spread out and surrounded by native-speakers . 
  a lot of people seem to think those would be racist , and we ca n't be * racist * now can we ? 
  how exactly do you define `` modern '' christianity ? 
  because there are sects of current mainstream christianity in the us who advocate disallowing abortion and even most birth control , women being sahm baby factories , and men being the `` breadwinners '' who are the bosses of their household . 
  sounds like the smart thing to do in that case , not have the non-native speakers drag down the native-speakers who just so happen to be living in that school 's district . 
  reminds me a bit of how many american schools have the gifted , average , and very special ed students all in the same classroom . 
  normal and gifted students often lose out by the teacher needing to go at the pace of the special ed students because schools ca n't have any students failing . 
  still disgusting how a school is allowed to teach blatantly discriminatory idealogy in a western country such as the us in the name of religion . 
  sweden finally taking a stand against a muslim immigrant population not respecting its liberal values ? 
  * holy shit !, 
  i fucking love british `` newspapers '' . 
  i would hate to not be able to get off after a flash of vag . 
  i feel for you . 
  that 's ... interesting . 
  i 'm assuming they do n't shave/trim down there ? 
  are roma/gypsies proud of the fact that they breastfeed or what ? 
  because there 's like 2 or 3 photos out of 39 where a roma/gypsy mom holding out her tit while her kid breastfeeds . 
  yeah , i wonder if this is going to influence her plans in any way . 
  happy st. paddy 's day , friends !, 
  the us is n't `` civilized '' ? 
  i love the lights . 
  it was a good move to keep them up year-round !, 
  the 15th amendment ( 1870 ) was the one that expressly said that all ( male at the time ) us citizens would be able to vote regardless of race . 
  that was the law that went unenforced in the south . 
  may sane turkey remain strong !, 
  wow !, 
  that actually looks really cool , what with the light-up things and all !, 
  wait , other countries do n't ban felons/prisoners from voting ? 
  yep , the 1962 date is when all races could vote in australia . 
   in australia the true universal suffrage ( regardless of race ) was n't achieved until 1962 . 
  by that definition of `` universal suffrage '' , the us would not really achieve it until 1965 because that was when the voting rights act was signed into law , protecting all citizens ' right to vote regardless of race . 
  from 1952 ( when all asian americans could become citizens and vote ) citizens of all races could de jure enjoy universal suffrage , however the government was turning a blind eye to practices in the south including poll taxes , literacy tests , grandfather laws , and just plain racist violence that whites used to keep african americans from voting . 
  the voting rights act expressly forbid all of this . 
  happy international women 's day , everyone !, 
  how can i resist you ? 
  fellow ` baller , i presume ? 
  sweet !, 
  one more city that can accurately say it 's dwarfed by a subreddit !, 
  only if you want to . 
  living in prague still makes you an american of birth . 
  here i go again !, 
  we shall tower over the world together !, 
  ah man , does n't it feel great to be able to mention polandball without being paranoid that the mods 'll find out and ban you ? 
  fo those that are curious , / r/polandball & / r/latvianjokes . 
  about fucking time . 
  are n't those a driving hazard ? 
  i thought those were banned whilw driving already ? 
  never heard of these !, 
  first heard of him when i was in high school !, 
  i watched the animated segment of that !, 
  these were n't all that common or ubiquitous in the us when i was growing up . 
  i think there might have been one or two issues in my high school 's library , however the first time i read asterix was online when i was like 17 years old . 
  my first asterix comic was * asterix in britain . 
  *  have n't seen any of the movies yet . 
  yaaay , members in your government !, 
  great on the romanian people for standing up against this !, 
  sucks horriby that your government just took 5 miles backwards , though . 
  hope things improve for you common guys soon !, 
  * thank you . 
  futas for everyone , then !, 
  2016 's ssa data wo n't be out until feb-april , i 'm guessing . 
  ** social security administration data for 2015 : ** ** girls ( # 1 , ... , # 10 ) : ** ** emma , olivia , sophia , ava , isabella , mia , abigail , emily , charlotte , harper ** ** boys ( # 1 , ... , # 10 ) : ** ** noah , liam , mason , jacob , william , ethan , james , alexander , michael , benjamin **, 
  my friend told me about this at the mall this afternoon . 
  i told her , * `` not another one . 
  ** happy birthday , finland !, 
  this fucking pisses me off * so much * . 
  [ oh man , have you seen this comic yet ? 
  turkey = ( future ? ), 
  shitty islamic theocracy, 
  ** rape is a terrible , violating experience , no matter where or to whom it happens . 
  `` spoiled western feminists '' are pointing out how just how destructive it is to the victim . 
  at the level of horror that rape is , there 's really no goddamn contest for `` the biggest crime in the universe '' , they are all horrendous and need to be stopped . 
  so beautiful !, 
  it 's a very nice picture . 
  lady is n't looking too bad either . 
  well that 's nice that at least some of you guys are n't sweltering at work like you are at home . 
  i 'm jut wondering , is there anywhere in europe where ac is n't all that common in offices ? 
  lucky guy !, 
   french flair  has ac in office, 
  i 'm talking about poland , considering that 's the place that just limited access to the morning-after pill . 
  and i did exaggerate a little on a woman 's risk of being raped , but people can and do get raped at otherwise innocuous parties with date rape drugs . 
  marital/other abuse rape exists as well .
