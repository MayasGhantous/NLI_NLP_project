  why he left so abruptly is unknown .

  pfft . . ukraine will be a better russia than russia ever was, 
  you are always bound to get a fair share of outside psychopaths joining the war . 
  same with foreign fighters joining isis . 
  they only want to kill and rape , the cause they are fighting for is the last thing on their minds . 
  i hope you mean the russian government , not the nation itself . 
  i am really at a loss for words when it comes to our corporate owned media outlets . 
  more people are dying from bullets than ebola , yet ebola is all we here about . 
   there are so many parallels between what happened in croatia in 1991/95 and what is happening in ukraine . 
  it 's actually quite uncanny . 
  apple does n't fall far from the tree . 
  ( referring to russia and their little bro ) ah the comments on that video page . 
  seems like the hate for croats is alive and well ...

  excellent retort , sweden . 
   serbia wants both to be happy is serbia aiming to be the switzerland of the balkans ?

  nice shot though . 
  ( tips cowboy hat ), 
  let me get muh freedom in on this . 
  so russia will be getting an influx of north koreans ? 
  we will war you !, 
  the classical music , fine vodka , rich history , survived history ( stalin , wwii , fall of ussr . . etc ) , the many contributed [ inventions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:russian_inventions ) and let 's not forget russian dash-cam footage . 
  in the song , x are croats and bosnians . 
  its a catchy genocidal song .

  it 's getting louder !,

  iraq , iran ... the middle east in general . 
  upon reading you comment i was shocked to find a well balanced explanation . 
  but when reaching the last paragraph , the shock subsided . 
  there 's the classic crnaruka we know and love !, 
  russia is in eu ? 
   a piece of land in croatia that 's technically serbia , but because neither serbia nor croatia claim it as their own , it 's technically no mans land . 
  are there any inhabitants there ? 
  who do they pay tax to ? 
  its as if a croat and a serb got intoxicated one night and went on to struggle drawing coherent lines . 
  history dictates it is you defiling mine . 
  it 's okay . 
  just let him have his moment . 
  i see . 
  the map is based on where the laureates were present when awarded . 
  ivo andric was a croat born in bosnia . 
  why is he listed under serbia ? 
  andric and prelog make sense for bosnia being that bosnia was their place of birth . 
  this could just as easily be any country side in europe . 
  i need proof before i can upvote . 
  rs looks like a smaller rotated croatia and are both devouring bosnia !, 
  fellow patriot , what is this nonsense ? 
  was this colored in with a digital crayon ? 
  update : you have shown great improvement . 
  here 's looking at you kid . 
  his silence is deafening !, 
  what a worldly individual . 
  bandi\u0107 even has the face of a villain . 
  what is going on there ? 
  perfect choice of gif . 
  do n't cry because it 's over . 
  smile because it happened . 
  mimica , you on fire !, 
  not sure why you are being down-voted . 
  the comment section on the article 's website is a cesspool . 
   what he said earlier is so over the top i think its too much even for him . 
  look at his posting history . 
  it will ethnically cleanse your optimism . 
  slovenia is the only former yugoslavian nation without blood on their hands . 
   the only country found guilty for aggression in the yu [ goslav ] wars was croatia heh ? 
  my mistake , it 's 170,000 , not 170,00 euros worth , hehe . 
  but it makes me all warm inside . 
  well that 's just mean . 
   americans even manage to piss off other americans to great efficiency it 's true , i can attest . 
   and still it was ethnic cleansing . 
  did n't say it was n't ethnic cleansing , but it was n't the largest since wwii , as you falsely stated . 
   `` to defend my people , `` in my name '' who are you quoting ? 
   you have that problem have what problem ? 
  you have no problem condemning ( in paragraphs ) crimes made by croats but fail to mention the other crucial members of the equation . 
  the fact that you are getting so `` defensive '' is comical . 
  please do n't make the same mistake we continue to make on a daily bases . 
   unbiased good luck . 
  best thing is to just cross reference multiple news sources to weed out the colored in truths . 
  not sure how the title relates to the quote ? ... 
   carl bildt , eu negotiator , even said that croatia carried out `` most efficient ethnic cleansing in the yugoslav wars . '', 
  true , mainly because it resulted in minimal casualties . 
  keep in mind when jna forces retreated , many serbians left in fear that croats and other non-serbs would seek revenge for the 1991 incident . 
  also he said most efficient , not largest . 
  that goes to the 170,000 croats and non-serbs forced out of their homes in serbia krajina as i stated in a previous reply to you . 
  edit : 170,000 let 's be honest . 
  the formation of serbian krajina . 
  here is why operation storm happened . 
  `` a wider-scale war was launched in august 1991 . 
  over the following months , a large area of territory , amounting to a third of croatia , was controlled by the rebel serbs . 
  the croatian population suffered heavily , fleeing or evicted with numerous killings , leading to ethnic cleansing . 
  [ 16 ] the bulk of the fighting occurred between august and december 1991 when approximately 80,000 croats were expelled ( and some were killed ) . 
  [ 17 ] many more died and or were displaced in fighting in eastern slavonia ( this territory along the croatian/serbian border was not part of the krajina , and it was the jna that was the principal actor in that part of the conflict ) . 
  the total number of exiled croats and other non-serbs range from 170,000 ( icty ) [ 18 ] up to a quarter of a million people ( human rights watch ) .
