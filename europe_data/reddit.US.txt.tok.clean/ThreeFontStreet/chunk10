  no doubt you would have been great use to karadzic and mladic . 
  perhaps the bosnian death toll would triple with your help . 
   very passionate anti-nazism in my case . 
  lol , nope you are just evil , sorry . 
   you are not nazi child like 99 % of balkan fuckers here are . 
  especially croats . 
  wow , you should apply to become a un peacekeeper . 
  they do n't know you are serbian or jewish , you have a bosnian flair ... also how are 99 % of croats nazis if 50 % ( of who voted in elections ) voted hdz ? 
  man you are sociopath . 
  / u/kradem is the one who posted this link . 
  he even chastised those who try to change the subject to serbia and says croatia must acknowledge it has a problem . 
  even agree with the other guy that the phrase zds should be banned as have i. 
  but if a croat says it , it does n't mean shit to you does it ? 
  for it would ruin the romance of hatred you hold so dear for the croats . 
  those make up the minority in serbia . 
  serbs are the majority . 
  like i said still pretty prevalent . 
  86 % of the 90 % ethnic croatia plus ( other 4.4 % ( including bosniak , hungarian , slovene , czech ) are catholic . 
  religion is still relevant in both . 
   here 's an interesting anecdote : the austrian hypo bank is/was in b&h . someone had an idea to create a hippopotamus mascot and promote children 's accounts and savings in the serbian entity in b&h . they called the mascot hypko . 
  when it got to a school in banja luka , the children started happily chanting `` nurko !, 
  '' , because they have n't been taught to learn the latin alphabet ; only and only cyrillic . 
   that 's just the tip of the iceberg . 
  they live in b&h yet ca n't read latin writen language . 
  are they that much of isolationists ? 
  i see . 
  so the `` spremni '' part is the part added on by the ustase ? 
  and then the west ruined everything . 
  as if facts matter . 
  the heart is all that matters . 
  you 're talking to a brick wall . 
  do n't waste any more of your time . 
  perhaps europe or us will prevent one from happenning this time as apposed to acting when it has been to late . 
  i mean , history never repeaats , right ? ... ... ... right ? 
  the orthodoxy was and is still pretty prevelent no ? 
  85 % identify as it even though 83 % of serbia is rthnic serb . 
   serbian nationalist have been using croatian neonazi problem to insult croatians , so it 's hard to distinguish is it true anti-nationalism or just serbian nationalism . 
  admittedly , i have run into such conflict of thought due to past encounters . 
  still wether it is politics or not , it still should be discussed . 
  all of it . 
  including problems on other sides . 
  they also said that za dom - spremni !, 
  ( for the homeland - ready ! ), 
  can be a `` double sided '' greeting , that it can also express just `` patriotism '' . 
  probably due to its missuse in the 90s as `` patriotic lingo '' . 
  uneducated people who tried to redefine its meaning . 
  as they should . 
  will have a look at this later . 
  may prove insightful . 
  ethnic croat here . 
  can confirm am sub-human . 
  impeccable logic ... 
  is this the russian diplomacy to be utilized in ukraine ? 
  so by that logic , had the serbs in bosnia not caused a ruckus , bosnia would be in the eu sooner and had serbs not caused such a ruckus in croatia , croatia would have joined sooner . 
  around 84 % of serbs in serbia claim yo be orthofox christians . 
  as to how christian , one ca n't tell . 
  but appears a significant ar part of the church , as are croats with the catholic church , but seems to be in the decline for both . 
  edit : spelling, 
   only some of the neo-ustashi will babble how zds is `` historical '' ( it 's not , there was no recorded use of zds before 1941 ) or from some 19th century opera , which is especially funny when you know how typical ustashi fan looks like ( google images for `` thompson koncert '' ) . 
  i do n't condone the use of the greeting and think it should be banned as hate speach , but for historical sake , was it not coined before the ustase took power in 1941 ? 
  it was used as a battle cry during ottoman battle times , so i , ve been told . 
  either eay it has been tainted by the ustase . 
  [ the words za dom ( `` for home '' or `` for homeland '' ) were used in pavao ritter vitezovi\u0107 's 1684 work odiljenje sigetsko about the battle of szigetv\u00e1r , [ 16 ] in the opera nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 zrinjski composed by ivan zajc in 1876 , [ 17 ] and several songs published in the mid-19th century issues of the danica , the literary magazine published with the early narodne novine . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] . 
  [ 21 ] the phrase za dom was documented as a salute in a 1939 issue of a vara\u017edin weekly hrvatsko jedinstvo . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/za_dom_spremni ) also , why no flair ? 
   edit : why are people so offened by this comment ? 
  mearly checking with the guy if what i read on wiki was accurate . 
  people should learn to read before downvoting . 
  no , it was probably because you keep spouting hate towards croats , acting like croatia is an ndh 2.0 . 
  instead of civil conversation , which you are now taking part of which is nice to see . 
  peolle are more likely to listen depending on how you convey the information . 
  very modern looking office . 
  so ... clean . 
  sorry , bassist . 
  only did quick glance . 
  america has it . 
  it 's called american exceptionalism , for we are to embarrassed to just call it nationalism . 
  nationalism is a disease pretty much anyone can be vulnerable to . 
  problem is the way people convene them on this subreddit . 
  civil conversation is what is needed . 
  making racist or bigoted remarks as apposed to calm and well though out debates is the problem . 
  there are crack-houses in detroit that look more convincing . 
   i 'd genocide western ukraine for those eyes < 3 [ oh you dog you ] ( http://i833.photobucket.com/albums/zz251/eddy5050/patrick-bateman-upvote_zps44eebd1e.gif ), 
  is she actually someone that is listened to or just some underground self proclaimed reporter ? 
  this is a parody right ? 
  this is a joke ? 
  ah , i know i said i would not respond anymore , but i want to make some things clear . 
  also  few days ago he made a proposition that one day should be picked to comemorate all the victims of the 90s wars . 
  well yeah , now he is singing a different tune after the backlash he received even from citizens of his own country . 
  how long this phase will stay and how serious he is remains to be proven . 
  pusic even made a quote saying that serbs who left or were forced to leave in 95 ' should of course comeback , saying that this is just as much their country as croats . 
  man , i 'm not trying to put your country down , i hold croatia accountable for such things also !, 
  but it is quite obvious that your politicians also tend to do the same thing . 
  opening old wounds for points . 
  as are croatian politicians . 
   our politicains do n't live in the 90s . 
  it 's 2015 and bitching about croatia wo n't win you any votes around here anymore . 
  sorry , disagree . 
  both sides do . 
  did you not read all the quotes i posted from your top two politicians ?
