  not all on both sides , but they are there . 
  there is still bitching about croatia . 
  i see it in the news quoting various political figures . 
   because there 's nothing ` good ' about '' oluja '' . 
  ... whatever ` good ' you think ` oluja ' accomplished it does n't come anywhere near to the bad . 
  that 's sounds very off . 
  almost like something seselj would say . 
  could you educate me on the overwhelmingly bad the operastion storm was compared to the 170,000 croats and non-serbs expelled or killed from krajina in 92 ' and 93 ' and the continues expansion into croatia ? 
  croats dont look postively at the war crimes comitted by some soldiers but at the victory of defending their territory and stopping expansion and violence into the country . 
  hard to argue that , sorry . 
  [ this is what i vase most of my knowledge on for i deem it neutral ] , ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm )  return of croatian refugees could 've been acomplished through peaceful means do explain how ? 
  since it is so simple . 
  the whole croatian war could have been avoided if serbs in krajina did n't turn violent . 
  i mean why stop at 95 ' ? 
   few days ago he made a proposition that one day should be picked to comemorate all the victims of the 90s wars . 
  yeah then he went straight into going on about serbian victims , no one else . 
  he is all talk , now let 's see action . 
   croatian government imidiatly said no ` cuz our victims are better than yours , dude ' . 
  that is a overly simple way of looking at things . 
   yeah , that 's his pov . 
  ummm , you get upset about croatian politicians having one view ( understandably so ) but okay with vucic doing so ? 
  that is the problem . 
  they both lack the other side 's view !, 
   do you consider ndh precursor of the modern day croatia ? 
  i do n't since it is not deemed the legal successor of the ndh but croatia is of the socialist state of croatia formed in 1943 . 
  but i do n't understand what that has to do with anything . 
  serbia is the successor of yugoslavia . 
  hence why they get shit for what milosevic and jna forces did sadly . 
  when i speak of genocide i am referring to rebel serbs in bosnia , let that be clear . 
  i am not saying serbia organised or milosevic even a genocide to take place . 
  though he did nothing to stop it and willingly supplied arms to some messed up individuals . 
   they like to call republika srpska ` genocidal creation ' and say that something like that should n't exist . 
  of course , pushing things in that direction will only lead to another war , but i 'm afraid that the big part of bosniaks is warming up to the idea . 
  lets be honest , rs was founded in the 90 's and formed out of ethnic cleansing and genocide because it was not as purely serbian before in that region as it is now . 
  those people did not flee , they were forced out or executed . 
  ** but , that does not mean rs can not exist there . 
  ** i believe it should and has to exist there . 
  one reason is obviously stability . 
  no doubt serbs will raise hell if it were to no longer exist . 
  and two , ** for many people it is home ** . 
  borders change , regions change inhabitants , is but a part of human history . 
  it is important to look to the future . 
  also come on , you are painting bosniaks as war mongers . 
  seems to me all sides have guns loaded for another fight . 
  one would think they learn from history . 
  problem is people keep changing and denying history , hence history repeating itself . 
   because , like i said the whole thing is being primarly used as a political weapon . 
  huh ? 
  like i said , acknowledge and move on . 
  that is more respectable then denial . 
  i am all for a day to commemorate ** all ** victims . 
  and i mean ** all ** . 
  no dick measuring for who had it the worst , no denying of war crimes , and no celebrating of convicted war criminals . 
  but if people will continue to make statements like `` operation storm was pure evil and croat had no right to defend their land , was pure genocide '' ( even though almost 170,000 croats and non-serbs were kicked out by force or killed from krajina before and serbs there refused to negotiate or settle for anything peacful other than annexation of croatian land including knin , croatia 's kosovo ) or `` serbia carried out genocide , they are the only bad guys and are monsters , they wanted to dominate world '' ( even though it was actually mladic and karadzic and rebel serbs in bosnia rs who did this and there is no proof linking milosevic to it nor the serbian state . 
  also albanians in kosovo were turning violent and forcing serbs to flee many cleansed or killed , resulting in a more ethnically pure albanian kosovo yet the west sided with them over the serbs and gave them a country [ still pending ] ) . 
   +1 i am glad you agree with my last part . 
  had enough talking about this political nonsense . 
  you have your views , i have mine . 
  i just hope you can try to see the other side of the war not just the serbian side . 
  like operation storm ( or oluja ) . 
  just like i try to understand the serbian view of the war and why they did or felt they had to do what they did . 
  you seem like a fair person , and based on your responses , you do n't seem to have much bias in this , which i greatly respect . 
  by being open minded , that is what will bring peace . 
  okay , now i 'm really finished with the conversation , hehe . 
  i did n't plan to write this much , but i wanted to reply to a lot of the things you said . 
  i do n't want to waste any more time on these politicians . 
  why is the west balkans a parrot ? 
  quite the abstract artist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynxncpd2zsq, 
  you can tell the guitarist on the right is really getting into the jam . 
   i keep reading in that europe failure is treated very harshly . 
  yeah , noticed that also . 
  i always figure failure was part of the process of trying to start a successful venture . 
  many of the top dogs in in the business world have had failures . 
  part of the process , i think . 
   no i did n't , and no they do n't . 
  you wrote `` that might be so '' . 
   that 's more than any croatian or bosniak politician did . 
  multiple presidents paid visit to the jasenovac memorial site . 
  so serbian presidents should pay visit to corresponding memorials . 
  even though at first your pm denied a genocide took place , but also said there is no need for him to visit anyway . 
  only later after public pressure did he go . 
   they still actually claim that the civil war was a black and white disney fairytale where they were obviously the '' good guys '' and the sole victims . 
  now that is n't healthy . 
  seems you are the one with a black and white view : vucic said about operation storm remembrance day [ `` i told them myself that it would be an insult , because we believe there is nothing to celebrate that day , '' vucic told reporters . 
  '' ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/croatian-serbian-officials-trade-barbs-over-storm-celebration ) that is quite the one sided view . 
  assuming serbs were the only victims and the only one in danger while ignoring what happened to croats living in krajina . 
  and that the operation did n't also get croatian refugees their homes and loved one 's bodies back to bury . 
  it was not just serbian victims as the pm likes to play it . 
  but humanizing croats is not his forte . 
  also   [ before splitting away from the radical party of vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj , aleksandar vu\u010di\u0107 was openly and publicly celebrating and calling for the protection of ratko mladi\u0107 , a military leader accused of committing war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . 
  in 2007 , while mladi\u0107 was still at large in serbia , vu\u010di\u0107 was distributing posters stating `` safe house for general mladi\u0107 '' . 
  during a parliament session he stated that the serbian parliament will always protect and be a safe house for the general and that any house in serbia that bears the last name of vu\u010di\u0107 will protect and shelter mladi\u0107 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandar_vu%c4%8di%c4%87#ratko_mladi.c4.87 ) the guy vetoed genocide recognition . 
  and as for your president : [ `` during the 1990s and until 2008 , nikoli\u0107 repeatedly called for the creation of a greater serbia . 
  [ 29 ] [ 30 ] nikoli\u0107 told a zagreb paper in 2004 that the boundaries of greater serbia along the virovitica-karlovac-karlobag line were not part of any imperialistic politics , but would always remain a `` dream '' for him and other radical leaders . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomislav_nikoli%c4%87#greater_serbia ) how is saying such things good politics ? 
  [ `` in a may 2012 interview , nikoli\u0107 was quoted by frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to have said that \u2033 vukovar was a serb city and croats have nothing to go back to there \u2033 . 
  [ 41 ] croatian president ivo josipovi\u0107 criticized nikoli\u0107 for this statement and conditioned future cooperation on nikoli\u0107 's withdrawal of the statement . 
  [ 42 ] '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomislav_nikoli%c4%87#vukovar_statements ) and funny you mention seselj , since both your pm and president were buddy buddies with the psychopath back in the 90s . 
  vucic even calling for 100 muslims killed for every serb dead .
