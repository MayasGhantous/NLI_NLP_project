  i think you mistook my comment for something else . 
  and there are articles , videos , politicians , people , and etc who said vile things about russians , croats , bosnians , albanians , bulgarians , germans , americans , serbians , poles , chinese , japanese , etc. 
  croats were subjugated to being the `` bad guy '' in the media as well . 
  but not to the extent that serbs were . 
  that i know . 
  events such as srebrenica are probably why . 
  not saying it is right , just that it is probably why . 
  there is no bad guy . 
  just criminals . 
   the serbs , are two-dimensional people with a craving for simplicity and an ideology so basic it can be understood without effort . 
  they need enemies , not friends , to focus their two-dimensional ideas . 
  life for them is a simple tune , never an orchestration , or even a pleasant harmony . 
  animals make use of their resources with far greater felicity than these retorted creatures , whose subscription to the human race is well in arrears . 
  peter ustinov , the european , 10 june 1993  is this kind of speech about whole nations normal ? 
  reporting crimes is one thing , but speeches like this one i quoted are outright fascistic and dehumanising ? 
  of course not . 
  he seems like he is writing his very on mein kampf . 
  he is a sick man . 
  and bob dyaln directly compared all croats to kkk , slave drivers , nazis . 
  as if being croatian is in itself a sin . 
  [ julia gorin ] ( http://www.juliagorin.com/wordpress/ ) vehemently anti-croat but fuck 'em . 
  let them think that . 
  normal people know better . 
  read the links , knew all except for slovenia , hehe . 
  that surprised me . 
  i know about the mud slinging that went on . 
  second link talks about what was in first link , which i know about . 
  though the ` there must be justice '' website in general , seems a teeny weeny bit biased . 
  i prefer neutral sources . 
  again , only brought up serbian media because that was the guy i was replying to 's topic of choice . 
  he/she is asking if the croatian variant is truly a different `` written language '' than the glagolic used by other slavic territories . 
  from what i see , it is simply different fonts or art styles . 
  guy is being a dick , never mind him . 
  from what i read in this article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glagolitic_alphabet glagolitic alphabet was used by a number of slavic countries :  the words that denote glagolitic alphabet in the main slavic languages are as follows : bulgarian , russian , macedonian \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 ( glagolitsa / glagolica ) , belarusian \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0446\u0430 ( h\u0142aholica ) , croatian glagoljica , serbian \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0459\u0438\u0446\u0430 / glagoljica , czech hlaholice , polish g\u0142agolica , slovene glagolica , slovak hlaholika , and ukrainian \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044f ( hlaholycia ) . 
  it seems like languages , the writing systems had variations , but a relative core . 
  your comparisons as fonts appears accurate !, 
  it seems though that the glagolitic croatian variant ( approximate by region ) font is what the game was basing on . 
  one that stands out is the mushroom shape that seems specific to [ croatian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/bascanska_ploca.jpg ) from what i see . 
  serbians used glagolitic to an extent , but cyrillic was the dominant form and obviously took over as the main form of writing . 
  the developers pretty much just randomly chose some font , perhaps even combined different fonts as well . 
  really a bizarre and fascinating writing system . 
  sorry , location should n't matter if you disagree with someone . 
  bitterness about nato bombings is understandable . 
  but anger about jounalists exposing war crimes ? 
  guy should be mad at the criminals not thr media for reporting on the criminals . 
  you dont see croats up in arms all the time on reddit for croatian war crimes being reported ... 
  agreed , using old conflicts to justify future ones is foolish and dangerouse . 
  ah the victimization anthem !, 
   this song was created during the bosnian war as a kind of irony and famous serbian defiance , because at the time of the media demonized the serbs and talked all the worst perhaps atrocious war crimes caught on photos and video of serbian rebels had something to do with it ? 
  croatian war crimes were also reported on . 
   while our media tried unsuccessfully to break through the blockade , and show us in a better light that is because propaganda and deceit can only last so long . 
  serbian beach front . 
  i thought it was because when you take the croatian coat of arms of the croatian flag it looks like the netherlands flag . 
  [ kosovo right now ... ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/68/ea/9a/68ea9a69dba3765d4caf78d371babf51.gif ), 
  oh snap , you went there . 
  a corporatized dubrovnik ? 
  ** dubrovnik \u2122 \u00a9 ** * presented by china international stock & trade *, 
  seem to have disintegrated in the sun . 
  yes lets lobby and bribe like honest adults !, 
  corruption should truly be the european standard for life . 
   ( possibly by croatian spies ) was n't the audio file leaked from someone from slovenia ? 
  yeah , damn android phone keeps ~ ~ combing ~ ~ my words . 
  edit : combining, 
  to be fair croatia has the strangest , most weird ass shape of the ex-yugo states . 
  problems abound to happen . 
  by the way , can croatia and serbia just turn liberland into a storage shed already ? 
  thos guys are annoying to read about . 
  dat damage control, 
  i mentioned my nationality . 
  you are still british . 
  a british citizen . 
  a british national . 
  but i 'm the dumb american so whatever . 
  article does say the page was edited though . 
  east london is not in england ? 
  anyways , ca n't you just admit '' hey , you think you are in the right , i think i am in the right , instead of insulting one another lets act somewhat civil and agree to disagree ? '', 
  or do you get joy from these pointless arguments ? 
  oh sorry , fixed my comment so had resubmit . 
  yep , attack my nationality . 
  as if a brit is one to talk . 
  always right , never wrong or can admit defeat ? 
  you make judgments based of a paragraph out of an entire entry . 
  but do keep changing the subject . 
  perhaps have your state of mind reevaluated while you 're at it ? 
  do keep the low brow insults coming though , they are adorable !, 
  yawwwwn ... oh and thanks for trying to revive a dead conversation . 
  no doubt you 've been waiting for it , yet i had already forgotten what we were talking about . 
  no arguments left as expected i see . 
  just insults all around . 
  the bullshitter is bulshitted out . 
  seems others agree . 
  great , well though out argument !, 
  yep , the world is truly black & white . 
  people like you are surely the ones who would have cooled down the tensions in the balkans back then . 
  all i have said is true . 
  without having to insult anyone , beside bringing up or poor literacy . 
  thanks for continuing an old conversation though . 
  seems you really do live in the past . 
  go find someone else to continue your pointless hate filled ramblings . 
  i 've moved on buddy .
