  yes you convinced me . 
  croats are nazi scum . 
  they deserve what ever serbs did to them . 
  and zero croats . 
  point is i do n't see how croatia embraces nazism . 
  do n't recall hearing about croat nazi 's heading to fight for ukraine as serb chetniks are for pro-russian separatists . 
  the sooner you stop living in the past , the better . 
  this coming from a guy calling all croats nazis bas on something that happed 70 years ago ... at least the they are n't trying to hide or deny their history . 
  no other place i 'd rather be . 
  `` a poll shows that as many as 81 per cent of serbians believe they lived best in the former yugoslavia '' hmmm ... now do they miss communism or actually just miss yugoslavia . 
  to different things . 
  no more black market livers for you russia !, 
  is n't scotland already its own nation just under the united kingdom just as serbia , croatia , bosnia , slovenia , montenegro and macedonia were under yugoslavia ? 
  if anything , serbs should use kosovo as a precedent for a separate state . 
  we need more of these !, 
  i 'd support it to . 
  that and the secession of what used to be croatian republic . 
  but this leaves bosnia fragmented which could lead to conflict . 
  though would you support the absorption of rs into serbian and cr into croatia as appose to being independent states ? 
  our crops thank you , europe !, 
  the balkans are known for their pacifists . 
  here is a famous [ serbian good samaritan arkan ] ( http://www.pulsonline.rs/data/images/2011-01-16/4323_1_orig.jpg?ver=1295134136 ), 
  true . 
  but lets no kid ourselves into thinking they are equally untrustworthy , that 's all . 
   i 'm saying that both sides have a history of lies , deceit and manipulation to suit their interests and that neither of them should be blinedely trusted . 
  except one side is quite a bit more trustworthy than the other . 
  who 's grave is this ? 
  appears crnaruka 's alter ego manifested itself 2 months ago . 
  one account was n't enough cerni ? 
   you gon na win the same way we won against nato . 
  huh ? 
  only after labor day . 
  you really went out of your way to find that one , did n't you ... 
  finally , a comment of yours that i agree on . 
  actually you could . 
  each states has its own culture/mentality . 
  each is like a smaller nation banded under a larger governing body . 
  almost like an eu or something . 
  the black hand strikes again . 
  ladies and gentlemen , we found our next [ vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vojislav_%c5%a0e%c5%a1elj ), 
   the other half have a weird love-hate relationship . 
  bosnian serbs ? 
   edit for those who are not familiar with what transpired , this is the kind of shit that op is so thrilled about . 
  do n't recall croats following islam . 
  the genocidal maniacs in the video shout `` alah akbar '' . 
  then again , considering your username i am not surprised at your disregard for such details . 
   for those who are not familiar with what transpired please do educate us with your unbiased standpoint . 
  mr. black hand . 
  i disregard both croatian and serbian wiki pages . 
  both are run by far right nationalists . 
  okay . 
  and now lets see why operation storm happened to begin with . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_serbian_krajina#mediaviewer/file:demographics_of_rsk.jpg either a mass immigration of serbs or a mass ethnic cleansing of croats . 
  either one seems odd . 
  looking at this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm `` the military operation [ operation storm ] also allowed croatian authorities access to areas where , as of march 2012 , a total of 144 mass and 1,200 individual graves have been discovered , in which a total of 3,809 croatian civilians and military personnel were buried . '', 
  can we stop with the selective memory ? 
  woosh ... 
  to be fair , all fronts did , to put it mildly , `` some fucked up shit '' . 
  edison 's propaganda machine is at it again !, 
  i mean the borders being blocked . 
  croatia does n't have neigbors to pass them along . 
  i was initially talking about the first few days of the ordeal . 
  also they have been having a harder time passing them along , lesser rate . 
  hence the problem croatia is in as apposed to serbia . 
  serbia can pass the migrants , croatia on the other hand is stuck with them . 
  hehe , yep . 
  that is something some refuse to realize . 
  sure its easy to take in refugees ... when you know they will eventually leave too . 
  i though when you said he is , ore sensitive than the nationalists on here , you implied he was not one . 
  nevermind . 
  i agree with your post . 
  hey i 'm on the list . 
  i 'm famous !, 
  what was it ? 
   why is spain so detestable that catalans seek to separate themselves ? 
  i too would like to get a catalan 's view of the situation . 
  well , he is a nationalist no ? 
  proponent for establishing nation of catalonia . 
   you literally speak as if we were different species , dickhead . 
  huh . 
  where did he/she allude different species ? 
  he/she said you are part of the pro separatist group . 
  bok !, 
  i like these similar town posts . 
  someone do another !, 
  yep , all the nation flags seem to match . 
  huh , missed the `` 2003 '' . 
  second part of my comment still stands . 
  ~ ~ took you this long to figure that out , mr. corbyn ? ~ ~ the september 11th attacks were completely abused for sinister ends . 
  edit : missed the 2003 part . 
  should genocide , mass muder and ethnic cleansing not be considered war crimes but just part of war ? 
  that happened during the yugoslav wars . 
  no rules , no limits ? 
  i really do n't see how the two are the same . 
  one is a country , the other is n't , was my point . 
  we have different views of it , lets leave it at that . 
  i meant using precedent of murdering locals to create ypur own nation , which is what he said . 
  should that realy be the standard ? 
   there would n't be this much bitching if someone used a flanders flag to represent ghent , now would there be ? 
  i think it is because of the sensitive issue it is in the balkans due to what happend during the war and so on as for ghent , i would expect the belgian flag listed with other nation flags .
