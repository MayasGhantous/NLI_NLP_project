  that is quite the statement . . 
  has it been raped with preservatives and contain growth hormones ? 
  if not , i 'll pass thanks . 
  of course the celebration is calculated by princes kolinda and here jesters . 
  it is being used to blind croats from real threats facing the country . 
  that i agree with you . 
  nope . 
  the phone message scandle occured after this decision was made . 
  huh ? 
  funny , the comment section of the article said croats better lay out some ciggarettes and a nice shaded place for squatting . 
  is that some stereotype ofnalbanians and montenegrins ? 
  of course there was a refugee crisis . 
  you think when croats celebrate operatio storm it is purley to go '' hahaha suck it serbian families who last their homes ! '' . 
  yes curse the croats evil ways . 
  you are seing this from only one perspective . 
  are russia and poland wrongbfor celebrating victory of defeating germans ? 
  many german civilans fled with instances of crimes being comitted . 
  it is haled as a huge victory though . 
  im not comparing serbs to germans , just that their local krajina officals factual employed ethnic cleansing of croats and killings . 
  pushed into territoy , expansion ans were counter acted with os . 
  the refugee crisis thatbfallowed was horrid . 
  serbs who lived for centuries in croatia lost their holmes . 
  these holmes later occupied by croats expelled from rs and bosnia and other areas . 
  it is more complicated than you make it seem . 
  article says 250,000 . 
  also thousands killed ? 
  when official sources say around 1,000 casualities on serbian side and 250 on croatian side ? 
  of course it is terribe , but does not equal sebrenica . 
  foreign invaders being jna forces . 
  for a guy who talks about politicians twisting words , you are pretty good at it yourself . 
  also really , operation storm = sebrinica ? 
  one was a reaction to thousands of croats kiled , around 170,000 croats forced out of their ancestrial homeland , not just refugees but forced drom 91 to 92 and krajina and jna forces expanding into croatia , almost splitting it in two . 
  the other was the linning up of civilains and executing them . 
  disgusting in deed . 
  you seems desperate to try to equate croatian crimes to serbian ones . 
  operation storm was a war against serbian rebels and jna forces , sebrencia was a pure intended massacre of civilians . 
  how can you honestly say these are the same ? 
  here are the sources i base my views on . 
  let me gues , evul ustase croats run the media right ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_serbian_kraj edit : also , of course people have the right to mourn and be said . 
  but to call it the saddest in serbian history ? 
  are we forgetting jasenovic ? 
  operastio storm was literaly worse ? 
  that was my initial point not the mourning part . 
  also  numerous citizens of serb ethnicity who left croatia at that time are fortunately returning of their own accord because they believe that here they have better living conditions and they are welcome , because this is their country yep croatia is adiment about keeping serbs out . 
  she said this is serbians country too . 
  soo much for spinning the narrative ey ? 
  please ... id expect better than this from you . 
  of course , no denying that . 
  though were is rife , i do n't know . 
  there were definatley a number of instances of crimes commited , looting , murder , destroying property . 
  to make it seem that wad all it was is purely asinine though and most of those responsible were indited . 
  now was it was worse than wwii genocide that serbs experienced ? 
  ok ... vucic said it was the saddest day in serbian history . 
  also , you do know that operation storm was not some evil plan to soley kick out serbs right ? 
  yes war crimes occured , which is fucked , but does that make the operation to reclaim land from which croats where killed or forced out just some pure evil nazi plan for domi ation ? 
  edit : wanted to make it clear , in no way does one crime justify another . 
  nor should events be used to demonize others or abused for politics . 
   serbian prime minister aleksandar vucic 's statement that the anniversary of operation storm , august 5 , was the saddest day in serbia 's history and that candles would be lit on the border crossing raca on the border with bosnia and herzegovina on that day to commemorate the suffering of the serb people . 
  really vucic ? 
  karamarko said one thing i agree with . 
  that croatia is on the path to becoming a `` greece scenario '' . 
  though croatia is n't in the euro zone , so doubt eu will care to much . 
  maybe i 'm cynical . 
  [ american cheese ] ( http://i.livescience.com/images/i/000/052/768/original/american-cheese-120629.jpg ), 
  alright european slaves , fetch me a zesty drink !, 
  i doubt a noble hdz politician such as karamarko would ever abuse history and exploit it for publicity . 
  it is obviousley serbia that is the problem . 
  #endserbianoppression but on a seriouse not operation storm is not as one sided as the article paints it to be . 
  not to mention the nice subtle inflation of refugees . 
  war crimes were commited no doubt , just as it has tgrough the ex-yugo states . 
  the operation itself was not nazi reprisal as some may spin it . 
  for those who are not familiar : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm, 
  if only the balkans liked balkans, 
  i believe sroat or cerb to be more politicly correct terms . 
  everything is bigger in america . 
  disney land \u2122, 
  i agree . 
  i understand the frustration . 
  though serbs get it the most . 
  edit : apparently sympathizing with serbians gets you downvotes on r/europe . 
  perhaps poorly handles was the better term for bosnia . 
  un pretty much stood by . 
  i did n't mean he was infact denying it , just asking what is his stance . 
  was he simply mad at the guy for obviously throwing blame in one direction or does he think there was no fault on the serbian side based on his `` yeah serbs killed jesus to '' comment . 
  was just asking . 
  happy with his answer though . 
  edit : saw the link , yep , know all about it . 
  just want to makes sure both side are acknowledged . 
  dude , [ kosovar albanians had their hand in atrocities as well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_in_the_kosovo_war#massacres ) . 
  what happened is that mafiosos saw the opportunity to seize power and did so . 
  uh , sorry , kosovo `` politicians '' are a whole new low . 
  i think they did , if we are talking about kosovo . 
  other regions were ignored by the west it seems . 
  they did sway milosevic from continuing in kosovo though . 
  though that could be because it became pretty much ethnically albanian by then . 
  just wanted to confirm , you 're sarcasm is aimed at him being a dick and are not denying the link right ?
