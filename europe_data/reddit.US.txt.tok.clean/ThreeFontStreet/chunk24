  except croatia does n't seem to be in it . 
  has croatia attempted to join ? 
   while native population was like : `` wtf those guys actually still exist ? '', 
  i was actually under the impression that those movements were being reignited in the balkans as well during the 90 's , especialy in bosnia among the different etho groups there . 
   you can see this phenomenon mocked in sopranos , when tony and his crew go to italy and get served real italian food ( they find it disgusting ) and get to know real italian customs and traditions , and see how their italian-american identity has very little to do with real italy . 
  great comparison . 
   does n't have to deal with consequences of nationalism nationalists are perhaps the type i most hate . 
  i 'm proud of my heritage , ... to an extent . 
  but i 'm not in-love with it . 
  i am more interested in seeing , as an outsider , the southern slavs be more resilient force in modern day europe . 
  economically and socially . 
  i mean how do croatia 's and serbia 's relations appear today based on news and town talk ? 
  / u/zduhack you have opened my eyes and unclogged my heart . 
  i will cease my sinful ways immediately !, 
  question though . 
  is there any clues that give away a diaspora ? 
  or is it something that only a person from the region can tell ? 
  i mean there are many cro/bos/ser flared users on hear . 
  doubt they are all truthful . 
  also , why do diaspora then to be more volatile than natives ? 
  haha , yep . 
  thanks . 
   at least both croats and serbs agree on one thing : our diasporas suck and you should n't have a right to vote . 
  xd lol , bright side i guess . 
  baby steps . 
   though there are `` real '' croats and serbs that behave as such too on here if their flairs are correct . 
  excluding yourself . 
  i misunderstood . 
  sorry , just a jerk reaction based on past replies i have gotten in the past . 
  people claiming `` you are diaspora , so your opinion is wrong anyway '' as if facts have a geographical location . 
  no kidding . 
  your point ? 
  its not really a secret given my flair . 
  do you really live in serbia ? 
  i was talking about as a hate group in general . 
  they may not be as big as islamic terrorists in the region but still exist anyway . 
  also the article says this in bosnia ... 
   because i feel like we ** central ** europeans ( austrians , czechs , slovaks , poles , hungarians , slovenes , ** croats ** , romanians ) you hungarians are quite alright . 
  union is probably out the question . 
  but a multi nation alliance perhaps ? 
   cristian, 
  [ what a relief this will be for birds . 
  ] ( http://thumb101.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/927436/102563453/stock-photo-a-blue-bird-bluebert-with-the-flag-of-europe-102563453.jpg ), 
  that 's what he meant by diaspora . 
  you are of bosnian or croatian descent no ? 
   i sincerely do n't know what this guys is talking about . 
  i think he means , neonazis , skin heads . 
  they exists in almost every country . 
  right wing nationalists to the extreme . 
  and how typical , you are bringing croats into the conversation yet the topic is not about croatia and the commentor is not croatian . 
  ca n't help it can you ? 
  i have seen quite a lot of `` but dem croats are the baddies '' when serbian crimes are talked about as well . 
  far more often in fact . 
  ** i can find you pages of this ** recent to . 
  it 's called whataboutism . 
  to deflect being in the hot seat , so to speak . 
  take the recent posts about sebrenica here for example . 
  most of the thread is people of a certain flair , talking about bosnian or croatian crimes instead of the topic at hand . 
  i 've lost count of the ustase responses i 've witnessed when croatia was n't even part of the conversation !, 
  really wish you would n't look at this one side ... then again , you hours new account with posts like this looks suspect . 
  downvote trains a commin !, 
  noticed as well . 
  though it s not average serbians , it 's nationalists doing this . 
  check the guy your comment just replied to 's history ( niko ) . 
  prime example of red flag . 
  funny he is one to talk . 
  actually not really . 
  looking at this thread . 
  serbian commentors are being upvoted quite high . 
  why is it ruined ? 
   unless you 're from switzerland , uk , russia or serbia ( list might be incomplete ) why was serbia left out ? 
  do they not feel european ? 
  indeed, 
  was expecting an anti-russian propogandathon . 
  but instead pleasently surprisef . 
  manages to maintane a fairly factual report . 
  people always want to be part of something bigger . 
  hey man , i 'm eastern european , i 'm more badass nah man , i 'm central european , i 'm more organized and efficient hah man , i 'm southern european , i 'm more chill than both you combines lol man , i 'm norther european , i 'm more abba than you lmao man , i 'm western european , i 'm more civilized than all of you simply bragging rights i would guess . 
  muh corporate domination . 
  sadly yes . 
  could you link to it ? 
  all i found so far was that there was a push to weaken kosovo 's autonomy in yugoslavia so as to keep it under serbia 's jurisdiction . 
  then things went downhill quite fast . 
  as for it having legal right to be a seperate nation , i found nothing for or against it . 
  i see . 
  i know that according to the yugoslav constituion , states within could vote to gain independence . 
  as for autonomous provinces i 'm unsure . 
  did n't provinces have right to secede to ? 
  for example wound ' t have vojvodina been able to leave legally ? 
   yep . 
  you 're checking all the boxes for `` idiot shill '' thus far . 
  keep going . 
  but of course i am one ...  i am happy to help with any prospective reading comprehension issues you might have . 
  i was talking about the article you linked . 
  perhaps you could use some literary help ? 
  you just claimed it was n't liberation and just linked to a paragraph that does n't support your claim . 
   i am happy to help with any prospective reading comprehension issues you might have . 
  you basically stated that war crimes against german civilians ( whatever they may have been , i am making no statement regarding their occurrence either way ) were irrelevant in the grand background of liberating europe from nazi hands , ie , that such events did not in any way detract from the `` liberation '' . 
  clear , now ? 
  so you agree then , croatia was liberated .
