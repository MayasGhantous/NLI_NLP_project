  german civilians fled when allied forces defeated nazi forces , just as serb civilians fled as croatian forces defeated jna and serbian rebel forces . 
  it created a refuge crisis , but you ca n't say that the other side did it intentionally or that that was the purpose and not a liberation move . 
   i dare you to post a series of comments of my comment history that prove any anti-croat/pro-serbian sentiment . 
  you just started and that is what can be detracted from it . 
  _ `` nah , everybody knows that the yugoslav wars were started by those baby-eating , shower-avoiding russian lapdog serbs . '', 
  the old victim card . 
  _ `` is there a new meaning to the word ` liberation ' '' this comment i replied to , implying that croats have no right to celebrate their liberation from serbian control in eastern croatia . 
  not a nice pattern we are seeing . 
  yet no criticism of serbia 's role in the war . 
  you just started , but your start seems one sided , is what i mean . 
  edit : grammar, 
  kosovo was a state within yugoslavia as apposes to rs though correct ? 
  considering states within yugoslavia had right to succeed . 
  not saying i support either just that perhaps that 's why they got independence . 
  it 's not the right kind of democracy that the us would like . 
   nationalist is another word for arsewipe , where he/she hails from . 
  agreed . 
  though i usually say `` asswipe '' , but `` arsewipe '' has a more sophisticated tint to it . 
   hat extreme victimization . 
  even though all that is seen on this subreddit is serbs demonizing the west while serbs are barely talked about . 
  got ta stay relevant though . 
  dat extreme victimization tho . 
   baby-eating , shower-avoiding first time i ever heard that . 
  one might think you made that up . 
  funny considering nationalists serbians are making a career out of demonizing their neighboring countries . . 
  but who cares when feeling sorry for yourself feels so damn good right ? 
  ah , the good old `` oblivious '' argument . 
  love it . 
  you link an article that proved my point . 
  then reply with a half-assed comment to feel somewhat intellectual . 
  what `` ends '' are you talking about . 
  are you making the ignorant assumption that war crimes is what won the war ? 
  a liberation happened . 
  a people were occupied , and agressive forces pushed out . 
  that is a libetation . 
  whether isolated war crimes occured or not . 
  perhaps read thw wiki article you linked . 
  guess there is no such thing as liberation then . 
  i 'll let the historians know . 
  its abviouse you have an anti-croat , pro-serbian victimization agenda . 
  you make it painfully obviouse in your comment history . 
  bet it pisses you off you can go and rewrite history to your liking , hehe . 
  why do bankers want to make more money ? 
  because they can . 
  history shows that warning a country is a very reliable method . 
  because clearly that was all it was . 
  war crime marathon ... no other purpose ... you even read what you linked ? 
  by that logic , liberating eastern nations of nazis was not liberation because war crimes against german civilians were committed . 
  just saying . 
  third vatican . 
  i believe second vatican title is held by poland . 
  i figured with the way things were going , the perception would be lower . 
  usa is index 74 , but i feel it should be lower . 
  you 've been to amercia ? 
  what did you like your stay ? 
  wonder what julia gorin will have to say about this . 
  [ here is is one of her works for those not familiar with her `` literature '' . 
  claiming sebrenica was an inside job . 
  ] ( http://www.juliagorin.com/wordpress/?p=2664 ) [ also a video where she speaks the `` truth '' about croats killing american and serbs doing nothing wrong . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmpvgbag6gm ), 
  something tells me you would love this woman 's work ... http://www.juliagorin.com/wordpress/?p=2664,

  are they a popular group in finland ? 
  is there a link for that ? 
  what the hell does he base that on ? 
  is finns party right-wing ? 
  edit : christ , sorry i do n't know the parties present in every nation of the world ... 
   nor did they exist before the war unlike the usta\u0161e . 
  i agree . 
  but actually they were n't in power either until hitler placed pavelic in power and kicked out the croatian peasant party . 
  beforehand , they were a rogue outcast terrorist group . 
  they were a puppet state that had to answer to hitler . 
  they were forced to fight in the eastern front . 
  had to allow germany to have direct control of their economy and jurisdiction of certain territories in the ndh . 
  there was an example when pavelic allowed jews to join his army . 
  hitler was furious . 
  had him stop . 
  croatian society was divided between supporting them , supporting partisans or neither . 
  pavelic 's sadist regime and nazi aggression is what drove the foundation of the partisans . 
  i 'm not familiar with the vichy , could you link to them ? 
  also were you saying the vichy were worse ? 
   even the nazi 's thought they were savages . 
  ehh . 
  the nazi 's were upset because they thought there would be a rebellion on there hands not out of moral concern . 
  they could n't care less for civilians . 
  [ `` the racial policies of the ndh greatly contributed to their rapid loss of control over the occupied territory , as they fed the ranks of both the chetniks and partisans and caused even the german authorities to attempt to restrain paveli\u0107 and his genocidal campaign . '', 
  `` the paveli\u0107 regime was the most murderous in europe after hitler 's germany '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ante_paveli%c4%87 ), 
  lead by example . 
  be the better man , so to speak . 
  well , it 's not right to kill civilians for wanting to stay home . 
  though i was not aware maldic gave them a choice . 
  but still , it was a threat . 
  if only the un officers were able to find a better ultimatum . 
  so mladic gave them an ultimatum , leave or face the consequences ? 
   handful of serbs only a handful ? 
  why ? 
  at least be considerate and [ hand him some of this ] ( http://173.201.204.62/item-library/images/m/m4038.jpg ) before . 
  he dreams of electric sheep ^ ( made in china ) . 
   clinton if anyone touches them , that person will get disappeared .
