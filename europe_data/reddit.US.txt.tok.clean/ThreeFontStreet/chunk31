  then again this is probably your `` venting '' account . 
   your just a homofascist you and / u/yolo _ swagovic2 were meant for each other . . 
  `` butthurt '' about what ? 
  serbian diaspora making croat nazi jokes ? 
  what are you , 12 like your buddy / u/bahatost ? 
   yes , croatia did n't do nothing wrong . 
   did n't do nothing soooo , they did do something wrong ? 
  double negative . 
  also what is your deal ? 
  i read somewhere that nations/regions that use latin are `` less evolved '' than those who use cyrillic based . 
  laughable i know , but there are people who think this . 
  nicely made . 
  send your water polo team as naval blockade . 
  as a usa american i call upon my right to plead fifth . 
  serbia is almost twice the size of us . 
   no country is held responsible for it it seems the country reaponsible for it no longer exists . 
  and when it did , not many recognized its existance . 
  though there is a memeorial and recognition from the president of croatia . 
   genocide convention so not even germany is entered ? 
   jasenovac are not recognized as one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_genocides_by_death_toll it is listed though . 
  how is it not recognized ? 
  not outright murder no . 
  but i have come across comments justifying war crimes or revenge against croats and bosnians and serbs . 
  even outright denial of history . 
  i believe the image was called `` pounding cheese '', 
   klix.ba eh sites like b92 and balkaninsight have some great creativity there too . 
  not much one can do about it . 
   to pop the eyes , chop heads and rape serbian babies but then do n't expect for usa to save you what was that all about ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  are you saying the sebrenica massacre did n't happen ? 
   history is written by the victors , sadly . 
  should we question the holocaust as well ? 
   2 day old account ight, 
  the golf cart with the security crammed in it , hilarious . 
  but obama walking ? 
  worst american president ever . 
   do n't tell serbs , croats are nicer and friendlier than them . 
  you will be arkaned . 
   do n't tell them that ~ ~ herzegovina ~ ~ bosnia is historically croat rather then bosniak . 
  unless you are suicidal . 
  shhh , let us pretend those do n't exist , and savor this one . 
  my point is that the analogy does n't really work . 
  they could learn a thing or two about tolerance from the serbs . 
  ** / s ** oh the irony . 
  honestly , how is an article slandering an entire ethnic group published on a news site like b92 ? 
  i mean what could ukraine be so busy with as to neglect its duties ? 
  surprised to see croatia in 2nd . 
   should croats erect a statue of paveli\u0107 ? 
  are you comparing princip to pavelic ? 
   the serbs have every right to erect a statue of him i agree  from their perspective , he 's not a bad guy . 
  well that part is debatable . 
  bin-laden was a hero to someone . 
  hitler was a hero to someone . 
  karadzic was a hero to some . 
  but princip , i think , can be seen as a legitimate freedom fighter . 
  he was n't a war mongerer . 
  not that i condone violence , but in his case , there was little option . 
   would you assassinate adolf hitler if you could ? 
  are we labeling ferdinand as genocidal maniac ? 
  oh come off it . 
  it 's not like there was a statue of [ mihailovi\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dra%c5%bea_mihailovi%c4%87 ) or [ nedi\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milan_nedi%c4%87 ) erected there . 
  i think serbia is well within the right to erect a statue of princip . 
  also pinning the cause for wwi on one person is wayyy oversimplified and just makes for a more interesting title . 
  brilliant analogy actually . 
   i 'm just saying it 'd be nice to hear we were n't the only guys doing bad stuff during the war . 
  who said you were ? 
  i have yet to see a comment saying there were only crimes committed by the serbian side . 
  usually people refer to all ex-yugos as `` liking their ethnic cleansing '' . 
  there is a larger shift on serbs as the `` bigger bad guy '' i think because there were larger and more war crimes committed in the serbian name . 
  but i do n't think anyone thinks it was only the serbs . . 
  you are right . 
  the people there are perpetuating this . 
  edit : sarcasm, 
  there was another person on talking about his/her family being victim to croatian aggression . 
  yet that one was upvoted with not complaining comments ... 
  calling it playing the victim card comes off harsh and brutish . 
  but i agree , he took the above comment to seriously . 
  yeah , crnaruka should spend his time doing more productive things . 
  i see . 
  thanks for the replies . 
  how does most of croatia see tudjman ? 
  also what is the majority opinion in croatia about war crimes commited by its forces ( not op storm but in heneral ) , is it typically acknowledged ? 
  it seems though that croatian suspected war criminals are poorley prosecuted where as serbian ones are almost always perminantly convicted , if my observation is correct . 
  you think the courts have bias on behalf of croats ? 
  how the hell did marka\u010d get an appeal and his sentence removed completely ? 
  you think tudjman would have been convicted had he not died ? 
  it is . 
  montenegro is ight, 
  what do you think of gotovina then ? 
  he was sent to court was he not ? 
  what you and your family went through is fucked up . 
  where is your family from by the way ? 
  but it is n't only one user who is like this . 
  almost any balkan news site i visit pertaining to croatia/serbia/bosnia or war crimes is riddle with pro-karadzic , pro-chetnik , pro-genocidal redirect . 
  but i doubt that all of serbia thinks this way same it 's doubtful all croats do . 
  how you decided all of croatia celebrates ethnic cleansing , i do n't see . 
  courts found no evidence incriminating gotovina . 
  tudjman was a scumbag though who might have . 
  just that i 've seen your posts on here . 
  you come across as someone who would definitely respond in distaste to a comment that is anti-serbian .
