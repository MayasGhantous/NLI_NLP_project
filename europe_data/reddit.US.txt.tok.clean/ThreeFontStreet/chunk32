  let alone that person become mod . 
  and why not ? 
  slovenia and hungary . 
  the more decent neighbors . 
   i most likely would n't care enough to comment , but if asked i would support him sorry , that is bullshit . 
  especially coming from you ... 
  the cleansing of the mods . 
  he said hungarians not kingdom though . 
  yes i 'm sure they all contributed their fair share , to certain extents . 
  croats helped a tad bit  ** siege of szigetv\u00e1r ** `` the battle that saved civilization '' [ zrinski 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_szigetv%c3%a1r#/media/file:oton_ivekovic,_nikola_subic_zrinski.jpg ) gunpowder booby-trap killed 3,000 alone .

   other examples were the medieval king of the croats you mean king tomislav of croatia ? 
  a preview of what 's to come in this subreddit . 
  he has , he even talked about family members killed by ustase . 
  it means friendship and love . 
   / u/crnaruka and what gave you the confidence about this particular one ? 
  i. ... i think i need to go lay down for a bit . . 
  gymnop\u00e9die no . 
  1 , is actually favorite pf mine !, 
  ** debussy ** : [ clair de lune ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zisqpdc9yny ) is also quite calming . 
  [ i cry evrytim ] ( http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view7/2429891/wipes-tear-o.gif ), 
  only hungary has these ? 
  do n't think so mate . 
  you do n't think posts from a few idiots defines the relation between poles and germans do you ? 
   balkanic that term itself sounds eruptive, 
  that city being vukovar ... 
  way to post a picture without any context of what is going on . 
  only prooves sielgaudys point . 
  edit : one from years ago at that . 
  that bear is adorable , but do n't get to close ... 
  i mean come on . 
  a troll masquerading as a serb , trying to incite hostility between croats and serbs for the sake of entertainment sounds quite plausible . 
   declaration independence and not get any push-back from us . 
  you talking about the moldovan push for independence ? 
  some serbian commentor outed crni when he found he accidentally posted a comment with his alternate account . 
  his other account is quantumconfinement . 
  i quite like this one , sad but uplifting wartime tune . 
  [ zlatni dukati - ne dirajte mi ravnicu ( do n't touch my land [ for i will return ] ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4dkyvbcfm ) originally by [ miroslav \u0160koro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk8qzothdjg ) the cover for this is also pretty good . 
  thats just the clone 's resin drying up . 
  usualy it takes 14 days to solidify , but they had to rush it . 
  [ them missiles be rockin ' , brah ] ( https://graneyandthepig.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/tonyhawk.jpg ), 
  ah , i assumed votapman and crnaruka were the same since they were both initial moderators of [ r/srpska ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/srpska ) . 
  had never crossed my mind crni would be romania , lol . 
  though i knew he was full of shit . 
  [ please keep up the good investigative work . 
  ] ( http://reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/upvote_christian_bale.gif ) edit : why a romania would make it his/her mission to great lengths to increase tensions between serbs and croats is the mystery . 
  you forgot , 10 day old / u/samoserem , his name meaning `` just speaking nonsense '' either from rs or serb from abroad ( uses cyrillic ) . 
  would have never guessed / u/crnaruka was a romanian , haha . 
  how did you figure that ? 
  do n't forget / u/votapman , crnaruka 's alter ego . 
  [ cheer up !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0nkedcnjym ), 
  sadly most think , slavs + communism = ussr, 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  i 'm not going to blindly defend the actions of a country just because they may be allies with mine . 
  such hive mind thinking leads only to more problems . 
  he/she seems to prefer the victim trope rather than explain . 
  [ shit ] ( http://media.worldbulletin.net/news/2015/09/18/zoran-milanovic.jpg ), 
  is it confirmed he went through greece then croatia ? 
  i thought the quote about `` cleaning the backyard '' that in context i figured she meant suspected war criminals . 
  she said most not all so i thought she assumed most were war criminals . 
  which is stupid since how would she even know . 
  but i know she is anti-serb in general . 
  if she actualy is hating on serbs for being serbs as apposed to going after specific suspected untrialed war criminals , than she is more evil than i thought . 
  im amazed she would so openly say such a thing . 
  she should face fines or more for hate speach . 
  especialy while being a public servant !, 
  though still inserbia news article did not even comment on linta 's comparison of tudjman to pavelic as same , wich is a stupid comparison . 
  not surpised it coming from litna . 
  so my distrust of that website still stands . 
  rather trust b92 . 
  totally , desert storm was the only time !, 
  just once !, 
   tomasic said two days ago in vukovar : `` they ( serbia 's officials ) should pray to god that we do n't start cleaning our yard , they will have many serbs from croatia who will have to go to serbia . 
  they see this country as an atm and a self-service and they give nothing back . '', 
  that statement was triggered by a statement from serbian labour minister aleksandar vulin who said croatia should not lecture serbia , rather it should look into its own yard and prosecute war crimes . 
  looks to me her statement was n't pro ustase but a response that those who have evaded criminal courts over vukovar war crimes , will be sought after as apposed to your linked news site claiming all serbs are to be deported . 
  hence why she said many . 
  though here implication that many are war criminals is itself offensive . 
  inserbia is notorious for skewing news . 
  no wonder they list the quote out of context . 
  i think she is an awful person from other events involving her . 
  but this quote i 'm not sure . 
  though us 's western allies do contribute . 
  man power , supplies , etc. . . 
  cartoon news network, 
  really warming to read this . 
  why is this getting so many downvotes ? 
  no matter your ethnicity , this looks great . 
  i think he is arguing the types of countries , not how well they are known . 
  where is the list of countries and their votes ? 
  link ? 
  weird . 
  he was n't moderator couple weeks ago . 
  i am honestly considering unsubscribing from this subreddit if that is the standard here . 
  seems a lot agree with him ... glad he lost moderator status while back . 
  if this is his mentality . 
   `` i do n't wan na waste my vote/who the hell are they '' thing . 
  in america , same thing . 
  it 's like choosing to go with big name brands as apposed to indie brands in a store .
