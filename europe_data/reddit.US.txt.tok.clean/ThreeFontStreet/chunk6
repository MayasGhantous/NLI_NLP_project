  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omarska_camp https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uzamnica_camp https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vilina_vlas croats and serbs have a resume of concentration camps, 
  they are taking moral high ground about ww2 ? 
  edit : as for punishemnt of ndh colaborators https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_axis_personnel_indicted_for_war_crimes https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bleiburg_repatriations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbara_pit what other punishment are you talking about ? 
  [ is n't he always ? 
  and croatia could use the business i 'd imagine . 
   maybe . 
  and maybe we were prepared to take 2-4000 people per day that travel the balkan route , but not extra 10 000 that got stuck at hungarian border and all showed up at our doorstep at once . 
  this is what people should understand . 
  the rate at which people were entering . 
  when hungary shut is serbian border , serbian officials redirected refugees to croatian border causing a huge influx . 
  huge influx that is not able to swiftly pass through croatia like it was hungary and serbia . 
  looks like some sourpuss reported . 
  hah , yep . 
  i 'm dying of laughter . 
  poland what is with the rooster and the russian flag ? 
  perhaps they will fizzle out , and the more conservative of the democratic party will split off leaving us with a more moderate conservative party . 
  natural selection at work . 
  no coaster ? 
  impeach now . 
  croatistan, 
   s does n't exactly give handouts/benefits oh that will change . 
  starting with mass amnesty to probably begin . 
  if democrats get their way . 
  and if republicans get things their way , just as scary . 
   croatia , serbia and hungary playing a game of hot potato https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbwqchb95rg, 
  something something ... some damn fool in the balkans ... something something . 
  `` we are the eagle '' - zoran milanovic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pedqb2398z4, 
  i 'm surprised it was n't a floridian man ( florida man [ insert illegal act here ] ) . 
   answering to a question about croatia 's unilateral closing of the border between the two countries , serbian minister of social policy talks about the possibility of suing them at international courts wut ? 
   asked to comment on the threats coming from serbia , croatian prime minister said `` an eagle does n't catch flies . 
  we are the eagle . '', 
  even bigger wut ? 
   and us border control is waiting for illegal mexicans with cookies and milk ? 
  pretty much what obama wants . 
  hungary pleez give back choo choo . 
  without the refugees on board of course . 
  they were n't . 
  current news said they were sent back to croatia , ~ ~ disarmed ~ ~ not disarmed . 
   all 3 countries are just transit countries . 
  for now . 
  take photos of scenery , make them into postcards , posters etc. 
  no problem . 
  yeah , `` coming to terms means '' to accept something as fact as in croats to accept their real serbian identity . 
  which i am joking of course . 
  not that there is anything wrong with being serbian . 
  but if croat = serb ^ catholic and serb = turk ^ orthodox then does n't that make croat = ( turk ^ orthodox ) ^ catholic = turk ? 
  of course the migrants were calm . 
  they were n't stuck in serbia . 
  they were on their way to germany . 
  in croatia they are stuck . 
  vucic better be careful with being so smug as he will have egg on his face once serbia becomes the last stop . 
  milanovic was smug and look at him now , hah . 
   there 's two mentioned approach on the same subject here : huh ? 
  i was just kidding , i do n't think croats are actually catholic serbs ... 
  one day croats will come to terms with this . 
  no surprise . 
  despite serbs also being of iranian origin , they refused to settle in serbia . 
  might be be because they are arabic and iranians are persian ? 
  hehe, 
  new slogan : `` kosovo is syria '', 
  oi mate , not with that attitude you wo n't be . 
  hah , sure buddy, 
   typical xenophobic eastern scum wow, 
  so when will we find out who is better endowed ? 
  so poles are stereotypicly unwestern and nationalistic ? 
  ah , i was only considered those killed in the camps , forgot to include those killed on spot as well . 
  only furthers how.sgupid that guy 's comparison is . 
  how the hell can you blanket all poles under one action ? 
  so there were some idiot fans boycotting . 
  does n't mean all poles think like this and it deffinitley does n't mean they arent western . 
  besides , boycotting a games is farrrrrr less intense than slaugtering over ~ ~ 3 ~ ~ 6 million people . 
  edit : fixed factual error, 
  oh there are others . 
  i posted a thread about croarian locals warning refugees with maps . 
  some guy commented that those guys are betraying their country for giving them the info . 
  i thought it was dark humour . 
  nope he was for real . 
  first greece debt crisis , now refugee crisis . 
  eu solidarity not holding so well . 
  it is ultimatley germany to blame since all the refugees are saying is that is their final destination and all other nations are to shitty for their taste . 
  i was mainly off put by his accusation croats are always shit talkking serbs yet look at him in his comment comparing who took in more refugees . 
  now croats have to close the borders since the refugees are gatheeing and gather with no place to go . 
  it seems milanovic as you said thought he could pass them to you and hungary , but that plan failed . 
  please i tend to be quite critical of croatia and its gov. 
  well than smaller nation with a dysfunctional government . 
  huh , always thought serbia had a higher gdp . 
  or perhaps take in refugees ourselves being that it is a teeny weeny bit our fault they are running to begin with . 
  something something , we fucked up big in middle east something something . 
   ile you hold croatia on a pedestal for being very neighborly . 
  thanks for coloring my words . 
  where did i hold them on a pedastil for being neighborly ? 
  did i say they are handling the situation well ? 
  or are you just using me as an excuse to vent about them ? 
  tell me , how is neigborly slovenia dealing with the situation ? 
  taking in all the refugees ? 
  passing them along ? 
  or clos sing the borders like the croats are doing . 
  these are 10,000 furiose refugees who now found out they cant move through croatia lile they did through serbia since hungary nor slovenia will let them pass . 
  and it seems the croatian government is too dysfunctional to take on more than 10,000 .
