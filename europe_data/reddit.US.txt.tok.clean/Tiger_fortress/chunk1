your defeatism is n't helping the situation . 
  this is not a meteor the size of the moon heading towards earth . 
  this is a completely solveable and preventable problem . 
  i 'm afraid not . 
  i 'm pretty new to the podcast scene myself . 
  i 've heard good things about [ dan carlin 's hardcore history ] ( http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/ ) though . 
  some of it is behind a paywall , but there 's still some free content in there . 
  yeah i found the site a few days back . 
  they have some great podcasts , as long as you have the time to listen to them . 
  if you guys want a perspective on what the orthodox church had to deal with under ottomon/muslim rule , i 'd encourage you to [ listen to this ] ( http://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/hopko/church_and_state_part_4 ) . 
  it 's about 40min long , but it might help you understand why many orthodox christians are wary of this situation . 
  do it , and then show us all how to do it sweden . 
  we need to bring aurum back , it 's such a beautiful word . 
  i have no idea why major companies still do this . 
  you just ca n't get away with this kind of thing anymore . 
  information gets out too easily . 
  i think the best thing europe could do would be to start deporting people . 
  then once they get back to their homes and spread the word about how europe is n't some kind of land of milk and honey , but instead full of bureaucracy and questionable food , they 'll stop coming . 
  or at least see a reduction . 
  joking aside , what 's going to happen when winter comes ? 
  besides the reduction in sunlight , how much snow do you guys get ? 
  does it shut down the roads ? 
  because no one in power says `` no ! '', 
  so jealous you guys get multiple parties . 
  yeah i know most of them are crackpots , but still . 
  everyone gets their passport stamped there . 
  but only once . 
  with mustache ? 
  mexican . 
  no mustache ? 
  teenager . 
  you 've crossed a huge threshold when you can disrespect law enforcement like that and be rewarded with what you want . 
  how long have most somalians been in the netherlands ? 
  are they recent arrivals ? 
   dumpster fire oh god i 've read it like 5 times and i still ca n't stop laughing . 
  what an insult !, 
  60 % has got to be some kind of mistake . 
  please tell me that 's some kind of mistake . 
  uncle sam slipping to 5th place ? 
  this can not stand . 
  and what the hell does switzerland have to innovate ? 
  compound interest ? 
  chocolate ? 
  compound chocolate ? 
  oh i think any time you get large amounts of alcohol plus men and women together , there will be issues . 
  but surely you agree this is an extra hazerdous situation ? 
  i really hope there 's good communication between american and russian forces , we do n't want a chinese embassy incident like what happened in the kosovo conflict . 
  [ we came pretty close to an incident last time , let 's not do it again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incident_at_pristina_airport#cite_note-bbc_2000-5 ), 
  `` there are reports that refugee centers in the uk are serving haggis . 
  in unrelated news , downing street faces new charges of crimes against humanity . '', 
  a whole lot of drunk young women in clothes that can not be described as modest , and a whole lot of young men from countries with very strict sexual values who probably have n't had a whole lot of `` release '' on their journey to europe . 
  i really hope this does n't go where i think it will . 
  [ i urge caution when dealing with ukranians ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzltf_pxbyw ), 
  lol , balkanks being forced to play hot potato with these migrants . 
  he who closes his borders last loses !, 
  so how bad does it have to get for a german cop to be allowed to use a firearm ? 
  am i witnessing the slow death of multiculturalism ? 
  i do n't want to get my hopes up . 
  [ this is for you romania ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09qnrfzy-k ), 
  ** over my dead body **, 
  this is pm hollande right ? 
  i have to say i 'm surprised he did n't throw in with merkel and put up the welcome sign . 
  your socialists must be different or something else must be going on . 
  we need more french posters to tell us what 's going on . 
  i 'm curious , do any greeks go to germany or other countries to find work ? 
  i hope eastern europe pulls through . 
  i 'm really proud of them for standing up for themselves in the face of all this condemnation and threats from the smug westerners . 
  so that 's where winnie the pooh has been all these years . 
  baby steps !, 
  baby steps !, 
  one upside to this whole fiasco ? 
  my knoweldge of south and eastern europe is improving . 
  poor romania , even afghans laugh at them . 
  i 'm surprised she is n't being asked to resign . 
  am i reading this right ? 
  ** 15-20 % ** are illiterate ? 
  where does someone like that fit in a post industrial economy ? 
  hell can you even manage a bank account being illiterate ? 
  nothing but love for you bulgbro . 
  stay safe . 
  bulgarian joke i heard a while back `` every country has its own mafia , but bulgaria is the only place where the mafia has a country '' . 
  just saw the graph . 
  only 20 % ? 
  the way i was hearing the media talk about them , it sounded like they were headed for a clean sweep . 
  amazing that it still stands . 
  yes , i remember reading an article a while back that said the chinese government gives tax breaks and other incentives to han chinese to move to tibet . 
  no tibetans , no problems !, 
  i hope the police or federal investigators go after any crooked cops or politicians who accept bribes from these smugglers . 
  that 's quite the journey . 
  assuming the statement about bin laden is not taken out of context , wo n't that have a negative effect ? 
  i take it this does n't include the relatives these people will send for once they get settled in ? 
  1 million people , most of whom probably still have two parents , maybe some siblings , maybe some children ... 
  no dinner first ? 
  do n't worry , once uncle sam exhausts all other solutions , we always do the right one . 
   it 's really very simple , mr. sanandaji explained . 
  * you ca n't combine open borders with a welfare state * . 
  milton friedman said this almost 40 years ago . 
  those buildings look comfy . 
  absolutely beautiful !, 
  thank you for sharing !,
