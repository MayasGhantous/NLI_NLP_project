  let 's give him a * hand * , guys !, 
  instead of cement , did they use chewed bubblegum ? 
  foreshadowing ? 
  stockholm syndrome , if it 's even true at all . 
  ** eu : ** `` please do n't leave me ! ... 
  * quick hans , publish that fake poll that says people still like us * '', 
  wait , norway captured crimea ? 
  i ca n't keep up with the ukrainian conflict anymore . 
  back to video games i go then !, 
  `` by george !, 
  that winged beast is horrendous ! '', 
  i know , it happened so fast . 
  the embassies tend to strengthen their security when they 're in a muslim majority country . 
  so are you saying ... we 're both being misleading ? 
  well of course he has to greet his slave master first, 
  [ this says otherwise ] ( https://i.redd.it/t57reggqlozy.jpg ), 
  [ which one is real ?!, 
  i love how the top comment is a gif , debunking the post and this shit * still * gets upvoted . 
  you motherfuckers are so desperate lol, 
  true . 
  i was making fun of how we americans claim heritage . 
  we typically only go as far back as when our family came to the states . 
  my mom 's family came from devonshire/south wales and my dad 's side came from ... potato farm ... ireland . 
  before that ? 
  hell , i do n't know ... mongolia , maybe ? 
  i might be a hair color shade away from being a guard , but it would probably be the gas chamber for me . 
  ^ this guy loves oliver cromwell, 
  i have no idea what i am . 
  if you threw the eu in a blender , added some gunpowder and bbq sauce , then dumped it all in the toilet , you 'd get me . 
  hitler would n't know which camp to send me to . 
  non-orange sideways netball it 's a long name , but i think you 'll enjoy it eventually . 
  an an irish-american ( 1/34ths ) , we call it netball because fuck it i 'm irish now and you ca n't stop me . 
  looks photoshopped, 
  let 's go france !, 
  le pen is mightier than the sword !, 
  i wish my country was spelled grobbritannien :(, 
  there 's no ocean of dreams ... is there ? '', 
  i take back my `` nerd '' comments . 
  that looks awesome . 
  those warriors definitely study the blade . 
   ever seen a roman legion with a few minions ( those yellow things ) , backed by nazi fire support , charge a soviet apc surrounded by medieval knights with bren lmgs ? 
  no , but i definitely want to see that now . 
  `` lightning bolt !, 
  lightning bolt !, 
  off my lawn , nerds ! '', 
  i once got head in a construction site . 
  ... not as cool as in a castle though :(, 
  reeeeeee, 
  i thought father christmas died in a battle, 
  is that why they call it `` passover '' because santa passes over your house because you do n't give him cookies ? 
  how do you know ? 
  maybe he 's just avoiding * you * ... think about it , man . 
  heavy stuff , right ? 
  hey , what do you think you 're doing ? 
  get your ass back here , you 're ` murica grounded . 
  i 'm sorry , europeans . 
  this one decided to defect like a little bitch . 
  wait until poppa trump finds out about this . 
  great weather today , huh ? 
  i think it might rain tomorrow though . 
  i can practice . 
  heels to the floor . 
  that 's the proper way, 
  sounds amazing . 
  i swear , i must be slavic at heart, 
  i am really ze german citizen . 
  my flair is a lie . 
  hahaha got ta love polandball, 
  it 's similar to that , but piece that goes on the bread is a consistent thick slice of white . 
  almost like a cheese . 
  yep , i saw the wiki article on it and it looks like fatback . 
  oh wow , so it 's specifically cured fatback . 
  interesting ... thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  i might have to try it sometime . 
  * scrolls thread for the video * ... sigh , [ fine i guess i 'll be the one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2bfqdupl1i ) . 
  i 'll definitely keep an eye out for one . 
  my friend collects a lot of historical rifles from soviet/eastern bloc and has his c&r license , so he can get them shipped directly to his house . 
  he has cool stuff like an m39 finnish mosin and special , modded m44 rifles that the kgb supplied to other countries for guerilla warfare . 
  the history behind it all is fascinating to me . 
  i have a 1934 tula mosin and when i hold it , i wonder if it used to be in the hands of some solider fearing for his life as the germans advanced . 
   zastava m-48 ah , yes . 
  i like that too . 
  yeah , some laws are weird . 
  for example , canadians ca n't own aks , but they use czech vz-58s instead . 
  which i also want , 
  here 's a quick from worst to best when it comes to aks : * i.o. 
  $ 600 - $ 700 * century wasr-10 $ 750ish * zastava npap $ 680 - $ 700 * century ras47 $ 675 - $ 700 * ddi stamped $ 950 * century c39v2 $ 750 * cugir rh10 $ 800 * kit guns ( atlantic , james river , petronov , high standard , etc. ), 
  ~ $ 800 - $ 1000 * ddi milled $ 1075 * arsenal slr107 $ 1000 * arsenal slr104 $ 1000 - $ 1100 * definitive arms dakm-4150 $ 1100 - $ 1200 * arsenal sam7r $ 1300 * arsenal sam7sf $ 1400 * kreb 's ak-103ks $ 1700 * rifle dynamics $ 1800 - $ 2200 and izhmash ( or fully automatic ) rifles are * not * illegal to own here . 
  well , they 're known as izhmash . 
  and those rifles are equal quality to what i own . 
  so an izhmash, 
  there 's no such thing . 
  you mean a saiga ? 
  anything modern beats a kalashnikov . 
  yeah , it 's a little odd . 
  it 's certainly no mauser .
