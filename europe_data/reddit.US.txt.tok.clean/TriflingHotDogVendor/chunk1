send them to the us . 
  i 'm sure various nutcase militias in montana would love to buy all of it . 
  just in case those damn chinese invade . 
  some day the gods will bestow a chipotle upon you in the great north . 
  and you will rejoice . 
  i chose iceland , ireland , uk , denmark , netherlands , sweden , norway . 
  that 's it . 
  i 'm probably genetically unable to learn new languages , so we 'll stick to places where english is known by 99 % of the people . 
  please tell me there is video somewhere . 
  [ here 's a picture of them on the train before things went crazy . 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cnaw7wiuyaarkv_.jpg ), 
  brilliant disguise , though . 
  nobody thinks you are an american serviceman wearing that munich kit . 
  bbq and jazz are america 's gift to the world . 
  this guys have to be legit war veterans . 
  who the hell `` hears '' a guy loading an ak in the bathroom of a train ? 
  sometimes people like to claim victories against the us and will stretch the truth to claim it . 
  canadians claim they defeated the us in 1812 . 
  like it was a group of maple leaf flag waving cannucks defeating the modern us army . 
  in reality canada was n't even a country yet , the english military was incredibly powerful fighting against a weaker us force , the fighting in canada were between a bunch of ragtag militias fighting each other , and the canadian theater was just one theater in the larger war of 1812 . 
  bring up the battle of new orleans or the battle of baltimore and they do n't know wtf you are talking about . 
  `` hipster '' was actually something in the mid to late 00s . 
  it was a bizarre phenomenon that occured because urban white people in the us realized that their lives were vacuous . 
  so they started searching for `` authenticity '' and wound up fetishizing the past in weird ways . 
  some trust fund kids liked to dress like they were poor . 
  an odd time to be honest . 
  it then sort of petered out once the financial crisis hit . 
  it oddly lingers a decade after it started in the fashion world . 
  sunglasses are still too big and stupid looking . 
  people still think pbr is fantastic . 
  beards made a comeback in the mainstream . 
  i 'm sorry that its effects linger in europe . 
  and to remember which is which , ** w ** yoming is further ** w ** est. 
  the curse of being a short train ride away from nyc . 
  it 's just like the time i delivered food to charlie sheen 's house . 
  i expected more prostitutes . 
  sure there are like half a dozen , but i expected more . 
  how the hell are we all of a sudden becoming more liberal than europe ? 
  legal weed ... gays can mary...self-professed socialist bernie sanders going up the polls like he has a rocket up his ass . 
  strange times , friends . 
  they will be bailed out in one way or the the other . 
  every year the rich states like texas and california subsidize the poorer states like mississippi and west virginia to the tune of billions and billions . 
  its not even an issue to us . 
  if europeans want a single currency , they need to learn that the current setup is n't viable . 
  no , i did n't know that they could n't file chapter 9 like cities can . 
  i 'm not a bankruptcy lawyer . 
  was n't aware of that . 
  learning about ` murica on r/europe . 
  * crickets *, 
  maybe we should offer them statehood and just annex the entire country . 
  who in greece wants to be an american ? 
  you are n't allowed to like soccer anymore , though . 
  you get to be much fatter without feeling bad about it , though , so there is that . 
  europeans do understand that this is completely different , right ? 
  pr going bankrupt wo n't cause them to start issuing their own currency that will guarantee hyperinflation and potentially decades of misery . 
  the poor people of pr will still receive federal aid in healthcare ( medicaid ) and food ( food stamps ) . 
  its not like it has n't happened before . 
  not at the state ( or territory in this case ) level , but detroit went bankrupt in 2013 . 
  its roughly the same degree of crisis . 
  they simply filed chapter 9 bankruptcy and are restructuring their finances . 
  ~ ~ which is probably what pr will do . ~ ~ ok , apparently they ca n't . 
  but it still does n't change the fact that the two instances are n't comparable . 
  they were shitty polls ? 
  so no europe ... no argentina ... no brazil ? 
  yanks vs el tri for the cup , i guess ? 
  cool . 
  finally going to win that damned thing . 
  $ 120 gets me and the wife 1000 minutes of talk and unlimited everything else with no caps or throttling on sprint . 
  during `` march madness , '' i streamed about 60gb of data over 2 weeks .

  every time i see that name ... god damn wondolowski . 
  you were 5 yards from the goal . 
  grrr . 
  pfft , like we ever get whatever 's permission to bomb the whoever . 
  70 years later and people still have pissing matches over the worst event in human history . 
  of which very , very few , if any , people on reddit had a role in . 
  it 's not coincidental . 
  of course , in the us , poor = fat , oddly . 
  probably the first time in human history . 
  but that 's the story on why those states die early . 
  now go find an obesity rate map and match it up with the us life expectancy map . 
  so do people without children get to take time time off , too ? 
  do n't want to contribute to discrimination . 
  what day is feudalism day ? 
  well have a kick ass renaissance fair with authentic lords and ladies . 
  you are probably underestimating it at that . 
  just sitting around , your average 20 something burns over 2000 calories . 
  if they are very active , it 's probably closer to 3000 calories . 
  this guy really underestimates american apathy . 
  as long as americans do n't come home in coffins , they will more or less ignore how much the military spends . 
  if we even barely cared , there would be riots in the streets already . 
  $ 700 billion is just a number to most of us . 
  that 's a lot of healthcare and education right there . 
  but , again , apathy is a powerful force . 
  sad , but true . 
  i 'd love to go to berlin , but they do n't pay the peons enough in the us so that they can afford it . 
  who needs to see the world when we have crippling student debt and healthcare to pay for ?
