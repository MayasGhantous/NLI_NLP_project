  well , you commented on the fact that this graph is proof that the dark ages exist , particularly that the population was lower during the dark ages . 
  the end of that low population period did not coincide with the end of the dark ages , however . 
  alright then , you 're right . 
  periods do not have clearly defined starting and ending points . 
  however , the latest i 've even heard an ending point for the term `` dark ages '' is 1500 . 
  the population uptick occurred in 1900 . 
  while i understand that effects are n't immediate , do n't you think 400 years is a little ridiculous ... ? 
  copying the same response again is n't furthering your point . 
  my point was that the population did n't begin to rise again substantially until 1900 . 
  i do n't think anyone in their right mind would claim that this uptick occurred due to the end of the dark ages , which in widest reasonable definition * ended 400 years earlier . 
  * the end of the middle ages ( ~ 1500 ) . 
  most uses today are more restricted , ending in ~ 1000 . 
  i wonder if the risorgimento had anything to do with it , or if it 's just a coincidence that unification occurred right before the population spike ( which was caused by other things ) . 
  yeah , the dark ages that ended in * 1900 * ? 
  not if you use the anti-meridian . 
  good , although the coloring is very biased . 
  this is n't a concession by the way , i 'm just kinda over arguing at this point, 
  well , let 's just agree to disagree then . 
  well , in this scenario , he 's asking for what the word means , not what the physical location is . 
  `` what does england mean ? '', 
  vs `` what is england ? '', 
  `` england '' still means `` land of the angles . '', 
  sure , i do n't think of it whenever anybody mentions england , but if someone were to ask me `` what does england mean ? '', 
  that would be my response . 
  no , i 'm saying it means `` east . '', 
  not in current german , of course , but it does mean `` east . '', 
  just because a language - old high german - is n't spoken anymore does n't mean it does n't give meaning to words . 
  that 's a very interesting view on language that i ca n't say i agree with , but at least you 're consistent . 
  you 're arguing that the name no longer means anything because the language it came from changed ? 
  so does england ( angle-land ) no longer mean `` land of the angles ? '', 
  does frankreich no longer mean `` realm of the franks ? '', 
  and ... yeah , you 're pretty spot on with the netherlands . 
  well , at least `` land of the franks '' refers to a specific people . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%c3%96sterreich `` from old high german ostarr\u00eechi ( attested since 996 ) ; a compound of an element meaning `` east '' ( cognate to modern german ost ( `` east '' ) ) and r\u012bhhi ( `` realm '' ) ( modern german reich ( `` realm '' ) ) . '', 
  \u00d6sterreich does , in fact , mean eastern realm . 
  what point are you trying to repeat ? 
  my original post just explained the etymology of austria and why it 's misleading because the accidental use of a latin root . 
  this happened centuries ago , so it is perfectly relevant to talk about centuries-old etymology . 
  it was an attempt at reddit humor . 
  is there really anything we have to continue arguing about ? 
  i recognize that the word is no longer in use . 
  that 's not an especially good analogy . 
  \u00d6ster - does n't have any meaning in modern usage , so it 's reasonable to assume that it means `` east '' or some variant . 
  meanwhile , `` deutsch '' does have a new , modern meaning : german . 
  one used to mean `` east '' and thus would still mean east , but deutsch means `` german '' in modern speech despite the fact that it used to mean `` popular '' or `` vernacular . '', 
  what point , exactly , are you trying to prove ? 
  that i 'm a dick ? 
  that i 'm wrong ? 
  that i 'm an ignorant american or something ? 
  i mean , this is n't a context to see who knows the most german - that would be you . 
  and , at least from my perspective , he was trying to undermine my post and being slightly condescending by stating that the current word is slightly different from the root that `` austria '' came from . 
  i was defending myself . 
  take a chill pill . 
  the difference is that you 're being hostile to a person . 
  i am being hostile towards a language - a non-personal entity . 
  * my own language * at that . 
  so i 'm not sure why you think i 'm being rude , and i do n't think that knowing the etymology of a word is especially ignorant . 
  sure , i was ranty , but that was the whole point !, 
  do you have to be hostile about it ? 
  `` east '' translates to `` osten . '', 
  not the exact same word , but it 's fairly clearly the same root . 
  you know , the european countries get along a lot better than anticancer states . 
  sure , getting to a unified federation will be a pain in the ass , but once you 're there ? 
  do you really want to be associated doth this pile o shit if trump is elected ? 
  well , you can always call it bohemoravia . 
  i hate the linguistics of this . 
  much . 
  \u00d6sterreich literally means `` eastern realm , '' which is super generic . 
  on top of that , when it was translated to english , they did n't change the \u00d6ster - to eastern . 
  they just it to austr - . 
  you know ... the exact same root word that means `` south '' in latin . 
  that 's right , south . 
  not east . 
  but then , we found australia . 
  so what did we do ? 
  we took the latin root that we already misused for the wrong direction and used it to name the fucking place . 
  dude , have you read a history book ? 
  it 's czechoslovenia . 
  and , of course , this was obviously a terrorist attack because he was of afghan heritage . 
  what ? 
  a new currency has to be built ? 
  mate , the uk has always used the pound ... 
  you know , the us and the uk are more similar than a lot of people think . 
  we have donald trump and the republican party , they have nigel farage and ukip , and both constantly spout bs nationalist rhetoric . 
  are n't most people here pro-eu ? 
  if there 's anything i know about politics , it 's that most people are either too stupid or too lazy to do actual research , so they just go with more or less the first thing they see . 
  i 'm not sure why i expected turkey to above this kind of thing . 
  oh wait , i did n't . 
  i 'm curious : does / r/europe appreciate american `` protection '' of many european states ? 
  is it necessary , in your opinion ? 
  could you defend yourselves in a military crisis ? 
  i 'm usually arguing to reduce the us military budget , which is often countered by saying that russia would then bully europe . 
  are they full of hot air , or do they have a point ? 
  i 'm open to both sides on this . 
  norway please stop being the best country in the world all the time leave some awesome for the rest of us ( switzerland , sweden , finland , netherlands : you 're cool too ), 
  note that i never said the us was exonerated . 
  this country has committed some very grevious offenses ( trail of tears , slavery , internment camps ) but i do n't see how it is particularly relevant to this discussion . 
  the us government wo n't apologize because we have too many hyper-patriots who think there is nothing wrong with america except for obama and a vague threat of `` socialism . '', 
  germany is not being hypocritical as they have profusely recognized , apologized , and made reparations for their actions in world war ii . 
  turkey has n't done a damn thing for the armenians , and even if germany was being hypocritical , it does n't make them wrong .
