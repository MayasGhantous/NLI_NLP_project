the paper reported that the plane was being chased across the baltic sea by a russian aircraft that had flown up from the russian enclave of kaliningrad . 
  is n't this something that should n't be buried in the article ? 
  so is this a europe vs usa thing to you , so you can stay away from the fact that numerous countries within europe ( aka europe ) are funding al qaeda to earn some short term political gain ? 
   the european governments do n't rely is much on weapons for their economy as the us does france , switzerland , the uk and sweden all have more of their economy exporting weapons than the us .

  i think part of it may be germany 's lack of response to russia about crimea , leaving poland thinking it 's on its own . 
  here in the us , the state only pays subsidies if you 're registering it in the state it 's available in . 
  west virginia offers $ 15,000 , but i live in a $ 7,500 state , so even if i bought it there , i 'd only get $ 7,500, 
  if that is what you wish , i will start burning all the fossil fuels we have . 
   east coast usa, 
  news articles like op 's are guaranteed to get upvotes due to worldviews and/or what people want to believe , just like your comment which `` could n't possibly be true '' , was `` stupid to ask '' or threatens their preexisting bias does n't mean the content is n't true , but confirmation bias will get posts places even without people reading the article or confirming facts . 
  even if it 's not the sole solution , i still think it 's a step in the right direction with free health insurance for the poor . 
  did n't the uninsured numbers drop from some 48 + million to under 10 million ? 
  wo n't some costs be reduced , along with insurance costs ? 
  i mean the max annual insurance rate you can pay for a family of 4 making $ 44,100 is significantly reduced to a maximum of 6.3 % of income . 
  that 's under $ 700/year . 
  how is it not ?

  it seems prevalent all over the world with immigrants . 
  i assume this is being used for economic purposes as well , as france has long been considered the worst economic espionage offender by both the us and germany for years now, 
   the french labour ministry said the rate of unemployment appeared to be slowing , with 177,800 people joining the jobless register in 2013 compared to 283,800 in 2012 . 
   the french unemployment rate is now 11.1 % . 
  it went up by 5.7 % in 2013 , and rose 0.3 % in december . 
  are n't these contradictory ? 
  why would the unemployment rate grow like that ? 
  can anyone eli5 what 's going on in france ? 
  true but i 'd still like to reserve the right to pull my kid from the public school system and home school him . 
  in my state , you can have part-time enrollment in school , allowing for homeschooled students to * take some classes ( often higher level math and science or electives like foreign language that parents do n't feel confident teaching ) * . 
  your child either has to be evaluated by an educator holding a master degrees or higher in education or take a nationally normed standardized achievement test every year to stay eligible for home schooling . 
  you must meet the same scores on the standards of learning tests ( chemistry , biology , math , history , reading etc ) as the children in public schools . 
  it 's not a free-for-all where the parents make up the education and the grades do n't matter . 
  nearly everything has to be approved by the state , and you can do whatever-you-want religiously . 
  they try very hard to weed out the kids being poorly homeschooled , and force those being educationally damaged back into public schools . 
  my ex-church 's religious classes were held at the church before school began , and had no type of funding from the state . 
  we were bused over to the school after our class . 
  if you 're in a shitty area , with a shitty school , and you feel you can educate your child better than the school can , and your child must meet or surpass the standards set by the school or else be forced back into public schools , why not ? 
  is that not a nice freedom to have ? 
  i do see where you 're coming from , though . 
  i 'm not trying to argue , just wanted to put my point out there . 
  today they may teach the right things ( in someone 's opinion ) but tomorrow they may not , why not secure the right to educational freedom now ? 
  is there something like [ dodd-frank ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dodd%e2%80%93frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act ) ? 
  it was used [ against siemens for bribery in asia by an asian resident ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/21/us-siemens-bribery-lawsuit-idusbre99k0td20131021 ) , but failed because * u.s. civil statutes do not apply to non-u.s. conduct * . 
  dodd-frank even rewards whistleblowers with cash if they report their employer 's wrongdoings . 
  you might want to have both for more protection , as why would someone blow the whistle if it means losing their job , as it was for this man in thailand ? 
   arm yes , they are significant and worth pointing out . 
  they are simply amazing !, 
  but industry size is what i 'm talking about when comparing us and europe in these posts . 
  there are annual revenues : * arm holdings : # 576.9 million ( 2012 ) or $ 950.8 million * imagination technologies : # 127.5 million ( 2012 ) or $ 210.15 million one of their main competitors according to wikipedia : * qualcomm ( us , snapdragon/adreno/wireless chips ) : # 15.14 ** b ** illion ( 2013 ) or $ 24.87 billion i 'm actually surprised arm holdings is n't making more , being market dominant and all . 
  of course , arm 's revenue seems only set to grow from here !, 
  same with imagination technologies ' powervr , their gpus are in a lot of devices . 
  seems there 's much more to be made in manufacturing them and tweaking them for products . 
  arm seems much more potent of a competitor commanding a huge marketshare , but their revenue and income are significantly smaller . 
  nokias run microsoft windows now , when will europe 's next phone os come out ? 
  do they have a large tv company ? 
  i know there is logitech , but that is one peripheral company . 
  laptops ? 
  monitors ? 
  game consoles ? 
  computer operating systems ? 
  i 'm not trying to make this a competition between who is the most advanced continent , or the most tech-savvy , i 'm just pointing out the differences in market size and amount of businesses towards this kind of tech .

  yep , as i had linked in my post , mass growth in london recently in the past four years . 
  not sure what 's with the downvotes without disputed facts : / just because there is slow broadband in the us does n't mean the tech industry is n't large , much larger than europe 's . 
  guess those computer numbers i remembered were out of date - i 'm a little bit out of it right now , but industry-wise the eu as a whole is n't as competitive in terms of opportunity in tech companies , from what i understand . 
  the industry and focus on the industry is larger in the us . 
  i 'm not really sure which numbers to look at though . 
  i must apologize for the huge wall of text in this post . 
  [ the most favored nations for high-tech companies ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-23/the-most-favored-nations-for-high-tech-companies.html )  22.9 % of us public companies are in the high tech industry * ( companies in that industry specialize in aerospace and defense , biotechnology , hardware , software , internet software and services , semiconductors , and renewable energy with a market value of over $ 1 million ( ~ 606,502 pounds ) and have been public for over a year ) * [ why ca n't uk spawn high-tech companies that go public ? 
  ] ( http://www.theweek.co.uk/prosper/55998/why-cant-uk-spawn-high-tech-companies-go-public#ixzz2oylrutuy )  `` an investment bank in the us will have 30 analysts specialising in particular aspects of the it industry . 
  in the uk , they might have one to cover everything from social media to cobol tools . '', 
   no wonder that , when the time does come to float , most roundabout firms will probably choose new york over london . 
  [ technology on the thames ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/technology/in-london-a-rising-silicon-upon-thames.html?_r=0 )  other cities in europe , like berlin , have budding tech scenes , but london has the benefit of its roots as a global financial center . 
  in the last four years , the number of tech companies in east london has roughly quadrupled , to around 1,400 , according to british government statistics . 
  the city also attracts more venture capital than european rivals like paris and stockholm . 
   still , london 's technology sector remains in its infancy compared with silicon valley . 
  in the first half of the year , london 's start-ups raised $ 351 million , less than 10 percent of the investment directed to companies in california , according to dow jones venture source . 
  i 'm not bashing uk at all ( london 's tech growth in the last four years has been astounding ! ), 
  but i 'm simply trying to point out the differences . 
  it 's hard to start up a tech company without proper funding , london attracts a ton of venture capital relative to most , but it is very small ( 1/10 ^ th the size ) compared to silicon valley , according to the article . 
  [ opinion piece on why europe lags the u.s. in technology startups ] ( http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/17/guest-post-why-europe-lags-the-u-s-in-technology-startups/ )  ... while europe has a larger overall population , it must cater to customers with different languages , media , cultures and currencies , all serving to add friction to innovation ( particularly in terms of marketing ) . 
  as a result , launching a product in the u.s. has a much greater chance of gaining traction and sufficient revenues to grow and prosper than is the case in europe . 
  related to what we 're talking about , except for canada : [ tech brain drain : a canadian problem ? 
  ] ( http://sarahtee.com/tech-brain-drain-a-canadian-problem )  like albert , hundreds of ontarians flock to san francisco 's bay area yearly -- joining 350,000 canadians , who according to the globe and mail , reside and work within the region -- eager to try their fortune in the world 's largest tech mecca . 
   but the huge influx of canadian employees leaving this country has created a gaping hole in the industry , creating a worrying tech brain drain . 
  350,000 canadians ? 
  that 's greater than ** 1 % ** of the total canadian population , just in the bay area in san francisco . 
  they 're likely educated too if they 're going to be working in tech .
