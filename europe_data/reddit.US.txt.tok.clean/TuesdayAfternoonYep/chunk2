  and very entrepreneurial if they 're going to actually move countries to get into this industry . 
  [ why canada is failing at tech ] ( http://business.financialpost.com/2013/07/10/why-canada-is-failing-at-tech/?__lsa=e4a9-b1cc )  this summer , facebook is cutting the ribbon on a brand new office in downtown vancouver . 
  the social media giant will employ some 150 staff , mainly recent software engineering grads from the area . 
  according to the company , vancouver was an ideal choice : close to facebook offices in seattle and silicon valley and attractive enough to pull in talented new recruits . 
   ... facebook 's new office has a one-year lifespan . 
  it 's a pop-up boot camp for training local software engineers and then shipping them to the u.s. 
  in fact , one year happens to be roughly the time required for a canadian engineer to secure a permit for full-time work in the states ...  rather than contributing to a homegrown tech scene , in other words , the new office will siphon off the already limited number of qualified professionals in the region . 
  it 's less a success story than a reminder of a chronic problem . 
  not to mention the large pay gap for software developers in the us vs europe , that can influence those to move for significantly higher pay . 
  check out what google 's pay and benefits are !, 
  sorry i did n't mean it like that , europe has always been an incredibly developed place , but in terms of computer adoption/software industry it apparently is n't so much , which is what the articles are talking about . 
  that quote is nearly straight from the article , and by tech it means more in the way of computer industry . 
  it is weird to me to see europe so when the population is so educated . 
  tech in this sense may be a more colloquial term in the us . 
  edit : do any downvoters have proof of the opposite ? 
  it 's always been measured that way in the us , however . 
  sorry , what do you mean ? 
  europe has unfortunately always been behind in tech adoption and startups . 
  even in the 60s , the us made 3/4ths of all computers sold to europeans and europe relied on us-made typewriters and telex machines . 
  [ here 's bill gates warning about the tech gap growing between europe and the us 14 years ago ] ( http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/03/17/223319/index.htm ) it seems to be a culture difference , almost . 
  edit : downvotes do n't make facts go away . 
  with germany and britain in such cahoots with the usa and surveillance , i honestly do n't have any more trust in european software than american software . 
  not to mention pointers to complicit european corporations in leaks . 
  huh ? 
  if creating your own software kept the nsa out , they would n't have access to south korea 's and china 's software to put in back doors . 
  if europe were capable of developing such hack-proof software , they would already have a larger marketshare , 
  that 's true too , it can become even harder to compare with different costs of living and products, 
  both are higher in the us, 
  to me , [ germany seems like a funny choice ] ( http://www.dw.de/german-reports-us-anti-terror-ops-based-in-germany/a-17229301 ) . 
   us agents arrested suspects in transit at german airports ... 
  sounds like if they really want to get him , they 'd get him at berlin tegel airport or at miami international airport . 
   `` germany is long a component of the american security architecture , '' said panorama . 
  german authorities `` often assist , '' said the s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung ( sz ) , adding that germany had long become a `` hub '' for america 's `` war on terror . '', 
  i think he can go somewhere safer ... 
  ah california , we got thru so many hoops to get the expanded data privacy laws past all the necessary government bureaucracy , the last step was for the governor to sign it ... anndd vetoed by him . 
  hopefully this new round , with all this extra momentum , will make lasting change . 
  is healthcare such a factor , besides mental care ? 
  obamacare is vastly expanding mental health care soon , making it much more available for americans . 
  does n't your original comment insinuate that actual crime rates have n't risen , or at least , not nearly as much as reported crime rates have ? 
  according to wikipedia ,  much of this [ crime increase ] has been attributed to a higher level of reporting of crimes , but the largest factor is the absolute increase of incidents of crime . 
   between 1995 and 2001 , according to interpol data , the rate of murder increased from 9.00 to 10.01 per 100,000 population , an increase of 11.2 % . 
  the rate for rape increased from 19.00 to 23.39 , an increase of 23.1 % . 
  the rate of robbery increased from 65.00 to 95.83 , an increase of 47.4 % . 
  the rate for aggravated assault increased from 616.00 to 667.42 , an increase of 8.3 % . 
  i can see rape being more skewed , but why else would robbery rates increase so much ? 
  would someone in 1995 sweden just not report a robbery to the police for some reason ? 
  i do n't know much about the culture so this is an honest question . 
  in the us , if you want insurance to pay out , you are required to fill out a police report - this makes the numbers closer to the real rate than countries who do not require this . 
  if someone did something to you that is a crime , you almost always fill out a police report . 
  i think it 's safe to assume people reported all murders , whether in 1995 or 2001 . 
  [ sweden does n't even have a crime decline ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/anm%c3%a4lda_brott_1950-2005.svg ) like the us 's , according to this chart . 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:violent_crime_rates_by_gender_1973-2003.jpg ) here 's hope for a better society and a significantly lower incarceration rate . 
  unfortunately , in all crime , sex , and murder rates , [ sweden does n't enjoy such reductions in numbers ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/historical_homicide_rate_in_stockholm.svg/771px-historical_homicide_rate_in_stockholm.svg.png ) as the us has . 
  they 're arresting less people ... but all the crimes are going up ... great ... !, 
  the un [ ited state 's incarceration rate ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:u.s._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png ) was actually much closer to sweden 's before [ prisons were privatized in the 80 's and the war on drugs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:us_incarceration_rate_timeline.gif ) . 
  thankfully , the sentiment against the war on drugs is strongly gaining momentum . 
  then why would reported crime be significantly higher in 2012 , than in 2010 ? 
  or even 2006 versus 2003 ? 
  notice how homicides have grown . 
  that is something you would report no matter what . 
  a stabbing and tramplings in switzerland ... 
  are there benefits to this method , over forgiving the consumer of the debt ? 
  yes , however in countries such as spain the bank will take your house and you still owe them the money , according to this article http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/world/europe/28spain.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 the article does n't go in depth with countries that forgive house foreclosure debt besides saying `` other countries in the eu '' though : /, 
  thanks . 
  do you know if those working minijobs often work in such export-related industries ? 
  with the german-us trade gap being larger than china 's , what does the us purchase from germany ? 
  with vw finally reaching ( or soon to be , ca n't remember ) half a million sales in the us since quite a long time , autos do n't make up very much of the total gap . 
  people going bankrupt from hospital bills is one of the silliest things to have happen , and it 's shameful to have your countrymen go bankrupt because they got sick . 
  i seriously hope obamacare addresses that enough . 
  one of our states , vermont , finally passed a single payer law that will come into effect in 3 years that is more similar to the health care system in the uk and canada . 
  before canada moved the whole country into universal health care one province had success with the rest following . 
  hopefully a similar trend would hit the us - it already is in minnesota . 
  hell , my state just recently kicked out our tea party government ( never thought it would happen ) and are replacing him with a democrat who is going to give free health care for the poor . 
  this is great news for all families . 
  for the first time , if you lose your job , the government has got your back on health care . 
  [ we 're almost done patching that shameful hole with the employee nondiscrimination act ] ( http://m.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-set-to-approve-gay-rights-bill/2013/11/07/05717e4a-47c1-11e3-a196-3544a03c2351_story.html ) yes , it 's late as hell but i 'm glad it 's finally here . 
  bush would n't dare pass such a thing . 
  walmart runs asda which is n't exactly free of criticism in the uk either , unfortunately . 
  wal-mart is literally crazy and when you get employed , wal-mart apparently passes off helping you apply for food stamps as if it were a program by themselves . 
  look how little we 're paying you , the government has to pay for your family 's food . . !, 
  also , the uk does have more personal debt than people in the us : / no where nearly as bad as south korea but still , worse to a significant matter . 
  in the past few years , the us has done significant household debt slashing while most other nations have had theirs grow, 
  norway admitted it , which is different than what germany did http://rt.com/news/norway-nsa-snowden-spying-us-965/, 
  like france and spain , this was collected by the national government and given to the us . 
  i 'm in an area next to two very often jammed up traffic lights due to extreme and rapid growth in my area from when it was originally built ( new construction has done an incredible job of helping it , though ) . 
  my area is ranking # 7 worst drivers with the highest collision claims and crashes per capita in the us . 
  after hurricane sandy , the lights were out for nearly a week until the local departments decided to put individual generators at the important intersections , but until then there were no traffic lights to guide the huge amount of traffic . 
  i 'm not sure why they finally decided to bring generators out to these important intersections , but i imagine it may have been from people complaining about it or some avoidable accident may have occurred ( my area loves to change up intersections after accidents , which is actually working ) . 
  similarly to one of the men in the video , i surprisingly felt it was faster driving that way . 
  less stopping , but everyone drove more slowly at lights . 
  i kind of preferred it , but i assume it 's only temporary until everyone gets used to new circumstances . 
  of course , we still have pedestrian crossings , stop signs , yield signs , and the like , but traffic lights have the strongest impact . 
  at what point does it become like driving in , say india or south america ? 
  we 're all used to so much order while we 're driving , taking it out temporarily seems to reap some benefits , but eventually , the order will decay , imo . 
  the order only lasts as long as people 's patience lasts , and once you see others committing minor offences it will only grow , such as driving seen in russia . 
  [ here 's some indian driving ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=rjreqag5jpm#t=25 ) and from my own personal experience , some south american immigrants drive like madmen until they adjust . 
  whoops , you 're right . 
  he lived there but had n't technically moved there yet until 2004 , i believe . 
  my post was actually misleading , now that i reread it .
