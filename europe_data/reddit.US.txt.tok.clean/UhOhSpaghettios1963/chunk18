  this is a terrible reading of history . 
  probably the dumbest thing you 've wrote to me so far . 
  not only is this [ not true ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/17/facebook-posts/are-george-w-bush-dick-cheney-unable-visit-europe-/ ) , if you arrested our politicians you would be promptly [ invaded . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_service-members%27_protection_act ), 
  sounds good, 
   no the us has not annexed iraq or afganistan , if anything they have done everything to get the hell out of those shitholes in last 8 years under obama . 
  and that 's why they 're so fucked at the moment, 
  cheers estonia !, 
  fuck communism, 
   okay , this shit is exactly why world war i happened . 
  two countries went to war and the rest of europe was like `` well fuck i guess we got ta fight too because we 're allies ? '', 
  oh give me a break . 
   so good on france for saying no to our militaristic bullshit . 
  yeah , until they want to blow up libya , then they come crawling back . 
   in my opinion , a crime against humanity with how many innocent civilians died pffffft hahahaha  in that conflict over the ego of a bunch of neocons who did n't get to kill saddam during the gulf war under bush i. 
  stop being obtuse . 
  it had nothing to do with `` ego . '', 
   we need allies to say `` nope not going to fight this war '' otherwise every conflict turns into a global conflict . 
  just like frances refusal to help in iraq ended our desire to fight there , right ? 
  oh wait , we just called them pussies and blew up iraq anyway . 
  sure , if ya talk funny, 
  if you make the comparison, 
  again , you 're the one who made the comparison in the first place ... you set the bar . 
  yeah , sure , it 's my bias , it 's not like america is a country that perpetually struggles with racism and gets along best with white christian nations , especially anglosphere ones . 
  no u, 
   eh , okay , so this might be a surprise , but germany isn \u00b4 t a synonym to europe . 
  true , but there is an obvious shift towards multiculturalism in europe in general , no ? 
   you might want to consider not replying to something where their purpose is obviously trolling . 
  you did that tho , not me  and what comes to the banning the burqa , that has nothing to do with the freedom of religion . 
  there isn \u00b4 t a single part in the quran where women are required to cover their face . 
  some muslims would disagree with you . 
   not only there is a security risk in burqa ( you are unable to prove your identity when your face isn \u00b4 t showing ) in america there are often requirements to remove the veil in the occasional circumstance this actually becomes an issue . 
  i do not see the issue with implementing that over there . 
   but when one is wearing something so extreme , the possibility of someone forcing it on you is pretty likely . 
  unless you can prove that every woman wearing it is doing so under duress , a blanket ban is 100 % unacceptable . 
   i am pretty sure you are confusing this with hijab , which is a completely different ballgame . 
  i am not . 
  i love the idea on paper but in practice i feel it has worked out to our net disadvantage . 
  empire is a rough , thankless , difficult job . 
  the user i replied to made the comparison, 
  i 'm a totally different dude , sorry for the confusion . 
  that alt right red pill shit is dumb as bricks . 
  i just think banning all these forms of islamic dress is counter productive . 
  banning the burqa strikes me as an unnecessary imposition on clothing . 
  if europe wants to fully embrace multiculturalism , that 's admirable , but i feel like that comes with respecting things you personally find distasteful . 
  respect freedom of religion a bit more , for starters . 
  well you 're not setting a very high bar , there . 
  the reality is that most americans and i have no interest in maintaining a world order . 
  that is why excuses are cooked up . 
  also 7/11, 
  american hegemony is no secret to anyone in the know , which is to say anyone who has interest in global politics . 
  telling the people that their sons are going to be shot , blown up and beheaded as pawns in a great geopolitical game is n't going to swell the ranks of your volunteer army , we need a `` bad guy . '', 
  the us came close to admitting it 's true purposes during vietnam with `` stopping the spread of communism '' and it 's the most unpopular american war of all time . 
  americans just want to exist safely in their own homes and like , not die due to political machinations . 
  remember , we are a nation with an occasional flair for selfishness . 
  no , there is an obvious pattern that emerges when you look at the reaction of the american public to wars , especially post-ww2 . 
  they start off popular enough , and the longer they drag on , the less popular it becomes . 
  the inevitable question is asked ; `` why the fuck are american soldiers dying in x country so far from home ? '', 
  the answer is almost never palatable . 
  your hypothetical invasion of syria will end the same way . 
  dead troops and no clear result except burnt cash and a pile of human carnage . 
  somewhat , yeah . 
   i do n't know how you can actually feel insulted that they did n't join our war over fictional wmds . 
  nearly everyone else did . 
   even americans wanted out within a few years of getting in . 
  americans have no stomach for extended war . 
  we want out wherever we go , if we even wanted to go in the first place . 
   bush 's lies so thoroughly discredited traditional american ... you think it was the wmd lie that turned us off middle eastern interventions ? 
  that 's absurd . 
  [ it was this , and it was always this ] ( http://standrewsnews.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/militarycoffins.jpg )  and you 're mad at the french ? 
  yes . 
  bush could have said we went to hunt nazi unicorns , that the french could n't be bothered to send even a token force is a slight . 
  i am , by the way , capable of being bothered by more than 1 thing at a time . 
  that may or not be so , but frankly to me it is irrelevant , it feels like a slight all the same . 
  i mean , even iceland sent 2 people . 
  france could n't send * 2 people * ?? 
  just seems shitty . 
  and most nations as i recall felt the same , but still helped , despite popular opinion . 
  look at the roster of the coalition , some nations are conspicuous in their absence . 
  i do n't doubt that , they 're a strong , secular , mostly white democracy that boosted us to victory in the revolution and has had a close relationship with us since that has sometimes been forged in blood . 
  especially looking at the other nations on that list , only india comes as a surprise . 
  but we also have some shitty popular perceptions of france too , i 'm sure you 're aware . 
  maybe it 's wrong to say they 're not popular , but there 's definitely a distinct undercurrent of disrespect too . 
  maybe i 'm taking shitposts and stuff too seriously . 
  with iraq . 
  considering our relationship both at the time and historically , i thought it was shitty that we could n't call in a favor regardless of how they felt about the justification . 
  haha yeah my comment was a [ direct reference . 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xafvr1069g4/tbx9fjgd7xi/aaaaaaaaaow/rwolliwljyc/s1600/new_york_post.jpg ) that said , i live in the area and even though that paper is trash , that is a 100 % self aware headline . 
  same with [ this one ] ( https://dontyouhavetimetothink.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/us-football.jpg ), 
  2023 seems right on time then, 
  broken clocks, 
  well , i do n't run in wealthy circles , but in my anecdotal , upper middle class experience in a liberal state , the nicest things i 've ever heard about france are `` it 's not fair to call them surrender monkeys '' , `` i hope the terrorists stop killing them '' and `` huge help in 1776 '' . 
  66 % of those polled said it was silly , and it was , but that does n't mean that those 66 % have a positive view of france . 
  i think the whole thing was dumb as fuck , but i 'm still pretty salty over them not helping and it hurt my opinion on them permanently . 
  usa wins 11-11, 
  \\* takes notes *, 
  fuck yeah , winning gold , silver , total and black medal counts !, 
  probably because that 's not what 's going on here at all . 
  you have to prove that these women are being forced to wear it , otherwise that falls apart pretty quickly . 
  france seems panicked .
