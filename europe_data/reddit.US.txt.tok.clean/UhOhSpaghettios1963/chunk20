  i 'm not shocked , but i probably should say my comment was a joke based around the massive level of influence the us has in the uk . 
  it 's not narcissism , it 's frustration . 
  oh come now , that 's ridiculous . 
  and here i was wondering the same in reverse, 
  they make up for it in spirit, 
  because they 're drunks, 
  yes , we do in fact lynch negroes . 
  never change , russia . 
  the nazis invaded because they regarded russians as an inferior people following an inferior system of government that needed to be exterminated and because they greedily desired russian natural resources but sure whatever step into my shower, 
  no americans want war and i presume i can speak for my eastern european allies too when i say that , but the option will never come off the table until you stop opposing the current world order . 
  i ca n't agree , that scene messes with the pacing of the movie and is mostly irrelevant to the tanker job , but though i did enjoy the end it was fairly cheesy . 
  dude could n't even cross the fucking channel let alone the atlantic . 
  nazi germany set the gold standard for delusion, 
  no way , fury got a soldier/civilian scene and it 's the worst in the movie , not that it 's very cheery anyway, 
  he cheated , does n't count, 
  because reddit fucking hates when you suggest that european wars are european problems, 
  yeah true that, 
  yeah buddy , hate to burst your bubble but that 's how this works . 
  russia/the soviets had a different idea how postwar europe should look than we did and have opposed american hegemony ever since . 
  it has absolutely nothing to do with `` distracting people at home '' both in the us and the ussr/russia . 
  to say that it does is the most naive , 3edgy5me thing i 've ever heard . 
  you said the us was '' so eager to invent a new enemy ( terror ) after their ally-enemy imploded during the 90s '' as if the 90 's were n't an excellent time to be an american , as if we needed to invent an enemy after those same people murdered over 3 thousand americans on a beautiful , peaceful september morning . 
  are you , in your truly infinite wisdom , gon na tell me bush did 9/11 next ? 
  grow up , dude . 
  then get a refund , or stop calling listening to hippie rants `` studying '' . 
  the united states opposes russia because russia opposes the american enforced world order that was established after the end of the second world war . 
  russia , and more recently , china , both work to chip away at american hegemony and they 're our opponents for that reason . 
  not complicated shit . 
  not if you put the life of a cop at risk . 
  you shoot at a cop , you 're gon na die . 
  good lord , that writer is a shithead . 
  i have it from reliable sources that your forests contain ewoks, 
  f. death metal, 
  not really , it 's higher than most of europe , and we have a larger population size too . 
  no , i 'm joking , calm your tits, 
  we built a wall , and made madrid pay for it, 
  look at my response to another person a bit below this, 
   saying that racism exist and that racism is bad , does n't explain how the `` black lives matter '' movement fights against it , and why therefore it 's necessary or good . 
   having a movement that says it 's fighting racism does n't actually automatically fight racism . 
  having a movement that says `` black lives matter '' does n't automatically help black lives matter . 
  i was n't asked that question . 
  i was asked why blm in the us is necessary , in my opinion . 
  however , if i * had * been asked , i would have replied `` by raising awareness to racial issues via protesting , and by pressing american politicians for action . '', 
   it seems to me that this specific movement only reacts when black people are killed by white people , and not when black people are killed by other black people , so if anything it seems to be actually making the opposite point than the one it 's claiming : `` black lives matter , but only when they are ended by whites '' . 
  this is a common criticism and it does hold some water , but it also neglects that the black community does work outside of blm to try to end black on black violence , and that blm is an anti-racist movement with a heavy focus on black/police interactions . 
  when confronted with tangible evidence of systematic , institutional racism , yelling `` but what about black-on-black violence ?!?! '', 
  is whataboutism . 
   that it was created after the death of trayvon martin by zimmerman is also a point against it . 
  that had been a case of clear self-defense , where zimmerman shot martin while martin was beating him bloody , and therefore zimmerman was rightly acquitted of wrongdoing . 
  as a vociferous 2nd amendment supporter , this is a huge black mark against them in my eyes , but i 'm still not foolish enough to pretend that racism in america is n't a tremendous issue . 
  using that morgan freeman video to ignore the horrors of racism is actually cliche here haha, 
  i do n't have to , not only is the burden of proof placed on those making a claim , it 's very reasonable to expect and american to know more about his own country than a foreigner . 
  would you expect me to be an authority on the brexit and it 's consequences ? 
  that said , i 'll play ball . 
  the united states has an issue with racism against blacks in particular as long as the united states has been a thing . 
  starting of course with the atlantic slave trade , black people were n't even citizens , instead objects , actual property of rich white folks . 
  some of the greatest americans who ever lived owned other human beings . 
  this major failing to show the slightest bit of basic human decency was n't resolved until the 1860 's , when we fought the deadliest war in our history and nearly destroyed the country in the process . 
  since gaining actual fucking personhood and citizenship , black americans have been treated like second hand citizens at best , really . 
  you 've got things like [ jim crow laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jim_crow_laws ) and the [ tuskegee syphilis experiement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuskegee_syphilis_experiment ) and random lynchings and shit going on . 
  all this shit leaves a legacy , and it 's alive and well here . 
  nowadays , post civil rights movement and desegregation , things are much better , but that 's a low bar to clear . 
  black people , and black men in particular , are funneled into the [ prison system at an astounding rate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school-to-prison_pipeline ) and treated [ poorly in the us cjs in general . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_in_the_united_states_criminal_justice_system ) . 
  they 're often neglected by government , unjustly shot dead by trigger happy ( being charitable ) police , they 're often [ overlooked by racist hiring practices ] ( http://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html ) and political parties sometimes work to [ undermine their vote . 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/10/09/report-voter-id-laws-reduce-turnout-more-among-african-american-and-younger-voters/ ) this is just scratching the surface type shit . 
  out of sight , out of mind, 
  if you think the existence of a group like black lives matter in the united states is unnecessary , i suspect you may be under the influence of drugs . 
  call the hague, 
  true , but we also did eniac , the first `` real '' computer . 
  we have a lot of things to wave our dicks about , i think the salient point here is the swedish op is an idiot . 
  fuckin ' monsters !, 
  tcp/ip was invented by the dod, 
  u high, 
  are * you * trolling ? 
  barely even a democracy ? 
  what are you , 12 ? 
  this reminds me of the people who wanted to build a mosque near ground zero . 
  they 're within their rights , but it 's a pretty shitty , tone deaf move . 
  bastards !, 
   between control of those facilities and the role the u.s. navy played in patrolling the atlantic , the british were forced to hand the americans the keys to the north atlantic , which was , after all , europe 's highway to the world . '', 
  this is only part of it , look up the [ tizard mission . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tizard_mission ) this is a super important happening that not many really know of . 
  i agree , let 's go home for good, 
  they were n't , but it did n't take long . 
  the world learned in ' 42 . 
  [ joint declaration by members of the united nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joint_declaration_by_members_of_the_united_nations )  the attention of the belgian , czechoslovak , greek , jugoslav , luxembourg , netherlands , norwegian , polish , soviet , united kingdom and united states governments and also of the french national committee has been drawn to numerous reports from europe that the german authorities , not content with denying to persons of jewish race in all the territories over which their barbarous rule has been extended , the most elementary human rights , are now carrying into effect hitler 's oft-repeated intention to exterminate the jewish people in europe . 
   from all the occupied countries jews are being transported in conditions of appalling horror and brutality to eastern europe . 
  in poland , which has been made the principal nazi slaughterhouse , the ghettos established by the german invader are being systematically emptied of all jews except a few highly skilled workers required for war industries . 
  none of those taken away are ever heard of again . 
  the able-bodied are slowly worked to death in labor camps . 
  the infirm are left to die of exposure and starvation or are deliberately massacred in mass executions . 
  the number of victims of these bloody cruelties is reckoned in many hundreds of thousands of entirely innocent men , women and children . 
   the above-mentioned governments and the french national committee condemn in the strongest possible terms this bestial policy of cold-blooded extermination . 
  they declare that such events can only strengthen the resolve of all freedom-loving peoples to overthrow the barbarous hitlerite tyranny . 
  they reaffirm their solemn resolution to insure that those responsible for these crimes shall not escape retribution , and to press on with the necessary practical measures to this end . 
  what a beast, 
  no ... no ... of course not , i 'm just asking for a friend, 
  does turkey have oil ? 
  doing lots of crack does n't count as traveling in time, 
  that 's dumb,
