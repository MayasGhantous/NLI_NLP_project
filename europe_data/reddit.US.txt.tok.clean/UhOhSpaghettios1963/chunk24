  if you really want to believe that the amount of black people is the reason america has lots of mass shootings , even more than in countries full of nothing but black people , then sure , whatever . 
  no shit it means low amount of black people , amongst some others . 
  there is a reason tiny fractions of america 's population commits the majority of homicides in the country . 
  when you oppress a group of people for centuries , they 're going to turn to crime to survive at a much higher rate than normal . 
  wake up and smell the coffee , bud . 
   i do n't see how that 's relevant . 
  mass shooters are not typically impoverished people . 
  of course you do n't , lol . 
  mass shooters are a fraction of gun crime in america . 
  stories of a dude kicking down doors with an ar-15 are a small minority of the shootings . 
  even then , those people should n't be walking the streets , they should be getting help they need in proper medical health facilities . 
  newsflash , people are n't shooting other people in reno just to watch them die , they 're doing it because they 're poor and need money , or they got caught up in gang violence or they 're high as fuck but coming down and need another fix or whatever . 
    you , at the same time , manage to own a very respectable amount of guns but ~ somehow ~ magically avoid the mass shooting plague . 
   yes , because nearly all civilian guns in sweden are hunting rifles good enough for charles whitman to shoot 49 and kill 16 at a distance in texas . 
  where 's your mass shootings ? 
  does n't gun ownership lead to mass shootings ? 
   and getting a hunting license requires multiple aptitude tests as well as waiting a few months ( usually ) for your application to go through oh no !, 
  my devious plot to murder as many people as possible , foiled by wait times !, 
   and once you get your license , you 're restricted to weapons which are deemed to fit the stated purpose of your license application ( which prevents you from getting your hands on the really school shooty ones using a hunting license ) so like ... all of them ? 
   you have to store them locked up at least this makes sense !, 
  even still , my state has this and it does nothing to curb the gun violence , though at least it probably keeps people from having their shit stolen . 
   `` dgus '' are illegal lel  and any weapons transported through a public place must be unloaded and if possible disassembled my state has that too and it did n't do shit except fuck average joes over . 
   and there is no gun worshiping culture like in america . 
  you ca n't just drive off and buy a gun at a gun show or wherever when you happen to feel like shooting some people . 
  most people do n't , and are background checked anyway . 
  does n't stop the crime . 
   oh , you 're certainly right about that . 
  for one , people with your attitude towards guns are basically nonexistent here , and thank fuck for that . 
  my attitudes are n't the ones killing people . 
  once again you have misplaced blame . 
  you 'll obviously agree where you live is nothing at all like where i live , so stop pretending your method is the one true way , because your understanding is very limited . 
  lol oops , phone autocorrect . 
  anyway , he 's one of the few researchers to find a low number of dgu 's , along with vpc , and he relies on the ncvs , known for problems with underreporting . 
  the ebil nra boogeyman does n't fund every study . 
  the majority of it 's power is derived from the millions of people who support it . 
  i gave you evidence of dgu use , you dismissed it . 
  whatever . 
   the only piece of evidence i need that gun control is not a waste of time is that i live in a society where i have the freedom of not having to fear mass shootings , while you live in one where people constantly get massacred in schools , clubs , movie theatres , churches , or wherever else they may go . 
  yet you 're brainwashed enough to think yours has the better approach to guns . 
  pitiful . 
  you live in a relatively lightly populated , culturally homogeneous nation with a strong social safety net . 
  you , at the same time , manage to own a very respectable amount of guns but ~ somehow ~ magically avoid the mass shooting plague . 
  what seems more relevant to you , genius ? 
  your apple is * nothing * like my orange . 
  you do n't know a thing about the us , but by all means - continue pretending . 
  it 's amusing , at least . 
  and * i * have enough experience talking with gun controllers to know hemingway 's bullshit when i see it , aka the straw you grasp at . 
  there have been more studies done than just the kleck study , and they have found a consistently high rate of dgu as well on top of all the other various pieces of evidence that gun control is a waste of time . 
  if you want a safe space where your precious beliefs are not challenged and you can pretend you understand american issues even nearly as well as an actual american , i suggest / r/gunsarecool . 
  no way , what 's * really * happening is the gun grabbers are just shooting themselves to promote their anti-gun agenda . 
  if you want to continue talking about this with me , keep the conspiracy theories to a minimum . 
   ** almost all ** national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are ** at least as common ** as offensive uses by criminals , with estimates of annual uses ** ranging ** from about 500,000 to more than 3 million per year ( kleck , 2001a ) , in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 ( bjs , 2010 ) . 
  on the other hand , some scholars point to radically lower estimate of only 108,000 annual defensive uses based on the national crime victimization survey ( cook et al. , 1997 ) . 
  the variation in these numbers remains a controversy in the field . 
  the estimate of 3 million defensive uses per year is based on an extrapolation from a small number of responses taken from more than 19 national surveys . 
  the former estimate of 108,000 is difficult to interpret because respondents were not asked specifically about defensive gun use . 
  they clearly give a high end and a low end . 
  explain it away however you like . 
  [ sure thing , pal . 
  ] ( http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#15 ), 
  it 's not cherry picking , considering all statistics indicate defensive gun use is higher than offensive, 
  1 ) no they 're not and 2 ) you do n't have to be a criminal mastermind to get guns , just have a halfway decent social life . 
  is n't it soooo annoying when foreigners come and impose their values on you ? 
  the independence is n't really necessary though . 
  if the us of e worked anything like the us of a does , you 'd still be free to draft your own laws and such , you 'd just be under the wing of a federal government . 
  from that trade off , you gain wealth , power and influence that you almost certainly would never have attained otherwise . 
  now , it 's true that it would be a trickier thing to pull off in europe 's case , considering that unlike the us , all of the people involved have long , rich histories before federalizing , but federal governments and nationalism are definitely compatible . 
  that 's like saying i can be pro new york but not pro usa . 
  you can be just as proud of your union as you are of your country of origin, 
  hahahaha yes you are, 
  eh a bit , it 's easy to be myopic over here . 
  i was talking about russia . 
  ca n't be the savior of europe if it is europe 's oppressor . 
  lol yeah , and because of it you had a pm less than half the country wanted . 
  very representative . 
  can you call it saving when you 're just eliminating competition ? 
  i think his incompetence is almost an asset , hillary 's experience is scarier to me than trumps idiocy, 
  this never fails to amuse me, 
  it 's because you see a lot more of us than we see of you, 
  surprised obama is so well respected here, 
   not saying that it has necessarily been a good policy at all times ( even though i believe that currently , there is enough reason not to be too friendly with russia ) , i am no fan of the russian government myself . 
  i simply question our level of involvement , both on moral grounds , and practical ones . 
  american presence ensures defense , but also ensures tension as well . 
  i ca n't say with true confidence that american troops are a net plus for european peace . 
   it has been one of the policy goals of your leadership . 
  and for that matter , it has been effective in accomplishing your goals . 
  no matter how benefitial achieving them is . 
  oh yes . 
  to the extreme displeasure of many south american and asian nations . 
  for instance , the vietnam war was effective wrt achieving our goals , but at what cost ? 
  sure , it stopped the spread of communism , but was it worth creating the dying , ptsd-stricken middle aged men missing limbs lying on the side of main street , usa , begging for money ? 
  `` if america 's soul becomes totally poisoned , part of the autopsy must read : vietnam . '', 
  - mlk jr.  i do not think that your side is much better . 
  both of your presidential ( presumptive ) nominees have been outspoken against these deals and your population is n't as free-trade friendly as it used to be . 
  i do not think that it is justified to shift the blame on either side . 
  funnily enough , one of the reasons why talks are not progressing is the fact that the us , the main advocate for free trade in the last decades , is n't willing to drop protectionist measures ( `` buy american '' ) . 
  you are 100 % right , we are culpable too . 
  i am wary of fta 's in general myself , and i am as you pointed out , not alone . 
   despite the british thinking otherwise , there has been a shift towards germany anyways in the last few years . 
  regardless , they are no longer around to go to bat for us as they so often have in the past , for better or for worse .
