  the submarine that is also always nearby , tapping phonecalls and other stuff for even more information . 
  the dccg is tiny . 
  the netherlands is one of many countries involved in interdictions in the caribbean . 
  they serve an auxiliary role . 
  this cooperation exists regardless of u.s. nato participation . 
  it is in the interests of all involved for it to continue , it 's not a pat on the back for ponying up 3/4th 's of the bill for our defensive alliance . 
   and defending own territory ? 
  it 's a different country that they operating in . 
  [ are these not yours ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caribbean_netherlands )  yeah 3972 soldiers from a war ravaged country is not much . 
  those men were n't totally not needed to rebuild the country . 
  yeah those soldiers in the gulf war did n't need supplies . 
  and those in the later war did n't need any intelligence . 
  ooh yeah there was no need to retreat outstretched us forces . 
  i admit , i have no idea what any of this means . 
  care to inform me ? 
   but hey , feel free to view yourself and your country as the greatest in your little warmongering brain . 
  the whole point of wanting to leave nato is to * avoid * any potential wars , but whatever makes you feel good . 
  it 's our problem because we make it so . 
  i say stop doing that , until there 's a tangible benefit to remaining in this relationship . 
   do you expect that your friends to help you murder someone ? 
  because a lot of usa started wars are like that . 
  e d g y. 
   there was help in the korean war , the gulf war , iraq war and in afghanistan . 
  `` help . '', 
  fair enough though , there was help in those places , as paltry as it may be . 
   there 's also a continuously effort to stop drugs coming to the usa by the dutch navy , which quite a lot finds more drugs than the us border guards ( of whatever organisation that is responsible to fight it ) you really think one boat , defending your own territories ( which happen to be in our backyard ) is really adequate for all we put back in ? 
  come on now . 
  appreciate the gesture tho , lol . 
  if something serious happens in europe , it 's up to europe to fix it . 
  there 's no obligation to follow us anywhere , but if you do n't , it 's kind of a dick move . 
  if i paid for the vast majority of my friends rent , and i could n't get him to help me out with a simple favor , i 'd tell him to go fuck himself and cut him off . 
  what ? 
  no country is completely altruistic . 
  even lend-lease came at a steep price for the u.k. . what i * am * saying that not only are the `` perks '' we receive unquantifiable at best , you 're a drag on the u.s. economy , the american populace , and u.s. military interests . 
  we 've been trying to `` pivot to the pacific '' for * years * now . 
  would you like to know why we keep having to put that on hold ? 
  this relationship is nearly totally one sided , and i personally want out . 
  it was the right thing to do , and i 'm glad we did it . 
  ( and so are [ you guys . 
  ) ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/americans-gave-their-lives-to-defeat-the-nazis-the-dutch-have-never-forgotten/2015/05/24/92dddab4-fa79-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7_story.html ) however , we were dragged into both of those conflicts . 
  the seas are ours , we can project power on an unprecedented scale . 
  remember [ these ] ( http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/images/collections/ships/nimitz-class/nimitz%20class_l.jpg ) that you guys are so quick to make fun of us for spending so much on ? 
  yeah , that 's how it 's done . 
  u.s. troops stationed in europe are there for your benefit , and yours alone . 
  as it is , they 're simply there as assurance that america has your back . 
  it 's not nearly enough to stop any attack russia would make against you . 
  it 's true that there 's perks to all this shit , but you 're fooling yourself if you think that those perks are even close to the same value as paying 3/4ths of the nato budget every year . 
  i mean honestly , what exactly do you think we 're getting out of this ? 
  we could n't even get the fucking germans to help us out against isis , or them and the french with iraq . 
  really ? 
  we * insist * on a completely militarily incompetent europe ? 
  we often pull troops out of places , only to return at a later date because our allies beg for it . 
  and i mean , even if that were true , that 's only the current 21st century zeitgeist . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/meuse-argonne_american_cemetery_081710.jpg ) because europe turned into a powder keg and the kaiser decided his world war was n't big enough . 
  [ this ] ( http://bfc6069c43f7ffbc5dba-0502af2ee568fe969e1c3ea7c42e34f6.r90.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/normandy_american_cemetery_memorial_coleville_france2.jpg ) because european governments rather elect and appease dictators than fight them . 
  when 's the next one , huh ? 
  are me and my buddies gon na be in one of these pictures soon ? 
  i have no interest in continuing this relationship . 
  it 's high time we back out . 
  this is n't our problem anymore . 
  maybe , but how many americans have to be buried in european soil before they figure their shit out ? 
  it 's a travesty tbh . 
  i 'd imagine so , i could give them the botd , but damn that really rubs me the wrong way . 
  looks like they have the same terrible excuses as they do over here , too . 
  you may not care about the treasonous aspect of the confederate battle flag , but it 's definitely a symbol of the enslavement of other human beings , and the schutzstaffel logo on that dudes plates shows their true motivations, 
  i did n't plan on it, 
   ernst tremmel was a member of the nazi ss guard team at the polish death camp between november 1942 and june 1943 , during which time at least 1,075 prisoners were gassed to death , prosecutors say . 
  whoops , he was ss . 
  the only reason this old man got to be an old man is because he did n't get what was coming to him sooner . 
  oh god , what have we done ... 
  we 'll just switch to powerade ... mwahahaha, 
   fun fact . 
  zero american athletes used meldonium . 
  so banning it , would target europeans only . 
  convenient , eh ? 
  fuck , you caught us . 
  no , apparently that 's mexico, 
   they want to live like the european aristocracy of old . 
  damn right !, 
   listen , i 'm not in the mood for a pissing contest . 
  if it 's really , really important to your self esteem that the us has a rich middle class , you 're welcome . 
  it was never a pissing contest . 
  just setting the record straight . 
  there are several things i could beat europeans over the head with , and vice versa . 
  you 're not going to catch me riding in on a shining red , white and blue horse looking to defend the healthcare system , for instance . 
  do n't say stupid shit , you wo n't get corrected . 
   but maybe you should ask yourself why it 's not even richer . 
  he median household income adjusted for purchasing power is virtually unchanged since the 60s . 
  the immense productivity gains of the last fifty years went exclusively into the pockets of the richest few percent . 
  who says i 'm not ? 
   know that patriotism is a warm , fuzzy feeling and the us is in dire need of defending from critical outsiders like me . 
  i 'm starting to think you 're the one taking this personally , haha . 
  how * dare * i challenge your erroneous assertions . 
   but maybe you should spend more energy asking how those few percent got away with it . 
  we already know how . 
  the problem is getting solutions passed through a system designed to work in a slow , incremental pace . 
   they even managed to brand any discussion in that direction as \u201e class war `` or \u201e socialism `` and turned those who should ask these questions into their staunchest defenders . 
  genius . 
  lol , america has always promoted the individual over the collective .
