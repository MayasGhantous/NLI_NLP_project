  we often do n't want to pay for each others shit . 
  it 's always been like this , and it 's working out just fine . 
  lol , the second link comes from the first link . 
  if you read either of them , and i 'm sure you did , you 'd know the u.s. compares quite favorably to to europe , despite our economy stagnating for a decade as a result of recessions . 
   the majority of the u.s. population is high income , making it one of only 10 countries ( among the 111 analyzed for this report ) where this was true in 2011 . 
  the other nine countries are australia , canada , denmark , finland , germany , iceland , luxembourg , the netherlands and norway . 
  pretty fucking exclusive , eh ? 
   it further describes the standstill of the us middle class relative to western europe and canada . 
  did you actually read and understand your linked article ? 
  yes it does . 
  it also shows that only a near complete standstill for 10 has allowed a handful european middle classes from overtaking the american middle class as a percentage of population . 
  we 're doing pretty alright over here , lol . 
  i 'm sure the fact that the american middle class is the size of denmark , finland , germany , iceland , luxembourg , the netherlands and norway 's combined populations is of little importance to you too .

  you know our middle class is stupid rich too , right ? 
  lol whether or not they fucked up was n't in question , was it ? 
  the point was his lack of insurance did n't play a role here . 
  source : 50 years of med school . 
  he was treated twice . 
  from your own source . 
   he went to the hospital complaining of abdominal pain , dizziness , a headache and decreased urination , according to the ap . 
  the records show that duncan reported his level of pain was eight on a scale of 10 . 
  doctors ran a series of tests , ruling out appendicitis and a stroke , among other ailments . 
  when the examination was over , the doctors prescribed him antibiotics and told him to take tylenol , an over-the-counter drug designed to relieve pain and fever . 
  and  over the weekend , duncan 's kidney function declined , he was placed on dialysis and was breathing through a respirator . 
  the hospital began treating duncan with the experimental antiviral drug brincidofovir . 
  lol . 
  how do you reconcile those facts with your uninformed worldview ? 
  you obviously have a grudge and i 'm no longer interested in entertaining your delusions . 
  have a good one , bud . 
  and you did n't read , and you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  even your article describes the patient being treated on two separate occasions . 
  please do not pretend to know what you 're talking about when the sum of your knowledge consists of a handful of newspaper articles over a few years . 
  you want my opinion on the fuckin ' brexit ? 
  yes , i am .

  rolled my eyes so hard i created a ef5, 
  his point is that we 're not dodging bullets on the way to work , the vast majority of violence is isolated to communities that the vast majority of americans do n't interact with at all save the occasional nervous drive through as a result of making a wrong turn , and outside of these areas is just normal western humans doing normal western shit . 
  well , people would sell their guns , just their old pieces of shit , in order to get money to buy new ones . 
  nasty , nasty people . 
  make america great again !, 
  this was ~ ~ quite popular ~ ~ tr00 kvlt in norway in the 1990s . 
   allright , thanks for letting me know what my post reads like to you . 
  this is n't an explanation of how your post in any way posits the argument that he should n't have been arrested , nor is it a rebuttal to my claim that you 're handwaving away a breach of human rights . 
  my suspicion is that you ca n't do it . 
  prove me wrong at any time you 'd like . 
  sorry but i have a one strawman policy per person , so do n't expect any more discussion atm . 
  lol , is it ? 
  you said , and i quote `` also there is no `` human '' right of free speech . '', 
  i 'd like to refer you to the [ united nations universal declaration of human rights . 
  ] ( http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ ) article 1 : `` all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . '', 
  forgive me if i agree with the un . 
  just in case that 's not enough for you , the [ european convention of human rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_10_of_the_european_convention_on_human_rights ) agrees . 
   what is scarier is living in a country with the incarceration rate of usa , regardless of your feelings towards `` free speech '' . 
  well i mean , if you continue arresting people for being nasty on twitter , you 'll have the same prison population very , very soon . 
  i do n't agree with american drug laws , considering drug use is ultimately a health issue , but it 's pretty easy to not run afoul of them too , and the vast majority of americans do . 
  including myself , even though i 'm breaking them as we speak . 
  not quite dachau , sorry . 
   but maybe europe is scarier for you because you enjoy harassing people in the street and ( more importantly ) on social media as well , especially right after a mass murder ? 
  i mean , more like because i know the history of speech in europe and generally speaking when it is restricted , it [ often ends in horror . 
  ] ( http://www.beaconforfreedom.org/liste.html?tid=415&amp;art_id=475 )  also i do n't know what else to say after the brilliant rebuttal '' `` lol , dat butthurt '' . 
  i think that seals the deal  i mean you clearly are , this had nothing to do with america until you tried to make this about it , obviously as a result of you feeling defensive . 
  very transparent . 
  apologies , europe is lovely but this is absurd . 
   you would be surprised to learn that your `` philosophical '' views on rights etc are indeed cultural . 
  culture is not only about eating sauces . 
  there is so much more to it . 
  no shit , but i 'm sure you 've heard the story of charles james napier 's reaction to the custom of sati : `` be it so . 
  this burning of widows is your custom ; prepare the funeral pile . 
  but my nation has also a custom . 
  when men burn women alive we hang them , and confiscate all their property . 
  my carpenters shall therefore erect gibbets on which to hang all concerned when the widow is consumed . 
  let us all act according to national customs . '', 
  as the joke about sauce and stoning was meant to illustrate , not all cultural practices are made equal . 
  some are reprehensible . 
   i feel the same way when it comes to americans and their guns too , but i understand its a cultural thing . 
  feel free . 
  that 's a discussion worth having , and while i 'm sure you you 'd argue that the consequences of the ** undeniable freedoom ** that comes with state allowed gun ownership is not worth it , i 'm not going to hand wave it away like an uber defensive asshole , either . 
  well , that 's what makes nato so successful , they simply can not compete . 
  and as for the pak fa , maybe , we 'll see . 
  it will certainly be outclassed and outproduced by the f-35 . 
  yeah , no doubt . 
  do n't forget the navy either . 
  still , for all of the russian miltary problems , they 're still a very competent fighting force , and the pak fa is n't even out yet . 
  but again , that says more about the us and the uk . 
  if the order of the best air forces on the planet are 1 ) us 2 ) uk 3 ) russia , that still makes them among the best on this planet . 
  that says more about the us and uk . 
   innocently asking someone to `` explain brussels '' ( like they were buddies who casually met in the street and chatted ) and going off on an fit of internet anti-muslim rage is not the same thing really . 
  innocently ? 
  he was n't looking for a refresher course in brussels 101 , he was holding that random woman personally responsible for the attacks , because she is brown , therefore a terrorist . 
  despite what you may believe , using a crude word like towelhead , and personally holding a person responsible for islamic terrorism because of their skin color and/or their religion are not all that far removed from each other . 
  both are extreme expressions of ignorance , one just has a smidge more tact than the other . 
   as i said you can argue that he should n't be arrested but no need to pretend he asked an innocent question . 
  could you explain to me which part of `` yeah , but if you read just the title , you can get angrier and wage your internet war against tyranny . 
  can you do that if you calmly assess the situation ? 
  nope . '', 
  is you arguing that he should not have been arrested ? 
  because from where i stand , those sentences read like the sarcastic hand-waving of a person who thinks this is acceptable , and not really a big deal . 
   also there is no `` human '' right of free speech .
