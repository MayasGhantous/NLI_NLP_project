  trump himself is nearly elected as it is and he got through 16 other relatively sane people to do it . 
  the internet loved bernie but he was beaten in the voting booth , by a million . 
  you honestly believe we 'd get better candidates if we revamped our entire election system ? 
  not really , no . 
  that 's the most ridiculous thing i 've heard today , we got who the people wanted,

  best for everybody involved that you just take your bike somewhere where being in a traffic accident is n't a very likely occurrence .

  i am not tr00 kvlt enough to listen to music , true, 
  they have a bicycle lane , you can see in the gif that the cyclist is using it and still runs into a door , because again , he insists on competing for street space in the largest city in the us , where there is n't enough room to swing your own dick . 
  it does n't really matter how i feel about it one way or another , they 're going to continue being hit , because they insist on riding in the streets of the biggest , busiest city in our nation . 
  it 's simply amusing to me to see the inevitable happen . 
  take that shit somewhere else where there 's room for it . 
  the gif of that new york cyclist getting doored brought a tear of joy to my eye , they 're the worst,

   is hollande delivered a sharp critique of the obama administration in comments published wednesday , calling washington afraid to use its power to stop the bloodshed in syria but too eager to wield its economic might to penalize european companies . 
  not quite what dicky had in mind, 
  consider it 200k , professionals double tap, 
  ca n't we just drone this guy ? 
  i 'd be happy to source an easy rebuttal of that when i get home , but i 've been dicking around enough at work as it is , lol . 
  feel free to google my arguments though , if you ca n't wait . 
  edit : okay , a little late , but here we go : [ hegemonic stability theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hegemonic_stability_theory ) [ pax americana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pax_americana ) [ the globalization of politics : american foreign policy for a new century ] ( http://www.cfr.org/world/globalization-politics-american-foreign-policy-new-century/p6330 ) [ citi bank on the end of pax americana ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/citi-on-pax-americana-end-2016-1 ) [ why american leadership still matters . 
  ] ( https://www.aei.org/publication/why-american-leadership-still-matters/ ) ( i 'm sure you 'll disregard this because it 's aei , but attack the arguments , not the source . ), 
  honestly , this is kinda international politics 101 , i almost ca n't believe anyone would deny this . 
  it 's like saying that the world progressed in spite of the british empire because of the bengali famine . 
  it 's pretty fuckin ' rediculous . 
  look , i get that you do n't like the iraq invasion and stuff and as an isolationist i do n't at all either , but you ca n't deny the facts that are plain as day just because you do n't like them . 
  well , if you insist . 
  not really , no . 
  what , do you think that we just became the world 's dominant , most liberal power , but left no trace of that other than wars ? 
  are you even trying to remain objective here or no ? 
  you may oppose many us actions on moral grounds but you can hardly argue with the results . 
  well , i guess you can , but it 's not a very good argument . 
   that 's absurd . 
  there was also stability , wealth , education and prosperity in rome , for example , or in many other periods of history , you 're just being an ethnocentrist . 
  no , it 's not , and no , i 'm not . 
  it 's true , there were periods of time with large amounts of prosperity and stability , but none comparable to the one we 're living in now . 
  this in particular is indisputable . 
   and if we were to accept that argument ( which is a big ` if ' ) , the relative calm in the western world has more to do with decolonization , europe stoping warring each other , and the european union . 
  decolonization plays a role , but often a negative one . 
  decolonization was n't always a peaceful affair . 
  however , europe does n't war with each other because of american hegemony , the invention of nuclear weaponry , and the creation and success of the united nations . 
  the eu is just an economic union for the benefit of eu citizens . 
  aligning economic interests of course contributes to overall stability , but it 's of secondary import . 
   actually , the us is the most warmonger country in the west in the last 100 years : korea , vietnam , iraq i , iraq ii , syria , afganisthan only in direct interventions . 
  and you can add the dozens of times the us as armed rebels or directly overthrown local governments : chile or iran , for example hey , do n't sell us short , we 've done more than that !, 
  yes , those conflicts/interventions all happened , and ignoring the `` warmonger '' label which carries all the nuance of a freight train , small isolated conflicts have happened , and will continue to happen throughout history . 
  the point is that they happen less often and at a smaller scale in modern times . 
   in fact , all this daesh/isis shit is directly related to the 2003 invasion of irak ( which by the way had only economic interests , * cough * cheney/rumsfeld * cough * , al quaeda armed by the us to fight the soviets in afganisthan , etc. ), 
  well for starters , nations do n't lift a finger without first considering the economic implications . 
  running a nation is n't a charitable organization . 
  and we had a handle on that isis shit until we were kicked out . 
  they were virtually annihilated .
