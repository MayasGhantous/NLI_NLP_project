  such accusations are lazy , unsophisticated and tyrannical . 
  race-treason or race-traitor . 
  use the same words in a science fiction book in which the earth is being invaded by hostile aliens , and most people would n't call it racist . 
   herrenrasse `` master race '' . 
  a historian could use it in a historical context in which a society is split along racial lines between masters and slaves , and it makes sense to refer to the `` master race '' and the `` slave race '' . 
  doing so would not make the historian a racist . 
   rassenschande i could imagine a future scenario where we not only have gmos , but `` genetically modified people '' . 
  a person could say the human race is being `` polluted '' or `` defiled '' without having any racist notions . 
  this could be used as an insult in a non-racist context , e.g. 
  referring to rapists or child-molesters . 
  i do n't think it 's harder to build than the largest planes from boeing or airbus . 
  it 's just that it has greater cargo-carrying capability , and the startup costs of designing and producing * any * jumbo jet are astronomical . 
  if you can get by with a 747 or an a380 in 99.99 % of cases , you 're much better off renting the an-225 for those last few cases than producing it . 
  if the an-225 did n't exist , it would n't be produced . 
  they would simply find alternate means of transportation , e.g. 
  a combination of ships , trucks , helicopters , etc. 
  which may end up being extravagantly expensive and slow , but still far superior to designing and producing an an-225 , in the few cases where it was needed . 
  any word that can be used to express racist ideas can be used for something else . 
  the word itself is never inherently racist . 
  can you think of any counterexamples ? 
  having a connotation , or invoking a mood is something a lot different from ( and far short of ) `` being racist '' . 
  this seems pretty awesome . 
  i love huge planes . 
  the idea that a * word * can be racist is idiotic . 
  more crap journalism . 
  the author has no interest whatsoever in any contrary or cautionary opinion from any party , no matter who it may be . 
   us europeans could care less . 
  how much less exactly ? 
  except in cases where you did n't . 
  ( e.g. 
  referendum results against the lisbon treaty ) in those cases , your rulers basically told you to fuck off , they knew what was best for you better than you did . 
  it 's not , actually . 
  it 's in the eu 's interest to reform itself into the kind of organization that countries want to be part of . 
  not to hold countries hostage by threats and retaliation . 
  http://www.economistsforbrexit.co.uk/ you 're the one who made a claim about `` virtually all economists '' , not me . 
  dumbass . 
  ok , sure , i broke that rule . 
  in the future , you should be more specific in your accusations . 
  so , far from showing that * virtually all economists * agree that it will be a `` big hit '' , you had to settle for citing * one * economist who thinks there are * reasons to believe * that it will be * somewhat * of a `` hit '' , in the long run ? 
  that 's quite a climb-down . 
  and i 'm sure krugman himself would include the caveat that it depends heavily on what happens between now and `` the long run '' -- specifically the balance between potentially more trade with the rest of the world and potentially less trade with the eu . 
  it is you who do n't know what `` editorializing '' means , if you think it applies to one title but not the other . 
  or do you think the guardian is a fountain of objective truth , its word is gospel ? 
   virtually all economists agree that brexit ( not brexit vote ) will be a big hit to the economy . 
  * citation needed, 
  i support unbiased news reporting . 
  the title is exactly as appropriate as [ brexit camp abandons # 350m-a-week nhs funding pledge ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/527jvb/brexit_camp_abandons_350maweek_nhs_funding_pledge/ ) . 
  no more , no less . 
  no actual arguments , then ? 
  sad , but typical . 
  why would the eu vindicate the butthurt remainers ? 
  it 's in the economic interests of both the eu and the uk to reach an amicable arrangement . 
  no more brain-dead than the people who voted remain due to fearmongering about economic collapse . 
  the point is , there was never a pledge to increase nhs funding . 
  only the promise that parliament would have the option to spend the repatriated funds that way . 
  if the subtlety of the point was lost on some people , so be it . 
  but you still ca n't call it a pledge . 
  advocating something is not the same as promising that it will be implemented . 
  conflating the two is brain-dead . 
  some remainers do n't seem to understand the difference between pledges and ideas . 
  i never heard anyone * pledge * that more money would be spent on the nhs as a result of brexit , only people saying `` let 's do it '' , and `` we could do it '' . 
  indeed since the leaders of the major parties were against brexit , it would 've been mighty presumptuous for brexiters to * pledge * anything , not having the power to implement it . 
  sorry , i forgot that this sub has a fair number of people with common sense in it . 
  i was referring to the regressive-leftist mainstream of europe . 
  criticizing something is not the same as censoring something . 
  i suggest you look up both words in a dictionary . 
  i guess this is the `` wrong kind '' of censorship , therefore all of you euros are united in your righteous indignation . 
  [ the war against genetically modified organisms is full of fearmongering , errors , and fraud . 
  ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/07/are_gmos_safe_yes_the_case_against_them_is_full_of_fraud_lies_and_errors.html?wpsrc=sh_all_tab_tw_top ) the eu 's arbitrary and pathological opposition to gmo technology is n't something to be proud of . 
  [ original version ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flexcit ) was published in 2013 as a submission to the [ brexit prize ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_union_membership_referendum,_2016#exit_plan_competition ) competition . 
  [ this ] ( http://eureferendum.com/themarketsolution.pdf ) was published years before the referendum , and has been continuously developed . 
  i agree . 
  the point i was making before was that the 1975 referendum * as presented to the uk public * and the 2016 referendum were not asking the same question , so a new referendum on eu membership could not legitimately be a `` tiebreaker '' . 
  okay , but the crucial question to me is , did the uk voters believe they were voting for something that would necessarily become a federal europe ? 
  or did they believe they would have plenty of future opportunities to forestall any further integration they did n't like ? 
   the eec was presented as a step toward federal europe from day 1 . 
  ( even the ecsc was presented as such the day it was created in the 1950s ) . 
  i would be interested to read any supporting sources . 
  my understanding is that the goal of [ ever closer union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solemn_declaration_on_european_union ) came later . 
  everything i 've heard from british people who participated back then indicates they did n't believe they were voting for a process to join a federal europe . 
  maybe it was sold to the public differently in the uk than in the other european countries . 
  yeah it is . 
  it 's a stretch to say the two referendums were voting for the same thing . 
  so you 're saying that the first referendum was about joining the eec trade bloc and `` whatever the eec might transmogrify into in the future ? '', 
  that referendum came long before the maastricht treaty . 
  it was about joining a trade bloc ( the eec ) not a superstate ( the eu ) . 
  you 're entitled to your opinions . 
  are you being intentionally obtuse ? 
  the referendum was a vote for the right to be ruled by british people , not a vote to institute referendums as the primary democratic mechanism . 
  british leaders are most definitely more qualified and more likely to act in favor of british interests than foreign bureaucrats . 
  that 's what the referendum was about . 
  nobody knows what the outcome of the decision is going to be . 
  it 's likely going to be neither the unmitigated boon predicted by proponents nor the unmitigated disaster predicted by people of your ilk . 
  but the fundamental * interests * on either side of the channel have n't changed , so the cross-channel agreements established after brexit are n't likely to be much different , either . 
  it would be worse than that . 
  if it happened in the u.s. people would be seriously talking about a revolution or secession , there would be riots , government buildings burning , militias forming , hoarding of twinkies , etc. 
  in the u.k. 
  i 'm not sure what the equivalent would be . 
  mobs in guy fawkes masks marching on parliament ? 
   i truly hope this hurts the uk .
