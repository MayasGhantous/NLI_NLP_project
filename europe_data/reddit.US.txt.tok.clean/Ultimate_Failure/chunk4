  bmw costs significantly more than an equivalent honda , ford , etc. 
  therefore blowing all of that extra money on it is by definition a luxury . 
  sorry , i ca n't explain it any clearer than that , so if you still do n't get it , we 'll have to drop it . 
   all german cars vws are german cars . 
  there are about 3 % of americans who have ever heard of this . 
  i think it 's a recent fad . 
  would you prefer that nazism be germany 's only cultural export ? 
  and of course oktoberfest has everything to do with germany . 
  to pretend otherwise is asinine . 
  it may not be celebrated exactly the same , but it is clearly a product of german culture . 
  when you have to pay more for something , and the alternative would meet your needs , that item is by definition a luxury . 
  hth . 
   you can try and market the golf as a luxury car , does n't mean i 'm going to buy that narrative if it simply is n't one ... you 're a bit deluded . 
  i do n't know anyone who considers vw a luxury brand . 
   i 've never seen anything even close to a good plain regular pretzel in the us . 
  i do n't think they have them . 
  can you provide a link to what you are talking about ? 
  we have a dizzying array of pretzel options , although you ca n't buy them all at a grocery store . 
  i love pretzels and want to know what i 'm missing . 
  fail . 
  you took a breath in the middle !, 
  well , yes , of course . 
  polish is a fully expressive language . 
  and english has some redundant features , just like any other natural language . 
  but the `` a/the '' distinction is nonetheless useful , for efficiency . 
  i guess there 's a reason there are n't any [ spelling bees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spelling_bee ) in other languages . 
  it allows for more efficient communication by relying on shared awareness of objects in the world . 
  usually there is a `` default '' item that you can refer to with `` the '' , or you can refer to some other example of that item with `` a/an '' . 
   turn on the tv . 
  this refers to the `` default tv '' -- a particular tv that everyone knows about . 
  probably the tv in the same room with you . 
  if there is more than one tv in the room , it does n't work -- the reply would be '' * which * tv ? '', 
   turn on a tv . 
  this refers to * any * tv , even if there is a natural `` default tv '' that everyone would agree on . 
  `` turn on any tv , i do n't care which . '', 
  well you 're an expert , in a way . 
  let me ask you ... 
  when you communicate in english , do you feel that your thinking is subject to certain cultural biases that are different from when you 're using german ? 
  some studies have shown it can affect thought and behavior . 
  therefore by wiping out other languages , you are actually eliminating diversity and you might be diminishing the human species . 
  [ how language can affect the way we think ] ( http://ideas.ted.com/5-examples-of-how-the-languages-we-speak-can-affect-the-way-we-think/ ), 
  i think developing a reliable universal automated translator should be among the highest priorities for research funding in europe . 
  i do n't think forcing everyone in the world to learn to speak english is a good thing . 
  there are many unique and valuable facets of various cultures that would n't survive the resulting cultural homogenization . 
  not to mention it 's a colossal waste of effort -- effectively a huge tax on everyone whose native language is n't english . 
  perhaps being next to the baltic sea ? 
  england = jolly old, 
  do german houses have mostly masonry walls on the inside , instead of drywall ? 
  much smaller . 
  it seems to be a type of [ plastic screw anchor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wall_plug ) . 
  `` to denounce a race of people they would have to be fully human before . 
  this is not the case with jews . 
  zionist propaganda is what it 's called here . '', 
  actually it was their `` astronomy picture of the day '' for october 24 , 2010 : https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101024.html, 
  it 's earth 's first line of defense against an alien invasion . 
  did you watch the [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azevfd4c6ow ) ? 
  a strong contender . 
  interesting choice . 
  why ? 
  that video gave me r/frisson, 
  itt : a lot of racists who do n't believe arab muslims are adults who can be held responsible for their own actions . 
  does this kind of thing work as a substitute for debate in germany ? 
  just denounce the source and move on ? 
  that 's a problem for china , not the u.s. * `` if i owe you a pound , i have a problem ; but if i owe you a million , the problem is yours . '' * -- john maynard keynes, 
  thanks for the intricate explanation . 
  reminds me of why i 'm not a lawyer . 
  i 'm admittedly reading it for the first time today , but it 's subtitled `` prohibition of abuse of rights '' and says  nothing in this convention may be interpreted as implying for any state , group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the convention . 
  which implies that citizens would n't have the right , for example , to advocate abolishment of certain rights protected in the echr . 
  although on closer reading , rather than prohibiting that form of speech , it 's actually only refusing to protect it , which i guess would n't technically prohibit member states from protecting it . 
  it depends on whether you believe the subtitle or the specific wording of the article . 
  this article really does n't seem to belong in the document at all . 
  article 17 of the echr would seem to proscribe forms of speech that are protected by the 1st amendment . 
  i would also think the 1st amendment is problematic . 
  it protects `` hate speech '' among other things . 
  the correct preferred translation now would be czechia , based on the stated wishes of the czechs . 
  i do n't understand your hostility towards me . 
  you seem like a really crappy person . 
  who said i believed it ? 
  i in fact submitted `` czechia '' as an alternate translation . 
  you should n't put words in people 's mouths . 
  aww , poor little estonia . 
  that would be one way to get rid of the syrian refugees . 
  the bill of rights would need to be scrapped , too . 
   tschechei google translates it to `` czech republic '' , fwiw . 
  i am more than happy to use the term `` czechia '' , if that is the term that the people there prefer . 
  it seems appropriate , historically precedented , and more natural than `` czech republic '' . 
  but they need a better pr campaign . 
  most people simply are n't aware of the new name yet . 
  whatever . 
  you 're a `` bush lied , people died '' zealot . 
  so be it . 
  there is no evidence that anything powell said was a lie . 
  it was an analysis based on the best available intelligence . 
  saddam had a well-documented history of * use of wmds against his own people * providing support to terrorists in palestine and elsewhere * obstructing un inspections of his previous wmd programs none of that was disputed by anyone at the time . 
  the only thing that was lacking was incontrovertible evidence of current wmd programs . 
  it turned out that he either dismantled them or transferred them to syria before the iraq war . 
  regardless , if saddam had been left in power , it was generally assumed to be only a matter of time before he supplied wmds to terrorists . 
  being wrong is not the same thing as lying . 
  hth . 
   as the audience shouts `` god save the king/queen '' .
