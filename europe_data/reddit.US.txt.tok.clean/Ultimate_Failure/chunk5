  what ever happened to good old `` the king/queen is dead . 
  long live the king/queen !, 
   except that when the line of succession is unclear , it 's influential individuals who choose who the next monarch will be . 
  not a problem . 
  god decides who among the influential individuals is successful . 
  if you 've invested heavily in the world 's most expensive hammer , every problem looks like a nail . 
  we have a few nude beaches . 
  i 'm not sure about saunas ; the few saunas i 've been to have contained non-naked people . 
  as for gym locker rooms , i can see all the naked dudes i want , but the locker rooms , showers and toilets are sex-segregated . 
  is that different in the uk ? 
   beaches , saunas , gyms ... yeah , we have all of those too . 
  unfortunately . 
  i find it hard to believe you are a historian . 
  who are these other historians you are referring to who `` wistfully idealize '' the british empire ? 
  that 's career suicide . 
  edit : i note that you removed the word `` historians '' after posting your reply below . 
  agreed , everything in iraq was perfect under saddam hussein . 
  that 's kind of irrelevant . 
  i mean we have free internet porn in the u.s. . we can even watch people pissing on each other when we want , unlike you poor bastards . 
   it generally is seen as something for very desperate people . 
  that does n't make sense . 
  it would make sense if you were talking about seeing a prostitute . 
  but why would a `` desperate '' person choose to increase his frustration by going to a strip club where he is n't allowed to have sex or even masturbate ? 
  i agree . 
  western fronts have been problematic for you guys . 
  it 's best to ~ ~ annex ~ ~ get the french on-side at the outset , then proceed with standard wwx protocol . 
  overrun belgium , obviously . 
  i would n't deprive you of that fun little diversion . 
  then try to beat your record in russia . 
  you must wear a sheriff 's uniform to maximize the effect . 
  most of r/europe still does n't believe it will happen . 
  several articles are posted every day trying to convince the british that it 's a bad idea . 
  [ oh , slough ... i do n't know how anyone could put you down ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwf_zoe6rpm ), 
  ah , let me guess , every * actual * implementation of communism in history has n't been `` true '' communism , correct ? 
   and one thing i can not understand is how in the us , christian values are associated with individualism , when actually christianity is all about loving thy neighbor and helping . 
  how is that compatible with the wild west mentality ? 
  for example universal healthcare seems like something that christians would definitely want . 
  two points on this : 1 . 
  for conservatives to support both individualism and christianity , they do n't have to be compatible . 
  they just have to both be characteristic of previous times in this country ; hence something to be `` conserved '' . 
  christianity preaches * voluntarily * helping your neighbor . 
  if you are * forced * to help your neighbor by someone taking your money and giving it to someone else , christianity gives you no credit for being moral ; being victimized wo n't get you into heaven . 
  christianity also condemns the person who took your money . 
  futhermore , the fundamental philosophy of christianity is based on self discipline . 
  christians view life as a constant struggle to rise above our base urges and instincts . 
  when we have impulses towards sloth , greed , envy , pride , etc. , ... then it is our individual responsibility to deny ourselves those indulgences , according to christianity . 
  ha ha . 
  if only everyone could be smart enough to see the superiority of * ad hominem * over debate . 
   come back when you find a single democrat who advocates workers controlling the means of production , until then , so long !, 
  under communism , workers do n't control anything . 
  the government ( i.e. 
  the communist party ) controls everything . 
  compare to obamacare . 
  * yawn * i guess your audience in r/askeurope might be fooled , so carry on if you wish . 
  edit : i should add that there are many democrats who disavow the `` communist '' label but who actually believe everything communists believe , and do n't realize it . 
  it has to do with the history of the countries . 
  conservatives are generally called `` right-wing '' . 
  if in the past your country was a communist country , then it makes a certain amount of sense for communists to be thought of as `` conservatives '' and hence `` right-wing '' . 
  the usa was founded on principles of `` rugged individualism '' , human rights , free markets , judeo-christian values , etc. 
  so our `` conservatives '' support those ideals . 
  our `` left wing '' ( `` liberals '' ) are essentially communists ( although the term has such negative connotations that few of them would admit to it ) . 
  if you believe there is something good about european culture that 's worth preserving , then you are likely to be identified by at least some people as `` rightist '' and also likely to oppose an organization that supports unlimited immigration , ignoring the will of the population . 
  i think if the eu had sensible immigration policies , it would have a lot more support on the right . 
  after all , a bunch of small countries can defend their interests more effectively if they work together . 
  because the sky is falling . 
  that is interesting omission in the english civil law tradition . 
  i ca n't think of a reason why not to allow one-sided contracts . 
  have you ever heard an argument ( practical or philosophical ) against them ? 
  it 's usually faster to fax something ( requiring less human time/attention , anyway ) than to scan it in and e-mail it . 
  also , there is a long legal precedent establishing faxes as admissible in courts of law . 
  maybe because the way it 's used in english is nonsensical . 
  `` surely you jest '' if read according to the rules of grammar , would mean something like `` you jest in a self-assured way '' . 
  but what it actually means is `` i am sure that you jest '' . 
  very few people have a vocabulary larger than about 80,000 words . 
  for the other 2.92 million we have to use the dictionary , or just figure it out by context . 
  that 's because we stole everyone else 's words . 
  we 're not stingy , though . 
  here , take as many as you want . 
   preoccupied google translate suggests * absorto * , * abstra\u00eddo * , and * ocupado anteriormente * . 
  how about a direct translation of the original usage of `` please '' in english ? 
  `` hand me the screwdriver , if it pleases you to do so . '', 
  why would anyone sign such a contract ? 
  sorry , my imagination is failing me at the moment . 
  lol . 
  to be fair , i do n't think that concept actually exists in real life . 
  very vivid imagery , though . 
  hmm , that 's odd . 
  i wonder why it is n't being heard by the supreme court . 
  according to wikipedia , the [ high court ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_court_of_justice ) is a court of england and wales only . 
  which high court are you referring to ? 
  wow . 
  it 's crazy that the war cabinet had that much power , to just decide to merge the country with france . 
  could the pm do the same today ? 
  why did you use the word `` whilst '' ? 
  what was the rationale and justification for this ? 
  it 's a mitchell and webb skit . 
  you ca n't do it without mitchell and webb . 
  i do n't know why moronic tv executives think shows need to be remade to be appreciated by an american audience . 
  although , in the case of the office , ricky gervais was too lazy to make more than 12 episodes , so that was an exception . 
   they also took our kol\u00e1\u010de and started to put sausages , ham , pepperoni or sauerkraut in it .
