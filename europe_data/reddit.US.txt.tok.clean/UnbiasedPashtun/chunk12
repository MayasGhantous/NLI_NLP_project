  * groningen should have gone to friesland instead . 
  * zuid-brabant is a better name than vlaams-brabant . 
  * the two flanders should merge like how the two limburgs merged . 
   alfred the great completely kicked their shit in . 
  they semi-colonized a large portion of the region before that happened though . 
  okay , thanks . 
  [ this page ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ie#suffix ) has a list of them and it includes czech and compares it with similar sounding suffixes but i ca n't find an etymology on it . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-y#english ) is the page of the english * - y * suffix and here it says its related to dutch * - ig * but nothing on czech so the czech suffix probably comes from latin , which would make more sense anyways considering how influential latin used to be . 
  you claimed that people would get killed for being gay in the past which is why there are no records of gays . 
  however , we do have records of `` gays '' ( closer to bis but whatever ) , just not the kind you were hoping for . 
  we have records of people doing all sorts of wrong stuff and getting punished for it . 
  having gay sex was a capital punishment in many countries and people were met with punishment for it , yet child abuse persisted despite all that . 
  i 'm just asking you why none of the recorded figures lusted after adult males . 
  its a simple question . 
  * gay pedophilia -  death penalty . 
  but it still existed . 
  * adult gay sex -  death penalty . 
  but it never still existed . 
  why ? 
  just say its an artificial new modern concept and that you are okay with that , it takes the sugar coating off why you want to promote it as just as normal as heterosexuality which will help further discussion . 
   besides , lets just say all gays used to be pedos . 
  how is that relevant today ? 
  this means that is not natural and just an artificial lifestyle invented by the media . 
  i 'm just against unnatural stuff being promoted . 
  the main reason though is that it hurts the birth rate and then goes down a slippery slope . 
  the * - ia * in english comes from latin e.g. 
  however the * - y * suffix in english comes from old english e.g. 
  italy , germany , tuscany , saxony , etc. 
  the czech * - ie * looks like it would be pronounced similar to the english * - y * ( or am i wrong ? ), 
  which is what got me interested . 
  dutch also has the * - i\u00eb * suffix for country names by the way . 
  french has a similar * - ie * though in words like saxonie , albanie , hongrie , etc. 
  so i think it most likely came from latin but i 'm not sure if the czech * - ie * came from latin or germanic . 
  it 'd look weird on the map then . 
  better to give them a neighboring part of poland instead . 
   `` police not welcome-zones '' one of your compatriots in this thread said that police have a heavier presence in those `` no-go zones '' than they do in other places . 
  i 've seen many people from various european countries that thought they were real . 
  people from eastern europe have a darker view of sweden than those from usa do which is why they 're so opposed to immigration from mena countries . 
  its obvious that sweden is not the rape capital of europe , but right-wingers rarely use any critical thinking . 
  like sweden would have a higher rape rate than russia or moldova lmao . 
  according to the same stats that sweden is the rape capital of europe , those same stats will have sweden having a higher rape rate than third world african countries , yet if you tell right-wingers that sweden has a higher rape rate than somalia ( by using the same stats that puts sweden at # 1 in europe ) , then they 'd lose their tops saying the stats are full of bs . 
  but the same people that say sweden has no-go zones never deny america not having any . 
  fox news used it in regards to birmingham . 
  sweden having no-go zones probably came from swedish right-wingers . 
  the categories are very broad and inclusive . 
  mali is likely to be on the lower end of the countries colored orange . 
  and even if its not perfect , its 1000x more accurate than those other `` stats '' that say sweden is the rape capital of the world . 
  its interesting because there 's a theory that the turkic bulgars ( who bulgarians get their name from ) trace their origin to the people of the [ kingdom of balhara ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_balhara ) who were a people from modern day afghanistan . 
  do the irish know exactly where prague is ? 
  its the name that slavs have for germany . 
  it means `` mute '' i.e. 
  one who ca n't speak like us , to contrast with * slovo * which means `` word '' ( although some say that the term slav came from * slava * which means fame ) . 
  basically , those that slavs could understand were slovo and those that they could n't understand were `` mute '' ( nemets ) . 
  what does the origin of the * - ie * suffix in czech ? 
  which language does this come from ? 
  what about sicily ? 
  lol , of course albania and serbia would still border each other :p, 
  and force russia to give them kaliningrad . 
  russia also has a similar gdp per capita to mexico . 
  sure you were , since you commonly post here . 
  afghan refugees ( who are mostly pashtun ) coming to pashtunkhwa ca n't be compared to arabs going to poland ffs . 
  this poll is a repost , i 've seen it well before brexit . 
  that does happen occasionally , but so do terrorist attacks and higher criminal activity . 
  i brought up black christians because they do n't have much of a cultural connection to either spaniards or poles/hungarians . 
  they 're also seen as an `` undesirable '' group by many in europe . 
  many do migrate to europe , whether they are refugees or not , but the issues are comparable . 
  because of conservatism , eastern euros would be less likely to accept * any * type of non-euro immigrants than western euros . 
  the polish/hungarian opposition to muslims is more in regards to the terrorism/criminal activity they associate muslims with rather than purely ideological hatred . 
  poland accepted lipka tatar muslim refugees in the past . 
  of course ideology plays a role , but i 'm sure ethnicity does as well . 
  europeans do n't see bosniaks and somalis the same . 
  its a commom stereotype that spaniards and to a lesser extent south americans detest being compared to mexico . 
  i said black christians , not west asian christians . 
  quite a contrast between hungary and romania even though hungary is more developed . 
  no , it has nothing to do with that . 
  poland and hungary are just much more conservative countries . 
  i bet they would also be less likely to take black christian migrants/refugees than spain . 
  many latin americans refer to their language as castilian . 
  both are correct , but czechia is shorter/easier to use . 
  spain has the lowest percent of people that agree . 
  thanks , at least you are being intellectually honest which is rare when having these debates . 
  they do n't have to be personally fed up . 
  they read the news and see what 's going on in western europe and want to avoid new headlines like those in their own country . 
  what does * blavero * mean ? 
   what i do n't get is , why are they downvoting you ? 
  is it so controversial ? 
  i end up with 20-30 + of downvotes every time a thread like this comes up . 
  it goes against their pro-lgbt worldview where gays have always existed since the beginning of time and gays exist in every society . 
  the main problem with people that claim homosexuality exists everywhere is they think `` gay sex = gay person '' . 
  people that had gay sex were just depraved dudes who wanted to take advantage of boys for the most part , they were not gay . 
  [ in some societies that are almost completely disconnected from western society , the concept of homosexuality * still * does n't exist . 
  ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/where-masturbation-and-homosexuality-do-not-exist/265849/ )  gay people were not seen as ` gay ' , you had men who were men and then men who ` perverted ' the natural order by ` taking it like a woman ' . 
  that 's how they saw it . 
  they did not overly mind men who fucked other men -- they saw it as a vice , certainly , but not much more than having a fondness for prostitutes . 
  the real kicker was being the passive partner . 
  then you 're a shameful catamite . 
  as long as you were super manly , you could absolutely get away with what we would call ` gay stuff ' today . 
  true , but i should point out that men never had sex with other adult men and men were never romantically attracted to other men . 
  they used little boys as sex toys to avoid impregnating their wife and they took advantage of the boys who they could treat simply as a toy ( something they did n't see their wives as for the most part ) . 
  historical figures that engaged in gay sex such as alexander , mahmud , leonardo da vinci , michelangelo , etc.
