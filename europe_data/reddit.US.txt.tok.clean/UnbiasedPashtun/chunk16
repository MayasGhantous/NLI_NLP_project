  [ only 20 percent of identical twins are both gay leading researchers to believe that there must be causes which are not inherited . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/15/homosexuality-may-be-triggered-by-environment-after-birth/ ), 
  actually , there is a lot of historical data on gay relationships , but they were virtually all between men and young boys . 
  and these men were pretty much all married with their own wives . 
  aristotle was one of the men who had sex with young boys despite being married . 
  he claimed the reason why so many people do this is because they do n't want to get their wife pregnant . 
  also , i already gave you a link earlier burying any credibility of the claims that people are born into a sexuality ( whether gay , bi , asexual , etc. ) . 
  people become gay based on environmental factors otherwise genetically identical twins would all have the same sexuality , but only a minority of gay people with a genetically identical twin share the same sexuality as them . 
  the concept of a sexual orientation was invented by liberals . 
  the earliest instance of the word homosexual appeared in the late 19th century where it was described as a sexual orientation . 
  gay sex has existed since ancient times but it was just a side thing by [ mainly married ] men against young boys . 
  `` catch up '' ? 
  their views are n't exactly backwards/wrong . 
  just because they are in line with what had been occurring in all of history until modern liberalism created the concept of sexuality does n't necessarily mean they need to change .

  they are catholics but they are n't true representatives of catholics . 
  true representatives of catholics properly following their religion would be those very religious catholics . 
  they are only based on the follower ( s ) around the foundation of the religion/sect . 
  you ca n't just make up your own rules and then say this is the proper version of the religion you practice . 
  if you do that , then you 're starting a new school of thought . 
  no , they are based on religious texts . 
  followers can pick and choose whatever part of the religion they feel like following depending on their history/culture/education / background . 
  yeah , the catholic church is n't perfect , but that does n't mean they should openly violate the bible as much as they can to appease the masses . 
  are n't there different degrees of sin ? 
  which religions ( the dogma not the followers ) are progressive and tolerant ? 
  the eating shellfish is clearly applied only to jews . 
  we know that forbidding gay sex was applied to non-jews as well because it was specified as such . 
  18:22 -30 , `` you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female ; it is an abomination . 
  23 also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it , nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it ; it is a perversion . 
  24 do not defile yourselves by any of these things ; ** for by all these the nations which i am casting out before you have become defiled 25 ` for the land has become defiled ** , therefore i have visited its punishment upon it , so the land has spewed out its inhabitants . 
  26 but as for you , you are to keep my statutes and my judgments , and ** shall not do any of these abominations , neither the native , nor the alien who sojourns among you ** 27 ** ( for the men of the land who have been before you have done all these abominations ** , and the land has become defiled ) ; 28 so that the land may not spew you out , should you defile it , as it has ** spewed out the nation which has been before you ** . 
  29 ` for whoever does any of these abominations , those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people . 
  30 ` thus ** you are to keep my charge , that you do not practice any of the abominable customs which have been practiced before you ** , so as not to defile yourselves with them ; i am the lord your god . ' '', 
  do religious christians still exist among ethnic icelanders ? 
  [ the difference in gdp per capita is nothing huge . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qoe4mv3.png ) also , large scale albanian immigration to macedonia seems like it is something that should n't be happening . 
  macedonia has had an issue with albanian separatists in the past , so you 'd think that they would be a little strict regarding immigration from a country that has so many people trying to claim its land . 
  not to mention that albania is the homeland of all albanians so many macedonian-albanians could seek migration there because they will feel more welcome and integrated . 
  according to the map , ** people born in albania are immigrating ** to macedonia . 
  their birth country is albania and they are leaving it for macedonia . 
  why is that ? 
  that does n't explain why people from albania are going to macedonia . 
  why are so many albanians going to macedonia ? 
  i would have thought that ethnic albanians from macedonia would be going to albania instead similar to how croats and serbs from bosnia are going to croatia and serbia . 
  yep . 
  there 's a styria ( steiermark ) in slovenia as well where its called \u0160tajerska . 
  although in slovenia , its more of a cultural/historical region rather than an administrative unit . 
  who said it needed to be ? 
  are history articles not allowed on this sub or something ? 
  you confused slovenia with slovakia ... 
  muslim countries ( with maybe a few exceptions ) have been getting more religious since the islamic reawakening in the 1970 's . 
  its lyub-lya-na . 
   their language is unique in the sense that it 's the only slavic language with a dual case ( not 100 % sure if it 's the only one ) . 
  sorbian and chakavian have it as well . 
  hungary is balkans ? 
  i always saw it as a west slavic country that speaks a uralic language . 
  i 've also seen hungarians swearing at others for calling hungary a balkanite country . 
  slavs migrated from pannonia to modern slovenia in the late 6th century . 
  before the slovenes migrated to modern slovenia , the population consisted of romance speakers . 
  before them were the illyrians . 
  croatia was founded by the croat tribes , serbia by the serb tribes , and slovenia by the carantani tribes ( who get their name from the gaulish carni ) . 
  slovenia 's name used to be carantania ( karantanija ) and then became carniola ( kranjska ) later when the romans occupied it . 
  carniola shares a common root with kranj , carinthia ( koro\u0161ka ) , and carnia . 
  currently , slovenia and slovakia are the only slavic countries not named after a tribe but their country 's names refer to just slavs in general . 
  if slovenia changed its name back to carantania , then they would return to their tribal name rather than be known as generic slavs/slovens and they would avoid confusion with slovakia . 
  the kaykavian language in northern croatia is said to be very closely related to the slovene language . 
  its closer to slovene than it is to shtokavian ( serbo-croatian ) . 
  slovenia has the highest gdp per capita for any slavic country ( making it the most developed slavic country ) and i 've heard its the most westernized slavic country as well . 
  in the czech language , bohemia and czechia have the same name . 
  so why would it cause a controversy if they have the same name in english ? 
  still , it feels a bit wrong that southeast france was completely cut off from the burgundian identity even though burgundians had the most influence there . 
  so there 's three burgundies : duchy of burgundy , county of burgundy , and kingdom of burgundy . 
  the duchy and county seem to have become the modern day burgundy administrative region of france ( which got merged with free county ) . 
  however , the region where the kingdom of burgundy used to be completely lost any remote sense of burgundian identity . 
  why is that ? 
  why was n't the southeast of france named burgundy instead ? 
  a kingdom seems more deserving of the name burgundy than a duchy or county . 
  not really . 
  bohemia and czech are the same thing . 
  bohemia is the historic name of czechia . 
  nowadays , western czechia is called bohemia but ethnic czech and ethnic bohemian are synonymous . 
  holland is a sub-region of the netherlands but bohemia was used for the name of the entire country . 
  i hope anglophones do n't start saying `` czechian '' now . 
  the spelling should have been changed from ` czech ' to either ` check ' or ` chek ' . 
  the spelling ` czech ' is a polish spelling and seems really out of place for english . 
  the ossetes and karachay-balkars are descended from the alans . 
  the ossete republic in russia is called north ossetia-alania . 
  karachays and balkars are turkified alans and even refer to themselves as alan in their language . 
  russians renamed the place azerbaijan and then musavat embraced it . 
  why is ireland doing significantly better than the uk ? 
  was n't the moldavian ssr originally part of romania and not ukraine ? 
  the republic of azerbaijan 's name was artificially changed from albania to azerbaijan by the russians in order to lay claim to the original azerbaijan in iran ( known as iranian/south azerbaijan ) and form a `` greater azerbaijan '' . 
  the natives called it * aghwan * whereas the persians called it * arran * . 
  caucasian albania has no relation to the albania in the balkans by the way . 
  how are they less of an ethnicity than the portuguese ? 
  many consider themselves an ethnicity . 
  besides , even if they technically are not an ethnicity , they have their own language/culture/identity that goes back many centuries . 
  the civil war was just about the south wanting to separate because of political differences . 
  southern americans are n't an ethnicity with their own language or anything .
