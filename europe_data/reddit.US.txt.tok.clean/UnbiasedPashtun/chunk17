  its not comparable to catalonia . 
  maybe catalonia can be compared to hawaii if hawaii was native hawaiian majority and they wanted to separate . 
   this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons . 
  what is the reason ? 
  i do n't see any obvious reason why you should make a throwaway account for this . 
  -- anyways to me , having a country is about having an identity . 
  the economic stuff is not that big of an issue in the long run imo . 
  i mean if ukraine joined russia , then it would probably be better economically , but to them ( and most people ) identity comes first . 
  do you see yourself as spanish first or catalan first ? 
  to the whole world in diplomatic and sporting stuff , you are seen as a spaniard . 
  if you separated , you would be seen as a catalan . 
  do n't worry , she 's only suggesting people should do it out of their own will to help the migrants ( which is still dumb ) , not have the government actually spend money on it . 
  besides , she has no power . 
  these are just empty words . 
  turks then got conquered just like how celts in britain got conquered . 
  besides , the turks were n't native anyways . 
  but the russians were in crimea before the ukrainians . 
  russians have lived there for centuries . 
  nobody is truly native to crimea , the crimean tatars came from asia not too long before the russians . 
  russians are the vast majority there . 
  why is it okay for estonia to want to be independent from the soviet union but not okay for crimea to want to be independent from ukraine ? 
  source ? 
  this happened with northern ireland . 
  the brits populated ni with british people ( mostly from scotland ) and then decided to be loyal to the uk while the remainder of the island declared independence . 
  bretons are not native to armorica , but came as refugees from britain . 
  moroccans are n't native to any parts of france or a significant majority anywhere in france . 
  i 've looked at all the examples they gave . 
   in the southern chinese province of fujian , through the ming dynasty period , ** females would bind themselves in contracts to younger females in elaborate ceremonies . 
  [ 6 ] males also entered similar arrangements . 
  ** this type of arrangement was also similar in ancient european history . 
  [ 7 ] pederasty . 
   an example of egalitarian male domestic partnership from the early zhou dynasty period of china is recorded in the story of pan zhang & wang zhongxian . 
  while the relationship was clearly approved by the wider community , and was compared to heterosexual marriage , it did not involve a religious ceremony binding the couple . 
  [ 8 ] the source for this story \u592a\u5e73\u5ee3\u8a18 is a collection of legends and tales . 
  if you follow the link , it says that the source is very ambiguous . 
  it was written in the song dynasty in 978 , over a millennia after the fall of the zhou dynasty . 
  not to mention this was the only mention of such a story . 
   some early western societies integrated same-sex relationships . 
  the practice of same-sex love in ancient greece often took the form of pederasty , which was limited in duration and in many cases co-existed with marriage . 
  [ 9 ] documented cases in this region claimed these unions were temporary pederastic relationships . 
  [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] these unions created a moral dilemma for the greeks and were not universally accepted . 
  [ 17 ] pederasty again . 
   at least two of the roman emperors were in same-sex unions ; and in fact , thirteen out of the first fourteen roman emperors held to be bisexual or exclusively homosexual . 
  [ 18 ] the first roman emperor to have married a man was nero , who is reported to have married two other men on different occasions . 
  first with one of his freedman , pythagoras , to whom nero took the role of the bride , and later as a groom nero married a young boy to replace his young teenage concubine whom he had killed [ 19 ] named sporus in a very public ceremony ... with all the solemnities of matrimony , and lived with him as his spouse . 
  a friend gave the `` bride '' away `` as required by law . '', 
  the marriage was celebrated separately in both greece and rome in extravagant public ceremonies . 
  [ 20 ] the child emperor elagabalus referred to his chariot driver , a blond slave from caria named hierocles , as his husband . 
  [ 21 ] he also married an athlete named zoticus in a lavish public ceremony in rome amidst the rejoicings of the citizens . 
  [ 22 ] more pederasty . 
  not to mention that nero was a freak who did many contemptible stuff . 
  if you keep reading , the only examples they can give are pederasty . 
  if the only examples of gay unions are of men molesting little boys and a single fictional story with 0 proof , then this does n't look too good . 
   you 're delusional if you think people become gay because of the media . 
  if that was true , there would n't be gay people in muslim countries . 
  muslims are rarely gay in the same sense as westerners are . 
  they 're `` straight '' dudes that will resort to having sex with a guy only in the absence of a female . 
  there are a few gays in muslim countries , but there are more environmental factors than the western media . 
  besides , muslim countries are n't isolated like north korea . 
  they do pick up on what happens in the west . 
  there are many cases of genetically identical twins where one twin is gay and the other is straight . 
  [ see this . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/15/homosexuality-may-be-triggered-by-environment-after-birth/ )  having lots of partners would n't have been a problem if sex ed was n't horseshit like it is in the us . 
  sex ed is the same for straight people as well . 
   as for the pedophilia , it seems to me that these adult gay males grew up in a repressed environment which caused these fucked up attitudes ( old gay males seeking younger boys to catch up with their lost time , this is not a new rhetoric ) . 
  just like how ( according to you ) nobody chooses to be gay , why would anybody choose to be a pedo ? 
   as you can see , your homophobia is what causes you to be homophobic . 
  looking at this from a historical and biological lens shows that they are not born that way . 
  rus ' is just the old name for russia/russians . 
  it is a predecessor to russia . 
  rus ' language = old russian . 
  old russian evolved into moscowish russian , ukrainian , and belarusian . 
  new york was just named after york , there was no evolution involved . 
  new york is n't a successor to york . 
  russia is a successor to rus ' both culturally and politically . 
  the name rus ' evolved into rossiya similar to how englaland evolved into england . 
  where is the contradiction ? 
  i never denied russian being slavic or any of that . 
  russkiy is just an evolution of the name rus ' , they are practically the same thing similar to how anglo and english are . 
  ukraine itself realizes this which is why [ it wanted russia to be called muscovy . 
  ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/2016/02/21/verkhovna-rada-mulls-requiring-ukrainian-officials-to-call-the-russian-state-muscovy/ ), 
  the invasion was still very relevant in the overall scheme of things . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_invasion_of_rus' ) :  the invasion , facilitated by the beginning of the breakup of kievan rus ' in the 13th century , had incalculable ramifications for the history of eastern europe , including the division of the east slavic people into three separate nations , modern-day russia , ukraine , and belarus , [ 2 ] and in the rise of the grand duchy of moscow . 
  were all east slavs not considered one ethnicity before the mongols invaded ? 
  if i 'm wrong , then just give me your viewpoint . 
   homosexuals would n't have kids regardless of what you think . 
  they would n't be homosexuals if the media did n't promote it as normal , so they would have kids . 
   they 're overrepresented in stds because of the poor sex ed since gay people tend to be marginalized in homophobic societies its mainly because they 're very promiscuous . 
  they have way more partners than straight guys . 
   never heard of such overrepresentation in pedophilia . 
  https://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=is02e3  people who identify as 100 % gay make up such a tiny amount of the population today , there are people that identify as gay as opposed to bisexual/pansexual/etc . 
  this is a completely modern phenomenon . 
  in english , its montenegrin . 
  ukrainians and belarusians used to be considered ethnic russian before the mongol ( golden horde ) invasion . 
  after the golden horde invaded , the plc annexed ukraine and belarus , and then they developed a separate ethnic identity . 
  the name rus comes from the ruling scandinavian elite . 
  kievan rus ' is just a name coined by historians , it was just called rus ' . 
  alaska would have been invaded by the british and become part of modern day canada if the russians decided against selling it to usa . 
  and they are # 1 in bandy , which is a sport closely related to ice hockey as well as their national sport . 
   katherine bangs a few `` stallions '' complete myth .
