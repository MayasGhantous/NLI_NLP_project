  are `` charnegos '' accepted as real catalans ? 
  her comparisons with hitler are obviously not as prominent though . 
  they compare trump to hitler often , but they do n't believe he is going to * actually * do concentration camps or targeted mass killings or anything like hitler did . 
  many people also say hillary is going to cause ww3 . 
  when they say trump 's gon na sart ww3 , they say that cause he comes off as a wreckless lunatic . 
  the hitler comparisons come from the way he talks about minorities and his nationalistic tone . 
  people just point out that trump and hitler both had divisive and nationalistic rhetoric . 
  nobody actually thinks trump is literally hitler 2.0 . 
  yes , but nobody lives in the far north which is lappish anyways . 
  the map just looks weird with the way it suddenly cuts off that part of norway . 
  estonians are genetically different from finnish folk from finland . 
  they are genetically closer to baltic-speakers than to finlanders . 
  okay , they are compared . 
  i read it wrong initially but see it now . 
  what do you think about the pca plots i used ? 
  they 're much more accurate ( due to showing multiple samples ) and easier to read . 
  dimension 1 and dimension 2 are just proxy names for the x and y axes . 
  the closer any two points are to each other , the genetically closer those listed peoples are . 
  for example , the blue circles ( representing the english ) are closer to the blue squares ( representing the french ) than to the yellow triangles ( representing the spanish ) . 
  this means the english are genetically closer to the french than to the spanish . 
  this is based on autosomal dna ( x % whg , x % ane , etc. ), 
  rather than y-dna ( r1a , j2 , etc. ), 
  btw . 
  autosomal dna is responsible for making you `` genetically finnish '' and this shows up in your dna as well as physical characteristics . 
  y-dna has pretty much zero effect on how you look and is only used to trace descent and migration patterns . 
  what is fst ? 
  finns are n't even compared with russians there . 
  it says finns are genetically closer to estonians than to swedes so you 're kinda proving my point . 
  my link shows that finns are closer in autosomal dna to russians than to swedes using multiple different dna samples from those people . 
  that 's what matters most . 
  also , many russians are russified finnics so this is n't surprising . 
  you guys both have a high ( by european standards ) east asian dna that scandinavians lack making you guys genetically northeast europeans . 
  they 're hooligans . 
  so they 're just looking for an excuse to fight . 
  [ yes ] ( https://images.nature.com/full/nature-assets/nature/journal/v513/n7518/images_article/nature13673-f2.jpg ) and [ yes ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f-kkqdpqkme/vn2qqupvw8i/aaaaaaaac5a/6nfee9edboo/s1600/haakpca.png ) . 
  move north-center a little to the left so that all of norway falls inside it . 
  it 's interesting how the two richest countries in western europe are not part of the eu . 
  you can be both northern and eastern geographically , it 's called northeastern . 
  in all seriousness though , finns are genetically closer to russians than to scandinavians . 
  calling them eastern europe would insult them . 
  i 've seen it done many times on forums . 
  how big of an issue is it ? 
  i heard they were a model minority in czechia . 
  what are some of their policy position, 
  if kaliningrad was given to lithuania , i ca n't imagine it being colonized by russians . 
  imo , then had it been given to the lithuanian ssr , then it would have been lithuanified . 
  i ca n't believe that `` country '' has nukes ... 
  nova scotia was a british colony not a scottish one . 
  it 's just named after scotland . 
  btw , burma is sometimes referred to as a scottish colony cause of the disproportionate influence scotsmen ( e.g. 
  sir james scott , irrawaddy flotilla company ) had in colonizing it . 
  how come the ussr did n't give it to the lithuanian ssr ? 
  they gave crimea to the ukrainian ssr . 
  lithuania has a higher suicide and alcoholism rate tha latvia , but latvia 's rate is still fairly high on a global ( or even european ) scale . 
  interesting . 
  so i guess this means that the native names of latvia/lithuania come from livonia rather than a proto-baltic root ? 
  also , proto-slavs originated in the pripyat marshes along the belarus-ukraine border . 
  since balts live well north of that , i 'm guessing proto-balts originated in modern day belarus ? 
  is n't the netherlands culturally much closer to germany than to france ? 
  because then it would be hard to argue against classifying slovenia as a balkan country . 
  proof god is a serb :p, 
  fixed . 
  the baltic countries are in alphabetical order from north to south . 
  * oldest flag after denmark . 
  * ex-communist . 
  * sided with the nazis against the soviets . 
  * favorite sport is ice hockey and second favorite sport is basketball . 
  for lithuania , it 's the other way around . 
  they have a friendly sports rivalry . 
  * five main baltic tribes lived there - semigalls/semigallians , cours , latgales ( latvians ) , livs/livonians and sels/selonians . 
  * curonia and semigallia united to form the duchy of courland and semigallia which was a plc vassal state . 
  * the dcs was then annexed by russia . 
  * have a significant russian minority from the soviet era . 
  * called * lettland * in english . 
  and the people were called * lett . 
  * claim continuity from the latgale people . 
  * culturally assimilated the other baltic tribes with the most recent one being the livs/livonians . 
  * in polish , latvia is called * \u0141otwa * ( pronounced `` wotva '' ) and lithuania is called * litwa * ( pronounced litva ) . 
  these names seem to be close to identical with the main difference being one consonant and a morphed `` l sound '' that transformed into a `` w sound '' in the case of * \u0141otwa * . 
  in german , they are * lett * and * lit ( auish ) * which are also almost identical with just one consonant difference ( lit vs. let ) . 
  it 's also likely lithuania was called * litland * or * litwaland * in archaic english since * lithuania * is the latin name . 
  the native names are * latvija * and * lietuvos * which sound close to identical , especially if you take into account the * - ija * suffix is from latin . 
  also , the letts/latgales ( latvians ) and lithuans have always bordered each other since ancient times ( the livs bordered the latgales and have a similar sounding name to * latvia * ) . 
  this suggests to me that they have a relatively recent common origin and in the late bc era , they were probably one people ( along with the livs ) and/or that the proto-baltic name for baltic peoples probably sounded similar to let/lit . 
  i am curious what political events caused such a split though since it seems to not happened so long ago . 
  * one of the last people in europe to convert to christianity . 
  * speak a baltic language . 
  * capital is riga . 
  * high suicide rate . 
  * high alcoholism rate . 
  * had some tiny colonies in the caribbean . 
  the galicians are n't celts anymore . 
  if you wan na call the galicians celts ; then you might as well do the same for the rest of iberia , england , france , and most of central europe . 
  * capital is madrid . 
  * five main languages : catalan ( catalonia , valencia , balearic islands ) , asturian ( asturias , leon ) , aragonese ( aragon ) , basque ( basque country , navarre ) , galician ( galicia ) , castilian ( rest of the country ) . 
  then there is also occitan which is spoken in aran . 
  most of the regions i mentioned predominantly speak castilian as a first language even if that was n't the case originally e.g. 
  only a tiny minority of aragon is aragonese-speaking . 
  * there are 17 autonomous regions and two autonomous cities ( ceuta , melilla ) in africa . 
  * the kingdom of spain was created after the dynastic unification between the crown of castile and the crown of aragon .
