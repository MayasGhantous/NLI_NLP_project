  before this , spain and iberia were considered synonyms . 
  * the crown of aragon was created after the dynastic unification between the kingdom of aragon and county of barcelona . 
  * the crown of aragon conquered sardinia in the past which is why there are catalan speakers on that island . 
  * most of iberia was ruled by moors ( muslims ) for hundreds of years . 
  the first muslim territory in spain was the emirate of cordoba . 
  two big ruling dynasties in al-andalus ( muslim iberia ) were the al-moravids and the al-mohads . 
  * the moors conquered iberia from the vandals . 
  * most muslim iberians were native iberians not arab/berber migrants . 
  after centuries of muslim rule , iberian christians from northern iberia won back iberia from them in the * reconquista * ( with the help of charles martel iirc ) . 
  they told the muslims to leave or convert to christianity . 
  the ones that converted to christianity were called the moriscos ( many of whom were only nominally christian and followed islam secretly ) . 
  many jews also converted to christianity to avoid persecution . 
  they were together referred to as ` new christians ' whereas the iberians that converted to christianity from islam/judaism ( as well as their descendants ) were referred to as ` old christians ' . 
  they were treated differently legally and faced discrimination . 
  there were two major morisco revolts in alpujarras . 
  after the second revolt , almost all moriscos were expelled from spain . 
  * ruled by the hapsburgs . 
  the last hapsburg ruler of spain was a very inbred mentally and physically disabled impotent man called charles ii of spain . 
  spain lost a war during his reign to the french . 
  he was a highly religious man that executed many people for being heretics/apostates , the most by any ruler of spain . 
  he could n't produce any children so left no heir and his death thus ended the hapsburg dynasty 's rule of spain and triggered the war of the spanish succession where spain lost a lot of territory . 
  * spain conquered most of the americas . 
  they discovered the americas via christopher columbus ( who was trying to go to india but went to the caribbean by accident ) . 
  * a lot of rebellions started in the americas after the bourbon reforms . 
  this was when the french house of bourbon took control in spain and started to heavily exploit spanish america to the benefit of spain . 
  * hernan cortes conquered the aztecs and fransisco pizarro conquered the incans . 
  * spain also conquered most of the philippines . 
  the spanish conquered visayas and luzon but were not able to conquer mindanao despite many attempts . 
  they conquered a small part of mindanao called zamboanga but could n't conquer the rest ( zamboanga speaks a spanish creole nowadays ) . 
  they forced luzon and visayas to convert to christianity but mindanao ( sultunate of sulu , sultunate of maguindanao ) remained muslim and animist . 
  mindanao was only conquered later by the us after the us violated the bates treaty i.e. 
  invaded mindanao illegally and then flooded it with christian colonialists from visayas ( who had christian death squads called ilagas ) . 
  * kingdom of spain -  first spanish republic -  kingdom of spain -  second spanish republic -  kingdom of spain ( francoist era and non-francoist era ) . 
  * the carlist wars happened . 
  they were a series of wars between the carlists ( christianists ) and the liberals ( secularists ) . 
  a lot of basque and catalan nationalists were carlists . 
  these ended when franco and his supporters defeated the republicans in the spanish civil war . 
  * many catalan and basque separatists there . 
  some galician ones too . 
  * catalonia is going to have an independence referendum on october first later this year . 
  spain says that doing so is illegal and against the constitution so if catalonia votes yes , spain wo n't just allow it . 
  * the pre-roman language families of spain were iberian , celtic ( indo-european ) , tartessian , and aquitanian . 
  basque is descended from aquitanian . 
  the others are extinct . 
  * hispania was the roman name of iberia . 
  * the ` gal ' in ** gal ** icia and portu ** gal ** are celtic-derivedd related to the terms celtic , gaelic , gaul , etc. 
  * the name of the cantabrians , asturians , and galicians are pre-roman . 
  do any spanish nationalists in galicia get really triggered by galicians celebrating this ? 
  are there any arguments over celebrating this in galicia ? 
  i assume some spanish nationalists in other parts of spain would make a fuss over this , but i 'm asking specifically about galicia . 
  less than england i 'd say . 
  even some in anatolia . 
  they originated in hallstatt , austria . 
  they are n't anymore celtic than the english are really . 
  people in the balkans ( especially bulgaria ) also play bagpipes . 
  [ great finnish folk song . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nognv13ta-a ), 
  probably as a loanword from some european language like french or spanish . 
  the name * alman * comes from the * alemmani * ( german subgroup ) that live in switzerland , liechtenstein , and southwest germany . 
  the kingdom of poland portion of the plc is bigger than it used to be though . 
   `` jewish '' goes with `` arab ~ ~ muslim ~ ~ '' . 
  spoiler alert , not everyone can become arab  ftfy . 
  arab is the ethnic group , not arab muslim . 
  it did remove all jewish settlements in the gaza strip . 
  do you know what the gaza strip then turned into ? 
  basically a hamas haven with tunnels everywhere being used to attempt to launch rockets at israel . 
  i 'm sure you have n't forgotten about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_israel%e2%80%93gaza_conflict ) . 
  palestinian and jewish are not proper equivalents . 
  just like anyone can be palestinian , anyone can be israeli . 
  jewish is an ethnicity like arab , not palestinian . 
  a lot of people also sacrificed themselves to defend communism and fascism . 
  should those societies have just stayed communist/fascist ? 
  what sacrifices people made are irrelevant . 
  the only point of relevance is whether free speech should be necessary or not based on principal rather than based on historical reasons . 
  nobody is indebted to the state 's laws based on what soldiers did in the past . 
   a lot of soldiers died so that free speech exist . 
  a lot of soldiers also died to protect the monarchy and many archaic ideals . 
  that is completely irrelevant . 
  i do n't think the rest of your argument is flawed , but this part is irrelevant . 
  so what 's the point of elections then if you do n't think the victors should be able to execute stuff like this ? 
   fuck listening to the citizens , right ? 
  do the people of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland want this ? 
  they voted in the tories . 
  now the tories get to do this . 
  tough luck . 
  maybe this will cause them to vote labour next time . 
   so imposing restrictions that will not at all stop access from anyone , nor even their targets ( because , guess what , they are incredibly basic and easy to contour ) is the way to go ? 
  instead of educating the targeted over why they should n't watch porn ( which i think it 's a bit of a tired shitty debate ) as well as their parents to be responsible and guarantee a safer environment ... nope !, 
  let 's make the internet shittier for every single paying uk resident !, 
  i did n't say i supported the restrictions either , just that imposing restrictions is better than banning porn . 
  i personally think we should educate people instead . 
  here 's what i wrote : * but i think we should instead work to talk about the harms of porn and discourage people from watching it in their adolescence * . 
   who in the uk actually asked for this ? 
  the government ? 
   no , though my neighbor did ( for 4 years ) and he was pretty much informed over it ( as you 'd probably guess a belgian very used to porn would be ) . 
  i 've asked about him , and he showed me how it all worked . 
  i visited pakistan before and all porn was banned there . 
  even western porn from obscure sites . 
   imposing restrictions is now a good thing ? 
  what 's next ?
