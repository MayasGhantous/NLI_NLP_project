  worked wonders last time . 
  i was n't necessarily agreeing with those restrictions , just speaking from their pov . 
  i have mixed feelings about this . 
  while i 'm against porn , i do n't think that banning it is necessary . 
  imposing restrictions may be better than banning it , but i think we should instead work to talk about the harms of porn and discourage people from watching it in their adolescence . 
  in american pronunciation too . 
   the ksa banned the biggest ones over there and suddenly as they 've done so traffic towards other western and far-eastern websites has grown ... makes you think does n't it ? 
  where did you hear this ? 
  did you live there ? 
  i 'm sure all porn would be banned there . 
   porn flows even with these restrictions put in place ; and not only that there 's even tonnes of porn coming from places who banned it . 
  that may be kinda true , but those restrictions at least make porn harder to access . 
  so better than nothing . 
  yes , a lot of websites like vk wo n't be covered . 
  it 's impossible to do 100 % , but i think the uk will see it as an accomplishment if it can do it to most porn sites . 
  how has ksa not managed to ban the biggest porn websites ? 
  okay , thanks . 
  what do you mean by soft consonants ? 
  do you think < \u0429 \u0449  should be represented as < \u0160\u010d \u0161\u010d  or < \u015e \u015f  in latin ? 
  well , there are multiple countries that have banned porn and they have banned virtually every single porn site , even the obscure ones . 
  the only way to access them is vpn . 
  and they do n't make the mistake of banning american pie or whatever other examples you were using . 
  so whatever those countries did , the uk will try to do as well ( except instead of banning they will put age restrictions ) . 
  i assume the biggest porn sites with cooperate with the uk on the restrictions whereas the uk wo n't be assed to try to get all the smaller porn websites to put up uk-specific restrictions . 
  but i 'm not entirely sure how that would work . 
  i do n't have a clear cut definition of porn , but when you see a website , it is obvious whether that website is a porn website or just a regular website that may have a nipple in it . 
  the british government will see these websites on a case by case basis most likely and only target the biggest websites . 
   indeed , though iirc they 're being aggressively converted by orthodox priests . 
  it 's a shame , i 'd rather that the country secularize than do this . 
  [ how accurate is this article ? 
  ] ( http://journeytoorthodoxy.com/2013/09/mysterious-mass-conversion-from-islam-to-christianity-in-georgia/ ), 
  if it 's a website dedicated to * videos * about nudity , then it 's porn . 
  if it 's anything else , then it 's a gray area . 
  either way , the british government is gon na put restrictions on only the top porn sites . 
  it 's not gon na put restrictions on all the literal thousands of porn sites . 
  porn website = website whose main function is to host porn videos . 
  are old great bulgaria and khazaria the same thing ? 
  they seem to be in the same location and the khazars are also rumored to be oghur turks . 
  a site that hosts mainly porn content . 
  vk does n't do that . 
  i think it 's obvious when a website is a porn website . 
  reddit is not one . 
  for the proposed latin alphabet for ukrainian , it looks good , but there are some things i feel they did wrong : * for the cyrillic < \u0425 \u0445  , they should use < x x  in latin rather than < kh kh  . 
  * for the cyrillic < \u0426 \u0446  , they should use < c c  in latin rather than < ts ts  . 
  * for the cyrillic < \u0427 \u0447  , they should use < \u010c \u010d  in latin rather than < ch ch  . 
  * for the cyrillic < \u0428 \u0448  , they should use < \u0160 \u0161  in latin rather than < sh sh  . 
  * for the cyrillic < \u0429 \u0449  , they should use < \u0160\u010d \u0161\u010d  or < \u015e \u015f  in latin rather than < shch shch  . 
   using just english alphabet and ignoring sounds that do n't exist there . 
  softness/palatalization of consonants is absolutely ignored . 
  can you give some examples ? 
  would the < a  in t ** a ** ll be a long vowel ? 
  what guy is the op talking about ? 
  he deleted his post . 
   the russian government calls them that as part of suppressing their cultural identity . 
  tatars themselves use the term now . 
  in the past , they just called themselves `` muslim '' . 
  then the russians gave them the name `` tatar '' and it has stuck . 
   north dobruja was never part of the modern bulgarian state . 
  but it was part of bulgaria before wallachia conquered it . 
   buglaria 1st lost that territory when conquered by the eastern roman empire . 
  of course , it also used to be romaion territory before it even became bulgarian . 
  was it slavic/bulgarian-speaking when the eastern roman empire conquered it ? 
   commies and their stooges are still in power . 
  the current pm served in the state security and was later a bodyguard for todor zhivkov ( the former communist dictator ) . 
  do they have any communist policies ? 
   the cyrillic aplhabet was developed by their students in bulgaria , but cyril and methodius were ( most likely ) not bulgarian . 
  were they most likely greek ? 
   but the bgn is pegged to the eur ( it used to be pegged to the dm ) what 's the dm ? 
  why does n't bulgaria start using the euro ? 
   bulgarians have shake their heads when they want to say yes . 
  is this only bulgarians or do people from any other balkan countries do this as well ? 
   what counts as porn for this system though ? 
  they are applying this procedure to * porn websites * . 
   point number 4 ... why should we prevent our children to see porn if they are actively looking for it ?

  * the bulgarians get their name from the volga bulgars , who were oghur-speakers . 
  the only remaining oghur language is chuvash but the chuvash are said to be oghurified/chuvashified maris and the volga tatars are said to be kipchakified bulgars/chuvashes . 
  the chuvash are called * suas * in the mari language but after some maris adopted the chuvash language/identity , they started referring to the chuvash as * suasenmari * ( `` chuvashified mari '' ) . 
  the volga tatars are of chuvash ( bulgar ) origin but got kipchakified after the golden horde conquered them . 
  the volga tatars stopped calling themselves ` bulgar ' after they got islmacized/kipchakified and started referring to themselves as generic `` muslim '' . 
  they call themselves tatars nowadays cause that was the name russians gave them . 
  * ohrid ( city in modern day fyr macedonia ) was the capital of the first bulgarian empire . 
  * bulgaria was thracian before it got conquered by the bulgars . 
  * north dobruja was originally part of bulgaria but then got conquered by romania . 
  * bulgaria has many turkics ( turkish , crimean tatars ) . 
  the crimean tatars are descended from refugees and mainly live in dobruja ( including romanian dobruja ) and the turkish mainly live in kardzhali ( as well as other eastern provinces to a lesser degree ) . 
  * capital is sofia . 
  * bulgaria first lost contemporary fyr macedonia after stefan dushan defeated them in the battle of velbazhd . 
  but they did n't detach themselves from the bulgarian ethnic identity until after ww2 ( not 100 % sure on this part ) . 
  * the second bulgarian empire got conquered by the ottomans and then become partially independent in the early 20th century . 
  it became fully independent as the kingdom of bulgaria after winning the first balkan war against the ottomans . 
  * started the second balkan war because they wanted fyr macedonia but lost a lot of territory there . 
  they tried to reclaim that territory in ww2 but failed .

  * there is a region in bulgaria unofficially called pirin macedonia , but the people from there do n't call themselves macedonians . 
  * bulgarian and slavic-macedonian are mutually intelligible . 
  * they use the lev instead of the euro . 
  north european isles includes iceland which is n't part of the archipelago that includes gb and ireland .
