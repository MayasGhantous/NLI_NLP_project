  so technically , belarus means `` north russia '' if that 's the case here . ~ ~ white russia is a name given by western europeans and it meant `` east '' so it was used to refer to the eastern part of rus ' . 
  * rus ' ( east slavic ) people were originally one ethnic group but then split when the gdl conquered the principality of kiev ( western rus ' ) from rus ' after the golden horde ( mongol ) invasion of rus ' . 
  they defeated the golden horde in the battle of blue waters to conquer the principality of kiev ( a lot of which became under muscovite control later after the muscovites won the muscovite-lithuanian wars ) . 
  the western rus ' people were called ruthenians ( exonym ) in latin and were considered one ethnic group for a while before splitting into ukrainians ( southern ruthenians ) and belorussians ( northern ruthenians ) as one was more lithuanian influenced ( belarus ) and the other was more independent/polish influenced ( ukraine ) . 
  * the west polesian dialect/language serves as a dialect continuum connecting the belorussian and ukrainian languages . 
  * minsk is it 's capital . 
  * the last unofficial dictatorship in europe . 
  * belorussian is a language descended from old east slavic . 
  ukrainian is the closet related language to it , followed by russian . 
  * most belorussians ( 90 % + ) ca n't speak belorussian , but speak russian instead . 
  * the belorussian language was developed in the late 15th century . 
  * lukashenko is not as much of a russian puppet as westerners may think . 
  russia and belarus had energy wars ( over oil and gas prices ) in 2004 and 2007 in addition to a milk war in 2009 where all dairy products coming from russia were banned in belarus . 
  lukashenko also started promoting the belorussian language recently to deter russian influence a bit . 
  * the pripyat marshes along the belarus-ukraine border is where proto-slavs originated . 
  * the neuri ( who might have been proto-balto-slavs ) are from there as well . 
  * belarus was properly integrated into the grand duchy of lithuania before it joined the kingdom of poland to form the plc. 
  when the teutonic knights conquered samogitia , belarus ( and a large portion of ukraine ) was the only remaining region controlled by gd lithuania . 
  ~ ~ gediminas was the lithuanian duke that conquered belarus . ~ ~ * some ( a small minority ) of them claim lithuanian history and identity as their own ( i.e. 
  calling themselves `` litvin '' ) . 
  they call the lithuanians `` samogitians '' . 
  * belarus got conquered by the russian empire and then continued being part of russia when russia changed it 's name to the soviet union after the bolshevik revolution . 
  it was called the belorussian soviet socialist republic when part of the ussr . 
  it then became it 's own country for the first time ever when it gained independence in 1991 . 
  tiny portions of azerbaijan and georgia are geographically part of europe . 
  however , 0 % of armenia is geographically in europe . 
  these are all the non-langues d'o\u00efl and non-occitan languages of france . 
  the map is missing norman , picard , gascon , etc. 
  which will all probably be extinct very soon . 
  * two main albanian subgroups/dialects : ghegs ( northerners ) and tosks ( southerners ) . 
  * outside of albania , albanians are also the majority in kosovo and western fyr macedonia . 
  pockets of albanians live in greece & italy and a small minority live in serbia & montenegro as well . 
  * the albanians living in italy are called * arbereshe * ( old name of albanians ) , the ones living in epirus ( chameria ) are called chams , and the ones living in south greece are called arvanites . 
  they are all tosks . 
  the ones living in montenegro and western fyr macedonia are ghegs . 
  * tosks tend to be orthodox and muslim whereas ghegs tend to be catholic and muslim . 
  * the arbereshe are descended from albanian refugees that fled the ottoman invasion of albania in the 1600 's . 
  they get their name from albania 's old name * arberia * which got replaced by * shqiperia * in the 18th century . 
  the arvanites also called themselves arbereshe , arvanite is just their greek name . 
  * george kastrioti skanderbeg is their national hero cause of his rebellions against the ottomans . 
  * they are descended from illyrians and speak the illyrian language . 
  albanians , along with the greeks , are the only people in southeast europe to retain their language from pre-roman times . 
  all other se euros either got romanized/latinized or slavicized . 
  * mother teresa was albanian . 
  * most people from both kosovo and albania want kosovo to be annexed to albania , but it will be seen as albanian aggression so they do n't talk about doing it . 
  * most albanians are muslim , but albanians are very secular people . 
  a lot of albanians are also bektashi , a variant of shia islam unique to albania that was introduced by the ottomans . 
  most are sunni though . 
  * most albanians converted to islam to avoid paying jizya and get privilege from the ottomans . 
  many also served in the ottoman armies . 
  * they think greece has too much influence over orthodoxy in albania cause the head of albania 's autocephalous orthodox church is an ethnic greek . 
  * it was the last country in the balkans to gain independence from the ottomans , gaining independence after the second balkan war . 
  * an ethnic albanian named muhammad ali pasha , who served as ottoman commander , ruled egypt and sudan . 
  * more albanians live outside albania than inside albania . 
  germans voted for the cdu under the impression that the cdu will keep gay marriage illegal . 
  so this is undemocratic . 
  the people of germany did not vote for this . 
  just checked your post history . 
  you 're indian so that explains it . 
  why do you use duckduckgo ? 
  i 've never heard of anybody ever using that . 
  * supposed to be pronounced with a / k / rather than a / s / but is only pronounced with a / s / sound cause of the english spelling/pronunciation rules . 
  similar to macedonia being pronounced as masedonia when it should be pronounced makedonia , just english spelling rules . 
  the reason cyprus is spelled with a < c  rather than a < k  is cause it was spelled that way when it was loaned from latin . 
  * the pre-greek language of cyprus is called eteocypriot ( likely a semitic language ) . 
  * aphrodite ( who is actually of west asian origin ) was born there according to greek mythology . 
  * the northern half is de facto a separate country but the turkish republic of northern cyprus is n't recognized by anyone other than turkey . 
  * the capital ( nicosia ) is divided between northern cyprus and the republic of cyprus . 
  * northern cyprus used to be greek majority but is turkish majority cause turkey invaded it and sent in many turkish settlers . 
  * only country besides kosovo to have a map on it 's flag . 
  * was part of the british empire before for a short while . 
  the brits won it from the ottomans . 
  they have two military bases there currently . 
  * proposed union with greece is called * enosis * . 
  * most greeks in the uk are cypriots i heard . 
  * geographically part of asia but since it 's greek majority ( and greeks are euros ) , it 's considered europe . 
  here are screenshots of it when i am logged out : [ link ] ( https://imgur.com/a/lob7v ) my post is nowhere to be found there . 
  i just checked this page on incognito and my comment was not approved . 
   but can you see how it makes sense to teach kids about the existence of different sexualities . 
   i would imagine it would help kid comes to terms with their sexuality . 
  sexuality is a pseudoscience . 
   like if you are a gay kid and you are tips from a young age that some men like women and some like men and others like both . 
  you do n't think that would put your mind at ease . 
  if i thought that they born like that , do you think i would be having the views that i have ? 
  gay sex is simply an action like masturbation and the gay identity is an artificial modern western liberal construction . 
  being addicted to gay sex is like being addicted to weed . 
  it is not a sexuality or fixed inborn identity . 
   now if you are against lgbt people so much you wo n't allow kids to learn about something that might be about them . 
  then i do n't know what to tell you . 
  it wo n't be about them if they are raised normally . 
  among animals , exclusive attraction to the same sex does not exist . 
  gay sex is simply an individual act like masturbation . 
  the gay identity was invented in 1862 by a man who became gay as the result of child rape . 
  gays become the way they are because of various factors such as childhood rape , abuse , negative experience with the opposite sex , hyper porn addiction , media brainwashing , etc. 
  in societies such as the netherlands and sweden where they are accepted as equal and normal , they have a substantially higher mental illness rate than straight people . 
  do any non-lgbt minorities have such a high mental illness rate anywhere ? 
  sexuality is a pseudoscience . 
  i explained [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6jrmdt/after_merkels_surprising_statements_on_gay/djh2qgb/ ) how the concept of the homosexual identity came into existence ( i can go into more detail but that 's just the tip of the iceberg on the origins of the identity ) . 
  it is simply an artificial late 19th century identity based on a capricious desire . 
  it would be similar to cuckolds stating they were born this way and then asking for civil rights based on their capricious desire and having their lifestyle taught to little kids in school and promoted as normal .
