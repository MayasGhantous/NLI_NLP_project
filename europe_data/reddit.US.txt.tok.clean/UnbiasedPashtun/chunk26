  you are desensitized so you think this is normal , but it really is n't . 
  and impressionable children ( especially innocent 5 year olds ) should not be exposed to this at a young age . 
  i 'm not `` served '' anything . 
  if anything , i do the serving myself to other people . 
  i 'm not obsessed . 
  most of my comments came this month cause a lot of lgbt threads started popping up this month since it 's apparently pride month or something . 
  i only comment anti-lgbt stuff on articles like this . 
  over 95 % of my posts on this sub have nothing to do with lgbts and i post here almost every day . 
  i replied to you but for some reason , it wo n't show up ( maybe mods are censoring it ? 
  idk ) . 
  so i sent you a pm refuting all of that . 
  anybody that is curious to what i replied can just check my post history . 
  why the heck did you ask me why i opposed it then ? 
  you ca n't refute a single thing so you 're just running away with your tail between your legs . 
  this is how you argue with people . 
  typical pro-gay argument . 
  just laugh or call names . 
  no refutation whatsoever  you remind me of [ this woman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akojlfg3zpc ) . 
  okay , i just meant that when debating this topic , you do n't have to say `` i am only against this solely because my religion tells me '' . 
  it sounded like that was your reasoning at least . 
  because when saying that , people will think you are trying to force your religion on everybody . 
  so i was just saying that when speaking to pro-gay people , it is better to tell them that you are against this for secular/moral reasons . 
  you also said this :  church is seperate from state and therefore it does n't have to change i do n't think we should * only * look at the church vs. state issue in these kinds of debates . 
  * they are correlated with a high mental illness rate . 
  * they have a higher stds rate . 
  * they have a higher pedophilia rate . 
  * they ( people that claim to have an inborn exclusive homosexual identity ) are a recent artificial western invention and not natural . 
  * they lower the birth rate . 
  * they recruit more people into their lifestyle by promoting it as normal to kids at a young age thus increasing the rate of all of the above . 
  i mentioned vietnam and china because the people there are against homosexuality for non-religious reasons . 
  people in sweden and norway support homosexuality so it makes no sense to mention them . 
  when i went to school here in new york in the 2000 's -2010 's , we were never taught about lgbts . 
  we were only taught stuff about safe sex practices ( stds , condoms , etc ) . 
  lgbts were never mentioned once . 
  including them in the curriculum seems to be a more recent thing . 
  you do n't have to use religious reasoning to be against this . 
  the reason why it was originally forbidden in certain religions was because of the morals of the time . 
  those morals can arguably still be applied today . 
  i am for separation of church and state , but i am against this . 
  even atheist countries like china ( prc ) and vietnam would never entertain such a fact . 
  you can be against lgbt stuff for entirely secular reasons . 
  western atheists have hijacked this topic by transforming it into a religion vs. secular issue when it 's a moral issue . 
  the fact that more catholic spaniards support gay marriage than vietnamese atheists says it right there . 
  to those that did n't like my comment and think that homosexuality ( inborn fixed attraction exclusively towards the same sex ) is not something that was invented recently by western liberals , here is a list of quotes ( some/all ? 
  of these quotes are by gays themselves ) and they are cited : * in short , the gay lifestyle - if such a chaos can , after all , legitimately be called a lifestyle - ** it just does n't work : it does n't serve the two functions for which all social framework evolve : to constrain people 's natural impulses to behave badly and to meet their natural needs . 
  ** while it 's impossible to provide an exhaustive analytic list of all the root causes and aggravants of this failure , we can asseverate at least some of the major causes . 
  many have been dissected , above , as elements of the ten misbehaviors ; it only remains to discuss the failure of the gay community to provide a viable alternative to the heterosexual family . 
  ( kirk and madsen , after the ball : how america will conquer its fear and hatred of the gays in the 90s , p. 363 ) * not all societies have a culture of sexual identity . 
  ** in truth , the notion that individuals define themselves by their sexual desire or behavior is a rather exceptional social occurrence . 
  ** ( pennington and sojika , the revolt against sexual identity , p. 81 in the social construction of sexuality by steven seidman ) * no matter how much identities provide an anchor for us and a basis for group formation , they control us , tell us how to be , and force us to repudiate aspects of ourselves . 
  ( pennington and sojika , the revolt against sexual identity , p. 86 in the social construction of sexuality by steven seidman ) * homosexuality today expressed in a gay and lesbian identity may possibly be viewed as another model of homosexuality . 
  just as the others are historically and culturally specific so is the modern gay and lesbian . 
  being a gay and lesbian is not a unitary construct that is culturally transcendent across all societies today . 
  ** a gay and lesbian is a social political identity limited to modern western cultures , although this gay and lesbian identity is gradually being expressed and adopted in other parts of the world . 
  ** in this article it is the united states that is the specific emphasis . 
  there may be references and quotes refereeing to other english speaking countries . 
  but as seen in the above quotes there are already modern day challenges to a gay and lesbian political identity . 
  * lesbian and gay historians have asked questions about the origins of gay liberation and lesbian feminism , and have come up with some surprising answers . 
  rather than finding a silent , oppressed , gay minority in all times and all places , ** historians have discovered that gay identity is a recent , western , historical construction ** . 
  jeffrey weeks , jonathan katz and lillian faderman , for example have traced the emergence of lesbian and gay identity in the late nineteenth century . 
  similarly john demilio , allan berube and the buffalo oral history project have described how this identity laid the basis for organized political activity in the years following world war ii . 
  * the work of ** lesbian and gay historians has also demonstrated that human sexuality is not a natural , timeless given , but is historically shaped and politically regulated ** . 
  ( duggan , history 's gay ghetto : the contradictions of growth in lesbian and gay history , p.151-152 in sex wars edited by duggan & hunter , sex wars ) * it is n't at all obvious why a gay rights movement should ever have arisen in the united states in the first place . 
  and it 's profoundly puzzling why that movement should have become far and away the most powerful such political formation in the world . 
  same gender sexual acts have been commonplace throughout history and across cultures . 
  today , to speak with surety about a matter for which there is absolutely no statistical evidence , more adolescent male butts are being penetrated in the arab world , latin american , north africa and southeast asia then in the west . 
  but the notion of a gay identity rarely accompanies such sexual acts , nor do political movements arise to make demands in the name of that identity . 
  ** it 's still almost entirely in the western world that the genders of one 's partner is considered a prime marker of personality ** and among western nations it is the united states - a country otherwise considered a bastion of conservatism - that the strongest political movement has arisen centered around that identity . 
  we 've only begun to analyze why , and to date can say little more then that ** certain significant pre-requisites developed in this country , and to some degree everywhere in the western world , that were n't present , or had n't achieved the necessary critical mass , elsewhere ** . 
  among such factors were the weakening of the traditional religious link between sexuality and procreation ( one which had made non-procreative same gender desire an automatic candidate for denunciation as unnatural ) . 
  secondly the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the united states , and the west in general , in the nineteen-century weakened the material ( and moral ) authority of the nuclear family , and allowed mavericks to escape into welcome anonymity of city life , where they could choose a previously unacceptable lifestyle of singleness and nonconformity without constantly worrying about parental or village busybodies pouncing on them . 
  ( duberman , left out , p. 414 - 415 . ), 
  * psychological theory , which should be employed to describe only individual mental , emotional , and behavioral aspects of homosexuality , has been employed for building models of personal development that purport to mark the steps in an individual 's progression toward a mature and egosyntonic gay or lesbian identity . 
  ** the embracing and disclosing of such an identity , however , is best understood as a political phenomenon occurring in a historical period during which identity politics has become a become a consuming occupation . 
  ** ( de cecco , sex , cells , and same-sex desire : the biology of sexual , preference p. 21 ), 
  i 'm not against teaching teenagers about using condoms and the dangers of stds . 
  i am against teaching 5 year old children about lgbts . 
  i meant to say teaching * about * homosexuality . 
  edited my response above . 
  and that can be done by having the teachers give pro-gay lectures and show pro-gay videos . 
  gayness should n't be mentioned in classrooms at all , period ( if you think sexuality should be a private matter that is ) . 
  the homosexual identity was invented in 1862 by karl heinrich ulrichs . 
  he claimed he was born gay ( although he became gay after being molested by his 30 year old riding instructor at the age of 14 ) . 
  he said he was born that way so that people that wanted to have sex with the same sex could get civil rights by appealing paragraph 175 of the german penal code . 
  before that , the concept of a gay identity did not exist . 
  there are 0 records of anyone in the entire history of mankind identifying as gay or claiming exclusive attraction to the same sex . 
  there was no word for homosexual in any language before he coined the term ` uranian ' ( which he considered a third gender ) in 1862 . 
  although he claimed that uranian men were people with male bodies and a female spirit . 
  the term homosexual was then invented in 1869 by a german-hungarian follower of his who went by the pen name karoly-maria kertbeny ( his real name was karoly-maria benkert ) . 
  the homosexual identity is a completely modern invention that did not exist historically . 
  before that , gay sex was just considered an individual act ( which was almost exclusively pederastic btw ) like how masturbation is considered an individual act . 
  there are still a few societies in tribal africa where both gay sex and masturbation are completely non-existent . 
  no gay marriage ever occurred in any society in pre-modern times . 
   we mostly just tend to be ** very private about things like ** religious beliefs or ** sex life ** compared to most , at least that 's what i 've found . 
  yet you guys teach kids about homosexuality in school ... 
  and strangely enough , germany invented the homosexual identity but are one of the last western countries to recognize same sex marriage . 
  just get anschlussed and you wo n't be behind germany anymore :p, 
  nah , i just found this on google . 
  what do you think of belta ? 
  it is banned .
