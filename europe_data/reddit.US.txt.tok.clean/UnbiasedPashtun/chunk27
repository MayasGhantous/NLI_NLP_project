  it was banned since 2014 and this is n't the first time the turkish police had to settle things . 
  but it seems that lgbts think that they 're above the law . 
  why ? 
  fyromian and slav-macedonian are unofficially used as well . 
  hope turks rise up against him soon before he turns into an islamist version of assad : /, 
  good job turkey . 
  yes it is , but it is not christian . 
  why are we comparing the netherlands to finland on this sub so much ? 
  compare it to germany or sweden instead . 
  the netherlands and finland are not that culturally connected and this just feels like some sort of meme people are trying to force . 
  same to you !, 
  okay , thanks a lot for all that info , i saved your post  that really clears up everything , especially her attitude towards women . 
  i was not aware she had an affair with a guy before . 
  my long post would n't get approved . 
  check my comment history for it . 
  it basically starts out with me asking you if you live in russia and then explaining the history of homosexuality and why it is n't inborn . 
   nobody actually knows how they became gay . 
  not `` nobody '' . 
  many people do . 
   sure plenty of gay people believe that something happened to make them that way , but the vast majority say that once they reached puberty they realised they were gay and that was that . 
  many also report having those feelings as a child but not really understanding what they meant until they are older . 
  the `` feelings as a child but not understanding what they meant '' are a result of false memories and a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
   at the end of the day , gay people who have a hunch their experiences a play role ca n't really compete with the study that has been done on the matter you mean studies like [ this ] ( https://stream.org/yes-childhood-sexual-abuse-often-contribute-homosexuality/ ) ? 
   ultimately , you are prepared to believe a minority of gay people over the majority as well as experts because it confirms what you would like to believe is the truth . 
  this is n't reasonable thinking homosexuality was considered a mental illness before and only removed cause of gay lobbyists . 
  there is no scientific evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is genetic . 
  it 's just modern western liberal propaganda . 
  it 's the reason why some societies have a radically higher rate of gays than other societies . 
   i 'm gay but was never molested and had a pretty decent upbringing . 
  how did that happen ? 
  a young boy asked martin luther king jr. a similar question . 
  here was his question : * `` i am a boy , but i feel about boys the way i ought to feel about girls . 
  i do n't want my parents to know about me . 
  what can i do ? 
  is there any place where i can go for help ? '' * dr. king responded : * `` your problem is not at all an uncommon one . 
  however , it does require careful attention . 
  the type of feeling that you have toward boys is probably not an innate tendency , but something that has been culturally acquired . 
  * * `` your reasons for adopting this habit have now been consciously suppressed or unconsciously repressed . 
  '' * * `` therefore , it is necessary to deal with this problem by getting back to some of the experiences and circumstances that lead to the habit . 
  '' * * `` in order to do this i would suggest that you see a good psychiatrist who can assist you in bringing to the forefront of conscience all of those experiences and circumstances that lead to the habit . 
  '' * * `` you are already on the right road toward a solution , since you honestly recognise the problem and have a desire to solve it . '' * -- so to answer your question , you became gay because of an event or a series of events that happened . 
  as for what event ( s ) triggered this , you could talk to a psychiatrist on that , but i doubt you would care to ( especially if you 're old ) . 
  anyways , i am no psychiatrist , but i do have an idea on how people become gay , so if you have the patience , answer the following questions : 1 . 
  did you ever face abuse ( not sexual abuse , but abuse in general ) ? 
  at what age did you have your first sexual encounter ? 
  were your parents divorced ? 
  if so , who did you live with ? 
  if not , how often did you see your father ? 
  what gender are your siblings ? 
  at what age did you discover you were gay ? 
  what did your family think about homosexuality ? 
  were you ever bullied a lot growing up ? 
  did you ever experiment with the opposite sex ? 
  if so , why did n't the relationship last ? 
   plus , plenty of heterosexuals got molested and had a terrible time growing up . 
  weird not everybody has the same brain . 
  our sexuality is a result of our emotions . 
  we all think differently . 
  even though many straight people suffer from child abuse , [ a disproportionately higher number of gays and bisexuals do ] ( https://stream.org/yes-childhood-sexual-abuse-often-contribute-homosexuality/ ) . 
   what 's interesting though - is despite your focus on child abuse causing homosexuals , you focus on clamping down on existing homosexuals and not child abuse . 
  huh . 
   you 'd think your main focus would be on the cause of the problem , not the victims of it . 
  i do n't think it 's the only cause of homosexuality , just one of the causes . 
  and obviously i am against child abuse . 
  what am i supposed to say about child abuse ? 
  should i just preach to the choir that pedophilia is a bad thing and should stay illegal ? 
  that does n't make sense . 
  nobody ( at least almost nobody ) thinks pedophilia is a good thing so there is no point in arguing with people that agree with me . 
  though there was a thread before where people were talking about how pedos are born that way and should n't be demonized . 
  i argued that they were n't born that way , so there 's that i guess . 
  thanks for the info , but i 'd like some more clarifications on queen christina as the evidence i have seen seems to very strongly suggest she was n't biologically female . 
  in her paintings ( which were done in the 1600 's ) , she looks kinda intersex : [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/drottning_kristina_av_sverige.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/anselmus-van-hulle-hommes-illustres_mg_0431.tif/lossy-page1-453px-anselmus-van-hulle-hommes-illustres_mg_0431.tif.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/swedish_queen_drottning_kristina_portrait_by_s%c3%a9bastien_bourdon_stor.jpg ) do n't get me wrong , she definitely looks more female than male , but based off a quick glance when i first saw her photo , something felt fishy . 
  here are some quotes from wikipedia ( which are all sourced in the bibliography ) :  historical accounts of christina include regular reference to her ** physical features ** , mannerisms and style of dress . 
  christina was known to have a bent back , a deformed chest , and irregular shoulders . 
   according to christina 's own autobiography , the midwives at her birth first believed her to be a boy because she was ** `` completely hairy and had a coarse and strong voice '' ** . 
   while christina may not have been alone in her own time for choosing masculine dress ( leonora christina ulfeldt , for example , was known for dressing the same way ) , ** she also had physical features some described as masculine ** . 
   according to henry ii , duke of guise , `` she wears men 's shoes and ** her voice ** and nearly all her actions are masculine '' . 
   she is over sixty years of age , very small of stature , exceedingly fat and corpulent . 
  her complexion and ** voice and face are those of a man ** . 
  she has a big nose , large blue eyes , blonde eyebrows , and ** a double chin from which sprout several tufts of beard ** . 
  so not only did she dress and behave like a man , but she also had some male facial features , a non-feminine voice , and a bit of facial hair as well . 
  having * all * these characteristics at once really makes you think . 
  oh , and she also showed no interest in men but wrote passionate letters to a woman . 
  -- anyways , while reading the page , i managed to find exactly what you were referencing   in 1965 these conflicting accounts led to an investigation of christina 's remains . 
  physical anthropologist carl-herman hjortsj\u00f6 , who undertook the investigation , explained : ** `` our imperfect knowledge concerning the effect of intersex on the skeletal formation [ ... ] makes it impossible to decide which positive skeletal findings should be demanded upon which to base the diagnosis '' of an intersex condition . 
  ** nevertheless , hjortsj\u00f6 speculated that christina had reasonably typical female genitalia because it is recorded by her physicians bourdelot and macchiati that she menstruated . 
  [ 152 ] hjortsj\u00f6 's osteological analysis of christina 's skeleton led him to state that they were of a `` typically female '' structure . 
  [ 153 ] now it should be noted that the person investigating admitted that our knowledge on intersex people back in 1965 was fairly obscure . 
  so they could not make a proper diagnosis on her skeletal structure being possible among intersex individuals . 
  he mentions that she had a vagina . 
  yes , this is very common among intersex people . 
  he mentions that she was recorded to have periods . 
  this is not common among intersex people , however [ it does occur ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36092431 ) . 
  here is the explanation given by them :  some of the symptoms could be due to polycystic ovary syndrome , a complex multi-endocrine disorder including hirsutism ( male pattern/type hair growth ) due to increased androgen hormone levels , and abdominal obesity due to the hormone insulin receptor defects . 
  as she had very little comprehension for the need of most social norms and little desire to act , dress , or do other social norms , preferring to wearing , acting , and doing only that which she deemed logically practical , buckley suggested pervasive developmental disorder i.e. , asperger 's syndrome . 
  [ 68 ] [ 154 ] so she definitely was n't the typical female . 
  there seem to be other explanations given regarding her uniqueness . 
  i personally still would n't rule out her being intersex . 
  you said that sven slope helped popularize this idea , but we have accounts of others ( midwife , henry ii ) that comment on her masculinity . 
  so i would n't dismiss the theory based on the fact he wrote about it .
