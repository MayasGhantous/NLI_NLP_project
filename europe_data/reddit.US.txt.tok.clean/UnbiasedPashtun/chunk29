   and i did watch the cringeworthiness of these poor saps . 
  do you think the whole thing was setup to make gay people look bad and that everyone was a paid actor ? 
  let them have gay sex in private without anyone knowing . 
  if we promote it as normal , more and more people are going to become gay and then [ this ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/20-percent-millennials-lgbtq-glaad-study_us_58dd140be4b05eae031d8f9c ) will happen . 
  this too : https://paste bin.com/0jr14jjd ( btw , the link has a few anti-jewish stuff at the very end which you should ignore ) ( remove the space between ` paste ' and ` bin ' and put that into your url ), 
  i would say lgbt would be considered universally harmful because : 1 . 
  it has proven harmful effects : https://paste bin.com/0jr14jjd ( btw , the link has a few anti-jewish stuff at the very end which you should ignore ) ( remove the space between ` paste ' and ` bin ' and put that into your url to see the link ) 2 . 
  homosexuality is a completely modern concept with no historical basis prior to the late 19th century i.e. 
  it 's an artificial invention of modern western liberals . 
  they say they are born that way , which is a lie . 
  thus , promoting their lifestyle is both deceptive and wrong . 
  since the natural function of a relationship is to procreate , being homosexual goes against the natural desires and functions of what we are programmed to have . 
  people that do n't want to have kids do n't call their decisions an `` inborn identity '' . 
  people that are infertile are also suffering from an illness ( infertility ) . 
  it causes population decline , which is not a good thing . 
  whether or not russia turned a blind eye to it is another debate , but i am just saying that it is not legal under russian law to kill gay people . 
  i did n't say gay sex never happened . 
  homosexuality \u2260 gay sex . 
  homosexuality is a recent thing . 
  the concept of a gay marriage did n't even exist back then . 
  in mesopotamia , non-aristocratic straight people lived together as partners and raised children . 
  gay people never lived together like a couple would . 
  i agree that the concept of heterosexuality is bogus . 
  sexuality is a pseudoscience . 
  you 're either normal or you are n't . 
  gay rights advocate ( who was lesbian herself ) dr. faderman :  `` the concept of a gay and lesbian identity may be nothing more than a social construct , but it has been crucial , enabling us to become a political movement and demand the rights that are due to us as a minority . 
  ** what becomes of our political movement if we openly acknowledge that sexuality is flexible and fluid , that gay and lesbian does not signify ' a people ' but rather a ` sometime behavior ' ? 
  ** '' - the advocate , 9-5-95 , page 43, 
  yes . 
  russia investigated and found nothing . 
  it is not legal under russian law to just kill gay people . 
  under russian law , pro-gay propaganda is illegal and that 's it . 
  it was just a sometimes behavior , not a sexual orientation . 
  if they got married , then that would signify that it was on the same level of heterosexuality back then . 
  but that is not the case . 
  watch it first and then come back to me . 
  i did n't say it was peer reviewed . 
  i was just offering you a different perspective . 
  i am only not for free speech for people promoting harmful ideals . 
  the ancient mesopotamians practiced pederasty , nothing remotely like today . 
  same sex unions or marriages did n't exist among the ancient mesopotamians . 
  you have no proof that homosexuality existed in the west before the late 19th century . 
  the closest thing you will get are the pederasts molesting underage boys in ancient greece and whatnot , not homosexuality as we have it today , which is a modern invention . 
  [ societies where homosexuality does not exist . 
  ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/where-masturbation-and-homosexuality-do-not-exist/265849/ ), 
  did you watch the facebook video ? 
  it 's a series of interviews by a journalist with extensive research on the topic . 
  in the video , it is basically just gay people speaking about how they turned gay . 
  watch it , i guarantee it will be eye opening . 
  and then at the end of the video , the journalist quotes famous gay rights activists . 
   it is when you deny one group to speak and the other not since anti-gay propaganda is okay . 
  anti-gay propaganda is necessary to keep russia from normalizing homosexuality . 
   it violates free speech , thought you guys were all for that . 
  i 'm not libertarian . 
   animals and children ca n't give consent . 
  incest to a degree is even legal in a lot of countries . 
  cousins marrying cousins is incest and legal in plenty of countries . 
  though if you want to advocate even more incest you are free to do so no ? 
  i 'm just saying that if you grant gays their rights , then you have to do the same with others or else you are going to be a massive hypocrite . 
  animals can consent . 
  if you tried engaging in sex with them and they did not consent , they would not allow you to engage with them or kick you off while you were having sex ( or attempting to have sex ) with them . 
   free speech is subjective today ...  _  human rights is , in this context . 
   you need to learn history ; homosexuality has been part of the world . 
  the hang up over homosexuality is a pretty western/abrahamic though . 
  the first ever person to claim to be exclusively attracted to men and that his gayness was inborn was a german named karl heinrich ulrichs in 1861 . 
  name ** one ** gay person that existed before 1862 . 
  and do n't name people that committed gay [ pedophilic ] acts because of cultural reasons , but people that actually identified as gay or at least engaged in relations with other adults of the same sex comparable to the way they do today . 
  you wo n't be able to since homosexuality is a completely modern concept that is often cause by trauma or some form of abuse . 
  that explanation implies that being gay is just like being straight , which is not true . 
  it 's also very biased towards modern western european culture . 
   telling kids gay people exist wo n't transform them into raging homosexuals . 
  it will normalize it and make them question their sexual orientation as they 're growing older and go through experiences . 
   homosexuality is not a disease you can catch , either . 
  homosexuality can be `` caught '' . 
  you are not born that way . 
  paste the bottom text into facebook and you 'll get a video of gay people admitting on hidden cam their experiences that led to them becoming gay . 
  its often because of stuff like getting raped at a young age , negative experience with the opposite sex , etc. 
  and then the video concludes with very interesting quotes thrown around by gay rights activists . 
  / rsorba/videos/vb .6239808 / 10103748264659433 / ? type = 2 & theater, 
  the echr have a pro-gay agenda they want to push . 
  their bar of human rights is very subjective . 
  russia not being pro-gay propaganda is a violation of human rights apparently . 
  just cause it violates `` gay rights '' does not mean that its wrong . 
  zoophiles and pro-incest folk can argue that their rights are being violated if their practices are n't legal . 
  so human rights here is very subjective . 
  fortunately , russia will most likely just ignore this ruling like they have done in the past . 
  homosexuality is an unnatural and completely modern western liberal concept . 
  russia does not need to normalize it in their country . 
  okay , well i do n't know about that , but i do know that danish is at least genetically closest to swedish . 
  norwegian is a west scandinavian language whereas swedish and danish are both east scandinavian languages .
