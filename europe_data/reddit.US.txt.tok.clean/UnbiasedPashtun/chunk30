  i do n't think that hatred of islam is neccessarily anti-muslim . 
  it 's just that a lot of people who are anti-islam are also anti-muslim but they will go by the label `` islamophobe '' so that their hatred has some legitimacy . 
  i would n't say you are anti-muslim . 
  however , there are some people who shoehorn islam into any crime committed by muslims as if literally any sort of imperfect action done by muslims is somehow ultimately religious in nature . 
  when a muslim commits a non-religiously motivated crime ( e.g. 
  killing a cat , bestiality , robbery , rape , etc. 
  ) , and then you try to use his religion as an excuse to bash muslims , then i 'd say that person is anti-muslim . 
  i 've argued with * a lot * of people like that a lot here . 
  those type of people treat muslim like an ethnicity/race and use muslim similar to how most people would use white , black , indian , etc. 
  also , the type of people that cheer violence against muslims deserve to be called anti-muslim rather than their preferred term anti-islam . 
  btw , i 've heard the term christianophobia a few times ( although its rarely used compared to islamophobia ) but never heard christianityophobia . 
  the `` i dislike islam not muslims '' is [ often , but not always ] just an excuse used to legitimize their bigotry by diguising it as a purely ideological hatred as opposed to a hatred of a people group . 
  `` these people '' refers to guys like in the op ( the van driver ) and trump-supporting type alt-righters . 
  if you run a van into someone cause of their religion or if you demonize people cause of their religion , you hate them for being a member of that religion . 
  the guy in the op clearly hated muslim people . 
  there is a reason why hatred of x-people is called anti-x sentiment most of the times . 
  so it makes more sense to call hatred of muslim people anti-muslim sentiment or muslimophobia . 
  calling it anti-islam or islamophobia is just legitimizing their hatred towards a people group cause then they can just say `` we hate islam and not muslims '' . 
  do you believe that the alt-right that demonizes muslims constantly solely hates islam and not muslims ? 
  they 're just not proper equivalents . 
  one is an ideological community and the other is a racial one . 
  one is inborn whereas the other is more of a result of their upbringing . 
  conflating the two gives the other side a lot of room to straw man and misrepresent the argument . 
  just do n't mix the two and you will avoid a headache . 
  okay , i guess i confused the arrival time with the population living there . 
  but still , the terrorist attacks are in response to foreign policy . 
  i 'm not denying there is n't any ideological/islamic justification ( by the terrorists ) behind the attacks though , just that the catalyst here is foreign policy . 
  okay , i am just saying that calling them anti-islam/islamophobe rather than anti-muslim is playing into their hands . 
  calling them anti-islam implies that their hatred is solely against the ideology and not against the people , when their rhetoric and actions prove that they view muslim people the same way that white supremacists view black people . 
  that only applies to mainland europe , not the uk . 
  the south asians in the uk started arriving before the 90 's . 
  most of the pakistani-british community arrived in the 60 's from the mirpur district as refugees cause the mangla dam was being built there . 
  i know the difference , and these people hate muslims . 
  having some muslim friends does n't absolve you of that hatred . 
  except the people that do attacks like the one in the news story we 're discussing are better characterized as anti-muslim rather than anti-islam . 
  the equivalent to muslim community would be christian community , not white community . 
  you ca n't compare a race with an ideology . 
  why specify the 1970 's ? 
  the attacks started happening post-2001 . 
  anti-islam ? 
  you mean anti-muslim . 
  that would imply that ukrainains , belorussians , and muscovites are all one ethnicity called `` russian '' and muscovites are the only ones that kept the original name . 
  okay , that 's what i thought , but the user made it seem like eastern catholic and roman catholic were two equally separate branches . 
  so greek catholics are closer to roman catholics than to armenian catholics ? 
  paeonians were not ethnic greeks like the macedonians were . 
  greece does n't assume a monopoly on the paeonian identity like it does with macedonian one . 
  greece should have no problem with fyrom calling itself paeonia , go ask about it on r/greece if you do n't believe me . 
  and if they do have a problem with it , then vardarska works . 
  are all eastern catholics closer to each other than any of them are to roman catholics ? 
  by eastern catholics , are you referring to greek catholics ? 
   a diocese is an episcopal see what 's an episcopal see ? 
  in pre-soviet times , poland was n't way more religious than slovakia , hungary , etc. 
  like it is today . 
  russia 's leadership ( putin & co. ) is religious , but the populace is n't all that much . 
  russia 's religiosity is very overrated . 
  you can ask about it on r/russia . 
  it would have been more controversial if he put the vergina star flag . 
  you should have put the gypsy flag on romania instead , lol . 
  also , the uk flag over roi and the irish flag over northern ireland . 
  how childish ... no other country has this problem . 
  why do n't they just officially declare it their capital then ? 
  * its inside rome . 
  * most people there speak italian . 
  * tiniest country in the world . 
  * the pope lives there . 
  he serves as their head . 
  * a turkish guy tried to assassinate pope john paul ii , but he failed ( despite shooting him ) . 
  he got pardoned by the pope who visited the prison to forgive him . 
  then when pope john paul ii died , he visited his grave and laid flowers on the pope 's tomb . 
  * pope john paul ii is the reason why poland is significantly more religious than all its neighboring countries . 
  * they supported the ustashas during ww2 . 
  * only absolute monarchy in europe . 
  * only country without a capital . 
  * i know its not the same as the holy see but i do n't know what the difference between the two is .
