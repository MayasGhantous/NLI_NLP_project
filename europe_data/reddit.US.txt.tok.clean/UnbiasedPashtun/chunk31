  i guess the the vatican city is a subdivision of the holy see ? 
  paeonians lived in their former territory . 
  they will start identifying as paeonians if the name change happens . 
  they have a much more legitimate claim to paeonian history than to macedonian history after all . 
  rename it to paeonia . 
  paeonia works fine . 
  do you have a link to the article that cites him saying that ? 
  did i say otherwise ? 
  -_- i was just saying how it would make sense for hungarian separatists living in romania to identify more as european and not romanian . 
  what if the place is owned by hungarian separatists ? 
   they do not have enough influence to make any real change outside of northern ireland , nor would they want to so reddit is basically freaking out for no reason then ? 
  how much of an effect will dup views/policy proposals have in the current ruling government ? 
  i know they 're aligned with the tories , but the tories tend to be much more liberal than them . 
  with them in government , what different stuff can we expect ? 
  ca n't the same be said for christianity then ? 
  they were n't proven to be bullshit . 
  just reread your earlier statement and sources again ( i was very sleepy last night ) . 
  just because those men are n't interested in adults does n't mean that they are not homosexuals . 
  homosexual = same-sex attraction . 
  man molesting boy is homosexuality on display . 
  muslims do n't worship jesus as god . 
  same with the mosaic law i think . 
  no it would n't . 
  american christians are far more progressive that muslims . 
  maybe if it was ethiopian or nigerian christians , then the numbers could be comparable . 
  how does the nt make no sense without the ot ? 
  not as much as christians are . 
  creationism is an islamic thing as well . 
  the countries you listed only have some aspects of sharia law , they do n't have proper sharia law . 
  if 9-40 % of pedos are gay , then that means gays are over represented in pedophilia . 
  ireland usually only refers to the republic or the island of ireland . 
  nobody uses generic ireland when referring specifically to the country in the north . 
  i knew a guy who was the son of a hanafi imam and he did n't have a tv at home ( though he did have a computer ) . 
  how much of this is official dup policy ? 
  probably barely any of it . 
  just cause dup members do n't like line dancing and pray a lot does n't mean want it as official party policy . 
  they went from liking men * only * to being straight . 
  changing your sexuality is n't impossible . 
  weird considering how different ulster-scots and scotland-scots have become . 
  i get what you 're saying but you ca n't compare the guys in the op to muslim extremists ( isis ) , which is what it sounded like you were doing in your post . 
  sodomy is basically the blanket term for homosexuality , zoophilia , pedophilia , etc. 
  that means there was n't conclusive proof for that one specific part . 
  read the sentence before that :  this suggests that the resulting proportion of true pedophiles among persons with a homosexual erotic development is greater than that in persons who develop heterosexually . 
  also , they have their own organization called nambla which was started when gay rights groups were at its infancy stage ( founded in 1978 ) . 
  the ` born that way ' myth was started in 1985 to legitimize the gay identity . 
  before that , it was often viewed more of as an act than an identity . 
  the founders of all the infant gay rights movements were all pedophiles . 
  non-pedo gays are a recent phenomenon . 
  a very large amount of gays are the way they are because they were molested at a young age or had some other form of psychological trauma . 
  uc davic is a progressive university with a clear agenda . 
  if you bothered to click on my links and skim through some of them , then you 'd get a clearer picture of the situation . 
  i see you did n't bother to check out any of my links . 
  boys are massively over represented in cases where the pedophile is male . 
   pedophiles often prefere children because they are in a position of power in that relationship and they do n't care whether it is a boy or a girl . 
  straight men do n't molest boys , they molest girls . 
  since boys are disproportionately represented in molestation cases , this means that pedos are more likely to be gay . 
  this is n't surprising since throughout all of history , all cases of male-male sex were cases of pedophilia .

  how ? 
   robinson 's wife , iris , had said that homosexuality was an abomination and that with help , gay people could be `` turned around '' . 
  he 's not wrong . 
  there are many people that used to identify as gay , but then got married with a woman . 
  only recently have the two no longer been synonyms . 
  every single `` gay '' historical figure can be found in [ this list ] ( http://lgbt.wikia.com/wiki/historical_pederastic_couples ) of historic pedophile relationships . 
  even today , there seems to be a significant correlation between the two . 
  muslim extremists kill gays . 
  christian extremists are against gay rights but do n't kill them . 
  muslim extremists do n't let women leave the house without a male guardian and do stuff like honor killing . 
  what is the christian extremist equivalent here ? 
  having a woman be a housewife but can still go outside and everything ? 
  not really comparable . 
  [ no they do n't . 
  ] ( http://www.familyresearchinst.org/2012/08/how-do-the-kids-of-homosexual-parents-turn-out-the-best-evidence/ ), 
  actually , [ they do fare worse ] ( http://www.frc.org/issuebrief/new-study-on-homosexual-parents-tops-all-previous-research ) . 
  also , the term ` hillbilly ' in usa is in reference to ulster-scots since they called themselves ` billy boys ' ( in reference to king william ) and they lived in a hilly area . 
  they 're unionists . 
  in the uk , a unionist ( or loyalist ) refers to someone that supports a unified uk whereas a nationalist refers to someone that wants to see a united ireland . 
  unionists still exist in the republic of ireland ? 
  where is `` christian extremism '' here ? 
  muslim extremism is murder and terrorism . 
  there is no christian equivalent being shown in the op . 
  only recently have the two no longer been synonyms .

  he said the only thing worse than homosexuality and sodomy is pedophilia . 
  theresa may : `` okay , as you wish corbyn '' . 
  or switzerland or arguably spain and italy . 
  just cause not all european countries are ethnostates does n't mean that we ca n't generalize europe as a whole as a continent divided into ethnostates . 
  many people in asia and africa view europe as a model for balkanizing their countries along ethnic lines . 
  i do n't get the joke . 
  you guys should also replace < ch  with < x  to make it even more simpler . 
  what you are thinking of is called west-central german/ripuarian frankish/middle frankish . 
  it includes luxembourgish as well . 
  allemanic refers to the dialect grouping in southwest germany , switzerland , vorarlberg , and liechtenstein . 
  so if you ca n't understand it but still want to call it a dialect anyways , then what needs to happen for it to be considered a separate language ? 
  standardization ?
