  alemannic dialects as a whole are considered separate from shg ( standard high german ) . 
  they are at least on ethnologue and many germans told me that they ca n't understand alemannic dialects . 
  its a form of high german but considered separate from standard german . 
  germans need subtitles when watching alemannic movies from switzerland . 
  * its basically a city that now functions as its own country . 
  * their national language is german but they natively speak alemannic . 
  * switzerland invaded it by accident in 2007 . 
  * their country 's name means ` lightstone ' - * liecht * ( light ) + * stein * ( stone ) . 
  * is a principality . 
  * most do n't lock their door cause of the very low crime rate . 
  * third highest gdp per capita after luxembourg and qatar . 
  * you can rent the country . 
  * they use the swiss franc as their currency and play in switzerland 's football league . 
  * not part of the eu but part of the eea . 
  they most likely meant to say west asia instead of asia minor . 
  there 's no way it could be the hittites as the hittites were n't remotely close to being one of the earliest civilizations . 
  they also did nothing special . 
  nah , the hittite civilization was thousands of years later . 
  they 're referring to mesopotamia/sumer . 
  back then , proto-indo-europeans ( let alone hittites ) did n't even exist . 
   indo europeans ( was n't it indo iranians ? 
  who went to india ? ), 
  indo-iranians are a subgroup of indo-europeans . 
  there are many irish that say they are ethnic irish despite not speaking the language . 
  would n't that put livonians in the same boat as them ? 
  it was still an ancient civilization . 
  not one of the most successful , but still an ancient civilization . 
  civilization was a thing for a long time when greece and the phoenicians came into the picture in the bronze age . 
  it would be more accurate to say indus valley than india as india was not a thing yet . 
  it would be like saying iraq instead of mesopotamia . 
  the ivc was one of the first civilizations . 
  the oldest ever university ( taxila ) is from there . 
  by asia minor , they 're referring to much further back than that ( i.e. 
  at one time during francoist ( ? ), 
  spain , the term [ * balompi\u00e9 * ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/balompi%c3%a9 ) was coined , which is a literal translation of ` football ' in spanish . 
   bring it up during a conversation ? 
  ` you are obviously xenophobic and hate muslims ' that does n't happen if you specify saudi arabia/wahhabists . 
  what happened to the poland 's sorbs ? 
  why do they only live in germany now ? 
  side question , why do you want autonomy for upper silesia ? 
  what is that green region ? 
  the bbc does not have a party bias but it does have a liberal bias in the way it is pro-multiculturalism and pro-lgbt . 
  the fact that they had literally no militant separatist organization means there would n't have been violence , just some discontent . 
   you never know how those things can escalate . 
  just like spain refusing catalonia a referendum made the desire for independence shoot up , and britain allowing scotland a referendum ended up with a pretty convincing in result . 
  better to just keep access to the sea and a historic province than to risk it like that . 
  a large portion of montenegro was/is very pro-serbia and identifies as ethnic serb anyways . 
   you 're pretty confidently stating that war is impossible ignoring the fact that the region saw tons of wars for that exact same reason ? 
  because there is a difference between croat/bosniak/albanian nationalism and montenegrin nationalism . 
  montenegro did n't have a violent separatist army trying to divide serbia . 
  there were just some people who were like `` we 'd be better off separate '' . 
  just like how spain is refusing catalonia a referendum , serbia should have done the same with montenegro . 
  montenegro would n't have gone to war if it did n't have a referendum . 
  serbia should n't have allowed the referendum . 
  now they lost a historically ethnic serb province and access to the sea . 
  they could have kept it and nothing would have happened to them . 
  i do n't see the point you 're trying to make . 
  what religion are polish people ? 
  do n't play dumb . 
  yeah , whatever . 
  i know you lot do n't like to hear this viewpoint . 
  i only mentioned worldnews to show how much people care about religion whenever a mena person is involved . 
  what am i pulling out of thin air ? 
  my point was that people only care about religion when menas are involved but never care about it when poles or other christian ethnic groups are involved . 
  do you not understand english ? 
  or did you just skip 95 % of what i wrote ? 
   and even more unfounded assumptions . 
  sorry , stay in your little bubble , where somehow polish gypsies are connected with reddit wide injustice against muslims/arabs . 
  i never said that . 
  i just said christianity is always given a free pass whenever christians commit a crime whereas islam is n't when muslims do the exact same thing . 
  so i was just pointing out this hypocrisy . 
  nice of you to use lazy strawmans though . 
   how many polish romas have you met that were n't ? 
  gypsies take on the religion of the country they live in . 
  gypsies in muslim countries are almost all muslim and the ones in christian countries are almost all christian . 
  there are exceptions to this of course , but this is usually the case . 
  so its reasonable to assume the ones in poland are mainly christian catholic . 
   they bring ethnicity , region and nationality into the spotlight instead . 
  the purpose is the same : to paint a big group of people with broad strokes . 
  functionally there 's no difference . 
  there is a massive difference . 
  if an arab person murders someone and people reference him as a ` muslim ' as opposed to an ` arab ' ( usually the case ) , then they have free license to bash him all they want `` because muslim is not a race '' . 
  if a polish person murders some and people reference him as ` polish ' as opposed to ` catholic ' ( usually the case ) , then it is considered racism and much much much more widely condemned . 
  functionally , there is a * huge * difference . 
  you just do n't notice it because christians are never racialized . 
  if christians were racialized like muslims are , then it would bother you too . 
   yes . 
  use control + f and type ` muslim ' or ` islam ' and see how many people are talking about it . 
  its not as much as i thought in the links i gave , but it still happens . 
  i just found these quickly , there are plenty more . 
  this sub : [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2u34w1/rotherham_victim_says_abusers_untouchable_sky/ ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4yie7f/do_you_know_that_sweden_has_the_highest_rape_rate/ ) [ 3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ar24o/iraqis_alarmingly_over_represented_in_rape/ ) the less civil / worldnews : [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5ax2y7/a_society_that_cant_defend_its_children_has_no/ ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4s7ted/report_over_1200_women_assaulted_in_germany_on/ ) this is just for rape btw , for murder there are also similar comments . 
  and you ca n't find anything similar to this for christian-majority ethnic groups . 
  just look at this thread . 
  besides my comment , christianity is mentioned nowhere . 
  the link that you gave only states that polish people are stereotyped as religious people . 
  it does n't say that religion is the sole reason polish people commit crimes . 
  go look up any article regarding anytime a christian is committing a crime . 
  if people in the comments section are trying to make the crime a religious act , then come back to me . 
   naturally i will . 
  chances for an abdul in poland not being an immigrant from a muslim country are probably similar to the chance of winning the main prize in a national lottery .
