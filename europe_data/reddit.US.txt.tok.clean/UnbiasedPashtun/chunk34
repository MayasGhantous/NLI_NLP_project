  the western moravians got assimilated into the czechs ( bohemians ) whereas the eastern moravians became the slovaks . 
  they also have a river named after them ( or vice versa ? ) . 
  * ~ ~ second ~ ~ most atheist country in europe ~ ~ after estonia ~ ~ . 
  traditionally catholic majority . 
  * czechoslovakia got split because of politicians that wanted power even though the majority of czechs and slovaks were against the split . 
  * transcarpathia used to be part of czechoslovakia . 
  * sudetenland was german majority but czechs claimed it on historic grounds . 
  they claimed slovakia on ethnic grounds even though it was part of hungary at the time . 
  * part of the visegrad four group . 
  * second most developed slavic country after slovenia . 
  * highest rate of beer consumption per capita in the world . 
  * was part of the holy roman empire , austrian empire , & austro-hungarian empire making it more associated with western europe than eastern europe before the cold war . 
  * they accepted huguenot refugees . 
   if you find authentic frisian samples with enough snps and recorded ancestors from that region then contact me and this dendogram will be updated to include them at some point . 
  you collected all this dna and made it yourself ? 
  or maybe west slavs are of german origin ? 
  both west slavs and east germans are fairly mixed with each other so it makes sense for them to be genetically similar based on their location and whatnot . 
  also , the original slavs were from ukraine who are genetically different to west slavs . 
  slavic is just a language . 
  just cause slovenes speak slavic does n't mean that they 're representative of the dna of the original slavic tribes that came from ukraine . 
  finns are n't ugrics though . 
  ** edit : ** why is this getting downvoted ? 
  finns are a subdivision of finno-ugrics not ugrics . 
  poles got attacked mainly cause they were eu migrants and the brexit vote was linked to the uk 's ties to the eu . 
  also , many non-poles were attacked as well . 
  if that 's literally your only form of evidence that poles are the most hated in the uk , then that is very poor . 
  did you not notice melania trump ? 
  they 're different because they assimilated into irish society and considered themselves irish rather than british . 
   but that immigrants are a threat to culture , take jobs , and use lots of welfare if you read the comments in this thread , most seem to be singling out muslim immigrants for terrorism/violence . 
  people do n't care about sikhs , hindus , poles , etc. 
  coming ( in fact many people here are praising them ) . 
  so the issue is solely violence/terrorism . 
  they follow mecca 's time i believe . 
  here are two articles that write about those cases and they say that they follow mecca 's time : [ 1 ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/how-to-fast-for-ramadan-in-the-arctic-where-the-sun-doesnt-set/277834/ ) [ 2 ] ( http://mentalfloss.com/article/51746/how-do-muslims-fast-ramadan-if-there%e2%80%99s-no-sunset ), 
  the difference is canada ( and usa to a lesser extent ) import more selectively so the crop of immigrants is better . 
  in most of western europe , they just import anything with a pulse and they do n't do background checks ever ( which is they had these terrorist attacks ) . 
  [ link 1 ] ( http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/canadas-immigration-policy-focus-human-capital ) [ link 2 ] ( http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-may-canada-immigration-policy-20161227-story.html ), 
  well i do n't hear of rape gangs , no-go zones , large scale violence from immigrants , etc. 
  in canada like i do with western europe . 
  bs , where is your proof for that ? 
  canada integrates foreigners multitudes better than europe does though . 
   holy shit . 
  you know you fuckep up when a saudi shows up in the comment to say that you 're going too far with religious `` freedom '' . 
  most saudis on english-speaking websites tend to be fairly secular . 
  the japanese empire only controlled foreign land for a mere 25 years . 
  worst comparison possible . 
  also 85 % of the population is english . 
  so if the poll was only done in scotland , then the results would be similar to the ones in the article ? 
  according to most of the comments here , most people do n't seem to be opposed to losing their culture/becoming a minority in their country , but are simply opposed to culture that brings violence/terrorism . 
   people say : ark , chuggypig , snirlygog , smeachy , dimpsy , gurt . 
  what do those words mean ? 
  they were n't ethnic irish . 
  they were brits based in ireland . 
   and probably black people do n't agree with that . 
  they 're just less of a target . 
  the brits are expats living there temporarily not looking to settle and start a family . 
   remember they are expats not immigrants cause they 're there temporarily . 
  how popular is lindenstrasse and german state tv in general ? 
  by liberal , he means progressive . 
  lets not nitpick . 
  lincoln was a republican but he was not a conservative . 
  what has bbc said that is anti-hindu ? 
  70 % came as refugees from a single district . 
  afaik , the district ( mirpur ) is known to be pretty rural and conservative ( and considering they came as refugees they were more likely to be of a lower economic background making it harder for them to integrate ) . 
  the pakistanis in english america ( usa , canada ) are much more integrated than the ones in the uk . 
  really is putting america first :p, 
  irc ? 
  the joke is also very corny . 
   but other than that , meh . 
  they also funded the houthi terrorists in yemen . 
  i am aware of all that . 
  its the reason why n1c is the most common haplogroup among finns . 
  the proto-uralics who originated in the ural mountains region were probably mongoloid . 
  even nowadays , you can still find some finns with visible east asian influence . 
  but there is a difference between saying they have partial east asian dna and saying that they 're related to central asian nomadic tribes , the latter is what op claimed . 
  in the 1800 's , some finnish linguist theorized a linguistic group called `` turanic '' and turanic languages included all `` altaic '' , turkic , mongolic , and uralic languages . 
  because of this , i assume some folk like the op think that finns came from central asia , which is not true . 
  thanks , fixed it . 
  turkey is european according to this sub ( the mods of it at least ) . 
  the sidebar has all the countries that this sub considers european , and it includes turkey . 
  thanks , edited . 
  yes , but urals \u2260 central asia . 
   their ancestors are somehow related with central asian nomadic tribes . 
  that 's a myth . 
  * capital is helsinki . 
  * ice hockey is the most popular sport there . 
  * they are a little bit more conservative than scandinavians . 
  * called * suomi * in finnish . 
  * the name * finn * used to be historically applied to uralics in general before being restricted to the finns , which is why the historically lapp ( * saami * ) region of norway ( finnmark ) has the term finn in it despite finns never being the majority there . 
  * there 's a very corny overused joke about it not existing that started cause some random guy on reddit said that his parents did n't believe in the existence of finland . 
  they also have a rivalry with the netherlands , which i think is exclusive to this sub . 
  * finland , along with the baltics , was one of the last european lands to convert to christianity . 
  * finland became christian after the swedes conquered it in the 12th century , and it stayed under swedish rule until 1809 . 
  that 's why their language has * a lot * of swedish loanwords . 
  like sweden , it has `` botten '' in the name of some of its regions . 
  it shares the karelia region with russia ( russian-karelians are the only orthodox finnics ) . 
  * finland was part of russia from 1809-1917 . 
  in 1917 , finland became independent for the first time ever . 
  * prior to the russification of ingria , it used to be majority ingrian finnish . 
  the ingrian finns are descended from 17th century migrants from finland .
