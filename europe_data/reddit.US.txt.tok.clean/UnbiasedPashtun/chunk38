  could he have been a moldovan of russian origin ? 
  * serbo-croatian = standardized registers of serbian , croatian , bosnian , and montenegrin . 
  they are pretty different stuff . 
  serbo-croatian refers to only the standardized variety of a specific dialect . 
  whoa , nice informative write up !, 
  i do n't know much about hungarian politics . 
  could you tell me why orban is considered undemocratic ? 
  what was the reaction after he got assassinated ? 
  how do you think the netherlands would have looked today if he were still alive ? 
   you mean after it got conquered by russia it got to be called bessarabia . 
  there was no reason to call it bessarabia before the russian conquest as is was just a part of moldavia . 
  yes , my bad . 
  that was a typo . 
  edited above . 
   i 'm not sure about this or let 's say the situation is more complicated . 
  standard moldovan is the same as standard romanian . 
  moldovans use more slavic words in their spoken-language but these are mostly russian words they took up after they were included in the russian/soviet empire . 
  there was no serious campaing in romania to replace slavic words with latin words , it 's mostly that the new words that entered the language in the xviii-xix centuries ( related to science , urban/modern life etc. ), 
  were taken & adapted from ( mostly ) french rather than from the surrounding slavic languages . 
  this is not exactly true . 
  during the 19th century , romanian was re-latinized and expunged of a lot of slavic words and those were replaced with french and italian words . 
  ion heliade r\u0103dulescu was a man that played a significant role in the re-latinization of romanian . 
  [ link 1  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_lexis#modern_romanian_reforms ) * in the 19th century , as the romanian society transitioned from rural and agricultural towards urban and industrial , the lexis underwent a vigorous enrichment with loanwords from its romance relatives , french and italian . 
  many scholarly and technical terms were also imported from neo-latin . 
  some words , especially of greek ( arvun\u0103 , ipochimen , simandicos ) and turkish ( acadea , beizadea , hat\u00e2r ) origin , fell into relative disuse or acquired an ironic connotation . 
  the slavic part of the lexis , of earlier entry and more deeply anchored into the language , survived relatively unscathed . 
  * [ link 2  ( http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/romanian.html ) * in the first half of the 19th century there began an `` enlightenment '' in romania . 
  books from the west by authors such as racine , moliere , and lamartine were translated into romanian . 
  at this time a romanian writer and theorist , ion heliade r | dulescu wrote his opinion on the purification of the romanian literary language . 
  he wanted to `` s | ne unim \u00een scris \u00d5i s | ne facem o limb | literar | '' [ unite ourselves in writing and to make for ourselves a literary language ] . 
  he began to cultivate the romanian literary language . 
  [ to cultivate a language is to clean it of all that which does n't make it progress ] . 
  heliade 's movement began by selecting italian words and eliminating contributions to the language from german , russian and greek . 
  in 1828 he wrote , `` scrie\u00dbi cum s | v | \u00een\u00dbeleag | contemporanii . 
  [ you write to be understood by your contemporaries . 
  we write for those who live and not for the dead . 
  * / u/pokymonn  nowadays most of them speak russian and much less gagauz , their `` native '' language . 
  really ? 
  well , at least their gagauz identity is intact though . 
   antonescu did annex it back to romania from 1941 to 1944 . 
  bessarabia 's return to romania was one of the main reasons romania entered the war on the side of nazi germany , in order to defeat the soviet union and get the region back ; the soviets had annexed it in 1940 , as a result of the [ molotov -- ribbentrop pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) . 
  ah okay , thanks for the info . 
  i do n't much about eastern europe in that period . 
  i just knew antonescu was a romanian irridentist . 
  yeah , i mentioned in a different comment that moldavia was the latin ( and english ) name whereas moldova was the native romanian name . 
  they both refer to the same historic region but nowadays in english we say moldova instead of moldavia when talking about the country . 
  * romania had three major historic regions : moldova/moldavia , transylvania , and wallachia . 
  the moldova/moldavia region ( which used to include bujak & bukovina ) got split in half when the russians conquered it . 
  nowadays ( in english ) , moldova refers to the country whereas moldavia refers to the historic region . 
  after russian-conquered moldavia ( modern moldova ) got conquered , it was called bessarabia to distinguish it from non-russian conquered moldavia ( the region in romania ) . 
  * romania was created as a union between the principalities of moldavia and wallachia . 
  * moldovan is less latinized than romanian . 
  romania underwent a campaign to artificially replace a lot of slavic words with latin words in romanian . 
  since this did n't happen to moldovan , it retains significantly more slavic words . 
  * transnistria is a breakaway region from moldova that nobody recognizes as a separate state ( except non-un states ) . 
  moldovans are the largest ethnic group there followed by russians . 
  * an oghuz-speaking turkic ethnic group called gagauzes live in the south . 
  [ 99 % of them would want independence if moldova joined romania ] ( http://www.nationalia.info/new/10151/99-of-gagauz-voters-support-declaring-independence-if-moldova-joins-romania ) . 
  more and more moldovans identify as romanian in each census so that day could come one day . 
  * poorest country in europe . 
  * antonescu talked about annexing it i think . 
  moldavia was just the latin name whereas moldova was the native romanian name . 
  in more archaic english , the word `` terrible '' used to mean fearsome even though it does n't anymore . 
  tbf , the royalty makes a lot of money off tourism as well . 
  what 's so special about the uk ? 
  boris was also pro-remain . 
  he thought brexit was a bad idea which is why he avoided becoming pm after brexit happened . 
  my family 's one had cookies in them . 
  i think north frisia also uses a nordic cross . 
  the specific phrase `` remove kebab '' may have started in reference to turks however it got popularized with the serbia stronk video . 
  the meme is saying the phrase in association with video . 
  virtually every time someone says `` remove kebab '' , they are saying it in relation to that video . 
  you are trying to disconnect the phrase from the video and pretending that they have nothing to do with each other . 
  tldr ; the phrase started in reference to turks but is now almost always used in reference to the video ( and the video has nothing to do with turks ) . 
  where did i talk about any two stuff being the same ? 
  iraq and syria were not always in a huge civil war , but they were extremely poor third world countries with an ultra-conservative population , so yes , that was always an issue . 
  the meme started `` remove kebab '' started with turks , i 'll concede that . 
  but the meme got popularized when it was superimposed on the serbia stronk video . 
  and the remove kebab song used by right-wingers is virtually always used in reference to the serbia stronk video . 
  its in africa . 
  i have n't heard of ulster-scots ever referring to him as british . 
  i 'd be more interested to know if the dutch are aware of the respect king william has in ni . 
  the orange is a color of protestants . 
  even though its origins are dutch , its symbolism has changed a bit so its a bit of a stretch to say the orange in the tricolor represents them . 
   some of the anti-russia posts here are worse than the ~ ~ anti-islam ~ ~ anti-muslim post in t_d . 
  ftfy . 
  point taken on the dark jokes thing , although i have never heard that one . 
  it should be noted though that a super popular internet meme that is frequently posted when muslims do something bad or dislikable is different than randomly using dark jokes . 
  and i would be surprised if more countries recognized the bosniak genocide than the armenian one . 
  okay , so it was started on youtube rather than on 4chan . 
  that still does n't change the fact that the `` kebab '' in `` remove kebab '' was in reference to bosniaks and the term `` remove kebab '' is a sign of approval on their removal . 
  true , that is a big difference . 
  i only did n't make that point because i thought it 'd be easier to make a reference in regards to a subject that has no dark jokes ( since that seemed like the argument he was going for ) rather than pointing out the difference . 
  where did i say only white christians make holocaust jokes ? 
  it was the other guy that mentioned holocaust jokes in reply to another guy 's comment on the subject . 
  also , i never mentioned race . 
  even though holocaust jokes are used , they 're more of a taboo than saying remove kebab and they are just considered dark jokes not an extremely popular internet meme that gets referenced constantly ( which is far worse ) . 
  and i never hear anyone make jokes on the slav christians that were killed by the nazis or the christian victims of the genocides done by the ottomans , let alone start an internet meme out of those atrocities . 
  those are not actual events of history that many people were traumatized over . 
  those stuff are akin to right-wingers joking about removing liberals , not the srebrenica genocide .
