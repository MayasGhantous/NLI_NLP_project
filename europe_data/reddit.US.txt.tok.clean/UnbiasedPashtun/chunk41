  i expected serbia to also be `` piss off '' . 
  all hungarians think of croatia is `` cheap hotels '' ? 
  yep , i was referring to the former . 
  thanks for the info , but i was talking about the mythical vampire dracula . 
  he 's based off of an 1897 horror novel and in the novel he refers to himself as a ` szekler magyar ' . 
  he 's a hungarian from romania . 
  ** edit : ** to the people downvoting , i am talking about the vampire . 
  nobody calls vlad a hungarian -_-, 
  do you ever get pmed lady boys ? 
  the op of this comment chain is british and pretty much said the same thng as me ... 
  the irish have n't always been this cozy with the scots . 
  their current attitude towards scotland is a relatively recent shift from their previous attitude where it was seen in the same ( arguably worse ) negative light as england . 
  probably cause a whole lot of scots want to divide the uk . 
  i was n't aware of that , til . 
  i had always assumed the iranian theory was based off the relationship with arachosia . 
  that 's very interesting if true . 
  it would be nice if you could find a link on it . 
  i guess if he did n't like bosniaks , then he probably would n't have occupied most of their land in the first place though . 
  he was a salian frank , which is basically the same ethnicity as dutch people . 
  can you link me to the wikipedia article that says that ? 
  ** edit : ** yes , * stein * in english is a neologism . 
  i thought you were referring to the relationship between * stone * and * stein * as a neologism . 
   so , greeks are located in the balkan peninsula but are not slavs and thus consider themselves markedly different from the slavic balkan nationalities . 
  romanians and albanians are also balkaners but not slavs . 
  really , the only reason people are trying to distance themselves from ee is cause its seen as backwards . 
  i 've also seen poles ( who are slavs ) do the same . 
  yep , greece is the core of eastern europe and the definition of eastern europe has historically been in reference to countries more influenced by greece whereas western europe referred to countries more influenced by rome . 
  i think the word you meant to say is ` cognate ' . 
  a ` neologism ' is a newly invented word ( e.g. 
  meme , brainwash , etc. ), 
  whereas a ` cognate ' is a word that shares the same origin like stein-stone , liecht-light , etc. 
  agreed . 
  does he have the same opinion on gibraltar ? 
  i meant how does the whole system work :p, 
  * stein * means ` stone ' though . 
  no way france can do worse than the other three even if they elect le pen . 
   the opposite can also be asked , what cultural features does greece share with croatia or bosnia that it does n't with italy or spain ? 
  religion ( to a large extent ) , food , history , behavior , clothing , etc. 
   to answer your question , italians and spaniards are non-slavs same as greeks . 
  what about albanians and romanians ? 
   second , greece never had communism unlike most ( all ? ), 
  of the other balkan countries . 
  that 's literally the only reason why greece is n't considered part of eastern europe . 
  but i do n't get the need to place such a strong emphasis on that one thing that only lasted a few decades and is mostly irrelevant now . 
   i would also say food is more similar but i guess it depends on the balkan country . 
  nah , greece has more foods in common even with turkey than spain or italy . 
   even greek mythology is almost the same with italian . 
  greek mythology also has some similarities with hinduism . 
  also , i would be extremely surprised if greek mythology was closer to roman mythology than to illyrian , paeonian , thrakian , or dakian mythology . 
   i have been to poland , czech rep. , lithuania , italy , spain and portugal and i can tell you the latter 3 are far more similar to greece than the former 3 . 
  so basically greece is closer to italy & iberia than to baltic countries ? 
  not very surprising . 
  try visiting bulgaria or serbia . 
  a random albanian/slav-macedonian politician giving a speech on the education system of fyr macedonia or albania compared to a random portuguese politician doing the same would of course be not relevant to greece in the slightest . 
  when i say fyrom/albania have more political similarities to greece , i am mentioning stuff that politically tie them to greece . 
  fyrom is politically tied to greece because of the naming dispute and albania a bit because of its greek population in north epirus . 
  portugal and spain in contrast have no political ties to greece ( except for being part of the eu but that is n't an east vs. west thing ) . 
  but even if they do have some ties i 'm unaware of , that does n't negate all my other points . 
  what cultural features does greece share with italy or spain that it does n't with the balkans ? 
  ** food ** the food is definitely balkan , nice to see you acknowledge that . 
  ** traditional clothing ** [ bulgarian ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/75/23/e3/7523e37583a6e6b1fae378be90a16769.jpg ) [ romanian ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/0c/33/63/0c3363e15bd0353445dc9e3f53a19ed0.jpg ) [ serb ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/49/bb/1f/49bb1fb9f40d19118e548f2647baca3c.gif ) [ greek ] ( http://www.costumes.gr/stoles/642123.jpg ) ** politics ** something happening in albania would or the republic of macedonia/fyrom would be more relevant to greece than something happening in portugal . 
  ** language ** greek is consider part of the [ balkan sprachbund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_sprachbund ) . 
  ** behavior ** squatting is n't an eastern european thing . 
  its mostly just an east slavic thing . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.quora.com/why-isnt-greece-usually-considered-a-balkan-country-together-with-former-yugoslavian-countries-albania-and-bulgaria ) is an answer from quora by a greek user that mentions greek balkan behavior ( in addition to a few other stuff like food ) :  it 's crazy that some people do n't consider us balkans . 
  we are considered balkans too !, 
   we say ( h ) ajde ( come on ) a million times a day , we eat traditional foods which other balkan states eat as well such as mussaka , gulash , baklava , trahana , burek , etc etc etc  we drink turkish coffee on a daily basis and share gossips at the same time . 
   we wear traditional costumes when we dance traditional dances ( costumes vary from region to region )  when we walk barefoot on the floor it means that we will get sick or our foot will grow longer  we 're not allowed to enter a house with shoes ( mostly in villages , i guess )  our mother 's weapons are a big spoon , a slipper , a vitsa ( punishment stick ) she 'll chase us around with these just to hit us when she gets mad . 
   we always get asked , when will you get married ? 
   i 've got a lot to tell you but i do n't have the time . 
   if someone from the balkan countries comes and visit us for s month he will see that we 're not that different , but similar so to answer your question , yes we are balkans too . 
  there are 12 balkan countries and we are the 12th . 
   hope i helped . 
  a few other users on that page also called greece a balkan country . 
  ** religion ** orthodoxy is not divided into sects like protestantism is . 
  the only difference between the greek orthodox church and the russian orthodox church is that one is based in greece and the other in russia . 
  literally that 's it , no theological differences . 
  ** geography ** do i even need to say anything here ? 
  an eastern european that does n't like being called eastern european , now that 's a surprise ... 
  i consider cold war greece to also be eastern european , but i excluded the cold war period because the east-west divisions back then were pretty clear cut . 
  and they were mostly based on non-communist and communist . 
  so calling greece east euro in that context would be weird . 
  greece is balkanish and the balkans are considered to be eastern europe . 
  it is a southeast european country . 
  it has much more in common with serbia or bulgaria than with italy or spain . 
  i do n't see how calling them eastern european is insulting . 
  it seems like you 're the one insulting eastern euros by treating their identity as if it were some sort of swear word . 
  are you saying that if the lib dems win , they will completely ignore the brexit referendum ? 
  could they really do that ? 
  how likely is a lib dem victory ? 
  wow , what a complete moron for having such a suggestion . 
  wonder what spurred him to come up with something like that . 
  eli5 : what is ftfp ? 
   as well as other loopholes such as ? 
  they 've been eastern europe for their entire existence with the exception of the cold war period . 
  were n't the original people of istria venetics and then the histri ( illyrians ) came later ? 
  them coming from the caucasus to the balkans is not a strong theory . 
  the caucasian theory goes like this : * caucasus --  central europe --  balkans and its only accepted by a small minority of people . 
  there 's also a theory like that about serbs as well saying they come from the caucasian * serboi * ( who came from afghanistan ) . 
  yeah , i 'm aware of the white croatia and white serbia theory .
