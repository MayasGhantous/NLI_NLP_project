  the `` croats are serbs descendents '' theory would go something like this : * white croatia = chakavian-speaking ( croat ) homeland * white serbia = shtokavian-speaking ( serb ) homeland so the shtokavian-speakers of croatia are of serb descent whereas the chakavian-speaking ones are the only croats descended from the white croatia population of original croats . 
  of course according to this theory , not all croats are of serb descent , only the majority would be . 
  and to reiterate ( yet again for those type of people ) , this just how the language theory would work and its not something i 'm claiming as fact . 
  okay , edited . 
  i 'm talking about before the schism . 
  etymyonline is a fairly reputable source . 
  one tiny mistranscription should n't make the stuff there invalid . 
  they 're also not the only website that have this theory . 
  their ethnicity being named after them being highlanders is not something improbable as other the etymologies of thr names of other ethnic groups such as burgundians and malayalis also means `` highlander '' . 
  anyways , i did some more searching on it and its likely that the word may not be ultimately of slavic origin but it came to croatian via proto-slavic but could have came to proto-slavic from another ie language . 
  [ etymonline ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=croat )  croat ( n. )  from serbo-croatian hrvat `` a croat , '' from old church slavonic churvatinu `` croat , '' literally `` mountaineer , highlander , '' from churva `` mountain '' ( compare russian khrebet `` mountain chain '' ) . 
  -- i 've also heard the theory of it coming from harauti ( arachosia ) , but this theory makes much more sense . 
  its not like i personally believe that each dialect ( shtokavian , kaykavian , chakavian ) belongs to each ethnicity . 
  i do not think that . 
  i know shtokavian is n't the language of the serbs , etc. 
  i just said that when talking about the origins of the ethnic groups , then they could have believed that back then that all shtokavian-speakers were one ethnicity ( serbs in this context ) , all chakavian-speakers were one ethnicity ( croats ) , etc. 
  so if you were to try to assign a dialect/language to one ethnicity under the assumption that * ethnicity ( pre-schism ) = language * , then you end up like that . 
  i do n't think it makes too much sense to assign a dialect to an ethnicity though . 
  again , i was n't making these claims myself . 
  i was just theorizing that maybe serb nationalists must have done that thus coming to the conclusion that language = ethnicity ( before the schism happened ) and then used that as a basis to claim most croats have a serb origin . 
  i said i was just giving my 2 cents . 
  i 'm not an expert on the region . 
  i was just saying why serbs might think that . 
  i do n't think that myself . 
  you can look at it this way . 
  language/dialect is largely correlated with nation . 
  and linguistic similarity represents the origins/common roots from where a nation originated . 
  * kaykavian/slovene = language of the slovenes * shtokavian = language of the serbs * chakavian = language of the croats so they probably used the analogy that people that speak a similar dialect are from the same root , and by that logic concluded that since serbs speak only shtokavian , that must mean most croats are of serb origin but tried to dissociate themselves from serbs because of the schism . 
  i 'm not saying this is sound logic or anything , but i am guessing this is where the theory originated . 
  it may sound silly and they may have different reasons for claiming croats , but anyways i 'm not an expert on the region , just giving my 2 cents . 
  * the name * croat * comes from an old slavic word meaning `` highlander '' . 
  * there are three main dialects/languages in croatia called shtokavian , chakavian , and kaykavian . 
  kaykavian is closer to slovene than to standard croatian ( which is based off dubrovnik 's dialect ) . 
  they decided with the serbs to base their standardized language off the same dialect to bring greater unity between croats and serbs against the austrians . 
  * dalmatian dogs come from croatia 's dalmatia region . 
  * a couple of croatian separatists hijacked a [ flight ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twa_flight_355 ) in ny on 9/10/76 , but nothing happened since the explosives there were fake and the only casualty what the death of one officer while disarming the explosive . 
  * oldest slavic alphabet called [ glagolitic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glagolitic_script ) was used there . 
  * has the highest amount of neanderthal fossils in a place called [ krapina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krapina ) . 
  * the ustasha ( who were said to be more cruel than the nazis ) , led by ante paveli\u0107 , were from there and cleansed croatia of most of its population of serbs , jews , and gypsies . 
  the reason bosniaks were spared was cause they claimed bosnia 's land so they needed bosniaks to be on their side and called them `` muslim croats '' and the `` flower of croatia '' . 
  the ss handschar ( which was composed of mostly bosniaks with some croats ) was from there and it was a division of germany 's waffen ss . 
  ~ ~ i think it was the only slavic division within the waffen ss . ~ ~ ante paveli\u0107 told hitler that croats were of gothic ( as opposed to slavic ) origin , which is why croatia and nazi germany cooperated . 
  * croats migrated from central europe at the same time as the serbs to the balkans in the 7th century . 
  tomislav was their first king . 
  * the bosnian frontier ( * bosanska krajina * ) used to be part of croatia . 
  then the ottomans occupied it in the 15th-16th century and it was called [ turkish croatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_croatia ) before getting its current name ` bosnian frontier ' . 
  then croats became a minority there after the ottomans killed them and migration from other parts of the ottoman empire occurred . 
  * the pre-slavic language of istria was venetic and the rest of of croatia spoke illyrian in pre-slavic times . 
  * they share the baranja region with hungary . 
  they also had a union with hungary for five centuries starting in the 11th century . 
  * the necktie is from there . 
  most of what the spanish did is n't either discussed in the us . 
  only stuff the spanish did that was relevant to the us is discussed . 
  for me it was also disabled until i manually enabled it a long time ago while tinkering around in the settings . 
  yeah , but i mean after that happened . 
  my original point was just that the eu is the one behind the `` us vs. them '' wedge whether its justified or not . 
  or do you think that the uk is the one that made statements that can be interpreted in an `` us vs. them '' manner ? 
   the article about scotland is if they vote to become independent they would be welcome back in . 
  as such is n't provocative at all . 
  this is encouraging independence since the majority of scotland is very pro-eu . 
  they should have just stayed silent . 
  maybe not about the gibraltar comment , but the eu did make those statements on [ ireland ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/merkel-most-encouraging-and-supportive-of-ireland-s-brexit-concerns-1.3040782 ) and [ scotland ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-scotland-germany-iduskcn0zc0qt ) . 
  the eu is the main provocateur here with their comments on ireland , scotland , and gibraltar . 
  every region in italy has a different culture and history . 
  the only thing unique about malta is it does n't speak a romance language ( even though maltese has a huge romance influence ) , although most maltese people are of sicilian descent . 
  no , he 's right . 
  it was called a dialect of italian even though it clearly is n't . 
  there was a discussion on it in / r/linguistics before . 
  how come venetian , sicilian , lombard , sardinian , etc. 
  have no official status in italy and are n't taught ? 
  do n't know why this sub supports overthrowing the yemeni government but are anti-intervention when it comes to syria . 
  hypocrites . 
  lol , luxembourg gets nothing . 
  the austrian places are in italian . 
  austria would stay 100 % german . 
  i know this is just meant as a joke/troll post , but its in very bad taste . 
  even i find it a bit offensive as a non-russian . 
  well , you guys both got upvoted for saying that . 
  yep , also germanics ( british , dutch , german ) are a relatively small ( but not tiny ) minority here by american standards and they are the tallest in the country . 
  there are significantly more south italians , hispanics , blacks , irish , and i 'd say even south asians here . 
  what would be considered tall in serbia for a man and woman ? 
  are 2 meter guys and 185 cm girls any bit common there ? 
  also , whats the diet there out of curiosity ? 
  my specific town has a slight black majority but the overall area is easily white majority . 
  i go outta town to malls and other places fairly frequently where whites are the easy majority and its the same case there . 
  although , most of the whites are south italians with some germans and irish as well . 
  i think the relatively short stature has to do with people here eating a lot of junk food and little dairy as well even though my county is the 13th richest county ( out of 3,000 + ) in the entire country . 
  a lot of immigrants ( a minority of whom are white as well ) too , but the vast majority of people 's parents were born here . 
  lucky : / well i was thinking of females more around 180 cm since thats above 175 cm . 
  although 175 is also very uncommon but not extremely rare like 180 . 
  for another reference , i 'm ~ 186 cm and have only seen a fairly small handful of guys at my uni taller than me . 
  average height for a guy here is probably 173 cm or so . 
  i 'm basically considered very tall here but probably slightly above average in serbia . 
  btw , this only applies to the new york metro area , i ca n't speak for all of usa . 
  its the maasai and/or tutsi i think . 
  i was comparing flanders and wallonia to netherlands and germany . 
   they also deeply desire to crush the tajiks . 
  how did you come to that conclusion ? 
  portugal being part of spain would be more similar to the netherlands being part of germany . 
  belgium is a pretty different thing .
