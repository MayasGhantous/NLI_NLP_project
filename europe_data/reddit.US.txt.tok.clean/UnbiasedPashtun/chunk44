   still , getting that is rare and ** does n't justify it ** . 
  true . 
  but to justify that , they say stuff like what i said above . 
  i was n't justifying it . 
  i think its bad . 
  i was just giving the reasoning that muslims give . 
  and obviously i do clean my junk ( if that was a serious question ) . 
  well its not the only reason . 
  it does greatly reduce the chwnce of getting penile cancer . 
  still , getting that is rare and does n't justify it . 
  i was just giving their reason . 
  how do you guys keep doing well in these ? 
  do they teach you american states in school or something ? 
  its not like circumcision is the only thing . 
  muslims also have to shave their pubes and pits and do ablution multiple times a day . 
   fun fact : in islam , man is allah 's creation and as such , is perfect . 
  so , the question comes to mind : why do they still `` modify '' children after birth ? 
  its done to increase cleanliness e.g. 
  circumcised men ca n't get smegma ( not saying i support this , i 'm just telling you why ) . 
  is it common for greeks to intentionally go suntanning like how people from northern countries do ? 
  i also never look at the boring us states map . 
  i just tried it and got a 50 % in 3:38 . 
  es from ** es ** tonia , la from ** la ** tvia , and li from ** li ** thuania . 
  100 % in 1:33 seconds . 
  i can pinpoint european countries better than i can american states :p, 
   in poland you have group of friends rather than segregation . 
  we do have some kind of jocks but they also mingle with smart people or goths . 
  same in the us . 
  there 's also a version of low german from the netherlands . 
  but that 's not really surprising since low german ( like frisian and dutch ) is a very much distinct language from standard high german ( unlike bavarian , ripuarian , etc ) . 
  what about uikipedia ? 
  also , [ ripuarian ( k\u00f6lsch ) ] ( https://ksh.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:houpsigk ) , [ palatinate ( p\u00e4lzisch ) ] ( https://pfl.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:haubdsaid ) , and [ pennsylvania german ] ( https://pdc.wikipedia.org/wiki/haaptblatt ) versions . 
  in my experience , many people get super triggered if you call anti-muslim folk as `` racist '' ( even if the discrimination may have racial undertones ) . 
  so i just did an ftfy to avoid that argument . 
  hatred against poles and lithuanians is considered racism but i wanted the same term to be referenced for both groups the op mentioned which is why i corrected that part as well . 
  why is that ? 
  not that its a bad thing , just curious . 
  replace ` white supremacism ' with ` nativism ' . 
  the same concept applies . 
   for example here in norway , most of the people that are ~ ~ racist ~ ~ bigoted towards muslims are ~ ~ racist ~ ~ bigoted towords poles and lithuanians as well ftfy ( before any pedants show up , as they always do ) . 
  ** edit : ** why the mass downvotes ?? 
  its inevitable people would have been crying about him calling anti-muslim sentiment as ` racist ' by saying muslims are n't a race , so i just said this to avoid that unnecessary pedantry . 
  what are indonesians like ? 
   forgot to comment this . 
  that 's bs . 
  the word `` deutsch '' originally means `` of the people '' and is the name of the language . 
  its the same with slavs . 
  they used slav ( meaning `` word '' ) to refer to people that they understood i.e. 
  familiar people of similar culture . 
  germanics used a variant of * deutsch * to refer to their own kin . 
  german was n't an ethnicity back then but it was a wider `` meta-ethnicity '' that included the franks , saxons , bavarians , english , etc. 
  which were all considered their own separate ethnic groups part of the wider german family . 
   the word itself is old , sure , but any usage related to a language , a country , or a certain group of tribes is from the 10th century or later , long after christianization . 
  it was collectively used by germanics to refer to themselves ( in contrast to slavs , celts , & romans ) for ages . 
  that 's why every germanic country ( minus england ) has a term for germany that is related to * deutsch * . 
  the scandinavian * tysk * was used by them to refer to themselves before , but then when the definition of germanic & german diverged , they created a new word for germanic people and used * tysk * to refer to germans . 
   and afaik the term has never included england or scandinavia . 
  they were called a variation of deutsch for a long time . 
  it meant `` of the people '' ( as you said ) , and `` the people '' was in reference to germanic peoples ( to contrast them with non-germanics ) . 
   middle easterners are afraid their way of living will be threataned by secular western influence . 
  europeans are afraid their way of living will be threatened by islamic influence . 
  it 's a natural thing for people with totally different understandings of how the world works to fear . 
  and my point is that the sentiment is the same in the us . 
  people here also sometimes talk about muslims wanting to change american culture cause of the stuff happening in europe . 
   the us is different in that there 's this obsession with race all the time . 
  i get that racism is an important issue to adress . 
  i also see benefits in thinking more about these issues on a day to day basis . 
  the issue is mostly cultural , but black and white are common descriptives used because they are convenient terms . 
  if you guys had a lot of black people , then it 'd be the same there . 
  black people face racism in many european countries . 
  it disingenuous to think only usa cares about race . 
   so i do n't see these issues as black and white ( pun intended ) . 
  but obsessing over race constantly ca n't possibly be the way to go in solving race relation problems . 
  that 's because your minorities are only middle eastern people who self-identify more by their religion . 
  here , black people and white people are referenced by their race ( cause that 's the closest identity they have to an ethnic group ) , but most other people ( mexicans , indians , etc ) are referenced by their ethnic/cultural group like in europe . 
   do i need to remind you that the balkans have a significant and historical muslim minority that has been here for hundreds of years ? 
  i never mentioned religion . 
  i said brown people . 
   and romania , for example , has a lot of new asians immigrants , mainly arabs and chinese . 
  not a comparable amount . 
  the only comparable minority ( excluding gypsies ) you guys have are the tatar minority who are almost fully assimilated . 
  that 's done to the benefit of a disenfranchised group . 
  there is mistreatment against blacks to a degree by cops , yes . 
  the place is n't perfect but still fairly tolerant . 
  we also have affirmative action ( diversity quotas ) . 
  do you have any examples of institutional racism ? 
  eastern europeans do n't even have racial diversity to begin with cause you guys are so against taking non-white immigrants . 
  i 've heard many cases of brown people ( including hispanics & brownish southern euros ) getting beat up in eastern europe . 
  and do i need to remind you about the gypsies ? 
   no , the distinction has always been there , at least in german . 
  not always . 
  the distinction appeared in the roman era . 
   one is a latin ( ? ), 
  word to describe a number of tribes , the other is a german ( ic ) word to describe the language . 
  exactly . 
  before germans had contact with the roman latin-speakers , the word * germanen * did n't exist in the german vocabulary . 
  by the way , did you know that the dutch used to call themselves * diets * and the english used to call themselves * theodish * before ? 
  those two terms are cognate to * deustch * in german . 
   germany does not have a closer relationship to germanic tribes than england or the netherlands or scandinavia has . 
  if you ignore politics and look at this from a solely ethnolinguistic perspective ; then the english , dutch , austrians , and scandinavians are all german subgroups .
