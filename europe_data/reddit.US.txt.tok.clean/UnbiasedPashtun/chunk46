  180 cm is considered somewhat tall for guys here and extremely rare for women . 
  12 may be more logical , but that would be if we completely switched our entire decimal system to a base 12 system . 
  but since the whole entire world ( including usa and the uk ) uses base 10 as a decimal system , that makes the metric system much more logical . 
   that 's fairly normal in north america . 
  europe too , judging by the responses . 
  since this got 14 upvotes , i have a feeling you 're not alone  many people just do n't want to admit it here . 
  i heard euros shower less than americans before : /, 
  is n't taig an anti-catholic/irish insult ? 
  i did n't know it was a name . 
  only if i moved there permanently , which i have no plans on doing . 
  there 's a difference between nation and country . 
  basques definitely are a nation but they are not a country . 
  and it seems scotland is not either a country after reading some other responses . 
  new jersey or new york might be a good match . 
  most are of nordic descent too . 
  i 'm from new york . 
  i do n't know really , but maybe france i guess ? 
  they have paris which is a global city on a similar scale to nyc . 
  we also have a coastline and mountains . 
  basketball is pretty popular . 
  both have a similar weather as well . 
  both are also fairly progressive as well . 
  and brussels would also go to the netherlands since it was originally dutch-speaking . 
  they are n't officially recognized as countries . 
  they just have country in their title . 
  how does the basque country have more autonomy than scotland ? 
  the basque country may have country in its name but its an autonomous province not a country . 
  wales , scotland , england , and northern ireland are all officially considered countries though . 
  those are all countries . 
  not independent countries but still countries . 
  [ yes . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roussillon ), 
  how ? 
  you guys also started saying * soccer * , but that did n't catch on in the uk . 
   kill kebab bosnia ? 
  poland 's current national flag has no coat of arms . 
  it looks like monaco 's flag . 
  would you prefer that to be poland 's flag instead since it does n't look as boring ? 
  what about keep the current flag but add a coat of arms in the middle ? 
  bosnia and kosovo too , except they have a tiny bit of white mixed in . 
  that 's not why they 're so widely supported . 
  i do n't see chechens , moros , pattani malays , uyghurs , etc. 
  get the same support as them . 
  yes , those groups do have some people that support them but their separatist actions are widely considered unforgivable terrorist attacks unlike that of the pkk 's which are common to see people defending . 
  just look at the worldnews threads regarding each of those groups . 
  the tibetan separatists and a few others are in the same group as the kurdish separatists because the west romanticizes them . 
  because kurds are romanticized in the west right now ( unlike turks and arabs ) . 
  english also uses that sound but only in one word , the word * ugh * . 
   also , bosnian muslims tend to be more communist than croats and serbs , in general . 
  why ? 
  what if you were just standing in line at a store or something and he started chatting you up ? 
  its really just a good way to pass time . 
  think of it like reddit but with real people rather than anons . 
  thanks for the writeup , 
   one of their first moves was to create an election and referendum system blatantly favoring them could you elaborate on what they did that made the system favor them ? 
  i 'm not arguing that brazil is more democratic than poland , but corruption perception = / = corruption . 
  its just perception of corruption , not actual corruption i.e. 
  its meaningless info . 
  so were lame and dumb . 
  true , but just saying that the us did n't change in classification ( on the democracy index ) after he was elected . 
   trump 's usa usa was a flawed democracy even before trump got elected . 
  fennoscandia ( except for the south ) , iceland , the scottish highlands , the northern part of russia , and maybe some of central spain . 
  is he an ethnic greek with a christian background ? 
  which country are you from ? 
  thanks . 
  how are you watching eurovision ? 
  do you have a link to the site ? 
  why do n't all the leftist anti-brexiteers ( like the ones from / r/uk ) vote for them ? 
  about 48 % of brits were against brexit . 
  surely a large portion of that 48 % would want the lib dems to win ? 
  or do they have party loyalty to labour or something ? 
  why are they polling so bad ? 
   you are far more likely to get murdered , raped or mugged in france than in my country france and poland seem to have a similar [ rape rate ] ( http://www.womanstats.org/vlbmaps/images1/weightedinternationalrape2011.jpg ) and [ homicide rate ] ( http://i.imgur.com/exnktps.jpg ) . 
   blacknecks what does that mean ? 
  bosniaks ? 
  there are n't national parks in poland ?

  okay , not the * exact * same word with the same exact spelling but they both basically mean `` czechia '' . 
  i 've heard that the distinction between bohemia and czechia in english was started by german nationalists in the 19th century ( german also has different names for bohemia and czechia ) and then it spread to english . 
  what about italian ? 
  what about kashubian ? 
  its obvious the op was referring to the language not the dialect of catalan specific to catalonia . 
  not really . 
  bohemia was the historic name of the entire country in english for centuries . 
  the people that live in moravia are mostly ethnic bohemians . 
  \u010cesko ( `` czechia '' ) is just how you say bohemia in the czech language . 
  the term czech is a loanword to english based on an archaic czech spelling ( i mean what kind of english word is spelled with < cz  ?? ) . 
  the england-uk and the netherlands-holland example does n't make sense here since those regions have different names in the native languages spoken there . 
  contrast to bohemia ( region ) and czechia ( country ) which are both called the same name in czech . 
  besides , moravia is just a historic region . 
  people living there mostly identify as ethnic bohemians/czechs . 
  i think we should have called it bohemia in english . 
  i know there is a region inside czechia called bohemia , but bohemia ( region ) and czechia ( country ) are the same word in czech so they can both be called the same name ( bohemia ) in english as well . 
  nah , we might annex canada though . 
  you should look up belgium then .

  the south is the least developed/progressive part of the us , making it the backwater . 
  yep , east germany would be a better equivalent to the american south . 
  the south is definitely more backwards than the mountain time zone .
