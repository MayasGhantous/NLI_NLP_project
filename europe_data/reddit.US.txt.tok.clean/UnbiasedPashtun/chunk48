   most of all might be how words like communism or socialism is like poison to most americans , but i guess that 's what 50 years of cold war and brain washing does to the majority of a country . 
  when we say socialism/communism , we 're talking about the garbage in cuba , venezuela , ex-warsaw pact , etc. 
  and i do n't see anything wrong with treating thise ideologies with contempt . 
   most of this goes for the midwest , south and la. 
  san fransisco and new york were pretty decent and i havent been to the northwest yet so i have n't formed an impression of people from there . 
  thanks  ( new yorker here ) which part of ny btw ? 
  just nyc ? 
  i have n't visited those other places so i ca n't exactly relate , but i still feel most of your `` americans are ignorant '' remarks apply to many nations in regards to their awareness on culturally distant countries . 
  did you notice a big difference between ny/sf and the rest of usa other than the fact ny/sf are less religious ? 
  yes . 
  if you click on his link , its based mostly on drug use . 
  when did you learn that ? 
  i 'm from america and never heard of it mentioned outside the internet . 
  what stupid stuff did they say that shocked you ? 
  imo , that mainly just applies to canadians and maybe some northerners from usa . 
   i dunno , anything !, 
  flee the country , organise massive protests , worker strikes , anything to show that american people are against the current system and it must go down !, 
  many of us actually are doing this . 
  in fact , i 'm going to a climate change protest all the way to the capital this saturday . 
  and there have been * many * more protests and strikes organized besides that . 
  you ca n't expect us to take arms against a democratically elected government . 
   european are really sick by this american exceptionalism , always claiming `` usa # 1 !, 
  '' , `` we 're the best country in the world '' . 
  i see it the other way around . 
  europeans talk about usa 's poor health care system , invading other nations , not using the metric system , being fat , being ignorant , etc. 
  some of these criticisms are justified to a degree but just saying that you see more `` we are better '' stuff coming from europeans ( except in the military department ofc ) . 
  i guess it was just an immature judgement of mine based on the strong anti-immigration stance in czechia , since that seems to be correlated with conservatism . 
  you guys are n't really conservative after all i guess . 
  why is he preferred to macron ? 
   by american standards , definitely , by european , not so much . 
  czechia is leftist by american standards ? 
  can you expand on why you think that ? 
  i 've always seen the v4 countries as fairly conservative compared to the us ( except in maybe religion ) , at least that 's the image that v4 countries have . 
   i also think that i 've reconfirmed by suspicions that while europe does share a culture , a lot of it is being lost to american neoliberalist culture . 
  what do you mean by this ? 
   the old high german diutisc , as in deutschland or tyskland . 
  actually , those all come from proto-germanic * \u00feiudiskaz . 
  french and italian speakers live in land that border lands where allemans live ( baden-w\u00fcrrtemberg , german-switzerland ) so they called all germans `` alleman '' since those were the germans that they had most contact with . 
  even though the italians call germany `` allemania '' , they call germans `` tedesco '' since that 's a name that survives from roman times ( used in reference to germanics ) during the germanic conquest of roman-britain . 
  the spanish got the name `` allemani '' from the french most likely since they do n't share a border with allemans . 
  the ethnic group/tribes that lived in the northern part of germany were the saxons . 
  the baltic-finns had the most contact with them and used their name to generalize all germans . 
  the slavic name for germany comes from the fact that german was completely unintelligible to them , so they called the germans `` niemcy '' ( or variant of that ) which means mute ( basically unintelligible in this context ) . 
  the other variants of german ( i.e. 
  tysk , etc. ), 
  are cognate to the modern german * deutsch * . 
  the ancestors of all germanic folk referred to themselves as a variant of this but with the passage of time , this came to only refer to continental west germanics ( excluding the dutch who developed a separate identity from germans when they were n't part of the hre ) . 
  these terms are derived from proto-germanic * \u00feiudiskaz * . 
  btw , even though the dutch call the germans * duits * , they never referred to their ancestors by that name ( they 're the exception to what i said above ) . 
  the name used to refer to germans in dutch is/was * duits * ( derived from * deutsch * ) whereas germanics were called * diets * ( derived from * \u00feiudiskaz ) . 
  yep , the italian word came from latin * theodiscus * and the latin word came from old english . 
  it would be * theedishland * . 
  * theetch * is just an anglicization of * dutch * ( as opposed to * deutsch * ) to differentiate between german and germanic in `` anglish '' . 
  the term * duetsch * would have been * theedish * since the original word was * \u00fee\u014ddisc * and the < e\u014d  evolved into < ee  as evidenced by * de\u014dr * evolving into * deer * . 
  the < \u00fe  was an archaic letter used for representing the < th  sound and the < sc  was the archaic way of writing < sh  . 
  so * deutsch * in modern english would have evolved into * theedish * if we did n't use the latin derived word * german * . 
  btw , the latin word * theodiscus * is a loanword from old english and a variant of it survives in italian . 
  would n't slavs had contact with thrakians , dakians , and/or illyrians ? 
  these tribes ' homelands border central europe ( which is where slavs live ) . 
  slavs also countered many uralic speakers ( especially hungarians ) . 
  do you have a link saying that * - ric * came from gaelic ? 
  i checked the etymology of the word and it said that it came from old english . 
  i think vampire came to english via hungarian . 
  * harem * is of arabic origin . 
  i ca n't believe you did n't mention immigration in your post . 
  i would say that the biggest reason she came so far is cause of her stance on immigration . 
   - in the 1800s the british colonized india . 
  they used a strategy called `` divide and conquer '' which meant that they would help certain local groups and leaders to gain their support against other indians . 
  during british rule india 's economical development plummeted as all the profit went to britain . 
  they did n't divide anything . 
  india was very divided by the time the british came and the british just helped certain groups against other groups . 
  the brits are actually the sole reason india exists as a united entity today . 
  if it were n't for them , then india would be 50 different countries today . 
  european stuff are more interesting/refreshing to read about . 
  interesting , thanks for the correction . 
  ( no i was n't referring to the comic book thor ), 
  thor is more of a pan-germanic entity than only a scandinavian/norse one . 
  human is a species not a race . 
  they used the word ancestry in the article , but they were talking about race ( caucasoid vs. negroid vs. mongoloid ) if you bothered to read the article . 
  i did n't say it was a scientific concept , just what a race was . 
  it is not some 18th century obsolete term like you may think though . 
  when finding skeletons , forensic scientists still classify the skeleton based on its race . 
  if you ever take a forensic science course , then you 'll need to know how to tell apart the different racial phenotypes . 
  race is more along the lines of skeletal structure , but yeah skin color is also correlated with it most of the time . 
  the second most famous from the uk would be yorkshire 's [ on ilkla moor baht ` at ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xusq9qs2dqo ) . 
  it makes sense to call them the same dialect because the standardized registers are based off the dubrovnik dialect . 
  there are some differences , but not anything big . 
  its like the american accent and canadian accent . 
   and macedonian and bulgarian are different languages . 
  only macedonians ( not all ) say this , but even if they are , my point was that macedonian and bulgarian are much more different to each other than serbian and croatian are . 
  polish apostates do n't get socially ostracized ? 
  i mean that standard serbian , standard croatian , standard bosnian , and standard montenegrin are all the same dialect . 
  macedonian and bulgarian are different dialects . 
  do some [ non-gaelic-speaking ] scots from the highlands also have that accent ? 
  what are some of his policy positions ? 
   horst seehofer what is he like ? 
  since he mentioned the midlands , its safe to assume that north in this context is the land north of the midlands and south of scotland . 
  i would say all of north germany is the original saxony rather than only lower saxony . 
  serbian and croatian are accents of the same dialect . 
  macedonian and bulgarian are dialects of the same language .
