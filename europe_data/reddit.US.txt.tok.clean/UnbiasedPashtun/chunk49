  hungarian ? 
  i think that languages are mostly linguistic . 
  they only become political in cases where there 's somewhat of a gray area between language and dialect . 
  tbh , the native dialects of austria are probably more distinct from standard german than czech and slovak are from each other , yet czech and slovak are considered different languages . 
  til those exist . 
  are the swedish-speakers of finland mostly ethnic finns that speak swedish or are they ethnic swedes ? 
  you guys feel closer to italians than to croats ? 
  are n't you guys very similar to ukrainians and especially lithuanians ? 
  if you divide central europe in half , then poland falls in the eastern half with other v4 countries whereas austria and germany fall in the western half . 
  are you sure ? 
  it was pronounced `` reach '' but because of the sound shift , it became `` rich '' . 
  the modern english term `` rich '' ( as in wealthy ) had the same spelling as `` ric '' in old english . 
  i included the source in one of the earlier comments . 
  `` rich '' is most definitely germanic . 
  do you have a source on it being reach ? 
  we speak `` standard american '' in new york though . 
  anglophones lisp the s when pronouncing the < th  in * thermal * . 
  yes . 
  also , the < th  in the word '' ** th ** at '' is a z-lisp whereas the < th  in '' ** th ** ink '' is an s-lisp . 
  did n't izhorians live in the general area before ingrians migrated there ? 
   edit : goddamn he was the other thing , see kids that 's what you get for believing in people he says that the dubrovnik dialect is part of eastern herzegovinian though . 
  is that wrong ? 
  i said france cause they had much more of a historical impact ( i.e. 
  normans , angevins , etc ) on the uk than the other countries you mentioned , so i assumed this might have lead to some cultural similarities ( especially considering your closer geographic proximity ) . 
  the countries you mentioned are germanic-speaking just like the uk mostly is , but there are more loanwords in english that come directly from french than from dutch and german combined . 
   and even netherlands , belgium ( flanders ) and germany do n't feel completely alien . 
  would n't you be closer to france than those countries ? 
   need to ban access to a huge amount of random areas . 
  can you clarify on this bit ? 
  i agree . 
  in a european sub , especially where the overwhelming majority support the eu , using the eu flair makes as much sense as using no flair at all . 
  i 'm guessing andorra uses the barcelona standard rather than its own localized version ? 
  before the russification of ingria ( where st. petersburg is ) , they spoke ingrian ( a finnish dialect ) since most people that lived there originally came from finland , however ingrian-finnish was not the native language there . 
  the native languages of ingria were izhorian and votic . 
  which part of castile ? 
  madrid ? 
  one more question . 
  did lutheran german have influence from other dialects besides upper saxon ? 
  i heard there was quite a bit of influence from thuringian and upper franconian . 
  thanks , that really cleared a lot of confusion i had . 
  do they still speak low saxon ( `` platt '' ) in hannover ? 
  i can understand flairs for overseas territories and places with a strong regional identity ( e.g. 
  regions of germany , spain , italy ) , but are some flairs like the olympic or red cross really necessary ? 
  what are they supposed to represent in a sub about asking europeans questions ? 
  btw , the faroe islands flag is not there . 
  also , i 'd just like to add that i love the designs of the flairs in this sub compared to / r/europe which has tiny pixelated flags . 
  did n't hannoverish folk adopt standard german first ( which was a mix of mostly upper saxon , thuringian , & upper franconian ) and then standard high german was based off the adopted hannoverish dialect ? 
  i 've heard a few times that they have the cleanest dialect because standard high german was based off the dialect there . 
  i think spain is tolerant of muslim refugees because the number of muslim refugees there is small . 
  and since its small , they are easier to integrate . 
  every country that recieves a lot of refugees ( irrespective of if the refugees are muslim ) has a lot of people that complain . 
  not even with the solidarit\u00e4tszuschlag ? 
  is n't the lisp only an andalusian thing ? 
  i 've heard standard french referred to as `` parisian french '' several times . 
  i said it was a cognate , not a currently used word though . 
  you are correct that this is not the case right now , but i just thought it 'd be interesting to note that english has a cognate to those words . 
  we ca n't use it in the real word ( although it would be nice to ) , but i was sorta just sharing a fun fact . 
  from an earlier reply :  anyways , i realize that since its not used anymore in english , so this statement is n't all that relevant , but i just thought it 'd be interesting to point out that english has its own version of * rige * . 
  as a whole though , the west is much richer . 
  the term * reich * also means `` rich '' in german according to google translate . 
  we could revive the term `` rich '' so that we could use it in place of * reich * . 
  it was used in old english after all . 
  anyways , i realize that since its not used anymore in english , so this statement is n't all that relevant , but i just thought it 'd be interesting to point out that english has its own version of * rige * . 
  according to [ this article ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/10/31/the-berlin-wall-fell-25-years-ago-but-germany-is-still-divided/ ) , the economic divide is still alive and well . 
  how much longer do you think until east germany can become west germany 's equal ( or close to equal ) in development/wealth ? 
  yes , but back when it was chosen to become standard french , it was considered a dialect back then . 
  that second map is very interesting . 
  are all the finnic dialects in estonia part of a single dialect continuum ? 
  * reich * is a 20 century loanword in english ( if we consider it english ) . 
  english actually has its own cognate to * reich * and * rige * , its '' [ rich ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rich ) '' . 
  not the eastern herzegovinian dialect ? 
   the eastern herzegovinian dialect ( / \u02cch\u025b\u0259rts\u0259\u0261\u0259\u02c8vi\u02d0ni\u0259n , \u02cch\u025c\u02d0r - , - \u0261o\u028a - , - \u02c8v\u026a - / , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] serbo-croatian : isto\u010dnohercegova\u010dki / \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0445\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438 or isto\u010dnohercegova\u010dko-kraji\u0161ki / \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0445\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0447\u043a\u043e-\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0458\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0438 ) is the most widespread subdialect of the shtokavian dialect of serbo-croatian , both by territory and the number of speakers . 
  ** it is the dialectal basis for all modern literary serbo-croatian standards : bosnian , croatian , serbian , and montenegrin ( the latter only partially codified ) . 
  ** [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_herzegovinian_dialect ), 
  interesting , i heard that belgian dutch people refer to standard dutch as * hollands * ( `` hollandish '' ) so i assumed it must have been based on the amsterdam dialect . 
  any idea why antwerp 's dialect would have been chosen ? 
  is n't the prince 's flag nowadays a symbol of greater netherlands ( i.e. 
  annexing flanders ) ? 
  how are you supposed to become fluent in it with the little resources available ? 
  i can understand studying it but fluency seems a bit impractical . 
  do fluent speakers of sumerians even exist ? 
  are you studying sumerian or actually trying to become fluent in the language ? 
  how 'd you come up with those names . 
  what does `` rp '' stand for ? 
  plattdeutsch is closer to dutch and frisian than standard high german . 
  is that how its pronounced ? 
  `` native american '' is too broad of a term . 
  lacrosse was always just a sport played by the iroquois and maybe a few neighboring tribes . 
  it was never a thing outside the northeast and bordering parts of canada . 
  it is not `` now largely ignored '' . 
  lacrosse is the fastest growing sport in america : [ 1 ] ( https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/lacrosse-fastest-growing-sport?utm_term=.oswmmvzny#.jmjk3k7ey ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.boston.com/sponsored/2016/04/12/lax-attack-lacrosse-continues-explode-across-sports-landscape/qen7fy443eumkibufp2fpo/story.html ) [ 3 ] ( http://blog.connectlax.com/2016/11/30/5-reasons-why-lacrosse-is-the-fastest-growing-sport-in-america/ ) [ 4 ] ( http://www.insidelacrosse.com/article/lacrosse-leads-ncaa-participation-growth-demographic-data/33274 ) [ look at this map of how rapidly lacrosse has spread since 2005 .

  what about the duchy of bavaria ? 
  not rafael nadal ? 
  never mind , i thought you were trying to say that the region was originally slav or something . 
   then when frankish tribes settle in gaul , we consider them as our ancestors too . 
  franks barely lived in france though . 
  it was mostly just the ruling elite that was frankish but frankish tribes would have been like less than 1 % of the population . 
   what exactly is an ethnic german though ? 
  even in the 40s and 30s the germans already had mixed with the french and the poles etc. . .
