  or is that the same as the ruhr area since it includes it ? 
  which country are you from ? 
   it is three different countries . 
  actually four . 
  i 'm guessing the only people that play cricket in sweden are a few south asian immigrants ? 
  basketball is a winter sport so its only real competition is rugby . 
  in usa , basketball competes with american football , so basketball can work there like it did in france ( which also plays rugby ) . 
  interesting if true . 
  in the recent u-18 europe championship last year , britain could n't even qualify with 16 slots available . 
  lets hope the current 11-15 year old generation is the start of something big . 
  how is volleyball doing ? 
  you guys seem like you have great potential as a basketball playing country . 
  its a shame the sport is not popular there . 
  nice music , i for one really liked it . 
  south african is not an ethnicity . 
  it just means you have south african citizenship . 
  same with the term american . 
   whether they like it or not they 're more irish than british in my eyes at least . 
  even the protestants who are mostly of british descent ? 
  breton and welsh are sister languages . 
  it has more to do with culture than geography . 
  austria is a germanic country with historical ties to italy , france , germany , and the netherlands . 
  they have very little association with a lot of eastern europe comparatively . 
   the portuguese diaspora is huge in luxembourg city . 
  why ? 
  half of middle europe is in eastern europe and half in western europe . 
  visgred countries = middle-eastern europe, 
  whats his name ? 
  what are some stuff he said ? 
  you guys have recently been getting a lot of foreign-born and 1st generation muslims to make up for those 3rd/4th-generation ones . 
   religion in europe is struggling as it is islam is n't struggling though . 
  true in some cases , but not true in many others . 
  where do you think the name france/frank came from ? 
  france 's name was originally gaul . 
  from croatia though . 
  the op is asking about people from countries not people from ethnic groups . 
  why charlemagne for germany ? 
  he was a salian frank ( like people from the netherlands/flanders ) . 
  what about reuters ? 
   most people say usa as in u-s-a , ** pronouncing the letters individually ** . 
  everybody that says usa pronounces the letters individually afaik . 
  well better late than never . 
  lateness can be an issue but the concept of their existence is good . 
  yes , switzerland too . 
  would you want one ? 
  and then have it replace standard austrian german ? 
  by bavarian , i meant bairisch . 
  what about a union within the eu of west germanic countries rather than just benelux ? 
  why ? 
  i do n't see what 's wrong with what they do . 
  they take non-french words and bend them around a bit so that its more suitable for the french language . 
   but do n't make austrians use the german words . 
  let them be their own nation . 
  what do you think about replacing german with a standardized bavarian as your national language ? 
  the * - y * suffix in english is of old english ( germanic ) origin , so i 'm fine with ungary . 
  ungarland does n't sound either but since we have the * - y * suffix , i 'd rather not change it . 
  for dutch , ongari\u00eb seems good since its closer to hongarije in pronunciation than ongarenland . 
  ongarenrijk seems unnatural to randomly give any country since very few have it ( i can only think of oostenrijk & frankrijk ) . 
  that 's dumb , its erasing a part of your language 's history . 
  i think its because of polandball 's popularity . 
  but most countries ( in europe at least ) have a dominant language that shapes the identity of the country with the other languages being minority languages . 
  belgium otoh is just a combo of two different cultures . 
  madyar is closer to the original pronunciation than magyar is , but the name hungarian is fine for english . 
  although i 'd prefer if we said `` ungarish '' in english . 
  the * - ian * and < h  are both latin additions . 
  a softer version of the < dg  in bri ** dg ** e  combined with a < y  ? 
  hungarian and finnish are related in the same sense that russian and english are related . 
  i guess i got the kull mixed up then . 
  i saw it on [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kull ) . 
  by saxon , are you referring to low german ( the original saxon language in north germany ) or are you referring to the dialect in upper saxony ? 
  they speak sorbian/lusatian there . 
  silesian is only spoken in poland and czechia . 
  the polish voivodship of lower silesia ( dolno\u015bl\u0105skie ) borders upper saxony , but the region was not originally silesian speaking but was named silesia after wwii . 
  in lower silesia , they mostly speak standard polish with a tiny portion speaking sorbian . 
  is n't standard italian based off of tuscan ? 
  i would have thought that it would sound the most familiar to you . 
  i 'm guessing you can understand luxembourgish without any difficulty then as well ? 
  saxon ( low german ) is not really a german dialect . 
  saxon and dutch are very similar , but dutch and high german are very different . 
  in germany , all native germanic languages are considered dialects of german and its speakers ethnic germans . 
  frisian ( saterlandish , north frisian ) and meuse-rhenish ( dutch ) are both considered german dialects and its speaker ethnic germans according to germany . 
  all germanic languages were originally dialects of the same language . 
  which only are you from ? 
  i 've always heard of rounders being seen as a girls sport in britain . 
  it came to estonian via finnish and to finnish via scandinavian . 
  it comes from old norse * kol * from proto-germanic * kul\u0105 . 
  i always understood it like this : * castilian = language * andalusian = dialect so saying that andalusian and castilian are separate stuff threw me off a bit . 
  but i am totally aware of the differences betwee castilian in the castilian plateau and castilian in andalusia . 
  how widely spoken are native bavarian dialects in austria ? 
  i heard that they were dying since there is 0 promotion of them in the media or education . 
  is there a standardized asturian ? 
  are n't the andalusian dialects considered to be part of castilian ? 
  so a pole from weilkopolska can easily understand what a pole from podlaskie is saying ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  for a tiny country like slovenia , i would have thought that everywhere the dialect would be only slightly different . 
  why are you using < \u00e5  when writing tyrolian ? 
  why is poland so religious compared to other central european countries ? 
  okay , i see . 
  another question or two . 
  in the [ map of baltic tribes ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg/800px-baltic_tribes_c_1200.svg.png ) you posted earlier , where are the latvians ?
