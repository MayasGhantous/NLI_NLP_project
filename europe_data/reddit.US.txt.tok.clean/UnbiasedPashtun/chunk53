   nobody cares if anyone is native . 
  terms like european , african , etc. 
  on census forms are implied to be referring to native european , native african , etc. 
  if you 're a white south african , then you are still african , but in a separate category from native africans . 
  when we discuss terms like african , european , etc. 
  we are talking about in reference to people 's ** origins ** aka `` nativeness '' . 
  in terms of origins , most us americans are not native american so our origins are n't american . 
  we only call ourselves american because of our nationality . 
  anyways , the americas is not really a good example here because natives are a minority so the term american is de facto associated with people of colonial descent . 
  just like how arabs living in europe are not native and whites living in america are not native , the whites living in africa are not either native . 
  the only natives of africa are sub-saharans and north africans . 
  white africans are n't native to africa . 
  they 're of european origin . 
  they 're in a separate category to nas and ssas . 
  why are women aged 20-29 taller than women aged 16-19 ? 
  women stop growing in their teens afaik . 
  i would expect the 16-19 group to be slightly taller if anything since they are younger and grew up in a healthier environment . 
  what is the quality of the french basketball league ? 
  in the us , most italians are from south italy ( mostly sicily ) where blonde people are not that common . 
  so when you compare the average sicilian with the average white ( english/german ) american , then stereotypes like those pop up . 
  the republic of herzeg-bosnia included a lot of bosniak majority regions and was only a short term thing . 
  how come croatia did n't try to get a republic consisting of only the croat majority regions like the serbs did ? 
  the term african is just talking about origins . 
  white africans are of recent non-african origin and black europeans are of recent non-euro origin so i do n't like those examples . 
  the only issue i have with the term african-american is it excludes north africans even though the term african originally referred to nas only and they 've been living in africa for several thousands of years . 
  if black people called themselves sub-saharan american or something along those lines , then i would n't see an issue with it . 
  you have to keep in mind that the terms white and black are extremely vague so that 's why some may prefer [ regional origin ] - american rather than a color . 
  in my experience in ny , most would say they were part-german or of german ancestry , but would n't call themselves straight-up german . 
  this was the case for all the ones i met except for like 2 or so people because their ancestors recently came from germany ( one of them even spoke german ) . 
  how come croatia does n't try to claim the croat regions of b&h like serbia tries to claim srpska ? 
  i do n't like the term african-american used as a synonym for black either , but mainly because it denies the existence of north africans . 
  blacks may not feel a connection to africa , but the african part is mainly used in reference to their origins irrespective of that . 
  its done the same with all americans . 
  the term was coined and embraced by black americans for themselves which is why its used . 
  americans of germanic ancestry rarely bring it up since it was so distant in the past . 
  but americans of italian and irish heritage is a whole different thing since they came from there relatively recently . 
  but you 're making it sound like mentioning serb war crimes is redundant because americans should know about it . 
  maybe in the 90 's , people who followed the news closely knew about it . 
  but if you ask an american on the street anything about serbia , you 'd be lucky if they could name where serbia is . 
  usa helped kosovo separate from serbia but its rare to meet an american that knows kosovo exists . 
  i agree there was anti-serb propaganda in the us but the average american is still oblivious to the whole thing . 
  what does * keleti * refer to ? 
  west asians or east asians ? 
  most americans have 0 knowledge on serbia tbh . 
  try talking with them about kosovo or srebrenica and they 'll look at you like you 're speaking gibberish . 
  although , american redditors ( especially on subs like these ) tend to be a bit more informed on the matter . 
   i consider russia european , but i do n't consider it the usual type of european , same goes for belarus , yes it 's in europe but it 's different than most of us . 
  so eastern european ? 
  really ? 
  russia is totally alien to asia . 
  the part of russia that is geographically in europe is where the vast majority of russians live , where ethnic russians live , where the russian ethnogenesis happened , etc. 
  what about russian mentality/culture is asian ? 
  would you also call ukrainian and belarusian mentally/culturally asian countries if russia is one ? 
  because russia has much more in common with those countries than with china or iran or india or malaysia . 
  how religious are people there ? 
  have you seen wolves ? 
  which country are you from ? 
  trump \u2260 us administration . 
  both mike pence and james mattis are important figures in the us administration and are very critical of russia . 
  the name for all romance speakers was wallach/vlach/vlah in eastern europe . 
  the wallachs living outside romania are not necessarily related to romanians . 
  yes , i 'm aware of all that . 
  i never said that macedonians were n't greek . 
  the name alexander is also of greek origin . 
  and are the immigrants disproportionately over represented in crime and not integrated ? 
   i live in sweden and i feel that the recent right-wing trend across the world has led to a lot of people fetishizing our culture in order to create the narrative that `` sweden used to be a paradise with no flaws , but now it 's a shithole . 
  so sad . '' . 
  i just want to clear out that the reason many americans think like that is because most swedes on the internet tend to be right-wing like that angry foreigner guy on youtube and this is what they tell americans and other foreigners . 
  its not some opinion that came out of thin but one that came from swedes themselves . 
   and god forbid if they knew about our `` progressive '' immigration policies . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  according to most of what i read on reddit , norway has a very lax immigration policy but is better than sweden , which lets in anything with a pulse . 
  i did n't say it was . 
  alexander was a greek macedonian from greek macedonia , not from the modern state ( republic of macedonia ) . 
  is that pic exaggerated ? 
   i think they know only two foreign countries - usa and japan . 
  i 'm pretty sure that they 'd know all the countries that border them ... 
  they do n't deny alexander was macedonian , but they say he was greek as well and that macedonians are a greek subgroup . 
  the historic name of the region was paeonia . 
  they could change the name to paeonia and lay claim on paeonian history/identity and no one would care . 
  alternatively , they could rename the country after the vardar river as well . 
  its not taught in the us at all . 
  its just something i found about on the internet . 
  the language is called spanish not hispanic . 
  do they teach you that the rus ' were of varangian origin and about the viking conquest of parts of the british isles and north america ? 
  also , do most swedes know they 're of germanic origin . 
  since the two biggest parties are dutch nationalist , then why has n't flanders left belgium yet ? 
  do they advocate for an independent flanders or greater netherlands ? 
  `` if we ca n't have it then neither can you ! '', 
  maybe a tiny portion of north california and the alaskan panhandle , but certainly not a significant portion let alone the whole state . 
  what about friesland ? 
   a small ethnic group who speak their own weird language ** s ** ftfy . 
  scotland has two languages , scots and gaelic . 
  agreed . 
  it 'd be better if the us and canada united . 
  no , but if a rival country supports the disintegration of your country , then it says a lot about whether its good or not . 
  cascadia is a bioregion with specific states in mind , california would n't be joining it . 
  how is it a gray area ? 
  secession is illegal and less than 5 % want it anyways . 
  then he could have just simply said irish .
