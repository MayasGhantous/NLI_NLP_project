  it comes from the native brythonic word * pretan * . 
  although i 'm not sure if pretan included ireland , but the brythonics referred to their land/nation as cymru ( or a derivative of that ) so it might have . 
  someone can clarify if i 'm wrong . 
  not saying i agree with the term ` british isles ' , but iceland is culturally nordic and a hop away from greenland ( in fact the majority of iceland is part of the north american tectonic plate ) . 
  it does n't make sense to group iceland with great britain , ireland , and the rest of that archipellago . 
  [ here you go .

  a lot are also native without european blood . 
  in the ussr , everyone became soviet . 
  in the post-ussr period , everyone became russian ( nationality ) but still distinguished from russian ( ethnicity ) . 
  literal ( or close to literal ) interpretation of the bible . 
  what did rutte say ? 
  `` european christianity '' is not a religion . 
  christianity is a religion . 
  europeans do n't practice proper christianity so you ca n't use that as evidence to put christianity in a positive light . 
  `` modern christianity '' is not a religion . 
  christian countries are advanced in spite of christianity , not because of christianity . 
  you 're acting had christianity had any remote influence on the positive aspects of european culture . 
  a couple of balkan countries like albania , serbia , bosnia , bulgaria , and romania do n't either deny being eastern european . 
  do you consider bosniaks to be slavs ? 
  are n't the percentage of moldovans that identify as ethnic romanian increasing in every census ? 
   why do you talk about south slavic when ukrainian is eastern ? 
  i mentioned south slavic languages because they use the exact same word * krajina * just like ukrainian . 
  i 'm also familiar with * krajina * being used to refer to frontiers by south slavs e.g. 
  * bosanska krajina * whereas i know nothing about polish or their usage of the word . 
  i mentioned east slavic languages as well ( russia 's usage of * krai * ) . 
  [ what do you think about this link btw ? 
  ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/2014/10/19/rename-russia-muscovy-some-ukrainians-say/ ), 
  i forgot to add the word `` of '' in my reply , fixed it . 
  but i still do n't get what you mean . 
  not having a real language to speak of ? 
  you 're saying that as if polish was their original language . 
  muscovy was just the name of the grand duchy , the people did n't refer to themselves as `` muscovites '' . 
  i thought you guys considered russian and rus ` ian completely distinct terms ? 
  gudai is an exonym , not an endonym . 
  before lithuania annexed belarus , they called themselves russian/ruthenian/ruski / etc ( whichever term you prefer ) . 
  they started calling themselves litvin after annexation . 
  i put a question mark because i was n't sure if novgorod was the most important city or not . 
  the origins of the word * krajina * comes from it meaning borderland . 
  in old east slavic ( language of rus ' ) , it meant borderland . 
  nah , i believed you after your first reply . 
  i was just stating where i heard the blood feuds . 
  i 'll find the link later . 
  you would n't call any land in the center of your country as `` krai/krajina '' though . 
  i 've only seen it referred to borderlands . 
  there was an / r/askeurope thread about it and that was a common answer ( blood feud ) . 
  why did albanian immigrate at aich higher rate than neighboring countries ? 
  thanks for the info , just two stuff i find questionable in what you said :  the population of novgorod was much less than that of kyiv , even less than of cities like belgorod ( 10km from kyiv , destroyed by the mongols ) . 
  meaning of the word `` ukraine '' is arguable . 
  ukrainian official version is that it means `` in land '' , literally from `` u krajina '' the term * krajina * ( * krai * in russian ) is used in south slavic languages and it means frontier/borderland e.g. 
  * bosanska krajina * ( bosnian frontier ) and * krasnodar krai * ( krasnodar frontier ) . 
  why do you think it means `` land '' ? 
   nobody here ever considered themselves ethnic russian . 
  do n't confuse the term `` ruthenian/rusyn '' and `` russian '' . 
  those are not directly related . 
  they all come from the same word ( rus ' ) and historically referred to the same people . 
  the distinction seems to be because of politics . 
   word ` russia ' was coined in early xviii by piotr i. rus ' is much early construct so referring to kyivan rus ' as ` old russia ' is misleading . 
  its still basically the same word . 
  rus ' , russia , and ruthenia are all cognates . 
  one is just a more modern version of the name . 
  if rus ' and russia are distinct terms , then [ how do you explain this ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/2014/10/19/rename-russia-muscovy-some-ukrainians-say/ ) ? 
   it 's like koreans , japanese , and chinese . 
  those ethnic groups do n't share a common origin unlike ukrainians and russians . 
  i guess bosnia is inflated by the serbs going to serbia and croats going to croatia . 
  i 'm very shocked by albania , nearly half their country is gone . 
  moldova is around half as bad and its poorer and it neighbors a wealthier country with the same language . 
  i guess its because of blood feuds , but 38 % is a very high number . 
  serbia is lower than i would have expected especially when you look at the countries it neighbors . 
  portugal 22 % vs. spain 2 % :o, 
  it also sounds like * pal\u0101w * , the pashto word for a lamb rice dish . 
  do any romanians care about losing bukovina and bujak to them ? 
  the crimean tatars are n't exactly indigenous . 
  they just came there before the slavs did . 
  it was n't `` created '' by germany , but germany supported ukrainian independence to keep away from russia . 
  * ukraine means frontier/borderland because it was the frontier of rus ' ( old russia ) , which is known by historians as kievan rus ' . 
  novgorod was the biggest city in kievan rus ' ( ? 
  ) , but kiev was its capital . 
  rus ' was founded by the rurik dynasty who were of swedish origin . 
  * after the mongols invaded rus ' , the plc annexed ukraine and belarus where most of modern-day ukraine became part of poland and belarus became part of lithuania . 
  within the plc , ukrainians and belarusians were collectively referred to collectively as `` ruthenians '' ( based on ruthenia which was the latin name for rus ' ) in history books . 
  * after some period of plc-influence , ukrainians and belarusians stopped considering themselves ethnic russians whereas the muscovites continued to see themselves as ethnic russians since they were n't occupied by the plc. 
  * [ i feel like this map is slightly misleading , but ukraine was originally smaller than it currently is . 
  ] ( http://www.sotirovic.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ukraine-imperialism.jpg ) ukraine , before losing crimea , was at its largest territorial extent ever . 
  it is currently the second largest country in europe . 
  * some ukrainian subgroups are hutsuls , lemkos , boykos , and rusyns . 
  * the ukraine/russia border region is where proto-indo-european originated . 
  * the ukrainian language is closer to belorussian than to russian . 
  west polesian is the transitional dialect between ukrainian and belarusian . 
   67 % i thought that right-wingers cared more about jewish safety rather than spreading muslim-hate ? 
  how come greece still has turkish muslims in thrace but turkey has no greek christians ? 
   `` nazivergleich '' who are they ? 
  i 'm from the us and i start by looking at germany . 
  that sucks . 
  hope it gets overturned soon . 
  when 's the earliest that the uk can rejoin the eu ? 
   czechian ah , i was wondering how long it would take till i would see this word after the term czechia became official :p, 
  if your great-grandfather was the only greek line in your ancestry , then that only makes you 1/8th greek by descent . 
  how are you supposed to call yourself greek based off of only that ? 
  or are you trolling ?
