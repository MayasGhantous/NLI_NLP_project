  well , muslims are becoming more religious each day and there 's an increase in muslims wearing hijabs . 
  i feel like wearing a hijab and doing other islamic stuff makes them more observant , and radical . 
  so banning the hijab or limiting religious freedom to some degree will make them less observant and more likely to integrate . 
  there is n't an integration or religious radicalism problem with sikhs , so its different . 
  cause they 're brainwashed into wearing it . 
  just cause they wear it out of choice does n't mean its not a symbol of oppression . 
  in the us , a president can only hold two terms of 4 years each . 
  and trump has only won one term , compared to erdogan who has been here for a while . 
  they 're not comparable . 
  i meant that turks do n't use them being infidels as justification for the genocide , i was n't talking about you . 
  why are you using words like kafir and infidel ? 
  it just makes it seem like muslim and non-muslim are two equally separate and distinct categories promoting an us vs. them mentality . 
  as someone unfamiliar with what they did , can you give a quick briefing on why you think it was their fault ? 
  what opinion do bosniaks have of croats generally speaking ? 
  is it comparable to the bosniak opinion of serbs ? 
  also , i 've heard that many bosniaks do n't consider themselves slavs . 
  is this true to any extent ? 
  he sounds like one of those butthurt people from the youtube comments section . 
  what a freaking pm . 
   german word form deutch derived from ancient teute not true . 
  both * deutsch * and * teut * share a common origin but one is n't derived from the other . 
  * deutsch * comes from proto-germanic * \u00feiudiskaz * . 
  this proto-germanic term shares a root with * teut * since both come from pie * teuta - . 
   germans are calling them sachsen , while the endonym they used for themselves was soxen . 
  not true . 
  the german * sachssich * traditionally referred to low germans from altsachsen ( north germany ) . 
  the germans of romania are high-german speakers originally from rhineland so they are not saxons . 
  i 've never heard about soxen being an endonym , if it is then likely a recent one . 
  was n't it the name of a celtic tribe ? 
   old german ( ? ), 
  rdfd ? 
  donald t. wins again !, 
  [ lithuanian is said to be the closest living language to proto-indo-european . 
  ah okay , well i said central european cause i was specifying poles/czechs/etc . 
  as opposed to east slavs . 
  the term eastern european includes east slavs . 
  where are the latvians ? 
  yeah , although some balkan slavs and central europeans like to play along with the meme anyways . 
  what about the holocaust ? 
  its a meme based off what russian gopniks wear and is mainly attributed to east slavs ( russians , belorussians , ukrainians ) . 
  i 've heard from slavs from the balkans & central europe that the `` squatting slav '' meme is n't really a thing there . 
  shtokavian is the native language spoken in serbia , montenegro , bosnia , and parts of croatia . 
  the standardized forms of serbian , montenegrin , bosnian , and croatian are based on a shtokavian dialect . 
  goranis are a muslim slavic ethnic group that live in the southern tip of kosovo ( as seen in the map above ) . 
  they are the only ethnicity that predominantly speaks torlak as a native language . 
  i think torlak is understood fairly well by bulgaro-macedonian speakers and shtokavian speakers . 
  so it is n't exactly a language in its own right but a group of dialects that serve as a transition between shtokavian and bulgaro-macedonian . 
  torlaks are n't an ethnic group but a dialect grouping . 
  they identify as ethnic serb , croat ( karasovan ) , bulgarian , macedonian , and gorani . 
  goranis are the only ethnicity that predominantly speak torlak . 
  serbs , bulgarians , etc. 
  contain torlak speakers but predominantly speak either shtokavian or bulgaro-maedonian . 
  torlak is the transitional language/dialect grouping between shtokavian and bulgaro-macedonian . 
  were n't you guys bitter with the brits up until the mid-1900 's or so ? 
  why not recognize the genocide a few years after you guys gained independence ? 
  yeah , the name of the country is the russian `` federation '' so they might as well federalize the country . 
  what massacre on a sunday ? 
  how common are east germans with thise views ? 
  like 5 % of east germany 's population ? 
  is this officially classified as a genocide ? 
  proto-celtic originated in the hallstatt culture of modern day austria . 
  how well can you understand griko ? 
  they do n't sound similar and have no mutual intelligibility , but there is a relationship between finnish and hungarian , although the relationship is very distant . 
   i mean , just yesterday a polish mep went on a sexist tirade . 
  who ? 
  what 'd he say ? 
   what would you suggest it be called ? 
  what is mark rutte like ? 
  what minority are you from ? 
  bosniaks and serbs have no problem communicating with each other in their own mother tongues , there are just a few different words because of localization . 
  standard serbian , croatian , bosnian , and montenegrin are based on the same dialect of shtokavian . 
  saying they are different languages is like saying that british and american are different languages . 
  how likely is it for fillon to make it to the next round ? 
  there is no bosnian language though . 
  the bosniak identity is older than their conversion to islam . 
  no , he 's lying . 
  slave is ` abeed ' and black is ` aswad ' . 
   meanwhile , the un ignores racism going on in africa , and religious discrimination in the middle east . 
  not exactly true . 
  here are some condemnations from the un on the issue : [ 1 ] ( http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsid=50188#.wlzas_nytpy ) [ 2 ] ( http://webtv.un.org/watch/the-persecution-of-christians-globally-a-threat-to-international-peace-and-security/4181653940001 ) [ 3 ] ( https://aclj.org/persecuted-church/testifying-at-the-united-nations-defending-persecuted-christians-from-isis-genocide ) [ 4 ] ( https://theinternationalscope.com/2016/06/09/the-united-nations-christian-persecution-widespread-and-systematic/ ) [ 5 ] ( http://news.ca.bahai.org/irans-human-rights-record-condemned-united-nations ) [ 6 ] ( https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11840.doc.htm ) [ 7 ] ( http://www.franceonu.org/ministerial-debate-attacks-on ) [ 8 ] ( https://www.censorbugbear.org/farmitracker/reports/view/4512 ) [ 9 ] ( https://mg.co.za/article/2008-05-31-un-racism-expert-condemns-sa-violence ), 
  racist incidents are a minor problem due to the country being homogeneous , but many racists exist there . 
  the word for black in arabic is ` aswad ' and the word for slave is ` abeed ' . 
  you can see this in sudan 's name . 
  the plural of ` aswad ' is ` sauda ' . 
  i did n't mean how the modern country montenegro separated from serbia , but how the montenegrin identity started to diverge from the serb identity . 
  even during the days of yugoslavia , there were many montenegrins that did n't consider themselves serbs which is why montenegro was n't part of serbia proper . 
  how did the whole separation of montenegro from the rest of serbia begin ? 
  montenegrins are of serb origin but less than a third consider themselves serb . 
  according to the cia world factbook , 45 % of montenegrins consider themselves as `` ethnic montenegrin '' and only 28.7 % see themselves as `` ethnic serb '' . 
  since `` ethnic montenegrins '' are of serb origin and share religion with serbs , then why do so many of them not consider themselves serb ? 
  it still is sometimes , just type `` serb sparta '' into google . 
  are you being sarcastic ? 
  if so , whats wrong with using an english word for a country in english ? 
  because the english had an inferiority complex towards latin and tried to use latin or latin-derived ( especially french ) names for as many places in europe as possible . 
  it would be tserna gora , not cherna gora . 
  the word mount is of latin origin . 
  i prefer blackburgh . 
  it was also known as serb sparta ( srpska sparta ) . 
  in all languages , the word for montenegro translates to `` black mountain '' . 
  even montenegro is the latin term for `` black mountain '' ( monte = mountain , negro = black ) .
