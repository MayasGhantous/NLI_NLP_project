  but we do n't use the uk flag to represent welsh and scottish gaelic though . 
  i do n't get why they always use uk 's flag to represent english rather than england 's flag . 
  its not like they use the uk flag to represent welsh or scottish gaelic , so why use the uk flag over england 's flag to represent english ? 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  they 're the same people and spoke the same language ( low franconian ) . 
  they just stopped calling themselves franks . 
  there was a dutch identity . 
  they were called salian franks . 
  it was part of the kingdom of hungary , not austria . 
  list of disputes over european historical figures : ** nikola tesla : ** serbia vs. croatia ** napolean bonaparte : ** france vs. italy ** charlemagne : ** france vs. germany ** kazimir malevich , igor sikorsky : ** ukraine vs. russia ** mozart : ** austria vs. germany ** adam mickiewicz : ** poland vs. lithuania -- any more ? 
  in tennis , people do a little . 
  also , ana ivanovi\u0107 , so better in tennis when you look at both genders . 
  croatia was n't part of austria though . 
  my view is that if it is a recent artificial identity that has become so popular cause of the media , then it is not natural and thus bad to promote . 
  i say let them do what they want in their private life and do n't discriminate against them ; but do not go around telling people its normal/natural , have them in tv shows , do pride parades , force your lgbt views on non-western countries , and other forms of promotion . 
  lol you completely ignored what i said and are just trying to get the last word . 
  good day . 
   incest is mostly talked between siblings because between cousins not only the issue is very different but also more or less accepted in many cultures . 
  well although i was talking about incest in general , which means it is n't only about siblings . 
  but anyways , i was mostly talking about cousin-marriage since it is far more common than sibling marriage , which is unheard of by almost everybody . 
  the context here is the west/europe , where first-cousin marriage is seen as wrong . 
   of course they ca n't . 
  and i gave you a reason why they should n't . 
  cause of the genetic issues ? 
  having children is n't the only reason people marry . 
  incest is n't only between siblings , in fact it very rarely is . 
  it is 1000x more common for it to be between first-cousins than between siblings . 
  but anyways , can legally bonded siblings do all the stuff that straight couples can ? 
   im guessing they just fucked and didnt want to marry , which gays still do today even if they can get married or not . 
  why did no gays want to marry back then but many gays want to marry today ? 
   animals cant consent , gays can . 
  you cant compare it to that . 
  and i honestly dont really care about incest . 
  again , if they consent to the sex i dont care . 
  you can outlaw incest sex but it will still happen either way . 
  how do you think animals consent in the animal world ? 
  do they have verbal consent where they specifically have a conversation about sex before having it ? 
  no , animal consent if simply them not rejecting the advances of their partner . 
  if a human tries to have sex with a dog and the dog kicks back or goes away , then he is declining the human . 
  but if the dog does n't do that but willingly has sex , then the dog is giving consent . 
   wew lad , careful or i might start bleeding from cutting myself whatever the reasoning was behind the initial origins of starting/promoting the homosexual identity , it ca n't be compared to straight couples since straight couples have always existed and are necessary for human survival and historically/currently present in every single species , ethnicity , tribe , and society . 
  * exclusive * gays only exist among humans ( not all human ethnic groups even ) and are recent . 
  you can make up theories about how gays in history are n't recorded because they were scared of coming out , but those are just baseless theories . 
  its to argue that the pro-gay people are hypocrites that want to promote this lifestyle simply because they do n't find it disgusting . 
  if they approve of incest , then my assumptions ( in this specific case ) were wrong and they are n't hypocrites . 
  but the only reason some people say yes to gay marriage and no to incest is because of what they find personally disgusting . 
  what if they did n't meet up later in life separately ? 
  you ca n't prove they were groomed ( i 've never heard of siblings being groomed for marriage ) . 
  what if they 're first cousins ? 
  sorry for the late reply , forgot about this comment ...  i still dont believe that no gay guys throughout history were not pedos . 
  gay sex just happened in private so you dont get killed , which is quite understandable . 
  im not saying i have any source for this , it just seem very illogical and unlikely , atleast to me . 
  i already mentioned that gay pedophilia was punishable in many cultures . 
  if we have records of gay pedophilia , then why not of non-pedo gays ? 
  there were also some cultures in the past that pro-gays say were `` tolerant of homosexuality '' such as the ancient greeks , romans , etc. 
  why did no gay marriages/unions ever occur back then ? 
  also , can you explain why gays are over represented in pedeophilia ? 
  remember , being a pedo is as much a choice as being gay . 
   but its not . 
  being gay has existed for thousands of years before the medias . 
  in some animal species you can also find homosexality , have they also been brainwashed my the medias ? 
  gay sex has , but not the concept of homosexuality . 
  animals are relatively primitive lifeforms that just act upon their instincts . 
  they do n't have the concept of a man-made sexuality . 
  i 've also never heard of animals that were exclusively attracted to the same sex or avoided members of the opposite gender . 
   well im pro `` people-doing-what-they-want-to-do '' lifestyle . 
  you do n't think you 're going down a slippery slope their ? 
  that gives an open door to incest/zoophilia advocates . 
   gays are such a small minority , they barely have any influence . 
  besides being straight doesnt mean you are gon na pop out babies . 
  im most likely not gon na have kids myself , im i also unnatural ? 
  at least the option of having babies is there if you are straight . 
  also , being straight is n't a recent man-made lifestyle to appease the urges of a few perverts . 
  what if the incest couple is of the same sex ? 
  should gay incest marriage be allowed at least ? 
  what if the incest couple is sterile ? 
  what if they love each other and do n't plan on having children ? 
  what about incest marriage ? 
  two consenting adults marrying each other . 
  what about liechtenstein ? 
  you 're going to answer my question by asking another question ? 
  -_- anyways , the reason is because usa was unfairly taxed and being divided into separate continents separated by hundreds of kilometers of water did n't help either . 
  also , i did n't say that luxembourg should join germany , i was just wondering how it avoided german unification since it was considered german back then . 
  why is n't luxembourg part of germany ? 
  france is only larger than ukraine when you include french guiana . 
  it comes from north germany . 
  the nogais are named after an overthrown dynasty . 
  do dutch people know he belonged to their kin ? 
  they were bogomils which is why they were not liked by orthodox serbs and catholic croats , and this helped distance them socially from them and develop a new identity . 
  iirc , the pomaks were also bogomils and this played a role in them becoming muslim and subsequently becoming their own ethnicity . 
  just cause they had conflict with orthodox serbs does n't necessarily mean they saw themselves as a different ethnicity . 
  could n't bosnian just have been a regional identity ? 
  do they distinguish themselves from serbs ? 
  if bosnians were n't serbs , then how come there is no record of any slavic tribe called `` bosnian '' ? 
  we have records of serb and croat tribes since their migration from central europe , but not the same for bosniaks . 
  how is charlemagne seen in the netherlands ? 
  shtokavian works . 
  i wish turkey was still named something like ottomany/ottomania so that this whole turkic vs. turkish confusion did n't exist . 
  no , arran is just the persian name for them whereas albania is the latin/greek/english name . 
  both are foreign names .
