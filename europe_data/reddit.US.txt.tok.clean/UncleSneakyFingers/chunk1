interesting . 
  thanks for the link . 
  i wish the origin was a little more conclusive , but unfortunately , that 's not the case . 
  both of my grandmothers are 100 % irish by heritage . 
  i see one of their family names ( mccarthy ) , but not the other one ( lynch ) . 
  is lynch an uncommon irish last name ? 
  can anyone see it on the map , or just know what region of ireland it comes from ? 
  do n't you have anything better to do on a friday night than argue with me about stupid bullshit . 
  go get drunk like everyone else . 
  whatever dude . 
  that was a few centuries ago . 
  get over yourself, 
  what 's so ironic about my comment and me being an american ? 
  why did the swedes expel them a month later ? 
  `` bulgaria will be , in effect , a roma country by the middle of this century . 
  by 2050 , the population of ethnic bulgarians is expected to shrink to 800,000 , while the number of bulgarian roma is expected to crest 3.5 million . 
  a 2010 projection indicated that 20 % of hungary 's population and 40 % of its workforce will consist of roma by the same year . '', 
  so bulgarians are going to be a minority in their own country , and the majority will be gypsies . 
  sucks for the bulgarians , but it will be interesting to see how a country dominated by gypsies will be run . 
  will all the top politicians be gypsies , or will it continue to be run by bulgarians ? 
  are there any examples of gypsies running a country at any point in history that we can look at to see how it was run ? 
  are hungarians bitter about losing transylvania or something ? 
  the way i see sports/fans in europe is so different than sports in north america . 
  fans in europe seem to tie ethnicity and history into their sports in a way that just does n't happen here . 
  our rivalries come strictly from the histories of the teams , whereas it seems rivalries in european sports come from the history of the countries . 
  that 's just my observation though , not sure if that 's really how it is . 
  i miss ron artest . 
  [ meta world peace ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf8pgba-ad4 ) is like a totally different person now . 
  call me crazy , but that 's usually not something i worry about in my day to day life . 
  in case of paywall : the world economy is not in good shape . 
  the news from america and britain has been reasonably positive , but japan 's economy is struggling and china 's growth is now slower than at any time since 2009 . 
  unpredictable dangers abound , particularly from the ebola epidemic , which has killed thousands in west africa and jangled nerves far beyond . 
  but the biggest economic threat , by far , comes from continental europe . 
  now that german growth has stumbled , the euro area is on the verge of tipping into its third recession in six years . 
  its leaders have squandered two years of respite , granted by the pledge of mario draghi , the european central bank 's president , to do `` whatever it takes '' to save the single currency . 
  the french and the italians have dodged structural reforms , while the germans have insisted on too much austerity . 
  prices are falling in eight european countries . 
  the zone 's overall inflation rate has slipped to 0.3 % and may well go into outright decline next year . 
  a region that makes up almost a fifth of world output is marching towards stagnation and deflation . 
  optimists , both inside and outside europe , often cite the example of japan . 
  it fell into deflation in the late-1990s , with unpleasant but not apocalyptic consequences for both itself and the world economy . 
  but the euro zone poses far greater risks . 
  unlike japan , the euro zone is not an isolated case : from china to america inflation is worryingly low , and slipping . 
  and , unlike japan , which has a homogenous , stoic society , the euro area can not hang together through years of economic sclerosis and falling prices . 
  as debt burdens soar from italy to greece , investors will take fright , populist politicians will gain ground , and -- sooner rather than later -- the euro will collapse . 
  ** this parrot has ceased to be ** although many europeans , especially the germans , have been brought up to fear inflation , deflation can be still more savage ( see article ) . 
  if people and firms expect prices to fall , they stop spending , and as demand sinks , loan defaults rise . 
  that was what happened in the great depression , with especially dire consequences in germany in the early 1930s . 
  so it is worrying that , of the 46 countries whose central banks target inflation , 30 are below their target . 
  some price falls are welcome . 
  tumbling oil prices , in particular , have given consumers ' incomes a boost ( see article ) . 
  but slowing prices and stagnant wages owe more to weak demand in the economy and roughly 45m workers are jobless in the rich oecd countries . 
  investors are starting to expect lower inflation even in economies , such as america 's , that are growing at reasonable rates . 
  worse , short-term interest rates are close to zero in many economies , so central banks can not cut them to boost spending . 
  the only ammunition comes from quantitative easing and other forms of printing money . 
  the global lowflation threat is a good reason for most central banks to keep monetary policy loose . 
  it is also , in the longer term , a prompt to look at revising inflation targets a shade upwards . 
  but the immediate problem is the euro area . 
  continental europe 's economy has plenty of big underlying weaknesses , from poor demography to heavy debt and sclerotic labour markets . 
  but it has also made enormous policy mistakes . 
  france , italy and germany have all eschewed growth-enhancing structural reforms . 
  the euro zone is particularly vulnerable to deflation because of germany 's insistence on too much fiscal austerity and the ecb 's timidity . 
  even now , with economies contracting , germany is still obsessed with deficit reduction for all governments , while its opposition to monetary easing has meant that the ecb , to the obvious despair of mr draghi , has done far less than other big central banks in terms of quantitative easing ( notwithstanding this week 's move to start buying `` covered bonds '' ) . 
  if there was ever logic to this incrementalism , it has run out . 
  as budgets shrink and the ecb struggles to convince people that it can stop prices slipping , a descent into deflation seems all too probable . 
  signs of stress are beginning to appear in both the markets and politics . 
  bond yields in greece have risen sharply , as support for the left-wing syriza party has surged ( see article ) . 
  france and germany are trading rhetorical blows over a new budget proposal coming out of paris . 
  ** joining the bleedin ' choir invisible ** if europe is to stop its economy getting worse , it will have to stop its self-destructive behaviour . 
  the ecb needs to start buying sovereign bonds . 
  germany 's chancellor , angela merkel , should allow france and italy to slow the pace of their fiscal cuts ; in return , those countries should accelerate structural reforms . 
  germany , which can borrow money at negative real interest rates , could spend more building infrastructure at home . 
  that would help , but not be enough . 
  it is a bit like the early years of the euro debacle , before mr draghi 's whatever-it-takes pledge , when half-solutions only fed the crisis . 
  something radical is needed . 
  the hitch is that european law bans many textbook solutions , such as ecb purchases of newly issued government bonds . 
  the best legal option is to couple a dramatic increase in infrastructure spending with bond-buying by the ecb . 
  thus the european investment bank could launch a big ( say $ 300 billion , or $ 383 billion ) expansion in investments such as faster cross-border rail links to more integrated electricity grids -- and raise the money by issuing bonds , which the ecb could buy in the secondary market . 
  another possibility would be to redefine the eu 's deficit rules to exclude investment spending , which would allow governments to run bigger deficits , again with the ecb providing a backstop . 
  behind all this sits a problem of political will ( see article ) . 
  mrs merkel and the germans seem prepared to take action only when the single currency is on the verge of catastrophe . 
  throughout europe people are hurting -- in italy and spain youth unemployment is above 40 % . 
  voters vented their fury with the established order in the eu 's parliamentary elections earlier this summer , and got very little change . 
  another descent into the abyss will test their patience . 
  and once deflation has an economy in its jaws , it is very hard to shake off . 
  europe 's leaders are running out of time . 
  makes sense . 
  when i lived in arizona ( american state bordering mexico ) , the spaniards that came there would often look down on mexicans and sneer at their accent . 
  it happened a few times when i was working in the restaurant industry to my co-workers who were mexican ( which was about half of the staff ) . 
  and the spanish exchange student who came to our school would make fun of mexicans a lot , and looked down on them for ruining her language . 
  i know it 's highly anecdotal , but it seems to coincide with your experience . 
  so take it for what its worth . 
  so basically , stay as far away from gypsies as possible . 
  good lord . 
  how does trash like that spread ? 
  it 's worse than ebola, 
  that 's so crazy . 
  i have never seen a gypsy , so when europeans talk about them , it 's almost hard to believe . 
  they 're so bizarre . 
  i 'm so sorry .
