  as long as i stay in the us , i should be fine then . 
  unclesneakyfingers : 8 = = = =d america : 8 = = =d i 'm forgetting the idea of ever trying to get laid in europe now . 
  i do n't want the locals laughing at me . 
  at least at home i am respectable . 
  relax man , just having a little fun here . 
  of course all these comments are idiotic . 
  we 're talking about penis size , do you think there is a mature way to have this conversation ? 
  it demonstrates confidence , which is a sign of having a big penis . 
  here is a handy graphic i made to help you understand the difference in penis size between europe and the good ol' us of a : europe : 8 = =d america : 8 = = = = = = = = = = = =d this does n't need to be a contest between europe and america . 
  europe just needs to resign itself to its place in the world , and bow before their masters . 
  it 's not really that big of a deal . 
  only people with small penises demand sources :d . people with regular sized penises do n't feel the need to question other people 's integrity . 
  except for mushrooms . 
  good god , those things radically change your life for the better . 
  every human being needs to try mushrooms at least once . 
  only people with small penises say they do n't have small penises . 
  and that 's a fact . 
  so what do you have to say about * that !, 
  * boom !, 
  i just fucked you up with some facts . 
  yeah that was more what i had in mind . 
  not pictures of rubble that used to be buildings . 
  now that you mention it , that list would probably just be a collection of photos of crumbling rocks . 
  not exactly what i had in mind ( old churches , castles etc. . . ) . 
  oh well , i guess we 're stuck with this list of pathetically puny european buildings . 
  it 's kinda like at some point europe just gave up competing . 
  i have came up with a motto for europe . 
  europe : meh , we 're content . 
  it 's better than having a ton of history and still only managing to come in 4th . 
  suck it you limey bastard :d, 
  and we 're kicking your ass !, 
  arabs  americans  europeans . 
  how does it feel bro ? 
  okay okay , i 'm just having a little fun here . 
  there are always ways to create a pissing contest to demonstrate supposed superiority . 
  for instance , instead of comparing tallest buildings by country , compare oldest buildings by country . 
  we really would n't be able to compete in that category . 
  on a side note , somebody should create a list of the oldest buildings in the eu by country . 
  that would actually be cool to see . 
  europe : land of puny buildings . 
  [ are ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tallest_buildings_in_the_united_states#tallest_buildings ) you guys even trying anymore ? 
  lol . 
  you could easily get a dedicated column in the guardian if you keep writing apologist drivel like that . 
  keep up the good work , and one day you too can write vomit inducing opinion pieces for leftist rags on a regular basis . 
  why are you comparing london to new york , especially since most large scale war protests occur in washington dc , not new york . 
  it does n't take a lot of googling to find out that by 2005 , the iraq war had completely lost all its popularity :  gallup polls updated september 14 , 2007 state , `` since the summer of 2005 , opponents of the war have tended to outnumber supporters . 
  a majority of americans believe the war was a mistake . '', 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protests_against_the_iraq_war ) . 
  there were regular protests with tens of thousands of people as early as 2003 . 
  are you trying to suggest that iraq war was popular in the us ? 
  you have severe and consistent delusional views about the us , but if you think the iraq war was popular a year out from the start of it , you are seriously mistaken . 
  interesting video ... why was it in english though ? 
  ( the text was at least , i '' m at work and my speakers are on mute so i could n't tell if there was an audio component to this ) . 
  who is the intended audience for this video ? 
  regarding the submarine joke , there is a similar one about poles : how do you sink a polish submarine ? 
  put it in water . 
  i 'm pretty sure the way unemployment numbers are calculated are standardized internationally . 
  so if the us numbers are low , so too are all other european countries . 
  i could be wrong though . 
  i am not complaining . 
  i just enjoy a good ol' gypsy debate . 
  you have to understand that i have zero experience with gypsies . 
  i have never seen one . 
  so the discussions i see about them are very entertaining since they are entirely alien to me . 
  i 'm basically trying to stir some shit up for my own pleasure . 
  that is all . 
  it 's been a while since a gypsy thread has been on this sub . 
  at least four days . 
  that 's like a lifetime here . 
  so she 's basically known nation wide for being hideous ? 
  i guess any attention is good attention . 
  not a single good looking one amongst the whole lot . 
  i do n't know how people in malta reproduce ... they must have really low standards . 
  lol . 
  who is that hideous old hag and why were you expecting to see her ? 
  is she well known for being all sorts of ugly or something ? 
  why not ? 
  that 's how nafta works . 
  so it goes ... 
  you can either open it in an incognito tab , or google the headline . 
  if you really wanted to read the article as opposed to leaving a snarky comment , you could figure it out . 
  that is a much more understandable explanation than the `` we are europeans who are too progressive to get offended by such things '' responses i was given by two other people here . 
   nobody cares if you burn or deface one really ? 
  i highly doubt `` no one cares '' . 
  regardless , do you not think it is in extremely bad taste to do this at a soccer game ? 
  that was a very sobering letter . 
  thanks for posting that . 
  damn , i ca n't imagine anyone reading that and not feeling deep shame about their government . 
  the people of ukraine seem to have been discarded like trash , as casually as flicking a cigarette butt out the window of your car on the highway . 
  this is a truly shameful moment for europe . 
  i would think people would complain . 
  none of those have any place in a soccer game . 
  a sports venue is not a political rally or a venue for protesting geopolitics . 
  plus , displaying a defaced flag of any country at a sports game is entirely inappropriate since the game has nothing to do with what is going on in the world , and it also defies common decency . 
  i 'm talking about what is simply right and wrong here . 
  it 's pretty black and white . 
  this should n't need an explanation . 
  well i guess to me at least , i differentiate about showing a flag out of solidarity , and defacing a flag by righting `` fuck israel '' on it . 
  those are two totally different things in my opinion . 
  why the fuck were n't [ these ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/23/article-2703409-1fe9f57900000578-822_634x399.jpg ) assholes kicked out ?
