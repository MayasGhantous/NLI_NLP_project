  marriage for legal purposes should be open to whatever that state allows . 
  those two types of marriage should be kept separate if there are conflicts in a culture . 
  if using different terms would help separate the two in people 's minds , then perhaps that should be up for discussion as well . 
  i just guessed that marriage always preceded adoption . 
  looks like this does n't apply to ireland so my assumption in my previous comment was wrong . 
  yeah i just assumed that things like adoption would come after marriage , and not the other way around . 
  turns out i was wrong . 
  also , how would these posters really change anything if adoption is already legal ? 
  seems like they 're busy fighting yesterday 's battles . 
  on a side note , what about this is `` unchristian '' ? 
  the misleading nature of the posters , or the fact that they are opposed to gay marriage ? 
  ( honestly , this whole debate can get a little confusing because it depends on what is meant by `` marriage '' as there are both secular and religious definitions and i am not sure about the distinctions between the two in ireland ) . 
  i would think opposing gay marriage is in fact , a very christian thing to do ( if marriage implies full union before god or something like that ) . 
   note that there is no reference to surrogacy , or adoption ( which has been dealt with in separate legislation ) but hey , do n't let the facts get in the way of a good emotive argument !, 
  but these are inevitable consequences of marriage , are they not ? 
  if not now , then these issues will come up at some point . 
  so why are you giving these posters shit ? 
  arguments about surrogacy for gay couples and adoption are essentially extensions of arguments about gay marriage . 
  that was the dumbest article have read in a very long time . 
  how did the author get that published ? 
   ** breaking the law of comparative advantage **  in looking at the european union , the assumption is that each nation pursuing its comparative advantage will maximize its possibilities . 
  by this i mean that each country will export that thing which it does best , importing things that others produce more efficiently . 
  the comparative aspect is not only between nations but also between the products within the nation . 
  therefore , each nation is focusing on the things that it does best . 
  but `` best '' does not tell us how well they do it . 
  it merely tells us that it 's the best they can do , and from that they will prosper . 
   the problem is that the time frame might be so long that it will take generations to see a meaningful result of this measure . 
  thus , germany sees the results faster than greece . 
  since economic power can translate in many ways , the power of germany limits the practical possibilities of greece . 
  moreover , whatever advantage there is in free trade for the greeks , it flows unequally . 
   this is when comparative advantage runs as it should . 
  but it has not run that way in europe , because germany has been forced by its economic reality to pursue exports of not only those products where it has a comparative advantage internally , but many products for which it lacks an internal advantage but has a comparative advantage externally -- these are not necessarily the things it does best , but it does them better than others . 
  since germany is efficient in multiple senses , it has advantages in many products and takes that advantage . 
  germany has a staggering export rate of more than 50 percent of gross domestic product . 
  comparative advantage assumes it will want to export those things that it produces most efficiently . 
  it is instead exporting any product that it can export competitively regardless of the relative internal advantage . 
   put another way , germany is not following the law of comparative advantage . 
  social scientists have many laws of behavior that are said to describe what people do and then turn into moral arguments of what they should do . 
  i am not doing that . 
  germany empirically is not driven by ricardo 's theories but by its own needs . 
  in other words , the law of comparative advantage does n't work in europe . 
  * as a result , germany has grown faster than other european countries , has accumulated more power than other countries and has managed to distribute wealth in a way that creates political stability . 
  *  ** comparative advantage and the greek issue **  the result is that greece is answerable to germany on its debts . 
  in the same way that no moral judgment can be drawn about germany , none can be drawn about greece . 
  it is what it is . 
  * however , whatever problem it has in maximizing its own exports , doing so in an environment where germany is pursuing all export possibilities that have any advantage decreases greece 's opportunity to export , thereby creating a long-term dysfunction in greece . 
  the german superiority perpetuates itself . 
  *  it is important to note that germany did not operate without protections after world war ii . 
  it protected its recovering industries from american competition . 
  the united states , an economic colossus that exports a relatively small amount of its production , also was heavily protectionist in the late 19th century . 
  similarly , the united kingdom maintained tariffs to protect the british empire 's markets . 
  greece has no such protection . 
   the theory of comparative advantage is generally true , but it does n't take into account time disparities , the geopolitical consequences of time lags or internal social dislocation . 
  that is why i said it was both true and incomplete . 
  * and that is also why the european union , however it might have been conceived in its simplest sense , suffers from massive disparities in the speed that nations accumulate wealth , has nations that do not behave as the theory predicts they should , and creates geopolitical imbalances externally and social dislocation internally . 
  it 's not that free trade does n't work . 
  it 's that it has unintended consequences . 
  *  this is why i would argue that the sturm und drang over greece 's debt and the future of the euro misses the point . 
  the fundamental point is that the consequences of free trade are not always positive . 
  it is not clear to me how greece ever recovers without the protections that germany or the united states had during their early growth period . 
  and since nations do what they have to do , the issue is not the euro , but free trade . 
   and this is germany 's dread . 
  it is a nation that exports as much as it consumes , and half of that goes to the european free trade zone . 
  more than anyone , it needs the free trade zone for its own well-being . 
  this is why , however the germans growl , it is not the grexit they fear but rising tariffs . 
  the european union already allows substantial agricultural tariffs and subsidies . 
  if they allow broader tariffs for greece , then when does it stop ? 
  and if they do n't , and greece crumbles socially , where does that stop ? 
  free trade can be marvelous or dreadful , depending on circumstances , and sometimes both at the same time . 
  this is a really interesting issue about the unintended consquences of free trade within the eu ( and other issues that naturally arise within any economic union as well ) . 
  here is the text in case of paywall :  the greek crisis is moving toward a climax . 
  the issue is actually quite simple . 
  the greek government owes a great deal of money to european institutions and the international monetary fund . 
  it has accumulated this debt over time , but it has become increasingly difficult for greece to meet its payments . 
  if greece does n't meet these payments , the imf and european institutions have said they will not extend any more loans to greece . 
  greece must make a calculation . 
  if it pays the loans on time and receives additional funding , will it be better off than not paying the loans and being cut off from more ? 
   obviously , the question is more complex . 
  it is not clear that if the greeks refuse to pay , they will be cut off from further loans . 
  first , the other side might be bluffing , as it has in the past . 
  second , if they do pay the next round , and they do get the next tranche of funding , is this simply kicking the can down the road ? 
  does it solve greece 's underlying problem , which is that its debt structure is unsustainable ? 
  in a world that contains argentina and american airlines , we have learned that bankruptcy and lack of access to credit markets do not necessarily go hand in hand . 
   to understand what might happen , we need to look at hungary . 
  hungary did not join the euro , and its currency , the forint , had declined in value . 
  mortgages taken out by hungarians denominated in euros , swiss francs and yen spiraled in terms of forints , and large numbers of hungarians faced foreclosure from european banks . 
  in a complex move , the hungarian government declared that these debts would be repaid in forints . 
  the banks by and large accepted prime minister viktor orban 's terms , and the european union grumbled but went along . 
  hungary was not the only country to experience this problem , but its response was the most assertive . 
   a strategy inspired by budapest would have the greeks print drachmas and announce ( not offer ) that the debt would be repaid in that currency . 
  the euro could still circulate in greece and be legal tender , but the government would pay its debts in drachmas . 
   ** the deeper questions **  in considering this and other scenarios , the pervading question is whether greece leaves or stays in the eurozone . 
  but before that , there are still two fundamental questions . 
  first , in or out of the euro , how does greece pay its debts currently without engendering social chaos ? 
  the second and far more important question is how does greece revive its economy ? 
  lurching from debt payment to debt payment , from german and imf threats to german and imf threats is amusing from a distance . 
  it does not , however , address the real issue : greece , and other countries , can not exist as normal , coherent states under these circumstances , and in european history , long-term economic dysfunction tends to lead to political extremism and instability . 
  the euro question may be interesting , but the deeper economic question is of profound importance to both the debtor and creditors . 
   in our time , economic and financial questions tend to become moralistic . 
  on one side , the creditors condemn greek irresponsibility .
