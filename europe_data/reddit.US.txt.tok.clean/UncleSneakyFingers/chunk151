  the british picture is bleaker -- facing a squeeze , the bbc world service ended broadcasts in ukrainian in 2011 -- but officials have at least woken up to the danger . 
  countering the storm of russian propaganda will require innovative thinking as well as money , two resources in scarce supply in europe . 
  but it is worth giving truth a chance . 
  that will make it difficult for people to listen to protesters ' demands if there does n't seem to be a coherent stance they are backing . 
  this just underlines the lack of coordination between the protesters . 
  this will be dismissed because it will come across like they do n't even know what they are protesting about . 
  same as occupy wallstreet . 
  is that enough though to cement relationships ? 
  for instance , i would not see italy having strong cultural bonds with mexico even though both are catholic countries . 
  i do n't really know a lot about orthodox faiths to make a comparison though . 
  that 's pretty much what i expected . 
  thanks for elaborating . 
  it 's understandable that in times of stress , it 's hard to turn down business opportunities . 
  well , even without economic issues , it 's hard to turn down business opportunities . 
  i 'd want economic relations with russia restored as soon as possible if i were greek as well . 
  i 'm confused . 
  picture 19 shows a sign saying `` solidarity beyond borders '' . 
  picture 71 says `` fuck syriza '' ... 
  i also see `` left is dead '' next to a sickle and hammer . 
  these guys seem all over the place . 
  i ca n't tell where they stand at all on these issues . 
  unfortunately , i do not . 
  i looked to see if i could find some scanned pages in a pdf or something , but i could n't find anything . 
  i would have to go home and flip through that book to try and find the page . 
  i wish there was an easier way to link single pages from a book on the internet , but that is n't always possible . 
  how is the mood right now in greece with respect to russia ? 
  is there any animosity towards russia like in other countries ? 
  any sympathy ? 
  or is it a strictly business like relationship ? 
  reminds of a quote from stalin : `` romanian is not a nationality , it is a profession '' well , at least milovan djilas attributes that quote to him in `` conversations with stalin '' . 
  why is deep fried pizza on that list ? 
  that sounds amazing . 
  dear russia , please take your dick out of my country 's ass . 
  sincerely , a concerned american, 
  maybe it 's of the throat ripping variety ? 
  you would need to arm yourself and keep a credible defense ? 
  ummm have you seen the countries in nato . 
  it 's like the retirement home of militaries . 
  just maintaining current levels of spending would be a god send . 
  most countries basically eliminate their military upon joining nato . 
   he 's an extrovert , does n't give a shit what people think of him , and he 's also very tall . 
  this also describes to me . 
  where do i put in my application for `` king of france '' ? 
  that was a very troubling article . 
  it makes you wonder if russia has some bigger plan in mind . 
  damn ... just think of all the chicks you would pick up if you had a pet tiger . 
  that 's why putin is so much cooler than me . 
  no i was n't kidding . 
  and thanks , i 've wondering about the origins of this video for far too long ( and far too lazy to spend 3 seconds googling it ) . 
  that 's not what i mean . 
  i was just asking about non inhabited areas in general . 
  but i could see how my previous comment would be confusing . 
  no , i was n't suggesting you blow up national parks . 
  no dude . 
  the eagle is burning the soccer balls with his breath of patriot fire . 
  we will never care about soccer !, 
  yeah caterpillar has facilities all over the us ( and world ) . 
  but even if that person lived in peoria , there would be a zero person chance i would have met him . 
  cat 's headquarters are here , and they have many factories and other facilities here also . 
  nearly every male in this city works for caterpillar . 
  its bizarre , since i have never lived in a city so dominated by one company . 
  so yeah , no way i would know him . 
  neither do i. 
  it 's an easy mistake to make since a lot of those fake pictures are the first ones to appear . 
  but its not like the real pictures of the bad parts of detroit look totally different . 
  basically replace shanty towns with run down houses . 
  the effect is pretty much the same . 
  wow . 
  i wonder how many more people can fit in the netherlands . 
  looks pretty full to me . 
  cool picture by the way ... i stared at it way too long . 
  but i think he could have found a different picture showing parts of detroit like [ this ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/vurompopjs8/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  i actually searched the picture he linked ( just by googling `` detroit slums '' ) and many of those pictures appear actually to be in africa or south america . 
  hell , i even found an [ article ] ( http://www.snopes.com/photos/architecture/detroit.asp ) with that same picture talking about how a lot of those pictures were photo shopped . 
  anyway , i understand his broader point , and / u/malonemuistu probably did not even know that picture was fake . 
  i was just pointing out that detroit does n't have palm trees , or slums that look like that . 
  anyway , i get what he was trying to say ... one picture does not describe the whole situation . 
  i guess i got caught up in some minor details . 
  hmmm ... 
  i was a bit skeptical of your detroit picture . 
  i lived there for a year and never saw anything like that ( although , i did never drive around touring ghettos and there were dilapidated buildings , just not the shanties there ) . 
  also , i took a closer look and saw palm trees in the background . 
  there are no palm trees around for about 1500 miles . 
  if that is detroit , that is a very strange part of detroit that does n't look anything like the rest of the city . 
  go to arizona !, 
  it is remarkably diverse and there is so much nature to see in just that one state . 
  i have lived in 6 different states , and been to many more . 
  i think arizona is way better than most of the states i have been to .

  also , all the states surrounding arizona also contain this much diversity . 
  new mexico is just as beautiful , and utah perhaps even more so . 
  the southwest of the united states is so underrated , but it is by far my favorite part of the country . 
  those pictures looked beautiful . 
  not sure how big those places are , but at least there 's a little nature to enjoy . 
  england to arizona . 
  well that is quite the change . 
  what brought you to arizona if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  how did you like it ? 
  so ... where do people go if they want to see nature ?
