  hell , the legend you cited has the darkest areas at 1.25 % of households , which is a tiny fraction . 
  the places they mention with the highest percentage is a small community in south dakota ( never been to that state ) , and indian reservation in arizona ( i lived in that state , that reservation is extremely remote , and non-apache are n't really allowed there without permission from the reservation ) . 
  and alaska has many , small , remote villages . 
  once again , the places they mention are tiny places in remote areas of the country . 
  i have no contact with those places , nor does 99 % of the rest of america . 
  so yeah , it 's easy to see why i thought homes without plumbing are extremely rare ... they are . 
  but it is 2014 in europe , and not 1614 in europe , nor 2014 in sub saharan african . 
  people are flawed and make assumptions about some basic expectations . 
  they have been doing that for as long as people have been shitting outside : b, 
  why is that weird to you ? 
  the headline says : `` percentile of apartments with bathrooms '' i guess this means the apartments have communal bathrooms , not bathrooms in individual apartment suites themselves . 
  the headline is kinda unclear . 
  anyway , if a building did not have bathrooms in it , asking the question `` how do you shower ? 
  where do you shit ? '', 
  is quite valid , is n't it ? 
  what is confusing about this ? 
  yeah i was just making a sarcastic comment . 
  anyway , i checked out that sub . 
  i 'm kinda waiting for it to grow a little a more . 
  i subscribed , and i may comment , but i am not certain how different it will be from this sub . 
  i have no idea when plumbing reached poland , or the average age of polish apartments . 
  do you think i am a historian on polish plumbing and construction ? 
  in case of paywall , here is the text :  ** poland just had the best 25 years in half a millennium , but its transformation remains unfinished **  over most of the past decade , the european union has been in a sorry state . 
  countries such as greece and the newest member , croatia , are basket-cases . 
  ordinary voters have lost trust in the eu : at the recent european elections barely two-fifths of them bothered to cast a ballot and almost a third of those who did backed anti-european or populist parties . 
  instead of devising a convincing response , european leaders will spend this week 's summit bickering over whether jean-claude juncker , an uninspiring old-school federalist from luxembourg , is the right person to run the european commission . 
   yet one big country defies the general gloom : poland , the subject of our special report this week . 
  once considered the problem child of central europe , poland has seen its economy grow since the collapse of communism by more than any other in the eu . 
  it was the only eu member to avoid a recession during the financial crisis . 
  and it has managed to have more cordial relations than ever before with its two big neighbours ( and former occupiers ) , germany and russia -- or it did at least until russia annexed crimea earlier this year . 
  it is hard to think of any country in europe , rich or poor , that ca n't learn something from poland . 
   [ gdp % change on a year earlier : poland vs. euro area ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20140628_ldc236.png )  ** from periphery to core ** how did poland do so much better than central europe 's stars -- the czech republic , for instance , with its deep industrial roots ? 
  unlike most of its ex-communist neighbours , which opted for a softer transition to capitalism , poland embarked on `` shock therapy '' in 1990 , masterminded by leszek balcerowicz , then finance minister . 
  almost overnight price controls went , markets were fully opened to foreign trade , the zloty was made convertible , subsidies to state-owned industries were slashed and privatisation began . 
  this was painful for nearly everyone , but after a short , sharp slump in which gdp shrank by almost 15 % , growth resumed in 1992 -- and it has not stopped since . 
   the biggest single contribution to poland 's success , however , was its effective use of eu membership . 
  the poles were quick to see the opportunities in the eu 's structural and cohesion funds as well as the benefits of improving their own governance and transparency . 
  poland fought harder than romania , bulgaria and its visegrad peers against corruption , especially in public procurement , and has a decent record of using structural funds as a result . 
  the eu has rewarded poland 's probity by making it the biggest recipient of its funds ( a whopping $ 102 billion , or $ 139 billion ) between 2007 and 2013 . 
  the country will once again get the biggest chunk ( $ 106 billion ) in the next multi-year budget from 2014 to 2020 . 
   however , poland 's third lesson is the one that matters most : the job is never done . 
  poland has kept pushing ahead with reforms , in a way that germany has not , let alone france . 
  and there is still more work to do , such as slimming the bloated public sector , raising corporate and private saving and investment , and persuading more bright poles to stay at home rather than emigrate . 
  poland will avoid the `` middle-income trap '' only if it can develop higher-tech industries and services . 
   over the past seven years the civic platform government has done well at combating complacency . 
  but now it is stuck in a nasty scandal , based on tape recordings of boozy conversations between leading politicians . 
  in one , radek sikorski , the foreign minister , calls the polish-american alliance `` worthless '' and mocks britain 's prime minister . 
  the government seems likely to tough the scandal out . 
  but even if polish ministers lose their jobs , mr juncker and europe 's timid leaders should not miss the main point . 
  if they had run their countries half as well as poland , europe would not be in such a mess . 
  also , this weeks edition of the economist has a 7 article special report devoted to poland . 
  i copied the links here . 
  if anyone needs me to copy and paste the body of the text of those articles , let me know and i will gladly post them here ( or maybe i should post them seperately to / r/europe ? ),

  it would be interesting to see an a map associated with this one that shows the average age of each apartment/dwelling . 
  i wonder if the apartments in the east are on average older than the ones in the west , and how much older they are . 
  looks luxurious . 
  the communal bathroom thing kind of makes sense ( a lot of college dorms here have communal bathrooms ) . 
  but i figured there were n't even communal bathrooms since the title says `` apartments with bathrooms '' . 
  anyway , it must be such a pain the ass to have to walk down a bunch of stairs and run to an outhouse every time you have to shit . 
  i 'd shit in a bucket and toss it out the window like the good ol' days . 
  why would an apartment not have a bathroom ? 
  how do you shower ? 
  where do you shit ? 
   the only difference is that he 's much more duplicitous and he 's black . 
  actually , he 's irish . 
  and of all people , you should know that . 
  when it comes to online shit ? 
  who knows . 
  i 'm pretty sure this wo n't change anything though . 
  the internet is still murky territory . 
  that should be easy . 
  we do n't have any privacy protection rights either . 
  case closed . 
  they are n't very good at pr . 
  i can understand it . 
  i 'm not sure i agree with it . 
  but i guess that is what makes cultures different . 
  if that 's how you feel , fair enough . 
  i have a follow up question . 
  i posted a link in this thread somewhere else , but it shows that taxes in finland are ~ 13 % higher than canada 's ( 43.4 % vs. 31 % ) . 
  do you think there is any merit in the argument that it is better to have lower taxes , and pay the medications costs out of hospital , or to have higher taxes and have them be free ? 
  people are not always in a state of illness , and having lower taxes here would be a preferential situation to a lot of people . 
  if you do not agree with that argument , why ? 
  once again , just curious here . 
  ( [ link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_spending#as_a_percentage_of_gdp ) again just in case ), 
  and do you find canada 's social welfare programs to be insufficient ? 
  canadian 's by and large do not . 
  so who 's model is right * ? 
  * i should point out that i do not believe there is a universal correct answer here , as this level of spending depends on what the citizens of each country desire . 
  i 'm just curious to know if you think that `` more spending '' is always a good thing . 
  but this is n't `` my media '' . 
  this article is british media , and the author is [ risto penttil\u00e4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/risto_penttil%c3%a4 ) , who as you probably know is finnish . 
  looking through his wikipedia page tells me he probably knows far more than you do . 
  and since you do not understand the very basic premise of an aging demographic being difficult to sustain ( less workers supporting more retirees , this is n't an anglo saxon conspiracy , unless you consider math to be a conspiracy ) , i can only conclude that you are either poorly informed , or are willfully ignorant . 
  this article is not full of crap . 
  it 's painting a negative picture of finland and you ca n't handle it because he is pointing out flaws . 
  burying your head in the sand wo n't solve anything .
