  i do n't care why they did it actually , i just care that they did . 
  of course the us is acting in its interests . 
  but the us and europe 's interests align quite often . 
  so why is it of utmost concern to you what the us 's interests are if it coincides with the interests of your nation ? 
  perhaps the other countries are in desperate need of cash , and need to go cap in hand begging germany for money . 
  they go along with it because they lack leverage , and thus have no choice but to go along with it . 
  i am not sure how much longer they will continue to do so though . 
  it seems many in europe are really pissed off now at how germany is clearly rigging the system in such a way that seriously exacerbates all the pre-existing domestic problems of those nations . 
   the ttip is also shit and we should stop it until it is full and public information and can then be judged on its merits . 
  why are you holding ttip to a standard that no other trade agreement is held to . 
  trade negotiations between states are always secret . 
   reduced cost of living is the cost of living cheaper in france though ? 
  i was under the impression that it was higher for rent , fuel , and food . 
  i 'm not too sure though . 
  aw man . 
  why is my country always the metric ? 
  why is n't this a map of gdp per capita of eu vs. canada or eu vs. australia ? 
  stop comparing yourselves to us all the time !, 
  that queen is smoking hot . 
  she 's way better looking than britain 's queen . 
  it 's ranked as percentage of total population . 
  canada appears to have lost slightly more people as a percentage of their population . 
  or at least that is what it looks like to me as i squint at a small chart on my phone . 
  the us forced baltic nations to join nato ? 
  that is simply revisionist history . 
  i would hope they just think we 're exaggerating . 
  although it does n't help to propagate the myth that we suffer in a profound way that does n't occur in other wealthy nations . 
  especially since it is demonstrably false . 
  europeans feast on negative anecdotes about the us . 
  why feed into those myths . 
  you 're such an idiot . 
  us citizens enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world , and the highest average over the last century . 
  how can you be so obtuse ? 
  your simply beyond redemption , and i 'm glad my patriotism bothers you . 
   it 's pretty creepy that even after everything the us has done that they still sing the national anthem about the `` land of the free and the home of the brave '' at a simple regional sport event . 
  that 's like flemings singing `` de vlaamse leeuw '' in a simple football match between bruges and ghent . 
  it 's not creepy at all . 
  and it 's not just the us that does it . 
  hell , this post is on the front page of / r/canada right now : http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/26pgj3/o_canada_at_bell_centre_sun_by_fans_sens_vs_habs/ it 's canadians singing their national anthem at a regular nhl game . 
  is that creepy to you ? 
   maybe you do n't cross them but both you and i know a lot of your compatriots are hyper nationalistic hyper-nationalistic ? 
  really ? 
  where and why do you have that impression . 
  this is simply patriotism . 
  a love for our country . 
  i honestly think you do not understand the nuances of patriotism here . 
  it is hard to explain the feeling behind the love for our country , and it is never to be confused with an unquestioning love for our government . 
  hell , the most patriotic segment of our country * hate * the government and everything it does . 
   the us nationalism can get obnoxious and pretentious at times . 
  dude , i see comments on / r/europe * all * the time that put our nationalism to shame . 
  plus , we do n't really give a damn if you find it obnoxious . 
  we love our country , and we do n't need to justify it to anyone . 
  we could n't give a shit less if it bothered you europeans . 
  that 's your problem . 
  and your incessant nagging and finger wagging at us for having the audacity to love our country gets ** really fucking obnoxious and extremely pretentious ** at times . 
  if you wan na really piss an american off , tell him how he should feel about his own country . 
  that wo n't go over very well . 
  the state can do evil stuff because of a tradition to sing the national anthem before some sports events ? 
  you seriously have no idea the role patriotism/tradition plays in the us . 
  just because we sing the national anthem does n't mean we blindly endorse everything our government does . 
  love of country = / = love of government . 
  those can be , and indeed are , two totally different things . 
   call it whatever you want , in the end it drills some form of loyalty in citizens why is this a bad thing ? 
  who are those people ? 
  why are you stirring up such a shit storm ? 
  this thread had nothing to do with the us until you started hurling accusations that everyone hates us . 
  i understand your point , but it hardly seems relevant in this context . 
  are you a little bitter that memorial day weekend is over , and you have to work again whilst nursing a hangover ? 
  here you go comrade :  russia 's military modernisation : putin 's new model army  ** money and reform have given russia armed forces it can use **  this week vladimir putin said he had ordered 40,000 of his troops , strung along the border with ukraine since march , back to barracks . 
  as with two previous similar `` orders '' , there was little sign of an immediate withdrawal . 
  russia 's president may indeed wish to avoid a ground invasion . 
  but the deployment of large numbers of well-equipped , combat-ready troops has proved useful , to intimidate and provide psychological support for the destabilisation of eastern ukraine by pro-russian separatists . 
  for mr putin , this amply justifies the painful and expensive military modernisation he began nearly seven years ago . 
  any illusion that russia could be a partner of nato and the west has gone . 
  this has brought the realisation that what kind of forces mr putin has and the uses he might put them to matter . 
   it is an article of faith for the russian president that a great power must be able to project military force . 
  he sees the modernisation of russia 's armed forces as a vital national interest . 
  yet it was not until his second term that reform began . 
  money had been found to maintain strategic nuclear forces . 
  but russia 's conventional forces were almost useless , based on the soviet model of mass mobilisation , top-heavy with officers and dependent on miserable conscripts stuck in crumbling barracks and equipped with worn-out kit . 
   a first step was the appointment as defence minister in early 2007 of anatoly serdyukov , a 45-year-old former furniture salesman who was once part of mr putin 's st petersburg clique . 
  something of a bulldozer , mr serdyukov was not afraid to take on the military top brass . 
  but the real catalyst for modernisation was the 2008 war in georgia . 
  the brief campaign confirmed mr putin 's belief that russia could use hard power in its near-abroad without risking a military response from the west . 
  but it also laid bare the army 's failings . 
  ian brzezinski of the atlantic council says : `` the sloppy performance was a ` come to jesus ' moment in the kremlin . '' russia achieved its goals , but with difficulty against a tiny foe . 
   mr serdyukov smashed through the remaining resistance . 
  the size of the armed forces would be cut from 1.2 m to about 1m . 
  the bloated officer corps was to be slimmed by almost 50 % , while the creation of well-trained ncos became a priority . 
  conscription would stay , but better pay and conditions would create a more professional army . 
  the reforms replaced the old four-tier command system of military districts , armies , divisions , and regiments with a two-tier system of strategic commands and leaner , more mobile combat brigades . 
  nikolas gvosdev of the us naval war college says : `` the intention was to be able to throw force around in the region and create ` facts on the ground . '''  [ the rivals ( military spending as % of gdp ) ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/20140524_euc027.png )  a fast-rising defence budget provided more money for maintenance and training , allowing large-scale exercises to become routine , while funding pensions and housing for retired officers . 
  mr serdyukov also set out to instil better accountability and to attack corruption that , by some estimates , was siphoning off a third of the equipment budget . 
  but the biggest reform was a ten-year weapons-modernisation programme launched in 2010 , at a cost of $ 720 billion . 
  the aim was to go from only 10 % of kit classed as `` modern '' to 70 % by 2020 . 
  according to ihs jane 's , russia 's defence spending has nearly doubled in nominal terms since 2007 . 
  this year alone it will rise by 18.4 % . 
   reform backed by money has transformed russia 's military effectiveness . 
  progress has continued even though mr serdyukov was replaced 18 months ago ( ironically , after a corruption scandal ) by the more emollient sergei shoigu . 
  yet attempts to create a more professional force and better ncos have been only partly successful .
