  * `` why the hell did you post that online !, 
  '' * that 's what i am guessing they would say . 
  i do n't even think think the author of this article is even trying to be credible . 
  if you are trying to write a persuasive opinion piece , you may want to leave things like this out of article :  poland , ** the eager american servant that it has been ** ( that 's just the first sentence ! ), 
   this means that poland has formally extended its covert and diplomatic reach nearly 300 miles into the interior of ukraine , and that its intelligence services are obviously doing more in ukraine than just ` helping the wounded ' ** ( terrorists ) ** so all of them are terrorists ? 
   the ukrainian fascists are taking on disturbingly similar characteristics to the jihadists in syria talk to me again when ukrainians are beheading each other , and systemic slaughter becomes so common it is not even news worthy anymore . 
   in a similar fashion , both insurgent groups have taken over border control posts connected to their * patron state * , and this move obviously increases the ease with which ankara and warsaw can funnel arms , personnel , and materials to their * subversive spawn * . 
  all must tremble before the polish empire !, 
   poland can be said to be flirting with extreme far-right nationalists in ukraine through its statements of support for the violent opposition and its recent decision to evacuate and help the * wounded insurgents * this guy needs to try a little harder to hide his obvious bias , otherwise he sounds like he was simply handed a script straight out of russia 's propaganda department . 
  never . 
  in fact , this is perfect timing . 
  well you have to understand that even in the most toxic moments of our political system , virtually everything that the citizens of the us require from the government remain unchanged and functioning at a high level . 
  the biggest political crisis our country has seen in 2 decades resulted in national parks closing for a week or so , and that is about the only effect it had . 
  everything else stayed functioning . 
  there is no way to tell as an ordinary american that anything in washington was amiss , since we were n't effected by it . 
  even in the most bitterest of debates , issues still get resolved , they are just a little more messier . 
  to be honest with you , i have little complaints about how my country is being run . 
  from my perspective , things seem to running damn well right now . 
  the economy is pretty solid , and this was mostly due to government involvement in the economy , so in this light it seems to me that the us government is actually much more effective than a number of other countries in europe that seem to still be grappling with the effects of the financial crisis that occurred 5 years ago . 
  the political debates can be loud and obnoxious , but that is mostly a media driven thing that sensationalizes issues for more viewers . 
  you also seem to think that the entirety of the us political system is driven from the federal government . 
  this is an oversight . 
  much of what actually effects a typical us citizen come the state government . 
  state governments also function much better than the federal government since they are smaller units , and usually have less diversity in views across the spectrum . 
  so if you think that the federal government appears sloppy and incoherent , just remember that the state governments are rarely in the news for dysfunction , and it is these local governments that have the largest effects on people 's lives . 
  fair enough . 
  the context was n't that clear me to me . 
  i think the terrible shape of the political landscape is a little over blown , but it would be foolish to suggest that everything is working as smoothly as it could be . 
  your initial comment was a little sensationalist , so i kind of took exception to it . 
  anyway , i would rather not launch into a debate about the health of the political system right now , and you are certainly entitled to your own opinion . 
  cheers . 
   and look how terrible it turned out . 
  maybe it 's your news outlets that are biased . 
  the us is not in terrible shape at all . 
  i mean it 's actually a fantastic place to live ... you might have known that if you had ever been instead of blindly taking everything you see about the us from reddit and movies as the gospel . 
   americans basically see those two wars as poor allocations of resources in a time of scarcity . 
  the idea that america can shape the world has been replaced by the idea that it 's pointless to try . 
  this is a very succinct description of the prevailing attitude i see in this country . 
  i do n't know a soul who thinks we should be involved with any conflicts outside our borders . 
  our nation is isolated , our continent is secure and peaceful , and almost always has been . 
  what happens outside of north america might as well be imaginary . 
  our engagements with the outside world have come with some successes , and disastrous failures , yet the whole time nothing really changed at home . 
  this feeds into the mentality that what we do `` over there '' will never have an effect on what happens `` over here '' . 
  apathy is becoming a mainstream ideology . 
  that is depressingly true . 
  but there really is n't an american version of / r/europe . 
  most of the other subs have specific themes to them as well . 
  this sub discusses a range of topics pertaining to europe and the links are in various formats ( pictures , articles , videos etc. . . ) . 
  there really is n't anything similar for americans . 
  so i would n't group a sub like adviceanimals ( which i guess is american centric ) to this one . 
  i think the world 's cultural diversity will continue to act as a brake on a nation 's cinema industry since the quality inherently diminishes as you try to appeal to broader groups of people . 
  they may rival hollywood , but i do n't know if they will surpass hollywood . 
  i 'm aware of this . 
  keep in mind our salaries are high too though . 
  also , that number might be skewed upwards if it is just the average debt . 
  medical school and law school are ludicrously expensive , but are also ludicrously lucrative . 
  just remember these things when you think about it since it puts things in perspective . 
  dumb movies sell better overseas as well . 
  action movies with little dialog and flashy scenes translate better into various cultures/languages than movies with more dialog and local cultural themes and references . 
  not all people go through that . 
  graduating near the top of your class gets you good scholarships in most states . 
  i graduated in the top 20 % of my class and paid nothing for my degree . 
  i even got thousands of dollars in grants on top of that . 
  i knew plenty of people who got full rides in college . 
  i 'm not saying people here do n't go into debt , i 'm just suggesting that there is much more nuance to the story . 
  i was speaking of an extremely hypothetical situation . 
  i do n't think you are going to get the greatest , unbiased answers in this sub . 
  then again , the only american centric sub i know of is / r/murica , which would be far worse since it is a satirical sub . 
  if you wanted to get actual answers i suggest you google that question . 
  if you 're looking for what europeans think about this question , then i guess you 've come to the right place . 
  fine ... 
  there may be some people in the press mocking the situation . 
  but do n't think for a second that someone in the us ( defense/intelligence agencies ) would n't be casting a weary eye upon the situation . 
  it would still be at least a little uncomfortable . 
  and if you do not agree , then i do n't think you understand just how seriously the us takes regional stability and cohesion . 
  the us would never stand for a nation in north america to not be aligned with the us . 
  i highly disagree . 
  hell , if there were russian/chinese mps in ottawa i would expect there to be * a lot * of concern in washington . 
  we would take this * very seriously * . 
   it could n't deal with a direct conflict in somewhere like ukraine . 
  how the hell do you know ? 
  it seems as if under estimating russian resolve/capabilities is a historic past time for europeans . 
  except that has usually led to absolute catastrophes for the european countries involved . 
  how could you guys continue to write them off so arrogantly ? 
  we would be laughing more if the people we see asking for american-style involvement in ukraine wanted to do it with european resources . 
  instead , we see europeans `` acting full americano '' and `` start begging for military conquest '' with american resources . 
  it 's not something we are laughing about . 
  it 's something we are seeing with astonishing disbelief . 
   it would be more like the liberation of france from the nazis in wwii than of the liberation of aghanistan from the taliban in 2003 . 
  there would probably be victory parades and ukrainian women throwing themselves at us soldiers . 
  this is pure fantasy . 
  ukraine is divided . 
  not only do i doubt ukrainians would see the us as liberators , around half would see us as invaders/occupiers . 
  remember , there were millions of iraqis ( mostly kurds ) that indeed saw us as liberators ... but there were millions more that hated us for what we did to their country . 
  us involvement in ukraine can only end in worsening the situation . 
  someone else will have to help this time . 
   and alabama is still a third world state alabama has a gdp slightly lower than finland , with almost a million less people : [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_between_u.s._states_and_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) have you ever been there , or are you just talking out of your ass ? 
  there is n't even a fence along much of the border . 
  the only thing discouraging illegal migrants from coming here is that it is a rather long walk through the desert . 
   * hollande did a state visit to the usa where he did meet some ` entrepreneurs ' wich prompted a huge outrage from our leftists .
