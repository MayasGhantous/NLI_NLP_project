  huh , interesting . 
  even the link you posted has this to say under the `` foreing perspectives '' section :  americans often liken the nordic model to a kind of `` hybrid '' economics which features a blend of capitalist and socialist visions . 
  [ 28 ] according to sociologist lane kenworthy , in the context of the nordic model , `` social democracy '' refers to a set of policies intended to improve capitalism as opposed to a system to replace capitalism . 
  [ 29 ] kenworthy advocates for the u.s. to make a gradual transition to an economic system similar to those of the nordic countries . 
  [ 30 ] senator bernie sanders ( i-vt ) has been a strong proponent of the nordic system . 
  [ 31 ] [ 32 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model#foreign_perspectives so do you think the us hates this system ? 
  well it 's not quite the way it works . 
  it 's not just those particular states that have good jobs and industry . 
  virtually every state does , so there really are n't too many reasons to move there unless you want to for the lifestyle or weather or something . 
  and many companies have regional facilities in other states too , so if a company has its headquarters in california , chances are they have an office in your state also . 
  plus , california and new york are expensive states to host a business in , so other states are more desirable for companies . 
  hell , i live in peoria , illinois . 
  it has a population of about 100,000 people . 
  yet it also has the headquarters of caterpillar here ( and about a dozen other facilities besides just the headquarters ) . 
  it 's one of the largest companies in the world . 
  and they higher * tons * of locals with great salaries . 
  point is , a lot of states can say something similar about having significant industries there . 
  although i did move from arizona to illinois for a job , a lot of people do n't necessarily leave the state they live in because they * have to * , many leave because they * want to * . 
  the only real brain drain that occurs is small towns to cities i guess . 
  there really is n't a whole lot of brain drain from certain states to others . 
  that 's a damn shame . 
  how is this week response going down in your country ? 
  are the people feeling resignation ? 
  anger ? 
  apathy ? 
  i think i would be angry , but with a feeling of helplessness that there is not much my country could do . 
  holy fucking shit , it is him !, 
  thanks for pulling through with the source . 
  i was mostly joking when i asked if it was gortat . 
  that 's awesome . 
  in case of paywall :  russia 's import ban on polish fruit and vegetables will leave poland with a big surplus of apples by the end of the year . 
  last year 677,000 tonnes of polish apples went to russia , accounting for 56 % of poland 's apple exports . 
  this year poland was able to export its apples to russia only until august 1st , when russia imposed an import ban . 
   poles have responded by celebrating the forbidden fruit , encouraging people via a social-media campaign on facebook and youtube ( pictured ) to `` eat apples to annoy putin '' . 
  intermarch\u00e9 , a chain of supermarkets , is planning to send 40 tonnes of apples to kaliningrad , the russia enclave that shares a border with poland , drawing humorous comparisons with russia 's recent `` humanitarian convoy '' to eastern ukraine . 
   from tallinn to warsaw , moscow 's latest trade sanctions arouse strong emotions . 
  russia is `` a totally untrustworthy and unpredictable business partner , '' said dalia grybauskait\u0117 , lithuania 's president , on august 8th , the day after russia imposed a wide-ranging ban on food products from the european union and other countries . 
  in estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland , food producers and politicians expected the ban . 
  but this does n't mean they were ready when it was imposed . 
   the ban could cost polish farmers $ 500m ( $ 659m ) , according to estimates by poland 's ministry of agriculture . 
  in the three baltic states , where food exports to russia represent a smaller fraction of overall exports , dairy producers will be among the most affected . 
  road hauliers who drive food to russia will feel it too . 
  evaldas gustas , lithuania 's minister of the economy , said that the effects of the ban `` will not be extensive '' , but that it could reduce lithuania 's gdp growth by 0.2 percentage points if it lasts . 
  taavi r\u00f5ivas , estonia 's prime minister , pointed out in an interview that ordinary russian consumers will have to make the biggest sacrifice . 
   not only trade with russia has been affected : four days after the ban was announced , pieno zvaigdzes , lithuania 's second-largest producer of dairy products , stopped taking deliveries from one of latvia 's largest milk producer cooperatives , citing force majeure . 
   governments are trying to help . 
  riga will grant tax holidays to latvian companies that export more than 10 % of their products to russia , among other measures . 
  warsaw has been discussing ways to help cider producers , though it has decided to keep the excise tax on the alcoholic beverage . 
  poland is banking on farmers receiving compensation from brussels , though marek sawicki , a farmer , was not impressed by the european commission 's offer of $ 125m . 
  `` we 'll keep fighting , '' he said . 
  mr sawicki is based in jab\u0142onka , a village in southern poland whose name comes from the polish word for apple tree . 
   with russia 's veterinary and phytosanitary services becoming increasingly capricious and arbitrary in their assessments of foreign foods , some producers may have no choice but to try and sell their products elsewhere . 
  warsaw is trying to convince washington to open the american market to polish apples . 
  but america 's strict standards for food imports , and the likely opposition of american farmers , mean it could be a long wait . 
   meanwhile , four weeks into the ban , and with the apple season around the corner , poles do n't appear to be eating more apples . 
  despite the #jedzjab\u0142ka ( eat apples ) campaign on social media , apple growers and supermarkets say they are selling the same amount as before . 
  to counteract the ban , poles would have to start eating twice as many apples , doubling their annual consumption to 30kg each . 
  by the way , is that [ marcin gortat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marcin_gortat ) in that picture ? 
   i personally know 100 's of people in ukraine that are ready to join the armed forces and fight off russia . 
  serious question . 
  what are they waiting for ? 
  why have n't they joined already ? 
  in case of paywall . 
  i also linked the other articles mentioned in this article . 
  if anyone wants me to paste the content here if those are paywalled as well , just ask . 
   just a few months ago the euro zone 's leaders believed that , having weathered the storm , they were set fair at last . 
  buoyed by the promise of mario draghi , the president of the european central bank , to do `` whatever it takes '' to support the currency , confidence had seeped back into the continent . 
  growth seemed to be returning , albeit at a slow pace . 
  troubled peripheral countries were recovering , after bail-outs and painful measures to cut budget deficits and improve competitiveness . 
  unemployment , especially among the young , was still desperately high , but at least in most countries it was falling . 
  and bond spreads had narrowed sharply , as financial markets stopped betting that the euro would fall apart . 
   it was an illusion . 
  in recent weeks the countries of the euro zone have begun to take in water once again . 
  their collective gdp stagnated in the second quarter : italy fell back into outright recession , french gdp was flat and even mighty germany saw an unexpectedly large fall in output ( [ see article ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21614178-germanys-economy-stutters-even-if-fundamentals-are-strong-watching-wages ) ) . 
  the third quarter looks pretty unhealthy , partly because the euro zone will suffer an extra drag from western sanctions on russia . 
  meanwhile , inflation has fallen perilously low , to around 0.4 % , far below the near-2 % target of the european central bank , raising fears that the zone as a whole could fall prey to entrenched deflation . 
  german bond yields are hovering below 1 % , another harbinger of falling prices . 
  the euro zone stands ( or wobbles ) in stark contrast with america and britain , whose economies are enjoying sustained growth . 
   what started more than four years ago as a banking and sovereign-debt crisis has decayed into a growth crisis that is now enveloping the three biggest economies . 
  germany is teetering on the edge of recession . 
  france is mired in stagnation . 
  italy 's gdp is barely above its level when the single currency came in 15 years ago . 
  since these three countries account for two-thirds of euro-zone gdp , growth in places like spain and the netherlands can not make up for their torpor . 
   the underlying causes of europe 's new ills are three very familiar and interrelated problems . 
  first , there is a shortage of political leaders with the courage and conviction to push through structural reforms to improve competitiveness and , eventually , reignite growth : the big countries have wasted the two years bought by mr draghi 's `` whatever it takes '' commitment . 
  second , public opinion is not convinced of the urgent need for deep and radical changes . 
  and third , despite mr draghi 's efforts , the monetary and fiscal framework is too tight , throttling growth -- which makes structural reforms harder . 
   ** clouseaunomics **  different manifestations of these problems can be seen across the euro zone . 
  but the country that most dramatically epitomises all three is france . 
  this week its embattled socialist president , fran\u00e7ois hollande , was forced to reshuffle his government to eject arnaud montebourg who , despite being economy minister , was his own side 's most persistent critic from the left ( [ see article ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21614173-getting-rid-its-leftists-fran-ois-hollande-has-created-more-cohesive-government ) ) . 
  mr hollande , who came to office in 2012 promising a painless future , is hardly a thatcherite reformer . 
  but since he appointed manuel valls as prime minister in march , he has at least embraced the principle of public-spending cuts , lower taxes and structural reforms . 
   n theory a new and more cohesive reforming government could make progress , but public opinion is not remotely prepared for that . 
  mr hollande is not just deeply unpopular ; unlike italy 's matteo renzi , who has bravely made the case for ( as yet undelivered ) tough reforms , the french president has failed to convince voters that painful change , including a reduction in the size of the state , is inevitable . 
  instead , mr montebourg and his chums offer the beguiling notion that , if only the euro zone scraps its rules and allows bigger budget deficits and generous enough public spending , no more painful reforms will be needed , because the economy will miraculously lift itself out of danger by its own bootstraps . 
   mr montebourg 's argument is all the more seductive because he is right about europe 's third problem : excessive austerity , largely forced on the continent by germany . 
  mr draghi has just implicitly conceded that fiscal and monetary policy in the euro zone is too tight at the annual economics jamboree in jackson hole . 
  he hinted that he was in favour of quantitative easing , which both america and britain have used , and he called for fiscal policy to do more to encourage growth -- a message plainly aimed at germany 's chancellor , angela merkel . 
  she is the leader who insists most firmly on sticking to the euro zone 's rules on fiscal discipline , just as it is the german bundesbank that is most strongly against quantitative easing . 
   ** angie , we can say you never tried **  despite the gloom , there should be scope here for a bargain .
