  that 's why . 
  i wish the us would take 40 % of my paycheck as opposed to the ~ 15 % i paid last year . 
  and i really wish we paid triple the price for gasoline as well . 
  that would really inspire me to spend more money . 
  hopefully they can enlighten our players by bringing with them their european tradition flopping . 
   i 'm interesting . 
  thanks for slipping that in there . 
  i always imagined you were a rather boring person . 
  now i know otherwise . 
   ... but that they are using the tax to cover up for a problem . 
  this right here is the source of virtually every tax increase and that should be on the mind of every citizen whenever their government suggests a new tax . 
  the government should be asked `` why do you need this new source of revenue ? 
  is it really to discourage a form of business , or is it to try and desperately patch holes in the budget because you are incapable of spending within your means ? 
  and what is the reason for the timing of this tax ? 
  if there has always been an issue , why are you taxing it now ? '', 
  i 'm all for taxes being used for the essentials . 
  but if every year your government is rolling out new taxes , which inherently rob the citizen of their money , then there is a problem . 
  there should be a burden of proof on the government to justify any tax . 
  fine . 
  your loss . 
  do n't worry too much about the stalking . 
  you should consider it flattering . 
   ... it is getting crazy over here . 
  it 's always been that way . 
  the continuous increase in craziness is what our nation aspires to . 
  so if greece can see the light at the end of the tunnel , does that mean you will be returning soon , or have you grown comfortable in the us ? 
  true . 
  they are both voluntary and arbitrary . 
  you could also put the 3 % deficit limit in their too . 
  it 's a good number to stick to , but it is still completely arbitrary . 
  it 's unfortunate to see you get downvoted because you provided details that suggested taking examples from america . 
  i wish this sub reddit was n't contaminated with useless pride that punishes anyone that mentions anything positive about the us . 
  but , such is the state of affairs here . 
  i understand that . 
  but just by invoking similar language invokes a broadly similar idea for what the end game should look like . 
  even if it is a convenient simplification , it still conveys an image you can compare to a historical precedent . 
  it is inaccurate , but the comparison is continuously dragged our . 
  i think the comparison is as misplaced as at is wrong and damaging . 
   `` let 's abandon this perspective - this will discourage the 0.01 % of the people who are federalist - ** and let us not compare ourselves to the united states ** , '' he said . 
  this quote should be the creed of this sub reddit . 
  america is not europe , and europe is not america . 
  any attempts to equate the two sidelines centuries of history and culture . 
  to put american colonies with only a few decades of history and broadly shared a similar culture in the same breath of dozens of unique nation states with 1000 years of independent culture is a disservice to everyone . 
  us americans carved out a country out of pre-existing british colonies . 
  you europeans ( if you desire to fedaralize ) face a significantly taller task . 
  keep in kind mind it took us considerable struggle and eventually a civil war to keep our union together ... and we mostly spoke the same language and did n't have the thousands of years of history of war and conflict as a back drop during the evolution of our country . 
  if this is what even a fraction of europeans desire ... good luck . 
  but to even make loose connections between the historical/cultural circumstances between the inflection points in our respective continents ' trajectory is to do a great disservice to human history . 
  some twitter users are the endless source of / r/europe circle jerks . 
  wow . 
  you guys deserve a pat on the back . 
  i do n't even bother clearing up mispercetions or offering different perspectives anymore . 
  it 's not worth it . 
  collecting turds in my inbox offers little value to me . 
  it 's interesting being an american on this sub reddit . 
  the america presented in this sub reddit is so radically different than the america i have experienced in the 26 years i haved i lived on this planet . 
  most of the time i do n't say anything because the mispercetions are hilarious . 
  but this post ... really ? 
  it seems like the only purpose of it is to sew the seeds of a circle jerk . 
  oh well , people will believe what they want to believe i guess . 
  well do you consider that a good thing , a bad thing , or just a necessary thing ? 
  obviously some decisions must be made at the highest level , but i would be very concerned if more and more decisions were being made at that level to the point where a nation 's government simply becomes a rubber stamp machine for the eu . 
  it would be one thing if those in power had a track record of competency , efficiency , and success . 
  but the longer this mess in the ez continues , the more skeptical i would be of surrendering more sovereignty . 
  it 's unfortunate to see this comment get so many down votes . 
  you basically said `` why should my country comply with the orders of a representative from a foreign country who demonstrates questionable judgement at best , and dubious motives at worst '' . 
  it is a fundamental question that warrants discussion , not down votes and being ignored . 
  hopefully some of those silent dissenters will address that question with some substance , instead of just brushing you off . 
  i would be asking the same questions if i lived in europe . 
  fucking france . 
  reading that was like reading the rant of a chocolate starved woman on her period . 
  not gon na lie , i got a patriot chub reading that . 
  you 've obviously never been to texarkana . 
  you 'd still have a boner . 
  what is `` danesgiving '' ? 
  that sounds way better than the shitty thanksgiving i am used to . 
  you could double up and get a handgun with a bayonette to be extra bad ass . 
  then you might be an [ arizona gunslinger ] ( http://www.azgunslinger.com/ ) kinda guy . 
  do you honestly think companies in the us sue every single software company in the country ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  in fact , i 'm pretty sure it 's safe to say most companies do n't get sued . 
  i think your fear is greatly exaggerated . 
  you 're not exactly apple or samsung . 
  because no software companies have ever been started in the us . 
  oddly enough , there is a regular poster here that is an american that started a software company in california . 
  there is arguably no * better * place to start a software company than the us . 
  the access to capital and talent is unrivaled in america . 
   wolfgang schaeuble said two of cyprus 's big banks are being propped up solely by emergency liquidity from the european central bank that is contingent on all sides agreeing on a rescue package . 
   '' ** someone needs to explain this to the cypriots ** , '' mr schaeuble told german public television zdf . 
  allow me . 
  you 're fucked . 
  this will be a flop . 
  are you guys seriously trying to compete with ` murica ? 
  this will just be embarassing . 
  usa !, 
  usa !, 
  usa !, 
  it looks like you 're some sort of half breed . 
  i 'd go with half gypsy , half sicilian . 
  2 points : 1 ) very misleading title 2 ) krugman .
