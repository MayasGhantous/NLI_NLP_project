my specific surname is actually a very tiny part of my heritage on just the purely paternal line . 
  i have an english surname , but all the other surnames ( maiden names ) in my family tree are french and filipino . 
  btw i 've personally never done a dna test , i just rely on geneology records . 
  i 've always translated ethnicity in french as * origine * . 
  i would translate that as `` my nationality is french , but my ethnicity is not french '' . 
  and then there are people who say `` je suis belge mais je suis d'origine fran\u00e7aise '' , which i would translate as `` my nationality is belgian but i am ethnically french '', 
  sometimes we want to read medieval history and be able to identify with a country as `` our own history '' . 
  but america did n't exist back then so the least arbitrary way to decide the country is ancestry . 
  is it like [ this ] ( http://www.rempros.com/comparison/natural-slate-vs-clay-tile-roof.html ) ? 
  ** p\u00e9tain ** ptain ** putain ** ** putin ** poutin ** poutine **, 
  dating in france is something that confuses me . 
  one french person on ask.fm once told me that people in france have multiple boyfriends and girlfriends , but i feel like that person might have been trolling me , because most other french people have told me that they are monogamous . 
  would have been 50/50 but my thumb was too big and clicked maryland even though i pressed delaware . 
  my home , 
  82 % because the balkans and the baltics . 
  i always know estonia is the northernmost baltic state , but i confuse lithuania and latvia . 
  they were significant in 19th century spain https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilustrado, 
  i have 5 french flags just in my room, 
  i bet it 's this  barre toi !, 
   me dis pas que t ` es pas au courant , t ` as pas vu ? 
  `` charleroi c'est un trou paum\u00e9 '' i will always remember this quote a belgian girl told me when she was telling me where she lives , 
  it 's a quote from a movie i just watched . 
  the fact it 's in french is not important , but i suggest bavaria , 
  i assumed he spoke [ old frankish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankish_language ) , a language that evolved into dutch . 
  i did n't know he spoke old high german . 
  learn something new every day . 
  i want to be an english teacher in france but it will take me a very long time . 
  i have the necessary education but i will need to have 5 years of residence to become a citizen so i can be eligible to take the capes exam . 
  during those 5 years i plan to be a teaching assistant and/or work at a private language institute , but i ca n't get a permanent teaching job until i take the capes exam . 
  technically the language most related to frankish is dutch . 
  not german or french :p, 
  i have n't been to any so you can take my opinion with a grain of salt . 
  i 'm just relying on the images of italian cities i 've seen throughout my life . 
  venice is probably the most beautiful, 
  yeah, 
  what if you pass but your spouse/partner fails ? 
  i like that the norwegian flag ( the red part of it ) and the swedish flag ( the yellow part of it ) both match my synesthesia for the first letters of their names . 
  makes it really easy for me to remember their flags . 
  how do the french feel about asians ? 
  several times i 've had interactions like this with french people ( only on sites like ask.fm though , not in person . 
  french people have never acted this way to me in person ) : - bonjour - bonjour . 
  i understood that sentence just from knowing english and french ( for the last word ) . 
  generally , a dialect is a regional variant of a language and is not considered a separate language . 
  for example quebec french is a dialect of french . 
  i 'm majoring in french and one of my french classes at university was entirely about analyzing the king arthur texts . 
  no single country would be that . 
  each country would probably have its own little region like that . 
  a state is not equivalent to a country . 
  a state is equivalent to a region of a country . 
  i think they said i can vote by tweeting . 
  i just wan na make sure if i heard right . 
  what a coincidence lol . 
  i was just watching the music video on youtube but it 's the same song that was currently playing live . 
  i 'm just watching the music videos on youtube, 
  listening to requiem right now . 
  i wish more countries would sing in their native languages like france does . 
  how do i vote ? 
  is it too late ? 
  to any french people : how acceptable is mademoiselle ? 
  is it on fr\u00e4ulein levels or is it still acceptable ? 
  english language, 
  i love paris, 
  at first i read that as `` use a nuke to eradicate paris '', 
  anyways , as an american of filipino heritage who is planning to move to france , i feel you . 
  first there was duterte , then trump , then almost le pen . 
  i 'm ashamed of all three of those politicians . 
  how did you get it to say that ? 
  americans have meddled in foreign elections too . 
  i 'm not denying that . 
  i consider it corrupt no matter which country does it . 
  yes, 
   russian corruption largely only really effects russia you unaware of their meddling in foreign elections ? 
  if you were below 12 it 's fine . 
  when i was a little kid i thought hitler was black because another kid in my class did a presentation on him and for some reason included a picture of the emperor of ethiopia . 
  i was n't even born in france but i 'm patriotic about it because it 's the country i 've chosen to live the rest of my life in . 
  you 're so lucky . 
  i 'm going to france this fall and it 's costing me thousands . 
   do europeans know who einstein was ? 
  another brilliant american that you guys should learn about ok now it 's obvious you 're trolling . 
  no one , not even americans , thinks einstein is from america . 
  i feel like immigrants are often the most patriotic . 
  for example i am immigrating to france and i am very in love with the country , but most french people are a bit apathetic about it . 
  y' all created the roman empire . 
  i 'm sure it 's automatic for you , but as a second language speaker , it 's really hard for me to tell apart the accents of france . 
  to tell which accent it is , i have to read about their phonologies on wikipedia and pay really close detail to the person 's pronunciation , paying so much detail to the pronunciation that i often lose track of the actual meaning of the sentence . 
  username checks out, 
  there 's an antioch in my state ( tennessee ) and i 've always assumed it was because it 's at the same latitude as the real antioch , but i 've never been able to confirm if that 's the reason . 
  how do you view montpellier ? 
  it 's because historically there was n't much food available in the pacific , so they adapted by storing more fat . 
  then once modern processed foods became available , they easily became overweight from just a small amount . 
  it 's not even seen as a brand name anymore . 
  for example i just spell it jello . 
  i 'm studying abroad in france this fall , then i 'm coming back to the states , then after i graduate university i 'm gon na live in france permanently . 
  you can replace them with me . 
  i 'm coming to france , 
  monaco, 
  not if it 's diet , 
  i knew a girl who told me she lived '' \u00e0 une heure de paris '' , in seine-et-marne . 
  would she be considered a parisian ? 
  i remember le petit prince in french 1 ( or maybe it was 2 ),
