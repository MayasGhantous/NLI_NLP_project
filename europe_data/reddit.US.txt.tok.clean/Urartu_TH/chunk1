karabakh is historically armenian , yet given to the azerbaijani soviet socialist republic by stalin . 
  you can only post nonsense like this in / r/turkey , otherwise you will be ridiculed and down voted to hell but everyone on reddit , racist boy . 
  here 's a turkish source about turkey 's support for isis : http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-played-part-in-islamic-states-success-commander-says.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=70372&amp;newscatid=359, 
  another pathetic racist down voted to hell . 
  you ca n't post this nonsense anywhere outside / r/turkey and not be ridiculed little buddy . 
  the son of armenian refugees from the genocide in ottoman turkey , my grandfather fought as a greek partisan during the resistance of the german occupation of greece during ww2 . 
  they were more effective in their efforts than failed attempts by the greek government to create a clandestine resistance . 
  they mainly attempted quick attacks against nazi troops originating from the mountains and forests around the city of athens . 
  there was unfortunately petty infighting between multiple resistance groups that hampered their efforts tremendously . 
  i remember stories about a sever lack of supplies and food . 
  he said to survive in winters inside makeshift tents in the mountains and fight with weapons stolen from the germans , the greek government itself or smuggled in from the italian resistance to mussolini . 
  ... witness the resultant societal effects of propaganda and hysteria instead of entirely honest media reporting . 
  it does n't matter how many centuries pass . 
  this will ** never ** go away . 
  nope . 
  no war was taking place in the vast majority of armenian cities in the former ottoman empire . 
  the deaths at khojaly took place during the battle of khojaly . 
  only if land , homes , and stolen monies are returned . 
  all of this comes after a full apology and national mourning period . 
  what 's with you people and kissing ass to turkic dictatorships ? 
  armenian is missing and interestingly the word two is n't similar to the other languages . 
  two is spelled \u0565\u0580\u056f\u0578\u0582 or `` yerku '' or `` erku . '', 
  well well ... now who 's the pompous one ? 
   1 ) i know very well how armenia came to be part of the russian empire . 
  you are literally proving my point correctly . 
  armenia , for thousands of years before , was within the iranian cultural sphere of influence . 
  that 's why armenians are so common in urban iran even today . 
  a comparatively short period under the rule of the russian empire does n't change thousands of years of history . 
  which is exactly why your dumb `` counter-argument '' about greece being under ottoman rule does n't make any sense either ; greece already had a distinct cultural identity and merely switching rulers from byzantines to ottomans does n't get rid of that cultural identity . 
  just like armenia going under russian dominion does n't mean it 's no longer under the iranian cultural sphere . 
  armenians were the first of the indo-iranian peoples to convert to christianity and stay christian . 
  that 's why they are so distinct in iranian culture . 
  first of all , armenians are not `` indo-iranian . '', 
  this is the same misconception many linguists used to have when grouping the armenian language into the iranian branch . 
  now it is clearly defined on it 's own . 
  armenians can be found in the urban areas of many countries . 
  while there may be 100,000 armenians in iran , there are 500,000 in france , 2.5-3 million in russia and 1 million in the usa . 
  greece was under turkic rule for centuries . 
  that has a major effect on culture -- diction , food , manner of speech , dance etc. 
  cultural identity is shaped by those who rule you ( and who may eventually forcibly change your culture ; ie . 
  forcibly turkified armenians throughout centuries of turkic rule over the armenian highlands ) . 
  also need i remind you how islam has corrupted your beautiful culture ? 
  the second language in armenia is russian . 
  there are more armenians now residing in the russian federation than in the republic of armenia . 
  they all have family in armenia and visit regularly . 
  this is not the case with iran , as it is not the case between greece and turkey . 
  i have visited the republic of armenia and can tell you that it only faintly resembles some middle eastern/asian cities ; for the most part its major cities and the culture exhibited by the locals is that of other similar former soviet eastern european states . 
  it seems that you only have an impression of armenians from those you 've met in iran . 
  we are all over the world . 
  furthermore , what separates iranians and armenians today is culture , primarily due to religion . 
   2 ) since you evidently did n't read this at all the first time , let me link it to you again : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_iran hey look i can do that [ too !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_armenia ) how about [ this one !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tigranes_the_great#/media/file:armenian_empire.png )  no , i 'm glad i mentioned it , because it a ) once again proves you do n't really read very much and b ) you have very little grasp of what you 're even . 
  drop the pompous attitude . 
  vank is a totally different beast than just a `` church '' . 
  it 's an important historical cathedral central to the iranian-armenian community and has been for 400 + years . 
  it 's a literal work of art . 
  the word vank in armenian means `` monastery . '', 
  armenians have set up churches and monasteries in various places outside the armenian highland . 
  one happens to be in iran , just as greeks have monasteries ( now defunct ) in turkey . 
  the list i gave you does include some similar sites , where armenian monks work and live . 
  in fact there is one in italy that is still fully functioning , unlike the one in iran . 
  it is at the [ san lazzaro degli armeni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_lazzaro_degli_armeni ) and is called the armenian catholic monastery of san lazzaro . 
  the bell has rung . 
  you are dismissed . 
   there is a big difference between 200 and 2000 years . 
  do n't be dense . 
  greece was only part of the empire for a few years . 
  i was simply mocking your silly argument . 
  eastern armenia has been a part of the russian sphere of influence since the [ treaty of turkmenchay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_turkmenchay ) of 1828 when it became a part of the russian empire . 
  it was then a part of the soviet union . 
  in comparison , greece only gained independence from the ottoman turkish ( islamic ) empire in [ 1829 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_war_of_independence ) . 
  by your logic , greece is culturally turkic and islamic . 
  ( and so are the balkans of course ! ), 
   if you want to go by a cultural basis , armenia is far closer to iran than any european nation . 
  on what basis ? 
  your imagination ? 
   check out vank cathedral in esfahan ... how many european countries have an armenian orthodox cathedral like this ? 
  ah , you should n't have mentioned this . 
  [ armenian churches in traditional europe ] ( http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=armenian_churches_in_europe ) : churches are found in : austria belgium bulgaria cyprus england estonia france germany greece hungary italy latvia netherlands romania russia sweden ukraine, 
  yes , two hundred years ago . 
  if we go back far enough greece was also a part of iran . 
  and ? 
  i 'm assuming the poster sees armenia as european due to language , culture , religion etc. 
  except creating more refugees by arming terrorists . 
  i did n't post that to comment on the picture 's accuracy but rather to note who these `` rebels '' are . 
   in further indications of russian `` mission creep '' in syria , a twitter account linked to jabhat al-nusra , al-qaeda 's syrian branch , published images of what appeared to be russian planes and drones flying over idlib . 
  he 's probably referring to the occupation of iraq and its consequential vacuum that allowed isis to form and spread to syria . 
  anti-erdogan/anti-neo-ottoman news is not necessarily anti-turkish . 
  do n't be so defensive . 
  both sides currently hold land that is n't necessarily legitimate to them . 
  at this point the armenians of karabakh simply wo n't give up any territory . 
  they 've had a functioning republic for two decades . 
  armenia is culturally and politically european . 
  azerbaijan has oil . 
  take back ? 
  it was never theirs to begin with . 
  nagorno karabakh ( artsakh ) has never been a part of an independent azerbaijan . 
  the people of that republic voted for independence from the ussr in a referendum which passed overwhelmingly . 
  the dictator in azerbaijan ( aliyev ) is a delusional mad man .
