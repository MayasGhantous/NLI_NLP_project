  [ here ] ( http://pontosworld.com/index.php/music/instruments/1317-the-daouli-drum ) is an article on it 's potential pontic origins . 
  reread the article . 
  relevant portion : '' ` it [ the resolution ] urges ankara to go further and `` recognize the armenian genocide and thus to pave the way for a genuine reconciliation between the turkish and armenian peoples . ' '', 
  it 's clear that there can be no reconciliation until ankara joins the world community and stops denying the genocide . 
  this is what the eu parliament is also stating . 
  i thought that at first but whilst reading the article the author puts quotes around the term several times . 
  that 's surely intentional and unnecessary . 
  i may sound as though i 'm nitpicking if it was n't for previous instances of turkish pressure on news organizations to use quotes around the term to create an air of doubt . 
  why does a german government news source put genocide in quotes if the bundestag in 2005 resolved the following : `` the bundestag deplores the deeds of the young turkish government in the ottoman empire which have resulted in the almost total annihilation of the armenians in anatolia . '', 
  [ source ] ( http://www.armenian-genocide.org/affirmation.339/current_category.7/affirmation_detail.html ) how much political clout does the turkish government have in germany ? 
  it is the national instrument of armenia . 
  the duduk ( tsiranapogh in armenian ) was played by the world 's foremost duduk artist , jivan gasparyan , in the film gladiator . 
  what ? 
  russia 's [ ria novosti ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/business/article/greece-in-talks-with-russia-to-buy-s-300-missiles-report/519193.html ) news agency is reporting the same . 
  very commendable for using byzantine greek instruments , such as the [ lyra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_lyra ) and the [ daouli ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/davul ) , along with the armenian duduk of course . 
  this really helped personify and , put into context , the melody . 
  guilty conscious + small testicles . 
  it used to include a very well educated , wealthy and large group of people . 
  i wonder what happened to them ? 
  ok . are you saying that the akp is n't trying to precipitate a cultural change in turkey towards islam and conservatism , and away from europe ? 
  * religion must be noted on one 's identification card/driver 's license . 
  * alcohol laws on purchasing and where to drink have been slowly and progressively limited . 
  * more men and women wearing religiously sanctioned clothing push ` conservative values . ', 
  * laws/regulations meant to preserve secularism broken down , such as hijab ban in schools . 
  perhaps a turkish person could answer this more thoroughly . 
   terrorist organizations who want to keep a good rep in europe are not known for claiming responsibility for dead children and civilians . 
  still does n't answer the question . 
   i do n't know . 
  did turkey claim responsibility for it ? 
  the sources are mostly from the west . 
  yes they did and apparently attempted to cover up the issue by providing monetary compensation . 
  also , are you saying that `` the west '' has an anti-turkey bias ? 
  i never said turkey did n't have any cultural similarity to europe . 
  also , do n't discount religion and its influences ... especially with the direction the akp is taking turkey . 
  hmm . . this is n't what you 'd find on this subbreddit nor what i 've noticed amongst europeans generally . 
  culture ( lanauge , food , religion , etc. ), 
  is what makes europeans european . 
  armenia is simply closer in those regards than turkey in many respects . 
  in any case , as i said , the two countries are hybrids . 
  considering how cyprus was allowed into the eu should give you enough evidence of what europe thin about cyprus 's hellenic europeaness . 
   no it is n't state terrorism , they attacked them because they thought they were pkk but they were n't , although pkk makes most its money from drugs . 
  sounds like an israeli justification . 
  i think turkey and armenia are seen as hybrids with armenia being more relatable to europe due to religion and language . 
   on the evening of the second day of the religious fest , a car full of explosives was exploded in the province of gaziantep , killing 9 civilians ( four of them were children ) and wounding 56 . 
  [ 124 ] with this attack , the number of civilian casualties since 2007 reached 65 , including 23 children has pkk claimed responsibility for this ? 
  sources reporting are turkish only . 
  also seems to be the only event where civilians were deliberately killed since the 90 's . 
   december 28 -- 29 : 35 kurdish civilians ( probably smugglers ) , mostly teenagers , were killed by turkish airforce jet bombardment on the turkish-iraqi kurdistan border . 
  is this state-terrorism ? 
  distance between rhodes , greece and the capital of cyprus is [ 261 nautical miles ] ( http://www.distancefromto.net/between/rhodes/nicosia ) . 
  also hellenism has been present there since alexander the great conquered the islands from persia in 300 bc . 
  as far as i can tell the last targeting of civilians was in the 90 's . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong ... 
  cyprus is perhaps culturally majority european ( hellenic ) . 
  nope . 
  for example american revolutionists were not `` terrorists . '', 
  generally terrorism is the targeting of non-combatants for political ends . 
  pkk has renounced such actions , although they 've committed them in the distant past . 
  this . 
  the jail time is a scare tactic for others . 
  same is done with armenian genocide recognizers in turkey , such as nobel lauraette orhan pamuk . 
  i doubt he could actually march against terrorism while supporting isis in syria . 
  not sure how a man could possibly stomach such an inconsistency ; must be pure sociopathy . 
  * cough cough * armenia checking in ... 
  they do n't provide evidence per say , they merely deny the evidence for the figures cited and genocidal intent . 
  they use statements such as `` everything suffered during ww1 '' and nothing more . 
   i did watch it all , the part i 'm interested in is not listening to the spokesmen but looking at where they get their evidence on numbers and the like from . 
  most information is generally gleaned from german , british , american and french archives . 
   there is not much time given to the turkish side to explain their position . 
  did you watch the documentary ? 
  it includes turkish historians from turkey who have studied the issue and do not agree with their government 's denial . 
  it also includes turkish government spokespersons . 
  the documentary was produced by viasat history . 
  `` viasat history is a pan nordic and pan east european television channel showing factual programming on history , culture and society . 
  with headquarters based in london , united kingdom ... '' this documentary is similar to those done by pbs here in the us on this subject . 
  in fact it may be the original pbs documentary simply being shown by viasat . 
  such documentaries are certainly not produced by russia today . 
  phenomenal documentary . 
  she 's [ pretty hot ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rmd9znadp_8/urcypyq9rwi/aaaaaaaaa54/7htpnt7t0by/s1600/ksenia+sobchak+-+54737_kseniya-sobchak_or__1600x1200_%2528www_gdefon_ru%2529.jpg ), 
  that does n't speak to any inconsistency with the article i posted . 
  might be a simple error . 
  there are various groups within india that as a unit consider themselves indian . 
  the thrust of my point is the portion of my response that you ignored with cowardice :  even more importantly in the case of crimeans , it 's language , food , dance , music etc. 
  what else would they define themselves as besides russians in crimea ( what they consider a part of western russia ) ? 
  that is the only definition . 
  religion defining ethnicity ? 
  judaism neighborhood defining ethnicity ? 
  india even more importantly in the case of crimeans , it 's language , food , dance , music etc. 
  what else would they define themselves as besides russians in crimea ( what they consider a part of western russia ) ? 
  perhaps you do n't understand the word : ethnicity : an ethnic group or ethnicity is a socially defined category of people who identify with each other based on common ancestral , social , cultural or national experience, 
  there 's a difference between politicians and small business owners i think ... 
  i 'm not sure that it 's only one person . 
   hate mail sent to a greek restaurant in the western german city of d\u00fcsseldorf which describes greece as `` corrupt and lazy '' , has received more than 12,000 ` likes ' on facebook and been shared more than 3,000 times . 
   that 's what peacekeepers ate for peacekeepers are useless here when only one side has an interest in warfare and conquest . 
  the ball is in azerbaijan 's court to remove snipers . 
   and the alternative is to literally ethnically cleanse by legitimizing the annexations . 
  also that 's what peacekeepers are for you do n't need peacekeepers if only one side is engaging in creating hostilities . 
  what you need is for that side to stop such aggression and come to the negotiating table . 
   there was likely some back room draw that fell through . 
  that or erdogan tried to use it as leverage by getting so close and then pulling out the rug .
