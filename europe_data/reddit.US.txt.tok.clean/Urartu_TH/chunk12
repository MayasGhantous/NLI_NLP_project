  understand the context first . 
  then get back to me . 
  armenians made huge mistakes in khojaly , but it was not a preplanned massacre . 
   i did but you said it does not count however , the nkr has literally said it will not allow azeris to vote in an independence referendum . 
  if that is not ethnic cleansing i do n't know what is azeris that lived in nkao will be able to vote . 
  when has nkr said otherwise ? 
  what nkr will not agree to the flooding of azeris into nkr to change the demographics such that nkr armenians become a majority , lose the vote and are forced to flee to armenia . 
  let 's not forget that azerbaijan is run by a megalomaniac leader that has said that `` all armenians of the world '' are his enemies . 
   pretty much any academic . 
  look up some scholarly articles on the subject i have . 
  again , people fleeing war are not necessarily ethnically cleansed . 
   dude , you do n't even know what the hell you are talking about if you are using the term meskheti . 
  that 's in georgia . 
  also that is completely irrelevant . 
  intent does not matter , result does meskhetian turks are refugees from central asia that were settled in various parts of the caucusus during the soviet union . 
  some were settled in nkao to help slowly dilute the armenian majority there . 
  also , excessive retaliation and force in response to the shelling of stepanakert without enough warning is not the same as a planned massacre . 
   and ethnic cleansing as the rest were forced to leave by force as a result of war that azerbaijan unleashed when they did n't want to accept the will of the nkao people to secede from the ussr . 
   they created a civilian corridor . 
  that is literally saying get the fuck out what else were they supposed to do when azeris were shelling stepanakert from khojali civilian areas ? 
  they should n't have attempted to warn them ? 
  now obviously whatever warnings were given were not enough and were not transmitted to the populace . 
   a primary source can not determine ethnic cleansing , that is a legal judgement . 
  find a proper source that has done an investigation into the events . 
   you need to calm down with your diaspora nationalism , most armenians will recognize it , i cant believe you wont . 
  no nationalism is involved here . 
  and most armenians do not recognize that azerbaijanis were `` ethnically cleansed '' from areas surrounding nkao . 
  that 's absolute nonsense . 
  you 're getting desperate . 
   and why everybody with any knowledge of what ethnic cleansing is snickering at you right now . 
  what ? 
  who ? 
   literally victim blaming . 
  you can not argue that something is not a massacre because apparently the azeri or something or another . 
  i 'm not blame the meskhetian turkic villagers who died at all . 
  i 'm explaining the sequence of events to you which you clearly do n't know much about . 
   exactly , completely irrelevant . 
  it 's very relevant to the fact that the attack against azeri troops in khojaly resulted in civilian deaths . 
   literally completely irrelevant . 
  if you force civilians out of an area , its ethnic cleansing . 
  zero intent is needed . 
  force them ? 
  armenian warned the azeri side that they were going to attack the areas from which bombs were being lobbed into the ethnic armenia civilian areas in stepanakert . 
   terrible fate : ethnic cleansing in the making of modern europe by benjamin lieberman not a proper cite . 
  cite to a primary source and a specific part of one at that . 
  claiming that people were `` ethnically cleansed '' , which implies a purposeful act , is different than civilians fleeing a war-zone . 
   and the turkish have always claimed the genocide was an accident . 
  except we have scholars who 've studied the subject . 
  that is why the whole world ridicules turkey every april 24th . 
  [ we do know ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khojaly_massacre#warnings_and_the_free_corridor ) that armenians warned that azerbaijani side that unless bombing of stepanakert ended , they would have to attack khojaly . 
  if it 's the case that azerbaijani authorities failed to inform the populace , then open up a different issue altogether . 
  in any case , i think armenians could 've done more before the battle of khojaly to prevent civilian deaths . 
  but again , it was n't a pre-planned attack on civilians . 
   they fled under threat of massacre . 
  you know what that sounds like ... oh wait ethnic cleansing . 
  source ? 
   til the murder of civilians is ok just as long as the other side pisses you off . 
  shit , armenians pissed off the turks , i guess the genocide does not real either !, 
  not what i said . 
  you conveniently fail to mention the bombardment of civilian areas of stepanakert that i linked to which immediately proceeded the battle of khojaly . 
  those civilians were indiscriminantly killed by azerbaijan . 
  the karabakh army has always claimed that they left a corridor open for civilians to leave khojaly before the battle began and sent out leaflets and siren messages . 
  it was n't some pre-planned attack on civilians or indiscriminate bombing , even though i think the armenian side made mistakes in khojaly . 
  the danish mp in question attended and spoke at the [ second global forum against the crime of genocide ] ( http://www.gfyerevan.am/ ) in yerevan . 
  go ahead and tell us how people fleeing the areas surrounding nkao were subjected to ethnic cleansing . 
  you can not . 
  that 's my point . 
  those were not all episodes of ethnic cleansing . 
  you 're use of the term so loosely is shameful . 
  the deaths during the battle of khojaly did not take place in those surrounding areas . 
  do n't attempt to confuse the issue here ( or are you actually confused ? ) . 
  armenians have never denied what happened at khojaly , although the evacuation corridor and announcements that retaliatory bombings would take place there in response to the [ shelling of stepanakert ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shelling_of_stepanakert ) ( where azerbaijan intetionally bombarded armenian civilian areas ) are never mentioned in conjunction . 
  i wonder why there 's been such a regression ? 
  armenians had no intention to have meskhetian turks and azeris leave those areas . 
  armenians of karabakh held a democratic vote via referendum to secede from the ussr and were then attacked by azerbaijan . 
  let 's not use the term `` ethnically cleansed '' so wantonly . 
  if you want to see ethnic cleansing , take a look at the masscares committed by the azerbaijani government against armenians in [ sumgayit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sumgait_pogrom ) , [ kirovabad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kirovabad_pogrom ) , [ maraga ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maraga_massacre ) , [ baku ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baku_pogrom ) . 
  armenia and turkey were set to open the border until turkey reneged after bring pressured by aliyev when [ erdogan visited azerbaijan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenia%e2%80%93turkey_relations#2009_turkish_presidential_visit_to_azerbaijan_and_russia ) . 
  i remember reading that turkish schoolbooks described armenian civilians as having been a `` fifth column '' who `` betrayed '' the ottoman and essentially deserved it . 
  this would naturally engender dislike towards armenians from a young age . 
  the [ extent of misinformation ] ( http://armenianweekly.com/2014/12/04/textbooks/ ) is appalling . 
  you 're referring to anamolous episodes that took place years and sometimes decades ago . 
  99.9 % of armenians push for genocide recognition peaceably . 
  the first step by turkey would be to stop squeezing armenia economically with the closed border . 
  and then stop equivocating on the history of the armenian genocide by shamefully attempting to frame it as a `` civil war . '', 
  to most , it 's infuriating and very disrespectful . 
  in terms of the people-to-people relations , one only needs to remember the [ one hundred thousand mourners ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/dinkfuneral3.jpg ) ( probably mostly turks ) who paid their respects at hrant dink 's funeral . 
  the potential is clearly there . 
  also , in recent years genocide recognition sit-ins and speeches have been taking place in istanbul . 
  what 's bothers me the most , though , is the systematic brainwashing of children by the turkish state via schoolbooks to deny the genocide and dislike armenians . 
  of course he 's not . 
  while recognizing that , how could you say that the armenians hold the keys to armenian genocide recognition at the `` state level '' ( turkish state ? 
  [ northern irish mps ] ( http://news.am/eng/news/12175.html ) have recognized the genocide , sadly unlike the uk house of commons as a whole . 
  the [ irish department of foreign affairs ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/ireland-not-recognising-armenian-massacres-as-genocide-1.2185236 ) also bowed to turkish government pressure last year and did n't use the term `` genocide '' , even if they essentially recognized it . 
  this is of course not enough for armenians . 
  which state ? 
  turkey ? 
  erdogan 's current positions on armenians : [ erdogan 's administration says turkey will never recognize armenian genocide ] ( http://asbarez.com/149173/erdogans-administration-says-will-never-recognize-armenian-genocide/ ) [ turkey 's seizure of churches and land alarms armenians ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/world/europe/turkeys-seizure-of-churches-and-land-alarms-armenians.html ), 
   it 's not an assumption it is a probability based on the reality of human ancient kingdoms . 
  pretty sure there has n't been an ancient kingdom worth writing about that did n't conquer others .
