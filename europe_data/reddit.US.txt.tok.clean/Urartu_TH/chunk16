  lmao . 
  there was no war taking place in the vast majority of ottoman armenia ( western armenia ) . 
  perhaps it 's a strategy while they also slowly push for more language rights and autonomy . 
  i 'm sure they 're clever enough to experiment . 
  he 's referring to systematic/planned government annihilation , not merely civilian deaths during war . 
  eh ... you 're sleeping with the devil http://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/2464146.html http://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/business/2473336.html, 
  it can be ; turkish culture is filled with nationalism that 's treated rather casually , as if normal . 
  such nationalism helped `` justify '' the armenian , greek and assyrian genocides and may one day justify a kurdish one . 
   that means 2/3 of kurds voted for the ruling akp government that has made it very clear what its policy towards the pkk would be post-election islam is one hell of a drug . 
  you ca n't crush the pursuit of freedom and human rights . 
  relevant : [ azerbaijan in crisis as currency plummets ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/22/azerbaijan-currency-plummets-oil-price ) azerbaijan 's dictator is trying to keep his peoples ' minds off of human rights and their economy by claiming territory and starting war . 
  what do you find that 's not objectively reported ? 
  the article is about the news conference given by the defense ministers of greece and armenia where they spoke of turkish support for isis oil sales etc. 
  not much analysis even . 
  cut the crap . 
  armenialiberty.org is a part of the radio free liberty/radio europe news outlet that is run by the us government .

  they 're an active turkish terrorist organization that is currently operating in syria with sultan erdogan 's blessing . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grey_wolves_ ( organization )  according to authorities , 220 of its members carried out 694 [ 25 ] [ 26 ] murders of left-wing and liberal activists and intellectuals . 
  [ 18 ] attacks on university students were commonplace . 
  they killed hundreds of alevis in the mara\u015f massacre of 1978 [ 27 ] [ 28 ] and are alleged to have been behind the taksim square massacre of 1977 . 
  [ 19 ] [ 29 ] the masterminds behind the attempt on pope john paul ii 's life in 1981 by grey wolves member mehmet ali a\u011fca were not identified and the organization 's role remains unclear . 
  [ c ] due to these attacks the grey wolves have been described by scholars and journalists as a terrorist organization . 
  [ 8 ] [ 30 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] https://www.rt.com/news/323658-turkmen-commander-turkish-ultra/ http://yournewswire.com/turkmen-who-killed-russian-pilot-is-son-of-turkish-mayor/ their latest terrorist attack was the 2015 bangkok bombings . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_bangkok_bombing  a turkish man , adem karadag , was arrested by the thai police in connection with the bombing after fake turkish passports [ 46 ] and bomb-making materials were found in his apartment . 
  many of the turkmen are actually turkish citizens and members of the terrorist turkish organization the grey wolves . 
  the lay with al-nusra ; they are no better than al-nusra . 
  aligning will al-qaeda ( al-nusra ) does though . 
  shooting down a parachuting pilot just makes you a pathetic war criminal . 
  the terrorists that shot and killed a parachuting russian serviceman ? 
  rebels ? 
  do you mean ahrar-al-sham or al-nusra terrorists ? 
  source : turkish foreign ministry . 
  please update title . 
   though possibly with connections to al-nusra ( al-qaeda ) . 
  like how you mentioned that so non-chalantily, 
  sounds like you just mentioned a bunch without researching, 
   most of their attacks are against rebels who fight against isis such as ahrar-al sham , al-nusra ( al-qaeda branch ) and other terrorists ? 
  good !, 
  ... aka mikheil saakashvili , the war criminal currently awaiting trial in georgia . 
  why ? 
  forced to clamp down on corruption , or something like vote-rigging which enables the ruling party to stay in power ? 
  or to stop the nationalist , historical revisionist bullshit ? 
  i was being sarcastic . 
  i agree with everything you said . 
  unfortunately , most on / r/europe are too blind to see through the propaganda fog . 
  fyrom politicians are embarrassing themselves and ruining the reputation and face of their capital, 
  just as kosovo is a part of serbia ? 
  civilized world ? 
  wow that 's pretty disgusting, 
  you 're blaming the eu for the situation in ukraine ? 
  provocation likely from both sides . 
  the point is that the georgian regime of saakashvili attacked and killed villagers and russian peacekeepers which started the war . 
  abkhazia and south ossetia are n't georgian territory anyway ; unless you support the work of joseph stalin . 
   later when georgia is invaded by russia seriously ? 
  [ georgia 's started unjustified war an eu-sponsored report has concluded . 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8281990.stm ), 
  or more kurds ? 
  ( although this would n't change your statement ), 
   mhp as of recent years has become a lot less radical except when their youth wing vows to [ hunt down armenians in the streets of kars ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/anasayfa_mhp-youth-wing-head-slams-armenian-jazz-concert_391862.html ), 
  masters in history ? 
  may be interesting and rewarding but i hope you do n't have to pay for it . 
  lmao . 
  fuck off boy, 
  looks like some are exeter , college of london , cambridge , loe , manchester . 
  actually , it looks like a majority are ethnic english , scot etc. 
  can we stop using the term `` rebels ? '', 
  all current opposition/insurgent groups are jihadist , whether they be isis or the groups under the `` army of conquest '' umbrella -- al-nusra , ahrar al-sham etc. 
   whatever rebel group comes on top than have an iranian/russian military outpost next to my country . 
  how selfish and disgusting consider all rebel groups are now either jihadists ( isis ) or under a jihadist umbrella group ( army of conquest which includes al-nusra ) . 
   regime helicopters using jihadists ' lingo ? 
   religious fsa ** [ allied with al-qaeda ] ** fighting with american weapons . 
  ftfy . 
  truly revolting . 
  i assumed you were comparing france and britain to the us . 
  i 'm not sure what you meant by `` world power '' , but france and britain certainly are no more than regional powers today . 
   now they 're a world power , like france or britain . 
  lol what ? 
   armenians who are literally never supportive of israel have zero right to demand that we support you instead of our good friend the azeris . 
  we do n't want your support . 
  simply stay out of our way . 
  do n't stick your noses where you do n't belong . 
   i do n't support aipac . 
  i have no problem with them per se , and think your characterization of them is mentally ill , but they 're too liberal for my taste , and they reinforce israel 's role as an american client state , which i bitterly resent . 
  they are a terrorist organization , through and through . 
  they support the subjugation of the palestinian people , they work in favor of armenian holocaust denial and various bloody dictatorships , such as the one in azerbaijan . 
   what i can say is that virtually every exchange i have with armenians is acrimonious perhaps that has something to do with you ? 
  also , good luck supporting terrorist `` lobbying '' organizations that espouse hate speech via armenian holocaust denial , and keep kissing azeri dictatorship ass . 
  i do n't agree with it , but perhaps it 's israel 's decades-long armenian holocaust denial ? 
  or the terrorist lobbying group aipac 's work against armenian holocaust recognition in the usa ? 
  or perhaps israel selling advanced drones to azerbajjan which uses them on armenian villagers ? 
  [ armenian empire ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/maps_of_the_armenian_empire_of_tigranes.gif ) . 
   that was n't a coup , einstein . 
  the nazis were already in power in ' 34 . 
  potentially same situation here . 
  / u/brutallyhonestpos said `` staged . '', 
  it 's sad . 
  when i once pointed out how genetically similar armenians and turks are since most turks have some armenian lineage on an infamous turkish subreddit , i was called every sort of name imaginable . 
  [ are turks acculturated armenians ?
