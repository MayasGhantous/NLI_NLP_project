   also keep in mind that now isis is going to begin trying to attack turkey even more , not just the kurds but the turkish state . 
  this is going to escalate the turkish army 's role against them too . 
  there are reports of turkish special forces incursions into syria yesterday already . 
  this will also give turkey the excuse to attack the kurds in syria and iraq , thereby debilitating them enough to prevent an autonomous kurdish state in syria . 
  all to plan for turkey perhaps . 
  yes . 
  [ war against isis : pkk commander tasked with the defence of syrian kurds claims ` we will save kobani ' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/war-against-isis-pkk-commander-tasked-with-the-defence-of-syrian-kurds-claims-we-will-save-kobani-9854818.html ) [ pkk female fighters vs. isis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qwfpdbz6wy ) [ meet the pkk ` terrorists ' battling the islamic state on the frontlines of iraq ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/meet-the-pkk-terrorists-battling-the-islamic-state-on-the-frontlines-of-iraq ) [ how the p.k.k. , peshmerga , and a few odd westerners are fighting isis ] ( http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/02/fighting-isis-in-iraq ), 
   i avoided the points you made because they are fucking irrelevant to us bombing pkk ffs . 
  except , they 're not . 
  you requested approval to do so because of an islamist ( probably isis-linked ) who killed pro-kurdish activists inside north kurdistan , turkey . 
  this could 've all been prevented had your government not sponsored terror for years . 
  nice job of ignoring virtually every point i made . 
  also on top of all of this , your terrorist-sponsoring government has also been attacking the pyd kurds in iraq . 
  your government has tacitly approved the slaughter of kurdish civilians in syria and iraq by ( i ) not allowing kurds from turkey to provide assistance , ( ii ) allowing isis to sell stolen oil inside turkey through turkish agents , ( iii ) allowing isis fighters to cross the border and receive medical treatment and ( iv ) planning ( as far as we know ) false flag attacks inside syria . 
  stop pretending to be angels . 
  you ask for permission to bomb isis after pro-kurdish activists get killed and then you bomb the only people affectively fighting against isis ( yet again supporting isis ) . 
  take a look at this article from last year about the pkk everyone . 
  --  [ why the us should take pkk off the terror list ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/09/why-the-us-should-take-pkk-off-the-terror-listcommentary.html ), 
  hmm...pro-kurdish activists killed in suruc massacre leads to turkey bombing ... the kurds ?? 
  those saying that there wo n't be massive blowback inside of turkey soil for all of these shenanigans are delusional . 
  do n't forget the false flag terrorist attack the turkish government was deviously hatching months ago for syria . 
  we 've come full circle ? 
  or this is a farce ? 
  i agree , your government does a tremendous job at creating negativity toward it . 
  these posts are not necessary to achieve that . 
  please keep in mind that the victims were a ** pro-kurdish ** group organizing essentially a fund-raiser for those affected by the violence in kobane , syria . 
  the violence in kobane was caused by isis as turkey sat on the sidelines and even prevented kurds in turkey from assisting those in kobane . 
  edit : downvoted for posting nothing but facts . 
  okay . 
  yes . 
  all based on your silly `` expertise . '', 
  probably as much as americans feel a connection to england ? 
  you found one article about an armenian who stole a bicycle to buttress your claim about the overwhelming number of armenian pickpockets in your city ? 
  fool . 
   even worse then those from the caucasus you still do n't get it . 
  i would gladly accept a claim without proof if it were widespread . 
   belonging certain ethnicity takes a positive or negative role in your life . 
  it 's up to you to decide what to make of those implications and what course to take -- whether positive or negative . 
  furthermore , `` idiot '' is not exactly a curse word where i come from and is fitting here . 
  but they 're never accused of such things in europe , and again do n't have anything to do with this migrant issue . 
  you can take the word of this guy if you want . 
  perhaps that suits your objective anyway . 
   and armenians nearly every day . 
  wait ... what ?? 
  i doubt there are many pickpocketing armenians in your city , idiot . 
  also , the people in the photo are probably from the middle east or north africa , not the caucasus . 
  probably near zero edit : downvoted because ? 
  even russian muslims concur : [ former priest of russian orthodox church , russian muslim ali vyacheslav polosin , ideological inspirer of the russian muslims ' organization `` straight path '' ( russian : \u041f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u044c ) declared the population of ethnic russians who converted to islam to be approximately 10,000 . [ 1 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_muslims ) . 
  10k figure is a tiny -- and probably exaggerated -- portion of the ethnic russian population . 
  you 'll probably find more converts to islam in western europe , honestly . 
   plus afaik mainland turks outnumber turkish cypriots now . 
  i 'm sure that was the plan all along . 
  teenagers/twenty-somethings standing at a border post while posing zero imminent threat . 
  he 's the guy that massacred russian peacekeepers and foolishly started a war that forever lost him the breakaway territories of abkhazia and s. ossetia , along with a fugitive . 
  i 'm sure georgia will let you guys have him . 
  bp 's and azerbaijan 's [ baku-supsa pipeline ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baku%e2%80%93supsa_pipeline ), 
  i completely agree . 
  okay . 
  in these cases , what is more relevant are conclusions developed through scholarly work by historians and researchers than the often politically-driven -- potentially bribed -- whims of international organizations . 
   i also put the word genocide in quotations ( about the massacre of the armenians , because it also technically is not officially recognised by the un ... technically , due to turkish pressure the [ greek genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) is n't either . 
  i do n't think srebrenica should really be compared to these cases anyway though . 
  why are you using quotation marks around the word genocide after armenian ? 
  sometimes the perpetrator nation or it 's successor continues to use a genocide issue to incite hatred against the victim group and aggressively deny that the events even happened . 
  in such a scenario it 's extremely important for the international community to set an example that such behavior will not be tolerated . 
   you forget that the roman empire was multi-ethnic . 
  again you 're referencing things i 'm not talking about . 
  i 'm not talking about . 
  i 'm talking about the evolution of the ** eastern ** roman empire into the byzantine empire in the 7th century . 
   thing is , during the greek war of independence the rebels wanted to establish a roman state at the beginning . 
  they were greeks though , were n't they ? 
  that 's the point . 
  the byzantine leadership and people were also primarily greek . 
   the second language of the empire and that of the eastern half of the empire was greek . 
  it made sense therefore to use greek in official documents , when other non-greek speaking areas were lost . 
   but in all important respects , this was the empire of augustus , trajan , diocletian and constantine . 
  the people were as roman as the citizens or rome itself !, 
  their culture was definitively roman , with the same cultural activities ( like the hippodrome ) and same events as before . 
  you 're emphasizing the beginning of the eastern roman empire only . 
  the leaders you listed in fact lived far before 330ad except for constantine . 
  empires that last very long tend to evolve . 
  as i mentioned the official language was greek starting in 610ad . 
  i highly doubt that the average person on the street of smyrna or troy or constantinople spoke latin in 610ad . 
  are you telling me that the citizens of the byzantine empire in what is now greece and western turkey were not primarily ethnic greeks ? 
  the [ byzantine empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_empire ) as founded in 330ad . 
  it was also known as the eastern roman empire , but it 's important to use the term byzantine to distinguish it from the original roman empire . 
  the byzantines were culturally greek . 
  the official language was greek starting in 610ad and remained so until the tragic sacking of constantinople in 1453 . 
   ptsss ... our nukes are not ready yet . 
  do n't worry , once the rest of your provinces are also annexed , russia will `` loan '' you some by putting them in your major cities . 
   what next ? 
  will greece become neo-roman ?!, 
  there should be a disclaimer here . 
  the publication is an anti-russian site in the ukraine . 
  please provide a more credible and unbiased source . 
   we also have turkic culture . 
  though i guess you did n't include it because it is obvious . 
  well of course . 
   so our language is a mix of middle eastern and central asian , not just northeast asian . 
  yes , i guess northeast and central . 
   do n't think greek or armenian shaped our language a whole lot tbh not the language , but considering millions of turks have greek and armenian ancestry , the culture has plenty of influence from those two peoples .
