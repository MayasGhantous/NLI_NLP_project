  [ source # 1 ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-genocide-convention-commentaries-international/dp/0199570213 ) [ source # 2 ] ( http://www.anca.org/docs/dezayas-summary.pdf ) [ source # 3 ] ( http://www.armeniangenocidereparations.info/?page_id=229 )  they were under no legal obligation to give anything back unless they were forced to i do n't expect much to be given back willingly , although there are legally claims collectively . 
  furthermore , many armenian landowners in turkey who now live in the diaspora have their deeds in hand . 
   so armenia committed war crimes and war crime punishment is a possibility . 
  war crimes ? 
  during the genocide ? 
  what ??? 
  or are you referring to the sumgayit massacre , baku massacre , kirovabad massacre et al. 
   it is not nonsense , especially sense not all azeris are puppets of the azeri government , a refugee in sweden could go back to armenia if they wanted to do so , it would not be a big community , but just because they can not enter via a border crossing does not mean that they can not do it period . 
  please do tell me when the armenian government had demanded anything on the state level from turkey ? 
  i 'm not aware of this . 
  also , the refugees mentioned in the osce statements signed by armenia , include all refugees from the conflict . 
   by counting the province 's population that are in modern anatolia . 
  you basically just have to take out a few arab provinces and there you go . 
  pain in the ass but possible , i gave you the full data so you cant claim a biased source . 
  by using ottoman statistics which inflate muslim population . 
  ok , i think we 're done here . 
   considering the fact that you have been using rounding the entire time to your advantage , rounding up or down rather generously to suit your needs , say 2.4 not 2.5 , and even then 2.3 is a max , and 2 is the modern claims . 
  even if we go with 2 million and discard the 2.4 figure , you would need to add the kars , ardahan etc. 
  so the 2 + mil figure is not doing anyone a favor . 
  return of properties for armenians due to dispossession after the armenian genocide is codified in the un genocide convention as a restitutionary measure . 
  no such law exists for refugees of war , although i agree that both armenians from baku and azeris from yerevan should get their respective properties back . 
  but for armenia to make empty promises is nonsense considering the vile response they would get from baku . 
  again , i ca n't be so emotional . 
   they give it asa 15.5 million , which is not the 13 to 14 you claimed . 
  where are you getting 15.5 figure from ? 
   and the 2.5 no academic would ever claim . 
  i 've cited the sources . 
  you can do more research on your own . 
  also , keep in mind that these figure do not include armenians that lived in kars , ardahan and neighboring areas where they made up close to a majority of the population . 
  you would need to add them to the 1.9 - 2.4 million figure . 
  that 's because the war took place in karabakh and azerbaijan , not in armenia proper . 
  also , the refugees mentioned are those in azerbaijan that the government refuses to integrate into society . 
  i do n't think that 's the case with former azeris in armenia . 
  these are two different issues . 
  the karabakh/artsakh issue must be settled mutually . 
  armenia has signed [ various documents ] ( http://www.osce.org/mg/51152 ) that mention the armenian refugee and azerbaijan refugee issues . 
  they are not being ignored . 
   here is the data for the 1914 census . 
  while you can state that the christians are undercounted ( and that is something i agree with ) , overall , the population should be accurate to within half a million . 
  1914 population statistics for the ottoman empire was collected and published at memalik-i osmaniyyenin 1330 senesi nutus istatistiki . 
  you should n't even post this . 
  many of the sources i mentioned state 2 million , which is an underestimation . 
  2.5 million of 13-14 million is roughly 20 % , as i stated . 
   it is still half of what you originally claimed 1.8 million is half of what i claimed ? 
  are you delusional ? 
  i hope you at least realized that your emotional/exaggerated responses earlier were unfounded . 
   and the important matter is that they have not mentioned anything . 
  again , if they said , hey , we will try to compensate you , or wish we could or something , i would consider that acceptable . 
  i disagree , but i guess i 'm simply not as sentimental as you . 
  making empty offers is pointless . 
  here : _______________________________________________________________________ a [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_armenian_population ) cites various sources including many ranging from 1.9 - 2.4 million . 
  for example : `` in 1844 , the ottoman government recorded a total of 2.4 million armenians . 
  abdolonyme ubicini , a french historian and journalist , was one of the first to publish the 1844 figure by adding that he considers it an underestimation of the total ottoman armenian population . '', 
  `` fa'iz el-ghusein , the kaimakam of kharpout , wrote in his book , that according to the ottoman official statistics there were about 1.9 million armenian 's in the ottoman empire . 
  [ 30 ] '' `` 1912 , the armenian population in the six vilayets of the ottoman empire according to armenian patriarchate of constantinople was 1,018,000 . 
  toynbee settle on between 1.6 to 2.0 million and states that the real number is probably closer to 2 million for anatolia . 
  pushing the median slightly on the right . '', 
  `` another problem with the figures is that those numbers were drawn from a period of about 20 to 30 years , mostly from 1890 to 1915 . 
  german official figures representing the armenian population within the empire were about 1.9 million to 2 million . 
  [ 22 ] '' as you can tell there was a lot of controversy about such figures , and naturally they would be underestimated due to being based upon ottoman sources and statistics , or gathering efforts that were subject to ottoman review and approval . 
   also , the azeri claim is purely childish ... 
  so since the azeris deprived innocent civilians the armenians get a right to as well ? 
  seriously , that is not even close to the moral high ground , that is the moral low ground given the claims on turkey ... azerbaijan is shit too , but in this situation it should not matter , armenia should do the morally right thing . 
  but that 's not going to happen . 
  perhaps they could , if they knew that a few of those people would n't disrupt security for the karabakh republic as agents for aliyev who threatens war almost as fast and often as he pilfers his own country 's oil wealth . 
  ultimately the only solution to that situation is regime change and democracy in azerbaijan . 
  what i said is common knowledge and when i get i chance i 'll `` source some shit '' , but calm down with your language buddy . 
   find it massively hypocritical they wo n't allow right of return or property to azeris . 
  like seriously that was 25 years ago and was the same sort of shit , yet they are demanding it out of turkey ? 
  they should , but god damn hypocrites perhaps it 's because azerbaijan 's dictator aliyev says things like `` armenians of the world are our enemies . '', 
  it 's not as if prime former armenian real estate in downtown baku is about to be returned to armenians . 
  armenians dont have a right of return nor rights to their properties in azerbaijan . 
  also do n't compare the armenian genocide to azerbaijan 's war of aggression after the karabakh independence referendum . 
  14.5 million total is a stretch and 2.5 million armenians is close to accurate . 
  so around 20 % perhaps , maybe 25 % is too high . 
  they would 've been , of course , concentrated in the eastern half and closer to 33 % there . 
  in any case , they would 've made up a large portion of the population and probably more importantly they 've would possessed much more than 20 % of the wealth of the country since we know they were significantly wealthier per capita than any other ethnic group . 
  right of return and return of personal property/wealth , as you should know , is a central issue today . 
  brainwashed by grey wolves/mhp terrorist links . 
  also had their friends in the [ istanbul police ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/latest-news_former-police-chief-yilmazer-arrested-in-dink-murder-case_381998.html ) help them out . 
   uh 25 % is the percentage of all christian minorities in anatolia , of which the armenians were less than half . 
  and that is not factoring in higher birth rate and assimilation . 
  they would have been significant but i feel like you are pulling that number out of your ass if we 're going by heavily biased/anti-christian ottoman census sources , then perhaps , but not according to other figures . 
  25 % is conservative . 
  anti-armenian rhetoric is rampant amongst turkish elite and politicians , and there has n't been an armenian parliament rep since 1960 . 
  why ca n't life be so simple ? 
   it would be unfair to conclude that the absence of any armenian representatives in the past indicated a disenfranchisement of the armenian electorate . 
  they had n't had a member of parliament since 1960 . 
  also there 's issues over racism and armenian genocide denial . 
  this is a very small , but important step . 
  armenians have a far longer history in the territory today called turkey , than any other group and would 've likely made up roughly 25 % of the turkish population today if not for the genocide . 
  there 's also the issue of potentially millions of [ `` hidden armenians '' ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20150418-reporters-turkey-armenians-genocide-stolen-identity-video ) living in turkey today . 
  hmm ... smoke and mirrors ? 
  or is this the beginning of a movement towards genocide recognition and dealing with its consequences . 
  i have my doubts ... 
  just because he 's contrarian does n't mean he 's wrong . 
  is this still happening ? 
  i thought there were calls to cancel or boycott these games due to human rights abuses and corruption similar to qatar 2022 .
