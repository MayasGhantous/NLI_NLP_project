  they 're understanding that now . 
  like rabid dogs . 
   this is not `` fuck the armenians , 1915 best day of my life , '' that is pretty typical my people were slaughtered too comments . 
  she parrots the same whataboutism that is commonplace amongst the akp government . 
  literally every point that she made originates in ankara . 
  this type of veiled `` we suffered too , sorry your people accidentally died '' racist denialism is clear as day . 
   how can someone be `` aggressively in denial '' lol ? 
  in the sense that she was acting assertively to portray her hatred . 
  again , she could 've stayed silent . 
   she lives in belgium . 
  i do n't think she follows akp 's propaganda . 
  i 'm sure she has a telephone and an internet connection . 
  she also clearly has the attention of erdogan , as evidenced by his indirect assistance via his daughter . 
  she was n't merely indifferent , but aggressively in denial . 
  she is likely parroting the same racist anti-armenian nonsense in regards to the genocide that the turkish government spews . 
  even erdogan 's daughter has gotten involved on her behalf . 
  people like her need to be called out . 
  she 's not indifferent . 
   free speech is also a european value . 
  hate speech , though , is not . 
  i have n't heard her exact statement , but i 'm wary of similar individuals ' motivations . 
  i doubt she 's a genocide scholar of any sort . 
  she could 've stayed silent regarding her racist denial , but she chose to speak out and deny . 
  her party does n't allow for this , because such hatred is not a part of their platform . 
   not recognizing a genocide is not nationalism . 
  it is merely realism . 
  wait what ? 
  are you a denier as well ? 
  she should just apologize and recognize the armenian genocide to set an example for all european mps of turkish origin that this type of nationalistic hate is not tolerated in europe . 
  to me this is a european values issue . 
  in the past , they 've merely made stern `` warnings '' and temporarily recalled ambassadors . 
  but with the eu parliament not only restating recognition but also urging all member states to fully recognize the armenian genocide , turkey must realize that they 've all but lost this fight in europe . 
  therefore they may resort to more extreme measures . 
  not only are they worried about recent recognition of the genocide by bulgaria , austria , luxembourg , the vatican and statements by the german president , but they 've also sent a threatening message to the eu : turkey 's eu minister volkan bizkir has stated that [ for the first time turkey may refuse to accept a report from the eu if it mentions the armenian genocide resolution passed by the european parliament in april ] ( http://www.aa.com.tr/en/news/519837--turkey-objects-to-1915-pkk-points-in-eu-progress-report ) . 
  i 'm very curious as to how the eu will respond . 
  they surely ca n't back down after all this . 
  to be fair , georgia and russia to the north are both majority christian nations . 
  but yes you 're right , they do n't give a fuck ... been dealing with it for 1000 years . 
  yup . 
  that sub needs a major cleanup . 
  let 's hope they pass the 10 % threshold and get into parliament to end erdogan 's death grip . 
   and when it 's something with which he disagrees he gets emotional and defensive , when op is simply looking for a normal conversation my family moved to the states from the soviet union . 
  i know enough . 
  yes , but not the title of this submission . 
  and by the look of the comments , it 's obvious that many took this video as being generally indicative of conditions in the ussr throughout its history . 
  i understand that it 's relative , but it was the one of the worst periods in moscow . 
  therefore , the title is grossly misleading . 
  it would be much less misleading than this title . 
  a comparable title would be `` us grocery store sometime between 1880-1960 '' where the actual link was regarding the great depression . 
   it 's not propaganda , it really was like that in the soviet times . 
  the video itself may not be for propaganda purposes , but to post this video simply label it `` video of a ussr grocery store '' is a purposeful gross misrepresentation of the ussr . 
  this is where the propaganda is . 
   moscow was in a fairly good position because it was the capital of the ussr and those stores were usually getting enough products . 
  the point is that 1990 was one of the worst moments in the history of the ussr . 
  it would be akin to showing a picture of a food queue during the great depression in the us . 
  it should be noted in the title that this is 1990 . 
  not really the ussr anymore then ... just barely . 
  edit the title and resubmit . 
  show us a video from 1970 and quit the pathetic attempt at propaganda . 
  this sub is getting reallly low in quality posts . 
  it 's the same xenophobic nonsense , veiled as empathetic . 
  woah , much of that list seems to be plaguing my country at the moment . 
   - mind you , coup , not war - coup entails at least a mini-war in many instances where forces loyal to the leader will fight for interests -- monetary or otherwise -- that would be lost if their leader falls . 
  you can have a relatively bloodless coup in countries in eastern europe ( read : georgia , ukraine etc. ), 
  through the use of ngos and other subverise groups that work inside the country . 
  not sure you could do the same in africa . 
  probably only works with much more force . 
  a better comparison may be iraq and that was a catastrophe . 
  things to keep in mind , re funding : [ amnesty international received # 842,000 in 2011 from the uk department for international development as part of a four-year award commencing in 2008 and totaling # 3,149,000 . 
  and in 2009 , amnesty received $ 2.5 million ( approximately 1 % of its donations ) from governments . 
  the british government was the third largest donor ( $ 800,000 ) . 
  amnesty also received government funding in 2008 ( $ 1million ) , 2007 ( $ 1 million ) , and 2006 ( $ 2 million ) . 
  ] ( http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/breaking_its_own_rules_amnesty_s_gov_t_funding_and_researcher_bias ) also ... [ # 259,000 in 2007 from the european commission ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amnesty_international#funding ), 
  the hagia sophia cathedral should remain a museum ; no need to raise religious tensions by another islamic conversion . 
  there are plenty of mosques in istanbul . 
   irrevelant to us . 
  unfortunately it seems it 's not . 
  [ turkish fm reiterates karabakh-related precondition for normalization with armenia ] ( http://www.armenianow.com/karabakh/52130/armenia_turkey_davutoglu_karabakh_condition )  implying they have power to do such thing . 
  no , implying that they may have such power in the future ( probably projected from independent iraqi kurdistan ) . 
   i 'm sure a good turkish government would intervene if se turkey got de facto independent to make them de jure and de facto turkish again . 
  and i 'm sure you support the same in northern cyprus . 
   do n't see how karabakh matters to us . 
  unfortunately it seems it does . 
  [ turkish fm reiterates karabakh-related precondition for normalization with armenia ] ( http://www.armenianow.com/karabakh/52130/armenia_turkey_davutoglu_karabakh_condition ), 
   de jure means shit i wonder if your government feels the same way about karabakh and a future kurdish de-facto state in se turkey . 
  as an american and native english speaker , i can tell you that it sounds normal to me . 
  [ because isis is much closer ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/16/africa/isis-libya-north-africa/ ), 
  ukraine will join the eu with a mild/always simmering war in it 's east and an economy in shambles ? 
  you must be a putin bot . 
  edit : damn , i should be more clear when i 'm being sarcastic . 
  / u/trop _ commercial , i support your posting of these types of articles to shed light on various sides of these issues that are rarely discussed on / r/europe . 
   how was armenia ? 
  they were good , but not great : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyucr-sfenc&amp;t=20m19s, 
  lol at unian `` news '' . 
  nonsense ukrainian propaganda . 
  you 're talking out of your ass . 
  present some figures and/or events to back up your illegitimate bs . 
   iraq ? 
  because saddam shot at bush 's daddy . 
  it was a fuck up .
