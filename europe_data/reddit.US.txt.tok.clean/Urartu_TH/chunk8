  500,000 dead civilians , millions of displaced civilians , utterly destroyed infrastructure , a haven for terrorists , along with sectarian strife and violence that will last for decades . 
  never try to justify the iraq fiasco . 
  according to azerbaijani dictator , ilham aliyev , [ `` the shipyard in azerbaijan already produces ships '' ] ( https://twitter.com/shaunwalker7/status/555317842720329728/photo/1 ) . 
  ... watch out armenia . 
  i encourage everyone to follow aliyev 's twitter once in a while ... absolutely golden, 
  or any other subreddit not named / r/turkey, 
  this is / r/europe ... 
  the last time their parliament passed a resolution recognizing the armenian holocaust was in 2000 . 
  considering that the 1932 census had the country at 54 % christian and the 2012 census had it at 54 % muslim , i highly doubt their was a 5 % change in 12 years . 
  also the cia world factbook has the muslim population at 59 % . 
  you 're simply wrong , give it up . 
  iran , syria and lebanon are clear on armenian genocide recognition . 
  lebanon is [ 54 % muslim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_lebanon#religious_population_statistics ) . 
  syria 's parliament is the second parliament of a muslim majority country to call on turkey to recognize the armenian genocide . 
  one would hope . 
  perhaps turning a new tide . 
  you said assad was the first `` muslim to accept . '', 
  that simply not true ; many muslims and muslim leaders accept it as genocide . 
  i wonder if this has anything to do with the turkish government 's indirect support for isis ? 
  [ allowing isis to sell stolen oil in turkey ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/tr/business/2014/06/turkey-syria-isis-selling-smuggled-oil.html ) [ isis member claims cooperation with turkish army ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/isis-and-turkey-cooperate-destroy-kurds-former-isis-member-reveals-turkish-282920 ) [ allowing isis to use its borders for hiding and resupply ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/world/europe/despite-crackdown-path-to-join-isis-often-winds-through-porous-turkish-border.html ), 
  that 's a different issue . 
  we 're talking about the armenian holocaust where 1.5 million armenians , 500,000 greeks and 500,000 assyrians were slaughtered . 
  except that the specific site is in memory of the armenian genocide . 
  it is called a genocide memorial . 
  you could honor them in many other ways . 
  the fact remains that syrian leadership have joined lebanese and iranian leadership in recognizing the genocide . 
  all three are muslim majority nations . 
  oh yes . 
  tomorrow erdogan will come to the tsitsernakaberd genocide memorial to respect the dead . 
  he recognized by visiting and laying flowers at the memorial ; no denier would do that . 
  iranian president mohammad khatami visited the armenian genocide memorial in [ 2004 ] ( http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/11154/ ) .

  '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/witnesses_and_testimonies_of_the_armenian_genocide ), 
   nativism fallacy . 
  who 's generation lived there longer does not matter nor should it really in this case either you did n't get my point or are intentionally side stepping . 
  the point is that armenians were living on their ancestral lands . 
  because of this they were the best entrenched ethnic group and therefore owned some of the best territories and were by far the wealthiest people . 
   the front was moving , it was living and organic . 
  it in theory could change at any time . 
  they did not touch the armenians in palestine for the reason that they were not a risk , nor the greeks or armenians of izmir . 
  you are truly an imbecile . 
  fuck you . 
  armenian women and children were threatening and therefore deserved to be sent on death marches ? 
  you sick fuck ... go fuck yourself . 
  i assumed i was speaking to someone with some sense of logic , apparently not . 
  people were n't merely sent on death marches . 
  in many cases they were killed en masse . 
  [ look at every gallery in the link if you need to ] ( http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/photos_of_armenian_genocide.php ) . 
  armenians did n't `` revolt . '', 
  they demanded equal rights under the law . 
  this happened immediately preceding the hamidian massacres were 200,000 - 300,000 people were wiped off the face of the earth , you twisted animal . 
  you are equivocating by making a ridiculous argument that people who lived hundreds of kilometeres away from battle fields needed to be sent on death marches . 
  seriously fuck off you animal . 
  i 'm done . 
  sending women and children who lived hundreds of kilometers from the fighting on death marches is never justified nor militarily necessary . 
  the japanese were put into internment camps with food and fucking water . 
  do n't make ridiculous comparisons . 
  the japanese were never killed en masse . 
  more importantly the japanese were not indigenous to california as the armenians were to eastern asia minor ( the armenian highlands ) . 
   but there is a logic behind the action of moving them away from the front , even if the actual reasons and results were fucked up . 
  these cities were no where near `` the front '' , nor are women and children a threat . 
  there were armenian men fighting for the ottoman side also ( as tragic as that sounds , it 's true ) . 
  the primary motivating factors in the mass murders and death marches was the fact that armenians were christian and significantly wealthier than their muslim counterparts . 
  turkey 's economy was built significantly upon stolen armenian private land and wealth that continues to be occupied . 
  most of the cities i mentioned are in eastern turkey ( ottoman armenia back then ) . 
  those cities included sizeable armenian populations that were murdered or sent on death marches , even though they did not live near fighting . 
  this is an inescapable fact . 
  women and children that lived away from fighting were killed or sent on death marches . 
  how am i lying ? 
   except armenians were never deported from those cities in any significant amount ... what are you talking about ? 
  looks who 's lying after being caught writing nonsense .

  here 's a photo of armenians literally being sent on death marches from one of those [ cities ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/armenians_marched_by_turkish_soldiers,_1915.png ) , kharpert ( elazig ) . 
   because they try to shoe horn it in at the last second they as in the turks ? 
  that 's what happened this time . 
  [ caucusus campaign map ] ( http://members.shaw.ca/d_y_g/images7/7caucasus_campaign.jpg ) . 
  the idea that the mass murder and death marches of women and children were necessary for the war effort is disgusting . 
  do n't parrot that crap . 
   i 'm telling you if turks wanted to commit genocide they would have and not deport hundreds of thousands of people away from war zones . 
  there was no war taking place in most of hte regions were armenians lived . 
  the war in the northeast of anatolia with russia was merely used as an excuse to deal with the `` armenian question '' . 
  ten of thousands-hundreds of thousands were mass murdered ( we have photos and eye witness accounts ) and the rest of the hundreds of thousands were sent into the deserts . 
  stop saying `` deportations . '', 
  nothing in the archives defend that term . 
  what your ' e looking for is `` mass murders '' and `` death marches . '', 
  that is exactly what turkey said they 'd do until throwing nkr in as a precondition after the signing of of an agreement between the countries at the behest of the bloodthirsty dictatorship in azerbaijan . 
  now that turkey may have a russian gas pipeline flowing through its borders , their tone towards azerbaijan will hopefully change . 
  but ultimately the genocide of 1915-1923 is in fact unrelated to the nagorno karabakh independence war of the 90s . 
  tl ; dr -- europe and us always saw the events as genocide/holocaust but have been appeasing their `` ally '' turkey for decades by not using the term , but now are changing tune due to geopolitical changes . 
  armenians should be wary not to put too much stock in such wordplay changes ; does n't mean anything will change regarding restitution/justice . 
  i know . 
  just do n't allow sly denialists to twist logic and say that it wasnt intentional because it was `` deportation during war '' etc. 
  no fighting was taking place in most of the areas were mass murder and deportation took place . 
  do n't try logic with these people, 
  except that in many cases they were outright slaughtered in the cities in which they lived . 
  others were also of course sent on death marches into the deserts . 
  another important point to note is that anti-armenian and anti-christian sentiment was n't a new phenomenon them . 
  take a look at the hamidian massacres in 1894-96 were 200,000 armenians were killed . 
  oh come on . 
  you ca n't seriously be arguing that the karabakh issue keeps the aliyev family in power .
