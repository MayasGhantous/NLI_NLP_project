  the imperium of man is a hierarchical theocratic technocracy . 
  to suggest to do anything clever or new is to be a heretical deviant more often than not . 
  its basically a metaphor for the worst possible outcome of what humanity can become . 
  not even slightly . 
  the usa would like to have a word with you on that . 
  no i mean ; like our problems should tell you that human nature is complain even when things are good ; and to naturally gravitate towards trying to wreck your own shit . 
  this is because a person is a reasonably intelligent creature ; people are idiots and will tear their own throat out if someone tells them its for their own good . 
  the reality is important things like leaving the eu should not have been left up to a popular vote referendum . 
  american here ; speaking from a system that is equally buggered ; its very hard to want to vote when you think your vote does n't actually count . 
  in the case of us politics ; this is quite literal , especially in the case of presidential elections . 
  who is running for president and who stands on the committee of electorates is long decided before the election ever happens . 
  hell ; a lot of the people for the leave vote is seems thought their vote would n't count and voted `` in protest '' . 
  point of the matter is the politics of english speaking countries tends to be a bleak place with no hope of change or making a difference . 
  its fairly rare to find a politician who actually cares about his constituents . 
  try china , i am fairly sure china is still a little sore after whole `` opium wars '' . 
  heh ; american here to tell you 'd be surprised how angry people feel when england fucks you over . 
  fear mongering ? 
  last time i checked there is a 10 % down on their currency ; which probably will stabilize granted , but then there is the definite . 
  their credit rating is already being down graded , they have no guarantee of getting new trade deals before they leave the eu officially , they are definitely burning all the bridges that they had left with continental europe not to mention scotland . 
  their automotive industry has no reason to stay as their business was exporting to the mainland , and their banking industry is already in the process of downsizing to compensate for losses . 
  this is n't fear-mongering , this is the blatant reality ; they probably will be `` alright '' in the long run , but they wo n't be as successful as they were in the eu . 
  evidence time and again has shown that while a just governance ; democracy is not smart or efficient nor fair governance . 
  while it certainly is better governance overall than all that has come before ; its not great in any way either as it stands with regards to how we envision a democracy . 
  a country just voted for something that they knew before hand would ruin their currency , economy , global politics , trade partnerships , and diplomatic relationships because a slight majority of people decided they wanted to leave eu ( 17 mil ) even over those that did n't ( 16 mil ) . 
  say what you will about modern democracy ; its certainty a just system , but rarely an intelligent , never an efficient and not always a fair one . 
  i would never suggest we go back to the governments before it ; but we definitely need to look towards a new model of governance as its clear from the last century and nearly a quarter than the model we are running on is no longer sufficient for the size of government needed to manage our people 's needs fairly and justly . 
  i think you are confusing european jingositic attitudes with american ones . 
  sadly to say , but these days when that sort of shit starts up in the usa you get trump ; when it starts up in europe , as far as i understand people are generally wary of it . 
  i am not too familiar though with all this ; any europeans want to help me fill in my blind spots ? 
  i find this amusing for some reason . 
  who knows why . 
  nothing yet ? 
  its a soft coup , its slow . 
  right now all he 's doing is issuing orders that have dubious legality ( none of his orders have been reviewed by a court as far as i can tell ) . 
  mostly favors towards friends/business interests but also a reversal of a number of decisions under obama . 
  i am saying it will happen ; i did n't say it has happened . 
  the only thing i can clearly state is trump has surrounded himself with a cabinet of yes-men and cronies as well as appointed avowed white supremacists ( bannon ) to one of our more important offices for national defense . 
  i am not telling you it has happened yet . 
  i am warning you its going to happen soon . 
  sometime within this year , and likely quietly like many soft coups . 
  1 year was i wrong about this ? 
  the majority of the goverment ( 33 states , a small majority of both chambers of our congress , our executive branch and soon our judicary ) have all been assimilated by the far right wing . 
  more importantly on the political scale , the usa is much more right of the scale than other countries ; our `` leftists '' are right-wing moderates . 
  also early 20th century fascism oppressed media to limited information ; new age fascism focuses on disinformation to maintain control . 
  you know ca n't control the shear volume of free media , so instead you release enormous amounts of `` spam '' into the channels . 
  same goes for protests ; its all bread and circuses because the people do n't actually have the power to organize anything meaningful against the federal regime . 
  also ... what checks and balances ? 
  as i 've stated before ; the far-right wing party of the goverment now has control of all three branches . 
  a soft coup is where governmental entities seize extralegal * powers by sowing confusion and reducing the public 's awareness of its actions . 
  it has limitations in comparison to a hard coup ( where the military seizes power ) . 
  we 've experienced soft coups before such as mccarthy 's presidency taking advantage of the fear of communism to seize sufficient power to witch-hunt and prosecute communists ( even though there were no laws against being communist ) , he was ultimately stopped when the scotus was forced to respond if i recall correctly . 
  also again ; i am referring to the condition of my nation as a whole ; and trump is just the latest development . 
  the transition has been going on for decades now . 
  you all said that there was no way trump could become president , and he became president . 
  do n't ignore us again when we are warning you things are getting stirred up over here and that something bad is happening . 
  we know our history and this would not be the first time a president has seized illegal powers . 
  fascism by its definition requires both authoritarian organized * governance * and nationalistic * social * systems . 
  isis is neither an organized authoritarian goverment nor inherently nationalistic . 
  they are purely a ideological faction which use extreme violence to force compliance ; that is not authoritarianism , that is barbarism . 
  more specifically , he removed them off the watchlists of the cve ( department of the nsa ) and repackaged the cve to focus only on islamic extremists . 
  its nonetheless bad since the cve was focused on reducing domestic terror through community outreach . 
  i forgot to correct my information i am sorry ; but its still indicative of a move to reduce the focus on terror groups other than islamic extremists . 
  it clearly benefits everyone in those groups that are now excluded from the focus of intervention by the cve . 
  its a post on r/news and it was an article released by reuters, 
  fascism is an authoritarian and nationalistic system of political and social organization . 
  fascism as its basis is inherently nationalistic . 
   authoritarian english definition of authoritarian : favoring or enforcing strict obedience to authority , especially that of the government , at the expense of personal freedom . 
  english definition of fascism : an authoritarian *** and *** nationalistic *** right-wing *** system of government and social organization . 
  which one does the usa sound more like right now ? 
  the rise of increasingly nationalistic policy has been a thing in america for a very long time and predates trump . 
  trump is mentioned second in my post , with the nation being referred to first . 
  that was deliberate . 
  trump is the latest development in the increasingly nationalistic tendency of the usa as a whole . 
  alright i think i understand better , thank you !, 
  dude , trump is a wider symptom of a systemic problem in america that 's been going on since in the 1950s at the least and arguably has roots in the aftermath of our civil war . 
  how about instead of trying to shame me into silence , you go research it ? 
   nominal adjective 1 . 
  ( of a role or status ) existing in name only . 
  `` thailand retained nominal independence under japanese military occupation '' synonyms : in name only , titular , formal , official 2 . 
  ( of a price or amount of money ) very small ; far below the real value or cost . 
  `` some firms charge only a nominal fee for the service '' synonyms : token , symbolic not sure what the economic-speak definition is , but its definitely the wrong way to use it in the english definition . 
  edit : [ googled it ; you also used it wrong by its economic definition . 
  at least i think so , you tell me . 
  ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominal.asp ) assuming investopedia is a good source of knowledge ? 
  edit2 : he used the word right , you can stop downvoting . 
   nominal i am not entirely sure you are using that word right . 
  i am not referring to trump though . 
  i am referring the nation as a whole . 
  you ca n't say when seriously examining the usa that there are n't a lot of eerie parallels between the state of my nation now , and germany before the raise of the nazi 's for instance . 
  this was on the front-page of r/news this morning actually . 
  anyone that frequents that subreddit saw this . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-iduskbn15g5vo?utm_campaign=trueanthem:+trending+content&amp;utm_content=5892aff004d3012ade6d4b39 ) by dismantling the cve and re-purposing it , he effectively removed them from our watchlists without issuing that express order . 
  edit : at least * he 's removing an important tool from the goverment to counter domestic terrorism . 
  how long before he does this across the board though ? 
  this is another reason why i believe there has been a soft coup going on . 
  this has been going on for decades and now someone has finally come along to take advantage of the existing chaos ; only they then made it worse by tossing their own chaos into the mix . 
  1 year was i wrong about trump ? 
  if i was , i 'll apologize . 
  if i was n't , expect me to rub it in . 
  [ enjoy the read , please cross-reference with trump 's and the republican 's agenda ] ( https://ratical.org/ratville/cah/fasci14chars.html ),
