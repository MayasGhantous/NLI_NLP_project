  i am going to take the liberty of chiming in on this one . 
  personally this country of mine needs a wake-up call to the delusion that is `` american exceptionalism '' . 
  more specifically we can no longer police half our voters or most of our representatives , the only thing they care about is the bottom dollar or their own ego . 
  foreign sanctions would be a welcome course of action as the american people do n't really have much bargaining power given the state of our election processes . 
  usa has historically put usa first . 
  did n't enter either ww until it was attacked . 
  waged a large scale series of proxy wars during cold war due to conflicting ideologies with the ussr , the country 's the got swept up in it be damned , then there 's the nasty business of the middle east , what with oil and `` democracy/freedom '' . 
  generally speaking my country will always put itself first because that 's just the culture here . 
  it just happened to be a lot more pragmatic until about 30 years ago . 
  now its just as if the `` fuck you , got mine '' attitude is seeping into our international politics more and more , trump is just an extension of this . 
  the damages of not committing to the paris climate agreement for everyone else could number in the trillions of dollars from global disasters caused by rising temperatures . 
  there 's plenty of incentive for commitment to sanctions against the usa for that reason alone . 
  how can we be sure he was n't being sarcastic ? 
  oh for a second there i was colorblind and apparently `` shape confused '' , thought that flag was italy 's . 
  hungary has a reactor built by the soviets ? 
  * knock * knock * that sounds amazing ; can you toss some reforms our way ? 
  you see that as a flaw , i see it as a sign of a functioning democratic citizenry that actually gives a shit what 's done to them . 
  if there is anything the russians know how to build , its a reactor , just ask the ukraine . 
  seriously though ... why is n't it being built by domestic engineers out of curiosity ? 
   `` cheetolini '' i hope you do n't mind , but like many things now-american , i am stealing this . 
   let 's wait untill an actual statement . 
  and any justification there may be . 
  i hope it 's not insane this time . 
  wow . 
  okay . 
  i am sorry but i have to shut you down . 
  if trump says something he either means it , is leaning towards it or is projecting knowledge of what he knows someone else will do . 
  meaning that more than likely , he is not joking . 
  trump is a ( possibly senile ) narcissistic rich kid from the 50s . 
  he 's the definition of old school american ego , never having had an actually hard day in his life and to add to that he 's dumb as a sack of hammers . 
  optimism about trump is dangerous . 
  trump is the dark day scenario , he is not someone you can allow any optimism in or it will bite you in the ass . 
  please do not be optimistic with him , he really is that crazy . 
  mostly because there is a serious risk of losing our epa . 
  he 's threatening to dismantle or defund it entirely . 
  again . 
  we tried . 
  we outvoted the bastard . 
  i 've explained down in detail why we can not enact change within a system that from our founding as a nation has been * designed explicitly * to constrain the effectiveness of the popular vote and its only gone downhill from there . 
  so yeah there is someone else to legitmately blame ... our founders , our leader of every year until now who constructed the system we live in today . 
  frankly instead of taking jabs at the usa maybe you should go appreciate your actually functioning democracy . 
  here in the usa yes , we can vote , and yes we could make a change ... but the logistics are n't there . 
  here in the usa , the poor need to make a choice between food on their table and voting that day as they live pay check to pay check and most americans * are poor * , in case you did n't realize that . 
  most of us literally can not afford going out to vote even if we were n't apathetic to the whole situation . 
  so please , go to hell . 
  edit :  you did n't vote for trump , but how many racist uncles do you have who did ? 
  did you engage with them and try to get them to vote against him ? 
  or did you just leave them alone to be as racist as they want because you did n't want to upset the family peace ? 
  many of your friends probably did n't vote at all , or pissed away their vote on a third party candidate who had no chance of making a difference . 
  did you push them to vote for clinton ? 
  little note ; americans are touchy about politics , that is a good way to become the black sheep at any family reunions or friendly outtings . 
  there is no `` civil discourse '' anymore because of how nasty things are getting ; those that do n't get outright hostile to `` affronts to their beliefs '' are evasive of the whole topic . 
  to you it might seem a simple thing to ask ; to an american its basically asking them to risk losing a friend or family member . 
  its more 25 % , many of which are old or dying coming from an age in america where they were handed everything on a silver platter and keep trying to make that long gone way of life fit like a square peg into a round hole . 
  unfortunately that 25 % happens to make up 50 % of people that are n't apathetic about politics . 
  and why would the other 150 million americans care ? 
  establishment democrats forced their candidate through and just further proved that the establishment does not care about americans anymore than the republicans do for instance . 
  meanwhile our electoral system is so broken that despite having a whopping three million less votes than the popular voted candidate ( clinton ) he still won . 
  and then !, 
  on top of all this ? 
  we lost control of our senate and congress because 33 of our 50 states are so gerrymandered to shit in favor of the republicans that they can force a majority anytime they want . 
  which is only added upon by the insult there is now soon to be a right-leaning majority in our supreme court which means for up to the next 50 years left leaning legislation will be at risk of being struck down as `` unconstitutional '' . 
  our system is inefficient , broken and inherently incapable of producing any change . 
  why should anyone try wasting time they could spend taking care of their family , working at their jobs , or anything actually productive in this country ? 
  *** tl ; dr : sorry for the little rant but . . fuck man , we actually tried and nothing changed , so saying that is uncalled for man . 
  let 's be frank here , many americans are too . 
  breathe really quick . 
  that 's the environment you 're breathing in . 
  do you like breathing ? 
  yes ? 
  probably should care about it . 
  sorry if that sounds condescending but this is coming from a guy that is jealous of europeans not having to worry whether their president will send their environmental regulations back to 1970s levels of non-existence . 
  yep , not looking forward to that . 
  so what you 're saying is ... its okay to not want to live on this planet anymore ? 
  i am sure your country can ^ ^ ^ get into space . 
  well , at 1930-40 levels of c02 yes ... but we ( humans ) are past the point where we can avoid a 2c globe temperature change so at the current rate that might happen anyway without such a project to lower temperatures in the region . 
  count the number of countries in the world , and you still would have enough stars for the future american flag .

  i will have you know it tastes delicious . 
  no do n't do that . 
  * cough *  by some magical incidence he gets reelected 83 % support among republicans and given he 's who they voted for ... we 're probably going to have 8 years of trump is those ratings hold . 
  on another note ... mike pence is just as crazy as trump minus the toddler attitude , and could run for election after trump 's first or second term on his own platform . 
  see trump is n't really more than an embarrassment for us . 
  watch out for pence . 
  you could have 16 years of madness coming from the usa to look forward to here . 
   not to recognize a nation with a rigged electoral system and built on stolen land most of the world 's modern nation-states are fucked because of either or of these conditions . 
  on that note ... welcome to the american house of moderate thoughts , its a little empty i know but we sympathize with this sentiment ( also are aware we or rather i am no european , stuff it ) . 
   delusions of grandeur aside : it 's your future , not ours . 
  economic reason this affects you : the united states dollar is the reserve currency of the world ; this means other countries investments are very much tied up into the value of the usd . 
  if any of trump 's policies cause a significant market recession ; you will feel it . 
  recall the 2008 economic recession ; the immediate cause of which was usa housing lending , it had far reaching consequences that affects even those in europe . 
  geopolitical reason this affects you : trump has made numerous statements he wants to build bridges and warm the icy relationship between the united states and russia . 
  we are talking about trump here alongside mike pence ; they might actually consider dismantling certain bases in the missile defense system protecting europe from a nuclear attack from russia and no that is n't fantasy . 
  even if they do n't , assuming trump sticks to his stated positions , europe will not find a strong ally against russian aggression with the usa in the coming future . 
  domestic political reason this affects you : simply put , the tolerance of hateful views in the united states is a single to other alt right groups . 
  in some countries where these groups have a significant potential base to draw upon , we might see more `` trumps '' in the future , all around the world . 
  regardless of though of whether or not a country becomes increasingly alt right because of the results of our election making alt-right parties believe its the time to strike out into wider political discourse , assuming that trump keeps a hard position of all immigration , many europeans could find themselves deported back to their respective countries . 
  social reason this affects you : hatred spreads like poison in the veins of the world . 
  if things get as bad as a lot of us here in the united states are predicting , we are going to be seeing a new era of hatred of minorities grow within many of the right leaning citizens . 
  going back to that ; assuming alt-right party members begin winning elections in countries , you may begin seeing a similar transition .
