  if it was easier to move to europe i think most of our poor and `` middle class '' would leave without much convincing for it . 
  alright ; lets reasonably look at things here . 
  we ( conservatives anyway ) claim we are `` the greatest country in the world '' . 
  yet we do n't provide any of the basic needs that other good countries provide whom have a similar sized economy . 
  prove me wrong on this please without an opinion piece ? 
  as for people wanting to leave ? 
  i 've honestly got no good statistics aside from [ aggregated international statistics here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emigration_from_the_united_states ) as our goverment does not adequately track emigration or expatriating . 
  i know the opinions and feelings of my generation , and i know many of us do not want to remain in this country , that i can say for sure ; this country is not a good place to raise a family at all , and increased awareness of better prospects in europe or asian is going to drive some level of emigration from this country in the younger generation , this much i am sure of . 
   our car culture this is [ london ] ( http://handluggageonly.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/elizabeth-tower-big-ben-s.jpg ) at big ben . 
  this is [ new york ] ( http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/390161636_1280x720.jpg ) at times square . 
  both major cities with 8.5 million , huge differences in car traffic , urban density etc. 
  why ? 
  because new york ( especially manhattan ) had a limited amount of space and needed to increase urban density to allow for greater car traffic . 
  lets cover something you said though next . 
   property taxes can vary greatly by municipality , which in turn segregates the rich , poor , and middle class geographically . 
  because different races perform differently economically , this has the effect of appearing like a racial divide as well aside from being very clearly ... uncomfortably suggesting as though this is a natural thing to have such segregation in society ( it is n't ) . 
  i 'd like to quite frankly point out that if we truly are the `` greatest country in the world '' , perhaps we should make it so everyone actually has an equal footing to succeed ? 
  one thing for sure is regardless of the * cause * , the result is inherent racial inequality . 
  i never said that the inequality itself is intentional under the systems we have , i said maintaining that status quo and not helping these people is what is inherently a racial divide , and you 'd know this if you tried reading what i wrote . 
  tl ; dr : read the damn post . 
  yeah ; its honestly insane . 
  it happens in every city though , even major ones . 
  the only reason cities like new york have consistent infrastructure was because * they had to * , not because they wanted to . 
  pick a random city . 
  explore . 
  it wo n't take long to find this pattern . 
   the culture is very different in many ways , and things that are taken for granted simply do n't apply . 
  elaborate more ? 
   she were 100 % german , but it turned out she was n't from germany yeah `` german '' means your ancestors came from germany here and considering there has n't been a major immigration wave from germany in awhile , they will probably be 4th generation americans . 
  as an `` immigrant nation '' a lot of significance is placed on where you come from . 
  i feel this really just lends to a lot of the racism and segregation that goes on here honestly . 
  i mean , up until the 20th century , white on white racism was still a thing ; think about that for second ... its insane . 
   the whole way europe is seen was very unexpected , how did they see europe ( there are a lot of us , lots of regionally varying opinions ) . 
  edit : for downvoters ; a clarification  i mean , up until the 20th century , white on white racism was still a thing ; think about that for second ... its insane . 
  this is a statement of * fact * not a statement of * opinion * . 
  this is n't justifying racism , its pointing out we 've come a long way in 200 years . 
   the quality of universities would be better because there 's so much money in the system  i 'm appalled by the health care system even though i have relatively good insurance  i 'm frustrated with the lack of functioning public transportation ( la ) . 
  heh no ; when you create profit motives for education or healthcare or even transportation , companies will make things as cheap for * them * as possible while still offering * functional * but not necessarily great service . 
  in general its all pretty awful . 
  yeah during the 19th century we had major immigration from china , and in the 20th century from the philippines , as well as annexing hawaii ; so in certain areas and states we 've got ethnically asian majority minority areas . 
  i take it you were in hawaii ? 
  i am fairly sure they and the west coastal states are the only ones that do tsunami drills and yep , camping is free in many of our state parks . 
  yeah i am aware that urban planning is another major factor . 
   underdeveloped city what makes it feel under-developed ? 
   not as stupid elaborate on that ? 
   segregation a lot of it is from extreme economic polarization of the poor , the working class ( and the `` middle class '' who are really just working class with middle class degrees ) when compared to the true middle class ( business owners etc ) and upper class ( corporate executives , politicians etc ) . 
  when you live in a society that prides individual exceptionalism over collective welfare it definitely leads to a lot of segregation . 
  if it was easier to move to europe i think most of our poor and `` middle class '' would leave without much convincing for it . 
   how dead and crumbling a lot of inner cities were . 
  this is from our car culture . 
  the majority of places in any given city are designed purely to facilitate car traffic . 
  you 've seen the results personally of what happens when you do nothing but base your urban planning around cars , traffic , parking , and never anything about pedestrians aside from the most passing of thoughts . 
  heck most cities i 've seen do n't have consistent side walks , let alone cross walks for peds . 
  this should tell you how little budget the city gives for planning for foot traffic in regards to time or funding . 
   have you found a policy statement from her about it yet ? 
  here is your direct quote straight from [ hillary herself ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/politics/video/hillary-clinton-martin-omalley-discuss-encryption-democratic-debate-35866832 ) . 
  in essence she is advocating * some * kind of capacity for law enforcement to bypass private encryption without a warrant . 
   what legislation is that ? 
  wikipedia pages to get you started on your own research , its a lot to take in . 
  [ ttip ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transatlantic_trade_and_investment_partnership ) [ tisa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trade_in_services_agreement ) [ ttp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trans-pacific_partnership )  when does she do that ? 
  [ her campaign donation history over her career ] ( https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=n00000019&amp;cycle=career ) , one of the standouts being the time warner campaign contributions , high conflict of interest for someone overseeing the fcc , an executive regulatory agency ; although internet service and media are n't the only service the [ time warner company dabbles in ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/time_warner ) , its a fun read , enjoy your research trip . 
   people like you are a major part of why . 
  it 's thanks to you guys that trump stands a chance of winning . 
  please do n't equate me to a trumpkin because you do n't actually know what things go on or how things work over here . 
  you look like someone who ca n't seem to get it through your head that our ( usa ) goverment does not serve our interests anymore unless it benefits their agenda to get re-elected . 
   self-awareness , you should try it out some time . 
  how about instead of criticizing someone for their opinion ; you research their opinion , make sure they really are n't right , rather than going with what you * think * is right , in order to crucify them in your own court of public opinion . 
  that way you do n't embarrass yourself so badly next time . 
   senator palpatine , cause i think the over the top evil clown is full of hot air . 
  i think a lot of people miss this point . 
  trump is n't * that * scary once you take a step back and realize he has no support from the establishment and by the way , a big thing is `` but he 'll have the launch codes '' ... no he wo n't , that is n't how our launch code system works . 
  nuclear launch codes in the usa are a triple step , double key verification process . 
  the president ca n't just launch a nuclear weapon whenever he wants to it does n't work that way . 
  trump 's presidency would be the least effective in decades , but at least it would n't be basically 8 years of rights getting stripped away . 
  now the worst thing that is going to happen is he is going to put some crazy people into the supreme court . 
  which brings us to the issue of `` why does the president have the power to appoint someone to the supreme court , considering the supreme court is the executive branch 's boss ? 
  '' , that is some crazy nepotism potential right there . 
   i do n't know why you guys are rioting already . 
  because our media presents it in a package that normalizes it . 
  yeah , sounds about right . 
  the state of the usa seems to exist as nothing more than means of control and influence on a grand scale for its powerful elite . 
  less a country ; more an ingenious human machine . 
  yeah , the reason the media focuses so hard on trump is to gloss over the fact that clinton actually is * just as scary * . 
  she is going to be a major proponent of things that are going to cement a new status quo after 2016 that will make it even harder for median income americans , and really the globe ( at least if you use an apple product ) to have any privacy or own a small business ( she is likely going to lead the charge on the ttt deals regardless of what she is claiming right now , said deals are highly anti-competition , with favoring towards large corporations ) . 
   this is a joke question right ? 
  no , clinton fully intends to strip out data encryption for private citizens . 
  this would be done by mandating on manufacturing to implement a backdoor into their software , which means that american corporations products would be accessible remotely from anywhere by our surveillance state . 
  its some dystopian level crazy , but welcome to the new status quo coming after 2016 . 
   in the end we have the benefit of hindsight . 
  these were fairly brilliant guys , lets not pretend a part of it was trying to keep the power of the people out of the reach of the people , under the guise of making things fair . 
  actually , data is still encrypted , and its still illegal to force device manufacturers to implement a backdoor into their encryption . 
  hillary wants to change this , and since apple and microsoft ( and google ) have a global share of the market ... needless to say its a big deal . 
  basically instead of having to spend days or weeks getting into your device that they physically need to have access to , a backdoor would allow them to remote access any date on your phone at any time , this is a huge difference obviously ; this means you could actually be monitored at any time without a warrant . 
   why are they ignored by the mainstream media and the general population ? 
  fear . 
  in this particular election is say `` a vote for johnson is a vote for hillary '' or `` a vote for stein is a vote for trump '' . 
  american politics have become built around fear you 'll be responsible for losing the election to someone that does n't support your views at all . 
  so no one gets to make their real choice . 
   hillary is the best of a bad bunch . 
  when the best of the bad bunch wants to strip out data encryption ( make it illegal to have any ) without a back door for private citizens , and pass legislation that will make the global market anti-competetion ; favoring large corporations .
