  shows how much i know . 
  it makes me happy that the tokyo one has an aztec pyramid replica , though . 
  to be fair , even the disney here seems pretty old and outdated to me . 
  a lot of the rides and animatronics are from the 70s or 80s , and it shows . 
  spaceship earth , the ride inside of the iconic [ epcot globe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/spaceship_earth_2.jpg/250px-spaceship_earth_2.jpg ) is the slowest ride there and it still scared the shit out of me when it stopped mid-ride for seemingly no reason . 
  you could hear the rusty cranks from the bottom of your cart , and i kept imagining the breaks failing . 
  also , tomorrowland is supposed to look like the `` future , '' and it instead looks like a tacky 1970s vision of 2010 . 
  some of the rides are updated ( like [ stitch 's great escape ] ( https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/stitchs-great-escape/ ) ) , but not nearly enough imo . 
  epcot norway is building a frozen ride ( even though i think that movie was supposed to be set in denmark ) , but to that i say `` meh . '', 
  edit : added a sentence, 
  i do n't , but we tend to run under the assumption that every castle is probably haunted i think , lol . 
  especially the bran castle in romania , although haunted with what i 'm not entirely sure . 
  do dead vampires turn into ghosts ? 
  the map made me think it was some sort of ride/replica . 
  i take back the `` haunted castle looking '' comment . 
  yeah , lack of roller coasters is a real drawback . 
  i found magic kingdom pretty boring last time i went , but going to the harry potter section of universal more than made up for it . 
  [ alton towers ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-egbk15huwr4/u-tkkxqh53i/aaaaaaaaeom/ehtmmbspgea/s1600/21b7cb244a2f6099a98ab6e08bf01af3.png ) looks amazing . 
  what 's the haunted castle looking thing towards the center ? 
  haha , we have a u.k. section in epcot and i got pretty drunk at the pub there . 
  they imported beer from each country so i got to try a lot ( except in italy , where there was more prosecco ) . 
  [ main street ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a2/87/57/a287575d65e4aa0e03d272f4bfed25ef.jpg ) looks so pretty though, 
  we have several different parks , magic kingdom , epcot ( my favorite ) , etc. . . but it seems like the paris one is basically the same as magic kingdom in style ? 
  you do this too ? 
  i love going on google earth , zooming into the pacific ocean , and learning about a tiny island i never heard of before ; even in the cases that no one lives on it , there 's still pictures and info . 
  you should edit your op to say that . 
  i read your whole post thinking he was from the us , and it was weird . 
  i forgot how much i love this language . 
  i need to go brush up on it now . 
  it must be the same for italian , then . 
  i looked it up just to be sure ( have n't spoken it in a while ) , and it was giving me the translation `` fratello '' for sibling . 
  so in other words , you have a word to refer to a specific sibling ( brother or sister ) , but not a general term to denote a sibling relationship without inferring gender ? 
  edit : that must be it , i just realized i do n't know a term for sibling in italian either . 
  i make my own , it 's easy !, 
  but yea i have no idea what they put on pizza . 
  i 'm from ny though so at least it tastes good, 
  you mean mozzarella ? 
  his opinions seem to depend on which day of the week it is, 
  low turnout for midterms is actually a feature , since those who tend to vote in midterms happen to be more educated on the issues, 
  haha , that 's kind of funny because one of the dumber french stereotypes is that french people only eat cheese ( and maybe also baguettes if they 're feeling generous ) . 
  it 's not just europe , i see that in a lot of countries . 
  for instance , the stereotypes about the french here are not exactly flattering ( although anyone with a brain knows those stereotypes are stupid ) . 
  no offense , but you do see how hypocritical that is coming from you , right ? 
  there 's a restaurant in nyc that recently started serving raclette , and i ca n't wait to try it . 
  the cheese addict in me is singing . 
  does fap mean something different in the netherlands ? 
  the ones i bought in the dr had paintbrushes in it, 
  shhhshhh you 're going to trigger someone 's treason bells, 
  `` i 'm disgusted by america right now '' as if we all , or even a majority of us , supported this . 
  then you ridicule the ones of us who are protesting . 
  should i judge you on your le pen , monsieur ? 
  i sure hope she does n't win . 
  i do n't know , why do n't they ? 
  the south and the north here have different ideals , and the south would be ruled by the north 's decisions forever without it . 
  i do n't like it , i 'm from ny and i think the majority is the majority no matter where they are from , but it 's still a fact that without it texas will constantly bitch about their bible . 
  lol , get real . 
  sigh . 
  all of this hate and generalization you are doing is the exact same that trump supporters are doing . 
  the majority of us voted for clinton . 
  and those `` brown/black/all minorities/gay / people '' are americans , too . 
  for the record though , i voted for hillary , as did my state . 
  are you disgusted by those of us as well ? 
  because then texas cries that new york and california make all the decisions for them . 
  the first night of the stonewall riots included a fair bit of violence and destruction , and it 's now remembered in history as the kickstart to the gay rights movement in the us . 
  i think that number is way inflated , however , no elector has ever changed the actual outcome of an election with their change in vote . 
  and yet trump wants to stock up his cabinet with those crazy creationists like palin and carson , and his own vp wanted to open gay conversion camps . 
  it 's much worse than bush , imo . 
  even mexico . 
  on the way home , their agents had to remind us to keep our shoes * on . 
  * i thought it was pretty funny , actually . 
  how frustrated the airport workers must get , like `` why do americans want to walk on this disgusting floor barefoot all the time ? 
  i mean , what the fuck ? '', 
  i purposely say it that way to piss off people from arkansas, 
  we like you too , but we will never be able to pronounce your last name . 
  it looks like someone punched that baby in the face with the bottom of a stapler . 
  lmao , okay thanks, 
  i 've actually never watched something with this concept before , i like it, 
  i was joking !, 
  ( although her image did show up prior to an image of the actual island ) . 
  always love learning new things , though , 
  it 's nice that they followed instructions, 
   - saaranpaskantamasaari ( island shat by sarah ) i tried to look this up , because i was curious to see what inspired that . 
  [ why does this girl keep appearing in the results ? 
  what has she done to you ? 
  ] ( http://static-sls.smf.aws.sanomacloud.net/menaiset.fi/s3fs-public/styles/large_main_image/public/main_media/1418215302_original_b8833897z.1_20141210144140_000gdu7c4p9.10.iptcstrip.jpg?itok=l6fs_36c ), 
  always reminds me of [ this ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/scandanaviaandtheworld/images/c/c4/finland.png/revision/latest?cb=20120812083244 ) from the scandinavia and the world comics, 
  i believe it 's banned here too . 
  do you know why ? 
  how 's the ne like europe ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  i hear it 's lovely this time of year ... 
  judging by the rest of his comments , he bases all his knowledge off of stereotypes and no one can convince him otherwise so do n't even bother lol, 
  jennifer aniston is also mixed with english , scottish , and irish . 
  bjork is also mixed with irish and possibly inuit . 
  i do n't understand how you would n't have a morbid curiosity but i get it ; i 've lived near nyc my whole life and i 've never gone to the statue of liberty . 
  until two days ago it did n't even occur to me that anyone would change them , so i have no idea the reason . 
  probably because our tv companies have basically a monopoly over their region , and why fix something when customers have no choice anyway . 
  from my understanding it is because of the catacombs ; is that true ? 
  also , off topic , but is it typical for parisians to have toured the catacombs at one point , or is it just something that nobody really thinks about ? 
  interesting , that explains why montparnasse tower looks so out of place,
