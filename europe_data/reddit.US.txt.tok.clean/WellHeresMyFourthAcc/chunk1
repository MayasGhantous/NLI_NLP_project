it 's not exactly a feature of common ( british or american ) english but ( at least in the united states ) used as an example of black vernacular english . 
  generally , it 's treated as improper grammar . 
  around the same here and sometimes it 's only 3-5 mbps because comcast is evil like that . 
  it also depends on the current executive branch 's geopolitical strategy . 
  i doubt obama 's admin would use this method , especially in light of libya , egypt , etc. 
  if his geopolitical strategy involved such rebellions , he would 've recognized it as a failure by now . 
  given ukraine 's internal splits , i do not find american involvement a worthwhile hypothesis . 
  i 've played it a lot ( ca n't sing ) but that 's just unpatriotic british musicality . 
  true . 
  but i still think the us could 've done much better . 
  it annoys me that we put very solemn , very passionate lyrics about defending a fort from the british on top of a british song about merrymaking ( `` ode to anacreon '' ) . 
  also some of the other stanzas have disturbing lyrics ( `` and conquer we must/for our cause it is just '' - manifest destiny much ? ) . 
  the only * all-american * ( music and lyrics ) alternative i like is `` hail , columbia ! '', 
  but that 's currently the joe biden theme song . 
  plus the alternative regional identity ( feeling like a `` citizen of the british isles '' or something else that would put ireland with the uk ) probably does n't appeal very much to the irish public after what 's happened over the past few centuries . 
  historically speaking , i 'd say ireland 's just been more connected to mainland europe ( religiously , culturally ) and has gained reasons to distrust its immediate neighbors and look to the continent . 
  only two countries have more : the united states and japan . 
  but the number of roller coasters in these two countries ( 624 and 240 , respectively ) is so high that they 're the only two who have more roller coasters than the g7 average . 
  the words `` italy '' and `` italian '' are on the packaging four times . 
  so that explains the 113 . 
  it 's his night job . 
  he 's got to let the stress out somehow . 
  yep . 
  it was kind of a continuation of the four new world wars before it . 
  and i think the european battle over the new world continued until at least the late 1800s , with the french-mexican war and the possibility of british/french intervention during our civil war . 
  and in the end america 's probably closer to europe than any other non-european country outside the commonwealth . 
  dutch and spanish declared on britain and put them in a real bad spot . 
  * and * other countries declared war on britain . 
  not really . 
  the sino-soviet border conflict , etc. , demonstrate otherwise . 
  my mistake . 
  and a tradition . 
  btw fox is actually the most watched news network in the us ; do n't dismiss it as a fringe source because it does reflect the thinking of 40 million americans at the very least . 
  we = us , specifically us media . 
   not any olympics officials neither the noc nor the ioc keep official counts , iirc . 
   but even then it would just show that the usa tried everyone else 's system and then went back to their system for consistency 's sake . 
  depends on how 2004 and earlier were tallied . 
   i do n't think the usa , even with its nationcentric media , has anything to prove in olympic games . 
  well , as long as our media is amerocentric and jingoistic , it 's likely that they do stuff like this on purpose . 
  we counted by gold only in 2008 and switched in the middle when china took the lead . 
  i think the switch ( at least ) was motivated by a creative accounting . 
  / r/olympics has debated the system for a while and whether countries should even be ranked by medals . 
  did n't the ussr become heavily russo-centric , however , by the late ' 30 's ? 
  i know they set up the ssrs to `` divide and conquer '' ethnic minorities in many cases , so i 'm skeptical of the claim that they genuinely promoted local ethic and linguistic autonomy . 
  ... and the british dark humor . 
  / r/basicincome is worth checking out, 
  i 'm not sure if their current economic system ( based on cheap labor ) is sustainable , though . 
   and who will produce the cheap crap then ? 
  india ? 
  some other developing country ? 
  there 's a pretty big line . 
  a similar thing happened with japan . 
  in the 1980s , if you read `` made in japan , '' you 'd think `` shoddy quality . '', 
  now japanese products are considered high-quality . 
  i 'm wondering if something similar will happen with china in the next few decades . 
  ... and that 's the power of german engineering !, 
  yep . 
  even across the atlantic , just calling something `` german '' gets it to sell . 
  it 's like a stronger version of japan 's image - or the opposite of china 's . 
  but interestingly enough , almost everyone agrees that germany is the most trustworthy . 
  it 's the one good category every country 's conceding . 
  to be fair , we were pretty close to a military base and i 'm not sure if it was being carried by a truck . 
  there was a convoy of 2-3 small trucks and then a bunch of tanks either on the side of the road or carried by the trucks . 
  it was a few years ago , but it came to mind in this discussion . 
  i remember seeing a tank just driving along the interstate once as well . 
  not a cause for alarm - these howitzers would probably be transported without protests as well . 
  it 's a joke challenging germans to take it well . 
  the european total domination ( or `` scramble for africa '' ) , however , did n't take off until the late 19th century , becoming formalized in 1884/5 at berlin . 
  true , but by all means continue with your expansion eastward . 
  and the european union is collectively wealthier than any country . 
  it goes beyond that . 
  if you asked people if they felt like a `` member of the global human community '' or like an `` european , '' well some likely will not have that consciousness . 
  it 's like how people did n't feel `` italian '' or `` german '' a few centuries prior to unification , and how many opponents of ideologies like pan-arabism feel `` syrian '' or `` egyptian '' rather than `` arabian . '', 
  * sigh * again ? 
  that 's like the fourth time in a century . 
  get your shit together , europe . 
  i have a mental tic where `` i am boxxy , you see '' goes off in my head every time i see or hear the word `` trolling . '', 
  the world described above is one of my worst nightmares . 
  darwin himself was so religious that the majority of the * beagle * crew made fun of him for it . 
  the part where it gets tricky is where you figure out who decides which cultures are worth protection . 
  basically official . 
  context : ** japanese population ( entirety ) ** : 127 million ** population of the taiheyo belt , the megalopolis that tokyo 's a part of ** : 83 million ** german population ( largest of any eu country ) ** : 81.3 million ** californian population ( largest of any us state ) ** : 38.8 million ** polish population ( closest of any eu country ) ** : 38.5 million ###### ( tokyo fits in right here ) ** combined population of london , paris and rhine-ruhr metropolitan areas ( largest three in the eu ) ** : 37.3 million ** canadian population ( closest of any non-eu western country ) ** : 35.16 million ** combined population of new york and london metropolitan areas ( largest two in the west ) ** : 34.1 million ** combined population of new york and los angeles metropolitan areas ( largest two in any single western country ) ** : 33.5 million ** japanese population ( over-65 ) ** : 31.2 million ** london population ( largest of any eu metropolitan area ) ** : 13.4 million ## if tokyo were a country , it would rank # 36 in the world by population size , fitting in right between sudan and iraq . 
  yeah , the existence and dominance of the aau are huge assets when it comes to university-backed research here . 
  that 's the case for a lot of fields here as well . 
  physics especially seems to be getting screwed over pretty hard since all the research funding for science is mostly just research funding for technology and not theoretical research that wo n't have huge impacts until a few decades down the road . 
  the us does n't have infinite money either , and they do subsidize education pretty heavily , even for families that can afford it or opted for more expensive options . 
  i 'm not familiar with higher education outside india , the us , and the uk . 
  how do things typically work in german universities in your field ? 
  those countries do n't `` snatch up '' researchers as much as they just provide better research opportunities that are n't available in their home countries . 
  instead of creating an incentive against going abroad for research , the countries affected by this brain drain need to focus on having better research opportunities at home . 
  take india , for example - the lauded iit system is often compared to mit . 
  google `` iit '' and `` mit '' in the news filter - for iit , you notice that there 's a huge focus on getting high salaries after graduation ; for mit , the top entries will almost always be research . 
  even middle-tier universities ( state flagships and below ) in the us emphasize research and have professors that frequently take leaves of absence to turn their research into companies . 
  from my experience , there 's just a different attitude toward research between career-focused indian universities and research-driven american universities . 
  the perceived role of the university is different , and it leads to different results . 
   go home yankee you are not welcome here . 
  you should 've told us that in 1944 . 
  after reading the comments : / r/yurop is thataway --------- , 
  hey , you 're stealing * our * line of rhetoric . 
  go back to your cave , troll !,
