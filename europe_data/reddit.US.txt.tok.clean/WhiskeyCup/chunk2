  germany : and automotive libertarian 's wet dream . 
   i mean , aside from conchita , it 's one of the continent 's most conservative countries . 
  all that means to me is that russia is even more pants-on-head crazy than previously thought . 
  looks like sweden would get a lot of new roommates . 
  i always thought that the commission was the executive of the eu . 
  sure it 's the sole body that can introduce new legislation and that 's highly unusual in governments , but that does n't mean the parliament is the `` upper house '' . 
  if any eu body is the `` upper house '' it would be [ council of the european union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_the_european_union ) ( aka council of ministers ) . 
  also , the senate can introduce bills just like the house can . 
  but ... the senate is just one part of congress . 
  the house of representatives is the other part . 
  and the number of seats each state has in the house is proportional to the state 's population , just like the european parliament . 
  how come only the senate is listed ? 
  it 's early here . 
  i first read it as `` rammstein easter eggs '' and i thought / r/europe had taken a crazy turn . 
  why is north america and new zealand all fucked up ? 
  [ no , but these photos have ] ( http://www.eatliver.com/russian-dating/#vrxb66fwav5doysz.01 ), 
  and suddenly cameron is pro-federalism . 
  wait . 
  `` cocks tastes good '' is `` 12 months '' in estonian ? 
  [ umm ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8wita5-06p4/ueupxxnbosi/aaaaaaaacsc/nibkx3kjduk/s1600/jake-gyllenhaal-shaking-head.gif ), 
  what . 
  we said we 'd stop listening to merkel . 
  did n't say anything about other government members !, 
  i know what you mean , but the main reason why people react differently is because one of those people affects the lives of others and the other is dead . 
  it just seems like a backwards strategy to me . 
  cameron 's , i mean . 
  i get that , but when you 're in a coalition you got ta remember your party does n't have a majority in parliament and therefore not a majority of support from voters . 
  i 'm saying he probably forgot that key detail . 
  like , ~ 60 % of british voters voted for someone other than tory . 
  you 'd think he 'd be more centrist to keep or even gain more votes than alienate them like he has . 
  i guess cameron forgot that his government depended on another party with a different fan base ... woops . 
  their mooze . 
  i 've noticed a trend : it seems the top destination spots are countries everyone generally rips on or looks down on . 
  not all , but generally . 
  some serious love-hate going on , eh ? 
  you 're correct , the senate was meant to be the `` voice of the states '' while the house was meant to be the `` voice of the people '' when our constitution was first written , much like how the european parliament is the `` voice of the people '' and the council of the eu is the `` voice of the states '' . 
  that 's fine , in my opinon , and it is somewhat fair . 
  but after the [ 17th amendment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seventeenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) , senators are now voted popularly and this is undemocratic and just plain schizophrenic . 
  instead of a congress with representatives of the state governments and people coming together to decide federal law , we have basically two bodies elected by the people , with radically different proportion in representation , and on completely different election cycles . 
  even if you disagree with the assessment that it is undemocratic , you have to at least agree that it is a formula to a dysfuntional legislature . 
  not saying if we did things differently there would be sudden harmony , but it is very odd and i think there is a better way . 
  edit : forgot to mention that before the 17th , senators were elected by state legislatures . 
  people felt that senators were bought and sold , bribing state legislators to be elected to this position . 
  and it should be noted that the usa was more `` confederationalistic '' ( i do n't know if that 's a real word ) at the time of its conception , meaning the states had far more autonomy . 
  but not it 's evolved into an institution that we can all agree is more like dictionary definition of a federation , which is a * single * state with many self - governing entities within and a central government holding the thing together . 
  ever since the 30s and the new deal , this has made the federal government more important in the everyday lives of americans . 
  it should also be noted that several other federations do n't have an upper house that is the `` states ' voice '' . 
  take the canadian senate which is like the british house of lords . 
  or does represent the states but do n't have nearly as much power as the lower house , like the german federal council , while it does help shape german federal law , it does n't have equal power like the us senate does to the house . 
  wow , this turned out to be a lot longer than i thought when i started this . 
  * you get out * just kidding . 
  i think thomas jefferson wanted the united states to be like , a union of a bajillion small communes rather than 13 states . 
  just a fun fact . 
  no , but i just want to see them try . 
  i suddenly want to see what the olympics in best korea would look like . 
  i think every american i 've met who 's taken at least one german language course has seen * lola rennt * . 
  i like tom tykwer a lot . 
  i have n't followed this debate very closely , but i have to say , just from the half dozen or so short interviews with alex salmond , i like the dude . 
  yeah , i get you . 
  thanks !, 
  i just took the title from the article title , but i guess i could have mentioned that it was slightly misleading . 
  three times a charm ( ? ), 
  i do n't know who downvoted you since you 're saying more or less what everyone else has been saying in this thread . 
  awesome , thanks . 
  ignorant american here , what 's a `` private members bill '' ? 
  i guess ours are too . 
  they just lack an evil accent . 
  as an american i actually imagined a bunch of kids who were growing up in republican homes trying to square what their parents / whoever is telling them with what every other source is telling them . 
  you know . 
  cause every * true american knows * that europeans are sex craved communists who do n't shave . 
  edit : a letter, 
   why is the uk a market economy ? 
  this is strangely specific . 
  yeah , i 'd say france and germany are on the same level as the uk . 
  as soon as i saw that chart i began to wonder what the odds were that this is a british organization . 
  what is this graph measuring ? 
  i see years at the bottom and % at the side , but % of what ? 
  awesome , til . 
  seriously you 're awesome . 
  thanks nonetheless , the little you gave was more than i took from my very shallow online research . 
  i 'll look more !, 
  i wikipedia 'd ` common law ' and ` civil law ' and i 'm a little confused on what makes it different ( probably because of my limited experience with the idea , i just thought there was one way of doing laws ) . 
  could you explain it like i 'm five ? 
  i 'm aware , but they still kinda ` won ' by forming a government . 
  and successfully subduing their junior coalition partnet . 
  that 's kinda winning . 
  what makes you so certain that the conservatives wo n't win a reelection ? 
  as an outsider looking in it looks like they might win again . 
  can you give an insider 's perspective ? 
  pink countries : good job i think this is the best and most appropriate response . 
  blue countries : whaaaaaat if you 're going to legalize it at least regulate it . 
  green countries : hmmm not sure how i feel about this ... i hope with regulation that the girls are at least kept * safe * . 
   however , such optimism proved unfounded with the latest arson attack leaving members of the local goat committee dismayed . 
  best part of the article . 
  i understand how the ftt would work , but i 'm not very clear on the arguments for / against it . 
  yeah those languages are tonal , so like * ma * has five different meanings ( so i 'm told ) depending how you say the vowel . 
  that and the script would probably be the biggest barrier to learning it . 
  the closest thing to a description of english i 've heard was from mongolian speakers , they say it sounds like `` deedum deedum deedum dee '' . 
  that kinda makes sense how they 'd perceive that since the stress of words in mongolian are almost always on the front syllable , whereas in enlgish , it varies both on the number of syllables in the word , but what kind of word it is ( see * photographic * and * photography * ) . 
  also explains why the stress is always being fucked up when they speak english .
