  hmm , that makes sense . 
  yeah i get that . 
  but to meant like , japanese sounds very clipped and exact while russian sounds like it 's slipping and sliding and mongolian sounds like it 's grunting and coughing . 
  what kind of personality does english have or what does it sound like it 's doing when spoken ? 
  i always wanted to know how english sounds to nonspeakers but of course it 's hard to get people to talk about it because they either forget how it sounded to them before they learned or they speak a language that i do n't understand so we just sit there quietly . 
  in my mind , this just seems like a formality . 
  like , scotland 's laws are already up to eu standards since it 's a part of the uk which is a member state ... 
  the only way i could see them * not * getting in is if the uk is all bitter and vetos their membership . 
  assuming they 're still in the eu at that point . 
  edit : so what 's the big deal ? 
  while i disagree with you , i upvoted you for contributing to the conversation with a counter point ( i just hate that reddit downvotes whom they disagree with ) . 
  anyways , would n't there be other factors that determine the egalitarian-ness of a society outside of how egalitarian the boards of companies are ? 
  such as education ( example : public school discouraging gender stereotypes ) or access to birth control ( pregnancy is a pretty good reason to miss a meeting ) ? 
  also , i do n't know a lot about iceland , but do you think its high rate of female board members is due to the state requiring them to take up more female members and not because the companies saw these women as valued assets for the company ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i agree that requiring companies to have x number of women / minorities is an effective way to combat racism and sexism , but i think that 's a tool best used when racism and sexism were more mainstream . 
  i ca n't think of anyone in my hometown in america who 'd even consider a white applicant over a black applicant because of race , yet companies are still required to have x number of minority employees . 
  sure , some states ( unfortunately ) this is a problem and i know racism in america is different from sexism in europe , but would n't there come a point where society can drop these rules ? 
  when people become `` blind '' to race / nationality / gender ? 
  * yes !, 
  * a website where i can learn about this and refresh my german . 
  ca n't give gold so have a feel-good . 
  i have and lem me say that people looking for electoral reform in america can learn from these guys . 
  just pushing hard and getting the knowledge out there whenever they can . 
  it seems obvious but unfortunately not enough people actually do it . 
  right ? 
  not even thinking about china here . 
  korea is improving . 
  japan is still kinda important , despite its recession . 
  mongolia has , like , a trillion dollars worth of raw material discovered a few years ago . 
  india has been moving slowly in the right direction in terms of development , and same goes for south-east asia . 
  pretty sure asia 's slow rise is also affecting american - european relations . 
  also , from my experience with british folk , they can not function without their tea time . 
  edit : i 've seen similar things in america . 
  at first i thought the french police were overreacting , until i read the part about him being in touch with anders breivik . 
  also , someone should notify [ r/beards ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/beards ) . 
  i 'm living in mongolia currently and i was talking to some mongolian friends one evening about mongolian slang in their ger . 
  yes , but mongolians also only keep horses for a few seasons and let them go . 
  their horses are still quite feral . 
  i know i 'm american and i know i 'm posting a non-european language to here but here goes . 
  mongolian : mor uzii literally : let 's look at the horses . 
  meaning : let 's take a leak . 
  mongolian : tsetseg awii literally : let 's pick flowers meaning : let 's take a leak the difference between the two is the second one is what women say since women have to squat . 
  edit : formatting, 
  vacation days, 
  exceptionalism, 
  that it 's a fucking awesome country and i want to go back . 
  financial transfers ... i 've not heard of these . 
  does it have to do with programs financed by state and federal governments and development stuff in the east ? 
  hmm i see your point and i guess i was n't too familiar with variations of how the lists are made . 
  do n't get me wrong i think mmp would be a huge improvement to fptp , i guess i just need more time toying with the idea or if i move to germany ( hopefully in the near future ) i can see first hand how it works . 
  agreed . 
  we need to just start over . 
  i also like the mmp system and think america should adopt something like it for our congressional elections ( among like , a million other things i would change ) , but my main criticism of mmp and party-list proportional is it seems to give a lot of power to political parties since they make the lists . 
  i think there used to be more political parties waaaaaay back in the day but fptp tends to trend to just a two-party system anyways , even with one of the parties dying occasionally ( the uk was dominated by the tories and liberals and later the tories and labour , and maybe the lib dems will replace labour ) . 
  and two - party systems are simply about `` beating the other guy '' as you said , rather than compromise you get in coalition governments . 
  then again , my experience with political parties is just the democrats and the republicans who are both very powerful and very incompetent , so it probably biases me a little . 
  edit : two parties , not to parties . 
  i like the schulze method , but like other users have said , maybe preferential voting would be a better compromise since it 's kind of a dumbed down version of schulze . 
  i think mmp also reduces tactical voting , but i just think it gives a little too much power and influence to political parties since they make the list and youre much more likely to get a seat if you 're a member of a party . 
  how about the world ? 
  some of these ideas are pretty cool , others just seem a bit silly . 
  there 's a similar citizen 's initiative in switzerland for an unconditional basic income . 
  if it passes , it 'd be cool to see how it works out . 
  edit : words , how do they work . 
  i have a big problem with the `` our people are not perfect but our culture is superior to others '' one because you 're kind of an asshole no matter how you answer . 
  graduated in 2007 from high school . 
  ** omitted ** a ) how horrible early white settlers were to native americans , both during initial colonization and as the us expanded westward . 
  b ) exactly how the new deal and ww2 spending boosted the american economy out of the great depression ( or at least at my school ) . 
  c ) any war / conflict that happened after the vietnam war ( especially if it involves anything with the middle east ) . 
  ** emphasized ** a ) how the civil war was more about state rights than slavery itself ( i should note i 'm from the south and kind of proud that several classmates basically called the teacher out on this one ) . 
  b ) how the world is so grateful for how we intervene in ... everything . 
  c ) how america is the oldest continual republic ( ignoring that the icelandic parliament has been around hella longer ) and how we are better than europe and unique in the world because we 're basically descended from europeans who saw the light and left to try something new , ignoring potentially similar countries like australia and canada . 
  only gay people can turn a prison sentence into an awesome time . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  in mongolia ( where i live ) , most people perceive homosexuality as either non-existant or just a foreign phenomenon . 
  you 're more likely to find mongolians who are `` out of the closet '' in ub . 
  well , just glancing at it , it would look like the rest of europe is luke warm about the eu but the uk , greece , and others just hate the eu . 
  whoever made that map should have made the colors more gradual . 
  plus , the legend says ` people who like the eu minus those who do n't '' . 
  that 's a very weird way to word it . 
  the coloring is very misleading . 
  live in mongolia , it 's the only way to buy milk . 
  well , hudoo milk , at least . 
  of yees , komrad . 
  s ' k bruh . 
  hence the sarcasm . 
  now someone do the holy roman empire . 
  you know . 
  rome volume ii, 
  ^ this right here is an example of how westerners conflate extremism with people who just use the term . 
  i know what it * actually is * , but that 's not how western media and most westerners understand it . 
   contrary to popular belief `` allah akbar '' is not the international code signal for extremists . 
  the problem is that it 's popular belief . 
  even if most people here know that , it does n't change the fact that `` allah akbar '' is now closely associated with extremism . 
  ninja edit : not that does n't make the association right . 
  i think because of the association with fundamentalist islam do most westerners get a little nervous or jump to conclusions when they hear `` allah akbar '' , especially when shouted and while they throw bottles . 
  if the context had been at the end of a prayer or a speech maybe , but i 'd assume most westerners wo n't understand arabic ( or whatever they 're speaking ) and might assume the worse . 
  sad but true . 
   the problem has to be solved in syria , it wont be solved in europe .
