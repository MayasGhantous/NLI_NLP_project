  he probably pays a bunch actors to `` live '' in the town and a bunch of hispanic migrant workers to wander around in three background to make it feel more real to him . 
   so are you saying that the muslims in eu are the victims of imperialism , `` racism '' and wars ? 
  not all , but a lot yes . 
   ... eu has to be a hell for all of these poor `` opressed '' people . 
  not as bad as the hells in the middle east that the us military and its allies created . 
  and i would think the bigots living in the eu are making trouble for them , not the eu itself . 
  something something sam harris . 
  instead of talking about islam itself as the problem , why not talk about how imperialism , racism , and war can radicalize huge populations into an `` us vs them '' mentality . 
  isolating and identifying islam and muslims as the `` problem '' only exacerbates this problem . 
  if zorasterianism were the main religion in the middle east today , i think you 'd see the same kind of radicalizaiton you see in islam , and not because of any particular quality of zorasterianism . 
  damn i almost wrote `` als erwartet '' too , but was unsure if i 've ever used that . 
  thanks . 
  germany is a bit higher than expected . 
   `` utterly predictable '' - oracle of delphi i fucking lost it . 
  american from georgia here . 
  as far as i know , corporal punishment is legal in the home , but there 's a limit and a judge is usually the one who decides when a parent has gone too far . 
  as for schools , it 's completely illegal in all georgia public schools . 
  private schools are allowed to but the law requires written consent of the parents each school year . 
  the legal reasoning for this is that parents are paying for their own child 's education and if they want their teachers smacking their kid once in a while , they can . 
  not all private schools do corporal punishment , however , just the weird presbyterian schools . 
   ... the issue as apparently the irish had arranged gay adoption seperately from marriage equality ... 
  he 's not irish , how is he suppose to know that the irish people already had a debate over it ? 
  if you heard that japan or an american state was going to hold a referendum on same-sex marriage and some of the `` no '' posters were making references to adoption or surrogacy being a problem ( in their opinion , not mine ) , would n't you assume that this was an unresolved issue in that country ? 
  and bringing up that those issues would likely become part of the debate , that 's not irrelevant at all . 
  even if it 's something the irish have already discussed and resolved , him bringing it up just means he 's not up-to-date with irish politics and does n't mean he 's a detractor . 
  pretty telling of this sub that you 're being downvoted for contributing to the conversation , even if it 's an unpopular perspective on here . 
  other redditors are trying to point out how surrogacy and adoption do n't always go with marriage in their countries legally , but they 're ignoring any resistance there may be to those laws . 
  not saying / u/darthmagikarp does n't bring up a good point that it 's an emotive argument to bring up surrogacy and adoption even though that 's not what the referendum is about , but you also make a good point in that it 's likely to be the next issue . 
  that and note the disagree / agree categories are labelled `` strongly agree / agree '' and `` strongly disagree / disagree '', 
  i have such a phonetic phallus for this . 
   500,000 euro to have a passport ... soooooo the exact kind of foreigners whom ukip would deem `` tha good furreners '' . 
  me too . 
  got you all beat . 
  the user i was responding to originally suggested that his negative experience of his neighborhood informed his opinion of hispanics . 
  i countered with my own more neutral experience to point out his experience is n't 100 % applicable . 
  he then countered with statistics . 
  i suggested that basing his opinion on what an entire group of people are like on statistics is somewhat xenophobic since he probably is n't bothering to interact with them . 
  oh i 'm sorry i thought you were basing your negative feelings on some negative experiences . 
  but if you 're going to judge your neighbors based on some stats on the internet , i think you may be a xenophobe . 
  i see , your random anecdote about your beighborhood is a statistic . 
  nice . 
  well i 'm sorry you live in a bad community , but my community is ok and other than being a bit poorer than the rest of the town , there 's not a lot different between here and the rest of the town . 
  do you see how this works ? 
   do you live in a majority hispanic community ? 
  i do . 
  i 'll take your word for it , but yes i do . 
  it 's not `` fun '' , it 's just a community , only en espanol . 
  ima need some sources cited , please . 
  yes and lem me tell ya it pisses me off to see and hear people using a language that 's not my own in my neighborhood . 
  it 's scary , people !, 
  what 's going on with latvia . 
  click bait article is click bait . 
  corporations did n't exist the same way when the constitution was written than they do now . 
  of course the founders meant flesh and blood people , that was all they could imagine . 
  groups of people can protest and even collectively express their support by sending chunks of money . 
  unions and non-profits do this already , with limits on what the organization can give from its own coffers , but less so on what the individuals could give from their own pockets . 
  the majority opinion in * citizens united v. federal election commission * was `` well corporations are just groups of people , so why ca n't the group have the same protections as the individuals ? 
  '' , which is pretty much your argument ( i gather ) . 
  a problem with that is the rights enurmerated in the constitution were clearly meant for individual people and limiting what an organization could do does not limit those individual rights . 
  the dissenting argument in the * citizens united * case makes this point as well as the dangers between not distinguishing corporate personhood and individuals . 
  a probelm with your mlk metaphor is that no one was part of any association or organization . 
  some might have been members of the black panthers or secular student alliance , but you would n't say that the `` person '' of the black panthers attended . 
  that is like saying the `` person '' of the united methodist church attended cause some marchers were members and that 's ridiculous . 
  you and everyone else would recognize that they 're individuals with no * mlk marchers club * uniting them , and since the right to assembly is granted in the constitution to individual people , a particularly big protest is n't going to be dispersed for being `` too big '' . 
  another problem with your metaphor is that you were talking about just showing up somewhere and protesting and making speeches . 
  that 's very different from political campaign donations for multiple reasons . 
  when people show up somewhere to protest they 're simply making their voices known and how the media or the press presents your protest to the rest of the country can determine how well it resonants with politicians and other citizens . 
  campaign donations have a direct impact on the candidate because it means more cities and states that they can visit and more ads that they can put on tv . 
  more exposure means a bigger chance of getting people to vote for you . 
  this creates a scenario where politicians are likely to give their ear to people who 've donated more , even if they do n't want to . 
  the reason why associations of people have had greater caps on how much they could donate is because associations often have greater sums of money that any individual . 
  especially corporations . 
  general motors has 12 people on the board of directors . 
  we can safely assume that they 're millionaires . 
  gm made a profit of $ 154 billion in 2015 . 
  if the board likes a candidate , what 's stopping the board from each donating a million individually and then another 10 million from gm ? 
  that 's $ 22 million to whichever candidate , and you know they 're not gon na make the distinction between `` the board '' and `` general motors '' . 
  all twelve members of the board could show up in front of the white house with signs and protest this and that , and that is their right . 
  but the media is just gon na see 12 angry old people and that 's not gon na get their point accross . 
  of course they 're gon na wan na donate as much money as possible , potentially squashing any mlk scale protest . 
  i 'm aware of the theories , and the loan words could easily be from close contact . 
  one theory is that the ural-altaic `` family '' could just be a koine language , which is a kind of common dialect that arises between two language groups who are in constant contact . 
  i know this theory is one for the `` altaic family '' ( the classification of mongolic , turkic , and tungsic families as subgroups of this family is controversial as well ) would make sense considering these language groups sit along the silk road . 
  the uralic link to the so-called altaic group could be similarly explained as a possible koine language . 
  the findings of a few words that seem to be identical is really interesting , but it 's possible that it 's coincidential since we see similar sounding words with the same semantic meaning popping up in completely unrelated languages as well . 
  i think that 's just a coincidence considering that no other words in mongolian and estonian share genetic relation , or at least do n't appear to . 
  found something else !, 
  the mongolian word i know for `` world '' is '' \u0434\u044d\u043b\u0445\u0438\u0439 '' ( delhii ) but i went to [ this dictionary ] ( http://www.bolor-toli.com/dictionary/word?authenticity_token=qu4er77nggmribmexwphb0dwjat89hrtfsdxf3knek0%3d&amp;selected_lang=4-1&amp;search=world ) and found that '' \u043e\u0440\u0447\u043b\u043e\u043d '' ( orchlon ) is an entry . 
  further clicking and asking a mongolian friend over facebook revealed it specifically means `` universe '' . 
  it appears the kalmyk word you have on your map is correct !, 
  edit : noticed in your russian dictionary that '' \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043a\u04d9 `` is also a definition , looks a lot like '' \u0434\u044d\u043b\u0445\u0438\u0439 '' , eh ? 
  notice the k -  h pattern i described earlier . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/caucasus-ethnic_en.svg kalmyk is mongolic . 
  the kalmyk people moved from western mongolia sometime at the start of the qing dynasty ( i believe ) and moved west til they eventually settled in the caucaus region . 
  kalmyk language is derived from oirat which is sometimes labeled a dialect of mongolian and sometimes a seperate language . 
  i happen to speak mongolian and lived in uvs province in mongolia ( the oirat `` homeland '' ) and in my own opinion it 's a dialect , though there could be some villages that speak some varient that 's definitely a different language . 
  [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/caucasus-ethnic_en.svg ) is some shit on `` kalmyk oirat '' , there 's not a lot on wikipedia unfortunately . 
  i know that the oirat dialect is spoken a lot in western mongolia and some parts of western china ( xinjiang and gansu ) but usually in just small communities . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln0kqmtvori ) is a neat little video about the mongolic languages spoken today . 
  the map is mostly accurate and you should know that the solid green bits is standard mongolian ( aka khalkha mongol ) spoken in mongolia and the green stripe bit is khalkha mongol spoken in china , but you can see that oirat and other mongolian languages / dialects are spoken in china , russia , and kazakhstan as well .
