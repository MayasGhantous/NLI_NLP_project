have you compared canned guinness to bottled guinness ? 
  the canned tastes better . 
  obviously if there 's draft then it trumps all but canned guinness ai n't bad .

  because welcome to / r/europe . 
  teachers and parents have been telling high school girls to dress modestly since the beginning of time . 
  i 'm not sure what it has to do with muslims . 
   in the face of extremism , i do n't think it 's an asshole move to mock any faith . 
  does n't matter if it 's an asshole move or not . 
  the question is , does it help solve the problem ? 
  how often does pissing off extremists help to avoid violent conflict and breed common understanding ? 
  a 2-second google agrees with you . 
  i guess i can think of at least one popa now that i focus on it . 
  is n't the last name in romania `` pop '' ? 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen a `` popa '' like in the image . 
  i live there . 
  you are correct in your assessment . 
  in one light , it 's refreshing after the relatively blind nationalism of the states . 
  on the other hand , there is n't much drive to improve because `` that 's just the way things are here . '', 
  because the internet never knee-jerks and then settles down or even pulls a 180 , right ? 
  compared to where i 'm from , yeah they 're pretty good . 
  there 's also the mad construction that went on all last year and is continuing this year . 
  it seems like they 're trying to replace every single road in cluj . 
  and bury any cables that are strung along the road as they go . 
  cluj even has bike lanes , now . 
  they actually spray for mosquitoes . 
  i 'm not really an exception  i moved here when she still lived here . 
  she then went to go study in barcelona and i 've been trying to move there , it just takes a while because i 'm not european . 
  them : where are you from ? 
  me : america them : so , what are you studying ? 
  me : actually i 'm working here . 
  them : what ? 
  why ? 
  in romania ? 
  why would you come here nothing makes sense anymore - wait , there 's a girl , is n't there ? 
  me : makes sense now , does n't it ? 
  ^ ( ` course , she lives in barcelona but that 's another story ) sound familiar ? 
  ten years from now , romanians are going to be complaining that people from the uk keep immigrating here and taking all the jobs . 
  young people , yes , but if you 're 30 + and traveling around the romanian countryside , i would guess that you 'll mostly be dealing with people your age and older . 
  i mean , i think you 'd be fine ordering food and buying things from stores , but it 'll be tough to `` talk to the people '' . 
  most educated romanians i 've met have little/no faith in their government or their `` fellow countrymen '' ( ` taranesti ' ) . 
  i guess it 's hard ( painful ) to see the amount of corruption and bribery that 's a part of normal life when you 're exposed to more ` enlightened ' countries . 
  or at least that 's the perception . 
  however , hearing stories about doctors refusing to operate to save lives unless they 're paid extra makes me sympathize with them . 
  i do think many romanians are overly hard on their country , but at the same time ... there 's still a ways to go . 
   driving around the romanian countryside  talking to the people hah , good luck with that unless you know romanian . 
  the countryside truly is beautiful , though , and the food is great . 
  if you 're interested in music , there are a bunch of concerts in spring/summer , too . 
  check out electric castle ( cluj ) , summerwell ( near bucharest ) , untold festival ( cluj if it happens in 2016 ) . 
  edit : some pictures i 've taken , mostly around transylvania : http://imgur.com/a/x8hzj, 
  username checks out ? 
  i took wizz once . 
  had no problems . 
  did it like 10 more times , still no problems . 
  yup , i saw that example and that 's when i added my edit . 
  evolution is a bit too complicated to say , `` well , it obviously does n't help a single organism to procreate , therefore it 's against evolution '' ( like i was thinking at first ) , because evolution is about which traits have led to a greater number of surviving/strong offspring . 
  and calculating something like that is complex . 
  i would n't say it 's necessarily based on religion at all . 
  ~ ~ if you look at it from a purely evolutionary perspective , you get a similar result . ~ ~ edit : actually i do n't think i 'm qualified to speak on this . 
  evolution is complicated . 
  probably just an american black site , nothing to worry yourself about . 
  really ? 
  there was a security/police/something standing outside one of the buildings in cluj , i passed it very often and he was always there . 
  he was carrying some sort of scary-looking assault rifle ( dunno exactly what , but it was no handgun ) .

   / r/anarchism , has banned me i 've never been there , but ... is n't it a little funny that there are moderators in / r/anarchism ? 
  floating neighborhoods ? 
  that 's nothing !, 
  [ we have floating cities !, 
  ] ( http://discoverhistorictravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/new-orleans-flooding.jpg ) ^ ( too soon ? ), 
  and the love from the lindens ? 
  your really letting lose , are n't you ? 
  yeah , i lived in cluj for ~ 1.5 yrs . 
  great city . 
  i have n't been to enigma , though , because it opened just after i moved out . 
  i 'm going back next month to visit ( need a cazier judiciar din romania ) so i 'll try to hit it up . 
  is it worth seeing ? 
  also , is it non-smoking ? 
  cluj seems to be headed that way slowly , which is cool ( to me ) . 
  we are learning from putin . 
  trump is leading the republican race . 
  and sometimes there are other moves that will satisfy your needs but also avoid giving the enemy what they want . 
  if you do n't consider their goals , then you might not see those moves . 
  like in chess . 
  uh , no . 
  you have to consider why they want it . 
  i would n't call it pedantic . 
  that implies that most people know what you meant and i was unnecessarily clarifying minor details . 
  i expect that many people would be surprised at how many people can be represented by a proper poll of a very small number of people . 
  using `` represented '' and `` polled '' interchangeably can lead to incorrect assumptions because of how easy to is to choose a misleading sample population ( and sensationalism travels faster than proofreading ) . 
  thanks for providing a source . 
   based on a pew poll of 900 million muslims that 's inaccurate . 
  it says `` 900 million represented '' . 
  they did n't interview 900 million muslims , they picked a small fraction of that number , polled them , and then extrapolated out that the poll could represent 900 million muslims based on the acceptable margin of error . 
  they need ** less than 500 people ** to take the poll and they can conceivably choose the group of people to interview so that the results will look the way they want to achieve a goal . 
  edit : from the [ source article ] ( http://www.atheoryofus.net/islam-statistics ) :  ... be aware that someone might respond to a question with a particular answer not because they genuinely believe it , but because they think that is how they should answer it . 
  for example , a catholic might answer that they believe the bread and wine in communion literally become the flesh and blood of christ not because they actually believe it does , but because they believe they should believe it . 
  ( and keep in mind that ** the interviews carried out by pew would often be conducted in front of one 's family members in the family home ** . ), 
  not in prison . 
  `` ship '' vs `` sheep '' is another one that seemingly all non-native english speakers ca n't deal with ( this is based on my sample size of , like , two ) .
