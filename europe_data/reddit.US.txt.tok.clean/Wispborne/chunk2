  they both are pronounced as `` sheep '' or halfway between the two . 
  are there other languages whose speakers have no trouble with this `` i '' sound ? 
  hey , we 're releasing minor drug offenders from prison , so we have some extra space . 
  send us your politicians !, 
  to steal from [ somebody else 's answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3rgz0d/romanian_pm_victor_ponta_resigns/cwo0w4y ) :  [ the club only had ] the normal permit to open a club  they had that from townhall  the way the permit was given didnt respect procedure anyway  and inspectors who were there a week earlier failed to notice the main problems the club had ( just that staff didnt know to use fire extinguishers iirc and still they didnt close the club )  for fireworks they needed permit from somewhere else i think . . firemen maybe the government has to be a role model for the country . 
  that 's how leadership works . 
  ponta was seen as a role model for `` good enough '' and corruption . 
  the former was definitely a cause for the nightclub fire , and the latter probably was . 
  not romanian , american . 
  lived in romania for 1.5 yrs . 
  one of the reasons that the voltzwagon thing was such a big deal is that nobody expected it . 
  germans are known for their engineering , voltzwagon is the people 's car , generally well-regarded afaik , etc. 
  germany does n't have a reputation of economic transgressions . 
  now , imagine that it was the other way around . 
  german cars are generally known to have worse mileage than other cars . 
  the german pm flies an airliner to work each day . 
  her whole cabinet drives hummers . 
  she claims that her airliner takes 5 liters/100km ( ~ 50 miles/gallon ) . 
  the people are sick of the lack of attention given to the environment . 
  * then * , the voltzwagon scandal comes up , and boom . 
  tipping point . 
  sure , maybe the pm did n't directly cause the volzwagon thing , but if she and her cronies were all basically symbols of destroying the environment , you can bet that the people are going to blame them for it because it 's the catalyst for change that has been coming for a while . 
  it used to be that you could see how controversial something was because you could see both the upvotes and the downvotes , but now it just looks like everybody either agrees with a comment or they all disagree with it . 
  i wish they 'd revert that change . 
  it 's important to see how many people stand on each side of an issue . 
  since i joined , / r/europe has been strictly anti-middle-eastern-immigration , with most dissenting opinions getting downvoted . 
  i see some pretty out-there comments upvoted sometimes . 
  shows how often i get into these discussions . 
   american football is a turn based strategy game . 
  this is beautiful . 
  hope you do n't mind if i use it the next time i 'm home . 
  it 's a fine difference , i was n't sure which is why i checked that dictionary . 
  for both of your examples , i 'd say that they 're using the intransitive verb . 
  if you said , `` the crew members that survived them [ their drowned mates ] had stayed in the coastal city that day ... '' then that 's when i would see the other definition come into play . 
  your first example really could go either way if i think about it , but at first glance i definitely read both of them as , `` the crew members that survived the drowning '' and not `` the crew members that survived their crewmates '' . 
  all that said , i 'm a software developer with a small passion for english and the only writing i do is code documentation . 
  we need to get english.stackexchange.com up in here as arbiters . 
  that 's a different meaning of the word . 
  http://www.thefreedictionary.com/survived `` survived by '' = to live longer than ; outlive < - transitive `` survived '' = to remain alive or in existence < - intransitive, 
  yeah , i was making a cheeky comment . 
  they said to read `` opinionated news '' , which reddit definitely qualifies for . 
  on the immigration issue , i 'm from the northeast part of the states so i 'm already on the opposite side of / r/europe on the migration issue and i see the other side 's opinion every time i read the comments here . 
  we do n't have many immigrants up where i lived , and from what i 've seen it 's largely regions that have immigrants who have problems with immigrants ( hmmm ... probably just coincidence / s ) . 
   i 'd argue it 's as important to read opinionated news anyway as you find out why the two sides of issues disagree . 
  reddit handles that pretty well  thanks , i 'll check out reuters . 
  my reaction was pretty knee-jerky . 
  tbh i 've been mostly happy with the bbc and , as you say , this is a minor thing . 
  i 'd still be curious for more news sources , though . 
  i 'd like to supplement the bbc and / r/europe is not exactly a great source of unbiased news . 
  `` survive '' , `` survivor '' , `` surviving '' are pretty powerful words . 
  `` the rest of the migrants '' or `` the remaining migrants '' would have been sufficient . 
  what news site ( s ) do you recommend instead ? 
  i switched to the bbc a long time ago from the typical american shitfeast ( cnn/fox ) and i 'm disappointed to hear that the bbc is showing biases/minor sensationalism now . 
  surely that will show that we 're more enlightened . 
  i would have said the same about the american system last year . 
  i really like this comment . 
  i did n't vote and i feel terrible about it ( filled out the absentee ballot , then procrastinated too long on mailing it ) , ** but ** i am a resident of vermont , which * always * votes [ democratic ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/vt ) . 
  so while i did hurt statistics on overseas voters and did n't vote in my own state 's elections , it 's not like my vote would have mattered in the national election , and , more importantly , if i had been voting in a swing state , you can bet your ass i would have motivated * my * lazy ass . 
  food is really subjective , i bolded the `` imo '' but could have stressed it further . 
  i like pinxos , potato pancakes , and orxata , but find paella to be extremely overrated , tapas to be overly expensive , and patatas bravas are just glorified french fries ( not mcdonalds fries , but real fries from a good place ) . 
  overall i like that romanian food has more emphasis on main courses , rather than smaller dishes . 
  the food is heavier but there are also plenty of soups , which you barely find in traditional spanish fare . 
  i grew up in new england ( northeastern usa ) , so seafood is nothing special to me ( i noticed that romanians seem to have an infatuation with it ) . 
  clam chowder is better than literally any spanish seafood i 've had thus far . 
  another point that i left out is restaurant/bar personality . 
  compare romania to barcelona , the average bars . 
  romanian bars , at least what i 've come across , have identity . 
  you know their name , they have a style , a music track , often their own drink menu , logo . 
  there 's a bar in cluj where all the furniture is made from cardboard . 
  another has nature decorations all over . 
  another is styled after the life of ernest hemmingway . 
  another is called `` cobbler '' ( cismarie ) and has shoes all over . 
  then there 's the average spanish bar in barcelona . 
  tv with football : check . 
  cheap chairs : check . 
  gambling machine : check . 
  name : ? 
  no idea , they all seem to be called `` coca cola '' . 
  personality : not check . 
  barcelona 's big , and there are plenty of bars with their own style , but they feel like the exception rather than the norm , and often they 're just as filled with foreigners as natives . 
  again ; subjective whether this is a bother . 
  i grew up in a place with a culture of huge beer variety and bars that had their own identity , so bcn 's copy-paste bars are a turnoff for me and cluj 's unique bars are interesting and fun . 
  ok , thanks . 
  it 's amazing how well implemented it is , from what i 've seen . 
  when i left cluj a year ago , smoke was everywhere . 
  first time back since then and it 's almost as though you were never allowed to smoke indoors . 
  really expected a more half-assed implementation ( i expect it is like that in smaller villages ) and more leftover ashtray smell . 
  depends on what you want and who you know . 
  barcelona is great . 
  awesome nightlife , perfect * weather , huge international scene for meeting others , most things are reasonably priced , fantastic public transportation , really nice beaches ** , tons of variety in the central area in food/culture/design . 
  however . 
  apartments are expensive , spaniards are terrible at english \\*\\*\\* , catalonia is always vying for independence , spain 's economy is shit , there 's a lot of dissatisfaction with the government , some tension with tourism and airbnb , spanish food is mediocre ( ** imo ** ) , spanish or at least catalonians tend to be quite prideful , and some services are pretty crap ( eg . 
  internet/cellphone carriers are nearly as bad as the usa , the public healthcare often has 3 + month queue , and there 's a big culture of `` i do n't give a shit about your problem '' in those areas . 
  oh , and their immigration system is beyond horrible . ) . 
  \\* if you like warm sun all the time , personally i do n't . 
  \\* * i do n't really care about the beach . 
  \\* ** and my spanish is barely existent . 
  now for romania , or specifically cluj : cluj also has a really good nightlife , most young people speak english well , everything is super cheap , have you seen the internet speeds oh my god , the food is excellent , they mostly like or accept foreigners , they have really nice forests and mountains nearby , the language ( like spanish ) comes from latin so it 's not that hard ( but still harder than spanish ) , the women are beautiful , they have lots of parties and festivals for stuff like film , theater , music , culture , even it ( spain does too ) . 
  i could go on . 
  but i 'll leave with the last thing , which i think is super important : romania is rising , and spain is n't .
