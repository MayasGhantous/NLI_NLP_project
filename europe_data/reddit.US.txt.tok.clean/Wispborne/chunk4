  when the snow stops ( it snowed yesterday morning ) , winter tires come off . 
  you can get by with all-season tires , but it can get pretty dicey and if you live on a sloped road , there are days you 're just not going home without winter tires . 
   there are plenty of examples of ethnic europeans getting radicalized .

  20 years ago ? 
  oh yeah , it 's pretty hard to generalize about the us . 
  we 've got a lot of people who force their religion on other people way too much . 
  just quoting another user above me . 
  7 years for being gay does n't make it sound much better . 
  i get what you 're saying but the disparity is funny . 
  10-20 years in jail and possibly the gulag , vs career ender . 
  english really needs more creative words added by our overseas friends . 
  & nbsp ; except for france . 
  that 's how english got so wrong in the first place . 
   beflummoxed, 
  i 've done it and found it lame . 
  i was near barcelona , not all parts look the same obviously . 
  where i was , there were not enough tall trees , too many roads , not enough of a forest feel . 
  we pitched a tent off a seldom-used trail , out of eyesight because it was n't legal . 
  no fire of course . 
  we also did n't have a car so it limited out options a lot . 
  i 'm sure there are plenty of great places to camp , especially if you have a car . 
  but it 's not really seen as normal , from what i could tell . 
  [ meanwhile in america . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wisconsin-shooting-iduskbn16u076 )  a police officer and three other people were killed in a string of shootings , including at a bank and a law firm , in central wisconsin following what police referred to as domestic incident, 
  and how many of them were in turkey ? 
  our work slack group had a legit session of the irish office calling out the american office for a work party sign with `` st patty 's day '' written on it . 
  i tried to convince you guys that it was the americanized version of the holiday , not the irish version , but it did n't work very well . 
  anyway , merry saint patties day !, 
  dunno , i 've known some pretty smart rednecks . 
  when i think `` just plain dumb '' , i think ` white trash ' or maybe ` hicks ' . 
  mersi , i 'm from vermont so i basically know french by proximity . 
  no i do n't . 
  italian and romanian have more similar pronunciations ( and inflections ? ), 
  though , so they 'll be easier to understand . 
  for example , i * think * ( i do n't know * any * italian ) , the word `` dacia '' will be pronounced `` dacheeya '' ( using ` murican phonetics ) in both languages . 
  french sounds pretty unique , even if more words are technically shared , i would n't be at all surprised if nobody could tell because they 'd spell it `` daciouxeauoeax '' and pronounce it `` daugh '' . 
  my mistake - i thought you were implying something , rather than just asking for clarification .

  inb4 `` you excluded romani from romanian search '' yes , i did . 
  they are a minority , culturally , linguistically , and socially distinct from romanians , and not even originally from romania ( probably ) . 
  it was funded ? 
  i was at the one in cluj last night , where do i go to get my payout ? 
  you really would be okay with being on the receiving end of a muslim county 's punishments ?

  ( warning : naked people on a beach , nsfw if you are american ) edit : oh , * bitch * , not beach , sorry . 
  i 'm not even romanian and i think i could hear the accent . 
  or maybe that 's just his style of talking . 
  well , klaus is fine . 
  romania should just stick to electing germans . 
  did you miss 2016 ? 
  it 's pretty good , other than the winner-take-all part . 
  bb guns are a type of air gun designed to fire spherical metal projectiles similar to shot pellets of approximately the same size .

   stole the romanian thesaurus and by thesaurus you mean treasure , right ? 
  i could be just showing my ignorance , but there * are * two bars in cluj , one called [ klausen ] ( https://untappd.com/v/klausen-the-pub/739302 ) and one called [ klausen burger ] ( http://klausenburger.ro/ ) . 
  afaik the bars are unrelated , but their names could be related to `` klausenburg '' . 
  edit : in fact , `` klausen burger '' is almost definitely a pun on `` klausenburg '' , and now that i see it it seems really obvious . 
  it 's for their unification day , which was on 1 dec. 
  it 's pretty much akin to many countries ' independence day . 
   it commemorates the assembly of the delegates of ethnic romanians held in alba iulia , which declared the union of transylvania with romania . 
   this holiday was set after the romanian revolution and it marks the unification of transylvania , but also of the provinces of bessarabia and bukovina with the romanian kingdom , in 1918 . 
  here 's what it looks like from the same location during a normal day ( except street-level because google 's cars ca n't fly yet ) : https://www.google.ro/maps/@46.7687171,23.5897474,3a,75y,23.24h,88.33t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s2vmscx5hmssohfhiz0wo1g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 location is [ pia\u021ba unirii ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/pia%c8%9ba_unirii ) ( en : unity/unification square ) . 
  it 's basically the main downtown area .

   this holiday was set after the romanian revolution and it marks the unification of transylvania , but also of the provinces of bessarabia and bukovina with the romanian kingdom , in 1918 . 
  da , exact . 
  probably pretty easy for them considering the romanian word is \u00eenceputurile . 
  every now and then i hear a romanian break out an underused or archaic english word , yet use it completely correctly , and it throws me for a loop before i realize they 're just translating directly from romanian and the words are nearly the same . 
  came here to say , `` the romanian currency is literally called the lion , how is it not on their coat of arms ? '', 
  good spot , my friend u/cun ... wat, 
  romanian is extremely phonetic . 
  i 'm american and only learned romanian over the course of about 1.5 years ( by exposure , not classes ) and yet you could put pretty much any romanian word in front of me and i 'll be able to tell you how to pronounce it . 
  the letters or combination of letters always make the same sound . 
  whether i can physically pronounce it is a different thing ... damn ` u ' and ` o ' sounds ... 
  anyone know if this exists in romania , and what the translation is ? 
  it 's an idiom or whatever you call it in [ american ] english . 
  `` completely and utterly destroyed '' , for example . 
  but you are nonetheless correct . 
  where does estonian fall ? 
  what a weirdly written and obnoxious ` article ' . 
  was it opinion ? 
  i could n't find an author . 
  i usually like the guardian but what was this . 
  i 'm just telling you what i was told . 
  maybe i misinterpreted what was said , but i do n't think so . 
  either way , i ca n't remember the word and that 's probably a good thing . 
  about hungarians ? 
  i 'm american , living in romania , and i had a romanian ( guy in his 50 's ) tell me last month that there 's a different word for romanian/transylvanian hungarians and hungary hungarians . 
  so if an actual romanian has n't heard of it , i 'd be pretty surprised . 
  or it 's a regional thing ( i 'm in cluj ) . 
  the majority use google . 
  the majority does not use costco . 
  do most people even know what costco is ? 
  let me rephrase . 
  most grocery stores are n't costco . 
  `` writing style '' is a nice way to put it . 
  i 've seen grocery stores that were n't costco . 
  read the comment you just replied to , it has your answer . 
  thanks for writing that .
