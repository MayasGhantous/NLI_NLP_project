  we have all the money that we could ever need - it 's just about spending it wisely and efficiently . 
  keeping europe safe is in america 's interest , and we 've chosen to spend our money to keep it that way . 
  no need to feel guilty about it , 
   and if everyone is doing awfully , then so is the us , because economies do n't exist in a vacuum well that 's one way to ascertain economic information . 
  who needs facts or statistics ?

  well clearly it 's still impacting your country , so you can either pretend that nothing is wrong or you can actually own up to the problem and figure out a solution . 
  simply washing your hands of responsibility since the people who created the problem are dead does n't change reality . 
  haha i do n't think that consequences work like that . 
  the more i watch , the more it appears that europe is about to make the same mistakes that the us did under w. bush . 
  you ca n't solve this sort of crap through military adventures - pretty sure the past decade of american intervention in iraq proved this . 
  you do n't need to arm people and you ca n't `` spread democracy '' in that region . 
  that 's literally what the us tried to do in iraq ( with * trillions * of dollars worth of spending ) and it did n't do shit . 
  if you want a solution , go buy a time machine .

  if you really care about security you wo n't use any 3rd-party cloud-based storage system . 
  roll your own private server . 
  additionally , google likely stores most of european users ' content on servers based in europe for speed reasons . 
  not using them is more of a principle thing than a logical thing . 
   [ bipartisan ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bipartisan ) bi \u00b7 par \u00b7 ti \u00b7 san b\u012b\u02c8p\u00e4rd\u0259z\u0259n / adjective * of or involving the agreement or cooperation of two political parties that usually oppose each other 's policies . 
  *  bipartisanship is a political situation , especially in the context of a two-party system , as is the case for countries such as the united states , in which opposing political parties find common ground through compromise , in theory . 
  this is in contrast to partisanship , where an individual or political party only adheres to their interests without compromise . 
  it has been debated among political theorists however that in practice , each party advances their own political agenda at the expense of the other party because of the conflicting ideologies . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bipartisanship english has lots of oddities . 
  are you a native speaker ? 
  do you mean two-party system ? 
  bipartisan usually means that the parties cooperate . 
  money is the easiest piece of the pie though . 
  it honestly takes a ton of experience to make a military powerful . 
  for better or worse , you ca n't know how your military will perform until it 's game time . 
  the us has been actively waging war for decades now , and the strategies , lessons , and operational guides have changed to reflect what actually works vs what they thought was going to work . 
  this is a good read to learn more : http://www.amazon.com/marine-corps-counterinsurgency-field-manual/dp/0226841510, 
  the beauty and curse of the american system is that even if the same party controls both the house + senate ( congress ) and the executive branch ( president ) , they still ca n't pass laws with a simple majority . 
  this is why healthcare reform was so hard to get through ( they needed 60 % of the senate to pass ) , and if the president is from a different party , the president can veto the bill thus requiring 2/3rds of both chambers to override . 
  it 's actually very , very hard to pass sweeping legislation , which is why despite having the gop controlling both the house and the senate currently , no crazy bills from the gop have actually become laws . 
  in many ways , it 's a good way to keep the crazies from both sides of the aisle from actually wielding power . 
  yeah definitely , gdp is n't a great measure if you want to know how the average person is doing . 
  yes , but consumption is only a fraction of total gdp . 
  remember the basic formula from econ 101 ? 
  net exports , government investment , private investment , taxation , fdi , etc are all not dependent on domestic price levels for consumer goods . 
  adjusting gdp to reflect ppp is n't that useful since greece imports most goods . 
  so while a greek basket of goods is likely cheaper now than it was in 2010 , the average greek is even poorer since they have to buy foreign goods which have become more expensive .

  man , the things that i see upvoted here . 
  first off , this was for q2 , which was before the recent meltdown and banking crisis , and secondly any dead cat will bounce if you drop it from a high enough place . 
  simply growing 1 % for one quarter does n't constitute a recovery at all , and does n't mean that the previous decade of stagnation magically disappeared . 
  it 's just noise in the data . 
  ever been to a major american city ? 
  tons of people get along just fine with a dozen other races . 
  you realize that the us military is already in europe , right ? 
  the carrier fleet plus submarines would be enough firepower to defeat denmark , plus all the troops stationed in germany would be over in a few hours . 
  you do realize that sweden would last a matter of hours against a us military assault ? 
  meanwhile literally no country is capable of invading the us without getting their shit rocked . 
  i really do n't know where this bizarre `` invade america '' bravado is coming from . 
  suuuure , worry about human rights in a enormous developed national all while letting thousands of migrants drown off your coasts . 
  lol i give up . 
  they are n't getting cheese from europe , sure , but how hard is it to understand that a different continent uses the names of regions to signify the * type * of cheese instead of the origin of the cheese ? 
  getting . 
  tricked . 
  err , clearly youtube does n't want it if they intentionally block people from viewing uploaded gema content . 
  it 's not youtube uploading the videos , it 's youtube removing the videos because they do n't want to have anything to do with gema . 
  i do n't think that google loses sleep over lost revenue from german music videos . 
  it 's honestly the german people who lose out and have to use proxies to view the content . 
  the fact that youtube has successfully come to agreements with much larger and powerful american labels tells me that gema is n't being reasonable with their demands . 
  * thank you * . 
  gha this post is so frustrating because there is such a gap in understanding how americans view terminology . 
  we use all of the names as an indication of the style of cheese , not the location that it was produced . 
  nobody is getting fooled by the cheese names haha, 
  no , that 's not true . 
  americans do n't think that they are literally getting italian cheese when they buy parmesan - they just know that they are buying a specific style of cheese . 
  nobody is being lied to if you grow up in the american system of food naming . 
  we just know the names refer to specific styles , not regions , nor do we expect them to be from europe . 
  if i want to know where my feta cheese is coming from i 'll turn the package over and look at the origin information . 
  while this may sound preposterous to you , it 's simply how we name our food products here in the states . 
   but its still not their fault if youtube doesnt want to pay their fees one could argue that it 's their fault because they are n't offering a fair deal to youtube . 
  negotiations are a two-way street - you ca n't entirely blame youtube if gema is making irrational demands . 
  do n't bother with these clowns - they have no clue what they are talking about . 
  eu law = / = international law any more than us laws = / = international laws . 
  international laws are specifically treaties signed by sovereign countries , not rulings from the eu . 
  just because it 's not from your country does n't make it `` international law '' , it just makes it '' * an * international law '' . 
  i think that the difference is subtle but very important . 
  right , google decided that it was morally better to lose billions in revenue than to censor the free internet . 
  when google applies that same logic consistently and refuses to censor search results in the us , suddenly / r/europe is n't a big fan . 
  the hypocrisy is delicious . 
  [ google already did it in spain .

  if a country has laws that google does n't want to follow , they are n't forced to operate in that country . 
  sure they can - they shut down service to 1 billion people in china ... they are totally capable of pulling the plugs out of the google.fr servers . 
  if they were willing to take that risk in the fastest growing economy in the world , they definitely will take that same risk in france . 
  because in one case you are taking down material that has a defined commercial value , and is enforced by interpol internationally as well as the dcma in the us , while the other is taking down personal content that does n't violate any international laws . 
  that and the fact that google is an american company and therefore has far higher pressure to comply with american laws . 
  google could just shut down their french operation just like they did when china was demanding that they change their policies . 
  edit : for the downvoters :  cnil has the power to fine google if it does n't comply , although google can also challenge the order in the courts . 
  if cnil was determined to push its order -- and google lost in the courts -- ** its conceivable that google would pull its search services out of france altogether rather than comply . 
  after all , it pulled out of spain rather than comply with a ruling regarding its google news platform that it considered unacceptable .
