  look at snapchat - facebook was offering them $ 3 billion for the company and they said no . 
  i have a hard time seeing why any european company could n't also say no , especially considering that nobody is offering anywhere near that amount for companies . 
  europeans are certainly active in the startup scene , but they mostly live and work in the us , and start their companies in the us . 
  it 's much easier to hire/fire employees , and there is a ton of investment capital available . 
  so really , very few companies actually get acquired and moved to the us ... it 's more that the founders come over to the us first and set up shop . 
  nothing more american than that to be honest . 
  one of my good friends has romanian parents ( aka she speaks romanian and is much more romanian than most `` i 'm 1/10th irish ! '', 
  americans ) and her parents were very insistent that she went to med school in the us . 
  her dad is also a doctor but immigrated to the us and has pretty strong feelings about `` socialized healthcare '' , haha . 
  while i tend to think that the us is pretty crazy in terms of how much healthcare costs , he saw first-hand what happens when you do n't pay doctors and specialists enough under the communist regime . 
  i 'm sure now he makes 200k + practicing medicine in the us , so it 's understandable that he likes the current system . 
  damn , i had no clue . 
  [ the average monthly salary in my city is $ 6,000 ] ( http://www.indeed.com/salary/boston,-ma.html ) so i really do n't have a good perspective . 
  salaries in the us are almost always reported on an annual basis , aka you make `` 65k '' at your job . 
  that 's why i was confused because very rarely do you hear it broken down by month or by paycheck . 
  while it does vary , most people get paid twice a month in the us . 
  take-home depends greatly on your current tax situation , dependents ( kids ) , marital status , etc , and is automatically deducted from your paycheck by your employer and sent to the irs . 
  whoa . 
  damn did n't realize the wage difference was so crazy . . 
  i was crying to calculate it out weekly and it seemed like 31,000 eur a year before tax was a low , but probably reasonable given ppp . 
  now i just feel like a dick . 
  sorry , i 'm confused . 
  is the 600eur salary your weekly paycheck ? 
  what is the take-home after tax ? 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  the fact that the us has a healthy dialog about consent during sex makes us prudish ? 
  regardless about the fringe cases , it 's in no way a bad thing to encourage better communication between partners . 
  also , have you actually ever lived in a us city while single ? 
  it 's anything but prudish . 
  ahahaha it 's hilarious how some people actually take everything they read on reddit at face value . 
  i 'm cracking up envisioning someone refusing to travel to boston because some school in texas lets you carry on campus . 
  to be honest , this crisis really does n't have anything to do with the imf . 
  it instead has to do with the fact that the majority of northern european countries bailed out their own commercial banks ( that made bad investments in greece ) via the loans and funds from the ecb and ez member nations . 
  the imf is there as a lender of last resort , and certainly not blameless , but would n't need to be involved if the eurozone was structured better . 
   what 's really happened is that since greece ran into serious trouble repaying its debts four years ago , germany , france and the eu have instituted what can only be described as a massive bailout of its own financial system -- shifting the burden from its banks to taxpayers . 
   last week , asset manager mike shedlock republished research by eric dor , a french business school director , and it shows the magnitude of the shift . 
  to put it simply , german taxpayers are on the hook for roughly $ 40 billion in greek debt . 
  german banks ? 
  just $ 181 million , though they do hold $ 5.9 billion in exposure to greek banks . 
  those numbers are a flip-flop from where things stood less than five years ago . 
   this massive shift from private gains to public losses was done through the european financial stability facility . 
  created in 2010 , this was the european union 's answer to the u.s. troubled asset relief program , the treasury department 's 2008 bailout program . 
  there are some differences . 
  the efsf issues bonds , for instance , but the principle is the same . 
  governments buy bad bank debt and hold it on the public 's books . 
   the terms set by the efsf are basically what 's at issue when we hear about greece 's new government being opposed to austerity in their nation . 
  source : http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-wall-street-squeezed-greece-and-germany-2015-01-27 tl ; dr : germany et al more or less saved their own banks at the expense of greece . 
  loans generally last for years , so they basically admitted that they would n't do the same thing again . 
  the current loans that are coming due were likely negotiated before the mea culpa . 
  also , the `` washington consensus '' is opposed to austerity ( look up obama 's comments ) , but the imf is n't controlled by the us . 
  therefore it is still mostly aligned with mainland ( ie german ) european economics via the position in the troika . 
  [ the imf already officially recognized that austerity was a failure in greece . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/05/imf-greek-bailout-notable-failures_n_3391961.html ) the holdouts are the europeans . 
  where is your source ? 
  amazon is still advertising reddit as a full client , which would n't be allowed if they were n't using aws anymore ... http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/web-mobile-social/, 
  lol wrong and wrong . 
  http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/reddit/  san francisco-based reddit offers an online social news site , reddit.com , for sharing user-generated ideas , images and links . 
  the site , ** which runs entirely on aws , ** can scale to handle 4 billion page views per month . 
  only the https portion of the site runs through cloudflare , as clearly stated in your link . 
   seems you just came to spread ignorance . 
  oh the irony . 
  edit : [ here 's the keynote slideshow from aws 's summit in sydney literally last month . 
  ] ( http://www.slideshare.net/amazonwebservices/sydney-summitkeynote ) guess which customer is front and center on their `` startup customers '' list ? 
  reddit is a us company that runs its cdn via amazon aws , which is also an american company . 
  they do n't need to comply with eu laws because they would just tell amazon to keep the data on non-eu servers , thus making the experience slower for europeans but legal since the us has much stronger tolerance for anonymous free speech . 
  quality reply , [ especially considering that net migration from mexico to the us is actually flat or declining . 
  ] ( http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/04/23/net-migration-from-mexico-falls-to-zero-and-perhaps-less/ ), 
  bit of both . 
  from wikipedia :  webster was a proponent of english spelling reform for reasons both philological and nationalistic . 
  in a companion to the american revolution ( 2008 ) , john algeo notes : `` it is often assumed that characteristically american spellings were invented by noah webster . 
  he was very influential in popularizing certain spellings in america , but he did not originate them . 
  rather [ ... ] he chose already existing options such as center , color and check ** on such grounds as simplicity , analogy or etymology '' ** . 
  emphasis mine . 
  which is why american english is basically as utilitarian as possible - webster wrote it to almost be a simplified version of oxford english . 
  america is too young to have history tied to a language , and honestly i prefer it that way . 
  freedom to communicate however you want . 
  english to me is just a tool , but i love reading classic french literature and would one day love to learn enough russian to read the great classics in their native tongue as well . 
  have fun with that policy - your continent will be half gone by 2100 . 
  this is the type of hubris that i 'm talking about . 
  markets are anything but rational - nobody has priced in a complete grexit and nobody knows what happens to the ez if sovereign yields come under fire from international investors . 
  the second that there is blood in the water , all bets are off . 
  while the us was able to fight off the sharks with massive capital injections and communication from the fed , the ecb is not nearly as fast and capital injections are off the table via political resistance from germany et al. 
  you are essentially in a situation where you are walking into the woods at night completely unarmed and without any tools and just trusting that there are no wolves or bears . 
  from the same report : [ the next steps for european startups ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yhuhytk.png ), 
  if the 2007 financial crisis in the us is any indication , there is only one real response to the current situation in greece : `` prepare for unforeseen consequences . '', 
  economies are houses of cards that do n't react well to sudden changes , no matter how much planning you think you have done . 
  i swear to christ that becoming an economist has made my life infinitely worse now that i end up hearing ignorant crap like this all the time . 
  1 ) us inflation is near zero . 
  it 's actually too low right now . 
  2 ) the us dollar has gained strength against all currencies , especially the euro , this year . 
  3 ) the us does n't `` print '' dollars - that 's not how that works at all . 
  it 's not causing inflation , it 's not causing the dollar to be debased , and it worked to save the country 's financial system . 
  the proof is in the pudding - [ the us has had 63 straight months of private sector job growth ] ( http://www.dpcc.senate.gov/?p=blog&amp;id=172 ) , which is the longest streak in modern history . 
  how about you take a step back and acknowledge that the people who run the fed and the us treasury are way , * way * smarter than you appreciate , and that they actually do their job well ? 
   i would reverse the question `` what purpose did the bailouts serve ? '', 
  becasue to me little has changed and we only kicked the can down the road . 
  honestly in the us the bailouts of banks helped avoid a catastrophic liquidity crisis which would have plunged the country into a deep depression . 
  despite being unpopular , they were very necessary and the bailout money was repaid with interest , so the us government actually made money in the end . 
  as for europe and bailing out whole countries ... probably not a great idea . 
   i 'm sure your qe/low interest addicted , bubble filled economy will bounce back at some point .
