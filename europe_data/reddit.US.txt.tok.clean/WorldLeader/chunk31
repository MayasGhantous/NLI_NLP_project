  just remember - china is a country where the internet is heavily censored , you ca n't say anything about the '89 revolution , ip laws are a complete joke , state-sponsored companies routinely steal western manufacturing tech to reverse engineer , mobile execution vans are used for the death penalty , abortions can be forced on women , and the country is run by an unelected panel of billionaires . 
  but hey , if they sound like a good , common partner for development then by all means suck up to them . 
  [ got ta go even simpler !, 
  the new nato hq has a massive 245,000 square meters of office , conference , and recreational space . 
  the pentagon has over 600,000 square meters of indoor space . 
  it 's just a different level of massive . 
  if you read through the proposal a bit more , you 'll see that the context of these proposals is actually aimed more at countries like china which control domestic data and e-commerce very strictly . 
  by creating a clause in which all parties agree not to force companies to use their network infrastructure or mandate that they build data centers in their country , one could argue that businesses will be able to expand to new markets easier , and avoid censorship . 
  as with all things in life , there are pros and cons to any proposal . 
  this one is certainly a double edged sword . 
  the us though has an interest in avoiding any trade agreements which require us companies to build data centers in every country they operate in . 
  this is not only wasteful , but it also hurts smaller internet startups and perpetuates the power of google and microsoft , since they alone can afford to comply . 
  some garbage reporting via selectively copy/pasting the text . 
  here 's who is proposing 2.1 :  [ ca/tw/co / jp/mx/us propose : no party may prevent a service supplier of another party [ co/jp propose : or consumers of those suppliers , ] [ ca/co/jp / tw/us propose : from transferring , [ accessing , processing or storing ] information , including personal information , within or outside the party 's territory , where such activity is carried out in connection with the conduct of the service supplier 's business . ], 
  but hey , despite five other countries also proposing this , it 's the us alone that wants this clause . 
  here 's the rest of proposed 9.1 :  [ co/us propose : no party may require a service supplier , as a condition for supplying a service or investing in its territory , to :  * ( a ) use computing facilities located in the party 's territory ; * ( b ) use computer processing or storage services supplied from within the party 's territory ; or * ( c ) otherwise store or process data in its territory . ], 
   * however , nothing in paragraph 1 should prevent a party from conditioning the receipt or continue receipt of an advantage on compliance with the requirement to use , establish , or expand computing facilities in its territory , including those needed for the processing or storage of data . 
  * basically all the clause is saying is that you can not compel a company to use domestic computing facilities , but you can make their operation in your country contingent upon compliance with existing laws . 
  aka much different than this article is implying . 
  side note , after reading through the leaked document it was clear that the main parties actually debating these issues were the us/canada , korea/japan/hk / taiwan , and switzerland . 
  the eu did n't oppose any of the clauses that we are concerned about , nor did any of the states within the eu . 
  maybe instead of saying that the us is fighting europe on this issue , you should actually be saying hey wait , why is it that europe is turning a blind eye to all of this ? 
  i can assure you that nobody says `` race mixing is communism '' seriously . 
  lol, 
  to be fair , his username is actually from a popular song by the american band lcd soundsystem . 
  not surprising that you only know high skilled emigrants when you live in a developed country ... do you personally know people from afghanistan or bangladesh ? 
  the us has their high skill work visa , which is highly sought after . 
  this is n't the same thing as waiting years to become a citizen . 
  some wait nearly a decade . 
  no , the us averages 1 million immigrants per year and they are n't all high skill . 
  i actually know what i 'm talking about . 
  well the us accepts over a million immigrants per year , many from developing countries . 
  it 's the fairly narrow legal definition of refugee which keeps the number low . 
  coming from poverty in india does n't make you a refugee . 
  you have to be escaping a war zone or state discrimination basically . 
  well refugees are welcome , but it 's far harder for them to get here . 
  canada and mexico do n't really send many refugees , and it 's dangerous to travel through cartel territory to get to the us from central america . 
  except that picture is from over half a century ago . 
  people do n't say things like that anymore . 
  a total of 69,909 persons were admitted to the united states as refugees during 2013 ( see figure 1 ) . 
  the leading countries of nationality for refugees were iraq , burma , and bhutan . 
  ah okay no worries  it 's hard sometimes to tell here , haha, 
  but enough about the romans !, 
  african american is a term used to describe your race , not your nationality . 
  it 's just a pc term that 's falling out of favor in favor of just saying black . 
  well you heard it folks . 
  america will take all those pesky asian and persian scientists though ... uhg who needs them right ? 
  into the melting pot they go !, 
  also , black people are also welcome !, 
  we might shoot at you more often but at least you 'll be considered 100 % american , 
  probably because they are n't directly elected by the entire eu . 
  [ here 's the breakdown of how the regulation approval process works , courtesy of the op 's website . 
  ] ( https://www.savetheinternet.eu/img/nn_process_infographics.png ) as you can see , agreements must be formed by the parliament , council , and commission . 
  the parliament is elected , but the council is just the leaders of the member nations ( aka appointed by the majority party in the country that they reside if it 's a parliamentary system - key exception being a presidential system like france ) , and the commission is appointed by the parliament , so it 's a step removed from actual voters . 
  basically , you have a system where two of the three bodies in-charge of drafting new regulations are n't directly accountable to voters across the eu . 
  nobody is going to vote out their prime minister over an eu issue on the council , and i 'm not even sure how you 'd go about voting someone off the commission . 
  therefore , it 's clearly very easy for telecoms and large corps to come in and change some minds with some well-placed contributions . 
  not saying that the system is fatally flawed , and please do n't take this to mean that i 'm against the eu , but i do think that the proof is in the pudding . 
  if the eu can just reverse decisions from the parliament , despite majority public support , perhaps it 's time to reevaluate a bit . 
  you need to look at household income , not personal income . 
  you can have a household of one person , but often one spouse decides not to work full-time if their spouse makes enough . 
  therefore their personal income is very low , but they probably live well . 
  therefore your stats are incredibly misleading . 
   these are some contributing reasons to why your regular joe still ca n't afford the basics while working a minimum wage job full time . 
  the only people who are working minimum wage jobs are high-school kids and high-school dropouts . 
  even janitors make 20-40 an hour . 
  in fact , i think that the numbers speak for themselves ... 
  the table below lists the 34 oecd countries ' financial net wealth per adult in ppp . 
  the net average wealth is calculated by subtracting the debt from the mean wealth . 
  | country/territory | net financial wealth | | ------------------- | ---------------------- | | united states | 132,822 | | switzerland | 100,812 | | japan | 85,309 | | belgium | 78,368 | | netherlands | 71,063 | | canada | 63,261 | | united kingdom | 60,065 | | luxembourg | 57,159 | | israel | 55,932 | | sweden | 55,301 | | italy | 54,147 | | germany | 49,484 | | austria | 48,125 | | france | 47,668 | | iceland | 43,045 | | denmark | 39,951 | | australia | 38,482 | | portugal | 29,640 | | south korea | 28,290 | | ireland | 28,099 | | spain | 23,120 | | finland | 20,190 | | slovenia | 18,912 | | chile | 18,141 | | czech republic | 17,262 | | greece | 14,004 | | hungary | 13,652 | | mexico | 10,449 | | poland | 10,406 | | slovakia | 9,651 | | norway | 8,365 | | estonia | 7,843 | | new zealand | 7,480 | | turkey | 3,317 | edit : numbers do n't lie , but they make people buthurt . 
   the eu is a democratic system . 
  and if all your customers are unemployed ? 
  america : where refusing to work means that someone else will come take your job and do it instead . 
   interesting times sure are a coming in global currency markets and a gold backed yaun would do a lot to undermine confidence in a dollar that is being continually debased by one round of qe after another . 
  no disrespect , but you really do n't know anything about monetary policy if this is how you think that world currency works . 
  start here with fractional reserve banking : https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics/monetary-system-topic additionally , qe is over in the us . 
  the only thing left is zirp , but that 's going to likely end this year . 
  then the us is back into the realm of traditional monetary policy . 
  the whole point of having gold reserves is so that you can access them in the event of an emergency or military invasion . 
  aka so that the ussr/russia or whoever was n't able to flash invade and cart it off from berlin . 
  nobody is touching anything on american territory , and it 's really just a balance sheet number . 
  it seems a bit silly to care where the actual gold is stored so long as everyone agrees that it belongs to you . 
  hell , a polynesian tribe once used giant stones as their currency . 
  one time , in transit to another island , one of the large stones fell off the boat and into the harbor . 
  instead of considering the money lost , everyone just agreed that this guy still had the stone and could still pay for the items that he wanted . 
  everyone else subsequently adopted that stone when it was transferred to them . 
  the moral of the story is that no matter where your gold is , so long as everyone trusts that it exists you wo n't have any problems . 
  germany was acting irrationally when they asked for their gold back , and subsequently have been embarrassed since the us has been returning gold to them faster than they scheduled . 
  aka we had the gold just like we said , which makes the merkel administration look silly for buying into conspiracy theories . 
  that 's sort of like asking whether germany acts the same way as any other eu member from an economic standpoint . 
  technically they are an equal partner , but as we 've seen germany 's economic clout gives them more de facto power when it comes to setting policy . 
  given that the united states has an economy that 's roughly equal to the eurozone , it 's likely that in practice the us will hold more sway than individual european nations . 
  generally though , members of trade agreements are all equal in standing from a legal perspective . 
  washington dc 's average age is 33.0 years old , and i can assure you that there are far more politicians and lobbyists in dc proportionally than there are in berlin . 
  i 've never understood why more europeans do n't want to have actual freedom of speech . 
  it 's such a weird concept that you could be sentenced strictly for saying something on reddit . 
  edit : replies below reaffirm my stance . 
  you ca n't just take away people 's speech because they annoy you or because they `` might '' be terrorists . 
  fuck that 1984 bullshit . 
  that 's because the united states does not recognize the icc as a higher court than the american legal system .
