   japanese , ** american ** or chinese tourists will land in paris , get on a bus , go to their hotel , spend more time queuing than seeing stuff , take 200 pictures of the eiffel tower , and visit 15 museums ( 14 more than they 've visited in their entire lives ) , and then go back home .

  okay , that 's totally fair and i am fine if this is the tone people want to take . 
  would i circumcise my son ? 
  probably not . 
  but i think that a lot of americans would absolutely not compare it to child abuse . 
  that 's a very damaging word and implies the specific intent to harm your child knowingly , whereas all parents in the us would never want to hurt or harm their children . 
  you can spread awareness and that will help change attitudes , but saying that it 's barbaric mutilation or child abuse just polarizes the discussion and prevents cooler heads from prevailing . 
  personally i do n't lean strongly either way . 
  but after walking into this thread and having people compare it to fgm or rape it 's pretty hard to take the other arguments seriously . 
  look at the top comment in this thread . 
  it 's comparing people who do the procedure to `` bronze age cavemen '' . 
  how is that anything other than a personal attack ? 
  there 's no substance to that argument , yet it 's at the top . 
  that 's why i 'm complaining . 
  the main arguments that the majority of americans in this thread made are based on the scientific and medical community 's assessment of the pros and cons . 
  while i 'm fine with people leaving their boys uncut , banning the practice strikes most americans as a pretty narrow-minded reaction that does n't fully look at the medical positives to the procedure . 
  this is the strangest argument yet . 
  you seriously think that circumcision is a large profit driver for hospitals ? 
  how about you just admit that they 've come to a different conclusion than your country ? 
  nah this whole thread is people getting really defensive about being uncut . 
  the fact that post-circumcision you will never experience any complications , smegma , or actual problems with your foreskin ripping or worse at a point in your life when it would be extremely painful if why i think that they are n't considering the full pros and cons . 
  but hey , we 'll be downvoted soon enough . 
  well no shit , that 's why i come here - to experience other viewpoints . 
  apparently casual antisemitism and mocking other 's cultural heritage by making holocaust jokes is how you like to advertise your european way of life . 
  i 've lived in europe , have dozens of native born european friends . 
  they are all 100x more respectful and nuanced than the discussions occuring on this sub . 
  i 'm fine with being downvoted here , but that 's only because i think it 's important to share an alternative perspective on issues . 
  when you pretend like everyone here with an american flair must be a bible thumping lunatic from alabama , you miss the point entirely . 
  the point is crystal clear : the [ american society of pediatrics currently says that circumcision is beneficial for maintaining hygiene and reducing the transmission of diseases both to and from the male once sexually active . 
  ] ( http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/newborn-male-circumcision.aspx ) parents make decisions for their kids all the time - treating the health of their kid and taking professional recommendations seriously is part of being a good parent . 
  but hey , i 'm looking forward to the downvotes because that 's all this thread has become . 
  this whole fucking subreddit sucks . 
  what makes you more of an expert on medical facts than someone who has actually been studying and submitting peer-reviewed papers on the topic ? 
  oh right , it 's because you have an uncut dick . 
  thus you are an expert . 
   the std prevention is a already busted myth . 
  http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/malecircumcision/  sorry dude , thats some pretty short-sighted , obviously bias attitude you got there - one could argue that attitude originates in some kind of trauma , any idea what that could be ? 
   are you 12 ? 
   it 's even recommended by the top us pediatricians currently , although they are n't pushy about it . 
    they only do that because they are american . 
  ooh got those doctors there !, 
  i bet they also got their medical license from a church !, 
  yes , not having a pinky toe means you probably ca n't be an olympic athlete , but there have been plenty of `` cut '' males winning golds . 
  it 's a complete non-issue for daily life , for sex , and for anything in-between . 
  add in the fact that doctors are now back to recommending it to prevent utis and reduce the chance of spreading stds and you 'll see that it 's not clear-cut either way . 
  just a semantic difference at most - i know that it 's surgery , but it is outpatient and one of the most common surgery performed in the us . 
  i know that you want to make this a religious thing , but there are plenty of non-religious reasons for circumcision . 
  it 's even recommended by the top us pediatricians currently , although they are n't pushy about it . 
  parents just want to do what 's best for their kids , and if a doctor tells them that there are medical benefits to circumcision who are you to say that they are wrong ? 
   [ def : disfigurement or injury by removal or destruction of a conspicuous or essential part of the body . 
  ] ( http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mutilation ) your foreskin is neither conspicuous nor essential to your well-being . 
  these comments suck . 
  aesthetics , cleanliness , not being made fun of in middle school for having an `` anteater dick '' or something like that , etc. 
  in the us , it is pretty rare for white males to be uncut , so it can lead to a ton of anxiety growing up if you feel different . 
  and trust me , growing up we had a friend who had a french-born father and he was uncut , and we all thought it was super weird . 
  poor kid probably had a lot of anxiety over it , even though we were n't intentionally mean about it . 
  when you get older , it 's also helpful for reducing the spread of stds and preventing utis . 
  that makes no sense . 
  kidneys and circumcision are legitimate medical operations . 
  fgm is torture and is not a legitimate medical operation . 
  if the most important thing to you is how your dick looks , i do n't even know what to say . 
   it just says that the risks are minimal so no reason not to indulge the parents religious fanaticism . 
  circumcision in the us is almost entirely removed from religion . 
  most older males are circumcised and think that it is positive , and therefore they think that their sons should also be like that . 
  it 's not a religious decision at all . 
   however by making the distinction you enable people to make the argument `` well this mutilation is n't as bad as that one , so it 's totally ok '' . 
  i disagree . 
  i think that we need to take a step back and realize that circumcision is widely practiced in some cultures and is not meant to be a form of control or subjugation like fgm . 
  when you call circumcision `` mutilation '' you are putting it in the same category as fgm , which is what i 'm protesting . 
  when you call circumcision `` mutilation '' you are basically going to confuse and alienate the millions of men who are perfectly happy with their penis , and who do not consider it to be mutilation . 
  i 'll agree that going forward we should let the kid choose , but do keep in mind that some people do choose that route even after they grow older . 
  are you accusing them of mutilating their own penis ? 
  because there very , very big differences between what happens to girls and what happens to boys . 
  the fact that some men elect to be circumcised in adulthood , while literally no women elect to be subjected to fgm , should tell you something . 
  hospitals perform male circumcisions daily . 
  no western hospital has ever performed fgm - you would lose your medical license instantly . 
  they are n't comparable . 
  when you compare the two you degrade the fight against fgm . 
  the difference is that a licensed hospital anywhere in the world will perform circumcision if it is necessary , whereas no modern hospital will perform fgm for `` medical necessity '' . 
  that 's why it 's a bullshit argument . 
  it 's not a slippery slope . 
  fuck you for comparing the two . 
  nobody faces a lifetime of pain and inability to feel sexual pleasure from circumcision . 
  stop with these false comparisons . 
  edit : for the downvoters , actually read about fgm : ** http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/**  no health benefits , only harm fgm has no health benefits , and it harms girls and women in many ways . 
  it involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue , and interferes with the natural functions of girls ' and women 's bodies . 
   immediate complications can include severe pain , shock , haemorrhage ( bleeding ) , tetanus or sepsis ( bacterial infection ) , urine retention , open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue . 
   long-term consequences can include :  recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections ; cysts ; infertility ; an increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths ; the need for later surgeries . 
  for example , the fgm procedure that seals or narrows a vaginal opening ( type 3 above ) needs to be cut open later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth . 
  sometimes it is stitched again several times , including after childbirth , hence the woman goes through repeated opening and closing procedures , further increasing and repeated both immediate and long-term risks . 
  edit 2 : the reason i take this personally is because fgm is so barbaric and terrible . 
  absolutely deplorable in modern society . 
  when anyone points to it and says `` what about circumcision ?? '', 
  it detracts from the main issue and causes a ton of debate over a topic that should be perfectly clear . 
  ** when you bring fgm into the argument about circumcision , you only empower the assholes and culture who practice fgm . 
  ** that 's why i react strongly . 
  holy crap man it 's just your dick - stop thinking so much about what it `` could have been '' and worry about more important things . 
  this whole thread needs to chill the fuck out .
