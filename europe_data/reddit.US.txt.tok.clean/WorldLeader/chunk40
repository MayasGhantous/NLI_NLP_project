  the market may react positively to the news since greece no longer is causing imminent stability issues in the eurozone . 
  we do n't know yet . 
  buffet is talking politics here , not economics . 
  sure the crisis is n't limited to just germany vs greece , but the voters in germany wo n't support expanded bailout terms and thus the key nation in the system , germany , has the power to prevent future transfers if merkel believes that it will cost her an election . 
  remember , the difference between you and buffet 's analysis is that your prognostication has n't netted you billions and billions of dollars over a half-century of investing . 
  it 's pretty bold to claim that buffet is ill-informed or missing something - literally the smartest people in the world advise him . 
  they are supposedly creating the hk293 - which is the civilian variant of the g36 , but it uses different internal components due to export restrictions from the german government on selling `` weapons of war '' to civilian end users . 
  which is a silly distinction to make since you can easily buy the g3 in the us , which is unchanged from the military g3 , just without full auto . 
  obviously the design first came from the blended wing research that resulted in the b2 bomber in the 80s ( which in turn came from research carried out during the cold war and probably some crazy nazi prototypes ) , but i think that the first uav that had this type of delta-wing look was the [ lockheed martin polecat . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2c9v71brn8 ) they built it in 2005-06 . 
  the larger carrier-based drone is supposed to be flying armed missions in late 2015 , so it 's full-sized and not a tech demonstrator .

  the mq-9 is only in active service with the us , uk , and limited roles with italy . 
  france and the netherlands have started tests . 
  i think that you may be underestimating the power that religion had throughout most of british history . 
  sure , post wwi and wwii things changed , but prior to that people in general were far more religious . 
  to ignore the influence of the church is to intentionally ignore a key part of british history . 
  since you are ( i assume ) british , i definitely ca n't argue with your perception of england . 
  i 've lived there too for a while , but it 's not the same as being raised in the country . 
  i think that whether you are personally religious or not does n't necessary mean that your core values were not shaped in some way by religion . 
  most non-religious folks would say that their ideology is influenced by science and laws . 
  the foundation of british law can be traced back to precedents and cases that were originally decided by the church , not the state . 
  universities like oxford and cambridge underpinned the scientific revolution , and both of those institutions integrate the christian religion and philosophy into their curriculum . 
  i think that the vast majority of mps have been taught at an elite institution that incorporated religion at some point in their career . 
  i 'd compare it to being raised in india as a non-indian person . 
  even if you were a staunch atheist , you would still be influenced by many traditional aspects of buddhist , hindu , and sikh philosophy . 
  similarly in the uk , while you do n't believe in religion , you are still surrounded by christian influence . 
  i 'm a little confused - england 's state religion is anglican , via the church of england . 
  the head of state is the queen , and there are reserved seats for 26 of the most senior archbishops and bishops in the church in the house of lords . 
  while the uk does n't have an official religion , the `` british '' religion has always been some form of christianity . 
  islam is also an abrahamic religion , but has many differences from christianity . 
  therefore , it should n't be that surprising that islam is n't compatible with british values , since british values have historically been shaped for over a millennium by the church of england and catholicism , and are still somewhat officially represented in parliament . 
  [ here are 50 hyper-luxury residential towers over 700ft tall under construction/development in nyc ] ( http://www.6sqft.com/living-in-the-clouds-50-new-york-residential-towers-poised-to-scrape-the-sky-part-i/ ) [ here 's a rendering of nyc in 2018 ] ( http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/v2_article_large/public/2014/11/14/new-york-skyline.png ) but totally , none of the 1 % chooses to live and buy homes in the us . 
  you do realize that k-12 education is free in the us , right ? 
  that 's almost exactly how the us calculates unemployment . 
  the government body responsible for the number is the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ) - they calculate the rate for all states and territories . 
  here is their definition of what an unemployed person is :  people are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job , have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks , and are currently available for work . 
  actively looking for work may consist of any of the following activities :  contacting :  * an employer directly or having a job interview * a public or private employment agency * friends or relatives * a school or university employment center * submitting resumes or filling out applications * placing or answering job advertisements * checking union or professional registers * some other means of active job search  passive methods of job search do not have the potential to connect job seekers with potential employers and therefore do not qualify as active job search methods . 
  examples of passive methods include attending a job training program or course , or merely reading about job openings that are posted in newspapers or on the internet .

  ah , you are 100 % correct !, 
  thanks for showing me where countries are on the map . 
  i did n't realize that i had chosen the wrong comparison ... here are the real rates : * mississippi unemployment rate : 7.2 % * belgium unemployment rate : 8.5 % looks like the netherlands may be the closest based on the data . 
  well no us state is as bad as france - i have to be fair to mississippi . 
  they have the same unemployment rate . 
  and yeah those lakes are big , but i think it 's also the vector file being strange , haha, 
  [ belgium , the mississippi of europe  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/map_of_u.s._states_by_unemployment_rate.png ) edit : also , looks like the states with majority german immigrants are the lowest , haha . 
  ze german work ethic knows no boundaries !, 
  wait wait wait . . you needed a permit to build a dog house ?? 
  when i was growing up in the midwest us , i helped my grandpa build a huge addition to his house . 
  he drafted the design all by hand , we went to the lumber yard with a pickup and trailer , bought up all the wood and fasteners , and built it all ourselves over the course of a few weekends . 
  only thing that we contracted out was a cement truck to pour the slab , and bought pre-assembled roof trusses . 
  when it was all finished , we paid a plumber and electrician to wire it up , and then a county inspector came out to make sure that the wiring and supports were all good , and that was it !, 
  got ta say , the feeling of building your own house or deck or even just doing interior renovations feels great . 
  also , if you own enough land in the us , there is no such thing as not being allowed to fire guns or manage your property . 
  only things like dumping chemicals or burning garbage are regulated . 
  if you feel like moving here , let me know and i 'll personally take you to home depot and we can build you a luxury doghouse , 
  the only americans here are people who actively seek out discussions with europeans . 
  i live in a very , very educated part of the country . 
  we literally never talk about europe 's shortcomings because it 's not worth discussing . 
  it 's just not something that we think about , because it 's not important to us , does n't affect our economy , and honestly just is n't polite . 
  half the discussion in this thread is basically the equivalent of going to the gym and making fun of the largest guy there because he does all his workouts `` wrong '' . 
  guess what ? 
  if he 's happy with the results , then it 's not broken . 
  either way , it 's none of your business what workouts he does or does n't do . 
  that 's not a great measure of how easy it is to become wealthy though . 
  in the us , it 's much easier to start a company and there is more venture capital money available to make it big . 
  there 's a reason why lots of europeans move to the us to build their companies - flexible labor laws plus plentiful money is an attractive combo . 
  if i were trying to become a millionaire from scratch , i sure as hell would n't try to do it in germany or france . 
  go visit boston my friend . 
  god i love this country :'), 
  how do we know that this person yelling in the hospital did n't have a mental disorder ? 
  i 've literally never seen this before and i 've worked at a major us hospital . 
  that is the refreshing thing about american politics - we do n't blame other countries . 
  with that said , literally nothing else about american politics is refreshing . 
  cool , it sounds like you have no reason to move then . 
  i 'm from that part of the country too and trust me , everyone from my state refers to missouri as a southern state . 
  sure maybe if you live up by iowa or stl you 'll consider yourself midwestern , but the rest of your state is the south . 
  this is n't a reddit thing , this is a commonly-held belief by people who have never heard of reddit , and before them it was held by people who died before the internet was invented . 
  http://www.battleatcharleston.com/civil-war-map.png that 's the only map that matters - missouri was more closely aligned with the south , and more importantly fought against kansas becoming a free state during the prelude to the civil war . 
  it 's not just about geography , it 's about culture . 
  i do n't think that any midwest state would have a region called `` little dixie '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/little_dixie_ ( missouri )  while definitions of the counties included in little dixie vary , in 1860 the following seven counties were developed for plantations and their populations had proportions of slaves of 25 percent or more :  callaway boone howard county saline county chariton county lafayette county clay county . 
  the only other county of the state where the enslaved population was as high in 1860 was new madrid in the bootheel , a region devoted to cotton plantations in the floodplains along the mississippi river . 
  in 1847 , the state legislature passed a law prohibiting the education of any african americans , slave or free . 
  face it , your state definitely has a lot in common with the south , whether you want to admit it or not . 
  that said , kc gets a pass because it is a great place . 
  but most people separate the cities from the state . 
  i work with a number of estonians in the us tech sector . 
  let 's just say that there are very compelling reasons why they choose to live and work in the us . 
  take a look at the benefits list for a us tech company and you 'll probably change your attitude pretty quickly . 
  if you think that the only place in the us that pays high wages is nyc , you are n't paying attention . 
  boston , sf , dc , chicago , seattle , houston , san jose , la etc all pay very , very high wages for high-skill professionals . 
  quality of life also varies dramatically based on where you are - nyc is n't a great option for your needs but it also is not the only option by far . 
  i could write a paragraphs of information about how your views and idea of the us is wrong , but i 'll instead just say two words : your loss . 
  and also played an important role in stopping a genocide . 
  guess you got ta take the bad with the good eh ? 
  missouri is the south dude . 
  kc and stl are the exceptions , not the rule , and both border midwestern states . 
  head down to the ozarks and tell me that it 's the midwest .
