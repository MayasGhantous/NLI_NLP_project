  the air offensive was launched from 29 airbases in six european countries . 
  but only six european nations joined with the u.s. and canada to fly strikes against gaddafi 's forces . 
  the scale of the unpublicized u.s. role affirms hawks ' arguments : a divided nato simply could n't have waged the war it did without extensive american help . 
  what the hawks underestimated was the u.s. ability to operate without publicity -- in military lingo , beneath the radar .

  joe , tell these nice folks that they are confusing philipp r\u00f6sler with sigmar gabriel . 
  do you think that joe biden was privy to everything that dick cheney did as vice president ? 
  absolutely not . 
  my point is that he * was n't vice chancellor when this whole incident occurred * and therefore had to learn about it through briefing and from other civil servants . 
  he was n't in the government until six months later . 
  it 's really not that hard to understand . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  like , 90 % of diplomacy is conducted behind the scenes and wo n't be public record on purpose . 
  this allows people like ambassadors and diplomats to successfully communicate and manage relations with other countries without pissing off other countries . 
  if you do n't believe me , then where did the pressure come from on the american side ? 
  from an official memo ? 
  from a phone-call from the president ? 
  hell no , any pressure came via unrecorded conversations between diplomats and intel agencies . 
  so it 's incredibly unlikely that gabriel was privy to any of those discussions , and it 's equally unlikely that there is a paper-trail or recording of any of the conversations , so the only way that he knows this is via someone else telling him . 
  so once again , and feel free to downvote me if it makes you feel better , but i do * not * trust secondary sources when there is no one else corroborating the claim . 
  governments are n't going to air their backroom deals to members of opposition parties unnecessarily . 
  it 's probably likely that he was told that the us had an ultimatum , but since he was n't actually there he has no idea how that ultimatum was delivered nor whether there was cooperation from merkel 's end . 
  he only has second hand accounts , which means that we do n't actually know who originally made these claims . 
  i do n't know about you , but i prefer journalism that relies on primary sources . 
  edit : sigmar gabriel was n't in the government at the time of this event - philipp r\u00f6sler was the vice chancellor in june 2013 . 
  gabriel was running an opposition party , and definitely was not running germany 's foreign policy at the time . 
  did anyone actually read the whole article ? 
  this is a classic case of a reporter extrapolating based on one person 's statement . 
  fta :  in the case of germany , no government official has previously claimed that they were threatened by the u.s. as an excuse for turning their backs on snowden , whose disclosures helped germans as much as any population outside of the u.s. 
  okay , so here we see that nobody else within the german government raised this point . 
  additionally , the person making these claims , ** sigmar gabriel , was n't a part of the german governing coalition until six months after this incident . 
  ** snowden 's transit occurred in may and june 2013 , and gabriel did n't assume office until december . 
  it 's unlikely that he had any first-hand experience with this incident considering that he was the direct opposition to merkel at that time . 
   nonetheless , one of two things is true : 1 ) the u.s. actually threatened germany that it would refrain from notifying them of terrorist plots against german citizens and thus deliberately leave them vulnerable to violent attacks , or 2 ) some combination of high officials from the u.s. and/or german governments are invoking such fictitious threats in order to manipulate and scare the german public into believing that asylum for snowden will endanger their lives . 
  both are obviously noteworthy , though it 's hard to say which is worse . 
  i think point 2 ) is far more likely - the german government had to be complicit at some level , but merkel is probably not going to stop gabriel from spreading this rumor since it saves face for the german government . 
  i mean , he 's no louis armstrong ... 
  dude come on . 
  depleted . 
  really hard to compete with that . 
  not to mention that it has a gas turbine engine , which sounds badass . 
  the biggest thing with the abrams though is that it is battle tested . 
  therefore , it has been upgraded with the tusk i and ii system and the aim system so that it is ready for modern battlefields . 
  while some other tanks may be superior on paper , having a battle-tested tank and crew is important since you can work out the bugs . 
  if one country has a trade surplus , another country has to have a trade deficit . 
  that 's . . accounting 101 . 
  having too high of a trade surplus means that your country can only grow if other countries buy your goods , which leaves you vulnerable if your trading partners collapse . 
  both a high surplus or a high deficit are liabilities . 
  the rest of your post is classic straw grasping . 
  oddly enough , water cannon are completely off-limits in the us for police . 
  [ for very good historical reasons . 
  ] ( https://media.columbiamissourian.com/multimedia/2013/08/24/media/measuring_mlks_dream16_t_w600_h475.jpg ), 
   apart from that , your comparison with the usa is plain wrong . 
  within the usa you have bancruptcies of cities and potentially states , you have a complete shutdown of services wait , what ? 
  when did this happen ? 
  no states have declared bankruptcy , and cities ( i 'm assuming you are talking about detroit ) declare bankruptcy for reasons that span back decades , not just because of 2008 . 
  furthermore , the only thing that the `` government shutdown '' shut down was some national parks , museums , monuments , furloughed non-essential federal employees , and lots of workers got delayed paychecks . 
  for an ordinary american nothing changed for them . 
  i 'll give you the benefit of the doubt since you likely do n't live in the us , but there is a ton of hyperbole thrown around on / r/news and / r/worldnews about the us and the gop that really is n't very accurate . 
  and trust me , i 'm no fan of the gop . 
  wait , which vote are we talking about ? 
  i thought that we are talking in general terms here - i already contended that crimea was a sham election - that 's why i 've been using quotes around the word . 
  and yet south sudan held a general vote to secede from the republic of sudan in 2011 via the exact conditions described in my previous post , and under international law is viewed as a legitimate country . 
  i do find it fun to argue with people who think that they have it all figured out though , 
  [ the f-35 is actually pretty nifty . 
  you know , except for the ones jumping out of factory windows . 
  or getting cancer in polluted cities . 
  pretty sure aapl is the actual winner here . 
  the us domestic consumer buys more us goods than every other country in the world combined - the us is not export-dependent like many manufacturing countries like germany or china . 
  add to that the extremely high-tech sectors that manufacture optics , silicone processors , aircraft parts and other items that very , very few other countries can produce , and you have a fairly stable economy . 
  not to mention that 92 % of global trade involves the us dollar in at least one currency pair . 
  trade surpluses are n't necessary for a healthy economy , otherwise everyone would need to run one ( which is mathematically impossible ) . 
  by definition a government is established and exists only via the consent of its people , if you follow locke 's philosophy . 
  when a secession happens , people are n't voting to leave the land they live on or their culture/identity , they are specifically voting to leave their * government * . 
  therefore , the people vote to secede from their current government and unify with an alternative or existing government . 
  you can say that anytime a population votes to be governed by a higher authority , they are entrusting their rights to the new government . 
  when the people of crimea `` voted '' to secede from ukraine , they simultaneously voted to unify with russia . 
  it 's actually fairly clear if you think about it - you can not simultaneously be a part of two governments : the people have to secede from their current government ( thus dissolving or creating a civil rift ) before unifying with another . 
  but hey , you clearly knew this already because otherwise a `` retard '' is showing you up in civics class . 
   there wa no vote about that . 
  http://www.dw.de/the-vote-that-set-the-course-for-german-reunification/a-5364284  march 18 , 1990 , saw the first free elections to the east german parliament . 
  after its foundation 40 years earlier , the communist german democratic republic ( gdr ) for the first time gave its people the opportunity to express their opinions at the ballot box . 
  the result was overwhelming support for a quick road to reunification - and an end to east germany as a state . 
  time to learn your history my friend . 
  also , it 's pretty funny that you think that i 'm a `` putinbot '' despite having a 6 + year old account . 
  it 's the long con clearly . 
  ah yes , i 'm a putinbot . 
  you 've discovered me !, 
  also , if you really do n't think that there 's no such thing as a vote to join another country , go find someone from east germany and ask them about the reunification process . 
  `` legally '' the people of crimea held a vote and decided to join russia . 
  what everyone disputes is whether that election was legitimate . 
  you and i would say that it was obviously a sham , but to say that there is nothing to argue and that it is completely cut and dry is incorrect . 
  not to mention that crimea is n't historically ukrainian ... 
  i mean , i 'm definitely against putin 's current actions , but crimea was drunkenly traded ( allegedly ) from russia to ukraine within the ussr in the 50s , and tried to leave ukraine in the early 90s before the government in kiev cracked down and stopped the process to prevent them from leaving . 
  the transfer of crimea to ukraine was meant to serve as `` glue '' to bind russia with ukraine , and not necessarily as an acknowledgment that crimea belonged to ukraine . 
  to me it 's a very gray area . 
  i 'd rather see a solution to the troops in eastern ukraine instead of making crimea the main issue . 
  edit : seems like a pretty contentious issue - went from 15 upvotes to 10 down and back .
