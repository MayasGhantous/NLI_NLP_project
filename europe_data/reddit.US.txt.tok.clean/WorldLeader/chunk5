  being circumcised is n't the same thing as genital mutilation . 
  that cheapens the lifetime of pain and sexual struggle that women go through who have been subjected to fgm . 
  well , we * are * on / r/europe - there are definitely a higher amount of knee-jerk reactions here than most other subs , especially towards american policies . 
  i mean , [ germany has the exact same problems with coal mining ruining small towns ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/climate_desk/2014/04/coal_mines_swallow_towns_in_germany_why_solar_and_wind_haven_t_kicked_the.html ) but people wo n't post that sort of thing here . 
  honestly i 'm very surprised that the rates of cancer and defects are n't way higher . . coal mining has never been a safe job , and it 's always going to be dirty . 
  west virginia is one of the poorest states and those mountain towns are easily akin to a third world country in some areas . 
  the towns are dying out in the same way that farm towns are dying out - machines and lower labor needs means you can mine more with less people . 
  i 'm not an apologist for fossil fuels - i think that we need to move away from them - but life in general was much more dangerous 50 years ago when millions smoked without thinking it was bad for you , driving without seatbelts or airbags , throwing your sewage into the rivers untreated , etc. 
  our environmental standards have certainly risen . 
  probably not high enough for all industries , but the facts remain that until we replace carbon fuels with something cleaner , our way of life mandates that we burn energy . 
  might as well keep the energy coming from our borders in a cleaner manner than from a source that funds backwards monarchies or terrorism . 
   the us has forgotten that when you 're defending your way of life you do n't beat the enemy by becoming like them . 
  ah , that explains why i saw a bunch of guys stoning women in the park on the way to work !, 
  damn , we forgot that we do n't need to be the taliban . . do n't make the same mistake europe !, 
  while that does happen in certain parts of west virginia and pennsylvania , the vast majority of coal production is from open pit mines in the west , specifically wyoming . 
  [ source and charts ] ( http://www.eia.gov/beta/coal/data/browser/#/topic/33?agg=0,2,1&amp;rank=g&amp;geo=vvvvvvvvvvvvo&amp;mntp=g&amp;linechart=coal.production.tot-us-tot.a&amp;columnchart=coal.production.tot-us-tot.a&amp;map=coal.production.tot-us-tot.a&amp;freq=a&amp;start=2001&amp;end=2012&amp;ctype=map&amp;ltype=pin&amp;rtype=s&amp;maptype=1&amp;rse=0&amp;pin= ) as you can see , coal production in the us is actually declining in most states , specifically appalachia . 
  moreover , mountain top removal mining makes up less than 30 % of coal production in west virginia , and less than 3 % of total us coal production . 
  the current energy boom is due to natural gas and shale oil up by canada , plus better tech to reach reserves . 
  very few people are working in traditional `` coal mines '' like in the 70s , so save your hysterics . 
  also , while we `` all know '' that fracking is bad for the water table , can you please provide some evidence to backup your claims ? 
  burden of proof is on you when you are telling people that people 's faucets are catching on fire and everyone is dying of lung cancer . 
  you ... only file taxes on income earned abroad over 95,100 usd . 
  anything under that amount is not taxable in the us . 
  basically it 's setup to keep super rich people from evading taxes . 
  it is n't perfect , but you can ask france how well it 's going to let rich people simply move to another country and keep their citizenship without paying taxes . 
  [ historically , the united states has presided over the most peaceful period in human history , and things have only become more peaceful after the fall of the soviet union . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lyiyzq1.jpg ) but hey , if you fear the us then nothing i can say will change your mind . 
  or you can move to the us !, 
  the wage mean is 2870 $ ( converted ) in the us ( higher than any european country besides switzerland , denmark and norway ) and unlike those three countries everything is relatively cheap in the us !, 
  especially food and clothes . 
  [ come join the partay !!, 
  technically the us is growing faster than the uk this quarter , but your point is still valid for europe . 
  the uk and the us have a similar view on labor rules and have pursued aggressive monetary policies , and it looks like it is paying off vs the more conservative policies in mainland europe . 
  the winner would obviously be cambridge , massachusetts . 
  harvard - 153 mit - 83 population of cambridge : 107,289 ( 9.32 ) ** nobel laureates per million people : 2,200 ** wicked smaht, 
  do n't blame obama - he did n't want it . 
  i blame the weirdos on the committee who thought it was a good idea . 
  okay ... the us benefits by `` getting out of a recession '' , the uk benefit by remaining a sovereign nation . 
  sure the us comes out ahead , but you definitely are n't considering the alternative scenario where the us does n't send any aid at all . 
  there are plenty of things for brits to complain about , but america 's involvement in wwii should be one of the absolute last things that you choose to criticize . 
  when eisenhower privately threatened to destroy the pound during the suez crisis , the uk lost its superpower status for good . 
  the us and the uk keep up very close diplomatic relations because it is mutually beneficial , but as eisenhower proved this is a show ultimately run by the americans . 
  that said , saying that the us forced the uk into anything is incorrect . 
  the us policy towards asking for coalition support from the uk has never been based around threats . 
  if the uk does something to undermine american interests ( aka the suez crisis ) then the us wo n't hesitate to force them out , but that is different than having the uk join the coalition in iraq or afghanistan . 
  so the uk and the us do stand shoulder to shoulder on issues that we agree on . 
  most american policy makers absolutely value the support and input of their british contemporaries . 
  but the difference is that the us has the ability to act unilaterally against the uk 's wishes whereas the uk does not really have the ability to go against the us 's . 
  it 's a pretty trivial difference in reality , since the us and the uk almost never disagree publicly . 
  i 've lived in both nyc and chicago - nyc has the edge but not be a ton . 
  chicago is an incomparable world-class city , and has a lifetime worth of things to do . 
  i 've been to zurich and spent quite some time exploring , and it 's cool , but does n't have near the type of cultural or nightlife or beating heart that chicago has . 
  look , i understand that zurich is nice . 
  it 's pretty , and quiet and full of rich people . 
  but compare : [ zurich ] ( http://travelioo.com/img/zurich-photo1.jpg ) [ chicago ] ( http://blog.zealousgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/chicago-nighttime.jpg ) [ not to mention casual million people coming out to the park ] ( http://blog.masslive.com/breakingnews/2008/11/large_110408obama-grantpark-480.jpg ) whatever , i 'm just annoyed . 
  go visit chicago before you die and i think you 'll see what i mean . 
  huh , i guess i did n't realize that it was actually illegal in most of europe . 
  i can see both points of view though of course , and each interpretation has its merits . 
  why would either example be illegal ? 
  you can say whatever you want in my book , so long as you are n't specifically targeting a person ( like going up to someone and telling them that you are going to kill them ) since that 's assault . 
  expressing your views on general issues ( god hates fags , infidels will burn in hell , muslims should be deported , vegetarians are heathens , women suck , xbox is literally hitler , etc ) should n't be illegal in my opinion . 
  * ahem * [ some smart folks were saying this same thing a while ago ... ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ngbikmhgwla/tbdpvqiztoi/aaaaaaaaadw/ajdcbdton4e/s1600/joindie.jpg ), 
  lol like we give a shit about what other countries think of us . 
  how else do you explain the past ... 8 decades ? 
   but i still understand the logic of docking points for not having a good public transport system . 
  a car should be a luxury , not a necessity . 
  nyc has the best public transport in the us , of course it figures higher than the rest . 
  also , the international connectivity in nyc is much higher than most of the us . 
  but chicago also has a very good , 24 hours a day transit system !, 
  have you been to chicago ? 
  [ subway ] ( http://www.metrowalkz.com/images/chicago/ctamaptrain.gif ) [ local rail ] ( http://www.mappery.com/maps/chicago-metra-map.mediumthumb.gif ) there are two international airports that also serve the city and are on 24 hour subway lines , [ meaning that you do n't need a car ever to get straight into the terminal . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/cta_blue_line_o'hare.jpg ) i lived in chicago and never had any need for a car . 
  there are tons of cycle tracks and the local buses cover all gaps that the l does n't hit . 
  it 's close to nyc in terms of coverage , so that 's why i do n't understand this ranking at all /, 
  i did , and i do n't think that they calculated them correctly accounting for the different types of living infrastructure . 
  if we are judging all cities by the ease of living without a car , then this list makes sense . 
  but in the us cars are very cheap , gas is very cheap , quality of life is high since food is cheap , maintaining your home is cheap and diy is very popular , etc. 
  plus , it still does n't explain the massive gap between nyc and other cities with developed mass transit and international transit infrastructure like chicago , dc and boston . 
  i know it 's going to sound like sour grapes but how the hell does a city like [ chicago ] ( http://ideasinspiringinnovation.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/chicago_lincoln-park-9.jpg ) score 20 places lower than zurich ? 
  i 've been to zurich and explored quite a bit . 
  it is very pretty , but it is very , very expensive , the housing stock is n't as diverse or modern as compared to [ chicago ] ( http://www.contemporist.com/photos/at_241109_05.jpg ) , chicago 's lake is bigger , chicago has it 's own cuisine and massively diverse culinary culture , far bigger museums , over 60 miles of bike and walking trails just along the lake , surrounded by an unbroken chain of parks , millions of citizens from diasporas , over 120 languages spoken , largest futures exchange , hq for major f500 companies , much cheaper to live than nyc or sf , etc. 
  i just do n't buy that zurich is supposedly 20 spots better than chicago . 
  i feel like this study under-ranked us cities though . 
  nyc is obviously top up there , but the other major cities were weirdly placed . 
  here are a few examples : 18 - copenhagen 20 - los angeles 22 - vancouver 24 - washington dc 29 - bangkok 30 - boston 31 - chicago 32 - san francisco like , what are those cities down that far down the list ? 
  also , why are the next 5 biggest us cities so far behind nyc ? 
  rankings like liveability should not be massively higher for nyc than for chicago or san francisco , and why the cities of boston , chicago , sf , dc , and la are all behind stockholm , frankfurt , toronto and madrid does n't quite square with reality . 
  obviously the answer is that they weighted the results in a certain way , but it 's still silly to rank the livability of nyc far higher than any other us city when it 's arguably the most expensive ( rent , food , entertainment ) city in the us . 
  basically , this study says that only one city in the largest economy by far in the world belongs within the top 20 global cities , while 10 cities in europe ( combining for a similar economic size ) make it into the top 20 . 
  i think that this list is a better representation of cities : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_city#global_cities_index, 
  you do n't make insane amounts of money at bain by being wrong . 
  the issue is that he had to compromise waaay too much to the extreme right in order to get elected . 
  had to act like a good ol folksy person in those inane town hall meetings in iowa . 
  truth is that romney probably disdained them all and wished he could just have an intelligent conversation . 
  unfortunately that 's not how popular politics work in the us . 
   the human body is not a black body . 
  check your white privilege shitlord !, 
  i can only speak for some americans , but most people have n't been to france , and if they have they 've only been to paris . 
  it 's super easy to make stereotypes out of parisians , and since there is relatively little english-language french press and news , most people do n't know much about modern france . 
  obviously france is a very large and powerful country , and many of the french people i know working here in the states are awesome and very sharp .
