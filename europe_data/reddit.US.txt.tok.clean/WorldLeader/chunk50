  they also sued everyone under the sun for reparations for the families - pulled in well over 100 million . 
  also the nightclub was over the legal capacity and did n't comply with the existing safety laws that would have prevented the disaster had they been followed . 
  looks like they are perfectly fine dishing out criticism towards the us , but when the us correctly criticises the media suppression in hungary it 's unfair and intrusive ? 
  suck it up crybabies . 
  while there are some valid complaints about business schools in this rant , hbs is a world-class institution and most of the students there are very intelligent , hard-working people from all across the career spectrum . 
  it 's nearly impossible to get admitted . 
  additionally , hbr is a well respected publication . 
  this is n't necessarily just some kids writing term papers , it 's edited and verified in accordance to hbrs editorial and research standards . 
  if you do n't like the conclusion that 's fine , but attacking the institution seems unnecessary . 
  interesting . 
  i 've been to all of those countries in europe except croatia , but i 've also lived in larger american cities like chicago , dc and boston . 
  i like europe a lot and would probably live there for a year or two if i could get paid anything near what i make here , but i think that northern american cities offer a ton of opportunity if you are getting bored of the south . 
   americans have a very strong attitude of `` mind your own fucking business '' . 
  it 's a big part of why it 's easy for people to move here and integrate , because at the end of the day nobody gives a shit , get a dog , get a house , get a car , go to work . 
  i would say that in addition to this , there is a ton of respect for people that do their job . 
  [ i know that this is american football , but this video short does an amazing job of capturing the sort of idea behind everyone executing and taking joy in `` doing their job '' , regardless of who they are and whether they are a veteran or a rookie .

  out of curiosity , where in europe have you visited , and where in the us have you lived ?

  i honestly do n't know if you are trolling . 
  you do n't need to have people of other races in your society to be racist . 
  if your country is 100 % the same race , that does n't automatically mean that those people think that all races are equal . 
  and even if you are n't racist , wanting to keep your country `` homogeneous '' is pretty much the definition of xenophobia , which when applied to arabs and refugees from syria/balkins/yemen takes on a racial undertone . 
  perhaps your conscience is clear , but you come across as saying that you prefer to keep your country `` pure '' and not have other foreigners mess it up . 
  oh right , because you were totally talking about conflict between nations in your first post . 
  that `` homogeneous '' national culture . 
  give me a break - i just call out racism when i see it . 
  seriously , what the fuck ? 
  your society was a utter warzone for most of its modern history , completely destroyed during wwii , crawled out only to be subjugated by the ussr for half a century during which a huge percentage of your educated , political population fled west or were jailed/killed , had a revolutionary movement suppressed for a generation until the fall of the soviet union , and has since been steadily rebuilding upon the ashes . 
  and that 's within people 's current lifetimes . 
  so ignoring that all of that catastrophic damage was visited upon you by nearly identical white , christian , northern europeans , you can only really say that you 've been living in a `` conflict free '' society for the past two decades . 
  not sure why you 'd ever want that to happen ... saudi arabia would nuke anyone that tried that . 
  they have an implicit agreement to buy warheads from pakistan in the event that they 'd ever need one . 
  nuclear war is n't really ideal . 
  secondly , it would start off a crazy nuclear/chemical arms race within every country out there that has natural resources , since apparently some super-national body will come and take it from them otherwise . 
  1 ) `` black american '' are not immigrants , they were literally brought here against their will be both european and later american companies . 
  2 ) until after the civil war , black americans were not citizens nation-wide , and were counted as property throughout the south . 
  3 ) until the civil rights movement in the 1960s , black americans had almost no ability to vote or influence politics . 
  they were not represented by any major national politician or congressman . 
  for a black girl to even go to school with white kids [ required the us marshals to march her into class ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/gpwvg85nuas/maxresdefault.jpg ) , which was empty because all of the white parents pulled their kids out of that school . 
  4 ) despite all of these enormous hurdles , black americans have a fundamental place in american culture , from sports to entertainment to fashion to music . 
  demographically they lag behind other races in america , but they are absolutely a part of the american fabric in a way that no immigrant group in europe could ever dream . 
  5 ) more black americans ( 14 ) have been to space than total citizens of any country in europe . 
  more black * female * americans have been to space than total citizens of scandinavia have been to space . 
  i just find that pretty amusing . 
  which is why i 'm surrounded by smart french professionals here in the states . 
  french companies do a lot of their research outside of france where the talent pool is deeper and more competitive . 
  classic mistake not going directly for the shoulder massage . 
  vermont is n't a real state . 
  got ta disagree with you there - too many wedge issues to keep any real republicans away from sanders . 
  if they vote for him , they were n't really a conservative ( not that it 's a bad thing ) . 
  best thing to do is ignore / r/politics when trying to figure out american politics . 
  hillary did best at the debate on tuesday , and sanders fans are panicking so they 've been spamming non-stop . 
  he honestly did n't look very presidential , and was caught looking like an old man on a number of questions . 
  hillary came off surprisingly likable . 
  not really , bernie has stagnated in the last few months and the hillary votes have fallen due to pollsters including the current vice-president biden into the possible choices , but he has n't declared and is likely not running . 
  so once he steps out for good , a sizable chunk will go back to hillary . 
  fox breaking news is fine . 
  local fox affiliates are great . 
  right-wing entertainment and opinion shows are 90 % of what people freak about about here . 
  it 's cable television , not the new york times . 
  the us : the country that allowed germany , france , italy , sweden , the uk , japan , korea , and anyone else to sell their cars , trains , and planes into the us marketplace without any barriers post-wwii ? 
  it is an odd problem to hear about from my admittedly american perspective . 
  assaulting any cop is a good way to find yourself in a world of hurt , if not dead . 
  hardly . 
  if you are upset , vote with your wallet and your feet . 
  complaining about american `` dominance '' of any industry while contributing directly to that industry seems like a silly thing to do . 
  it 's like complaining about mcdonalds being a bad company while continuing to eat there daily . 
  * posted to an american site , sent from my american os *, 
  the us has an enormous and thriving internet services economy that has been pioneering ecommerce and services for decades . 
  the level of us data protection is balanced so that it does n't stifle entrants into the market with tons of red tape . 
  europe wants to pass these laws and that 's fine , but it ends up hurting hundreds of tiny internet companies that do not have the resources to comply with the regulations on data retention and storage . 
  from a consumer perspective , your data is a bit safer . 
  from a business perspective , you move to the us to start your company . 
  which is why i work in a big tech hub here in the states surrounded by tons of people speaking french , german , danish , etc. 
  because that 's the explicit job of the cia ? 
  recruit and deploy assets in foreign territory to achieve national objectives ? 
  * they are a spy agency * ... why is this surprising to anyone ?? 
  you do realize that puerto rico is quite a bit richer per capita than greece , right ? 
  28.5 k vs 21.9 k usd per capita . 
  greece is what you should be worried about . 
  the imf is headquartered in washington dc , and is at its core a product of the `` american consensus '' post wwii . 
  so , yes , america sees it the situation in a similar light as the imf . 
  this is the sort of thing that europe will try to push on the us if ttip is allowed to pass !, 
  i do n't want hazardous amounts of nox in my american city just because european car makers can strong-arm the eu . 
  standard household outlets in the us are 120v @ 20amp @ 60hz . 
  we live dangerously with our high amperage outlets , haha, 
  i love dunks , but they never feel the same outside of the northeast united states . 
  you need all of those cops to have a thick boston accent to make it authentic !, 
  and throw a bunch of union construction workers into the mix too . 
  final step is to order your iced coffee and [ get it served like this so that you can drink it during the winter !, 
  in one case your phone is slightly slower than claimed when being evaluated by independent websites and benchmark tests . 
  in the other case your tiny commuter car unbeknownst to you pollutes 2x as much as a chevy suburban and was specifically designed to defraud the us government 's environmental protection agency . 
  i 'll let you decide which is worse . 
  [ for reference , this is 110,000 people watching college kids play a game ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/michigan_stadium_2011.jpg ) [ this is 160,000 people watching drivers turn left for 500 miles . 
  ] ( http://powershopperblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/76329085_101.jpg ), 
  if you are feeling slighted , perhaps ask why america is n't taking you seriously anymore . 
  democracies are n't `` friends '' with each other - they are the sum of their citizens first and foremost , so if everyone in america wants to go fuck up the middle east there 's nothing that france can do to stop it . 
  it 's called realism .
