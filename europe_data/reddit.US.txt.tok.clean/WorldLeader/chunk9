  additionally , i do n't really understand why you are trying to scale the volumes based on gdp . 
  they are not state-owned , and therefore gdp is irrelevant to a company . 
  all this tells me is that france is much more reliant on arms sales as a percentage of their gdp than the us . 
  airbnb is also a good option in big cities . 
  there are also lots of camp sites if you want to bring a tent !, 
   this makes europe a far more interesting place than the relative uniformity of the united states . 
  this is n't meant to be an accusation , but have you been to the us before ? 
   if the us would lose its position as a leading economy in the world , the whole edifice will crumble immediatly . 
  well unemployment is at 6.1 % and falling , and our last quarter gdp growth was better than * china * , so i do n't think that 's a likely scenario . 
  what massive financial problems is the us facing ? 
  equity markets have erased all losses from the recession , banks have more or less removed most toxic assets from their balance sheets ( thanks to the fed ) and new legislation has done a modest amount to limit the type of rampant speculation that happened in 2007 . 
  my question to you is what has europe done to get their fiscal house in shape since 2008/2010 ? 
  a triple dip recession is looking increasingly likely and yet there are not many new ideas . 
  first off , do n't lump kansas in with the deep south . 
  secondly , kansas has [ very good roads ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ieb8vnfsijs/tdoci4lp_1i/aaaaaaaac9a/fvyqf72s6he/s1600/2010-6-15-11+kansas+road+scene+west+on+i-70+from+abilene.jpg ) , [ good education system ] ( http://www.pgavarchitects.com/images/sized/images/expertise/bvn-7-580x380.jpg ) , [ overall good communities ] ( http://www.k-state.com/s/1173/images/editor/programs__and__events/homecoming/2013/201210261531045__zf-5971-06656-1-045_.jpg ) and profitable industries like [ aircraft manufacturing in wichita ] ( http://brentdanley.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/bas-wichita.jpg ) and [ farming ] ( http://www.kswheat.com/photogallery/l/14.jpg ) . 
  it also has good local and regional hospitals and state universities . 
  sure the past few years have seen some stupid people take power in topeka , but historically it has ranked in the top third of states for these metrics . 
  public transit does n't make economic sense in kansas due to the distance between cities . 
  some have buses , but there is n't a lot of ridership that would happen between cities . 
  also , did i mention the size ? 
  https://mapfight.appspot.com/us.ks-vs-de/kansas-us-germany-size-comparison kansas has 2.9 million people total . 
  there is n't a huge tax base period . 
  i hold degrees in economics , international finance and work for an international consulting firm managing supply chains for companies worldwide . 
  hell i just comment here for fun during my coffee breaks . 
  sure i 'm going to be a bit biased on some topics , but the facts are that global business is a very fluid environment , and writing off the us as an investment opportunity is foolish . 
  in 2008 , the us was not an investment opportunity . 
  [ this quarter though , it is the fastest growing developed economy . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/gdp-growth-rate ) your advice and strategy should not be based on biases , but rather on actual indicators . 
  i do n't read the wsj either , but that is because they have a political bias towards the republican party , and therefore want to under-report good economic news to hinder the obama presidency . 
  they 've constantly been predicting that the economy will collapse or that the sky is falling or to buy gold/silver . 
  meanwhile , the best analysis is the one that can change based on new information . 
  do n't be afraid to change your mind sometimes . 
   he also was completely deluded about the us and canada and how they are lands of opportunity that welcome competition and are great for smaller companies . 
  they are n't . 
  your company would be immediately killed by entry barriers and the terrible business environment there , the majors would destroy you and your business model . 
  yikes , the irony of accusing someone of being brainwashed and then spitting out this nonsense is rich . 
  the us has tens of thousands of startups and entrepreneurs that are n't immediately swallowed up by competition . 
  perhaps it 's not the best place in the world , but i 'm not sure that your advice was correct . 
  perhaps do a bit of introspection before you write off the world 's largest and richest economy as `` a terrible place to do business '' . 
  specifically : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldzx4oorsws it 's actually a hilarious music video !, 
  statistically , the us has a higher percentage of adults with a tertiary degree than any european country . 
  population with tertiary education : 42.5 %  average annual growth rate ( 2000-2011 ) : 1.4 % ( the least )  education expenditure as pct . 
  of gdp : 7.3 % ( 6th highest ) the us is behind israel , japan , canada , and russia in this regard . 
  [ source ] ( http://247wallst.com/special-report/2013/10/15/the-most-educated-countries-in-the-world-2 ) now obviously degrees do n't necessarily make you intelligent , but i do think you 'd be surprised at the number of `` smart '' people you will meet in the us . 
   the war in libya may be one of those quietly telling moments in the history of more important nations . 
  for the first time , the united states has taken a secondary role -- `` leading from behind , '' if `` leading '' is even the right word -- in a war prosecuted by the nato alliance and driven by britain and france , the two strongest military powers in europe . 
   but oh what a war !, 
  more than six budget-busting months against one of the weakest militaries in the world , with shortages of planes , weapons and ammunition that were patched over by the pretense that nato was acting simply to `` protect civilians , '' when it was clear to everyone that the alliance was intervening on one side of a civil war . 
  all resemblances to the kosovo war , of course , are a priori inadmissible . 
  that was the war -- 78 days of bombing serbia and thousands dead before slobodan milosevic finally capitulated -- when nato said : `` such a success , never again ! '' yet here we are -- with the `` responsibility to protect '' the new mantra , replacing kosovo 's `` humanitarian intervention . '' both are debatable , given the failure to intervene in the separatist russian republic of chechnya then and syria , bahrain or yemen now . 
   libya has been a war in which some of the atlantic alliance 's mightiest members did not participate , or did not participate with combat aircraft , like spain and turkey . 
  it has been a war where the danes and norwegians did an extraordinary number of the combat sorties , given their size . 
  their planes and pilots became exhausted , as the french finally pulled back their sole nuclear-powered aircraft carrier for overdue repairs and italy withdrew its aircraft carrier to save money . 
   only eight of the 28 allies engaged in combat , and most ran out of ammunition , having to buy , at cost , ammunition stockpiled by the united states . 
  germany refused to take part , even in setting up a no-fly zone . 
   although washington took a back seat in the war , which the obama administration looked at skeptically from the start , the united states still ran the initial stages , in particular the destruction of libya 's air defenses , making it safe for its nato colleagues to fly . 
  the united states then provided intelligence , refueling and more precision bombing than paris or london want to acknowledge . 
  inevitably , then , nato air power and technology , combined with british , french and qatari `` trainers '' working `` secretly '' with the rebels on the ground , have defeated the forces , some of them mercenary , of col. muammar el-qaddafi . 
   the question , however , is whether european members of nato will ever decide to embark on such an adventure again . 
   either europeans will develop the security and defense identity they have advertised for so long , so europe can have its own credible voice in a world not only run by soft power , or given the expense and difficulties of defeating even libya , they will simply stop trying . 
  the jury is out , but the verdict is important . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/sunday-review/what-libyas-lessons-mean-for-nato.html?pagewanted=all basically , european defense priorities are confused and your capabilities are way too weak to defend against an actual territorial threat . 
  that 's why the us sticks around . 
  you should watch this documentary : http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/ it 's a very objective look at the intelligence community post-9 .11 . 
  you will come away with a better understanding of the issues and why people reacted the way that they did . 
   spare the apology , i do n't want it . 
  i want the spying to stop without any explanations why that wo n't be the case . 
  i do n't care about american paranoia when it 's violating my and millions of others rights . 
  and i want to live on mars . 
  no , we spend that money to keep your continent out of war with russia , and therefore able to grow economically and trade with the us . 
  we also spend that money because europe is one of the largest beacons of democratic ideals , and we want to ensure that it does n't fall to autocrats like putin and formerly to the ussr . 
  of course we spend money if it is our interest , but a stable and peaceful world is not just in the us 's interest , it is in europe 's interest as well . 
  we just ask that our allies pay their fair share , which is n't too much to ask in my opinion . 
  look , i agree with you that spying on people en mass should n't be the way that the us intel departments work , but you have to understand the complete overhaul after 9.11 dictated that new techniques be used . 
  it was the darkest hour for us intelligence when nobody had any answers on where those attacks came from , even with a ton of evidence that would be easily caught today . 
  fear created the current system , and in the minds of americans our safety comes before your comfort . 
  i really am sorry about that , and it does certainly suck for everyone involved . 
  i wish that more americans felt like you . 
  however , your country has not been targeted the way that the us , the uk , or even spain has been targeted , and thus you have the privileged of taking a slightly more rational approach to the subject . 
  the final thing is that , politically , us politicians will never be voted out of office for making americans `` safer '' at the expense of non-americans . 
  that 's just how our politics work . 
  call it tribalism or nationalism or whatever you want , but until that attitude changes there is n't much that is going to change . 
   do you even know what the nato is and how/why it was created ? 
  to quote a famous statesman , nato was created to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down . 
  the nsa is supposed to spy on foreign countries - that 's the entire point of the agency . 
  if they are spying on germans then they are just doing their job . 
  there 's no boundaries in real-life international espionage . 
  what the nsa is not supposed to do is spy on american citizens . 
  that 's only supposed to happen via a proper police warrant via the fbi or law enforcement , not the federal intelligence agencies . 
  so yes , they were upset at the nsa for spying on americans because that is illegal . 
  they were not upset at the nsa for spying on germans because that is their job . 
  also , us debt is dollar-denominated , which means that there is no default risk ( barring stupid shit from congress ) . 
  the uk is also fairly safe there . 
  euro countries though are not . 
  wow , what a bunch of moochers you guys are . 
  the us spends hundreds of billions maintaining the only credible deterrent your continent has - a guaranteed second-strike nuclear capability - and all you can say in thanks is `` we should save money by cutting our own military budget '' . 
  fuck that attitude - pay your fair share . 
  just because i think it 's interesting to compare : http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/map_csp_us_june_may2004.jpg to harmonize the scales , keep in mind that 1000 on the first scale is roughly 2.7 on this scale , and the top of the first scale is about 6 on this scale . 
  latitude makes a big difference . 
  it 's amazing that europe has been able to set aggressive solar targets while not have n't nearly as much sunlight to work with .
