i 'd give you the vanguard of the russian force is comparable to any modern western military , but the rest of the force is ill-equipped and unprepared given the modernization program has n't had time to be fully implemented . 
  i do n't want to emulate no * `` kick in the front door and the whole house will come collapsing down '' * , but the point is , they 're * nowhere near * as ready & prepared as they were at the height of the soviet union . 
  it looks like the war 's already started in europe . 
  you 're right . 
  hard to get mad cow disease when you 're eatin ' horse meat . 
  so sure , that 's one way to look at it . 
  and if you think you 'll hurt , think about china . 
  they 're not like us , they need to keep ** extreme/large ** growth to keep growing . 
  they ca n't just * `` scrape by '' * or , fuck , god-forbid go into * `` recession '' * . 
  their entire long-term strategy , their very society , depends on that extreme growth given china 's huge population and fast-track attempts to conjure a middle class . 
  the last recession cut half their growth and they hurt like a motha ' fucka . 
  imagine what stagnant/small growth , or like i said above , recession would do to them * ( i 'd even argue moderate growth would do the same , but i wo n't for this here ) * . 
  they would completely collapse ; worse than either of us . 
  i mean , look at europe . 
  america left the recession around 2009 , the european union did too , but then had a double-dip as you very well know and did n't exit * that * until last august . 
  and even now your growth is stagnant even in comparison to america 's moderate growth ; unemployment is much higher as well , but i understand well that can be disputed and do n't argue against that disputation . 
   you will get back on trees . 
  do n't really understand this one . 
  can you explain ? 
  eh , that 's very true , but i think we should still help in some way . 
  i mean , i definitely get what your sayin ' , and you 're completely right , an i 'm not tryin ' to suggest we invade ukraine or anything over it , but you know ... some kind of assistance ... send in the cia or some shit ... they could use a morally righteous mission for fuckin ' once ... 
  eh , it could be strongly argued that the eu could 've responded to the crisis much more efficiently & effectively had it actually integrated more and gave their currency union a stronger foundation . 
  some may argue that their national governments could 've responded better given they were n't tied down by eu redtape and a constant fight between eu-national sovereignty . 
  [ it 's not working ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_gypsies ) . 
  we just turned it into reality television like everythin ' fuckin ' else in this coutnry . 
   only americans care about those things because they are fucking uneducated idiot redneck farmers . 
  holy fuck i 've never met somebody with a better understanding of americans . 
  where did you get your degree in americanology ? 
  because fuck , going off your other comments here , you really could n't be ** more spot-on ** . 
  it 's weird ... because like i said ... those * `` improved '' * regulations could n't tell if beef was horse until it had spread through-out the entire market ... 
  so . . you 're telling me ... that we ca n't fail because if we do the world wo n't get paid ? 
  what , you think china wants to find out the guy who 's holdin ' most of their money is about to default and ca n't afford to pay them back ? 
  what about european countries with significant ammounts invested in u.s. treasury bonds ? 
  on top of that , you think that they want a usd collapse ? 
  a hyper-inflated usd ? 
  so they get back only a fraction of the value they invested ? 
  * lulz *, 
  that is very , very true . 
  but i would contend ya 'll are closer to us than you are to the british , let alone europeans in general . 
  especially in regards to states in the border region ; specifically maine , vermont , washington & oregon . 
  yeah , and overall , the united kingdom killed around 50x as many people with mad cow disease due to shitty regulations lobbied by beef companies * ( oh , and what do you know , a decade later after it starts and you ca n't even tell if your beef is horse ) * . 
  how many people were infected by that same disease in america ? 
  yep , this guy get 's it . 
  i do it because i 'm a american . 
  help our fellow citizens . 
  i 'd help your ass . 
  it 's weird , because that shows the ** exact opposite ** when you factor in gdp growth ... lol , 
  you know my favorite thing about canadian movies ? 
  you do n't know it 's canadian until they pull out money . 
  pretty funny to watch the foaming at the mouth some canadians do when you confuse them with americans ... and that 's probably because so much of your informal national identity is based around * not being american * ... which is odd ... never found it healthy to base much of your identity on * not * being something ... and for the record , you 'd be the 51-60th states , not just the 51st one  puerto rico just voted to become a state , and the official referendum is on the way , so shit , it might even by the 52-61st states if you 're not quick . 
  yes , americans are fucking stupid . 
  yeah , after it had flooded the entire market for what was probably years . 
  but yeah , when shit like that happens here , i 'll just go with that : * `` you see , we caught it , even though it spread across the entire united states and weaseled itself into every state market , we caught it . 
  you know ... after that ... but still * . 
  yes ? 
  if you have a cock might as well measure it . 
  you ai n't never measure your shit ? 
  i know my length ** and ** girth to the god damn millimeter . 
  [ yeah , thank god that 's a pipe dream that 'll never , ever be feasible . 
  ] ( http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/north-american-free-trade-agreement-nafta ) [ and luckily the level of corruption in the european union is n't * ` breathtaking ' * . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26014387 ) [ i mean , come on , what 's the worse that 's happened in regards to trade laws & regulations ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_meat_adulteration_scandal ), 
  meh , still higher in nominal gdp . 
  so , in essence , we still have the largest economy in the world . 
  yes , it 's very cold when a foreign country invades you and annexes a region . 
  i 'm sure if they did that to west germany in 1972 it would 've still been called the cold war . 
  [ no they have n't ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html ) . 
  i know exactly what article you 're talking about , which is why i 'm disputing it since other sources give different numbers . 
  i never said it persisted , i just said we 'd do it better than rhodes and others did with that . 
  [ and as i pointed out above as contemporary example ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_unification_movement ), 
  other people give different numbers for ppp though . 
  i do n't think 4chan existed back in [ the late 19th century ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_federation ) . 
  though [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_unification_movement ) probably would 've been a better example . 
  regardless , it 'll still go better than your imperial federation idea . 
  we 'll just snap up canada as the next ten states if you want to play this game . 
  lol, 
  as i said , i believe it 's flawed . 
  sadly , you might be right . 
  i always really admired mustafa kemal atat\u00fcrk for the foundation & direction he gave turkey . 
  it almost hurts to see erdogan do whatever he can to tear that foundation down and change the republic 's direction . 
  eh , i 'll begrudgingly accept that as plausible . 
  but not at the end of this year . 
  you do n't support [ esperanto ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/esperanto ) becoming the official language of the european union !?!?!, 
  0_0 nah , lol , but i feel where you 're coming from completely . 
  yeah , china just needs to grow $ 7 trillion in a single year with a 80-90 % gdp growth rate . 
   i got some serious problems with that article , not just because i prefer nominal * ( where even the best predictions puts china 16 to 20-years away from surpassing us ) * , but also because even other international/national bodies measuring ppp still put it a couple years to a decade away . 
  well , [ you kinda already do ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_law#supremacy ) . 
  and it 's hard enough gettin ' congress to agree on foreign policy at times , imagine if each state was allowed sovereignty . 
  [ an ' we right on yo ' ass cuh ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/01/pdf/text.pdf ) . 
  see you in a couple years . 
  no problem lol, 
  you got ta convince european countries to put the interests of europe before themselves if you want that . 
   and that includes ceding sovereignty to the european union * ( eu parliament , which should probably get legislative initiative as well , & the commission get much stronger authority , and the council 's authority is reduced at the same time ) * , a unified foreign policy and a unified currency/fiscal union . 
  a integrated military would probably help too , but it 's not a requirement , hell , the united states relied on state militias to field the majority of it 's forces up until the start of the 20th century * ( the civil war was a taste of what the modern-era would require , but many people in government did n't take to that taste and went back to the old ways immediately afterwards ) * . 
  those ... those are some photo shoot level cat pics you got going there buddy ... . 
  ** `` russia mad it 's former satellite states are no longer satellite states '' **, 
  yeah , i never liked the * `` terrorist '' * moniker for a lot of things . 
  somebody going into a mosque or marketplace and blowing himself up to kill as many civilians as possible is a terrorist . 
  somebody trying to kill american * ( or another country 's ) * soldiers , even if it means blowing himself up , is n't a terrorist . 
  it 's like calling kamikaze pilots terrorists .
