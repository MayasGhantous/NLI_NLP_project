  not static protection . 
  and everybody believes that [ except for russian defense ministers ] ( http://www.rense.com/general42/firststrike.htm ) and [ past russia/soviet military plans ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563692/soviet-plan-for-ww3-nuclear-attack-unearthed.html ) . 
  and the fact that [ they dropped the * `` pledge of no first use '' * in 1993 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/world/russia-drops-pledge-of-no-first-use-of-atom-arms.html ) and that [ russian military doctrine states that russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons * `` in response to a large-scale conventional aggression '' * ] ( http://www.pugwash.org/reports/nw/federov.htm ) . 
  so yeah , everybody believes that , except for the russian government . 
  how do you get to sweden & lativa again ? 
  was there a overland route built there too ? 
  or do russian submarines and fighters do what you want and tell them do ? 
  there 's also a huge amount of space for a supply line into lithuania ... you know ... that small sliver between * [ belarus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_state ) and kalingrad * ... oh and wait ... did sweden & finland join nato ? 
  or did norway join the european union ? 
  they did all of this ** and ** built a underground tunnel through the baltics ? 
  holy fuck !, 
  wow dude , thanks for telling me about this . 
  and ugh ... being the ones who called for and participated heavily in * ( with america being reluctant too get involved at first ) * does kinda make the operations meaningful ... and if they were n't ... than that 's even worse ... and yes , the french needed much less help in mali * ( where the enemy was n't has advanced as gaddafi ) * than libya , ** but it still needed help ** . 
  [ libya , europe and the future of nato : always waiting for the u.s. cavalry ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato )  america was visibly reluctant to get involved , let alone lead the action . 
  and , having helped to knock out libya 's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes , it pulled back from the front-line operations . 
  but america 's role remains essential , not least in providing air-to-air refuelling , as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the european allies . 
  [ nato commander : eu could not do libya without us ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/115650 )  nato major-general marcel druart , addressing the european parliament committee on security and defence on tuesday ( 20 march ) , said nato relied heavily on us military expertise on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) capabilities . 
  [ french urgency , u.s. caution collide in mali operation ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/26/us-usa-france-mali-idusbre90p04n20130126 )  * ( reuters ) * - france 's military intervention in mali has revived trans-atlantic tensions over security issues , this time involving a key counterterrorism battlefield , along with dismay from critics who see u.s. president barack obama as too reluctant to use military force . 
  [ dempsey : france formally asks for u.s. aid in mali ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/ )  the french government has formally requested u.s. military assistance to combat al qaeda in the islamic maghreb in mali , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the american forces press service on thursday [ u.s. aiding france 's military operation in mali ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563710/ )  * bamako , mali * - france 's foreign minister said sunday that the united states is providing communications and transport help for an international military intervention aimed at wresting mali 's north out of the hands of islamist extremists . 
  ** but you can have it both ways . 
  ** even if it means a slight tax increase , you can afford 2 % of your gdp going to military spending and a strong social security net * ( though perhaps not a complete welfare state , but still ) * . 
  ** it can do both you know . 
  ** 2 % gdp spending is n't comparable to 5-10 % gdp spending . 
  ensuring your country is safe & secure can go a long way in fostering the environment needed for that kind of legislation . 
  plus , poland is one of the strongest and fastest growing economies in the eu . 
  just like america 's military spending is n't holding back it 's social spending , or the commonly-repeated lie that the only reasons europeans have good social security nets is because of there subsidized security from america * ( though it does make it cheaper ) * . 
  it 's actually rather infuriating being a american ; because given the immense leverage our military affords us on the international scene and the strong trade benefits this affords us , it would be cheaper to reinforce that social security now than in the case we lose that international precedence . 
  i ca n't help , but draw similarities with the uk and the end of the british empire . 
  it would 've been * way more affordable & easier * to set-up such a system when the empire was at it 's height instead of when it was at it 's twilight . 
  also , keep in mind , i really doubt that the european union would 've even happened had it not been for the security & stability the united states , france & the united kingdom guaranteed to it 's predecessor organization * ( european atomic energy community & the european coal & steel community ) * through nato . 
  the military and your country 's defense should not be ignored nor underestimated . 
  ukraine , belarus , you get my point . 
  and that 's ignoring the land border russia shares with finland . 
  and yes , europe 's military does focus on domestic defense ... of western europe ... it ca n't respond effectively to geographically-isolated members , quickly and decisively , like finalnd & estonia . 
  or maybe they built that baltic bridge & tunnel you were going on about ? 
  and if they 're so focused on it they should n't be carrying out operations in libya & mali than realize at their present capabilities , without increasing military spending or taking a long-ass time , they ca n't do them without american support . 
  i do n't think you quite understand how important time is in a war , especially a limited one . 
  shit is n't going to always be long , drawn out attritional wars like the world wars , especially with nuclear weapons at play . 
  how the fuck do you get to estonia overland again ? 
  has there been a baltic bridge or tunnel constructed that i do n't know about ? 
  and russian power projection ai n't a fucking thing compared to the soviets , but it still a thing , and it 's much more capable than it 's contemporary european nations , whom lack extensively in this regard and ca n't organize properly , even if it 's libya or mali , without american support . 
  it 's much easier for russia to roll over ukraine into the baltics , and protect it 's supply lines with the most advanced mobile aa in the world , than it is for the european union to maintain a supply line across the baltics , which despite the threat you down-play , is still lurking with russian submarines and in bomber/fighter range . 
  also , just like turkey can lock out russia from the mediterranean , the russians can lock out nato from the black sea . 
  the chokepoint at bosporus goes both ways . 
  wwii , at it 's start , was not a clear ideology war . 
  and i never said russia is fascist or imply that putin was hitler the second , but to ignore the military capability of russia is the same as ignoring the military capability of germany during wwii . 
  the causes for each are different , the leaders are different , putin is not hitler and russians are not nazis ; never have i implied or insinuated that . 
  but i did say it 's foolish to not be prepared against a potential adversary . 
  belgium might not get invaded , but there are legitimate security threats to eu member-states in the baltics and belgium & other member-states collectively can not respond decisively to that without american support . 
  there eu common defense & security agreement is a thing . 
  the north american treaty organization is a thing . 
  and at the moment , belgium , and other eu/nato member-states are unprepared and incapable of upholding those obligations in a timely & decisive manner ; which is critical in the nuclear age . 
  and i 'm arguing against that ? 
  and even in that case , the military is still a vital part of the discussion ? 
  which is why he 's talking about it ? 
  even if he has a different opinion ? 
  * lulz *, 
  you 're right about crimea , which is why i edited it out before your reply . 
  and i never doubted that there would n't be bitter partisan resistance , i was simply stating that if the eu does n't prepare itself , does n't up it 's military spending to respond decisively to any russian invasion , to stop estonia & your own country from falling completely , it leaves them in a ** very shitty position ** . 
  it 'd be much better to threaten nuclear holocaust * with * estonia & your country than * without * estonia & your country . 
  than russia is placed in the shitty negotiating position , and your negotiating position is fucking critical when talking about nuclear warfare . 
  i do n't know much about switzerland during wwi , and i apologize for bringing it up , but i do know that switzerland was as strong policy of neutrality through military-preparedness , which was exemplified through-out wwii and the cold war , and whom 's doctrine still exists today , even if to a lessened degree . 
  and belgium was absolutely unprepared for both wars . 
  especially the second world war . 
  it 's neutrality still would 've been infringed , but it might 've been able to fight and hold-off better , and in the case of wwii * ( although it might not have been completely neutral here , it 's preparedness was still lacking ) * , give it 's allies more time to re-group and launch a counter-offensive * ( the fall of belgium was one of the leading factors for the collapse of the allied line ) * . 
  the condemnation that churchill lays on the belgian king for surrendering is kinda fucked up too , given that in their position , they really had no choice , but like i said , that would 've been different if they were better prepared . 
  i do n't talk about the military all the time , only when it 's the subject of the conversation or a vital part of the debate we 're having . 
  and switzerland was militarily prepared through-out both world wars , deterred a invasion during the second and probably would 've been one of the best off if the cold war ever went hot , yet they remained neutral and i would n't accuse them of fear-mongering * ( or the fact that many of those policies are in practice today , even if to a lessened extent , swiss military doctrine still revolves around it ) * . 
  and china considers those islands their * own * land and japan considers those island their * own * land , but neither china nor japan would want such a conflict to go nuclear . 
  and you 're right about south korea 's change in policy , which is something i support , but i was just pointing out that instant reaction and escalation is n't always the case when facing nuclear-capable power . 
  america installed nukes in turkey and the soviets installed nukes in cuba . 
  both were on the precipice of nuclear war with each other , even though not a single nation was annexed or occupied . 
  it 's probably one of the closest , if not * the closest * that the world has ever gotten to nuclear conflict , and not a single shot would 've been fired to start-it off . 
  and other countries have already been following this tactic . 
  as i 'm pretty sure i mentioned above , it 's the same doctrine that chinese military generals and professors are advocating for any potential conflict against american allies * ( whom we hold mutual defense treaties with ) * . 
  it 's the same strategy they 'll use in any conflict in the south china sea , even if it 's over a small , shitty island . 
  it 's the same thing north korea does . 
  look at a couple years ago ; they sank a south korean warship , shelled a south korean island , but it did n't escalate because seoul can be wiped out in a couple hours by entrench north korea artillery guns across the dmz in the mountains * ( we 'd destroy them , but not in time to save seoul , south korea 's capital , wealthiest and most populated city ) * . 
  and because north korea can nuke portions of south korea , if not reach all of south korea , especially the south , where a shit-load of military infrastructure is * ( it 's outside north korea artillery , unlike seoul , and can respond decisively to any specific break-out from the dmz given it 's southern position ) *, 
  that logic would be sound if the exact opposite did n't happen in real life over cuba & turkey . 
  neither of which was occupied either . 
   or the fact that [ russia calls tactical nuclear strikes `` de-escaltion '' ] ( http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation ) * ( though i think i pointed this out before , sorry if i 'm being repetitive , but it 's a important point ) * . 
  ** edit : ** and remember any warsaw offensive against nato during the cold war relied heavily on tactical nuclear strikes , and nato itself had nuclear landmines/charges in bridges or near chokepoints and shit . 
  the difference being , russia & america possess extensive power projection , eu member-states do n't . 
  it 's much easier for them to defend/attack estonia & alaska than it is for europe . 
  hence why the eu ca n't defend a country like estonia or finland in a timely and decisive manner . 
  ** you just ca n't . 
  ** fix it , ignore it or keep whining . 
  and kalingrad * is a little different * than having to cross the baltic sea filled with russian submarines and fighters . 
   in a total war of attrition , you 'll be fine , but this is n't about a total war of attrition , it 's about short , limited & decisive wars , which you just ca n't handle yourself without the united states . 
   doubtful . 
  if this were so easy , why nothing like this was ever done during cold war ? 
  why were the annexed states allowed to secede in the first place ? 
  they could 've just said `` fuck you we nuke your ass if you even fart against us ! '' . 
  it was done . 
  it was called the budapest memorandum and it 's why russia was able to stroll freely into crimea . 
   nobody is going to use nukes on disputes that are not on their original territory . 
  even if it were original territory , nukes would come into play as a last resort - when nothing else is left to lose - when total collapse in unavoidable anyway . 
  and this only goes to back-up my point completely . 
  estonia gone does n't threaten the total collapse of the european union * ( or ... maybe it does with this one . . but not the other two ) * , america or even western europe in general * ( where the two eu nuclear states are ) * .
