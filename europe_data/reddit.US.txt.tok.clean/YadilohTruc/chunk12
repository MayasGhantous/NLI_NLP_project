   and switzerland was prepared , yet it did n't cause either world war , in fact , it deterred a invasion during wwii specifically * because * it was military prepared . 
  but you talk about the security dilemma , and ignore the cold war , which , in my opinion , military alliances , preparness and mad played vital roles in preventing from ever-going hot . 
  also , let 's not act like russia does n't stage * `` military exercises '' * on the border of finland every time it has a exercise with a fellow nato/eu member and that it does n't use some damn strong language every time finland contemplates nato membership * ( even though it 's unlikely as hell , russia still uses some threatening language ... which is slightly confusing ... since i would think that kind of action would drive finland even more into nato 's direction ... ) * . 
  than why did all the ones in nato agree to the [ 2 % spending requirement in 2006 ] ( http://www.aviationweek.com/blogs.aspx?plckblogid=blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7&amp;plckpostid=blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7post:3746e462-d9f3-43bd-90d2-769ec8209630 ) ? 
  and why did certain countries in question call for/participate in operations in libya & mali ? 
  and why would they sign the eu 's common defense & security agreement when power projection is key to defending countries like estonia or finland which lack easy over-land supply paths like germany or france * ( or ... why did they let those two join if they could n't defend them ) * ? 
  but russia would never go against a unified european continent conventionally for the same reasons you mentioned . 
  it would only pull some shit like invade finland & estonia , occupy it , and then threaten a nuclear holocaust if europe mobilizes to re-take them . 
  this is the future . 
  it 's why [ china 's training & military doctrine revolves around short , limited & decisive wars ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2014/03/of-course-the-pla-is-planning-for-a-short-sharp-war/ ) and why [ russia calls tactical nuclear strikes `` de-escalation '' ] ( http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation ) . 
  any future war between nuclear combatants wo n't be a total war like you think it will be . 
  it 'll be a limited war . 
  and europe wo n't have supply lines for estonia or finland like it does for germany or france , ** it needs power projection for this . 
  ** to defend it 's member-states , europe * ( as in the european union ) * has to have this capability , but they do n't , forcing them to ask for u.s. assistance , which while this increases my country 's influence on the continent , it also detracts from our influence in the pacific , where we 're trying to pivot to * ( and away from our cold war-based europe first strategy ) * . 
  no , not every problem is a nail , but you 're a fucking idiot if you throw away the hammer & the tool box . 
  not everything can be fixed with a paintbrush , even if it makes it look a lil prettier . 
  and omg states pursuing their national interests ? 
  i 'm glad germany has n't done that with nordstream even though it posed a security/intelligence threat to sweden and can economically isolate poland & other eastern european states * ( now russia can cut off gas to them without cutting off gas to the rest of western europe ) * . 
  by the way , i wonder how schroeder is enjoying that gazprom job ? 
  lol also , we 're trying to pivot away , but we got this thing called nato and we 're not just going to abandon our allies in mali & libya , even if it goes against our immediate interests . 
  yes , but even with that , the other 33 % is still a little bit higher than the eu . 
  so overall , across the board , we 're doing better than the eu , if only a * little bit * better in that regard . 
  i mean , we 're growing at like something 10x-12x that of the eu * ( .2 % compared to 2.2 % ) * , so that 33 % is still 3-4x that of the eu . 
  and that is only if you think the amount of money going into the 1 % of europeans is minuscule , which i hold my doubts on , but do n't much about so i 'm going to hold out judgement . 
  eh , you responded to my point in kind so it seems you were interested in the discussion . 
  and i 'm here , you can cry about it , but it 's not going to make me leave . 
  finland is not in nato , there 's no obligation for the united states to get in a nuclear stand-off with them * ( but we would anyway ... meh ... ) * . 
  and mad ** is a thing ** , which is why all potential wars between nuclear powers in the future will be short , limited and decisive . 
  russia wo n't take estonia and fight a conventional war to hold it , it will take estonia and threaten a nuclear war with anybody who tries to take it back . 
  china will do the same with any of those disputed islands in the south china sea . 
  any fight for estonia or disputed island in the pacific will be determined in the first couple days/weeks , not the first months . 
  if estonia is taken over completely , and not contested , it 's over . 
  the only hope of estonia is for america & the eu to respond while the fighting is still heavy , before the entire country is lost , and the eu is incapable of that without america at the moment . 
  there 's a reason [ china has been training for exactly this ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2014/03/of-course-the-pla-is-planning-for-a-short-sharp-war/ ) and [ russia calls tactical nuclear strikes `` de-escalation '' ] ( http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation ) . 
  he deleted it . 
  and i do n't know , but enough to deter it and give it 's allies more time than 2-weeks to come help it . 
  fuck , switzerland was neutral during wwii with no concrete allies and it deterred the nazis from invading because of it 's military preparedness , despite hitler calling it a * `` pimple on the face of europe '' * and drawing up invasion plans . 
  they were able to deter the nazis , even though it was a guarantee they would lose , because the nazis looked at it as too costly of a invasion and a unnecessary diversion of resources . 
  the balkans set-back operation barbarossa a season , switzerland would 've set it back a year or more . 
  i do n't know , perhaps to create a buffer state between russia-occupied finland & nato-aligned norway ? 
  give them more control over the baltic sea given it 's huge importance to the russian fleet headquartered at st. petersburg ? 
  fuck if i know , i just know it 's stupid not to be prepared for a country that threatens your fellow eu members and could possibly turn into a threat one day . 
  belgium learned this lesson the hard way , and switzerland survived both world wars & a cold war because it followed it to the tee . 
   and how did libya and mali prove the inadequacy of european logistics ?

  europe has some of the most advanced technology and best trained soldiers in the world , but that does n't mean shit if you ca n't get them where they need to be or keep them supplied when they 're there . 
  sure , you can defend germany or france , but what about estonia & finland ? 
  what if you need to respond immediately , to stop either from falling and it devolving into a nuclear stand-off ? 
  you ca n't do it without the united states . 
  sure , you can do it in the long-run , but if estonia & finland are under russia 's boot , and not in contention , russia will just threaten a nuclear war if you mobilize and try to re-take them . 
  when concerning nuclear powers , whether russia & the european union or china & america , any war will either be a nuclear holocaust or a short , limited & decisive one . 
  and this is exactly the type of thing that the chinese military has been training for and it 's generals & professors advocating . 
  and as we see in crimea , russia has already put it in practice , rather successfully mind you . 
  europe is simply , at this point in time , incapable of pursuing this type of war without u.s. support & hard power .
