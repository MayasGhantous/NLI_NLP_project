  europe lacks the power projection and logistical ability to help sweden in the predicted two-week time-table they 've given themselves in holding out against russia . 
  libya and mali went to prove the inadequacy of european logistics , intelligence and first-strike capabilities ; sweden & finland would only go to cement that . 
  ~ ~ i have no doubts , but still , it was out of desperation , not choice . ~ ~ ~ ~ just because you can macgyver something to be effective does n't excuse the fact you had to do it because your supply lines and support services failed you . ~ ~ it appears you are correct and i apologize . 
  but european militaries still lack extensively in logistical , intelligence and first-strike * ( b2s and cruiser missiles to take out aa so the other bombers can come in ) * capabilities . 
  i edited some sources into my original post to show this . 
  ~ ~ no , ** it was because they ran out of ammo ** , yes it worked , but it would 've worked even better if they had 1,000 lbs high explosive bomb . 
  the country in question does not have a policy of switching out it 's anti-armor armaments with concrete bombs ... that 's stupid ... ~ ~ it appears you are correct and i apologize . 
  but european militaries still lack extensively in logistical , intelligence and first-strike * ( b2s and cruiser missiles to take out aa so the other bombers can come in ) * capabilities . 
  i edited some sources into my original post to show, 
  if i do n't survive , tell my wife , * `` hello '' * . 
  this is n't just a swedish thing though , it 's a european thing . 
  some of the most advanced weapons and technology in the world , some of the best trained soldiers in the world , but ca n't even keep open a proper supply line across the med to libya * ( ~ ~ iirc one european country was reduced to dropping cement training bombs on libyan targets after their ammo ran out ~ ~ ) * or maintain up-to-date intelligence on the situation . 
  i mean , whether mali or libya , europe is in constant need of re-fueling tankers or strategic transport , and it usually just asks the united states to provide this . 
  when i talk about this people get defensive and shit , like i 'm saying that american soldiers and weapon systems are superior , but i 'm not , i 'm saying the support needed to keep american soldiers and weapon systems in the fight is superior . 
  in the same vain of what you said , you can have the best training and the best weapons in the world , but it does n't mean a damn thing if you ca n't get them where you need them to be or worse ca n't keep them supplied when they 're there . 
  ** edit : to give proof just how bad european militaries are lacking in this regard : ** [ libya , europe and the future of nato : always waiting for the u.s. cavalry ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato )  america was visibly reluctant to get involved , let alone lead the action . 
  and , having helped to knock out libya 's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes , it pulled back from the front-line operations . 
  but america 's role remains essential , not least in providing air-to-air refuelling , as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the european allies . 
  [ nato commander : eu could not do libya without us ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/115650 )  nato major-general marcel druart , addressing the european parliament committee on security and defence on tuesday ( 20 march ) , said nato relied heavily on us military expertise on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) capabilities . 
  [ french urgency , u.s. caution collide in mali operation ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/26/us-usa-france-mali-idusbre90p04n20130126 )  * ( reuters ) * - france 's military intervention in mali has revived trans-atlantic tensions over security issues , this time involving a key counterterrorism battlefield , along with dismay from critics who see u.s. president barack obama as too reluctant to use military force . 
  [ dempsey : france formally asks for u.s. aid in mali ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/ )  the french government has formally requested u.s. military assistance to combat al qaeda in the islamic maghreb in mali , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the american forces press service on thursday [ u.s. aiding france 's military operation in mali ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563710/ )  * bamako , mali * - france 's foreign minister said sunday that the united states is providing communications and transport help for an international military intervention aimed at wresting mali 's north out of the hands of islamist extremists . 
  [ nato : only six out of 26 nations meet defense spending target ] ( http://www.aviationweek.com/blogs.aspx?plckblogid=blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7&amp;plckpostid=blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7post:3746e462-d9f3-43bd-90d2-769ec8209630 )  nato has published detailed information on the defense expenditures of its member nations for 2007 . 
  the figures underline the enormous differences in defense spending between the various nations . 
   probably the most telling figure is the defense expenditure as a percentage of each country 's gross domestic product . 
  nato recommends that this should be at least 2 % ** note : on that last one , the numbers went down to like only four member-states since the time of it 's publication , so meh **, 
  well considering sweden is one of the largest arms exporters * per capita * , with only probably israel giving them a run for their money , a little domestic spending to guarantee your own security is better in my mind than arms exporting to brazil & south africa to guarantee * their security * . 
  you mean kinda like everybody else in nato has to pay for sweden 's defense even though sweden is n't in nato so we really do n't have too , but everybody knows we will anyway ? 
  what was that swedish assessment again ? 
  that could stand against any potential russian invasion for two weeks ? 
  what did you think would happen after 2 weeks ? 
  which is why the us needs europe as a counter-balance against them & russia . 
  we 're approaching a multi-polar world , the united states wants to make sure it can at least find on great power it can cooperate with on the level us and europe do now . 
  even if it 's lessened , it 's still better than nothing or a divided europe . 
  america does n't fear competition from the west . 
  ** it fears being the only west left . 
  ** we 're going to be rivals , but we 're going to be friendly rivals , but generally european interests align with ours ... generally ... and that 's not really the case with china or russia or even brazil really . 
  we 're sacrificing influence in europe to build-it-up elsewhere . 
  unless europe fucks it up and collapses into itself , i think it 's a rather wise decision in retrospect . 
  the cold war is over and the focal point of the world has moved east . 
  you see , here you go forgetting about asia . 
  this century has been dubbed the * `` asian century '' * for a reason , and that 's where the future lies . 
  our influence on the continent will drop by shifting away from our cold war european strategy , but it will grow by being able to focus more resources in the pacific and having to divert less to eastern europe & shit like libya . 
  it 's a trade off , and a smart one i believe . 
  the far east is where the future of the united states ' lies . 
  yeah , that 's the point , we 're trying to move away from europe and turn towards the pacific . 
  that 's where the future lies . 
  ugh , no shit , but that does n't mean shit . 
  yeah , good thing ya 'll do n't have that in the eu ... you know ... with the united kingdom in 5-eyes and germany building nordstream with russia ... 
  yeah ... sorry about that ... kinda went off like a emotional bitch and overreacted . 
  heh ... and they say germans are the ones without a sense of humor ... lol, 
  no ... you actually did ... you passed catalonia 's [ statute of autonomy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statute_of_autonomy ) in a public referendum and classified it 's [ identity as a nationality ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autonomous_communities_of_spain#constitutional_and_statutory_framework ) . 
  all of that is devolved from the central government , which is regulated by the constitution , so by extension all your present autonomy is devolved from that as well , and to quote your constitution :  the constitution is based on ** the indissoluble unity of the spanish nation ** , the common and indivisible homeland of all spaniards ; it recognizes and guarantees the right to self-government of the nationalities and regions of which it is composed and the solidarity among them all . 
  which ... to remind you ... your representatives signed , and then your fellow citizens voted for a rather vital section of it ... so you basically did vote for it ... overwhelmingly ... both directly through the referendum and indirectly through representatives . 
  well ... it 's actually not ... since it fully expresses it 's basic rights and it agreed to be a nation devolved from the state of spain * ( you know ... constitution ... unitary state , etc. 
  ) * ... and you know ... not mentioning the fact that spain is decentralized like a motha fucker and catalonia has immense autonomous authority ... 
  was it devolved by a unitary state and cemented in a constitution that the nation in question agreed too ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  when did i compare the united states to catalonia ? 
  where did i say it was superior ? 
  when did i even compare the revolutions ? 
  or their populations ? 
  when did i mention it being a super power ? 
  ~ ~ anyway , i 'm glad to see that germany really took the leadership reigns in helping lead the european union in this crisis when it needed a strong , healthy economy to do so in the eurozone . 
  oh , and totes good idea with nordstream and giving schroeder a job with gazprom , fucking genius , never saw that backfiring . ~ ~ ** edit : ** yeah ... sorry about that ... 
  like i said in my first post , you do n't know much about the european union . 
  it does n't devolve powers * to * member-states . 
  it 's power is devolved * from * member-states . 
  it is not a unitary state , it is a federation/confederacy . 
  you are a eu citizen , because you 're a spanish citizen , because spain is a member-state of the european union . 
  the day spain stops being a member-state , or the day you stop being a spanish citizen , is the day you stop being a eu citizen ** unless ** catalonia ascends to the european union , which is subject to spanish and other member-state approval . 
  eh , maybe you 're right on the political front , though personally i like to think of them more as coalitions than parties given the wide-ass spectrum they cover . 
  but anyway , yeah , i 'd still support such a thing today . 
  but i would n't support texas seceding from the united states . 
  ** you 're eu citizens because you 're spanish citizens and spain is a member-state ** how do you not understand this ? 
  if you leave a member-state , you do n't become the member-state . 
  the member-state still exists , it is you making a new country , you leaving spain , not the other way around . 
  treaty obligations and everything else , you know ... the treaties which established and regulate the eu ... . will be upheld by spain . 
  you need to sign the eu treaty to join the eu after you secede ... because you 're a new country with a blank slate ... . and only if spain or another member-state does n't veto you . 
  yes ? 
  i do n't think the eu is ready to take over the responsibilities such a precedent would set , nor do i think it would be in the interests of my country if nato 's combat capability is fucked even more by a major country like spain loosing a huge chunk of it 's economy and population . 
  would n't be as bad as scotland leaving the uk , but it would still hurt nato like a motha fucker , spain is still pretty large , wealthy and populated . 
  it 's in the 1st world for a reason . 
  it 's not that silly at all , i never implied it was . 
  i simply said you ca n't call a state anarchist when it has that many people , that much territorial control and the much of a structured government . 
  catalonia would n't be anarchist , but everybody and their mother seceding and declaring independence will , in my mind , lead to anarchy , which the original poster i replied to implied was what everybody wanted and deserved . 
  maybe it might turn into a good socialist anarchy , maybe a bloody capitalist anarchy , but anarchy none-the-less , and vulnerable to larger more organized states . 
  population of catalonia was never my gripe ; though the fact that the wishes of other spaniards , who are the majority , on the very fate of their country being disregarded is . 
  [ read this for more on my view on this and reply there if you want . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23o08j/catalonia_and_spain_end_game_scenarios/cgz0dk0?context=3 ), 
  but you will lose it if spain vetos your membership . 
  ** i can guarantee it ** . 
  if you 're that concerned you should n't have a american doing your research for you about your country and your region 's struggle to secede . 
  no , my problem is you compared them ** literally ** instead of ** figuratively ** . 
  but luxembourg is not a part of france . 
  it 's their country , they have a constitution that they all agreed too and a democratic government to represent them , as i said before , both regionally & nationally . 
  yeah , spain is decentralized , but it is still a unitary state . 
  all of your local government 's powers are * devolved * from the authority of madrid . 
  yes , you are a spanish citizen , so you are a eu citizen since spain is a member-state of the european union . 
  but if catalonia secedes ... you are a catalonia citizen ... not a spanish citizen ... not a citizen of the european union since you are not a member-state of the european union * ( pending spain 's approval of your membership ) * . 
  so in fact , yes , if you leave spanish citizenship it does mean that you leave eu citizenship .
