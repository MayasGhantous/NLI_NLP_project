  as that is one of the benefits of being a member-state ... which you may or may not be depending on if spain approves your accession to the union . 
  [ and here , go look for it . 
  ] ( http://www.eurotreaties.com/maastrichtext.html ) it 's pretty common knowledge though . 
  but that 's my point from a legal perspective ; as a federation , bavaria can do that , like texas can do it , but as a unitary state , catalonia ca n't without the central government 's permission . 
  is that fucked up ? 
  yeah , sure . 
  but eh ... if you did n't want this to happen than a unitary republic should 've never been set-up after franco , a spanish federation should 've been set-up instead . 
  you ... realize that the ** population of the entire world ** increased during this time period too ... right ? 
  how ... how many people do you think were in catalonia during the 1700s ? 
  how many people do you think live on the eastern seaboard of the united states today * ( here 's a hint , it 's more than 2.5 million ) * ? 
  ** edit : ** and i was n't really talking about catalonia , as much as a reply to a comment which said * `` what everybody wants '' * , which is true , but if everybody got independence and was instantly-recognized as their own self-determined , self-governing individual/political entity ... that would be anarchy ... 
  i think the world 's population is a little bigger too bud . 
   ** edit : ** and i was n't really talking about catalonia , as much as a reply to a comment which said * `` what everybody wants '' * , which is true , but if everybody got independence and was instantly-recognized as their own self-determined , self-governing individual/political entity ... that would be anarchy ... 
  it 's no different than central government-owned property in catalonia . 
  the road is mine ; i will maintain it and shoulder the burden myself . 
  i will not have bits and pieces of petoria annexed willy-nilly . 
  that road has been a defensive fortification and critical logistical route for the royal family since my grandpa moved into this house years ago , and you know what , the united nations will not tolerate you aggressively picking on me and seizing what you claim is * `` yours by right '' * . 
  the homeless bum who has lived on that road has filled out a referendum , he has agreed to be annexed into the principality of petoria along with the ground he resides on . 
  north was against slavery morally though . 
  so given that , you not only have the moral factor , but the economic factor , and of course the political factor of keeping the union together . 
  people always get into arguments about what the civil war was * really about * , but they never seem to realize it was about * all those things * . 
  eh , i doubt bavaria will ever secede either , it 's just a special example because it 's rather well-known that it 's like germany 's texas plus germany is a federal government so it 's easier to draw comparisons between unitary european countries and federal european countries to give readers context instead of between unitary european countries and a north american federation . 
  like i said , i apologize for the comparison to ireland . 
  it was a shitty analogy and one that does n't fit the context . 
  and scotland is undergoing it 's referendum * with the approval of westminister * because scotland 's authority is * devolved from westminister * . 
  that 's why it 's legal . 
  and yes , both are still subject to the central government , hence the point of a union & country . 
  and i argue that catalonia has extensive leeway when it comes to self-goverment , when it comes to autonomy , especially in a decentralized state like spain . 
  they are represented both locally , regionally and nationally . 
  of course they 're gon na have more influence locally and regionally than nationally ; just because california runs california does n't mean it can dominate the entire union . 
   it absolutely is currently a part of spain . 
  should get unilaterally declare independence , that changes . 
  than all spaniards have a say . 
  you could . 
  and spain could retaliate in some way . 
  and you could retaliate in some way . 
  and spain could retaliate in some way . 
  and you could retaliate in some way . 
  and spain could retaliate in some way . 
  and you could retaliate in some way . 
  yes . . there is ... it 's called the constitution and the fact that the powers are * devolved * to you because you are a * unitary state * . 
  and you did secede from the eu ... because spain is a member of the eu ... ** not you ** ... by leaving a member-state ... . you 're no longer a member-state ... spain is the successor state of the new non-catalonia spain member-state ... not you ... spain will still have to approve your membership if you chose to apply . 
  so yeah ... i 'm pretty damn sure the treaties says otherwise ... lol, 
  hard to be a anarchist when talking about a federation of 13 unitary states with millions of people which covered the entire eastern coastline of the continental united states . 
  you know ... a federation led by a guy from the southern aristocracy , who ran a highly organized regular military , who after the revolution put down a rebellion of farmers who refused to pay taxes and who 's vice president was a keen advocate of increased centralization , going on to establish the bank of the united states . 
  those were faulty comparisons ; and i apologize . 
  but spain still has a population of 40,000,000 people . 
  it 's incredibly de-centralized , the autonomous communities are some of the most autonomous in the word with wide-ranging powers and a say in government . 
  they are represented , democratically and fairly . 
  and they are still apart of the nation of spain ; their representatives agreed to this constitution , they signed it , they ratified it . 
  and for all intents and purposes , we are * all * representative democracies . 
  catalonia is not the only part of spain , and both figuratively and literally , i am not wrong for calling it * a part of spain * . 
  actually , it was completely in the heavily-populated and industrialized north 's economic interests to do that * ( slave labor is hard to compete with ... poor factory workers do n't like that ) * , while at the same time retaining the resources of the south and preserving the union * ( i do n't think we 'd be a superpower if shit went ... south ... lol ) * . 
  have you seen doomsday preppers yo ? 
  i 'm good to go for 6 months , if not a year . 
  and until i run out of food or water , * you have no right to evict me or use violent force through law enforcement/military to remove me * . 
  you must take that long-ass de-tour for work for the whole next year , and no sir the ambulance can not come down this road to get to the hospital faster , because this is my country , and i do n't care what you think . 
  maybe when i starve out you can come in and clean out the mess , but until them , respect my autho-ri-tah !, 
  no , it does matter , it 's matters very strongly . 
  if the irish public did n't support north ireland 's independence and the treaties , there would still be trouble right now and the ira would n't be the shell of it 's former self that it is . 
  it was done with the consultation of both countries . 
  ireland had a heavy say , a heavy influence , on the process . 
  so with that in mind , this is still spain , there are still tens of millions of more spanish citizens who want a say in * their country 's * fate , in * their country 's * future . 
  if we do n't give a country this benefit , than what the fuck is the point of a country ? 
  why do we recognize them as sovereign ? 
  why was territorial integrity such a vital part of the budapest memorandum ? 
  the only people this is between is catalonians and spaniards . 
  it 's both of their countries whether you like it or not ; whether some catalonians like it or not . 
  no , but * approval of all new members by all present members is * . 
  spain is a present member , a founding member , and like you said yourself , is still spain . 
  catalonia is a new country . 
  spain will have to approve you . 
  all these threats you 're making go to prove my point , you 'd still have to * convince spain * . 
  the question is if loosing you culturally and economically , at the expense of popular opinion from the millions of other spaniards who do n't want to see the secession , is enough for them to actually deny you . 
  only the future knows these answers , or if it 'll even get that far . 
  and no , the term is ** unitary ** . 
  it 's the exact opposite of federalism . 
  you can be a centralized federation and a decentralized unitary state and vice versa . 
  the difference is , a federation derives it 's power and authority from each other , a unitary republic derives it 's power and authority from the state itself . 
  the american government is federal , american states are unitary . 
  my state devolves authority to my county government , like spain does for your autonomous community . 
  [ to quote wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autonomous_communities_of_spain )  since sovereignty resides in the nation as a whole -- and is represented in the state-wide or central institutions of government -- and not in the communities , spain is not a federation but a highly decentralized unitary states that has devolved power to the communities , which in turn exercise their right to self-government within the limits set forth in the constitution . 
  yeah . 
  anarchy is great until you have to go up against somebody who is n't a anarchist . 
  i declare this the person 's republic of petoria . 
  and fuck anybody who says otherwise . 
  i do n't care if you got to get to work today cunt , nobody goes through petoria without a passport so get your ass down to the state department . 
  god damn , if they really wanted free movement they should 've convinced their government to sign a treaty with me thirty minutes ago when i first declared this serene republic . 
  how so ? 
  is the european union truly ready to step-up and be a * actual * federal government ? 
  is it anywhere near having a common foreign policy that can be decided unilaterally or a integrated military able to be deployed without a bureaucratic cluster-fuck ? 
  is ti able to respond quickly to crises in general ? 
  have france & the united kingdom not made some pretty impressive cuts to their military , thus hindering their power projection capability and increasing reliance on the united states for logistical , intelligence & first-strike capabilities ? 
  do the amount of meps you have not help increase or decrease your country 's influence over the eu ? 
  does your country 's economy and population not help determine how much weight you can move in the eu and on the global stage ? 
  do more members on the commission & council not complicate a already complicated process more ? 
  does a stronger military not give you more influence on the international scene ? 
  i mean ... i do n't understand how fucking up your soft & hard power ... and then relying on a institution which is far from having it 's training wheels taken off ... is a good idea ... * at all * ... . . 
  if it 's a secession , than that only gives more credence to my argument . 
  spain is still spain , spain still upholds all the treaty obligations and requirements that it signed in the past under the title and authority of spain .
