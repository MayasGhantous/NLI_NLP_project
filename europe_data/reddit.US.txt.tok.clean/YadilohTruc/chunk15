  you have none of that . 
  you have no treaties . 
  you are on a clean slate , everythings wiped clean . 
  you are not in the european union if you secede because you are a new nation and * spain * was the one who joined the european union . 
  and for new nations to join the european union requires the support of * all members * , so if spain says no , you 're not a member ; if anybody says no , you 're not a member . 
  like i said , you can convince the eu to write a new treaty , but than they 'd have to ignore or exclude spain ... so you 'd still have * convince spain * . 
  and ** you are a unitary state ** . 
  spain is a unitary state . 
  you have your own parliament because that power has been ** devolved to you ** by the * spanish parliament * . 
  you are a autonomous community of the spanish state , not a state in the spanish federation . 
  ** edit : ** my apologies about centralized/unitary mix-up . 
  corrected . 
  kinda fucked up the debate so sorry about that . 
  but whether talking about your block or your state , does not your municipality 's residents or your nation 's citizens get a say ? 
  and if you ignore them , is it truly that wrong for that state you seceded from to invade and re-annex you ? 
  or should we all consider the guy who founds a brand new municipality on his block , without the consideration of the rest of the residents in his municipality or county , a hero because he shoots the police officers coming to arrest him for blocking public roads ? 
  yes , it 's reductio ad absurdum , but i think it works as a rather well in helping explain the context i 'm trying to get across . 
  analogies are a common thing in rhetoric . 
  no , you still do n't know how the eu works . 
  even if you split , spain will still be spain , a founding member of the european union . 
  it will be the successor state , with the successor state 's responsibilities and treaty obligations , not you . 
  same thing with russia & the soviet union . 
  an quite frankly , i do n't quite think you understand what your own country is . 
  ** you are a ~ ~ * centralized * ~ ~ * unitary * state , constitutionally recognized as a autonomous community * of * spain , with powers * devolved * to you ** . 
  you are not a federal government , and even if you were , i still would n't hold my breath . 
  america was a federation that held up state rights , but the civil war still happened to preserve the union , specifically because there was no * `` out '' * in the constitution , just like there 's no * `` out '' * in your constitution . 
  an like i said , the south had a lot more going for them from a legal point-of-view than you , given that america is a federation and you 're a ~ ~ centralized ~ ~ unitary state . 
  similar comparison can be made with germany 's federal system & bavaria . 
  i do n't think you quite understand how the eu works . 
  because there ai n't no way that 's happening without spanish approval ; so you either need to convince spain to let you join , or convince the eu to re-write it 's treaty and ignore/exclude spain ... or convince spain to sign ... and what about the rest of spaniards ? 
  does their opinion not matter ? 
  are you not apart of spain ? 
  from the hapsburgs to the bourbons ? 
  from the republics to the dictatorship ? 
  if the rest of spain , the people of spain , do n't want to see spain split , is that not a legal and morally justified decision ? 
  what if i want to secede my house from america ? 
  do my neighbors get a say ? 
  my neighborhood ? 
  do my fellow city-dwellers get a say ? 
  my city ? 
  do my fellow county residents get a say ? 
  my county ? 
  do my fellow state citizens get a say ? 
  what if the [ single-person commune of rochefourchat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rochefourchat ) wants to secede ? 
  should he be allowed too ? 
  do the other citizens of the drome department get a say ? 
  you realize that this is on track to being one of the least productive congresses in history , with horrendous approval ratings and that this very same congress just about crashed the entire world economy last year by threatening a default * ( implicitly ) * ? 
  i mean ... have you missed the whole tea party thing going on ? 
  seriously man ... we have the highest incarceration rate in the world and are some of the fiercest advocaters of * `` state rights '' * ; our whole national identity is based around a federal government over a unitary one . 
  not to mention the prison-industrial complex and the fact we have one of the highest incarceration rates in the world , or shit , the occupy protests . 
  spain disintegrating weakens both the eu & nato , same with the united kingdom , italy & germany . 
  this goes against my country 's interests , and by extension , my interests , hence my opposition too it . 
  on a another note , the closest similarity would be the southwest attempting to secede , which i would oppose too . 
  because it weakens my country and my state . 
  i would n't even support my state seceding . 
  but i would support us throwing the british out if i lived during the revolution . 
  eh ... everybody gots different views i guess depending on what side of the fence they sit on . 
  well any catalan that thinks that is wrong in my opinion . 
  catalonia has autonomy that other regions * drool * over ; it 's like saying flanders has no say in belgium or bavaria no say in germany . 
  and people do care about the military . 
  sweden is presently shitting itself right now if you have n't noticed , and they 've always had that weird ass not-nato , but we 'll defend you like nato guarantee . 
  but what happens when the united states is n't around ? 
  when france and the united kingdom ca n't economically shoulder the entire defense burden of the continent ? 
  when the eu is still incapable of setting up a fully integrated and standing army capable of deploying without bureaucratic gangbanging ? 
  if you want a better life , than a strong military goes a long way . 
  hard power goes with soft power , it helps create the stability and security needed for the shit you want to actually happen . 
  i 'll be damned if the eu 's predecessor organizations , specifically the european atomic energy community and the european coal & steel community , would 've ever gotten off the ground without the implicit security guaranteed to it by the united states being in nato . 
  ** edit : ** ` shitting itself ' in regards to sweden is probably inaccurate , but calls by leading politicians to join nato and the fact that nordstream passes through the swedish economic zone thus posing a security/intelligence threat * ( russian warships now have a excuse to get closer to sweden , can tap the pipeline itself for intelligence ) * does paint a picture contradictory to your claim that sweden undervalues & ignores it 's military ... or better yet ... the military of it 's neighbors and allies . 
  an this is n't even touching upon the huge swedish arms business , which is one of the largest per capita in the world * ( i think only israel gives sweden competition here ) * . 
  eh , that 's fair and i can understand that . 
  but the day it happens , do n't ask why italy 's voice does n't mean shit in the eu or the international scene in general after venice and other northern states start getting on traction for independence . 
  same thing with scotland & the united kingdom or bavaria & germany . 
  why is it any different ? 
  or was italy a unified and centralized entity before the late 19th century ? 
  i mean shit ... when you think about it ... italian states have been independent longer than spanish states , spanish states have been under the aegis of the spanish government longer , united as a single nation for longer ... . why is it different ? 
  it 's not like you did n't have your own run-in with facism in the 20th century either . 
  you want to reduce yourselves from having the influence of texas to the influence of rhode island * ( lot less parliamentary seats for spain , lot more heads in the council to complicate shit for the rest of the eu members ) * . 
  you want to militarily cripple yourselves without any firm eu military set-up to defend you and your national interests ; effectively , you want to suck the united states , france & the united kingdom 's dick a little longer for a little more security because you 're unwilling and incapable of doing it yourself . 
  instead of embracing centuries of you being different autonomous states united under the aegis of a single country , instead of embracing your shared culture that defines your regional community , you want to focus on the evil and demonize it , tear it down . 
  you want to destroy something like that ? 
  ** lulz ** okay . 
  go for it . 
  shit , it 's better for my country , russia & china . 
  our influence grows at the * expense of * spain , other eu members ' influence decreases * because of * spain . 
  to be completely honest , there 's not a damn thing wrong with spain moving to prohibit a secession or a state-mandated referendum . 
  you are a autonomous state who is tied to spain constitutionally and spain is a unitary state which * devolves * power to you . 
  if you want revolution , and you ca n't get it through these means , fight for it ; and spain will fight you back . 
  and neither of you are technically more righteous than the other , because just like many modern-day states were founded by revolutions , many were also maintained through counter-revolutions * ( in a sense ) * . 
  or is the kingdom of bavaria & papal states still a thing ? 
  but anyway , yeah , great , keep doing what you 're doing ; it worked great for yugoslavia . 
  they do , but you guys have made some rather large cuts to your power projection , along with france , have n't you ? 
  i hate to say it , but you just lack the ability to rapidly and decisively respond to semi-advanced adversaries without the united states providing logistical , command & intelligence support . 
  libya proved this , syria proved this , russia will cement it should anything pop-off in the baltics . 
  any war with russia will be a limited , short engagement or a all-out nuclear war . 
  you might be as fucked as we are in a nuclear war , but for the shit that does n't involve nuclear holocaust , you just wo n't be able to respond to the situation like us . 
  and you could have the biggest dick in the world ; but it does n't mean shit if you do n't know how to use it or never even take it out your pants . 
  he wanted ukraine , but got crimea . 
  now if he does get ukraine through military force it alienates the european union and unites it , diminishes the fallout of the snowden 's leaks and thrusts nato into center-stage in importance ... all to a much larger degree than crimea caused ... which only goes to increase u.s. influence on the continent ... 
  who would 've thunked it ?!?!, 
  anti-eu nationalists supporting a anti-eu nationalist !?!,
