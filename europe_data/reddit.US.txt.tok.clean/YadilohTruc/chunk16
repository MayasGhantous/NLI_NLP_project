  and we 're talking about a * growing * china which will one day be able to compete with the united states , at least regionally , in the distant future . 
  the cia 's job is n't ' just to identity * present * threats to u.s. interests , it 's job is to also identify * future * threats . 
  remember , the chinese recovery of that downed f-117 * ( iirc ) * was one of the main causes for the scrapping/decommissioning of the entire fleet * ( not just a single fighter , but a entire fleet of stealth fighters , an possibly not just for china , but for their allies and anybody they share it with , including possibly the russians , even if they themselves are competitors with the russians ) * . 
  you said yourself in another thread that almost every russian or chinese jet to come out of either country has incorporated major design features , and technology in general , from u.s. aircraft . 
  i 'm not even saying it was official , and i * highly fucking doubt * the military in any way , shape or form knew what was going on , but i could definitely see a rouge cia operation being the cause to send a good * `` fuck you '' * to china through falsified coordinates handed to the military . 
  intelligence and spy work gets deep and weird and confusing . 
  an i never said these ideas were anything more than a theory . 
  ** edit : also , i might be watching too much of fx 's `` the americans '' **, 
  no , i was just suggesting it was more of a rouge * `` fuck you '' * cia operation because of china 's own intelligence operations in the region , without the knowledge of the military * ( by feeding false coordinates ) * . 
  ** edit : ** and embassies actually do handle and transmit a shit load of intelligence * ( illegally gathered as well ) * from their host country , they 're usually the main center for such , as counter-intuitive as that sounds . 
  i agree with the intervention in the balkans , and find things like the destruction of bridges being a war crime to be ridiculous ... but that chinese shit gets weird ... . 
  this is around the same time that china sent a bunch of intelligence operatives to the balkans to pick up pieces of a downed f-117 nighthawk * ( which later rendered it obsolete , forcing us to scrap/decommission them ) * ... and the cia is a bunch of dicks ... so i would n't be surprised if this was some under the table type intelligence warfare shit . 
  even if the military did n't know what they were doing and did n't know it was the chinese embassy , i could totally see the cia feeding them false coordinates . 
  how is sweden * `` officially '' * neutral when , as i pointed out above , they involved themselves in conflicts like the balkans , afghanistan , libya and car ? 
  when they are considering sending troops to mali ? 
  when they are apart of the eu 's common defense & security * ( is that the right name ? 
  ) * policy and participate in a eu battlegroup ? 
  how does a country pride itself on low military spending when they 're one of the largest arms exporters in the world per capita * ( i actually would n't be surprised if they were the largest by this metric , but israel is probably in a heated contest with them in that regard ) * ? 
  except when it comes to the balkans , afghanistan , libya or car * ( and possibly mali given that sweden is considering sending troops ) * . 
  or the european union 's common defense & security agreement ... or the associated eu battlegroups ... 
  well ... yeah ... but let 's look what gandhi has to say about the british & jews during wwii . 
  ** gandhi to every briton **  i want you to fight nazism without arms , or , if i am to retain the military terminology , with non-violent arms . 
  i would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity . 
  you will invite herr hitler and signor mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions . 
  let them take possession of your beautiful island , with your many beautiful buildings . 
  you will give all these , but neither your souls , nor your minds . 
  if these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes , you will vacate them . 
  if they do not give you free passage out , ** you will allow yourself , man , woman and child , to be slaughtered ** , but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them . 
  ** gandhi to jews in nazi germany **  hitler killed five million jews . 
  it is the greatest crime of our time . 
  but ** the jews should have offered themselves to the butcher 's knife . 
  ** they should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs . 
  as it is , they succumbed anyway in their millions . 
  now ... call me crazy ... but this seems like a horrible idea ... and in the case of the jews ... exactly what hitler wanted ... 
  i never said they were . 
  very true and i agree . 
  yes , but these things came to a head in the mid-90s . 
  russia was against it , but even by then they had given up on any hope of stopping eastward nato expansion . 
  [ case in point ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/summit/summit.htm )  what had seemed likely to be an incremental summit , bogged down by the seemingly endless dispute over the future of nato , ended up offering the promise of unanticipated progress in a number of areas -- although many obstacles remain before all that promise is realized . 
   ** after months of bitterly opposing nato 's eastward expansion , yeltsin indicated today that he no longer entertains any realistic hope of halting it . 
  ** now , he said , his aim is to `` minimize the negative consequences '' for russia . 
   yeltsin blasted the idea once again , calling it `` a mistake , and a serious one at that . '', 
  but in the negotiations ** he accepted a formula under which russia would live with a nato that included several former soviet satellite states ** -- and then , rather than use his leverage on other issues to press clinton on nato , he went on to hold substantive discussions on a range of matters , most notably arms control . 
  i can understand russian animosity , i really can , but comparing this to the budapest memorandum is wrong and misleading .

  but there was n't any contract that can compare to the budapest memorandum in this regard . 
  it was more of a unspoken agreement if anything . 
  to quote the [ ** `` foundations of geopolitics '' ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) , a book used as a textbook by the general staff academy of the russian military :  ukraine should be annexed by russia because `` ukraine as an independent state with certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of eurasia and , without resolving the ukrainian problem , it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics '' . 
  ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent , unless it is cordon sanitaire , which would be inadmissible . 
  fuckers should n't of collapsed then . 
  ** edit : ** but let 's not fool ourselves into thinking that was the cause for crimea & ukraine . 
  this was a long time coming .

  agreed on that . 
  i 've said before in this subreddit , ** dragnet surveillance is wrong and immoral ** and should not be undertaken under any circumstances . 
  but ** spying on governments and their leaders is legitimate ** . 
  that 's my stance on the issue . 
  if germany spied on obama , there 'd be nothing wrong with that , but if germany spied on me , i 'd be pissed , so i understand the grievances associated with that . 
  so no , as far as spying on government agencies and leaders , i really do not care if it violates national law . 
  all spying inevitably does . 
  if you do n't want this , there must be a treaty established and ratified by both our legislatures specifically forbidding such and more than likely allowing the sharing of information of other countries we spied on * ( which ... incidentally ... merkel most likely wanted when she tried to push germany 's bid to join 5 eyes following the snowden leaks ) * . 
  the pre-coditions for such a treaty is that we trust each other , which at the moment , i do n't think we do trust germany like we trust the united kingdom . 
   i 'm not promoting isolationism . 
  i 'm promoting interacting with each other on common terms without the use of ( the threat of ) violence . 
  which is a admirable goal which you should without a doubt pursue . 
  there is * nothing * wrong with this idealism . 
  i just would like to venture that the united nations is a rather ineffective and inefficient institution despite being founded on these principles . 
   why is the balance between peace and violence ( war ? ), 
  better than just plain peace ? 
  because not everyone plays by your rules . 
  peace and a soft-power approach is great when everybody does the same , but as soon as somebody whips their dick out and starts using their hard power the dynamic goes out the window . 
   i do n't think peace and liberty are uniquely western values . 
  i think they are universal human values when people are not living in fear . 
  or do you mean something else by `` western values '' ? 
  no , they 're not , but i am a fan of locke , voltaire , paine , etc. 
  and the other influential thinkers which inspired both the american & french revolutions , so my view might be bias . 
   if people see that the current boss ( usa ) is playing a fair game and promoting common good they will start leaning towards the view that we are all friends and in this together . 
  however , if they see those with the power use it to exploit others for selfish reasons , they will start to think that that 's the name of the game and this will cause balance of power to shift towards those people who do n't care about playing nice . 
  it is up to the ones who currently hold the power to decide which way it will go and that can only be done by showing example . 
  * `` with great power comes great responsibility . 
  '' * you have a very real and good point here that should be recognized and adhered to by american politicians and leaders . 
  we must lead by example when we can , but at the same time , i also contend we must make hard decisions for the very same reasons . 
  great responsibility is more than meets the eye . 
  every prominent person or leader must make hard decisions , perhaps unpopular decisions , but necessary decisions none-the-less . 
  no , i do n't believe any country does anything for non-selfish reasons , not even isolationist ones like switzerland or de-militarized ones like costa rica . 
  but i do believe it 's for the greater good , even if it 's main motivation is to further the national interests of the united states . 
  i believe it provides a more stable international environment through * pax americana * and has the intended side-effect of spreading western values * ( as well as english and the u.s. dollar which is the world 's reserve currency , an conformity and proliferation of a single lingua franca has always had a stabilizing effect in history ) * . 
  you can disagree with that , and i understand if you do , but that 's my personal opinion . 
  you said international law , not german law . 
  there is no * `` no-spy agreement '' * or one akin to * `` five eyes '' * existent between the united states and germany . 
  i was using that figuratively . 
  if you find figurative language offensive , i suggest you do n't frequent message boards on the internet . 
  i will continue to use the term figuratively and if that offends you i apologize . 
  ** edit : ** kinda was a dick here and wan na apologize ... got ta remember english is n't the 1st language of many here ... . and i 'm a dick on a lot of things , but this is one thing i should n't of been a dick on and i feel legitimately sorry about . 
  sorry dude .
