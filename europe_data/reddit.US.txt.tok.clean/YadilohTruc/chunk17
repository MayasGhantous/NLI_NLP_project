  the fact that [ gerhard schroder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerhard_schr%c3%b6der#gazprom ) now chairs the company that is building nordstream ... which was signed in the closing days of his administration ... where the german government agreed to cover 1 billion euros . 
  perhaps , and no , i do n't think iraq was justified . 
  not from a realpolitik perspective . 
  you could make a moral argument based on the mistreatment of kurds and just the general oppression of saddam , but in my opinion it was a mistake . 
  it fucked the intervention in afghanistan , was conducted under the wrong * casus belli * and had no proper exit strategy formulated . 
  i believe treaties and conventions ratified by your country 's legislature should be respected and upheld . 
  all other relationships are determined by the rule of strongest , whether by hard or soft power , and your own country adheres to this same principle , i guarantee you , even if you do n't believe me . 
  because , the world is not a fairy tale and we can not just do drugs and fuck and party all day . 
  i would love that , i would , but it 's not going to happen . 
  and isolationism wo n't work , because sticking your fingers in your ears and closing your eyes does n't make reality go away . 
  and if it was n't for the warhawks than pacifists like yourself would outnumber the moderates like myself ... but if it was n't for the pacifists we would be outnumbered by warhawks ... it 's a good balance . 
  anyway , yes , i think it 's for the greater good that american hegemony exists , i believe it helps solidify and spread western values across the world , even at a moral cost like supporting shit like the house of saud or playing proxy war with russia in syria or ukraine . 
  you can not have justice without a strong hand . 
  and without justice you can not have peace . 
  you ever wonder why the middle east is how it is after decolonization and the fall of the ottoman empire ? 
  every wonder why a shit-load of states in europe popped up and started slaughtering the shit out of each other after the roman empire fell ? 
  but it does n't matter , we wo n't remain super power forever so that dream will crash down . 
  china and the others will rise , and america will switch from being boss to `` first-amongst-equals '' . 
  we 'll always been a great power , and the strongest among them for at least a century , but meh . 
  an even if we play nice , i really do n't think china , russia nor brazil will play nice , hell , i doubt the eu will play nice , so back to square one . 
  having to play the same game as everybody else to get by and retain your precedence . 
  if you want to see change on a global scale , convince the unsc to let the unga to pass legally binding resolutions . 
  south africa ? 
  it might not have caused the transition , but it sure as hell helped . 
  why ? 
  i agree , this really is a great article . 
  though i kinda warn against the use of the term machiavellian ; it 's not wrong , and you 're absolutely correct in using it , but people will get the wrong idea . 
  all international relations , in my opinion , are * guided * by morals , but at the same time they 're * dictated * by national interests ... if that makes sense ... and ** all countries ** play by these rules . 
  realpolitiks rules the day in international relationships . 
  that 's just my personal view , but yeah , definitely a great article . 
  i would n't really consider israel a shitty person * ( figuratively speaking ) * on the same level as assad or saudi arabia . 
  they 've done some fucked up shit , but you have to look at the circumstances surrounding them , and unlike either syria or saudi arabia , which faced similar circumstances * ( which is why i can excuse some things ) * they 've maintained a representative democracy that , whether people like to admit it or not , does tend to uphold western values and such for the citizens . 
  a lot of shit needs to change with israel , but they 're incomparable to either assad or saud . 
  and syria has always been the epicentre of hostility ever since decolonization . 
  that picture does n't really go to prove otherwise . 
  it 's just the official representative of one nation meeting the official leader of another nation in a public setting . 
  syria is a big country , it 's wealthiest and most secure areas are not equivalent to the other regions in the country . 
  also , just for the record , syrian ba'athists are * way different * than iraqi ba'athists ... like ... go to war with each other type different . 
  [ look at this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/various_arabic_troops_during_operation_desert_storm.jpg ) . 
  those are syrian soldiers during the first gulf war . 
   an hezbollah will be just as moderate as it was before ; not at all . 
  if anything it 'll just * soften * it 's image more , now that it 's supply line to iran is gone and their ally in assad is gone , so they have to interact more with christians and others . 
  propaganda will be the same as it always was ; sunni are evil , shia are evil , jews are evil , christians are evil , russians are evil , americans are evil , arabs are evil , persians are evil . 
  it was like that before we came , it 'll be like that after we leave , unless , amazingly , some super-strong neo-ottoman state rises to ensure order/stability/tolerance or all the middle eastern states put their differences aside and join some kind of intergovernmental confederacy like the eu * ( with much more integration and a strong stick , with a willingness to use it , to keep member-states in line ) * . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  we have the [ ukusa agreement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukusa_agreement ) , otherwise known as [ `` five eyes '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_eyes ) . 
  it 's generally agreed that they do n't spy on each other . 
  in fact , merkel 's bid for a no-spy treaty , in my opinion , was less about a no-spy agreement and mostly about getting into that juicy little information group . 
  that said , we just do n't trust germany . 
  which is n't that surprising given schroeder * ( whom the spying started with ) * and gazprom with nordstream , which not only posed a security/intelligence threat to a major non-nato ally in sweden , but also threatened to economically isolate vital nato allies like poland * ( russia can now cut off gas to them without cutting off gas to the rest of western europe ) * . 
  why would they give it to her ? 
  do intelligence agencies usually make a habit of giving out their files on foreign governments and leaders * to * those foreign governments and leaders when the intelligence was n't collected in cooperation with them ? 
  it 's good headline bait , but nothing more . 
  because washington does n't trust germany . 
  ever since shroeder and gazprom i think that u.s. government has been a little uneasy about germany 's relationship with russia , as well as it 's adherence to the united states hegemony and accepting of the united states ' own interests . 
  you might ask , why should the united states oppose germany pursuing it 's own interests outside of the united states ? 
  because those interests , as we see with the gazprom deal , can be contradictory and endangering to our interests and our allies interests * ( poland and estonia specifically ) * . 
  than you might ask , why should the united states care if germany moves against it 's influence ? 
  because that makes germany a competitor . 
  germany is free to do as it wants ; it 's a sovereign nation . 
  it 's not a satellite state of the united states . 
  but do n't act surprised when the united states * treats you like a sovereign nation * and a * equal * . 
  if you were our bitch we would n't need to do this . 
  militarily , we 're there for you , we are , the troops stationed there and nato go to prove that , but when you start doing under-the-table shit to undermine us , do n't be surprised when we do under-the-table shit in response . 
  those are the exact reasons why i see them as the bigger threat . 
  and them accepting secularism , in my mind , is less them being accepting and more them being * calculating * because unlike the idiots in al-qaeda they know they ca n't survive in 35-40 % christian lebanon if they go about shouting for a islamic republic . 
  there are no doubts in my mind that hezbollah wishes to establish a theocracy in lebanon , they just do n't go about it waving their dick in the air shouting it to the sky like al-qaeda and it 's caliphate . 
  and i can understand your line of thought . 
  it 's the same line of thought the west uses for saudi arabia and the gulf allies . 
  but the difference is ; i 'm american , not russian . 
  it 's fucked up that i say it like that , but it 's the truth , us and russia are competitors in the region ; simple as that . 
  if we have two really shitty people in the room , i 'm going to pick my shitty person over yours . 
  an if the west wanted to strike assad and get rid of that russian base while the opposition still had integrity , they should have done it in the first months of the war , not after the first year . 
  there 's nothing to do now . 
  we ca n't strike without flooding * ( more so than now ) * a country neighboring israel * ( and not that far away from europe ) * with islamic terrorists who do n't have a centralized authority or any sort of stability * ( and who ar n't distracted by fighting those things either ) * . 
  at least with hezbollah , iran & assad you have * somebody * calling the shots and instituting order , but without them , it 's just chaos , and i do n't think israel wants that on their border . 
  there 's nothing left to do with syria than to let it grind to a halt and fizzle itself out ... which could takes years ... maybe a decade or more ... but that 's what we get for not being decisive in the opening stages of the conflict . 
  true , that 's your opinion and i respect it ; we need pacifists like we need warhawks * ( i.e. 
  mccain is my example here ) * . 
  helps balance out the discussion . 
  personally ? 
  i find myself in the middle . 
  i like to think of myself as practical ; morally guided , but understanding at the same time you have to compromise parts of your morality for the greater good . 
  and furthering the national interests of the united states , maintaining it 's global hegemony * ( or at least extending our precedence among other great powers in the distant future when we get to that point ) * , is , ** in my opinion ** , for the greater good . 
  perhaps it 's immature ; perhaps i 'm substituting * `` the white man 's burden '' * for * `` america 's burden '' * , i do n't know , but i do honestly believe that a american-led hegemony and * pax americana * is best for the world in the long-run . 
  as for 9/11 ? 
  i believe the intervention in afghanistan was the right choice and the opening stages of the conflict were carried out masterfully * ( we tore down the taliban with a couple hundred special forces helping coordinate and assist northern alliance offensives ) * . 
  but than we got distracted by bush 's foray into iraq , put afghanistan on the backburner , and all the hard-fought advances we made was slowly eroded as more and more resources were diverted away to battle the insurgency in iraq . 
  not to mention the public opinion fucking windfall and damage to our credibility . 
  hypothetical canada , sorry about that . 
  personally , i do n't agree with hezbollah , and i sure as fuck do n't want to see them expand their influence in lebanon & syria , but i must admit i begrudgingly respect them . 
  the fact of the matter is , * they 're not * al-qaeda or al-nusra , they 're a completely different beast . 
  israel is the most competent , well-trained and effective military force on the planet * ( in my opinion ) * , so you 're going to need the most competent , well-trained and effective guerrilla group on the planet to go toe-to-toe with them ... which hezbollah did . 
  an a lot of that probably comes from the fuck tonne of cash that iran threw at them in their formative years , and more importantly , the iranian republican guard special forces that trained them * ( many of whom were experienced combat veterans who saw fighting in the iran-iraq war ) * . 
  they 're also smart . 
  they know not to push their claim in lebanon because they 're not strong enough yet ; of course they want a islamic republic of lebanon , but they 're patient and willing to gather their strength ; their moves are calculated . 
  al-qaeda and al-nusra ar n't ; right off the bat they call all governments in iraq & the levant as illegitimate and are immediately trying to set-up a caliphate . 
  hezbollah 's organization in itself is also impeccable . 
  very secretive * ( the paramilitary side , not the political side at least ) * . 
  fighters and officers go to great lengths to keep their involvement in the organization secret ; i remember reading a story that a girl did n't realize her own brother was in the organization until he died and the organization came and told her .
