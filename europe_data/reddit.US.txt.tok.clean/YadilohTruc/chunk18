  other groups are much more flashy and braggish . 
  this is a necessity for hezbollah though , because their main opponent is israel , unlike the others , and as you may know , mossad is one of the most effective and successful intelligence agencies on the planet * ( israel really is amazing for how much it punches above it 's weight , hell , i would say that most of hezbollah 's skill comes not from itself , but from having to constantly adapt to israel 's successful and effective tactics ... while still surviving and remaining intact/functional ... if that makes sense ) * . 
  but they lost any credibility as a legitimate political group from me the day they abandoned their stance on suicide bombings against civilians * ( they had previously opposed it , but than allowed it after a bombing against israeli civilians ) * . 
  though ... it 's a double-edged sword ... i respect them more ... but for that same reason i see them as * a lot bigger threat * than any of the other islamic terrorist groups . 
  yeah , i 'm actually hoping with russia and china growing * ( and the united states becoming less reliant on oil ) * that iran is gon na pull a vietnam and use america as a deterrent against both . 
  it sounds unlikely , but so was vietnam looking to expand military relationships with us two decades ago . 
  always had a soft spot for persian culture and society ; but that might just be derived from my admiration of classical civilization and the role it played there . 
  that said , i also believe coming down on iran like a hammer over nuclear weapons is also vital . 
  we already have israelis , pakis and indians all with loaded guns pointed at each other , the last thing we need is iranians and saudis with guns pointed at each other . 
  an all it takes is one bullet for all them to shoot each other by chain reaction ... and then if they all shoot each other than russia and china will probably shoot * ( do n't know where the missiles are going , just know they 're being launched ) * ... and if they shoot than america and nato will definitely shoot ... and then we 're in a nuclear holocaust . 
  anybody who thinks proliferation of nuclear weapons in the ** middle east ** as a good idea is a fucking idiot . 
  because they 're not aligned with the west . 
  bad guys is n't a good description when discussing international relationships . 
  morality guides the process , but national interests will always dictate it . 
  i know what side of the chessboard i fall on , so i know who i support ; i criticize them , and i believe morality should be the guiding factor , but i also understand that national interests are important and it is not practical , nor possible , to satisfy both . 
  so you must find a balance . 
  we 're effectively piggybacking and spreading western values through exploitation of autocratic and oppressive middle eastern countries . 
  is it wrong ? 
  yeah . 
  will it be beneficial to the future ? 
  i think so . 
  it would be great if we could all hold hands and dance around the camp fire , but that wo n't happen , and isolationism is n't going to make it come any sooner , in fact , it 'll probably do the opposite since you give others without the moral restraint of yourself to move freely . 
  but that 's my opinion . 
  way too many people see the world as black-and-white when in reality it 's shades of grey . 
  fucked up ? 
  yes . 
  reality ? 
  absolutely . 
  * 22.5 million google hits * is not twice the number of * 50 million google hits * . 
  i mean , you ca n't objectively compare a country half-the-population or less of the united states on absolute terms with it . 
  that 's unfair , hence why we use * per 100,000 * or * per capita * in so many studies . 
  so to keep it fair , we have to compare by population * ( especially since this is a eu police mission , not a single country 's eu mission ) * . 
  and keep in mind , that at the same time , google probably has a larger database of english results for english countries than it does foreign results . 
  it has a economy the size of the united kingdom yet a population 1/6th of india , and unlike south korea or the united kingdom , it has a shit load of room to expand within it 's own country and a shit load of resources to fuel that growth . 
  they 're like russia , small economy and population ( relative to their size ) , but just a huge amounts of land and resources to expand . 
  south korea is kinda ... just penned in ... an even if the peninsula does reunite , i just do n't see them becoming a great power , but instead just being a very influential regional power , like japan . 
  of course this is just my armchair expert 's opinion , so you might want to take it with a grain of salt .

  mind you , this is n't the misleading metric i wanted to use , it 's the misleading metric you told me to use . 
  yeah , my apologies if i came off to harsh looking back i kinda acted like a dick . 
  no , but he 's comparing it specifically to the united kingdom , a single state , but if we 're talking about the european union as a whole it 's fair we include comparisons with other countries to determine acceptability . 
  i mean we 're not talking about acceptance into the * commonwealth * , we 're talking about acceptance into the * european union * . 
  and i never said switzerland was n't part of the eu , i only said i doubt that the european union would deny them based on their healthcare system , which the american one is modeled on . 
  i literally pointed this out in the comment . 
  this is ** great ** . 
  but how does it effect the fra law and titan traffic database ? 
  did the european court rule the practice as illegal , or simply the requirement to do so as illegal ? 
  i mean , private companies getting rid of it is good , but what about government agencies ? 
  you 're on pussy . 
  we 're about to tie-break this bitch after 1812 . 
  yeah , lol , i guess it does n't help my argument that i just typoed british as canadian . 
  i do n't think china is on the path to becoming a super power , just on a path to become a great power * ( which it arguably already is ) * . 
  i also believe russia is a great power , but one to much less degree than china . 
  this is also why america will stop being a super power , not because of it loosing it 's influence , but because of other 's gaining influence * ( if that makes sense ) * . 
  in my opinion , the future world will not be a unipolar one * ( with china or america undisputaly at the top ) * nor a bipolar one * ( soviet union/america or china/america ) * , but instead a multi-polar one , made up of america , china , russia , the european union * ( if it integrates ) * and brazil as great powers , with south africa * ( maybe nigeria instead or in addition to ) * and india coming up from behind . 
  i also think america will retain precedence among this group at first-among-equals * ( figuratively , not literally ) * for around a century before china can really usurp us . 
  ** but russia is still in this group . 
  ** so it should not be underestimated either . 
   as long as both governments keep on insisting that there is only one china ( with them as the top ) this is as good as it gets . 
  actually , it gets worse if that does n't happen . 
  china does n't fear taiwan saying it 's the * rightful leader * of china , it fears taiwan saying * it 's not china * . 
  it fears a independent taiwan , not a exile chinese government , because once a independent taiwan gets on the picture instead of a government-in-exile , china loses all claim to taiwan . 
  iirc , this was the essence of the taiwan strait crisis in the 90s . 
  a taiwan that forfeits it 's claim to china also forfeits china 's claim to taiwan . 
  ** edit : ** which is rather ironic ... because it 's effectively china holding a gun to taiwan 's head telling them to point a gun at china 's head or else china will shoot ... 
  i pointed out above , even if china did all that , i still doubt it would * ever * integrate into the us/european sphere . 
  china is on a path of it 's own and desires it 's own hegemony . 
  much like how many want to see the european union integrate more so it removes itself from american hegemony . 
  it 's not going to choose between russia and the west , it 's going to chose itself . 
  china is on a rise of it 's own . 
  it 's not going to side with russia , not because it wants to side with us/europe , but because it wants to side with itself . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that , but people need to understand it to understand china . 
  i feel the same way bud , the same way . 
  you know that most of the whites fighting for the confederacy were scottish who 's ancestors were came or were sent here by the united kingdom * ( georgia , for one , was a penal colony ) * ? 
  and do n't get me started on the de-population of the east coast of native americans . 
  most of the problems in my life i usually blame on the british . 
  the sentiment is reflected . 
  yeah ... sure ... if you consider them going from the largest economies in the world to not even being in the top ten following the boxer rebellion * ( and one of the poorest overall ) * ... than yeah ... * quite well * is a apt description . 
  and it 's weird ... china 's extraordinary growth and rise to the 2nd largest economy strangely correlates with them getting their shit back together and actually engaging the region/world with strong relationships * ala * what the united states is doing . 
  yeah , but switzerland does the same , and most of us would consider them a type of isolationist . 
  and america definately did all of that before the spanish-american war , wwi and wwii but many still consider much of the time before that and in-between them as isolationist . 
  perhaps you 're right , and i apologize , but the term is not as far-fetched as it 's made out to be . 
  exactly my point . 
  and look what happened to them in the end . 
  even before the opium wars , their influence was being chipped away and society made unstable by european soft power in the region . 
  the opium wars was just the result of two centuries of european soft power coming to a head , and the boxer rebellion was the death knell which was only made possible by those previous events . 
  i oppose that because it weakens united states influence on the global scene and with major trading partners . 
  i 've said multiple times before that i oppose that and believe it 's not in the national interests of our country ; and by extension , the interests of us . 
  we need to reform a lot of legislation , do n't get wrong , so we see that benefit is more aptly received by us , but in my personal opinion , after those reforms come * ( if we can make america isolationist like you think we can than we sure as fuck can do this to ) * , these strong international relationships are more of a benefit than a liability . 
  i honestly and truthfully believe that . 
  no , you see , ** this is impossible ** . 
  i 've been told , time and time again , that multi-party parliamentary democracies with proportional voting are * absolutely immune * to gerrymandering and shady campaign finance laws/advertising . 
  and that they would in no way devolve into two major parties controlling much of the discourse , as such never happens in countries like the united kingdom . 
  that 's why all those problems would magically disappear if we applied such a set-up to america . 
  well , thank god europe has nordstream so this does n't effect them as much . 
  i mean ... can you imagine that ? 
  being effected by russia using gazprom as a political weapon ? 
  now you 're putting words in my mouth ; do n't do that . 
  i completely disagree with american laws which have caused the present situation , but ** european law enforcement ** in general is n't that different from the united states it 's the ** european laws ** that are different . 
  and i doubt the british and polish are going to go over there and teach ukrainian law enforcement to enforce british/polish laws .
