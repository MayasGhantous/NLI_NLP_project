  why ca n't america send the law enforcement of it 's best states like the eu is doing if we do go * ( which i do n't think we should ) * . 
  sending the lapd and deep south law enforcement agencies is no different than the eu sending italy and mostly eastern european law enforcement agencies . 
  i do n't agree with the war on drugs * ( or the prohibition of even hard drugs like cocaine & heroin , i think the money could be better used for state-funded rehab centers opened to those who want to help themselves , so they have the resources necessary to do so , and so drug money wo n't be dirty and can be re-invested into the community/economy ) * or the present prison system * ( not all states allow fucked up private companies to maintain their jails ... those cunts ... but federal legislation should still prohibit it ) * , but you 're failure to recognize the underlying cause of the situation or be able to neutrally compare the law enforcement agencies in question makes me wonder of your own understanding of the situation in it 's entirety . 
  so you can disregard the entire united states based on the lapd and nypd , but i ca n't do the same for the european union based on a entire member-state and the second-largest city in france ? 
  you ever think that , that thought process in general is a bad way of going about things ? 
  ever heard of italy 's [ cheif-of-police ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/italys-police-chief-named-in-corruption-investigation-1405883.html ) or [ marseilles pd ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9594587/marseille-police-corruption-scandal-deepens-as-30-officers-suspended.html ) ? 
  the prison-industrial complex is fucked up and needs to change ; the philosophy of our prison system in general needs to change , but our law enforcement in itself is just as efficient and corruption-free as it 's comparable european law enforcement agencies . 
  there 's a difference between the [ courts ] ( http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/italy/120319/italian-judges-arrested-suspected-ties-the-mafia-camorra ) and law enforcement . 
  i do n't think america should join this mission for the same reason you do ; that ukraine should be integrating with the eu , not the west or international community * ( i.e. 
  interpol ) * in general . 
  but do n't sit here and pass superficial bullshit as fact . 
  that 's fair , but i still do n't believe that canada is compatible with the european union , perhaps more so than the united states , but not enough to be on the same level as estonia , spain or the united kingdom . 
  and i do n't wish for a european union of america , i which for a north american union with canada . 
  chinese hegemony in the region, 
  because we picked up their defense following the collapse of the british empire and have committed to them ever since , including through-out the turbulent cold war period * ( i think you 're forgetting that a major russian attack could , and very well probably would , come across the arctic through canadian airspace ... so strategically a strong relationship in the fashion we have now is also in our favor ) * . 
  we 'd still probably have good relations with canada , but not nearly at the same level we have now , that 's for damn sure . 
  and you ever wonder why the united states has such absolutely * extreme * global influence ? 
  it 's * because of those defense treaties * . 
  you 'd have to be a fool not to realize the foreign influence and leverage they buy us , and this , in my opinion , is beneficial to american citizens . 
  i ca n't help , but draw a comparison between a modern-day isolationist united states and a medieval-day isolationist china . 
  an shit did n't work out good for china . 
  and a number of strong allies . 
  how so ? 
  how is america any less efficient and corrupt * ( italy , [ france ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9594587/marseille-police-corruption-scandal-deepens-as-30-officers-suspended.html ) and eastern european countries would like a word ) * than these european police agencies ? 
  what fucks us is our war on drugs * ( which many european countries are also embroiled in ) * and centuries of disenfranchisement of minorities , which is beginning to change * ( if you have n't seen our president or some of the leaders of even the tea party ) * . 
  and it 's not like [ europe does n't discriminate on race/ethnicity either ] ( http://stopandfriskinfo.org/international/reducing-ethnic-profiling-in-the-european-union-2012/ ) , especially in regards to turks , arabs and gypsies . 
  i 'd also venture religion plays a role with muslims . 
  and how do we not uphold civil rights ? 
  do we not respect freedom of speech/expression to a larger degree , even if you do n't agree with that and think we should have hate speech laws ? 
  do we not respect gun rights even if you do n't agree with them ? 
  and it 's just as hard , if not harder , for a american police agency to get a warrant in america as it is for [ a european one ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/how_they_do_it/2006/02/wiretapping_europeanstyle.html ) . 
  and while the actions of the nsa and european goverments in relation to dragnet surveillance is ** disgusting and immoral , as well as probably illegal ** , no american police agency has the same level of surveillance available to them as a [ british one ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10172298/one-surveillance-camera-for-every-11-people-in-britain-says-cctv-survey.html ) do n't get me wrong , the increased militarization of our police forces is troubling and i take a firm stance against it , but how is that different than [ european gendamaries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_gendarmerie_force ) , especially [ france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_gendarmerie ) ? 
  [ an it 's not like european countries do n't have a form of stop-and-frisk ] ( https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_defendants_in_criminal_proceedings_-169-ni-maximizems-en.do?clang=en&amp;idsubpage=2 ) . 
  ** tl ; dr america needs to change a lot of shit , but saying we are a corrupt , inefficient mess in comparison to europe is not only a false comparison but a straight lie **, 
  this actually surprises me a lot , but i really should n't of after they let rwanda and mozambique in * ( though i was under the impression that both had adapted the queen to be head-of-state , but i might be wrong ) * . 
  always thought the queen was the one thing that tied them all together . 
  texafornia york works too . 
  lol, 
  we might not have bad relations , but we wo n't have the strong relations we have now , and i do n't think canada would be * nearly * as friendly to us if we did n't help protect them . 
  we 've basically took over the role of the united kingdom for them and australia ever since the fall of the british empire . 
  you might like that scenario , but i sure as hell do n't . 
  to quote lamar off gta v , * `` big dog , big nuts . 
  if there 's a name on the board i want it to be mine . 
  '' * so , i guess we kinda just have to agree to disagree . 
  yeah ... kinda ... but than some other dick would be us . 
  and i do n't want some other dick to be us . 
  i like us being the world 's dick . 
  good point . 
  and that 's exactly where it should start . 
  a common currency , open borders and free movement . 
  but than we 'd have to ensure we have a strong fiscal union as well so we do n't end up like europe which ... makes things very confusing ... as we 've seen in the eurozone . 
  ** edit : past this is my theory of how to do it without that complicated extra layer of government that you pointed out ** but i still want it to happen . 
  convincing america to dissolve it 's goverment for a new north american government would n't has a snow ball 's chance in hell ... and convincing mexico or canada to join the united states is just as far-fetched * ( no offense , but much of canadian identity seems to revolve around the fact of not being american ... which in my personal experience with canadians seems to be a very touchy subject when bringing up the similarities between our two countries ... but this is just from my limited experiences ) * although , ** personally ** , i think it 'd be easier convincing your country and mexico to join the united states with the motivation of transforming the country into something completely different through your new-found influence in the legislature * ( you 'd get like 16 senators and mexico a shitload of representatives ... probably twice as many senators as you too ... which poses a whole new set of problems bah ) * ... but like i mentioned above about how prideful canadians are about * not * being america ... it 's ugh ... not that much more likely of a solution in relation to america dissolving it 's government ... ** edit2 : and perhaps it 'd work better if we combined multiple american states into single states , like making new england into a state and like north/south carolina into a state and such ; to give canada a little more influence in the senate to balance things out . 
  you know , [ fallout ] ( http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/united_states#the_american_commonwealths ) - type shit ... but with a peaceful annexation of you instead of a military annexation lol **, 
  yeah , but as long as nuclear missiles are in the equation it 's a gamble * we have to take * . 
  it 's less of a choice and more of a necessity . 
  if america 's mad strategy with nato is torn apart , than what else follows ? 
  how about our pivot to the pacific ? 
  how about our relations with canada if we ca n't be trusted to help them protect their arctic territories from russia ? 
  maybe , maybe not , but it 'd effectively render america a non-factor on the world stage . 
  some people may prefer a pre-1900s american foreign policy * ( or pre-1940s if you consider wwi a fluke ) * , but i sure as hell do n't . 
  plus it would completely fuck america 's * `` pivot to the pacific/asia '' * . 
  why would japan , south korea , singapore and australia trust us after this ? 
  ~ ~ this is dangerous and personally i 'm not sure if it 's a good idea , but if you guys go in , america should go to . ~ ~ should have read the article , i 'm a fucking idiot and should be mocked for one . 
  in this case , america should n't contribute , not because of quality or competence , but because ukraine is looking at a future of more integration with the european union , not america . 
  you mean ... spying on the government which built a pipeline directly to russia which could economically-isolate vital american nato allies in eastern europe and which might pose a security/intelligence threat to a major non-nato ally in sweden ? 
  dragnet surveillance against european civilians ** is wrong ** , morally , it 's as fucked up as spying on american citizens without a warrant , but spying on * government leaders * ? 
  that 's legitimate spying . 
  oh ... eu trade representatives have something against switzerland dodging free movement agreement ? 
  who would have thought ?!, 
  it 's not the motivation , it 's what 's being done , which may violate a treaty . 
  how is this any different from a legal perspective then the economic pressure that the eu put on switzerland ? 
  not defending him , but the russian federation * is * considered the successor state of the soviet union . 
  i still want to pursue a north american union , and i personally oppose canada ever joining the european union . 
  there 's nothing wrong to dream of my continent one day having a integrated economy , single currency and free movement . 
  and i 'm sure that 's a dream you can relate too . 
  i want my continent to have a integrated economy , free movment and a single currency . 
  why is that dream wrong ? 
  ~ ~ is it not the same one you have ? ~ ~ an who 's to say a north american union has to be a confederacy or intergovernmental ? 
  why ca n't it be supranational ? 
  why ca n't we have a north american house of representatives and a north american senate ? 
  mexico and the united states would dominate the lower house , but canada would have a large voice in the senate , much more so than luxembourg or ireland do in the european union . 
  and if we 're all one entirety , much of northern usa is very similar to canada politically and culturally , thus increasing the canadian-leaning voting bloc , an the same goes for mexico and the american southwest . 
  the european union ** as it is today ** was unthinkable 20-30 years ago . 
  why is a north american union impossible in retrospect ? 
  ** edit : did n't realize you were canadian man , sorry , lol , crossed out the above assumption , but it still looks like you have the same dream anyway which is pretty cool **, 
  why you guys trying to fuck up our north american union ? 
  lol, 
  how you gon na forget us ? 
  we 're coming too you bastards . 
  lol, 
  exactly , and canada does n't have representation at westminister nor is it governed from there . 
  the united states shares the common law system of the united kingdom . 
  we have a healthcare system modeled on switzerland * ( and i doubt you 'd deny them ) * . 
  our military willingness is comparable to that of france . 
  we have no official language . 
  we are clearly in the west and it 's obvious we share western values with ya 'll . 
  why ca n't we join ? 
  i mean ... if not having a shared head-of-state is the answer ... than you got ta open the door to the entire commonwealth as well ... and why are they allowed in and not use when they lack on more of the above than us ? 
  than why not encourage a north american union ?
