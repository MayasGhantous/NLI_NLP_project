  you know when hitler began his visit to belgium & france ? 
  ** in the summer . 
  ** and that 's on top of him visiting beligum ** before ** he visits france . 
  i think not !, 
  like i said , the majority of wars have realpolitik reasons , even some of the ones you think were * `` just '' * . 
  i do n't know what you 're trying to tell me , i 've seen all of this shit before after doing research on my own . 
  lol although i did support afghanistan . 
  and did clinton invade ? 
   though like i said , most wars have realpolitik motivations behind them . 
  even some of the ones you yourself think were * `` just '' * . 
  you 're right . 
  why do we even have standing armies anyway if we have n't been invaded ? 
  we need to bring back that fuedal-type shit son . 
  and the point is ... the united states * was * involved in libya & mali , and the countries in question * did * ask for help . 
  and not just for * image * like iraq or afghanistan , but out of * necessity * . 
  notice the difference ? 
  [ nato commander : eu could not do libya without us ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/115650 )  nato major-general marcel druart , addressing the european parliament committee on security and defence on tuesday ( 20 march ) , said nato relied heavily on us military expertise on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) capabilities . 
  [ dempsey : france formally asks for u.s. aid in mali ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/ )  the french government has formally requested u.s. military assistance to combat al qaeda in the islamic maghreb in mali , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the american forces press service on thursday, 
  most wars have realpolitik motivations behind them . 
  you think france would 've got involved in mali if niger did n't provide 1/5th of their uranium ? 
  and i got the name wrong . 
  it was * `` curveball '' * . 
  he was a central figure in the * cassus belli * for the war , where i would 've just , like i said above , drawn from the long-list of saddam 's other crimes against his own people for justification . 
  but than again , i also opposed the war . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curveball_ ( informant ), 
  alright , that 's great , but it only goes to back up my point that it was for image , not out of necessity like with europe in libya & mali . 
   and maybe they lied , maybe they did n't , but if they did n't lie , puttin ' all that trust into a shaky informant named * '' ~ ~ screwball ~ ~ curveball '' * and launchin ' a war over it is stupid enough to be a fuckin ' crime , that 's for sure . 
  if it was me i would 've just went the whole * `` oppressed kurds '' * route and . . you know ... built up moral justification based on all the other horrible shit saddam did ... i mean ... it 's not exactly like he did n't have a 2-mile long laundry list of shit to draw from . 
  though i still opposed the war despite saddam being a brutal , human right violating , murdering scumbag . 
   i would give the arctic to russia if if would avoid a war between russia and canada . 
  most canadians i know , however , are counting on the usa to go to war for us , i know this . 
  alright , if that 's the case , we want british columbia & newfoundland or it 's war . 
   although , seriously , there 's nothing wrong with them relying on us . 
  us north american brothers need to stick together . 
    when you say the french were `` forced '' to rely on the usa for help , what do you mean ? 
  they could n't turn to their european allies outside of the united kingdom because their european allies were either unwilling to help or unable to help because of low military spending . 
   thank you for your reply , btw . 
  how do you not let europeans ' hatred of americans interfere with your politics ? 
  if i were american i know i would want to let europe go to russia , i 'm still sore about canada getting involved with afghanistan . 
  eh , i guess it 's a combination of still likin ' many europeans & wanting the united states to retain it 's precedence in the world . 
  the difference between iraq & afghanistan is this ; the united states assembled a international coalition * image * , europe asks the united states for help out of * necessity * . 
  for somebody like you , i would think that whole * `` bullshit image of international support '' * thing would be at the top of your radar . 
   and this is comin ' from a guy who opposed the iraq war . 
  countries in eastern europe ar n't so confident in that , and who can blame them given their history ? 
  also , even at the scale it is , it was n't able to handle libya . 
  france could 've handled mali alone , but probably after emergency measures such as diverting certain forces which were already tasked with something else . 
  to handle it in the fashion they did , they were forced to turn to the united states , even though they should 've been able to rely on germany at first . 
  though germany is finally startin ' to take it 's role in europe 's power projection seriously iirc with a recent deployment to mali , which is good , and they need to take it seriously if they want the european union to actually succeed and be a real influential force in the world . 
  they may wish that , but international inaction is what directly led to shit like srebrinca . 
  i 'm glad the united states put a fire under europe 's ass and really stepped up involvement , though we should 've done it a lot fuckin ' earlier in my opinion . 
  libya was called for & initiated by european countries . 
  the united states was reluctant to get involved , but it 's hand was forced given the deficiency of european militaries when it comes to power projection * ( logistics , intelligence gathering , first strike weapons like tomohawks and b2s to take out aa defenses so the rest of the bombers can come through ) * . 
  but we still helped . 
  and the french [ still ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/ ) needed [ help ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563710/ ) . 
  and we still helped , even though the french should 've been able to turn to germany , instead of forced to rely on the united states , for the minor support they did require . 
  as for your comments about the fulda gap ... well ... i know this might blow your fuckin ' mind ... but the cold war has been over for more than twenty years , the soviet union collapsed and east germany was absorbed by west germany . 
  * lulz * though you know what i think of canadians when they say such ? 
  two words : russia & the artic . 
  yeah , like mali & libya which you called for ... or the tensions in eastern europe which , at it 's root , are caused by european union expansionism and affordin ' countries in the middle a choice between the eu and russia 's eurasian union ... to the determinent & anger of russia ... 
  but yeah , sure dude , everything is our fault . 
  and when we 're helpin ' you , we 're not really * `` helpin ' '' * you , we 're just pushin ' our own interests . 
  even if that does n't make sense ... since gettin ' constantly involved in both north africa & eastern europe is fuckin ' with obama 's primary global strategy of focusin ' on asia through his * `` pivot to the pacific '' * . 
  but yeah , you 're totally right dude and that totally makes sense . 
  yeah , was going to edit it into my comment before you posted . 
  we 'll see exactly where they 're comin ' from dependin ' on how long they 're a factor . 
  if they stop being around after the initial stages , than we know they 're looted , if they remain a constant , than we know they 're being supplied . 
  deterrence and shit like mali or libya which europe itself called for & pursued vigorously , despite havin ' to rely on american support in many areas * ( mali much , much less although i believe france should 've been able to turn to germany instead of the united states for the support they did end up requiring in certain areas ) * . 
  i agree , the a400m was a great decision given the deficiency in european logistics when it comes to transport aircraft . 
  i also heard there was a airbus tanker * ( not sure which version it 's a configuration of ) * in development as well , or possibly already in the field , which is also a pretty good decision . 
  i feel like mali , libya , the balkans & the fulda gap . 
  * lulz * i think you got it wrong , if anythin ' , we 're the pusher & you 're the fiend ; and we 're going to cut-you off if you 're not careful * ( you do n't care , but many of your fellow countrymen probably do ) * . 
  we care for you europe , and we hate seein ' you do this to yourself ; you have a foreign dependence that just wo n't quit . 
  heh , that 's so cute . 
   [ u.s. proposes ` more positive ' vision of nato-eu partnership ; united states department of defense news article ] ( http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45528 )  * birmingham , england , oct. 10 , 2000 * -- the united states must develop a clearer , `` more positive '' vision of the nato - european union partnership , defense secretary william s. cohen said oct. 10 to nato defense ministers here . 
   * `` i am convinced that a close , coherent , cooperative and transparent relationship will prove to be in the best interest of allies and european union members , both current and future , and further our overarching vision for the entire euro-atlantic community in all its political , social and security dimensions , '' * he said . 
   ** the policy shift elevates the european union military capability to the same level as nato . 
  ** * `` it is clear that in the future nato will no longer be the only major multilateral structure with a role in responding to crises , including military crises , which could affect european stability and security , '' * cohen said . 
  [ will the u.s. ` rebalance ' its contribution to nato ? 
  ] ( http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2013/10/will-us-rebalance-its-contribution-nato/72281/ )  defense secretary chuck hagel is on his way to brussels to have a difficult conversation with his fellow defense ministers in nato . 
  the point of contention is the continued reduction of the military capabilities of our allies and their growing dependence on u.s. support . 
   hagel will repeat to european allies the stark message made by robert gates on his last trip to brussels as defense secretary . 
  gates made international headlines with his warning of * `` a dim , if not dismal future '' * for nato if it continues to be divided * `` between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments , and those who enjoy the benefits of nato membership ... but do n't want to share the risks and the costs . '' *  ---------------------------------------------------  hagel was even more explicit at the defense ministers meeting in june when he said * `` over-dependence on any one country for critical capabilities brings with it risks . '' * ** one of these risks is that the u.s. will soon tell its allies , if you do n't invest much in your defense , neither will we . 
  ** the u.s. will * `` rebalance * '' its own shrinking defense dollars to allies and partners that share the security burden more equitably . 
  too many european leaders refuse to realize that this long-festering problem is having a dangerously corrosive effect on the alliance . 
  [ u.s. military says it may have to cut europe budget by fifth ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/us-usa-defence-europe-idusbre9ak1fx20131121 )  * ( reuters ) * - the united states may be compelled to cut its military spending in europe next year by as much as a fifth in the latest round of reductions under `` sequestration '' , america 's top general in the region said on thursday . 
  and i 'm sure that everybody in ** western europe ** is very confident in their defense . 
  problem is ... the eu & nato is n't confined to * western * europe . 
  yes , and both situations are examples of europe trying to exercise power projection and either failing , or having to rely on the united states to make it easier . 
  in short , it shows that europe ca n't pursue it 's own interests when it wants to without the aid of the united states * ( although mali is a different situation , and france could 've did it if they took emergency measures and diverted forces from elsewhere , it should 've been able to turn to germany before the united states ) * . 
  it makes you dependent on us and increases our influence on the continent . 
  if you want that , fine , be my guest . 
  but in my opinion it 's become more of a liability to the united states than a benefit given our attempts to * `` pivot to the pacific '' * , so that 's why i oppose it . 
  yes . 
  but than again , i believe the united states should continue to uphold it 's international agreements and maintain/build upon it 's relationship with other countries ; especially with countries in europe given the rising star of the european union * ( if it does n't crash-and-burn , or bureaucratically render itself ineffective ) * , so it can continue to remain at the forefront of the world 's institutional framework . 
  in short , i believe this is beneficial to the american hegemony , so i support it . 
  some people call me a neo-imperialist , but i prefer to be called a hegemonist instead . 
  it might 've been actually , i would n't be surprised , i know there 's a couple pieces of american military equipment derived from european models , like the [ m-777 howitzer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m777_howitzer ) & the [ m252 mortar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m252_mortar ) from your own country . 
  iirc parts of the f-35 are also to be made in the united kingdom . 
  which i think even supports my argument more . 
  it 's not like we 're asking you to increase military spending to feed into * our * military-industrial complex , you have a thrivin ' local defense industry you can buy from yourselves .
