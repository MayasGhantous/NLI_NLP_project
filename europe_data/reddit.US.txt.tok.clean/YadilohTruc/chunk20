  yes , but the canadian * accent * is much closer to the united states than britain . 
  and i 'd even argue more culturally similar either , but i wo n't push that . 
  and if the head-of-state is your argument , than you have to open the door to the entire commonwealth as well . 
  plus it could be argued that the canadian goverment is closer to the united states * in spirit * because it 's a federal democracy , not a unitary democracy like with the united kingdom and it 's devolved powers . 
  also the united states has a healthcare system similar to that of switzerland . 
  would you deny switzerland the right to join the european union ? 
  america 's military actions are similar to that of france . 
  all i 'm saying is if you let canada in , you have to let us in . 
  yes , and the majority of those accents are much closer to the american one than the ~ ~ canadian ~ ~ british one . 
  yeah , i 'll be watching movies based in canada and not realize it 's * set in canada * until they take their money out . 
  why ca n't america join ? 
  are our values truly that different from eastern european countries * ( politically leaning ) * , france * ( militarily ) * and britain * ( culturally ... at least as much as canadians ) * ? 
  and our healthcare system is modeled on switzerland , so that should n't really preclude us either unless you 're precluding switzerland . 
  well that makes sense if you 're expanding into asia , but you 're not , you 're expanding across the ocean into north america . 
  eurasia and the americas are two whole different ballparks . 
  well america 's a culturally and politically anglo-american country as well ; it 's clearly in the west , probably the most prominent country in the west . 
  can we join too ? 
  along with australia and new zealand ? 
  who mainly could n't be trusted because of russia using gazprom as a political weapon against them ? 
  so ... the best solution is to just go straight to gazprom ? 
  * brilliant . 
  when did i ever said it 's actions were constitutive as supportive ? 
  does switzerland support north korea because it 's neutral ? 
  and it 's * really hard * to carry out successful negotiations when you handicap yourself by throwing away the stick and just try to shove a carrot down russia 's throat . 
  the jews did this . 
  we made him a astroturfer , not a male enhancement product . 
  i do n't think anybody is for a military solution , ** especially ** the united states . 
  but do n't a slight majority of germans also oppose economic sanctions against russia as well ? 
  i get more of a sense of isolationism and keeping the * status quo * from germany than i do about them looking for other solutions . 
  it 's actually surprising that merkel is taking such a firm stance on the issue against russia . 
  everybody is a us puppet . 
  your birth was actually a cia-initiated operation designed to increase the population of the united kingdom to over-burden it 's social welfare net . 
  do n't make sense ? 
  * open your eyes sheeple . 
   btw . 
  there were hardly any russian in the stasi or east german army ( nva ) after the 1950s . 
  this is actually exactly my point . 
  the east german military as well was the only one , in comparison to other soviet satellite states , which could be entrusted with operations independent of the soviet military . 
  i 'm not sure how much of that had to do with competence , but i 'd be damned surprised if loyalty in the officer and nco corps did n't play a large role . 
  the fact that the east german government , despite still being a satellite state , did n't need as much supervision as other satellite states * ( as you pointed out there were hardly any russians in the stasi after the 1950s ) * only goes to give credence to my theory . 
  plus ... you know ... there is the fact that putin himself spent the last part of his kgb career stationed in dresden , east germany ... assigned to [ directorate s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_putin#kgb_career ) , the illegal intelligence-gathering unit * ( the kgb 's classification for agents who used falsified identities ) * . 
  i mean ... * it does make you think * ... did any russian * ( as the successor state of the soviet union ) * intelligence assets survive the collapse of east germany and the re-unification ? 
  did any of them manage to embed themselves in the political and business circles of germany up until the present-day ? 
  it 's doubling-down on russian gas through gazprom instead of trying to diversify supply . 
  and germany wo n't cut off the gas because , like i said , it 's like refusing to drink water in a desert . 
  plus the united states does n't receive 36 % of it 's oil from venezuela . 
  but that 's not really keeping your options open , that 's doubling-down on your already existing option . 
  it 's the exact opposite of diversifying your energy supply and broadening your horizons . 
  plus why would germany cut off the gas itself ? 
  that 's like me being in the desert and refusing water . 
  and while i * definitely * do n't believe merkel is trying to align germany with russia , we have to keep in mind that schroeder * was * chancellor of germany at the time those shady deals were going down and at very center of it 's political nexus . 
  it raises questions about the size and influence of the russian lobby in germany . 
  we re-programmed him ; made him faster , stronger , smarter . 
  yeah , this is actually pretty ridiculous . 
  any russian sympathies i would attribute less to that and more to the half-century of being a soviet satellite state and the propaganda that comes with it . 
  the east german government * ( especially the stasi and military ) * was n't just immigrant/appointed russians . 
  but even if that 's true , does it really take away from the fact that he was moving germany closer in political alignment with russia during his chancellorship ? 
  even if it was only for a nice retirement check after he left office ? 
  now , given merkel 's stance even in the face of infirm public support , i do n't believe the present german government is interested in doing the same ... especially after crimea ... but the fact that schroeder even existed * does * give credence to the theory , it 's not completely out of left-field , especially in relation to any influence schroeder might still exercise over business/political circles . 
  i mean dude , i 'm from the united states , i know the taint which a former leader can leave ... but that 's just the thing ... i ca n't immediately dismiss every theory that pops up now about the united states because of bush it 's not that far-fetched ... just like this , because of schroeder , is n't that far-fetched anymore . 
  eh , fair enough . 
  but i had assumed that your comment was in agreement with neutralgreek and implied your own personal view , which i was giving a counter-argument to . 
  my apologies if i was rude or incorrect in my reasoning . 
  well , if we 're talking about the european union as a whole , the populace might not support your opinion . 
  and germany was bitching at the united states for putting it 's own national interests above it 's relationship with germany ? 
  what the fuck is this other than the grandest hypocrisy in relation to germany and the european union * ( eastern european member-states specifically ) * ? 
  ... what about the eastern european and other eu or nato member-states which opposes shit like nord stream ? 
  how can you lead the eu when you 're deliberately increasing it 's energy dependence on a foreign nations instead of diversifying it and are willing to economically isolate eastern european eu member-states * ( russia can now cut off natural gas to them without cutting it off to the rest of western europe ) * to push forward your own national interests ? 
  what about nordstream , which was signed in the closing days of chancellor schroeder 's administration * ( with the german government guaranteeing to cover 1 billion euros of the project cost ) * and the fact that gerhard schroeder now chairs the company building the pipeline ? 
  america does n't even want a intervention . 
  the only ones i really hear calling for it are eastern europeans ... and i kinda ca n't blame them given their history ... 
  it seems like every post you make is a quote from the russian textbook the [ `` foundations of geopolitics '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) . 
  like . . literally ... everything from the anti-atlanticism and wanting to drive a wedge between the european union & the united states , to wanting the united kingdom to be cut off from the european union and even your support of the annexation of crimea , which to quote the book :  ukraine should be annexed by russia because `` ukraine as an independent state with certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of eurasia and , without resolving the ukrainian problem , it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics '' . 
  ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent , unless it is cordon sanitaire , which would be inadmissible now i 'm going to stop talking to you so you do n't get another $ 3 . 
  but ugh ... do you still get paid or are your handlers still happy when everything your post actually goes to turn the tide of public opinion * against * russia ? 
  you 're pretty shitty at this man . 
  lol, 
  [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web_brigades#nashi_involvement )  in january 2012 a group that presented itself as the russian wing of the anonymous published a massive collection of what they claimed to be e-mails of former and present leaders of the pro-kremlin youth organization nashi ( including a number of government officials ) . 
  journalists who investigated the leaked information discovered numerous references to an army of paid commenters that reportedly operated in the fall of 2011 . 
  ** according to the e-mails , members of the `` brigades '' were paid 85 rubles ( about 3 us dollars ) or more per comment , depending on whether the comment received replies ; some were presented with ipads . 
  ** a number of high-profile bloggers were also mentioned as being paid for promoting nashi 's and government activities . 
  the federal youth agency whose head ( and the former leader of nashi ) vasily yakemenko was the highest-ranking individual targeted by the leaks refused to comment on authenticity of the e-mails .

   ** story highlights **  * the uss donald cook will be in the black sea by thursday  * russian troops are still massed on the ukraine border  * nato representatives will meet april 15 to discuss the situation ---------------------------------------------------------------  ** washington ( cnn ) ** -- the navy warship uss donald cook is scheduled to enter the black sea no later than thursday as part of the latest u.s. military effort to demonstrate support for eastern european allies concerned about russia 's troop buildup along its border with ukraine . 
   the movement of the guided missile destroyer was confirmed to cnn by two u.s. military officials who declined to be identified because a formal announcement has not been made . 
  the ship will conduct exercises and port visits while in the black sea . 
  the guided missile destroyer uss truxtun took part in scheduled exercises in the black sea last month and departed march 21 . 
   nato members bulgaria , romania and turkey have black sea coastlines , as do non-members ukraine , russia and georgia . 
  we 're trying to actively undermine germany 's sovereignty by recognizing the fact you 're a sovereign nation with differing national interests from our own ? 
  if that 's the definition we 're going off , than ** russia is definitely doing that to germany . 
  ** but i 'm sure nordstream and germany 's energy dependence on russia is also not threatening to german sovereignty * ( or the sovereignty of eastern european countries like poland ) * either in your mind . 
  i do n't really like the heritage foundation at all , but i 'll be damned if they were n't right on this . 
  yeah , that was my reaction too . 
  i mean ... racial hatred is horrible ... but how many black people do you guys even have ? 
  i would 've expected him to say some shit like they 're all muslims or gypsies or something like that . 
  seriously ; and nord stream is the one that actually poses a security threat to sweden and which can economically isolate eastern european nato/eu member-states * ( russia can now cut off gas to them without cutting off gas to the rest of western europe ) * . 
  though i guess it 's just easier to pressure bulgaria than germany . 
  agreed , and i could 've been a little more civil . 
  that said however , this is the thing . 
  ** the european union was n't a thing then .
