  ** europe was divided ; it 's military framework on the continent revolved around the united states and great britain * ( which not only had a special relationship with the united states , but was loosing it 's colonial empire to draw upon , thus making it that much more indebt to the united states if it wished to retain it 's prominence ) * . 
  france , as i mentioned above , had left nato during this time period . 
  half of germany was in soviet hands , as was all of poland * ( two very important states , both militarily and economically , when talking about the european union ) * . 
  there was no schengen area , there was no euro or common defense policy or maastricht treaty . 
  sweden was still neutral , austria was/is neutral , finland was/is weary as fuck and switzerland still had every international bridge/tunnel crossing rigged to blow , with fallout shelters required in every home . 
  fuck , soviet invasion plans from the 80s actually revolved around rushing the low countries first and completely ignoring france to try and keep them out the war , while cutting off the americans , west germans and british soldiers in germany from their supply ports there * ( your country really does get fucked by the same general plan in every world war , huh ? ) * . 
  so , before the 2000s , the economic and political might of a unified europe was all but non-existent . 
  the soft power of europe was all but non-existent and the effect of american influence over the continent can not be under-stated during this period . 
  and even now , chronic under-spending on your militaries has resulted in shit like libya , which required extensive american logistics , intelligence , and first strike aircraft * ( b2s & tomahawks to hit sam sites before the other bombers come in ) * . 
  i mean , one european military was reduced to dropping cement training bombs on libyan targets because of inadequate national supply-lines . 
  now , you 'll be fine in a total war scenario , you 're one of the wealthiest and technologically advanced regions on the planet . 
  but here 's the thing , we live in a * nuclear age * . 
  total war might not happen , the next war might be short , decisive and limited ... decided in the first couple days , not the first couple months/years . 
  if you want to defend france or germany from a modern-day russian attack where you have a rather manageable timetable ? 
  by all means you 're capable of doing it independently . 
  want to defend estonia where power projection is key * ( hence dependent on logistics , intelligence and first-strike aircraft ) * and will require a rapid response ? 
  you wo n't be able to do it without the united states . 
  this affords us more influence through hard power . 
  so to this day american soft & hard power is still significant on the continent , but not hegemonic . 
  but before the eu formed , germany united and france re-joined nato ? 
  our influence was god damn supreme . 
  you were n't puppet governments , i never said or implied you were , but down-playing american influence , especially after all of the above and suez canal ... is just foolish ... 
  ** note : i agree with your points on rwanada and admit many of my assertions were incorrect , although some i believe still stand . 
  but that said , your understanding of european-american cold war relations or the extent of american influence on the continent is just as pathetic as my understanding of the intricacies of the rwanda situation - **  is that what they teach in american schools nowadays , that european powers decolonized because the americans told them to ? 
  no , but it was a very , very motivating factor . 
  or are you just going to ignore the influence of a world superpower over a devastated and torn europe ? 
   that 's like saying the us ended slavery because the european powers told them to ... sure , there was pressure ; but the economical , political and moral motivators were a lot more important than outside pressure . 
  no , it 's like if europe helped defeat the north , rebuild a war devastated south and garrisoned soldiers along the border to protect from canadian communists from half-a-century . 
  then used all that leverage to help push for and motivate de-colonization . 
  oh , and they also have a economy and industrial base that absolutely dwarfs america . 
  so yeah , i think european influence on the matter would be * a little pronounced * if that was the case . 
   so , who the hell calls the suez crisis `` the death nail of colonialism '' ? 
   de-colonization had been going on for years by then , with every single african and asian country ( except portuguese colonies and some french overseas departments ) either independent or on a definitive roadmap to independence . 
   there 's apparently some major historical revisionism going on in the usa , when it comes to their influence in european politics . 
  not surprising , really , as according to the us version of history practically everything we did and do in europe is ` because the us told us so ' . 
  oh fuck off with that * `` there must be some serious revisionism in u.s. schools '' * alright , it 's such a cunty , cunty thing to say especially since you do n't know where the fuck i learned it from . 
  i 'm not here implying you 're stupid or that flanders has a shitty fucking school system or that belgium indoctrinates it 's population . 
  for fuck 's sake , ** can you be anymore smug ? 
  ** lulz and you 're right , american influence on europe was nill . 
  the marshall plan did n't really do much , nato was a non-factor and there was no reason to garrison troops at the fulda gap for half-a-century . 
  and even if we did do all that shit , i 'm sure our influence would 've been completely insignificant like you say . 
  ** my apologies . 
  ** and really , thank god the suez canal crisis was n't a watershed moment in european colonialism and the cold war in general . 
  it totally did n't have a effect on future colonial endeavors when the united states , after the threat of the soviets going nuclear , stepped in prevented the french , british and israelis from going any deeper into egypt , thus also establishing america has the * de facto * hegemon of the western world ... which for some reason ... you think did n't have a significant effect on europe or a sign of heavy american influence ? 
   yeah , we 're all paws on a chessboard , are n't we ? 
   you 're seriously overestimating the usa 's influence and power in european affairs , and vastly underestimating european agency . 
  yes , we are , and no , i 'm not . 
  what european agency are you talking about by the way ? 
  the european coal & steel community ? 
  the european atomic energy commission ? 
  what pan-european sentiment existed then ? 
  europe was divided and still recovering . 
  it could n't even stop france from leaving in the 1960s ; which , mind you , only led to increased american influence on the continent ... which i guess ... * did n't happen * ? 
  who was belgium going to rely on first if soviet tanks came rolling down the street ; you would 've been one of the first targets , west germany is basically fucked as is and france is no longer in nato ; yet , you do n't think that , combined with nato , the marshall plan and our general participation in wwii did n't give us some pretty heavy fucking leverage ? 
  especially when we 're by far the largest member economically , military and in population ? 
   to be fair , tribalism and ethnic conflicts was n't ` introduced ' by the european colonial powers . 
  they probably decreased any such violence during their reign ... 
  i never said it was introduced , but i did say it was maintained and manipulated to their favor . 
  and of course there was decreased violence . 
  you pit a bunch of people who hate each other and want to kill each other , than keep the peace . 
  they ca n't rise up to fight you because they hate each other . 
  dude ... this shit is like divide and conquer 101 ... or did you think a bunch of small european countries no bigger than some u.s. states were able to conquer most the world by sheer military might and numbers ? 
  oh , and what happens when you suddenly leave and those two groups who hated each other no longer have a strong-man keeping them from each other ? 
  well , they usually slaughter each other and a strong man gains power . 
   please do n't say shit like that , it makes you seem very arrogant . 
   the europeans decolonialized because their mentality and economic means had changed . 
  american ` insistence ' had very little to do with it . 
  actually , it 's not arrogant . 
  it 's completly accurate . 
  are you forgetting about the [ suez canal crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis ) ? 
  the so-called * `` death nail '' * of colonialism ? 
  or the moves franklin roosevelt made to get winston churchill , the imperialist himself , to acknowledge [ the principles of de-colonization ] ( http://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/atlantic-conf ) in exchange for american aid and support during wwii ? 
  i mean , it 's a rather well-accepted notion just how hard it [ pushed it 's western allies to dismantle their colonial empires ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decolonization#united_states ) ? 
  we did this not only because it was in our national interests economically and militarily , but also because we were in a fierce competition with the soviet union to win over the newly-independent regions . 
   i doubt there were any frenchmen and/or belgians encouraging genocide in any way . 
   you know , what makes people over here so mad is the fact that kagame is most likely the one that instigated everything , as he is almost certainly the one that organized the murder of the sitting president . 
  the fact that it 's him blaming ` us ' for his genocide is what 's so infuriatingly hypocritical . 
  well it depends , many here supported the irish uprising for independence , the recent ukrainian uprising and a number of other revolts , but when talking about a african rebel group which had not only just shaken off colonial oppressors , but now had ethnic oppressors , they 're in the wrong ? 
  the death of the president might 've been the spark , but you do n't pick up your machete and murder your neighbor without a * little * tension going on before that . 
  i mean ... would you say a jew caused the holocaust if he killed hitler in the 1930s , but it still happened anyway ? 
  personally , compared to the other african leaders , he seems to be pretty god damn competent and able , and to top it off , well-liked by both ethnic groups in a country only twenty-years fresh from a massive genocide . 
  well ... it kinda was this time ... given the fact that the tutsi and hutu were specifically pitted against each other by the germans * ( and later the belgians ) * so the colony would be cheaper to administrate thanks to lower troop requirements * ( divide & conquer ) * . 
  and then the destabilization that occurred afterwards could be directly attributed to us since europe * ( at the united states ' insistence ) * began a massive decolonization effort ... thus leaving a power vacuum for strong men to gain power . 
  and france specifically was one of the ones who provided extensive help to the rwandan government , with most of rwanda 's arms deals being negotiated through the rwandan embassy in paris and the french provisioning military advisers and technical assistants for the country 's ruling government . 
  so . . this time ... it is whitey 's fault ... or at least mostly europe and a little bit america 's fault * ( first for rushing decolonization , second for not intervening when it needed to ) * ... 
  i could use all of those , but i believe this is the most relatable and prominent historically , hence why i think it 's also the most defining . 
  i never said it was the reason for it , i simply said it 's the most defining factor . 
  an with northern europe being majority protestant , and southern europe being majority catholic , i think it 's a fair factor to help distinguish the two . 
  so ireland 's excluded too then ? 
  ** fuck off with that bullshit dude ** [ obama administration reiterates belief uk is stronger within eu ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/23/obama-administration-uk-eu ) [ eu exist would put us trade deal at risk , britain warned ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/27/eu-exit-risks-us-trade-deal ) [ barack obama : britain should stay in the eu ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9810334/barack-obama-britain-should-stay-in-the-eu.html ) [ obama administration warns u.k. of economic loss if it exits eu ] ( http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/foreign-policy/item/15551-obama-administration-warns-uk-of-economic-loss-if-it-exits-eu ), 
  he 's got a point . 
  even if europe is n't as religious as it used to be , there 's still a pretty clear divide between the protestant north and catholic south . 
  so while religion might not * motivate * or * guide * anymore , it does still * define * . 
  a smaller example can be seen with north ireland & ireland . 
  i mean , would you call the irish troubles a religious conflict ? 
  i would n't ; because i do n't personally believe religion in itself was the primary * motivating * factory for the troubles , but i do believe it is a * defining * factor . 
   ** more u.s. aircraft have deployed to poland amid growing concern for russian presence in central-eastern europe . 
  **  last week , three c-130j super hercules aircraft deployed to 33rd air transport base in powidz , poland . 
   the transport planes will take part in an exercise featuring also paratrooper drops over the drawsko and b\u0142\u0119dowska desert ranges as well as launches over the powidz base itself . 
   the joint drills are expected to include comao ( composite air operations ) witn polish f-16s and mig-29s , as well as c-130js , including grass runway training for the transport aircraft .
