   ** the russian energy company , gazprom has raised the price it charges ukraine for gas by more than a third . 
  **  the company 's chief executive alexei miller says the change was because kiev has failed to pay its bills . 
   he said its current debt to russia stood at just over $ 1.7 bn ( # 1.02 bn ) . 
   russia had previously offered kiev a subsidy , but the recent political crisis in ukraine has led to a deterioration in relations . 
   mr miller says the price of russian gas for ukraine has gone up to $ 385.50 per 1,000 cubic metres in the second quarter of 2014 from the previous rate of $ 268.50 . 
  why ca n't ya 'll just shoot each other to death over crack cocaine like normal people in america instead of beating each other to death over soccer teams ? 
  says the guy who thinks collateral damage can be completely avoided and civilians can live happily and contently in the middle of a warzone . 
  yeah , which is why he knows i 'm right . 
  please , have you invented a new way of warfare that 's free of collateral damage and civilian suffering ? 
  the whole fucking world would love to know . 
  it 's always a game of chicken , and we have to be just as willing to go nuclear over the baltic states . 
  so is surrendering the continent , does n't mean we should do it . 
  and if russia wants to commit suicide over the baltic , that 's their choice , not ours . 
  i do n't give a fuck what the * `` un-word of 1999 '' * was , but it 's not a trivializing euphemism , it 's disgusting , but it 's not trivializing . 
  you got a education , so do n't act stupid . 
  the fog-of-war happens , insurgents and others specifically hide in civilian populations and buildings to disguise their movements and use the innocent civilians as human shields for a cheap pr victory . 
  the military-industrial complex will always be entwined within the civilian industry and infrastructure . 
  logistical networks , bridges , roadways , railroads , will always be entwined with civilians infrastructure . 
  do n't act stupid or like some douchey self-enlightened ass-hat . 
  go ask the german government or military and they 'll tell you the same god damn thing . 
  you might think his comments are meaningless , but the history it reflects definitely is not . 
  the cold war was kept cold based on these principles . 
  and if russia is willing to go nuclear over a bunch of small baltic states why the fuck should n't we ? 
  that ai n't russia proper , just like it ai n't america proper . 
  mad is a game of chicken , and you want to flinch before it 's your time to flinch . 
  and the best way to win a game of chicken , is to not play chicken and just go full-speed into the motha fucker . 
  do n't turn son . 
  we have a mutual defense pact with these countries , russia does n't . 
  russia would go nuclear if we attacked kazakhstan or ukraine , we should go nuclear over these countries . 
  i could understand if it was over a country that was n't nato , ** but these are nato . 
  ** we just ca n't turn . 
  call it foolish if you will , but this is what nuclear weapons entail . 
  you either play for keeps or you do n't play at all . 
  i hate to keep repeating that word , but it 's what mad 's very principles are based on . 
  if russia 's willing to do it , than we sure as fuck better be willing to do it . 
  same strategy which kept the cold war cold . 
  same strategy we had at the fulda gap . 
  same strategy we had over cuba and turkey . 
  it 's what keeps mad actually mad . 
  without it , we ai n't shit , the world ai n't shit , and fuck retreating back to the continent with our tails between the legs . 
  yes , and the world will probably end like that in such a scenario , but if russia goes tactical after a conventional fight , well fuck them , we better go strategic and chance that .1 % before they go strategic and our shitty pathetic chances go down to .000001 % . 
  you fuck up the paradigm . 
  you 're fucking up what works . 
  it worked during the cold war , it worked for the fulda gap , and it 'll work now . 
  if not , well than fuck , that our fault as a collective human race . 
  and submission is better than a radioactive ash pile to , but i do n't see opposing the deaths of 6 billion people over 300 million americans . 
  why is that ? 
  like i said , it 'll start out as conventional . 
  if russia wants to end the world , russia is a asshole , but that 's it . 
  russia wanted to push us , russia wanted to start a war we both know would go nuclear , so fuck russia in this scenario . 
  they fucked up the rules , they fucked up the game , and now we 're all paying the consequences . 
  but like i said , i will more than happily piss blood and lose my hair over something like this , even if you wo n't . 
  and history , as well as president obama 's comments , speak to the same . 
  nukes * do n't work * if you ar n't ready to use them , if you ar n't committed to using them . 
  mutually assured destruction is only guaranteed by it being ** mutually assured ** . 
  and you keep acting like it 'd be instant escalation . 
  as i said , it 'd start out as a conventional war , where it could be confined to being short , limited and decisive . 
  it does n't have to go nuclear unless russia makes it nuclear , and if russia makes it nuclear well then fuck russia we should first-strike and hope for the best because i 'm not going to be putin 's little scared bitch across the pond while he amasses a european empire at the expense of our interests . 
  well , that and if russia goes tactical we * better * go strategic first because at least then we have a .1 % chance of surviving if they deadhand is only a rumor and we actually decapitate them before they launch . 
  ** they have n't violated the treaty . 
  ** actually read the treaty . 
  it 's an * agreement * made in 2006 , not a * binding clause * listed in the treaty . 
  and what does america loose ? 
  well russia 's dick just got five-times bigger and our military alliances in the pacific completely fall apart giving china a irreversible advantage , so it 's pretty fucking shitty for our interests . 
  but do n't say * `` well it 's better than radioactive ash '' * was so it surrendering if russia invades north america . 
  we must stand our ground . 
  we must honor our treaties and maintain our pre-eminent position in the world if want to actually have some-kind of influence and say in how the world begins to look for the next couple hundred years . 
  this is perfect . 
  lol, 
  they 're not glorifying them , they 're just ignoring them and calling ameri ** kkk ** a the real war criminal * in yugoslavia * . 
  which is hilarious . 
  wwi was n't worth it from that perspective , but we were there . 
  wwii was n't worth it from that perspective , but we were there . 
  western europe was n't worth it from that perspective , but we still garrisoned the fulda gap for damn near half-a-century . 
  cuba & turkey were n't worth it from that perspective , but we damn near started a nuclear war over them . 
  the suez canal too . 
  history proves you wrong ; the very basics of what make m.a.d. 
  a viable deterrant prove you wrong . 
  you ca n't deter nuclear war if you 're not willing to fight a nuclear war . 
  it sounds counter-intuitive , it does , but it 's what stopped the cold war from becoming hot . 
  you 're talking about ** his ** country for fucks sake man . 
  and no shit it 's a dangerous thing to provoke , but if you ai n't gon na do shit when you provoked than fuck it . 
  what 's the point ? 
  why not just hand russia every country in europe and the middle east besides france , the united kingdom and israel ? 
  if we do n't move conventionally against russia it 'd be such a stupid fucking mistake , the biggest since wwii appeasement . 
  and notice how i say conventionally ? 
  the only one who 'll escalate is russia and that 's russia 's god damn fault . 
  i 'm not going to blame myself when i 'm loosing hair and pissing blood , * i 'm going to blame russia * . 
  because they invaded a nato country . 
  ** we must not abandon our allies because we 're pussies . 
  ** ** we must not abandoned eastern europe to russia for a second time ** . 
  and i 'll do everything i can in my minuscule power to make my voice heard and ensure that does n't happen . 
  yes , it was planned on false grounds , srebrinca . 
  that never happened nor was it the primary motivation for the bombing campaign . 
   and i do n't quite know if you understand this , but even with smart bombs , ** you 're going to have collateral damage ** . 
  i do n't care who you are , if you have the most * basic * understanding of military tactics . 
  civilian infrastructure , bridges , railroads , fucking government buildings in the middle of downtown , * they 're all legitimate targets . 
  * do you think armies just like ... fucking pop out of thin air and do n't have a extensive military-industrial complex backing them up ? 
  are you foolish to think that military-industrial complex is n't irreversibly entwined with the civilian infrastructure ? 
  especially the serbian military ?
