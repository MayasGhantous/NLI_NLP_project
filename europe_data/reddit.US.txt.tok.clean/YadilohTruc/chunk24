  but how can you bitch about people not agreeing with you because you 're serbian and your country has made past mistakes , but at the same time , lambasting the united states because they 're the united states and have made past mistakes ? 
  should n't you support the notion being made if you agree with it based on principle alone ? 
  yeah dude i definitely understand the situation , was just poking fun at it ; sorry if i came off like a dick though . 
  to say one thing and do the other ? 
  i 'd argue you can , * and did * , overturn two hundred years of policy . 
  you just have n't overturned two hundred years of sentiment yet . 
  i disagree , i very much believe they would be . 
  west germany , turkey and cuba have all been worth nuclear war in the past . 
  egypt too with the suez canal crisis . 
  only works if you 're actually willing to use nuclear weapons , or at least look like you are ; if you ar n't ... well you might as well not have nuclear weapons in the first place ... plus you 're forgetting about the american soldiers stationed in those countries , helping patrol baltic airspace or set up a anti-missile shield in poland . 
  any attack on either would not only result in article v being invoked , but dead americans as well , only adding fuel to the fire . 
  the deep south has always been admired for it 's exquisite education system . 
  but , that 's the problem , there 's a good chance there 's going to be a pretty big gap between the collapse of spain & the united kingdom * ( if it does happen ) * and a federal europe * ( if that ever happens ) * . 
  what do you do in the interim ? 
  the people who are going to be surprised by this have never heard of the iran-contra affair . 
  the middle east is fucking weird dude . 
  you ca n't call yourself non-aligned and neutral when you 've garrisoned soldiers in the balkans , joined a eu battlegroup , occupied afghanistan , sent planes to libya and are preparing to send soldiers to both mali & the central african republic . 
  well ... * you could * ... but you 'd just be lying . 
   then after that the us could try to include the seato ( basically the pacific nato ) meaning that australia , new zealand , thailand etc. 
  would join as well . 
  seato does n't exist anymore . 
  it was dissolved in 1977 . 
  the closest thing to a nato-type organization we have in the pacific is anzus , which is just america with australia and new zealand . 
  our other mutual defense pacts * ( the philippines , thailand , singapore , south korea , japan ) * are strictly bi-lateral . 
  it 's hard getting a bunch of different people who hate each other to sign the same piece of paper , let alone fight for each other . 
  yeah , i understand , and i know it 's all a pipe dream for the time being , but it 's still fun to think about while you 're playing armchair general in your head . 
  that said , it would be reassuring to at least see a little more effort for the eu battlegroups , instead of countries going around them and signing bilateral agreements . 
  but as you said , it 's all politics and for the moment there 's too much politics . 
  not only sovereignty-related , but also because of things like german reluctance to get involved in foreign military entanglements such as mali or libya . 
  though it looks like that issue might be changing , as germany finally acceded to sending some troops to mali last month and it 's president has called for a more active foreign policy . 
  also signals a revival of the franco-german brigade after i thought it died with france moving to sign bilateral military agreements with the united kingdom a couple years ago because , in my opinion , german isolationism . 
  true . 
  yes , but as i said , it 'd be drawing from ** 500 million ** people . 
  i 'm sure you can field 5-20 ,000 soldiers out of that who are proficient in a single language and whom identify as * `` european '' * . 
  i 'm only a armchair general , but it seems a lot easier to start with something like that than trying to convince soldiers of national armies to learn a new language and fight for a new country * ( which , if you guys get to the point of a independent military and coherent foreign policy , it would be for all intents and purposes ) * . 
  of course , this would n't work for large-scale offenses or wars or anything like that , because the recruiting would be so particular , but i believe it would be sufficient for operations like libya or mali . 
  or as a fast-reaction force if , for say , estonia is ever attacked so it can help hold-out until reinforcements from the national armies arrive . 
  but than again , i highly doubt the member-states will go for any of this in the foreseeable future ; it 's giving the european union way too much power with a independent military and chipping away too much national sovereignty with a unified foreign policy . 
  it 's all a pipe dream for the time being . 
  ** yes . 
  ** we 'd not only be morally and legally obligated because they 're in the west and nato , but also motivated to do something because of our realpolitik interests . 
  to understand this you have to remember we do n't consider russia as our main competitor and future rival . 
  china has that honor . 
  if we let nato fall , if we do n't protect our allies , what kind of message does that send to japan ? 
  to the philippines & south korea ? 
  to australia and new zealand ? 
  much of our influence , whether in europe or in asia , is derived from our hard power and willingness to use it to protect our allies . 
  but if we do n't do it for eastern europe ... why would asia/oceania think we 'd do it for them ? 
  we loose the biggest bargaining chip we have . 
  our * `` pivot to the pacific '' * is crippled militarily , economically we 're still superior to china , but for how long without the ability to slow them down through containment * ( whoms foundations are heavily constituted by military alliances ) * ? 
  we 'd be god damn fools to not defend eastern europe and might as well go switzerland and fuck off with some isolationism and neutrality , because our international position and influence would be irreversibly fucked . 
  i agree completely , but even in a european federation you 'll need large states to counter the other large states ; to balance them out . 
   both sweden and finland use standard nato equipment . 
  sweden even supplies several nato countries with arms exports . 
  ( i do n't know about finland exports though ) they also take part in some of the nato exercises and , what might surprise you , they even host some . 
  you know , this was my first assumption , and i was 90 % sure it was like this , but i kept telling myself it could n't be like that , because if they integrate , standardize and train with us , why in the hell are they not officially allied with us ? 
  i get finland , russia and the soviet union and shit , but what in the hell is sweden 's excuse ? 
   it 's like saying that nato is making two steps back for every step forward because some countries prefer stronger local alliances than these offered by nato itself . 
  i do n't mind local alliances at all . 
  i would n't mind seeing a scandinavian military alliance to go with the visegard group , franco-german brigade and lancaster treaties . 
  i believe that by allowing the european union to integrate further militarily and take another step towards an actual european military , it helps take the pressure off my own country so we can focus on the pacific & asia , instead of having to carry the weight of europe with the united kingdom and france while everybody else twiddles their thumbs * ( your country , estonia and greece being the few exceptions to that ) * . 
  yes , but ca n't much of that be solved through the european union recruiting * directly * from the population ? 
  with a population of around 500 million , you should n't have a problem raising a division , let alone a brigade , of willing individuals committed to a * european * cause , and the pool should be large enough that you can weed down recruits to those proficient in any language you prefer * ( french , english , german , etc. 
  ) * while keeping it balanced . 
  of course , it 'd be hard to replace large losses , but not if you only tailor the unit as a fast-reaction force , suitable for missions like libya , mali or the balkans . 
  an if you convince national governments to do * all this shit * , you should n't have a problem convincing them to lease some land for bases & training . 
  yes , but it does n't help that france has abandoned the franco-german brigade in all but name to strengthen military ties with the [ united kingdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lancaster_house_treaties ) outside of the european union 's framework * ( iirc even with a fast-reaction franco-british brigade under the guise of a ` combined joint expeditionary force ' ) * . 
  the next best thing is your own country 's [ visegrad group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group ) , but even that 's outside the framework of the european union . 
  now throw in sweden and finland not being in nato at all * ( so they lacksall the extra cross-training , integration and standardization that other eu states have with each other through it ) * ... and well shit ... it 's like one step forward and two steps back . 
  ** edit : it looks like i was wrong . 
  the franco-german brigade has been revived , with german soldiers being deployed with the french last month in mali . 
  get your national government to directly , or the european parliament * ( through your national meps ) * to indirectly , petition the eu commission to put the bill to a vote . 
  hope the eu commission drafts it and puts it to a vote . 
  then ensure it passes the european parliament . 
  then ensure every single member-state on the council of the european union does n't veto it . 
  eh , in my opinion , the shattering of spain is just as good of an idea as the shattering of the united kingdom . 
  if both go through , not only will europe be completely fucked when it comes to power projection * ( libya , mali , the balkans , etc. 
  ) * , but now germany , italy and france will completely dominate the european union * ( while probably shouldering all military commitments onto the back of france until they collapse from exhaustion , as mali and car already go to show ) * . 
  people complain about excessive german influence in the european union now , but ha , let 's see their reaction when two of big 5 disappear from existence . 
  also sucks dick for my own country 's interest ; our closest ally in europe and the european union will become a shell of it 's former self and we have to subsidize more of europe 's military defense and power projection to compensate . 
  singapore was kicked out of malaysia , it did n't secede . 
  and the fact it 's survived this long , and prospered , is considered a extraordinary feat , not a usual one . 
  and no , i do not think new york would be fine if it seceded , because i do n't think the united states would let them secede . 
  anybody can secede and survive if nobody opposes them , hell a rural village could do it , but the world is n't filled with nations that are all like * `` oh , yeah , cool just take all those people , their money and that strategic geography with you , that 's cool , we wo n't bother . 
  '' * well ... with the exception of malaysia ... . but they 're just the exception that proves the rule . 
  yeah , absolutely . 
  i was n't really comparing the confederacy to venice , just to secession movements in general . 
  venice 's chances are abysmal given it would have the population and resources of a city-state . 
  the days of byzantines , holy roman emperors and papal states is over . 
  much harder to do shit like that now . 
  well , yeah , but look at the american civil war . 
  there was no clause to leave the union , but they left anyway because * they could * , and the union fought a bloody four-year war because * they really could n't * . 
  if those regions want to secede illegally and illegitimately , ** they could ** . 
  they just have to deal with the consequences of it afterwards . 
  you can say all you want , but if you ca n't hold what you 've got , it ai n't worth shit . 
  really the country which is handling this best is the united kingdom , but as a american citizen , i do n't want to see our closest ally in europe and one of the largest member-states in the european union to be shattered , as it would be determinable to our own interests , but i do understand and respect the way they 're going about it . 
   ** the hague , netherlands ** - with moscow showing no signs of backing down from the standoff over ukraine , president obama today took a swing at russian president putin 's status on the global stage - describing russia as simply a * `` regional power '' * .

  russia is a regional power that is threatening some of its immediate neighbors - not out of strength , but out of weakness , '' * obama said at a joint press conference with dutch prime minister mark rutte .
