  ** edit : and i 'm not referencing the united kingdom by * `` you '' * , cause , in my opinion , france & the united kingdom are some of the very few countries which pull their own weight in nato & europe * ( and when france does need a little help in things like mali , it should be able to count on other eu member-states like germany , instead of forced to rely on the united states & the united kingdom alone , though iirc germany finally changed it 's tune on the matter which is great ) * . 
  we 're not asking for money , we 're askin ' you * ( nato member-states ) * to spend your own money , even if it 's on your own shit that is n't connected to the american military-industrial complex . 
  or do you think europe does n't have a internationally & domestically thriving arms industry ? 
  * lulz * and here 's the thing , ** nato countries agreed to do it . 
  ** nato is not a american , british & french subsidization program for your military , the other members should stop treatin ' it as such . 
  like i said [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24ija7/why_europe_looks_weak_to_putin/ch7mpnr ) , you could have the biggest cock in the world , but it 's nothin ' to brag about if you do n't know how to use it or ever even take it out your pants . 
  you can be the largest condom distributor in the world , but it 's nothin ' to be proud about if you do n't know how to use a condom . 
  it 's within the european union 's territory , but it 's not within ' , or under the direction of , it 's institution . 
  it could be moved to norway and still remain in europe , but outside the european union . 
  until you say america . 
  lol, 
  turkey & greece ? 
  yeah , except [ all nato member-states agreed to spend 2 % of their gdp on defense in 2006 ] ( http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2013/10/will-us-rebalance-its-contribution-nato/72281/ ) . 
  to bitch about shit your own country agreed to do , then failed to do . 
  that 's great , does n't mean they use them right or make enough of them . 
  [ libya , europe and the future of nato : always waiting for the u.s. cavalry ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato )  america was visibly reluctant to get involved , let alone lead the action . 
  and , having helped to knock out libya 's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes , it pulled back from the front-line operations . 
  but america 's role remains essential , not least in providing air-to-air refuelling , as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the european allies . 
  [ nato commander : eu could not do libya without us ] ( http://euobserver.com/defence/115650 )  nato major-general marcel druart , addressing the european parliament committee on security and defence on tuesday ( 20 march ) , said nato relied heavily on us military expertise on intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( isr ) capabilities . 
  [ dempsey : france formally asks for u.s. aid in mali ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/17/dempsey-france-formally-asks-for-us-aid-in-mali/ )  the french government has formally requested u.s. military assistance to combat al qaeda in the islamic maghreb in mali , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the american forces press service on thursday [ u.s. aiding france 's military operation in mali ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563710/ )  * bamako , mali * - france 's foreign minister said sunday that the united states is providing communications and transport help for an international military intervention aimed at wresting mali 's north out of the hands of islamist extremists . 
  you can have the biggest cock in the world , but if you do n't know how to use it , or ever take it out your pants , there 's no point in braggin ' about it . 
   not to point fingers at anyone , but someone carried out 20-something coups d'etat over alliances , many of them in europe . 
  the soviet union ? 
  yes you do , canada is a representative democracy ; just because the majority chose a different direction does n't mean you do n't have a voice , it just means you did n't have enough voices backing yours up . 
  i think he 's referencing poland & eastern europe , where canadian & american forces have been sent to bolster the local militaries * ala * nato iirc . 
  ... you do realize that wwi battles consisted of rolling artillery barrages with * thousands of guns * firing * hundreds of thousands of shells * with some guns capable of * 20 -- 30 shells a minute * . 
  in the battle of somme alone 1,738,000 shells were fired at the germans . 
  you do n't need to be * that accurate * when you just shell * everything * . 
  if anything , this is why modern armies have * less artillery * compared to the past , since they do n't need massed fire for the same effect . 
  yeah , unless it 's stalingrad , or somme , or sarajevo , or leningrad , or ypres , or any number of failed sieges or examples of trench warfare in history . 
  but i do get your point ; it works most the time , but it 's not always * `` perfectly '' * effective . 
  it actually amazes me that more american helicopters were n't shot down in afghanistan & iraq . 
  not to say many were n't shot down , but i mean , it was nothin ' like the soviets in afghanistan which always surprised me . 
  do n't worry , you can buy those at * any * military surplus store . 
  i have one right now , just sitting around . 
  you never know when you might need to use it . 
  not exactly sure , i 'm from a different state . 
  alright , lol , would 've been one of the few * `` cultural '' * rastafarians i 've heard of anyway ; i had assumed he was n't religious in the first place cuz cuttin ' your dreads off for them is like a sikh cutting his hair off . 
  well , considering it was posted to sas , you commented and i was brigaded , i would think that * somebody cares * . 
  but do you want to raise any specific points you find fault with ? 
  perhaps have a educated , balanced debate without one-line insults & jokes ? 
  i mean , i do n't really care what you call me or joke about , but i at least hope you would include * what you disagree with * and * what your own personal view on the situation is * while you 're at it . 
   and you would n't happen to be a [ subscriber ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/237ag3/more_flag_fury/cgukr56?context=3 ) & [ contributor ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/237ag3/more_flag_fury/ ) to sas would you / u/let _ the_monkey_go ? 
  perhaps you did n't find this through sas , i 'll give you the benefit of the doubt , but the timing was convenient to say the least . 
   if you did , i would hope you had read and understood the rules of sas to know why this is n't a allowed or encouraged thing there . 
  anyway , if you actually have something to say and a argument to give other than a one liner , i 'm waiting . 
  that 's very true . 
   but the police should think very carefully about the effect stop and search has on young black people in the capital . 
  yes , they very well should . 
  but shit , to be real , i 'm against stop & search in general . 
  but i 'm also against the war in drugs in general , so meh . 
  though let me give you an example of where i 'm coming from , though it 's based on america 's legal system so it 's different , but i think my point stands : * if i have a kilo of coke in the trunk , and i 'm driving down the road , and a cop pulls me over , comes to the door , and tells me he smells weed , and because of that he 's going to search my car , even though i do n't have any weed nor smoked any ... then they arrest me for having a brick of coke ... . fuck them , they 're in the wrong , because they searched me under false pretenses and violated my rights as a individual . 
  and i do n't give a damn about the way i dress and my gucci mane cd , fuck ya 'll , ya 'll in the wrong , freedom of expression is a valued ideal in the western world for a god damn reason . 
  * and that 's what i see all these search-and-frisk laws being at their very essence ; a violation of your privacy as a citizen . 
  i can fuck with the social contract , but you added this clause after i had already signed . 
  man , black people are only 3.3 % of the united kingdom 's population , but you do n't know a single white person who 's been stopped and searched . 
  i can almost guarantee you this ; there are a lot more white people buying & selling drugs than black people in the united kingdom , especially buying . 
  but how many white friends do you know who got searched for suspicion of * simple possession * ? 
  they try to pull that * `` racial profiling that 's not really racist '' * down here in the south too , and we have a lot more black people , a lot more poor black people and a lot shittier social welfare net to catch those who fallin ' through the cracks . 
  ** and that shit still racist . 
  ** when the police down here fuck with me and i 'm with a lot of black people , two things happen : i 'm automatically a crackhead , because i 'm only one or two white people in the group ** or ** i 'm automatically a thugged out og because why else would this white boy be hangin ' out with all these black people like they 're his friends ? 
  ** edit : and for some reason , going off what you 're saying , it seems like the statistics show more black people committing crime because the police are searching and arresting more than their fair share of black people **, 
  ah fuck if he 's really a rastafarian and even a * `` little '' * religious * ( as opposed to just culturally rastafarian like many people are ` culturally ' christian ) * that shit must of been terrible for him . 
   i live in london , i 'm in my 20s , and i do n't know a single white person who has ever been stopped and searched . 
  --------------------------------------------------------  i think the argument about stop and search is not about racism --------------------------------------------------  i do however know multiple black people who 've been stopped and searched multiple times . 
  aye it was a good debate , 
  you 're not feeling me , ** i understand where the russians are coming from completely ** , i 'm just on the other side of the fence . 
   whomever 's fault it is for how it all started , russia has been trying to constantly expand it 's interests in the middle east , south america and other regions at the expense of the united states , so they 're just getting a taste of their own medicine . 
  morally i think we 're more justified than russia in ukraine , and realpolitikly i believe it 's in our interests , and those are the two checkboxs i need checked before i support any foreign meddling , both of which i believed have been checked . 
  we may have failed in syria * ( although obama agreeing to putin 's offer and the presence of american hard power which forced the offer to the table should not be ignored nor understated ) * , but i think ukraine has fallen squarely in the west 's favor . 
  ukraine is russia 's canada * ( except ... you know ... not as friendly & shit ) * . 
  imagine if america tried to drag canada into it 's sphere-of-influence , but failed , with one of the main reasons being a russian-led international coalition to oppose such a move , and instead we were forced to settle with either newfoundland or quebec * ( with a military invasion & annexation of course , which only goes to fire up the international coalition opposing us even more ) * ? 
  and it fucked our north american union so now it 's really basically just us & mexico . 
  oh , and it caused us to go into a recession . 
  ** would you call that a american victory ? 
  yeah , i 've seen him mentioned many a time , just need to put down the music and actually take the time out to put on the podcast if you know what i mean . 
   and yeah i agree , a lot of spanish speakers down here in florida , so the number of doors it could open for me is really cool , plus i 'll now know if people are talking about me or not . 
  :d the reason german piques my interest though is because it 's the most prominent language outside of english , but in the same family . 
  figured it might be easier than having to learn a romance language , but laziness has never been a good excuse for anything . 
  thanks for the recommendations though , history & language-wise . 
   ** edit : by the way the first line in that other post was supposed to be * `` i never learned german '' * and the last one is supposed to be * `` can you tell this was done on google translate ? 
  '' * ... . google really fucked that one up ... **, 
   is it just me or is obama absolutely reckless and clueless in regard to foreign policy ? 
  is he not listening to his advisors or are his advisors morons ? 
  -------------------------------------------  i guess ... you know ... russia learned the hard-way that it ca n't play the game like in the soviet days anymore and strong arm nations into their political unions ... ... it wanted all of ukraine , but was forced to seize only crimea instead ... at the cost of it 's economy ... so you know ... . the eurasian union is gon na be off to a good launch ... down a fundamental member-state and it 's leading member-state in recession ... and sure , spin it as a russian victory if you want . 
  but if you consider the impetus of the russian move to be because they felt nato & the eu were chipping away at their sphere-of-influence and surrounding them ... well ... them loosing all of ukraine with the exception of crimea is ... huh ... i would n't exactly call it a * `` victory '' * . 
  but you 're free to say what you wish , freedom of speech and expression and such . 
  you know ... unless it 's hate speech or libel depending on which country you 're in ... . but besides that yeah ... 
  ** edit : just re-translated this , and the first line is supposed to be * `` i never learned german '' * and the last one is supposed to be * `` can you tell this was done on google translate ? 
  '' * ... . google really fucked that one up ... **, 
  who knows what the cia knew , but the vibe i get is that we might of had our suspicions , but i do n't think anybody actually thought putin would jump , although it was still always possibility .

  yeah , but [ it 's not though unfortunately ] ( http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/news_focus/stop-and-search-in-holland-447.html ) . 
  sometimes [ our own countries surprise us ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/12/stop_and_search_policy_pays_of.php ) . 
  body searches . 
  ~ ~ * `` stop & frisk '' ~ ~ * `` stop & search '' * ( was thinking about new york 's bullshit law for a second , although pretty sure op meant the same ) means a cop can stop you walking on the street and search you because he notices something * `` suspicious '' * . 
  i saw a user here mention * `` high-risk '' * zones in the netherlands where they can do this , but i think he deleted his comment . 
   the language barrier alone !, 
  well thank god we got people like you learning english and breaking that barrier down for us !, 
  eh , nobody thought russia was going to do it .
