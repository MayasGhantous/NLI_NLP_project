  now we know . 
  crimea was one thing , the rest of the country is another . 
  good to see the kgb hard at work in eastern ukraine though . 
   probably the late & great / u/curtholiday who 's that ? 
  did he die ? 
  ** r.i.p. 
  ** it is !!!, 
  ** ha , it 's even in the same state as me !, 
  i love when foreigners take the time out of their day to learn a little about american geography . 
  :d makes me feel all warm inside and tingly in my special places . 
  it 's actually really funny because i was just doing a little research on the astroturfing you 're implying ; russians got a pretty good system , they do n't even use soldiers , they just pay civilians . 
   [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web_brigades#nashi_involvement )  in january 2012 a group that presented itself as the russian wing of the anonymous published a massive collection of what they claimed to be e-mails of former and present leaders of the pro-kremlin youth organization nashi ( including a number of government officials ) . 
  journalists who investigated the leaked information discovered numerous references to an army of paid commenters that reportedly operated in the fall of 2011 . 
  ** according to the e-mails , members of the `` brigades '' were paid 85 rubles ( about 3 us dollars ) or more per comment , depending on whether the comment received replies ; some were presented with ipads . 
  ** a number of high-profile bloggers were also mentioned as being paid for promoting nashi 's and government activities . 
  the federal youth agency whose head ( and the former leader of nashi ) vasily yakemenko was the highest-ranking individual targeted by the leaks refused to comment on authenticity of the e-mails .

  you must be mistaken , there were no russian soldiers in crimea . 
  ** edit : but seriously , i think the implication of what he 's saying is pretty understandable . 
  nobody thinks ukraine is going to get crimea back , but that does n't mean we should abandon the rest of ukraine because of it . 
  yep , [ the united states ] ( http://citizenjournal.info/wp-content/uploads/dictatorship-en.jpg ) was the [ sole reason ] ( http://maidantranslations.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/em_media-revoluyion_en.png ) . 
  i mean [ seriously ] ( http://www.sampsoniaway.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ukraine_weaponsagainstmedianfographic_10feb2014_iimi-e1392595960113.jpg ) , there was absolutely [ no other reason ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26868119 ) . 
  did you see all those undercover cia agents posing as protesters ? 
  or the absolute shit-load of cash we were pumping into there ? 
  i know because some group posted a video of a [ protester saying such after having his ear chopped off ] ( http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/31/22520784-ukraine-activist-says-kidnappers-tortured-him-cut-off-part-of-his-ear?lite ) . 
  of course , russia acted completely appropriately by invading the country and annexing a region of it . 
  while wearing no identifying marks & denying it the whole time . 
  ** i could n't agree with you more . 
  :( r.i.p. 
  nah , just a american living in the deep south with a great interest in the western world in general , although i will admit , i do enjoy learning about and discussing europe more than the anglosphere . 
  given the eu 's inaction and indecisiveness at the beginning of the crisis , you ca n't really blame nuland for the whole * `` fuck the eu , we 'll seek support from the un '' * line . 
  * note : quote was paraphrased *, 
   the ukraine crisis is threatening investment in russia , the imf said ------------------------------------------------------------  ** russia is `` experiencing recession now '' because of damage caused by the ukraine crisis , the international monetary fund ( imf ) has said . 
  ** -------------------------------------------------------------  the fund , which cut its growth forecast for russia , said $ 100bn ( # 59bn ) would leave the country this year . 
   the u.s. embassy in ukraine condemned the recent violence in eastern ukraine by pro-russian militants as * `` terrorism , pure and simple . 
  '' * u.s. 
  ambassador geoffrey pyatt spoke tuesday at a press conference , warning that a russian invasion into ukraine would merit an instantaneous response from the u.s. 
  never said that * ( i get the joke by the way lol ) * , but if it was n't for us , austria would n't nearly have recovered as strongly and as fast as it did following wwii . 
  to be honest , i never understood the * hate * napoleon gets in general . 
  i mean , he hijacked the revolution to forge a empire , but fuck if he did n't keep the ideals of the revolution in some form or another , and damn if he was n't a better leader than people like robespierre . 
  the way he stabilized the state after such a traumatic period ... and went on to conquer most of europe , to unite it ... and implemented the napoleonic code across it ... thus paving the way for many of our modern legal systems ... and that 's just one of the few progressive things he did for the entire continent . 
  plus , he sold us like ... 1/3rd of the continental united states for the cheap ... which was pretty bitchin ' ... really , he 's one of my heros . 
  what other fiat currency is more stable than ours ? 
  we have the largest gold reserves , the largest national economy * ( with a much stronger fiscal/currency union than the eurozone ) * , mutual defense pacts * ( or simply just strong relations like with taiwan ) * with a couple large asian powers * ( japan & south korea specifically ) * to ward off chinese influence for a little * ( and probably for the foreseeable future when it comes to japan , the 3rd largest economy in the world ) * and the petrodollar to boot . 
  united states bonds are what much of the 1st world , and developing world * ( looking at you china ) * invest in ... and they can only be paid back in usd iirc ... 
  i just ... i do n't know where he 's coming from ... 
  we did n't make you lose the first world war ; * lulz * you did that shit yourself when you mismanaged your empire for decades , got yourself involved in a war which you were n't ready for and then got bogged down in serbia and your army smashed by russia . 
  america did n't make you lose that war , germany just delayed the inevitable when they came to save your ass . 
  i do n't want to go into politics ; though i think the points i make are still valid . 
  and i just hope the american fighters patrolling the baltics and protecting your airspace do n't start wwiii because russia wants to add you to it 's sphere-of-influence . 
  it 's ... not refusal ... nafta is more akin to the eu 's deal with switzerland or norway ... and even then ... the nafta does n't guarantee free movement like them * ( hence the whole eu-switzerland debacle with the referendum if you have n't been paying attention to the news ) * . 
  i mean ... do you really think that the european free trade area is synonymous with the european union ? 
  well i like to think it 's a cooperative thing , you give a little something on the week-days , but we provide a little something on the weekends which i know she values . 
  an i mean , * we are * the richest person on the block ... if you do n't count that weird ass communal living thing you guys got going over there....half-hostel , half-hotel ... i have n't really gotten to understanding it completely yet ... 
  yeah ... that was rather stupid ... especially when you consider the red army was probably the most combat effective force at the time , years of combat experience , operating under war-time conditions and huge reserves of veterans to draw upon . 
  other countries had similiar attributes , but none which the eastern front could provide * ( not to say it 's a good thing , all of that shit came at a cost no nation should be burdened with ) * . 
  nah , if you were winston churchill you 'd be feeling me 300 . 
  than again ... churchill had some really ballsy , off-the-wall ideas ... like invading the soviets as soon as the nazis surrendered ... . so ... i do n't know if i 'd want that dude in peace time when you 're trying to avoid war ... 
  yeah , i 've heard , i 've heard ; thinkin ' about just giving her the silent treatment , you know ? 
  maybe cutting off the allowance a little ? 
  hence why i said * `` some countrymen '' * . 
  and it seems your government feels the same way , given it 's going against the advice of the european parliament . 
  and ... you say the path of the eu is dominated by the majority ... well if the european parliament represents the people ... and it does n't want to go in this direction ... i think the majority actually disagrees with you from a eu-wide perspective ... 
  i do n't think i ever stopped  an i never really disliked russia , she 's always been a vixen , an i always respected her for what she was , but you know ... she has n't really been making the right decisions as of late ... and i just ca n't really afford to go soft on her . 
  tough love , you know ? 
  if sanctioning russia does nothing , and the other option is doing nothing , might as well go with the sanctioning to send a message . 
  you ca n't just sit by and allow russia to carve out spheres-of-influence at your own expense to * `` satisfy '' * them . 
  shit 's no different than appeasement in my mind , and i 'm not into that . 
  and europe might hurt economically by taking a hard stance , but that 's the price it pays for being so dependent on russian gas . 
  change that if you want to stop the hurt . 
  an as for your last point , it 's really not that bold at all . 
  i suggest you look at some of your countrymen 's replies in this thread alone ; there seems to be a lot of animosity between the eu trying to influence austria away from this and austria asserting it 's national sovereignty through a independent foreign policy * ( nothing wrong with that , just pointing out that austria & eu interests do collide , or at least , that 's how some austrians appear to see it , and they do n't like the pushing the eu is doing ) * . 
  in retrospect , you 're right , but the statement was made in response to any potential war with china where china takes advantage of that ... . but china would n't be able to go to war because they 'd be as fucked as us ... 
  so yeah , you 're right and i was wrong on that . 
  lol, 
  never denied that ; it was in our interests . 
  though i 'm sure morality played a factor as well , in concert with the realpolitik interests . 
  the point is though ... ** we did it & it helped you ** ... which is my point ... we 've done more for europe than russia has done for europe , and in my personal interests , it 's more in the interests of the eu to align with the united states in comparison to russia . 
  heh , perhaps not helping was a bad choice of words , just not caring is a better one . 
  although , even that might be wrong , because you seem to sincerely believe that this will help the eu ; so i apologize if i mischaracterized you . 
  but personally , it seems more like austria is pushing it 's own national interests at the determinant of the european union as whole , and specifically , the determinant of eastern european member-states . 
  no , it 's not . 
  and it wo n't be hard for certain groups to gain traction in states calling for secession , it 'll be less difficult for them to seize federal armories and such , and much harder for the government to stop them . 
  i do n't even wan na think about the nuclear arsenal , let alone the nuclear arsenals of countries like pakistan . 
  it 's a downside for everybody when you think about it ... . like i said ... basically everybody 's fucked really ... 
  never said that ; but it was in our interests , and morality did play a factor . 
  ** and it did help you at a cost to us . 
  ** even if , like i said , we got other benefits through increased influence and stronger alliances in the region to help counter the soviet bloc . 
  but i think we 've done more for europe than russia , that 's for sure , and that 's my point . 
  in such a scenario , i do n't think you should trust germany . 
  or france . 
  or china . 
  or austria . 
  or poland . 
  or anybody really . 
  we 're talking about a complete collapse of the entire world economy . 
  the entire international framework we 've worked damn near almost a century to establish , maintain & balance . 
  it 's not a american thing , it 's a human thing . 
  when such extreme and widespread disaster strikes , chaos and violence follow . 
  i think that 's the time everybody will use their guns .
