  yes , but if the usd collapses , than chances are , the entire world economy collapses and china , ** especially china ** , is in as much of a rut as we are . 
  hard to get back all that money we owe you in such a situation . 
  an when the united states sneezes , europe * ( as in the eu ) * catches a cold . 
  there 's a reason this recession was triggered by us , but europe only exited it last year . 
  now ... imagine ... a world where china , the european union and america collapse economically . 
  the three most important pillars of the world economy ... . gone . 
  everybody 's fucked . 
  ... you 're still comparing nafta to the eu ... and ... it 's not going to work ... 
  like i mentioned above , if you have a problem with personifications , you are ** fucked ** when you get to analogies and metaphors . 
  china is going to grow $ 7 trillion dollars in a single year ? 
  when did they get a 80-90 % gdp growth rate ? 
  am ... am i not a american ? 
  have you never referred to british achievements in the past as * `` we '' * ? 
  to british mistakes in the past as * `` we '' * ? 
  is it wrong for me to have a sense of national identity and unity ? 
  anyway , stop being so pedantic , it wo n't get you anywhere in life you want to go ... or at the very least ... anywhere where somebody wants to go with you ... 
  i never said it did , just pointed out the comparison between nafta & eu was retarded . 
  nor did i ever imply that austria * did n't * have a independent foreign policy , only said if they did n't want the eu to pursue the interests of the eu , while having such influence over their own country , they should n't of ever joined the eu in the first-place . 
   nabucco was supposed to be provided with gas from iraq . 
  and the [ south caucasus pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_caucasus_pipeline ) from the [ shah deniz gas field ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shah_deniz_gas_field#pipeline ) ? 
  and like i said ... europe seems to have no problem getting oil from iraq ... natural gas should n't be that much more different . 
  though like i said , i understand why they would n't ... which is why i pointed out the gasfield in azerbaijan and the pipeline that basically goes through only allied or nato member-states . 
   ah yes . 
  americans do n't like the polish much still , forgot . 
  they will still accept you traveling there . 
  not sure where you get the idea from that i would not care about the polish . 
   i do wonder though if you have actually been to either poland , russia ( or for that matter any eastern european country ) to judge the situation yourself or if you are just making your mind up from what you read on twitter and cnn . 
  yeah , we hate the poles so much we have a minuscule polish community and never send soldiers when they request assistance and reinforcement to deter russian threats . 
  but something tells me you would n't care much about helping fellow eu member-states ... . . 
  no , they have bothered us , by bothering the countries we have mutual defense pacts with . 
  this endangers the institutional framework i was talking about before with the united states at the forefront . 
  i am against this . 
  and no , we should n't leave nato or abandon our mutual defense treaties with japan , the philippines or south korea . 
  i do n't think isolationism is in our interests . 
  but yes , we are a super power . 
  money might be fiat and * `` not real '' * but the guns , tanks , ship & planes sure as fuck are . 
  and i think right now we can deter both russia & china , but that 's going to become more & more difficult as china rises , which is why i want to see the european union consolidate & integrate so it can take care of it 's backyard and the united states does n't feel as obligated to get involved in the region because of nato . 
  it 's distracting from our * `` pivot to the pacific '' * to counter china . 
  and ... i kinda doubt china is gon na fuck me and everybody else up ... but you 're free to believe that . 
   compete with on equal ground in at least half-a-century ? 
  sure . 
  perhaps surpass in global influence in at least a century ? 
  sure , why not . 
  fuck up ? 
  * lulz * and it 's hard to get your money back from somebody when you 're at war with them ... . and we owe china a fuckton more money than china owes us ... . . 
  but like i said , you 're free to believe what you want to believe . 
  yeah , * lulz * , remember when nafta created a institutional framework for a [ executive ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_commission ) , [ legislative ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament ) & [ judicial branch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/court_of_justice_of_the_european_union ) ? 
  remember how nafta 's legislature can pass laws that [ have supremacy over national laws ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_law#supremacy ) ? 
  [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan#effects_and_legacy )  the years 1948 to 1952 saw the fastest period of growth in european history . 
  industrial production increased by 35 % . 
  agricultural production substantially surpassed pre-war levels . 
  the poverty and starvation of the immediate postwar years disappeared , and western europe embarked upon an unprecedented two decades of growth that saw standards of living increase dramatically . 
  there is some debate among historians over how much this should be credited to the marshall plan . 
  most reject the idea that it alone miraculously revived europe , as evidence shows that a general recovery was already underway . 
  most believe that the marshall plan sped this recovery , but did not initiate it . 
  the united states worked to direct the marshall plan towards children and an increase of nutritional material for all citizens within western europe so as to shed a positive light on its goals as it worked to effectively defeat communist threats . 
  one effect of the plan was that it subtly `` americanized '' countries , ** especially austria ** , who embraced united states ' assistance , through popular culture , such as hollywood movies and rock n ' roll . 
  i 'm sure all of this was coincidental , and like you said , the marshall plan did fuck all & was insignificant . 
   in case you have not noticed , the discussion is about gas and not oil . 
  how did iraq fuck over azerbaijan & turkey again ? 
  the only one who seems to have fucked with that specific region is russia with the georgian war * ( i 'm not giving my personal opinion on it , just stating it as fact ) * . 
  i think chechnya is closer to there than iraq as well . 
   which country in the eu can you not go visa free to as american ? 
   which ( non new ) eu country does not have visa free travel to the us ? 
  poland for one ... but given your other comments ... i do n't think you care much for poland , let alone it 's interests , anyway ... . .  the free trade agreement is mostly uninteresting for the amount of influence the us already had . 
  you have access to our data and bank accounts , you already have no customs on almost everything excluding agricultural products . 
  eh , your countries ' helped and if you ca n't see how free trade between the two largest economies in the world , who are each other 's largest trading partners , is significant well ... i ca n't help you dude ...  i 'm standing in the line of sensible politics in europe without risking a war . 
  something americans are clearly not very concerned about because all their war games play so far from home . 
  it 's great that austria is n't in nato , but like i said , you agreed to the common security & defense policy . 
  if anything , it should be austrian soldiers responding to eastern europe 's request for reinforcement instead of americans ...  european countries already depend on a lot of other things from other countries . 
  austria depends on nuclear power , on the money of tourists , the internet infrastructure of the americans etc. 
  if we do n't see russia as an enemy then depending on a chunk of gas from them is not nearly as big of an issue as you make it out to be . 
  oh , that 's great logic . 
  we get our internet infrastructure from america , so we should get all our natural gas from russia , because that dependence on america * worked so well * ... . 
  you realize that was a ** reply to a guy who personified me as the united states ** , right ? 
  check the [ context ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24bvuf/david_cameron_pledged_tonight_to_step_down_as/ch5uy2z ) before you comment . 
   i mean . . who the fuck are you , to interfere with other countries ? 
  and why do you think it 's your job to `` save the world '' ? 
  i really don ; t know where you get this idea from ? 
  perhaps your government suggested it so they could profit from foreign war ? 
  ( which incidentally often kills a lot of your soldiers ... why on earth would you be interested in that ? 
  if your worried about terrorism . . simply don ; t allow terrorists near your country ? 
  maybe i should n't of replied in kind , but i thought it was fair and simple enough that people would n't confuse the two of us as actual countries . 
  i was hoping the same logic worked here . 
  but i do agree perhaps i could 've worded it better , as with my reply here . 
  although the main point i was trying to get across still stands completely in my opinion , in both threads , this one & that one . 
  you can browse / r/shitamericanssay all day , but if you do n't understand the context , you should n't comment . 
  ** edit : and for people who are only reading the quotes , the whole debate started over the guy getting mad at me for saying , as a american , i 'd rather the united kingdom remain inside the european union **, 
  the european parliament is looking out for the interests of the ** european union ** . 
  that includes * all of it 's member-states * . 
  if austria did n't want the european union to look out for the interests of the entire european union , and instead wanted it to put the interests of a single member-state ahead of the rest of the pack ... well ... austria should 've never joined the european union in the first place then ... 
   we tried to diversify our supply but the iraq war pretty much killed that project . 
  which we did not participate in . 
  which is why the majority of companies extracting oil from iraq are european & chinese ? 
   i 'm pretty sure the majority of europeans would support a good relationship with russia . 
  that includes eastern europe . 
  i was a good relationship with russia too . 
  but i do not want to bend over for russia . 
   we do n't even have a visa free regime with russia , no trade agreements etc. 
  the only thing that we have with russia is energy trading .
