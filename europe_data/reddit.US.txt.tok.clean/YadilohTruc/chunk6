  you 're way out of line . 
  does all of europe have a visa-free regime with america ? 
  has ... has the us-eu fta been signed ? 
  * i do n't think so ... * if anything , you do n't know what line you 're standing in . 
  and yeah dude , energy dependence is totally insignificant . 
  my apologies . 
  i think the point i was trying to get across was simple enough . 
  personification is a conversational tool in helping people understand context . 
  it 's no different than a analogy . 
  yeah man , like i said , the best way to achieve that is to increase your dependence on russian gas instead of diversifying your supply so your not so beholden to a single country . 
  and like i said , i 'm sure this will bode * amazingly well * with certain eu member-states in eastern europe and will in no way negatively impact or hinder eu foreign policy when it 's in competition with russia in the region . 
  and if it does , so what ? 
  appeasement is better than standing up for your fellow member-states interests in eastern europe and the interests of the european union overall . 
  it 's amazing how you can deplore the amount of influence that america has over the eu ... and then bend over for russia immediately after the words leave your mouth ... . 
  i do n't think you quite understand what * `` southstream '' * is if you think it 's a project who 's effects will be restricted solely to austria . 
  i apologize for calling you stupid , i do , it was immature and childish ; i should n't be getting all emotional and shit like that with the indirect insults . 
  so i do apologize . 
  but i still think it 's relevant given the context . 
  no dude , awesome idea , awesome idea . 
  i 'm sure your eastern european member-states will love that . 
  and i 'm glad russia contributed as much to western europe as we have ... like you know ... it 's not like the little shit we did mattered ... like the marshall plan which helped rebuild western europe ... or the fact we garrisoned the fulda gap for damn-near half-a-century ... talking about the marshall plan ... . . [ your country did n't happen to receive any funds , did it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan#expenditures ) ? 
  ** you are the european union ** you can vote in their elections , you in-directly elect the council & commission , and you are a eu citizen . 
  but yeah , totes dude , what the european union * definitely * needs is more dependence on russian gas . 
  that wo n't backfire at all . 
  hey , maybe faymann might even get a nice little gazprom job like schroeder did after he left office ? 
  yes , and i do n't know much about uk politics outside of a basic understanding of it 's parliamentary system * ( shit gets even fuzzier for me when it comes to devolved powers for ni , scotland & wales ) * and three main political parties . 
  but it just seems to me , even if you do n't support the reforms cameron wants for the european union , you should at least support * his want to stay in the eu * . 
  it may be insincere or not , but i see many people , people i 've seen in other threads being supportive of the eu , deriding even that . 
  well ... not * what * he 's saying ... but just * how * he 's saying it ... which may be different , but i believe it still weakens the pro-eu camp in a way . 
  i was actually talking about the european parliament , but this is just as informative , if not more so , in helping me understand the situation , so thanks for that . 
  lol, 
  foreign policy and relationships are a lot stronger than trade agreements . 
  somebody who supports the united kingdom leaving the european union should be the first to realize that . 
   and who the fuck am i ? 
  the world 's only remaining super power , the largest national economy in the world , the most capable military in the world * ( when it comes to power projection ) * and a u.n. security council member . 
  you are a former empire which has shrunk down to a area a little larger than oregon , with a population & economy closer to california than either germany or japan . 
  one who only keeps their unsc seat because of tradition rather than practicality . 
  we have just as much right as anybody else to get involved in the foreign arena , and whether you like it or not , great powers dictate how the world spins , and it is in my interests to make sure the united states remains at the forefront of that framework for as long as possible * ( it 's at least half-a-century before china can truly challenge us and at least a century before they can truly surpass us in precedence ) * . 
  the only one who can get to be on the same footing as us in a shorter time than china is the european union , which i would prefer as a counter-balance to china & russia ; as our interests will more than likely align much more than with either of them * ( china & russia ) * . 
  yes , but what 's wrong with supporting cameron 's position on keeping the united kingdom in the eu , and then when another pm comes along using him to push reform ? 
  even when it 's not about eu reform and it 's just cameron trying to garner support to remain in the eu , i see people , who are usually pro-eu , deride every position he takes on the issue , no matter what it is . 
  it reminds me of my own country 's partisanship . 
  yes , but he ca n't change the eu without support of the other eu nations * ( and parliament i guess ? 
  do n't really know about much unilateral power the council has ) * . 
  now , i 'm not commenting on his domestic policy , because i do n't know shit about it , but he does seem to be the strongest voice in the united kingdom when it comes to it remaining in the eu . 
  heh , never looked at it from that angle , though it does sound like dangerous game to play ... 
  there 's nothing wrong with the ukip for the supporters of the ukip . 
  that 's their democratic choice and expression . 
  i hope we will always have good relations with the united kingdom , but that said , i 'd rather our strongest ally in europe be * in * the european union than * outside * the european union . 
  we can find a lot more common ground with france than germany when it comes to foreign policy , but not as much as with the united kingdom * ( syria was the exception which proved the rule ) * . 
  that 's why i , as a american , oppose the ukip . 
  but british citizens are british citizens and there 's absolutely nothing wrong with them voting to put their country on that course , but once again , i as a american have to disagree because i believe it will damage our influence and relationship with the continent * ( eastern europe are still strong allies , but they never have had , nor do i believe ever-will have , the strong relationship we share with the united kingdom ) * . 
  well there 's some ukranians on this site who just had their country invaded ... 
  i could n't possibly know why they would ** ever ** label putin a * `` enemy '' * , military invasions that annex entire regions of your country are clearly more that of a * `` neutral '' * , hell , maybe even a * `` friend '' * if russia 's media is to be believed . 
  oh , did germany stop being a democratic country ? 
  yeah , latvia should totally just withdraw from nato and rely on the eu 's common defense & security policy . 
  that would be a master-stroke . 
  and germany 's past foreign policy probably gives them such confidence in one of the closest of the eu 's big 5 which can help them  * lulz *, 
   i know you guys have a faible for the usa , because they are basically the only reason why your country still exists . 
  only reason your country still exists too if you 've forgotten  quick to ignore the fact we still got to germany before the soviets could occupy all of it & then garrisoned the fulda gap for damn near half-a-century to prevent it 's annexation . 
   or ... wait ... is your present government * not * directly derived from west germany ? 
  did ... did east germany * not * dissolve itself and accede to the federal republic of germany after the cold war ended & the soviet bloc collapsed ? 
  man , he sold out before that . 
  no way you sign something like nordstream into law in the * very last days of your administration * , when you 're on your way out , guaranteeing up $ 1 billion in it 's construction costs , and then magically get a gazprom chairmanship as soon as you get out of office . 
  well considering he 's chairing the gazprom subsidary which is building nordstream ... which he signed into law as chancellor & had germany gurantee up to $ 1 billion in costs of ... * than yes * ... . this can be considered very political ... 
  especially when you remember this event was * hosted by gazprom * & the * russian president * is in attendance . 
  both very political in themselves . 
  the foreign audience is a much different one than the domestic audience . 
   at least in the eyes of the government . 
  ** it was n't private-in-a-sense , it was a official event hosted by gazprom , and the article itself is a editorial . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  ** an well ... you know ... it 's a event between a former german chancellor & the russian president ... while the relationship between russia & germany is at the worst it 's been since the cold war ... not to mention it reiterates the fact that schroeder signed nordstream into law in the last days of his administration , having germany cover up to $ 1 billion of it 's construction costs ... despite it posing security/intelligence threat to sweden & the possibility it could be used to economically isolate poland & other eastern european countries ... and then putin giving him the chairmanship of the gazprom subsidiary building the entire project ... . you got ta be pretty god damn stupid to not think this is relevant ... . . 
  has this man made detective yet god dammit !!!?!!? 
  damn fine work mark !, 
  damn fine work !, 
  remember austria you 're no longer fucking with the energy security and economic interests of * foreign * nato member-states , but instead now with * fellow * eu member-states . 
  your * `` neutrality '' * went out the window the day you joined the european union , specifically when you agreed to the common security & defense policy . 
  you realize that by dividing the pro-eu camp & procrastinating on a referendum , you 're just going to push the ukip up in the polls , right ? 
  wtf are all you people hating on cameron so hard for when it comes to the european union ? 
  i mean ... i get it if you 're supporting ukip ... but if you 're not ... can you really be this foolish ? 
  yeah , he has some eu reform ideas which you can disagree with , that 's fine , ** but he 's actively trying to keep the uk in the eu ** . 
  like ... he 's the most authoritative and influential voice on the matter in opposition to the ukip and ya 'll are throwing him under the bus ... you wonder why the ukip is gaining in polls and it 's because the people who want to stay in the eu do n't even want to * support the stances of people trying to keep it in the eu * . 
  the camp is divided . 
  i did n't like bush , but if the dude put forward a policy i supported , i supported it . 
  i like obama , but if he puts forward policy i 'm against , i 'm not going to support it . 
  there might not be a long-term if the united kingdom leaves in the middle of economically stagnant period during the european union 's formative years . 
  the council is the upper house , the commission is the executive branch which shares power with the council , but only the commission can propose bills . 
  shit gets confusing . 
  i do n't think you quite understand how important one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the eu is , 
  ** lulz ... nah ... ** europe , as it is now , has a [ ageing population ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aging_of_europe ) which it desperately needs to correct . 
  it has a decrease in fertility , a decrease in mortality rate , and a higher life expectancy , all of which will only stress and put more burden on many european countries economies * ( as well as increase their debt ) * . 
  [ by 2050 , an estimated 35 % of the european population will be over the age of 60 . 
  ] ( http://www.thematuremarket.com/seniorstrategic/ageing_population_european_facts-6204-5.html ) compare this to the united states , which has a [ population growth rate ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=united+states+population+growth&amp;oq=united+states+population+growth&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.7604j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=utf-8 ) close to 3.5 x that of [ europe ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/european_union/population_growth_rate.html ) . 
  by 2050 close to [ 20 % of the population ] ( http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/776.full ) is predicted to be over the age of 60 , which while not ideal , is still 15 % better than europe , or , in short , a 1/5th of the american population compared to europe 's 1/3rd . 
  economically , we are also faring rather well . 
  [ america came out of the recession four years ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_great_recession ) , the european union did as well , but had [ a double-dip recession ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession ) shortly afterwards , [ which it only exited from last august ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-exit-double-dip-recession ) . 
  in short , we * ( america ) * still have years of growth * ( albeit small ) * while europe as a whole still has years of recession/loss looming over it 's head . 
  we 've reached pre-2008 levels this year iirc , but europe still has a long way to go before it regains the ground it 's lost . 
  plus , america had a 2013 [ gdp growth of 2.6 % ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=united+states+annual+gdp+growth+rate&amp;oq=united+states+annual+gdp+growth+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.15017j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=utf-8 ) , compared to the european union 's 2013 [ gdp growth of .2 % ] ( http://rt.com/business/eu-gdp-q3-eurostat-707/ ) ( remember , the e.u. 
  was in recession in 2012 ) .
