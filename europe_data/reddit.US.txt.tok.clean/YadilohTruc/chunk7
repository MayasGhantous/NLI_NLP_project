  and since our growth has remained relatively stable , our economy is growing at something like 12x that of europe . 
  and our 2013 growth numbers are supposed to be even higher , so expect that multiple to rise . 
  if iirc , we 're even projected to surpass the european union 's economy by 2020 . 
  unemployment wise , the european union has a [ unemployment rate of 10.9 % ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=european+union+unemployment+rate&amp;oq=european+union+unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5239j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=utf-8 ) and the eurozone an unemployment rate of [ 12.1 % , which is projected to go up to 12.3 percent ] ( http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636 ) by the end of the year . 
  the united states has [ a unemployment rate of 7.3 % ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=united+states+unemployment+rate&amp;oq=united+states+unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5218j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=utf-8 ) , which is projected to [ fall below 7 % ] ( http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636 ) by the end of the year . 
  oh , and to top it off , as you might 've already seen , [ the imf predicts we 'll surpass the eu 's economy in a couple years ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/01/pdf/text.pdf ) . 
  * lulz * `` do n't act act all high and mighty because you were there even though the other guy just said you were n't there . '', 
  great logic there dude , great logic . 
  i never said it was a popular opinion , only that it was a possible one . 
  nobody would 've ever agreed to the eu three decades ago , hell , i down think many would agree with it 's present form two decades ago , but it happened . 
  and nafta * did happen * already , so that 's one piece of the puzzle , we just need to build on it . 
   and for a * `` neutral '' * greek , you sure have crawled yourself a good way up china & russia 's asshole . 
  cool , cool . 
  maybe one day ? 
  it 's not like we do n't have extremely similiar cultures , are each apart of the anglosphere and both share the same language ? 
  and share a massive border ? 
  and they 'd have a large say in it with 16 senators and a good number of representatives to sway the debate , not to mention the allies they 'll find in the border states , north-east in general & california . 
  fuck , the european union in it 's present form was a pipe dream a couple decades ago . 
  an not as much riots on the streets when you participate in the goverment and are represented democratically . 
  just because your country loses it 's fucking shit every time the eu passes a law and invokes supremacy does n't mean our countries will . 
  * lulz * and it 's cute you think china would create a reserve currency * with russia * instead of in * competition with russia * . 
  really , that 's adorable . 
  and good thing china & russia are so much more economically entwined than china & the united states . 
  :d the only competition is china , and even then , they will not be on the same level as us for at least another 50 years , and they wo n't surpass us for at least another 100 . 
  america is n't like the colonial empires of the past . 
  we 're not going to magically shrink down the size of oregon with a population a little bigger than california . 
  the united states should n't get involved in ukraine directly . 
  it 's a step too far . 
  but we should be supplying the ukrainian military with arms , equipment and up-to-date intelligence to give them some kind of fighting chance if things do get hot . 
  perhaps training as well in nato baltic states . 
  and you 're right , which is why i was confused by your stance . 
  because the fulda gap would 've been a focal point of any soviet invasion against nato , and the united states garrisoned that position for damn-near half-a-century , across the line from the soviets , who were much stronger and whom had a much more capable military * ( relative to the times ) * than russian today * ( and whom actually , for most of that half-a-century , had the advantage against us ) * . 
  we were willing to die and defend your country then , even at the cost of nuclear holocaust , and we 'll do the same for poland . 
  so yes , if poland is attacked , we will move to strike russia in poland 's defense , as is our obligation per * article v * of nato . 
  plus , if we do n't , our whole * `` pivot to the pacific '' * is fucked . 
  japan , the philippines , south korea , singapore , australia , our relationship with all of them is pretty much fucked . 
  if we did n't defend a nato member-state , why would they think we would defend them ? 
  we might as well just come back to the continent and go isolationist and shit . 
  it makes no sense , whether talking realpolitiks or morally . 
  it 's against our national interests * to not * help a nato ally and morally it 's inexcusable . 
  ** edit : and the context of the statement was n't about ukraine , it was about poland , which is the country the guy you replied to was referring too ( * even if i myself did n't like his tone or statement * ) **, 
  yes , america will attack russia to defend a ally . 
  somebody in the same country as the fulda gap should know that . 
  well i mean yeah , but surely we can find a balance ? 
  one that is not unnecessarily burdening on the population , but one which provides just enough of a social safety net to help those who fall through the cracks ? 
  some way to preserve competition & the free market , while also helping the worst off and not ignoring/abandoning them ? 
  * lulz * that 's funny coming from a guy in the same country as the fulda gap . 
  what ? 
  i do n't follow ... 
  yes , but personally , i really believe that we need a stronger safety net here , perhaps not as extensive as some european countries , but stronger none-the-less . 
  i would n't mind a single-payer healthcare system at all , but i agree on certain business regulations and shit in europe , as starting a business there in many countries is fucking ridiculous and the amount of red-tape/associated costs i 've heard about , especially when it comes to firing a shitty employee , sounds damn near unbearable . 
  but i just do n't see how europe can keep it 's extensive welfare states afloat with these kind of demographics . 
  it just does n't make sense financially . 
  you guys need to figure out something fast or start fucking more or switch to robotics or some shit because if the population growth is n't fixed the future generations are going to be fucking swamped in debt/taxes worse than now . 
  as is the ever-mighty australia . 
  we are but a stone 's throw away from mexistralian domination on a level we could not even contemplate . 
  except for ... you know ... the u.s. f-16s already in the baltic , the u.s. troops already in your country , the immediate response of a u.s. ship in the black sea and the holding of military exercises with your country and other eastern european countries ... than yeah ... i guess you 're right in some imagined scenario ... and the eu * should be doing * all that other shit . 
  it 's not a failure of the united states to not manage your own back yard better than you , our only job is to protect you , which i think we 're pretty fucking committed to and our stance on the issue is rather clear . 
   but ugh , how 's nordstream going and that fellow schroeder ? 
  good allies you got there in the eu , always considering polish interests and the interests of the eu as a whole before making strategically vital decisions that can affect your security & economic stability . 
  yes , but ** debt accumulates ** . 
  shit cost money , even if you 're not * directly * paying for it . 
  what do you think taxes are for ? 
  honestly , i really just do n't think you quite understand this whole thing about * pensions * and * money * and * a small amount of people owing a fuck-ton of money * . 
  but europe has a shit-load more old people than young people ... that does n't translate to more open jobs ... it translates to not enough people to fill enough jobs , less money to tax and more burden placed on the younger generations to support the older ones . 
  i do n't think you quite understand how this works ... 
  if you have more people retiring than employed , if you have more old people than young people , ** the burden on the middle & working class increases ** because there 's less income overall to tax to maintain the pensioners . 
  i do n't care if you 're capitalist , socialist or communist ; those numbers ar n't good dude . 
  yeah , but this dude is being serious . 
  like , whether you 're a socialist or a capitalist , hell , even if you 're a communist , you know those statistics ar n't good . 
  no matter what side of the political spectrum you fall on . 
  * ... * ** kinda ** . 
  but yeah . 
  although it 's probably more like a early , more independent-minded texas which actually * might 've * left if * it could * . 
  texas ' annexation was half willingly/half a proverbial gun to their head . 
  the difference here being , the united kingdom * actually can leave * because it does n't have the implication of armed conflict hanging over it 's head . 
  so the stakes are kinda higher . 
  the last time texas tried to secede , the union beat them back into the union , but who 's gon na stop the united kingdom if they decide to leave ? 
   but i do n't think the united kingdom will leave , or hopefully it wo n't , so in that scenario yeah , it 's like a modern-day texas . 
  * old people * = ** retire & go on welfare ** * young people * = ** unemployed & go on welfare ** ** we broke cuh !, 
  ** something ... something like that ... 
  i do n't know ... but apparently it worked for us ? 
  so if you want to compete , get to eating boy . 
  this is very true ; but to be honest , as a american , i do n't want to see one of our strongest allies and mother nation split in two , it 's influence significantly waned . 
  i. ... i do n't think that 's a good thing ... ** edit : i 'm being downvoted ... can ... can the people downvoting do like ... basic mathematics ? 
  you think pensions and retirement funds are * free * ? 
  that the cost wo n't pass down to your children * ( which many of ya 'll probably do n't have ... which is the root of the problem ) * ? 
  you think this shit is just ignored ? 
  that a smaller working population forced to support a much larger retiring population wo n't be burdened ? 
  ya 'll downvoting are weird ... ** ** edit2 : alright ... it turned around . . maybe i talked too soon **, 
  no , the eu has a treaty pretending to be a constitution and it 's doing a half-assed job at it . 
  nope , legal to grow and distribute in colorado . 
  legal growhouses and dispensaries are popping up all over the state . 
  all private business . 
  the sellers are approved , but so are liquor stores . 
  regulation comes with legalization . 
   it 's the same situation in washington i believe ... but they just have no regulations in place for growers & distributor ... so everybody is just doing what they 've always done ... and since washington did n't have the regulations & infrastructure in place like colorado , they 're missing out on all that juicy tax revenue ... but iirc they 're moving to change that . 
  lol basically , but you do n't buy it from the doctors , only get the medical license from the doctor , and buy it from a state-authorized dispensaries run by private companies * ( iirc ) * ... so basically ... * de facto * legalization . 
  and chances are you 're going in there asking for weed and using some bullshit excuse like a sore throat . 
  :p i do n't really like the system , because it conflates normal potheads with cancer patients , but i wo n't deny that without it & the precedent it set , colorado & washington would 've probably never legalized like they did and when they did .
