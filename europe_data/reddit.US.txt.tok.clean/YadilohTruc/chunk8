  so you know , good with the bad . 
  which would be like impeaching a president or shoving out a prime minister . 
  shit is harder than it looks . 
  plus , remember , the commission can just guarantee to propose only the bills of a side he favors at the moment or chooses at the moment ; even if that side is n't the majority , it can be used to save him from a vote of no confidence , especially in a multi-party system . 
  nah , you can go in the store and buy it . 
  legal grow-houses and dispensaries have been popping up all over colorado , the only proof you need is you i.d. 
  for age iirc . 
  washington is a different story though ... idk why ... but it seems they just did n't have the infrastructure in place . 
  so it 's completely legal ... but everybody is just doing it through their old networks ... which means the government is n't able to tax it like colorado is ... i 'm still happy that washington legalized , but they should 've been more prepared like colorado . 
  that said , iirc , they are taking slow , but steady steps to getting to colorado 's level , so that 's a plus . 
  ** edit : ** and on a fucked up note , many california growers are actually * against * legalizing weed there like in colorado & washington because it 'd fuck up their market share in their state 's medicinal marijuana market ... but in california you can get a medical marijuana card for * anything * , you 'd literally have to be retarded to not be able to get one , and even then , they 'd probably give you a card for being retarded . 
  lol, 
  and what is the composition of the parties opposing the bills ? 
  will parliament be able to garner the needed votes for a motion of no confidence * ( who 's threshhold i would imagine is pretty high and not just a simple majority ) * ? 
  will in-fighting between parties for such a monumental decision occur if they opposed it or were ambivalent to it ? 
  and what abut the council and executives of the member-states ? 
  if they did n't agree with it , why would they nominate somebody who * would * agree to it ? 
  and if the european parliament goes against the national governments ... who do you think is going to come out on top at the moment ? 
  i still think it 's a bad set-up . 
  but like i said , that 's just my opinion . 
  ugh ... yeah ... that 's kinda one of the main points i touched upon ... 
  all it takes is one strong commission president and one denial to set a precedent that will fuck you for decades . 
  it 's much better , stability-wise and democratically , for that power to either be solely in the hands of the legislature or at least * shared * with the executive branch . 
  but as i 've said before , this is just my opinion & i might have a bias . 
  though i highly doubt any or at least most of your national legislatures would ever tolerate such a set-up . 
  nah , it was just legalized in colorado & washington completely . 
  though only colorado has got the infrastructure in place to actually sell marijuana in shops * ( washington is still working on it ) * , and the state is making a shit load in profits off it in vice taxes . 
  and other cash-strapped states are taking a keen interest in that new-found revenue . 
  i just hope they do n't get stupid and try to over-tax it , driving it back underground . 
  that would be the most retarded thing ever , given the already huge black market for weed ; it would n't be that hard to sell and smuggle un-taxed shit if they go overboard given the already decades old networks in place * ( and still in place for nearby states since weed 's still not legal there ) * . 
  but hopefully they do n't do that , and play it smart like they did with alcohol & cigarettes * ( although cigarette smuggling has been increasing in response to the excessive vice taxes they 've been tagging on them ... but meh ) * . 
  yeah , i kinda figured i was wrong on that , i knew resources were found , but i did n't know when . 
  but i want to point out to you the [ chaco war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chaco_war ) , one of the most destructive wars in south american history and one which was fought over the gran chaco region which was thought rich with oil . 
  ** two paraguayans and three bolivians died for every square mile of the contested territory . 
  ** it 's believed by many to have been instigated by the royal dutch shell and standard oil companies , while some others attribute it too the aims of argentina to import oil from the chaco through paraguay , though personally i consider it to be a mix of both . 
  but none of that really matters anyway ; [ commercial amounts of oil & gas were n't discovered until ** 2012 ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chaco_war#aftermath ) . 
   so , i guess my point is , while you 're right ... * you never know * ... 
  population do n't mean shit when you got that much territory . 
  alaska only has around 750,000 people and is the fourth-least populated state in the union , yet it 's also the largest state in the union . 
  i think the canadian providences would work just fine as states going off that example . 
  hell , in addition to alaska , wyoming & the dakotas all have populations under a million , yet are pretty god damn big be traditional standards in comparison to the original 13 & european union member-states . 
  though ... now that you mention it ... i would n't mind u.s. states being combined into a smaller number of super-states like in [ the fallout-universe ] ( http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/united_states#the_american_commonwealths ) . 
  in fact , i 'd even prefer it . 
  in which case , i totally agree canada should be annexed as 4-5 states . 
  though i understand your logic for doing it now with the present-amount of states and do understand the benefits , but i do n't think the canadians would go for it if it ever was ever on the table , since it would reduce their influence in the senate and since their populations are so low , even combined , their influence would be nill in the house as well . 
  but 8 different states , with 16 senators ? 
  shit , that would give canada some real leverage in the senate to dictate the national course . 
  in the 2000s referendum ( s ) and the referendums before that , but this is the first time they 've voted , even if only with a * slight * majority , to become a state . 
  it 's pretty exciting actually . 
   i might might live to witness the 51st state . 
  like i said , the one i linked was non-binding , but because of it one is coming up that is constitutionally-authorized and * will be binding * . 
  so hopefully that slight majority comes back and proves they 're real at the voting booth . 
  state rights bruh bruh ... * when it pleases the administration * ... , 
  if they dislike doing * their job * than they should n't of ran for election and agreed to represent their constituency . 
  legislative initiative , in my opinion , is the fundamental right of any legislature and a important ingredient for any healthy government ; it 's critical to the separation of powers and a proper system of checks & balances . 
  at the very least , * it should be shared with the executive branch * . 
  of course , this is just my personal opinion , and being a american , it might be slightly biased . 
  yes , but switzerland relies heavily on direct democracy and local governance , which , in my opinion , would be impossible with the european union given it 's immense size and population . 
  italy & germany * are way more * applicable to the european union , hell , the european union 's government structure is almost a carbon copy of germany 's . 
  and germany today would n't be united if it was n't for bismark . 
  and you 're lying to yourself about the united kingdom , and you know it . 
  despite it 's * `` living constitution '' * , it was the tudors and cromwell , both strong leaders/houses , whether for better or worse , that truly united the united kingdom and gave it direction . 
  the european union ca n't be compared to the united kingdom , it 's much better compared to the early united states . 
  it does n't have a strong unified history , * a strong unified tradition * , like the united kingdom does . 
  it ** needs ** a piece of paper like a the american constitution to artificially subsidize that . 
  yeah ... * but come on * ... . 
  i want to point out the german empire on this . 
  half-cooked methods resulted in it being divided and remaining divided for centuries . 
  sure , it gave a * ` sense of identity ' * , but it was n't 'till bismark came around and laid down a strong precedent , a strong direction , that centuries of half-cooked methods were turned around and solidified in a matter of * years * . 
  the same can be said for italy & giuseppe garibaldi . 
  what the european union needs is a bismark without the wars ; that 's hard to come by , since bismark was damn near a political genius and you do n't have the leverage of war that he had , but still , * it 's what 's needed * . 
  else , in my opinion , the european union will be condemned to what italy & germany experienced for centuries . 
  and if not done properly , you might end up in the position spain is in now with catalonia or your own country is in now with scotland . 
  well yeah that ... or the fact that unlike every member-state 's parliament/legislature , the european parliament lacks legislative initiative . 
  it 's not even shared with the executive branch like in many member-state goverments . 
  that 's what happens when you lack legislative initiative . 
  ** tl ; dr europe has a identity crisis it ca n't solve . 
  europe is trying to do two things at once . 
  so it 's going to only be half as good in both . 
  and if it 's not careful , byspeeding in two completely different directions * ( close federation , loose confederation ) * , it 's gon na tear itself in two . 
  ** every us state * does devolve power * within itself . 
  they 're all unitary states . 
  and no , it would n't really make a difference to me , but i would n't like it , as it would fuck with my ocd which is inexcusable . 
  and the difference between a confederation and a federation has been getting murkier by the day for the european union . 
  i do n't know , the european union is confusing to be honest , and it 's supposed to be . 
  there are a lot of people right now with a lot of emotional views on the topic and all of whom have different ideas of what the european union should be , because to be honest , nobody knows what it is . 
  and that 's the problem . 
  the european union has a identity crisis . 
  and until that 's solved , all of this shit , it 's just shit , because there 's not quantifiable definition of * what exactly * the european union is because none has been reached . 
  wtf does * `` ever , closer union '' * mean anyway ? 
  it 's broad ass language . 
  until european politicians sit down , talk and collectively agree on * what * the european union and * where * the european union is going , all of this is mute . 
  i mean , every country goes through this , but even the american states came around and signed the constitution , and even before that , knew what was what in the articles of confederation ; and state rights disputes still persisted after the signing of the constitution , but the country still had a concrete identity and parameters for it 's direction . 
  the treaties which set-up the european union are half-assed attempts at this , and they got half-assed results . 
  it 's like ... some weird ass half-way-point between the articles & constitution , with everybody too timid or unsure on which one they want to be . 
  such is good for fostering political debate ... but i mean ... you ca n't put that kinda language in your * founding * document . 
  you got to have a strong foundation , and than debate from there . 
  have your articles , debate , than decide on a constitution . 
  not sign a weird mix-of-both and try to figure it out as you go along . 
  oh you 're talking about america doing this ?
