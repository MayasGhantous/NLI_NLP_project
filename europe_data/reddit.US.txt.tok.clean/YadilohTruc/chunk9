  totes dude , totes . 
  i 've been wanting to annex canada ever since fallout man . 
  but fuck that * `` separate union '' * noise , we need a fully integrated nation yo , to shit just * a lil more * on the eu 's dreams . 
  could n't agree with you more on switzerland either . 
  hitler called it a * `` pimple on the face of europe '' * , let 's make the eu look at it the same . 
  that right there is like ... a century of ... what 's that german word again ? 
  yeah , that shit . 
  we need to get on top of that . 
  ** tl ; dr as a outsider , it 's fun to watch their train wreck/road to glory develop into a dream/nightmare . 
  but it is kinda odd how ambivalent and ignorant many europeans seem to be about the eu ... given that it 's going to determine their entire future , no matter which direction it goes , for better or for worse . 
  ** well yeah ... * kinda * ... 
  i think what exactly the european union actually is ... is a question that a lot of people are fighting to figure out right now and something a lot of people have different opinions on ... ... in my personal opinion it 's resulted in a beast that does n't know if it wants to be a loose organization with horizontal integration * ( expansion into eastern europe and the balkans ) * or a highly-integrated federation with vertical integration * ( heavy integration of present-members ; eurozone ) * ... . so it 's trying to do both ... be both a loose union and a tight union ... but i personally think this can end up with it trying to go so fast in two separate directions that it 's going to tear itself in two if the politicians do n't get their shit together and come to a consensus on * what exactly * the eu is and * where exactly * it 's going . 
  you might get disaster in a bureaucratic mangled mess , or you might get the united states of europe . 
  as a outsider though , it 's fun to watch ... feels like i 'm in revolutionary times watching congress transition from the articles of confederation to the constitution . 
  or what might 've happened if they had n't . 
  though it 's odd that europeans ar n't really that emotional about where their nation is heading ... since the eu * will be * the watershed moment , whichever direction it goes ... but maybe many early american citizens felt the same ambivalence to the central government ? 
  you can do what the fuck you want with liberia & switzerland , but canada is apart of my north american union dream-state * ( or better yet , the next 10 american states ) * so you can fuck right off there buddy . 
  :p ** edit : ** and still kinda unsure about liberia given the historical connection we have with it ... so that 's on ice buddy ... but yeah , do want you want with the swiss . 
   the usa will grow by $ 500 ~ ~ million ~ ~ billion over the year ** ftfy **  [ the imf predicts we 'll surpass the eu 's economy in a couple years ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/01/pdf/text.pdf ) . 
  [ eu law has supremacy over national law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_law#supremacy ) . 
  though you 're right , they 're nowhere near as centralized as the united states , nor do they have a unified foreign policy , monetary policy and a concrete fiscal policy . 
  but remember , there were really no federal jails & prisons before the 20th century * ( not counting p.o.w. 
  camps and shit during the civil war ) * , and you only had the u.s. marshalls , and europe does have a slight equivalent with the [ european gendamarie force ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_gendarmerie_force ) . 
  and before the 20th century , the united states relied mainly on militia units provided by states * ( though , unlike european member-states , american states could n't deploy outside the united states ... cause they could n't have a foreign policy outside of the central government ) * . 
  the exception being the civil war , but both before & after it militia-units dominated until the early 20th century . 
  but these can be compared to the eurocorps or [ eu battlegroups ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup ) . 
  you 're right in a essence though , there are ** great differences ** between the united states and european union , but there are still ** great similarities ** between the * early * united states and european union . 
  though a better comparison for the european union would probably be when the united states was under the [ articles of confederation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/articles_of_confederation ) . 
  so what do you call germany ? 
  a federation in a federation ? 
  i mean , even american states are unitary . 
  i feel like xzibit should be a german . 
  ** tl ; dr it 's kinda like the early united states , it kinda is n't . 
  it 's kinda a country , it kinda is n't . 
  it 's member-states are kinda like american states , they 're kinda not . 
  it 's kinda like a federal supranational union , it kinda is n't . 
  it 's kinda like a confederate supranational union , it 's kinda not . 
  ** the european union is actually ** very similar ** to the early united states . 
  except ... you know ... they have a bunch of different languages and histories , which is rather homogeneous in america , but politically they 're quite similar ; with the exception of a unified foreign policy and a actual fiscal/monetary union . 
  militarily they 're quite similar to the united states as well . 
  i mean ... states could n't * legally * act unilaterally outside of america * ( even if they did ) * , but the federal military more-than-not relied mostly on state militias all the way up to the early 20th century * ( we did n't when the civil war started to really get hot , but quickly went back to the old way right after with demobilization ) * . 
  alright ... so fuck ... perhaps they 're more similiar to the united states under the articles of confederation ... or a weird fucking mix between that and early constitutional united states ... but the pieces and resemblance is still there . 
  i mean , even u.s. citizens identified more with their state than their country before the civil war ... a quote i once heard , paraphrased , was * `` before the civil war they addressed the country as ` these united states of america ' and after they addressed is as ` the united states of america ' * , which i always found quite interesting . 
  i mean ... the european union has a lot more local/regional history , a lot more languages and a lot more insulated cultures to hinder any single national identity than the early united states ... but eh ... maybe they can learn to hold it as * equal * to their nationality instead of * superior * to it ... hell ... i 'm pretty sure most americans do this , especially texans ... but fuck ... they do n't really have the advantages we did . 
  even blacks and hispanics could identify with the * `` american dream '' * and * `` american exceptionlism '' * and ideals like that ; i do n't really know what europe has to compare to that for integration . 
  though the eu is a weird beast . 
  unsure if it wants to be a centralized federation or a decentralized confederation ; it has a judicial , legislative & executive branch , yet a parliament without legislative initiative ; eu law has supremacy over national law when it conflicts , but it does n't have a single currency nor a strong fiscal/monetary union ; it strives to represent the whole consortium on the international scene , but it 's members lack a common foreign policy and * will * act independently , militarily as well . 
  eh ... we 'll see how things turn out ... 
  and i 'm telling you that helicoptering our dick is not just a good thing , but beneficial to american citizens . 
  we would be able to see a lot more of that benefit , as every-day americans , if we reformed present legislation . 
  whether sprouting about ideals or simply interjecting asinine comments , waving our cock around * is a good thing * for us . 
  well ... it 's rooted in america ... 
  this is completely wrong in every way imaginable . 
  we have had resource wars in the ancient past , distant past , recent past and present-day . 
  shit ai n't just gon na magically stop for the next 500 years . 
  whoever thinks that is on some hippy-level optimistic bullshit . 
  i do n't know why you 're being down-voted , you 're ** completely right ** . 
  resource wars are like ... as fucking as old as humanity ... ** and happen today ** * ( south sudan & partly iraq ) * . 
  why do ya 'll think the british got the americans to coup the iranians ? 
  what do you think one of the main causes for the war in iraq were * ( even if it was n't the only cause ) * ? 
  our alliance with the saudis ? 
  why do you think the french invaded mali * ( here 's a hint , niger , mali 's neighbor , provides up to a 1/5th of france 's uranium ... which ... you may have guessed it ... ties into nuclear energy being the main provider of energy in france ) * ? 
  why do you think argentina invaded the falklands and china is threatening to invade a bunch of shitty , desolate islands in the south china sea ? 
  have ya 'll not seen the * `` smack-you-in-the-face '' * media coverage about the dependence of europe on russian gas , or until very recently , america 's addiction to foreign oil ? 
  why do ya 'll think inspired european colonialism & exploration ? 
  gold , silver & spices yo . 
  resources . 
  and water 's beginning is going to be a hot issue in the next half-a-century , and you can be damn certain we 'll see some wars fought over that too . 
  yeah , but you know [ a majority of puerto ricans just voted to become the 51st state ] ( http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/01/tiny-step-toward-statehood-puerto-rico/357263/ ) . 
  it was n't binding , but got things going in the right direction , with a official congressional-authorized referendum on the way . 
  i think the guy 's point was that puerto rico is the worst example of european soft power because it 's one of the most prominent examples of american soft power . 
  i really hope not . 
  a world with our country at the lead is a world i feel more comfortable in and a world i feel like which can serve my interests better . 
  one which i think , as a american citizen , i can make more of a difference in . 
  i do n't want china nor the european union to take that from us . 
  though if a multi-polar world does come about , which it eventually will , i want to be in the lead in cooperation with the european union , a partnership that defines us both as * `` first-among-equals '' * in comparison to china , russia , brazil and possibly india & south africa * ( possibly nigeria instead or in addition too ) * as well . 
  a real , solidified * `` western world '' * . 
  we have a lot of legislation to reform at home before we can begin to see more of the benefits that our international position affords us , but fuck me if i want to get rid of the benefits we have now and reform * then * . 
  so yeah , count me out on that line of thought . 
  fuck me if i want to shoot ourselves in the foot , go isolationist and become a little international bitch where our influence is significantly curtailed . 
  got shit fucked up yo , i 'm sorry , i really , really am , but for me america should strive to be either a superpower or at the very least one of the foremost great powers . 
  and unlike the great colonial empires of the past , we 're not going to shrink down to the size oregon with a population slightly larger than california . 
  that 's ... that 's not really racist . 
  i do n't agree at all with what he 's saying , but you 're wrong if you think that 's racism . 
  like ... he was n't even * ( directly , nor do i believe implicitly , since nationality is a different thing altogether ) * talking abut race or ethnicity ... . at all ... 
  yes , but one of the smartest things macarthur did was ** keep ** the japanese emperor around . 
  it gave the people somebody to identify with , a symbol of the state , and since the emperor agreed with and supported the occupation , it helped maintain peace and stability . 
  remember , japan was no stranger to coups before and during the war , fuck , they launched a coup * during the surrender * to prevent it . 
  of course ... even though this came at the cost of letting a war criminal go ... it still helped like a motha ' fucker during the occupation in keeping the peace and re-building japan ... but still do n't know how i feel about letting a war criminal go for the greater good ... but meh ... iraq ... iraq is a whole different ball-park ... and unlike japan , it has the saudis & iranians pumping in fucktons of money every day to fight a proxy war against each other ... 
  the moroccans ? 
  yes , but than why would you include the common security & defense clause in the treaty ? 
  than again ... i guess the same could be said for it 's parliament , commission , council and high courts if it 's only meant to be economic union ... * but still * ... 
  you know what dude . 
  you 're completely right . 
  power projection is completely fucking unnecessary . 
  i apologize . 
  the sliver of land between kalingrad & belarus , and the easily transversible terrain between sweden & denmark are completely appropriate and no way are a disadvantage which you can help alleviate through proper power projection . 
  it 's totally wise to throw all your chips on those two . 
  i never said that we should station defensive forces in the baltics to the point they can deter russia , because you 're completely right , that would be unnecessarily provocative , but i am saying that the eu should develop it 's power projection * so it can get troops there on time * before the baltics * do fall * . 
  power projection is my argument .
