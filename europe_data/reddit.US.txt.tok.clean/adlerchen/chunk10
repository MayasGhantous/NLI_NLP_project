  and the disinformation does not have to be about germany . 
  many kinds of narratives are useful , although the one you see in the image is primarily for their domestic audience . 
  if they 're lucky , it will be reported by the non eu countries in their near abroad . 
  i honestly ca n't say i 'm surprised . 
  i feel german bureaucracy is highly professional , but also very conservative . 
  i do n't think they would announce or admit to a foreign disinformation campaign , unless a thorough investigation found hard evidence . 
  you might be projecting a bit because of what 's happening in michigan right now . 
  the real problem has been the interstate allotment agreements that were hashed out with the feds . 
  the colorado river is important for arizona , nevada , and california , but phoenix and las vegas keep needing more and more . 
  another issue , one that has been hugely politicized beyond the point where reality stops , has been over conservation laws to protect endangered species in the delta . 
  some farmers in the imperial valley would like the water to be diverted and the conservation efforts to be abandoned , but they are n't hurting for water . 
  local aquifers have been sufficient . 
  and especially after we 've been having record rains this winter , the drought looks like it will be declared officially over soon . 
  the irony of your statement is that separatist movements go back the 80s and were once stronger in the rural north than anywhere else , including those who have wanted to split the state over water rights issues . 
  now there 's a growing number of people in the urban areas as well who want this . 
  everytime he threatens to cut federal funding even though we are net payers and everytime he tries to cow our municipal police to do the feds jobs for them , the desire grows stronger . 
  i 've seen lots of us flags taken down and replaced with the state flag here in la. 
  but our career civil servants are crack . 
  that is until they get mass purged for daring to not be yes men . 
  i honestly ca n't do a decent summary of it all . 
  it 's such an expansive topic , and yeah , it does involve speculation . 
  i guess i would start you off with [ this article ] ( https://warontherocks.com/2017/02/the-war-among-the-generals/ ) . 
  there 's two separate foreign polices being advocated for . 
  the mattis and kelly stand for what was the status quo : strong nato , japanese , and south korean ties . 
  you might have heard of mattis going to many of these countries and trying to reassure them of us commitments . 
  [ mattis went to japan ] ( http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/mattis-an-instant-hit-in-japan-and-south-korea ) and reassures them them of our commitments to defend the senkaku islands as we see it as japan 's sovereign territory , but that came after the administration declared them to be [ currency manipulators ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/02/01/business/trump-lambastes-japan-china-currency-devaluation/ ) . 
  the other foreign policy is pushed by flynn and kellogg . 
  they are more hostile to china , are willing to work with russia , and see islam as a civilization that it is at war with the wider west , [ which is why flynn is so gungho on war with iran ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/losangeles/comments/5sb1i6/trump_california_in_many_ways_is_out_of_control/dde3s3n/?context=1 ) . 
  to be blunt , this is the conspiracy theorist faction . 
  it 's probably why [ rumors surfaced that a us aid to flynn was inquiring about polish incursions into belarus . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5s6536/yesterday_poland_was_startled_by_ap_agency/ ) that obviously did n't happen , but it shows that some at the top are getting alternative facts so to speak . 
  there 's so many instances of contradictions , that i could go on forever . 
  i know this is n't much , but it should provide a little reading for you . 
  the government is at war itself right now , and all the leaks and former major officials giving statements against it and its policies speak to it . 
  yeah , but more is better . 
  pls gib guns and money . 
  take everything you hear these days with a grain of salt , especially if it 's claimed it 's coming from us government officials . 
  right now a lot of `` facts '' are being fed into the media , only to be `` corrected '' later . 
  it 's an intentional psyop campaign to make the press look unreliable . 
  the danger is understated by you . 
  american democracy is very robust , but there are liabilities and loopholes by which it can be degraded * slowly * . 
  judge appointments are for life , but attorney generals serve at the behest of the executive . 
  they can be removed as yates was . 
  this stifles if not quashes the investigatory powers the executive has over itself . 
  a combination of control over the careers of such important civil servants and the presidential pardon means that a fundamentally immoral president could slowly begin a program of revenge against dissent with impunity . 
  the next check is congress , and there 's no reason to think they will come together and overcome their partisanship anytime soon . 
  they could launch independent investigations , but they are n't and they likely will not so long as ryan gets to push forward his radical `` reform '' agenda . 
  the judiciary itself is largely independent , but individual judges can be threatened and potentially cowed . 
  the public can help prevent this by standing behind them in every instance , but so far i 'm just seeing appall behind keyboards . 
  not in the streets with arms . 
  it 's in this environment where the attacks on the legitimacy of the press become the most dangerous . 
  there seems to be a concerted effort right now to muddy the waters at every instance in order in inculcate a perception that lies and propaganda are completely pervasive so that it is normalized . 
  this is preparation for future abuses whereby a large portion of the public will not know what to believe and will start dismissing scandals . 
  really this started during the election , but right now it 's reached a whole new level . 
  the white house press secretary spicer is giving lies of omissions and even blatant lies , so that the press reports it , but others associated with the presidential cabal or supporters in the public can correct them later in order to erode trust in the press . 
  by design , many segments of the press have been shut out of the communication process with white house officials in order to keep their ability fact check anything as low as possible . 
  the first and second lines of democracy are the free press and the judiciary , but both are under attack and the legitimacy is intentionally being undermined . 
  it will take some time before * serious * infringements on individuals liberties can start to appear . 
  however , the people , if they can be lead to become too cynical , can be mislead into allowing and accepting future abuses . 
  authoritarian creep did n't start now . 
  it showed its head in the bush years , but right now its scope is increasing in an unbelievable way . 
  it 's the concessions on issues that pop up from time to time , all of it slowly chipping away at a moral society . 
  a future america might in some time see murders of journalists with botched or dismissed investigations . 
  if you asked if people want that , they will say no of course , but if they are complacent we can wind up at that place all the same . 
  the institutions that can prevent and deter it are threatened all the same . 
  in order to reach a future where abuses of power can accumulate slowly , they are actually seemingly very intelligently targeting the legitimacy of the free press and judiciary . 
  [ this article ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/03/how-to-build-an-autocracy/513872/ ) explains the dilemmas better than i ever could . 
  none of these were covered up . 
  they were all covered in the news , some more prominently than others . 
  this was possible because the press remains free . 
  governments have not yet issued gag orders on them to not cover any stories . 
  you 're creating a strawman . 
  no one is forgiving any terrorist attacks . 
  nor is anyone forgetting them , except of course the president of the unites states , who does not acknowledge that some coverage of some of the attacks even earned some journalists prizes in journalism , and yet rants utterly delusionally that there is a cover up . 
  so you go for the 4d parcheesi interpretation ? 
  i do n't . 
  i think this is a deliberate attempt to muddy the waters and delegitimize the press . 
  i 'm not even sure the * current * ban is even a end goal in itself , but rather a means to an all together different end . 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqkzestq0wo ), 
  now includes 60 % more warsaw !, 
  ^ ^ restrictions ^ ^ may ^ ^ apply, 
  in the modern parlance , it 's now `` swamp germans '' . 
  brexit has gone too far . 
  german engineering has made them obsolete the bridge is a go !, 
  i swear , 98 % of them do n't even know she 's been the head of a religiously christian and conservative party . 
  only the europeans there would know that , and the rest clearly are n't looking this shit up before talking about `` leftist '' germany and the refugees ... 
  we did it reddit, 
  [ uh , that exists . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b53x9gzscuy ) and yes some people make a stink of it . 
  there 's advertisements in hundreds of languages all across the us . 
  it just depends where you are . 
  yeah , but they 're still going to enter the bundestag at at least 10 % of the mps minimum . 
  that will provide an amazing platform for stunts that can be propagandized for the next election . 
  he 's always had them . 
  why do you think he 's still there , and why you think relations had soured after 2014 ? 
  and if lukashenko resigns , that means no closer ties to the eu . 
  it 's called fabricating a casus belli via narrative setting . 
  russia can say that russians are in danger in belarus , and you know what that means . 
  that was no offer . 
  it was a threat .
