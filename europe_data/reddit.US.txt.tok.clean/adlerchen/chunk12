  this sub is about europe . 
  politics just gets posted here * a lot * these days . 
  i 'm not a mod , buuuuuut , feel free to post some travel pics or start up a conversation with a text post thread . 
  averages across tens of millions of people does n't give anyone a clear picture , man . 
  think of all the outliers from the very rich to the very poor . 
  plus there is the issue of pre selection by not including those who have no income , aka the very , very , very poor . 
  obviously there are totally normal non brigading users over on r/the _ donald . 
  i know this . 
  i even sometime peruse the subreddit . 
  but there is brigading going on . 
  you can look at any major subreddit about a place , or about politics , and see what i 'm talking about . 
  i 'm not pointing specific fingers at anyone , not even at the subreddit . 
  but it is happening , and i 'd assume you know this too . 
  there is a reason i was talking about a offsite effort to organize it . 
  lets be real people here . 
  ideologues do n't help anyone or anything , not least themselves , and that 's why this situation is just sad . 
  i do n't know why they think they 're helping . 
  they 're just pissing people off and giving normal supporters * a really bad name * . 
  ps : great memes by the way . 
   obama couldnt be criticized because he was black . 
  i think you may have been living under a rock . 
  that man was under extreme scrutiny . 
  hell , `` obamacare '' was the fabricated name to tie him directly to the aca that congress wrote and passed . 
  `` obama has ruined race relations in america '' . 
  `` obama is a secret kenyan muslim who wants to destroy america '' . 
  `` obama is ruling by executive order '' . 
  all this and more was said a lot . 
   trump is a breath of fresh air . 
  in it for the better future of our nation , our nation is not being bettered by threatening to invade mexico and half assing military ops in yemen . 
  except i did n't . 
  i am a pretty suave dude though . 
  do we include the civilians , children , and ones own enlisted men in the botched raid in yemen ? 
  i feel like criminal maleficence should count here . 
  there 's no excuse when you 've removed the director of national intelligence and the joint chiefs of staff from the national security council and then proceed to okay an operation that your predecessor passed up on due to lack of intel ... 
  nothing 's happened to me ever , but one hears the horror stories . 
  you know , there 's jackasses and idiots everywhere in the world , and sometimes they think it 's a good idea to take politics out on individuals when they are guests in their country . 
  i 'm not going to make assumptions . 
  i just ca n't believe people became so polarized . 
  it 's really sad . 
  yeah , but you have to know what i 'm talking about . 
  numerous young accounts saying exactly the same `` correction '' to a recent scandal . 
  i think they 're a different group than the shit stirrers and trolls , but who even knows . 
  seriously what websites are they using to organize this shit ?? 
  is it deep web ? 
  they 're everywhere on any reddit thread that gets even close to a 1000 upvotes on a political topic within like an hour . 
  we 'd loan it out , but we know that your museums play for keeps . 
  go back to your cheeto benito  the cool kids are calling him twittler now , i think . 
  i swear , it 's all british media outlets . 
  not a single one seems above this shit . 
   at least trump does what he said he would do , terrifying as that is . 
  it 's basically a bad luck brian moment , really . 
  this is like one of the few times since the 1870s that any president has actually taken all of his platform seriously . 
  and look at all shit he said , and people 's jaws are on the fucking floor right now including [ a noticeable chunk of his own voters . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/trumpgret/top/ ) it 's would be funny if was n't happening here . 
  i hear they 're making back door lobbying easier . 
  get it on as a rider for a bill . 
  shhhhhh . 
  * eurobonds * , remember ? 
  they 'd need a small loan of a million euros first . 
  meh , i 'll take it . 
  big e is back , baby !, 
  it 's like a ouroboros . 
  both sides keep eating themselves as they polarize . 
  they 've been preserved in a brine of greek tears though . 
  say outrageous shit = less loans for the campaign . 
  or like survivor , we can call the immunity idol the `` permanent security council seat '' . 
  and i do n't have any sympathy either , although now we all have to suffer for her hubris . 
  [ and sanders was fucking right all along . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/republican/comments/5qe49a/texas_gop_rep_blasts_wall_as_expensive_ineffective/dcyqt7b/?context=3 ) [ also very relevent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glg9g7bcjks ), 
  i actually never heard that before , but that 's perfect . 
  it 's part of the poem , a part i did n't quote . 
  here 's the full text :  not like the brazen giant of greek fame ,  with conquering limbs astride from land to land ;  here at our sea-washed , sunset gates shall stand  a mighty woman with a torch , whose flame  is the imprisoned lightning , and her name  mother of exiles . 
  from her beacon-hand  glows world-wide welcome ; her mild eyes command  the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame . 
   `` keep , ancient lands , your storied pomp ! '', 
  cries she  with silent lips . 
  `` give me your tired , your poor ,  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ,  the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . 
   send these , the homeless , tempest-tost to me ,  i lift my lamp beside the golden door ! '', 
  then you have n't been paying attention over the years . 
  they do this sometimes . 
  quite often for news about my country actually . 
  yeah , but it 's an amphibious assault ship . 
  [ back in the day , they probably would have classed it as a lowly cve . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/uss_coral_sea_%28cv-43%29_and_wasp_%28lhd-1%29_underway_in_1989.jpeg ), 
  it 's not their fault the media has gone to shit . 
  they have n't been the ones calling themselves the `` new leader of the free world '' . 
   that 's us !, 
  no , no . 
  that became ^ ^ ^ most ^ ^ ^ of us . 
  :p  i decided a while back that if i 'm ever an admiral or president i 'm going to name an aircraft carrier mother of exiles . 
  please do . 
  deifying the presidents is creepy . 
  we need more wasps , enterprises , and lexingtons again . 
  he did n't say anything against liberal values , my friend . 
  frankly i expected the new colossus in bold print , but the torch of liberty being extinguished works as well . 
   `` give me your tired , your poor ,  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ,  the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . 
   send these , the homeless , tempest-tost to me ,  i lift my lamp beside the golden door ! '', 
  yeah that 's a thing , and der spiegel was always inordinately harsh on the us , but in this case it 's actually deserved for once imo . 
  is a great band name . 
  it might be construed as a good sign [ when the military starts shitposting assassination memes three days into the job .
