  but if just ask for just `` water '' they try and pawn off some bottled tap water and charge you for it . 
  this was also a culture shock for me when i visited lots of places in europe . 
  this a million times . 
  hell , * i do n't even fully understand how it functions * and i actually pay attention and try . 
  what they should really be doing is mandating that water is free in restaurants . 
  it 's silly to have to pay for it when everyone 's taxes already take care of it , and allow the restaurants to have tap on demand . 
  they still putting the cocaine into the drink where you live ? 
  asking for a friend . 
  `` why are they upset about all the taxes we demand of them for defending them from the french ? '', 
   i think you have a rosy view of early decentralized america , like i used to . 
  i 'm curious how this would be a subject of interest for you at all . 
  it sounds like you 've spent some time reading up and thinking on this stuff . 
   the reason the confederacy got beaten during the war is because the confederate states kept the old way of `` state militias '' doing their own thing , while the north had a united command . 
  well that and a 2:1 manpower disadvantage , a severe materiel disadvantage , naval blockades , and political isolation internationally . 
  these are multinationals . 
  boycotting them because of one of the countries they do business in , seems somewhat inherently ineffective to me . 
  i do n't think it will send a clear enough message . 
  neither fillon or le pen will expand the sanctions , and without france i do n't see it happening ... 
  i do n't like making predictions for the future , but i feel comfortable pointing out that the stars are aligning for some new options for russia this year ... 
  it 's worth mentioning that for the mindset of russian strategic planners these are actually small distances to push . 
  the russian military is divided into large [ military districts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_districts_of_russia ) partly because their generalship is used to thinking at this scale due to the size of the country . 
  the benefits include more orthodox russians to fend off future demographic transition and collapse and pushing the border closer to a natural barrier with the dnieper and getting closer to ensuring a land route to crimea to ensure supply of the black sea fleet . 
  relative to us imports , yeah , us exports are quite low across the board . 
  in any case , [ us exports into the eu accounted for ~ 11 % of the total in 2013 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a1/main_trading_partners%27_shares_of_eu28_imports%2c_2008-2013.png ) , which is a small portion of a small pie , considering how intra eu domestic consumption is so well taken care of by intra eu production . 
  i 'd disagree that that 's their main goal . 
  it 'd be a nice cherry on top , but i do n't think they 're scrambling for it . 
  i think the russian government values security over money right now , and they wo n't miss a beat to move the border westward if they think they can . 
  you should be looking at pubmed rather than fucking wikipedia ... it would do you good to read [ something more like this ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/nbk154484/ ) . 
  we have the best oncologists in the world . 
  good luck affording them ... 
   and if they have preconditions , they might not find a health insurer willing to cover them . 
  well , at least for now , that part is no longer true ... 
  you 'll have to explain it to me in a bit more detail then . 
  i 've lived in europe before . 
  i saw very , very little that was american . 
  what , are you saying sochi wo n't be the new odessa of the black sea ?? 
  ryan , mcconnell , mccain , graham , romney , and cruz all have had very public recent spats with the man . 
  these are not small names , and they are likely the public face for a much larger discontent over a party outsider and foax conservative . 
  even bush was telling people to vote for clinton back in the election ... those wagons , they ai n't circling ... 
   i wish nothing but the best for people in the us and europe both , but with an unhinged , unstable narcissist at the helm it 's sometimes difficult to see how things can work out well for everyone . 
  ai n't that the truth . 
  he seems to see everything as zero sum and does n't seem to have a concept of intangible benefits for things ... 
  how much money have you lost to reddit and facebook ? 
  if you had n't noticed , the republican party is at war with itself these days , and it 's not like federal and state politics have ever been that closely connected to one another . 
  the republican party has a lot of power right now , but no consensus on what to do with it , and maybe even no plan either . 
  trump has no `` mandate '' . 
  he lost the popular vote . 
  maybe the down ballet members of his party do , but he sure as hell does n't . 
  and to top it all off , the supreme court is a independent and apolitical institution so no party has it , and the republicans do not have `` almost all '' local legislatures , only a majority . 
  you vastly overstate and overestimate the situation by a country mile . 
   well since torture is back on the menu ... [ the story is n't over on that . 
  ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/john-mccain-trump-torture/ ) mccain is hardly alone on that stance in congress either . 
  and for that matter , mattis is strictly against it as well . 
  \\  do n't ** buy ** american things \\  no more reddit , no more facebook, 
  state contracts left and right for the donetsk and/or luhangsk oblasts would be a pretty easy way to shore up some oligarch support though ... 
  should n't be hard . 
  us exports to europe are extremely low already ... 
  this is n't surprising . 
  [ conflict between it tech leaders and the white house was predicted by a good number of analysts well in advance . 
  ] ( http://www.eurasiagroup.net/live-post/risk-7-the-white-house-vs-silicon-valley ), 
  they do n't have all the political power right now , and something like this requires unanimous consent . 
  france is almost certainly getting fillon or le pen . 
  neither of them will be on board for expanded sanctions . 
  it 's more likely that us-russia detente will be a useful propaganda tool for more eu federalization though . 
  if it comes down to it , their duma will deficit spend to make sure it will not be a bad year though . 
  russia is no stranger to state financed companies . 
  that seems unlikely . 
  not impossible , but a bit hard to swallow . 
  there was already a huge amount of resistance against the eu sanctions , with italy as a notable example where it was very hard to get them to agree to them and maintain them . 
   cia shooting down mh17 and all that . 
  oh , that 's a new one . 
  last i heard , it was evil right sector azov battalion . 
  rebellion can be fabricated in other places though , in order to keep ukraine out of the eu and nato . 
  with the russian elections coming in 2018 , do n't think that another chuck out of ukraine is completely impossible , especially if it gives putin a chance to `` fix the destroyed cities for the great russian nation '' . 
  or unless russia pushes a lot harder and expands the zones of control of the dpr and lpr . 
   i find it odd that the uk values the us more than europe . 
  our relationship goes back a lot longer . 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  i think you can easily speak of a kind of `` cultural capital '' in this instance . 
   in the eu , it was an equal and important member . 
  is this even true ? 
  i thought that one of the biggest differences in opinion between the uk and most of the rest of the eu is over the opt outs ? 
   the us-uk relationship will never be equal . 
  i 'd agree with this . 
  germany is n't the only country that 's `` too big for europe , too small for the world '' . 
   the uk should never have been a part of the eu . 
  this is a bad way to look at it . 
  if the true goal of the european coal and steel community really was to prevent wars in europe as is often said , then it is self defeating to have members leave it and to have so much resistance for them entering it . 
  what is the purpose of an eu that leaves out the largest countries in europe and thinks that it 's going in the right direction ? 
  and some people wonder why we voted in a protectionist . 
  peace is a respectable goal worthy of being pursued , but unilateral disarmament is naive and likely ensures war . 
  i agree on all points , but it 's even worse than that . 
  israel 's image had already been severely tarnished in the eyes of many american jews because of its far right government . 
  [ 70 % of american jews are democrats or lean toward the democratic party , while only 22 % are republicans or lean republican ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/ ) . 
  when israel snubbed obama and flagrantly abandoned the two state peace process , * and * seemingly willingly allies itself onto [ the side of the american neonazis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6-bi3jlxk ) because of some delusional affinity for the global right , what little love that is left is put in serious danger . 
  ultimately this depends on the country and what their nuclear doctrine is . 
  i 'm just speaking to possible war time policies . 
  some countries undoubtedly will have lower thresholds for mad than others ( if a country with 4 ssbns loses 2 from normal asw , do they jump the shark with a use it or lose it mentality ? 
  i edited in some extra commentary on stuff while you were doing the same with your above comment . 
  :p you should take a look at it as well , since i feel it is relevant to what you are saying now .
