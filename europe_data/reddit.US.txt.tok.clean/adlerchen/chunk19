  not in the spring . 
  otherwise it 's very rare . 
  here in la it 's been raining almost non stop for weeks . 
  very unusual for the wintertime . 
  the european constitution was rejected by the french and the dutch the last time , and i do n't think eu has grown any more popular since then ... 
  is this going to be the new `` third rome '' for the west ? 
  hundreds of years from now , people will be claiming that their own liberal democracy is clearly the legitimate successor of america 's ? 
  some people were calling us the `` universal civilization '' in the 90s for a reason . 
  \\* cough * * war on terror * \\* cough *, 
  so humid , so many old people ... 
  i 'm not personally convinced in the claims and assertions that free markets and free trade are always good . 
  i think that a degree of market interventionism and protectionism can be very warranted in many situations . 
  well , i actually thought it was mostly a decent speech . 
  going for a spousal visa eh ? 
  small contingents who are there as political insurance that their home countries ca n't weasel out of defending the smaller states on the periphery , since there would have already been fighting between them and an advisory . 
  their job is not to defend the country they 're in , it 's to die so full on war ca n't be circumvented through some legal or diplomatic trick . 
  forces like these have been requested from the baltic states for years as an assurance that they wo n't be abandoned . 
  air transport is not cheaper . 
  not in the least . 
  you ca n't move the same kind of volume of goods and you have to expend much larger amounts of fuel per unit of mass per unit of distance than with water based transportation . 
  you get perpetual buoyancy so you only have to use up energy to go forward , instead of for both lift and thrust . 
  as an american , i sympathize very much with that ... 
  it 'll be the `` anti fashionista protective wall '', 
  i do n't agree with the notion that we ceded any influence over to russia in syria . 
  what 's unfolding now is almost a return to the status quo ante bellum . 
  the russians will keep their naval base in tartus , and iran 's proxy group hezbollah will continue to have tacit support from syria , and israel has maintained the perception that it will and can unilaterally intervene in neighbors that are hostile to it . 
  and i also find the narrative that we are in a race for influence to be extremely dangerous . 
  it 's partly true , but it 's also used by neocons like clinton to ramp up us commitments abroad , not just to entrench ourselves where we already have understandings . 
  the truth is is that we 've played an aggressive role in syria , and we 're lucky we had obama and not clinton as president , because he seemed to at least moderate her \\* ahem * recommendations ... 
  she was still proposing a pretty serious escalation in syria . 
  you can see why anyone would be concerned over it , not least because it 's a silly hill die on . 
  i live in la. 
  you ca n't accuse the people here of being trump sycophants , but the only campaign demonstration i ever saw was a anti war one * for trump * . 
  i think it really speaks to the degree of fatigue and disgust over our foreign wars and interventions . 
  [ the pants that this child is wearing are called k\u0101id\u0101ngk\u00f9 in mandarin . 
  ] ( http://www.travelbugjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/split_pants_0.jpg ) this is what it looks like when hundreds of millions of rural poor move into cities all at once . 
  they treat it like a big village . 
  the elections in france , the netherlands , and germany will also play a role i think . 
  parties and candidates will probably take positions on this stuff once the actual negotiations start , and it might pressure the incumbent parties and individuals one way or the other . 
  china very much has ethnocentric nationalism . 
  what do you think the kmt were ? 
  and none of that really disappeared under the prc . 
  mao 's minority policies never really translated into a change in the national conscienceless . 
  han chauvinism is under woven into the thinking of a lot chinese , especially with a sense of innate cultural superiority . 
  this is certainly much , much less the case with those of the middle and upper classes in the first and second tier cities , but it 's still a long standing cultural facet of their society . 
  you might get a little bit of an idea of what i 'm talking about if you read [ joniak-luthi 2015 - the han : china 's diverse majority ] ( https://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/jonfra.html ) . 
  she did a interview on the book [ here ] ( http://newbooksnetwork.com/agnieszka-joniak-luthi-the-han-chinas-diverse-majority-u-of-washington-press-2015/ ) too but it 's obviously not as informative or detailed . 
  especially when it gets completely out of control and forces the government 's hand from time to time , like with the taiwanese protesters on the senkaku/diaoyu islands that spun into riots in mainland china which spun into china moving their navy into japanese waters and their airforce moving into japanese airspace and locking onto a japanese fighter ... 
  there are a lot of bitter expats on the sub . 
  i think venting keeps them a little saner . 
  all of that is true , but i speaking to the mentality of the average person in europe here as much as to policy makers . 
  i think the perception of china in europe is n't informed enough yet by the great power games they 've been playing since hu jintao . 
  but maybe i 'm wrong . 
  you need to spend more time on / r/china then . 
  a lot of the criticism is well founded imo , but some users cross the line of realistic cynicism over to seemingly irrational hatred from time to time . 
  the failure to connect the two in people 's mind is concerning . 
  they cooperate a lot , increasingly on a geopolitical scale . 
  loans and investment from china are part of what is enabling russia to ignore the eu sanctions and continue on a belligerent path in europe . 
  at a certain point , europeans are going to have to realize that they 're not just some distant export machine . 
  they 're playing a political role in europe already . 
  you might be seriously underestimating how seriously important economic growth is to the stability of the ccp and the general society . 
  it 's pretty much the main pillar on which the ccp legitimacy rests . 
  my maternal side of the family are austrian jews . 
  some of them came over to the us in the late 19th century from austria-hungary . 
  they were somewhat educated and just wanted a better life . 
  my grandma has pictures of some of those that stayed in austria , including two young women who became doctors . 
  she told me that they were denied into the us as refugees even though they had family here . 
  we do n't know which camps they were sent too , just that we completely lost touch in 1940 ... 40 people gone just like that ... :(, 
  they 're still developing their blue water navy capabilities , both in terms of modernizing the people 's liberation army navy but also in establishing a chain of naval bases all around indian ocean and the south china sea , such as in sri lanka and malaysia . 
  it would be silly to hand wave this all , especially in the light of the state promoted militancy and nationalism in the country . 
  you have it backwards . 
  the us is far less reliant on trade than china is . 
  they do n't have the same kind of steady domestic consumption , and as a net exporter , ca n't afford to have exports drop or commodity imports be threatened , or else the state run companies might require more funding from the government . 
  china treats this all as first and foremost a jobs creation program for social stability , and as a power transfer system for party insiders . 
  the last thing the ccp wants is their biggest trade partner to go protectionist on them . 
  the next leadership swap is this year , and xi ca n't afford to look weak or incompetent in the face of external problems if he wants to remain as the paramount leader , so neither does him . 
  in any case , this is all from planning from years ago . 
  the [ one belt , one road ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one_belt,_one_road ) initiative was announced in 2013 and specific details of it were in motion before that . 
  the train line is n't in response to trump . 
  this train line is partly a prestige project , and partly insurance in case a naval blockade is ever successfully implemented against them . 
  the opening moves of obama 's pivot to asia strategy made it a open secret that the us plan in case of conflict with china was to set up a naval blockade . 
  that 's why marines were moved to northern australia and naval assets where moved to singapore . 
  this time they 're bringing the drugs in the form of `` china white '' ( fentanyl ) and `` flakka '' ( \u03b1-pyrrolidinopentiophenone ) . 
  and now we need one for the remain sides .

  i still ca n't believe that someone originally against brexit was put as the pm of the uk . 
  you would think she would know not to oversell it , that is unless she has n't already resigned herself to be the fall guy for what happens .
