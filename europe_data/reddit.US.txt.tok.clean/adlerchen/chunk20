  that 's because people from the low countries are already disproportionately sized !, 
   it would be ironic if it fell to the chinese to be the defender the `` free world . '' china is happy to sell themselves as the defender of free trade ( just ignore the difficulty in operating in their markets laowais ) , but they 're never going to promote civil liberties .

  he says it needs to be changed to serve american interests and that it does n't address modern problems properly . 
  i do n't know if i would describe his sentiments as dislike , but perhaps rather that of skepticism in its worth . 
  he implied that it would be better refocused as a anti terrorism organization . 
  and he did n't say to spend more money * on * nato , but that nato members should be spending the minimum 2 % of gdp on their own militaries . 
  it 's mainly been the conscription and the military professionalism .

  [ article 49 . 
  ( c ) \u00a7 7 of the treaty of lisbon  ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=oj:c:2007:306:full&amp;from=en )  if a member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory , the other member states shall have towards it an obligation of ** aid and assistance by all the means in their power ** , in accordance with article 51 of the united nations charter . 
  ** this shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states . 
  ** in other words , if you want to stay neutral , just send humanitarian aid . 
  finland , austria , and ireland would never sign off on anything that does n't let them maintain neutrality . 
  collective responsibility \u2260 individual responsibility . 
  : i am an american , i have no individual responsibility for the indian wars . 
  i 've never killed anyone , nor did my ancestors even take part in them . 
  they arrived after they were done . 
  but i share a collective responsibility , because my country wronged others , and as a part of trying to make that better we provide lots of special services for the indigenous communities via taxes . 
  ww2 is still in living memory . 
  the branch of my family that stayed in europe were all murdered by the germans . 
  it would be a shame if germany as a country shirked any collective responsibility it has over the events , and i think it would make the country lose an important part of its modern culture that is good and worth holding onto . 
  just to put a number on it , in 2005 only 8 % of published papers were in a language other than english .

  romney 's response is worth hearing , [ so here 's what followed that part of the debate .

  sour dough is delicious . 
  how bad could a soup with it possibly be ? 
  the correct answer is actually mackerel nigiri . 
  the best italian dish i ever had was cuttlefish in squid ink . 
  obama has not disengaged the us whatsoever . 
  he never had us withdraw from iraq and afghanistan like he campaigned on , he added pakistan , yemen , and somalia to the drone assassination program , he helped britain and france depose the government of libya , and he gave weapons to anti government groups in syria . 
  a lot of the left in the us has joked that he 's the third and fourth terms of george bush for these reasons . 
  it 's literally : `` whose bread i eat , their song i sing . '', 
  or the jailing of political dissenters , no international observers , votes coming from individuals without a passport or other identification from the country that they are seceding from , and to top it all off no choice on the referendum for the status quo . 
  or representative democracy ... 
  the decision makers can be held accountable if they make bad decisions , but the decision making process is less susceptible to propaganda . 
   well , there is n't much she could do against it . 
  what do you expect her to do ? 
  sanction the us ? 
  well obviously she could have put a stop to it . 
  the bnd is under her purview , right ? 
  all of this misses that she and her government did n't want to stop it . 
  rather , they very much did want to collaborate with the nsa in order to keep an eye on possible domestic terrorists . 
  all of the major western governments are handing over data to each other in order to get around national privacy laws . 
  they 're using tip offs and leads from the foreign agencies as a loop hole so they can be compliant with the local laws . 
  that does n't prove the assertion . 
  that 's only total papers overall , which is n't the same as a measure or proxy for quality or impact . 
  it 's conceivable of course , that many english language papers that are published in russian journals are not cited for other reasons . 
  in my field of linguistics , i see papers from russian institutions and individuals that are both in english and russian , but primarily in english , and many of them do not provide significant insights that would be worth discussing in any later papers . 
  if anything , i really think this all speaks to the degree of brain drain in the country . 
  most papers and monographs of note that are originally published in a non english language , will quickly get translated by a specialist press . 
  for a quick example off the top of my head , [ m\u00fcller 2010 - grammatiktheorie ] ( https://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/~stefan/pub/grammatiktheorie.html ) got republished and revised as [ m\u00fcller 2016 - grammatical theory : from transformational grammar to constraint-based approaches ] ( http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/25 ) . 
  now granted that 's a introduction to a topic as much as a theoretical dissertation , but i see this all the time . 
  many unpublished drafts stay this way until the final print in english is prepared . 
  i do n't think that there is much notable work that is n't in english or going to be in a short period , and as a result i do n't necessarily think that a lot of citations are not happening as a result of a language barrier . 
  perhaps this is n't the case in history where there are a lot of primary source document citations , but it 's certainly the case for the sciences , i think . 
  i wonder when witold waszczykowski will have some meetings with their officials . 
   several cities have at one point been named after communist leaders , such as leningrad and stalingrad , but have since gotten back their old ( or some new ? ), 
  names . 
  yep . 
  leningrad 's name got reverted to sankt petersburg , which was the older name , while stalingrad got renamed to volgagrad , which is a new name . 
  the pre communism name for it was tsaritsyn . 
  donetsk in ukraine is another example . 
  it 's communist era name was stalino . 
  here in the us , you can get borscht in a lot of jewish delis , but it 's almost always polish style borscht except without the uszka . 
  i like ukrainian style borscht the best , personally .

  ever since the partido junto popular came to power , the country has gone to shit . 
  they keep trying to distract the people from their problems by promoting militant nationalism . 
  it 's a bit late to be thinking about what future administrations will look like without whistle blowers to keep them accountable , obama ... 
  no we would n't . 
  our government ca n't ban religious practices . 
  it would take a constitutional amendment to add an exception , and it would never happen .

  `` fear is the path to the dark side .

  at ~ 1.6 per woman , russia is actually facing a medium to slow decline much like the uk , france , and sweden . 
  they 'll have a number of cohorts that are particularly small given the more serious collapse in the birth rate in the 90s , and it will be a noticeable problem , but it will smooth over a little bit after a decade , like say in the 2030s . 
  at ~ 1.3 germany , italy , poland , and spain are actually in far worse shape . 
  germany might be a bit less screwed if they can continue to attract large numbers of immigrants and assimilate them . 
  the first part is happening , the latter is more difficult and the jury is still out .
