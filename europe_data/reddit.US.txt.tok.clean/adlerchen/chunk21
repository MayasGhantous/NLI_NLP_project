  here in the us , conscription is done in order of birth year . 
  first the 20 year olds , than the 19 year olds , than the 21 year olds , than the 18 years olds , then the 22 year olds , than it just goes up from there until whenever the cut off date is . 
  or at least that 's what i remember being told when i had to register when i turned 18 . :p, 
  no one on reddit is very representative . 
  this has long been known . 
  preach brother . 
  the ceremony starts this friday the 20th at 9:30 gmt-5 , opening comments at 11:30 gmt-5 , and getting sworn in with supreme court chief justice roberts presiding at ~ 12:00 gmt-5 . 
  for central european time just add 6 hours . 
  they really do n't actually . 
  they only have a real qualitative and quantitative advantage in their surface fleet . 
  their air and land arms are missing lots of capabilities and are behind in modernizing . 
  they also lack numbers in both . 
  while their population advantage is enormous , it would take a lot of time for this to bare out given the relative paucity of existing stockpiles . 
  i think europe could win , but i think it would suffer enormously higher losses . 
  in the past , the europeans were actually well armed and motivated to prosecute wars . 
  neither of those is true anymore . 
  you forgot to mention the oblast of novorossiya and the federal city of odessa . 
  [ and we could n't trust most of nato before he was even elected . 
  ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/06/russia-ukraine-report-46.png ) we 're one of the only 5 members who fulfilling the 2 % of gdp target , and we 're one of the only major members that has majority support for defending the others . 
  this has been nothing but a scam for us . 
  to be fought to the last american ... 
  when every nato member fulfills the wales summit agreement than it can be talked about as any kind of `` bulwark '' . 
  until then , it 's only a liability . 
  `` bitch on the cock , give me vodka , blah ! '', 
  how am i doing ? 
  [ you 're probably wrong unless sentiments have * massively * shifted in one year . 
  ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/06/russia-ukraine-report-46.png ), 
  it 's only the us arsenal which truly amounts to guaranteed destruction . 
  neither france nor the uk have a full nuclear triad , and beyond that , their warhead stockpiles are significantly smaller . 
  [ here ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2015/january/tradoc_152998.1%20trade%20in%20goods%20and%20customs%20tariffs.pdf ), 
  [ trump shows a surprising willingness to allow foreign powers to seize american equipment . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/810288321880555520?lang=en ) i would n't be so sure that much will happen over camp bondsteel . 
  the serbs would likely ignore it , and if they did n't trump might hand wave it away . 
  what 's rose oil used for ? 
  i disagree that nations do n't have friends . 
  many objectively irrational decisions have been made in the past over preferences that derived from cultural causes . 
  just look at [ how germany prioritized austria-hungary over russia which lead to the entente ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reinsurance_treaty ) . 
  that quote was made in a certain global milieu with the backdrop of extreme realpolitik and imperialism . 
  i do n't take it to be some kind of universal truth as a result . 
  the unipolar world order is over though . 
  there is no way to prevent the coming multipolar world . 
  it was inevitable . 
  we 'll all see what the emerging regional powers do once their backyards are theirs again . 
  china and russia seem to have some serious revanchist and imperialist goals so it is n't encouraging , and i hope that does n't set the tone for the coming decades . 
  and you do n't have to worry about us . 
  north america is a fortress . 
  it 's you guys that i 'm worried about . 
  we 're not enemies . 
  our relationship will survive the next four years . 
  just remember that * no one * voted * for * anti eu rhetoric or policies . 
  they voted over health care costs , industrial jobs , and immigration . 
  who was a political appointee , who was just snubbed by being recalled earlier than precedent dictates ... 
  we do n't vote over foreign policy . 
  we vote over domestic issues , and the foreign policy is always a side effect of that . 
  yes . 
  a country can declare them persona non grata . 
  it 's basically unheard of though . 
  this is the race to the bottom . 
  the people of the third world stay poor , and the people of the first world end up on welfare until it runs out . 
  it 's only the rich that are getting richer . 
  look at the global income inequality indexes . 
  that would be nice . 
  they are n't now . 
  the eu imposes a 10 % tariff on imported american cars , while the us imposes only a 2.5 % tariff on imported eu cars . 
  tariff on building them in mexico for * hugely * substandard wages to export them to the us : 0 % t-thanks nafta, 
  normal journalism is n't coming back . 
  the money is in ads , and you get the clicks with outrageous titles , while the subject matter is hollow because no one facts checks and does week long investigations of subjects because they 've got a news cycle to establish so they can get as many stories out as possible . 
  it used to be that in print journalism , a quantity of stories was costly because of space issues . 
  now the goal is make as many articles as possible , as quick as possible , and as scandalous as possible to get those shares on social media . 
  i feel bbc was shit tier reporting since more than just a few years ago . 
  if you want news that does n't seek out the salacious , then you should be reading the [ christian science monitor ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/ ) . 
  they did n't win 7 pulitzer prizes for journalism for no reason . 
  it was a joke about the brits then turning around and wanting out of our union . 
  i guess it might have gone over some heads . 
   it 's that germans always do everything right or better . 
  that ai n't no fact of life . 
  why do you think the cheating devices and software were developed by vw ? 
  it 's so they could cut r&d on their modals and still manage to pass the safety tests done by the regulatory bodies . 
  also volvo is swedish , so why are you bringing them up ? 
  this is specific to the pearl river delta , but nox were found to be likely involved in some estimated 2119 respiratory deaths and 991 lung cancer deaths in 2011 . 
  diesel vehicles are believed to be a significant source of the pollutant in this situation , in addition to marine emissions and industrial point sources . 
  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0269749116300562 the findings might spur you on to consider the possible implications for other areas with heavy human habitation , such as say paris for instance . 
  you referring to kissenger maybe ? 
  because i do n't think chile or bengal agree with that bizarre german supremacist statement . 
  it addresses the assertion that `` the u.s. needs to build better cars '' and the hypocrisy of a such a recommendation . 
  maybe american cars do worse in competition with german cars because they are competing with products with fraudulent consumer info and have to be more rigorously tested and developed . 
  well , we 'll see what happens in the case in a few years . 
  right now fiat chrysler is denying it , so unless they 're gon na be joining the perjury club , we 'll just have to wait and see what happens . 
  if the epa is right , then fuck them too . 
  thanks for the link . 
  i had n't heard of this yet . 
  i would point out however that they are just as much an italian company as an american company though . 
  if you 're talking about the gm scandal , [ the faulty part was chinese ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-recall-china-iduskbn0f01bf20140625 ) . 
  and upon learning of the problem , our regulatory agencies did n't sit on the data for years [ unlike some others ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/commission-has-long-known-of-diesel-emissions-manipulation-a-1103249.html ) , and gm was massively fined and recalled all the cars with that part type . 
  war ? 
  this is just a lover 's quarrel . 
  him being impeached puts pence in the oval office with vp paul ryan . 
  is that really better in your view ? 
  it certainly is n't in my mind . 
  also save the talk of criminality until he has been judged by his peers in court .
