  what is ethical about turning a blind cheek to anyone who is suffering , for any reason , let alone for taking part in our democratic system ? 
  the soviet union was one country , with a multitude of nations . 
  you should n't conflate the two . 
  poland was not a part of the soviet union , but a separate puppet state in its sphere of influence . 
  food scarcity is only one aspect . 
  there are a lot of resources that are vital for maintaining modern civilization that do not exist in the quantities we require for long term use . 
  can all be counted among the necessary base resources for vital technologies that we will desperately need more of in the future . 
  so none of us plebs die for nothing in places none of us should care about . 
  says the azerbaijani in reference to turkey ... 
  everything you said is true . 
  i 'd also like to add that we supplied arms to russia during the crimean war to the list of counterpoints to the mischaracterizations of history in the above . 
  soviet ? 
  this was from communist poland , not communist russia . 
  this is what 's always interesting about natural rights as a concept in inter cultural dialogue . 
  huge differences can exist in what people want to be fundamentally protected . 
  the different american and swiss experiences with firearm proliferation are n't modals but outcomes . 
  poverty creates the situations in which violence is a desirable means . 
  that violence can be expressed through any available means , which in the case of a society with easy access to guns means they become tools of violence . 
  where would that be ? 
  guns are allowed everywhere in the united states due to it being a constitutional right . 
  the collapse in the price of oil started in june 2014 and thus preceded most of the sanctions . 
  the reason food prices went up were mostly self inflicted . 
  the counter sanctions were what created scarcity for many items . 
  the pharmaceutical prices have been impacted by the low ruble , whose value has been depressed since the price of oil collapsed , mostly due to saudi arabia dumping it on the markets at a loss in order to hinder north american shale ventures . 
  the point is to make it more difficult to keep the oligarchs well moneyed , by sapping state assets and reducing wealth transfer mechanisms . 
  if they choose to take that missing money out of the state 's welfare funds then that is them blatantly putting themselves before their people . 
  ~ ~ 4 years ~ ~ 6 years per term for the president of the russian federation with 2 terms allowed consecutively ^ ^ and ^ ^ as ^ ^ many ^ ^ 2 ^ ^ term ^ ^ sets ^ ^ as ^ ^ you ^ ^ want ^ ^ with ^ ^ medvedev ^ ^ tag ^ ^ teaming ^ ^ for ^ ^ you, 
  these sanctions are targeted at financial institutions and state oil ventures , not consumer goods . 
  they 're like dwarfs . 
  they love gold , they live in mountains , ** and they never forget ** . 
  striking for political reasons is for people with money . 
  i would n't expect much in that arena coming from the us . 
  yep . 
  he speaks it fluently with a strong accent . 
  he 's given a speech in the bundestag in the past actually . 
   you ca n't yell fire in a crowded theater mean america does n't have freedom of speech . 
  yes we can . 
  it 's perfectly legal , and it 's a myth perpetrated by those with little to no knowledge of first amendment case law . 
  it was never illegal in the united states because no legislation can lawfully prohibit such a act . 
  it 's a hyperbole that comes from justice wendell holmes jr. 's opinion piece on schenck v. united states ( 1919 ) concerning the applicability of free speech protections for protesting the draft via posters against a possible violation of the espionage act of 1917 . 
  holmes jr. wrote that `` the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic . '', 
  this was merely his opinion as a judge told as a dictum , not a ruling on an actual case about someone shouting fire in a theater . 
  and in any case , schenck v. united states ( 1919 ) was later overturned in brandenburg v. ohio ( 1969 ) , and for good reason !, 
  a series of rulings including schenck v. united states ( 1919 ) concerning the espionage act of 1917 had done more to harm to the right to free speech than anything ever had or since , including the imprisoning of anti war protesters and a political leader in debs v . the united states ( 1919 ) and frohwerk v . the united states ( 1919 ) . 
  brandenburg v. ohio ( 1969 ) is an extremely timely subject for discussion in a thread about a actual criminal conviction for geert wilders for `` incitement '' and `` hate speech '' , because it affirmed the free speech rights of the kkk , unless their speech `` is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action '' , which is a perfectly reasonable standard to uphold . 
  yes . 
  it 's a parody . 
  - cato the eldest, 
  that must be the source of my misunderstanding . 
  thank you . 
  or how you stay in . 
  the uk already had lots of opt outs , and it could certainly still negotiate to a certain degree what its membership looks like in the future . 
  as long as they are a net provider of eu funding , they have the foot in the door to everyone 's ears . 
  i recall one article paraphrasing him saying it could take until 2017 for him to resign . 
  this seemed sudden in comparison . 
  actually , i had assumed that he was just back tracking on resigning and that he was just not going to do it , if he could avoid it . 
  the workers are already punished for their productivity . 
  they 're sharing in none of the increased productivity gains . 
  the increased profits go to the ceos and stake holders instead . 
  wait , last i heard renzi was delaying his resignation for some amount of time . 
  has that changed ? 
  what / u/binary _ spaniard is getting at , i think , is that it would also be secession in france , not conquest . 
  here 's the link : https://www.reddit.com/r/the_schulz/comments/5hduij/urteilt_selbst_angela_merkel_verwickelt_in/, 
  what are the laws in the netherlands concerning what convicted criminals can or ca n't do ? 
  can they still hold public offices ? 
  [ that was the case until the securing the protection of our enduring and established constitutional heritage act of 2010 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speech_act ) of course , that law does n't protect americans who in or have assets in a foreign jurisdiction . 
  the same can be said of trump in this instance . 
  congress wo n't expand libel laws ( hugely bipartisan efforts restricted them last decade ) , and there 's no money to be made in libel suits anyway . 
  it 's extremely hard to prove damages in any kind of defamation case in the us . 
  followed by italy switching side . 
  with no side on the winning side in the conflict , the status quo ante bellum is enforced . 
  rome has oil ? 
  come on boys !, 
  somebody tell / r/hawaii . 
  germany invited us to the second party .

  you 're worried about milk making kids fat , but you 'd want to give them something so sugar laden as fruit ? 
  :p not that there 's anything wrong with fruit , nor is there with milk , but this kind of new age nutritional fad is just silly . 
  you really do n't have to worry about the specifics . 
  just make sure most of the food is n't overly processed , eat a good variety of foods , and get plenty of exercise . 
  it will solve obesity without making people count calories and being afraid of normal foods . 
  calorie numbers are n't as strongly correlated to obesity as you might be thinking . 
  there 's also factors from homeostasis and exercise . 
  there 's nothing wrong with milk as long as you have lactose tolerance and no casein allergies , which is like 95 % of everyone in most western countries . 
  confusing flair is confusing . 
  50 % seems really low for passing . 
  here in the us it 's 60 % for the bare minimum for passing , and i still think that that is too low of a bar . 
  fats are important nutrients , of which milk does n't even have that high concentrations of . 
  [ according to the usda , whole milk can be expected to be composed of roughly 3.25 % fats .

  well , most of canada did . 
  the decision to go to war instead of pursuing canada first neutrality is what sparked quebecois nationalism . 
   we even made nazi mod jokes about it though hue the mods were always called fascists . 
  even before the 2,000 sub mark . 
  different candidates , different times , different policies . 
  i would n't look at that election and think the same outcome is absolutely guaranteed for 2017 . 
  which is basically what i 'm talking about . 
  the french left will not find fillon good enough at all , and le pen will heavily be viewed in the same light . 
  the left often sits out when the only candidates are right wing .
