  [ turkey , belgium , the netherlands , italy , and germany are all host to nato nuke sharing program bases with strategic bombers . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_sharing#nato ) that totals 6 bases . 
  [ germany also has a presence at the incirlik air base in turkey .

  ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/18/politics/u-s-tanks-artillery-norwegian-caves/ ) truth be told , this is really only the tip of the iceberg . 
  if you look more into it , you will find a lot more . 
  i hear you on the real world practicality of pardoning him , but on the other hand our conventional military forces operate under an allowance to never follow an order they find fundamentally unjust , which they can defend themselves for not following in the ensuing court marshal . 
  it rubs me the wrong way that we 'd have two separate codes of moral conduct for the military and intelligence services . 
  i 'd personally like to see snowden tried in a court , so he could be given a decent opportunity to defend himself from the probable espionage charge that would be levied against him if he could be arraigned . 
  let the court decide if the charge has merit , or if what he did was legitimate whistle blowing . 
   why ? 
  it is always about nato , not certain member states but rather nato as a whole . 
  nato is composed of member countries whose individual militaries are not being examined in the comparison with one country 's singular military . 
  nato has a whole lot more on the board than what the infographic is choosing to show you . 
  you also do n't see the expeditionary forces of nato members in other countries either . 
  which is why it 's disingenuous to only be comparing dedicated nato bases to russian national bases , without looking at the national bases of nato members . 
  it 's borderline propaganda to paint the russians as being much more militarized . 
  like most infographs , it 's either methodologically flawed , intellectually lazy , or just straight up propaganda . 
  this one might be all three . 
  it 's cherry picking the bases it chooses to list by comparing some russian national bases with some nato bases , while ignoring national bases from nato members . 
  if they wanted to make a point about who 's really being threatening to who , they should be talking about the differences [ in military exercises ] ( http://gdb.rferl.org/771e2a58-cf5c-4970-922e-7d42ff3c9bfb.png ) and [ whose generals threaten to nuke who .

  is that sour cream or ranch dressing ? 
  try sriracha in mayonnaise and use that as a dip for sweet potato fries . 
  it 's all the rage here in california right now . 
  my inner texan wants to tell you that you are missing out , if you 're not having baked or refried beans at every meal . 
  i agree that it 's extremely overrated , but there are a few regional gems in my experience . 
  the venetian cuttlefish and squid ink dishes really do live up to the hype . 
  i tried looking up the name of one i enjoyed some years back , and i found `` seppia al nero '' , but i 'm not sure if this is the one i 'm thinking of . 
  it had cuts of the cooked cuttlefish meat in the ink sauce . 
  take it from us , revolution is the answer . 
  is this the new `` the spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak '' ? 
  you should n't be so hard on italian pizza . 
  as a genre of stale cracker , it 's * okay * . 
  well , the specific dish known as `` french onion soup '' / `` soupe \u00e0 l\u2019oignon '' is french in origin yes , but it 's predated by numerous onion soups that go back to antiquity . 
  in english , the dish was n't named after them though , but a cutting technique that 's named after them . 
  same with french onion soup . 
  it was first made in st. petersburg , actually . 
  he was , i think . 
  they 're concentrated into one location , so the problem then becomes what happens when the government can subpoena for people 's whole 24/7 activities ? 
  it 's a ridiculous amount of surveillance . 
  it refers to the official name of russia in the same way that the older soyuz ( `` union '' ) class rockets did for the ussr 's name . 
  look at the username of the bot that responded to you . 
  also : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4et0k4pfcvi, 
   my guess is that if sweden was attacked by russia tomorrow , the u.s would respond with military force , despite the fact that they are not a part of nato . 
  that would never happen . 
  the us has no reason whatsoever to intervene . 
  did the us intervene when ukraine was invaded ? 
  georgia ? 
  london has long since had more cctv cameras than all of north korea . 
  if people did n't care about that , they were never going to care about this . 
  if you have no effective military capabilities you 're exploiting the benefits of your own membership without having to pay for the thing we should all be enjoying . 
  it 's a tragedy of the commons , but do n't kid yourself about who is at fault in this impasse . 
  an agreement that your government is willfully flaunting twice now , and spitting in the face of the 5 countries which have kept their word , with their lies . 
   and if a majority is happy with it , like it seems to be ( no demonstrations as well ) we should respect their wish would you protest while martial law is in effect and many 10,000 s of people have been jailed for bogus reasons ? 
  i would n't take a lack of protest as any especially indicative marker for consent here . 
  have you watched [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rstl7nir7gs ) yet ? 
  it puts forward the idea that when the state can subsist and thrive off of natural resources that the elite will grow to no longer promote productivity among the populace as their main source of power ( taxes ) and become oligarchical or worse . 
  basically why the [ resource curse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/resource_curse ) exists . 
  that 's no joke . 
  it 's becoming a serious talking point among african leaders . 
  south africa , burundi , and kenya have left it , and gambia is talking like they want to as well . 
  [ an article for the curious ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/icc-debate-africa-infamous-caucasian-court-161028142708060.html ), 
  we tried that . 
  do n't get into the game , man . 
  they 'll keep dragging you back in . 
  \\* * stamp stamp **, 
  now that 's a ballsy proposal . 
  it would be very , very expensive , require numerous countries leaving the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , probably still end up with global sanctions , and cause numerous other countries to begin their own nuclear arms programs as well . 
  if the german government acts on this , would that mean they do n't trust the french , british , and american nuclear deterrence ? 
  `` sound of may sweating '' also , why is n't there a / r/politicshaikus ?

  a lot of navies including the usn operate on a rotational principle of three , not two . 
  one ready for combat , one in repair , one for training . 
  in any case , what the above user was talking about , was the plans to * mothball * one the two elizabeth carriers due to insufficient funds . 
  i 'm sorry , but i think you 've bought the line that your government knows what it 's doing ... :p `` we have a constitution , that 's totally written down somewhere , but it is n't law and no one knows for sure what it tells us . '', 
  you live in poland as per your flair . 
  i really doubt you 've seen a lot of either ... 
  i never thought i 'd be thanking the nazis for anything , but thanks for making the caesar salute unamerican !, 
  my morning pledges as a kid would have required slightly more effort !, 
  fyi , the eurofighter and gripen do not actually fulfill the exact same combat role as the f35 . 
  they are attack and reconnaissance fighters , whereas the f35 is geared more as a stealth strike craft . 
  they would n't be full replacements for it , if their operating countries wanted the full spectrum of operational capabilities . 
  how do you know what an unwritten constitution entails ? 
  how would you know what an unwritten contract stipulates ? 
  we might need a new geneva convention on shower warfare . 
  not necessarily . 
  in my country for example , changes to the constitution are enumerated as a legislative competence . 
  that 's the advantage of a government that actually has rules . 
  can you really call it a `` constitutional crisis '' when they do n't even have one ? 
  but yeah , their lack of one will cause a lot of schizophrenic behavior from the various branches of their government here . 
  do you use ios using devices ? 
  if so you should look into [ amount ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amount-unit-currency-converter/id560750783?mt=8 ) .

   \u041a\u0440 ** \u0438 ** \u043c \u043d\u0430\u0448 ukrainian spy detected . 
  that 's some next level cost cutting . 
  all you need to do is reinforce the prows and ram the enemies to death . 
  he 's been a little all over the place in party affiliation , to the point where some people think he is just an opportunist . 
  before 1987 he was a democrat , between 1987-1999 he was a republican , between 1999-2001 he was a member of the reform party , between 2001-2009 he was a democrat again , between 2009-2011 he was a republican again , between 2011-2012 he was an independent , and since 2012 he has been a republican yet again . 
  it certainly could n't hurt .
