  the only people that were trying to kill off labor besides the torries , were the neolibs in the party . 
  yuuup . 
  i blame my country actually . 
  i think a lot of other western countries saw clinton 's electoral successes after killing off the dem 's pro labor wing and passing nafta , and their traditional labor parties veered neoliberal too . 
  at around the same time as blair took the mantle of prime minister , schr\u00f6der was leading the sdp ( !!! ), 
  to call for cutting taxes and doing welfare `` reform '' ... 
  just more `` experts '' ... we have the same problem in the us media and in most of the leadership of our `` left '' party . 
  none of them have a handle on what the common people want and think at all . 
  and even though actual left politics would galvanize an overwhelming youth turnout just like in the uk , they keep refusing to do it here , mostly because that would mean having to enact policies that are bad for the bottom lines of their moneyed friends ... 
  the finest troll in the whole world . 
  top tier . 
  everyone else is just a pleb . 
  you do n't have that over there ? 
  it 's a common christmas treat over here in the us . 
  you can pick up [ giant tins of multiflavored popcorns ] ( https://www.kingofpop.com/images/products/signature-samplers/christmas-ornaments-2-gallon-peoples_large.jpg ) to snack on and [ decorate a christmas tree with ] ( http://www.wikihow.com/images/5/5a/string-popcorn-on-a-christmas-tree-step-4.jpg ) . 
  and the caramel ones are the best . 
  this is similar to an idea i 've heard floated over here . 
  a small number of progressives have been talking about wanting congressional districts to have multiple representatives that get determined by proportional representation in that district . 
  it kills first-past-the-post , while keeping regional interests secure in congress , and not having to wade into undoing the connecticut compromise . 
  i like it a lot . 
  something like 5 per district over here would be good in my book , so that every 20 % of the vote gets you a representative . 
  it 's actually lookin ' up there a little . 
  first they came for the socialists ... 
  when rights are n't inherent and universal , who 's in the fucked group can be expanded . 
  and it 's in these kinds of moments that i can be glad about the one and perhaps only single thing american democracy has been designed with better than in the modern european democracies : the absolute supremacy of judical review . 
  just about everything else is outdated and symbolic of the farcically bad democratic deficits we have , but at least tyrannical legislation has the possibility of oversight from the courts . 
  surprise , surprise . 
  a neolib banker values security over freedom . 
  that 's a * guaranteed * non start for being left . 
  [ the trajectory of society is already known . 
  ] ( http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/foa&amp;mounk-27-3.pdf ) we practically know the if , we do n't know the when . 
  that 's the thing . 
  the neoliberals chucked the fervent devotion to personal freedoms that the classical liberals held , but they kept the strong devotion to capitalism ... 
  whenever they want to reduce liberties , no matter what they say , no matter what excuses they use , it 's never temporary , and it 's always a mistake to take them at their word . 
  do n't go full 9/11 , frenchbros . 
  learn from our mistakes , and stop your own version of the patriot act before it happens . 
  `` so , first of all , let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is ... fear itself -- nameless , unreasoning , unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance . '',

  not a brit , but i 've heard that scottish independence is less popular now . 
  this comment confuses me . 
  would you mind explaining it ? 
  [ seize the means of reproduction ] ( https://i.redd.it/necm8o968j2z.gif ), 
   labour on the other hand gained 20 seats 32 is what i read . 
    corbyn has made his point to the rest of his party ( who were trying to pull him under ) that his direction for the party is not that bad at all which strenghtens his overall position in politics . 
  it 's amazing that when you offer people things they want , they show up ... surely youth turnout was just a generational issue up until this point . 
  it could n't have had anything to do with the policy choices ... , 
  oh i 'm well aware of that . 
  [ the results map is in . 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/5l2jjfjgbj2z.jpg ), 
  labor 's up . 
  by a lot . 
  that ai n't losing . 
  right of course . 
  i guess i was thinking of communist trump , from the other timeline . 
  labor 's up 32 seats , torries are down by 13 . 
  but he 's turned it around , and that shows there 's an appetite for his politics and policies . 
  now he just needs to keep expanding the base . 
  all of this happened in only 5 weeks . 
  in a year he can prime the voting population for even better results for the next general election . 
  in a conversation about seasons and months being women 's names , i 'm reading that comment a little differently and humorously ... 
  i know what autumn is . 
  we say that here too , but fall is more common . 
  +32 seats and you call that losing . 
  ** seize the means of reproduction **, 
  alright . 
  thanks again !, 
   it was a demographic and a social anomaly , that is responsible of france 's current economical situations , and that should be resolved and back to normal once this anomaly will be over . 
  would you mind elaborating on this ? 
  what is france 's current economic situation , and in which ways is it tied to things from that period ? 
  that actually seems really relaxing . 
  like you could imagine all the weekend picnics and stuff . 
  [ dat look on his face too ] ( https://i.imgur.com/unyyndc.png ), 
  well okay then . 
  thanks !, 
  would you mind doing the same for the rest of that thread ? 
  it seemed like he had a lot to say . 
  never heard the name autumn . 
  summers , junes , and mays i know though .

  `` best possible brexit '' . 
  `` i 'm the only one you can trust for the negotiations . '', 
  way for them to have constantly implied brexit was a mistake that needs mitigating and remind people it was their party 's fault ... xd,

  we socialists are definitely in the minority , but it seems like most people here do n't like that kind of mindless hatred of it . 
  i can assure you , jezza is very very hung right now . 
  first-past-the-post * always * results in two party systems . 
  always . 
  what ends up happening instead is that each of the two parties functions as a working coalition itself , with people moving between them as time goes on . 
  often with explosive sociopolitical growing pains between the paradigm shifts . 
  here in the us , we 're in our [ 6th political paradigm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_party_system ) , which is breaking apart right now .

   and if trump tries not to during an actual invasion , he 'll be impeached , as i 'm pretty sure that would constitute treason . 
  no and no .
