  it would n't meet the elements necessary for a treason charge , and even if it did , impeachment is basically a pure political tool . 
  the house can simply choose to ignore a crime , which lets be honest , is pretty much guaranteed . 
  can you explain this big l and little l libertarianisms i keep seeing people talking about ? 
  what 's the difference ? 
  oh dear god , it 's from the cato institute . 
  burn it with fire . 
  but little did you know our design has a fatal flaw !, 
  if we aim down the air conditioning shaft and hit the reactor inside , the whole thing explodes , thereby destroying you cheap copy of our glorious doomsday device !, 
  the image says `` freedom '' , but your title says `` democracy '' . 
  what gives ? 
  that being said , [ support for democracy really is declining though .

  they could n't domestically produce every type of good because they 're a small island with no natural resources , that was under embargo and blockade . 
  not because of socialism . 
  what socialism gets them is first world class health care and free education , so that helps a lot . 
   maidenhead holy shit , that 's a real place ? 
  i heard the name on [ this podcast ] ( https://soundcloud.com/chapo-trap-house/uk-election-special-god-save-our-jezza-feat-jonathan-shainin-6617 ) first , but it seemed to be part of a running joke . 
  skip to about 8:04 for the relevant part . 
   and to think they could as prosperous as puerto rico ... 
  it helps not being embargoed by the us , when you 're a small caribbean island . 
  whatever did the british tabloids do before photoshop . 
  the internet of things has clearly gone too far . 
  by far the largest and most populated part though . 
  bohemia more specifically . 
  oops, 
  it 's all of the above , plus it 's just a cultural thing . 
  even non believing families do to their baby boys here . 
  it 's so utterly normalized here it 's perceived as just something you get done like cutting the umbilical cord off . 
  they do n't know any better . 
  they either think its helping them or they 're not really thinking about it . 
  ( and on the hygienic part of your reply , that 's perceived as a legitimate reason to do it , but it 's not actually scientifically true . 
  fucking soap and water is 100 % effective for keeping dicks from smelling . 
  we do n't chop off kids ears because we 're afraid they wo n't wash behind them ... ), 
  mothers choose this for their infant sons here . 
  10 minutes after they 're born . 
  that 's the point . 
  that stops if women stop valuing how their own sons penises look . 
  it actually matters . 
  men who like circumcised girls in africa help sustain the culture that perpetuates it , the same way that women who like circumcised boys help perpetuate it here in america . 
   you were replying to a thread replying this :   i do n't know , right now it 's just the u.s. and britain acting silly right now . 
  they french gave me a little hope . 
  yeah , and i was just zeroing in on the last part . 
   is not a change of paradigm ? 
  how will he change france ? 
  that 's the question you have to ask here . 
  he 's the ex finance minister from the parti socialiste ( which was weakly social democratic if even that , and not socilist ) , no ? 
  what do you really expect to change under him ? 
  from where i 'm sitting , he 's just a new mask on the status quo . 
   is ** not ** inspirational ? 
  24 % in the first round tells me everyone else was just seen as worse . 
  if you 're inspired by him , then good for you . 
  but 3/4ths of the french electorate do n't seem to be , from what it looks like . 
   but here 's the thing , at least we know we have problems . 
  that 's why we 're trying to find solutions and we 're doing new things . 
   you americans still live in a world where everything is fine or if you 're a dem , you probably still think : eh in 3 years will vote him out and we 'll go back to normal , because trump 's appearance on the political scene was totally a fluke , guys !, 
  again with the `` you americans '' . 
  why in the hell are you so fixated on comparing our countries ? 
  you gain * nothing * by pointing out that the us is in worse straits . 
  and guess , what ? 
  i agree with you !, 
  i 'm not a dem . 
  i do n't think all our problems will just go away once they get back in power again . 
  i could rightfully lay the blame on them for some of our persistent problems . 
  and i do . 
  [ i 'm keenly well aware that trump is a symptom , not a disease , and that the issues that brought us him , will still continue to exist and bring us more catastrophes in the future . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/chapotraphouse/comments/6enzg7/former_clinton_advisor_jesse_ferguson_what_the/dibyh2t/?context=3 ) so fucking quit it with the national dick measuring competition . 
  35 % of your population just voted for the party that was founded by nazi collaborators and waffen ss veterans . 
  that 's up ~ 10 % from 2002 , and that should concern you . 
  a lot . 
  i do n't enjoy or relish that fact anymore than i do with the fact that our system is first-pass-the-post and the states vote weightedly instead of the people directly . 
  i literally walked 3 miles up hills both ways in the snow to get to school for years , which is normally just a thing that people joke about here in the us . 
  it was n't just recreation for me . 
  it 's not like there was a few mountains and nothing but flatland around for miles . 
  that is n't how terrain and geology works . 
  this is one of the most kneejerk nationalistic things i 've read in a long time . 
  i did n't talk about america . 
  i 'd be happy to talk about how incredibly fucked up america and its political system is , but doing that wo n't wash away the problems in france . 
  those problems are still going to be with you in 5 years . 
  i do n't know why you 're angry at * me * . 
  do n't shoot the messenger . 
   once britain/france entered the war it became global , hence world war . 
  then you 'd want to argue it started on dec 7th , 1941 with hawaii , the philippines , dutch indonesia , and brtish malay all coming under attack , because it 's only at that moment that the wars in asia and europe converge , with all the final participants now fighting each other . 
  i say just look for the earliest out brake of fighting from the participants though , and that would be japan and china in 1937 . 
  the term `` eurocentric '' gets thrown around a lot , but the idea that it started in 1939 really is completely eurocentric and laughable so .

   may wants gitmo for brit citizens on brit territory . 
  so does trump . 
  he campaigned on sending american muslims there after setting up a registery for them ... 
  this . 
  the milquetoast liberal 's victory is neither inspirational or a paradigm shift . 
  it was a vote against fascism , pure and simple . 
  not a vote for him . 
  he only got 24 % of the vote in the first round . 
  that 's how few people actually believe in the status quo anymore . 
  they just disagree on what the solution should be , and the majority do n't think that fascism is it . 
  humans are the same everywhere though . 
  what 's obvious to you , might be completely unnoticed or irrelevant to others . 
  it 's not necessarily what they actually do , it 's if enough people notice it , internalize it , and then decide that it 's a crucial issue worth changing ones vote for .
