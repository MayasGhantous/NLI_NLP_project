  as we make our way to heaven ... 
  yes there were more conscripts than volunteers , no there was n't a severe lacking of volunteers . 
  both of my grandfathers were enlisted men , for instance . 
  here in america , german and italian pows were even given a small allowance and allowed to into towns , sometimes with escorts sometimes without . 
  the camps for them were administered by the international red cross , and a deal was set up with germany to allow them to receive care packages from home with two way letter service . 
  the deal was supposed to be honored by both nations , but germany reneged on it , and people here became * furious * when we found out that this was how german pows were being treated when our own people were being worked to death in labor camps over there . 
  [ there 's a good radiolab podcast about this . 
  ] ( http://www.radiolab.org/story/nazi-summer-camp/ ) you should give it a listen . 
  the winter war only happened because of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  the germans sold you out as part of the soviet sphere . 
  they were happy to use you for the continuation war though, 
   they partitioned poland along with germany starting wwii and occupied half of europe after the war . 
  wwii had already been raging for 2 years up to that point . 
  it was started by the japanese invading china . 
   if theres a reason that churchill was a very important figure , it was because he urged us to enter the war against the axis powers completely and utterly unsuccessfully . 
  congress would n't hear any of it at all , because the majority of the population was pro neutrality . 
  germany blew it when they declared war on the us . 
  they gave roosevelt exactly what he wanted . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/normandy_landings#allied_order_of_battle ) there were about 73,000 americans and 61,715 brits . 
  other nations had troops assigned to the british 2nd army , but they were n't british . 
  i 'm wondering if op made a translation mistake because english does n't make a distinction between \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0435 and \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 . 
  either claim is weird to me , but one is more unbelievable than the other . 
  forgot a / s at the end ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  mountain hiking is a blast . 
  i used to go up mountains every weekend when i was a kid . 
  :p the view of all the surrounding valleys is incredible !, 
  [ i was thinking of something else .

  she 's not elected . 
  the prime ministership is an appointed position by parliament . 
  that aside , i do n't know how badly this will hurt the tories , if at all . 
  i 've always gotten the feeling that most brits value security over personal freedom and privacy . 
  but maybe i 'm wrong . 
  [ the trend exists in all of western europe .

  who cares what they think . 
  it 's not their bodies . 
  why not advocate for giving women more staying too as well then ? 
  the less pleasure they have the longer they can fuck the men . 
  what 's good for goose is good for the gander , no ? 
  or is it just boys you want to mutilate ? 
  it was meant to be a warning , not a playbook , but whatevs close enough .

   been lights out does this mean good or bad ? 
  because the economy is still bad , and doing worse . 
  the system predates both parties , and even then they are just private organizations , so it 's not for them to even have agreements over such things . 
  compare : < the  / \u00f0\u0259 / [ audio ] ( https://forvo.com/word/the/#en ) < with  / w\u026a\u03b8 / [ audio ] ( https://forvo.com/word/with/#en ), 
  literally all of us everywhere , except for some speakers from jamaica . 
  everyone should have seen it coming when he appointed clintonite wall street cronies like larry summers and alan greenspan , though . 
  there was * never * going to be a recovery for main street america with them at the helm . 
   failed to fill a supreme court seat  not successful at working with opposition party in congress ...  yes republicans obstructed him , but i dont think you can blame it all on that those last two items are 100 % because of nihilistic reactionary and kneejerk opposition . 
  yes it 's southern , no it 's not trashy . 
  i 'd think he 's daydreaming about the expedited coming of a viable arctic passage . 
  as an american , most of the hollywood movies have been absolute garbage for years though . 
  corbyn was actually the only major political figure who wanted brexit . 
  all the torries were just using the threat of it to keep their conservative coalition going . 
  they were under pressure from ukip , so they stole their thunder , and cameron 's referendum went tits up for them . 
  to be fair , they did invade and annex bits of georgia and ukraine in the last decade or so , and the last time they added pelmini to the premises in estonia a lot of people were sent to be worked to death in labor camps in central asia and siberia . 
  sooooo ... 
  do n't get so caught up on the use of the term `` european '' . 
  he 's obviously talking about western culture and civilization . 
  [ enjoy your time in the klink in the renewed war on drugs then . 
  genius idea . 
  harass american tourists , who overwhelmingly tend not to be the people who vote for republican presidents . 
  that 'll show them the error of other people 's ways !, 
  yes , but trump expanded the involvement there . 
  he added ground troops and increased the number and intensity of the bombing campaigns . 
  most americans would rather us not be there * at all * , and it 's not like he could n't order that on day one . 
  there is no real left in american politics . 
  it was really just sanders sitting alone with a barely left of center platform , with everyone else being right wingers . 
  why should the american left leaning electorate get excited about a choice between a neoliberal and a fascist ? 
  that 's a shit choice . 
  you 're kidding right ? 
  things there often run two or three times what they cost at most supermarkets . 
  this should be repeated on every thread , every time this comes up . 
  how odd that it was the fbi and not the cia or nsa . 
  when i was a kid it was my favorite candy . 
  whenever i 'd come home from halloween , i would eat them all up right away . 
  protip : crush em up a little and use them as a topping for ice cream . 
  hawaiian food is pretty great . 
  if you can find it anywhere over there get some [ poke .

  ooh ooh , i have the best marinade recipe for steaks you 've ever heard !, 
  you get flap meat steaks , and then you chop up garlic , add balsamic vinegar , lemon juice , and ground black pepper . 
  than you let it sit for the night in your fridge . 
  it all seeps perfectly into the crevices of the meat , and comes out insanely juicy and flavorful after grilling !, 
  in the summertime i love going to parks and making steakwiches with them and glorious californian sourdough . 
   and also , i agree on the peanut butter front . 
  i never found any that was good when i was living in germany some years back . 
  everyone told me that the dutch make the best over there , but theirs is clearly price gauging . 
  those are just overpriced supermarkets . 
  they 're nothing special . 
  you 're not alone . 
  in general i find it 's the barbecue sauce itself that 's the fault , though . 
  barbecue is not something i 'd recommend to someone visiting the country , but if you talk to most people from the old south they would probably say the opposite . 
  they 're all wonderful . 
  as a word of advice , boston clam chowder ( white chowder ) is much better than manhattan clam chowder ( red chowder ) .
