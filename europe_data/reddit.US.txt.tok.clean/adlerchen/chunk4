  foreign policy is set almost solely by the president . 
  congress might restrain him domestically though depending on how things work out . 
  but maybe not . 
  pence is speculated to have been the price for party loyalty . 
  clinton : 197 trump : 201 virginia just got called in clinton 's favor . 
  the race is n't over quite yet . 
  they 're all blond ? 
  the jokes really are true , are n't they ? 
  that half the us is filled with retards is no news at all to all of the us . 
  [ way down hadestown ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsp2nb8tnhk ) is the best track on that album , imo . 
  god emperor 's do n't have term limits . 
  who is this orange abhuman mutant pretender to the golden throne ? 
  + + + imperial thought for the day + + + hope is the beginning of unhappiness . 
  in the event of a trump presidency , there 's likely going to be a needlessly adversarial foreign policy coming from america . 
  european countries will not be immune from it . 
  for that , i 'm really , really sorry euro bros. :|, 
  oh , there 's a lot of tropical fruits out there !, 
  many of which ca n't really be grown in the us mainland either . 
  at least not very economically ( green houses with artificial environmental conditions ) . 
  it 's just that some cultivars of avocados like the hass avocado from california have a greater degree of cold tolerance , just enough to survive in temperate climates [ like parts of the southern us ] ( https://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2012/lindert_ava/painted%20map%20wiki.png ) , unlike most avocados which can only be grown in tropical climates . 
  at my city 's costume parade last night , i saw plenty of both . 
  it 's interesting how popular video game character costumes have become , but i guess it makes sense . 
  not that i 'm complaining about all the young women in pikachu pajamas mind you . 
  what double speak . 
  never go full 9/11 folks . 
  similarly , america in project plowshare wanted to use three nukes to carve out a coastal harbor in alaska . 
  can someone explain to me how services can be `` exported '' ? 
  do they mean emigration out of the uk ? 
  here in california , papayas and mangoes are widely available . 
  it may be a regional thing . 
  pomegranates can be purchased , but they are a little harder to find . 
  avocados do n't do well in the cold . 
  most of europe is completely unsuitable to growing them . 
  here in california the growing season for them is between february and september with the peak in production in the summer months . 
  that simply ca n't be done in almost all of europe , and anecdotally , the avocados i 've had in germany had a very short shelf life and inferior texture and size compared to what i 'm used to . 
  kung pao chicken is actually legitimately chinese in origin . 
  it was just popularized in the west by american chinese restaurants . 
  it was created by a chef named kung pao who came from chongqing in sichuan . 
  0.2 of a tree . 
  so if one side of the treaty book has the eu 's star wreath , then does the other side have canada 's maple leaf ? 
  but abraham lincoln could get a `` third party '' off the ground . 
  it 's still putting forward candidates even today . 
  to do so it had to out compete the whigs and the democrats . 
  saying that the bull moose party failed to elect a president and thus the system ca n't allow for a `` third party '' candidate , is irrational . 
  it 's like using the green party as evidence that there will only ever be two parties ( there 's never been only two ) . 
  what i 've said are not strawmans , but the logical conclusions to what you 've been saying , even though you do n't seem to see how those conclusions stem from your starting assumptions . 
   only in this case the eu require 28 national parliaments ( and some regional parliaments ? ), 
  it 's one of the national parliaments that requires their own regional parliaments . 
  the eu only needs those regional parliaments indirectly through the national parliament that governs them , which in turn requires their direct approval . 
  what are the current tariffs on imported maple syrup in your jurisdiction ? 
  it 's gon na be that much cheaper , if all the relevant tariffs have been removed . 
  there 's still gon na be other taxes exacted by your government though plus a base price which is n't that low anyway since maple syrup is difficult to produce in large quantities . 
  no no , you do n't understand . 
  the eu ca n't afford to sign ftas with countries with lower labor and environmental standards . 
  xd at least merkel had the balls to point out that a lot of the flak that ttip had gotten was only because it involved america ... 
  not only can trump not win , no republican can win the presidency . 
  trump and clinton are not tied . 
  [ clinton has consistently won almost every single poll there is . 
  ] ( http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html ) this is only the tip of the iceburg for the coming political reality of demographics increasingly favoring the democrats . 
  trump has no chance of winning , and neither will any republicans for generations . 
  voting for them is what people stupidly call a `` wasted vote '' god i hate that term ... all i 'm trying to point out , is that voting for sure winners because they 're gon na win is silly . 
  there 's no need to be on the winning team . 
  that is n't a meaningful goal in itself . 
  so the eu vote on ratification can only start * after * approval from the individual eu member states ? 
  do i have that right ? 
  well , then you 're advocating for a two party state on the grounds that any other party is bad because they do n't win , even though one of those two parties your advocating a monopoly on power for will also certainly fail anyway . 
  trump is just as much of a `` spoiler '' for clinton as any other candidate . 
  he absolutely ca n't win . 
  but does that mean he should n't run ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  statistically speaking , republicans have little to no chance to win a presidential election anymore due to demographic shifts . 
  in your view , any republican candidate is therefore a `` spoiler '' and should n't be voted for by anyone because they would n't win anyway . 
  that would leave the other parties ' candidates and non partisan candidates , but i 'm guessing of those in your view only the democrats are not `` spoilers '' . 
  on the other hand , having a public discussion on the merits of westward expansion for visegrad would be hilarious . 
  i was talking about relatedness , not intelligibility . 
  they 're separate aspects . 
  so only people who will win should run ? 
  you 're advocating for a one party state here . 
  it was a pun on [ pole ] ( http://www.parsakhgar.com/images/traditional-aluminum-light-pole.jpg ) and [ pole ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/herb_polski.svg/653px-herb_polski.svg.png ) . 
  what makes certain candidates `` spoilers '' and others not ? 
  why is it idiotic to vote for them over the not `` spoilers '' ? 
  that 's a may pole right ? 
  potato is multifunctional tool ? 
  but boris is estonian , not latvian . 
  so are english and polish . 
  just more distantly . 
  then i 'm not sure what you 're getting at . 
  no one who 's ever occupied her office has been elected to that position . 
  i do n't see what makes her special here . 
   may a head of state that has never been eelected democratically to her position . 
  that would be every prime minster in the uk though right ? 
  they vote for parties , not candidates right ? 
  `` ancient astronaut archive '' ?? 
  is this really worth my time ? 
  it was just concluded this year . 
  i do n't know when it will take effect though . 
  how does treaty ratification work for the eu ? 
  since the eu was a singular party to the treaty negotiations , does n't that mean that only the eu and canada as the only parties have to ratify the treaty ? 
  or do individual eu members have to unanimously ratify eu level treaties for them to take effect ? 
  he 's implying that they use the eu to selfishly advance their own narrow interests .
