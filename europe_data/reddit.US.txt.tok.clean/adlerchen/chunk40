   as for liberal becoming an insult , i think that 's a fairly recent phenomenon . 
  i think it 's come from the `` social justice warrior '' crap that has in the last couple of years started to leak out of the internet into real life here in the us . 
  god no . 
  conservatives in the us saying `` liberals '' with absolute venom , goes back before the internet . 
  just look up right wing radio since the 90s , like rush limbaugh . 
  you have it backwards : it got on the internet because people were talking that way already in `` real life '' .

  if you 're referring to normandy , the us had already landed in europe before that . 
  the invasion of italy via north africa had already occurred and us and other allied forces were continuing to fight up north through the peninsula as dday started . 
  in reference to nuclear research , far less of it came from the uk than you imply . 
  the uk had a head start but was quickly left behind as time went on . 
  [ r ~ \u0280 ~ \u0281 ] are all possible realizations for a single rhotic phoneme . 
  it depends a lot on the dialect actually . 
  in southern dialects like bayerisch and allemanisch it 's realized as [ r ] . 
  in central and northern germany it 's a mostly allophonic variation between [ \u0280 ~ \u0281 ] . 
  and since standard hochdeutsch comes historically from s\u00e4chsisch and ostfr\u00e4nkisch , [ \u0280 ~ \u0281 ] is considered the standard . 
  none of that applies in this case however as the rhotic phoneme is n't even found in the phrase . 
  what 's throwing you off is that a < r  appears in the orthography , but that does n't mark a consonant . 
  it 's marking part of a vowel diphthong . 
  back when i was a student , i made a ipa cheat sheet for german to help me out , and [ here is the relevant snippet for this . 
  it really depends on the country . 
  in some child foreign language learners learn it , and others it 's not used for that . 
  technically speaking there have been 6 revisions since 1886 . 
  the current iteration is the 2005 version , which replaced the 1996 version . 
  many recent papers and monographs still use the 1996 version because that 's what those researchers were trained to use . 
  :p the above user obviously ca n't read ipa and would n't know any of this , though .

  also remember to pair a good wine with the food , you peasant . 
  you 're overstating the effect that reddit and social media had , i think . 
  america had problems that contributed to our election and its outcome that are not dependent on online word of mouth . 
  i 'm assuming this is either a real or simulated bad google translate of the english phrase , and that `` breaks\u00c9 '' does n't really mean anything outside of helping to signify the awkwardness of the french . 
  some politicians are n't shit . 
  they 're rare though . 
  i mean , europe is tiny . 
  i can admit that that comment was made before my morning coffee though . 
  could 've fooled me . 
  i 'm pretty sure i studied and worked there some years back , but what do i know . 
  go to the uk instead . 
  they ca n't say anything . 
  i feel you . 
  this is exactly why i advocate for a national vote and abolishing the ec . 
  it should n't matter where americans are when they cast their ballot . 
  enough with the votes being awarded to the states . 
  it should be one man one vote , and all the votes are counted together and the winner is the one who got the most . 
  it would solve the problem of having a minority opinion like yourself but it not mattering because it 's the state which votes , not the voters themselves . 
  and it would solve the problem of americans living in the right squares of land being over represented in the state voting system . 
  everyone should be able to vote and have it mean something . 
  we 're not `` spoiled as fuck '' in the ec system at all though : state | population | ec votes | ratio -- | -- | -- | -- california | 39,250,000 | 55 | 1:713,636 wyoming | 586,000 | 3 | 1:195,333 montana | 1,042,520 | 3 | 1:347,506 alaska | 738,432 | 3 | 1:246,144 look at this . 
  for every 713,000 people we have we get 1 vote , but for every 195,000 people wyoming has they get 1 vote as well . 
  it 's insane . 
  they have 3 times the influence and importance we have , and it 's compounded by the fact they have 2 senators just like us . 
  the whole system is rigged against american communities that are statistically larger than the average . 
  it should n't be like this . 
  write in m\u00e9lenchon . 
  xd it wo n't effect the outcome of an election for a country you do n't live in , but it might make a vote counter laugh . 
  \\ ^ \\ ^ \\ ^ red hat scum, 
  you act like i said that la or nyc should have 100 electoral votes each or be the only voters allowed .
