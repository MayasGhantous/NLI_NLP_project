  why ca n't we just have an * equal * say in this worthless excuse for a country ?? 
  my vote here in california counts for 1/3 what a montanan 's vote does . 
  the people who do decide who the president is and control the whole process is n't us . 
  some are bots ( look at my comment history pointing out account age and stuff for other users here ) , some are shills ( bots and shills often work in tandem ) , some are just morons who want to support the woman that their dementia ridden geriatric of a commander and chief endorsed , and some might just be trolls . 
  almost no americans actually pay attention to other countries for anything . 
  these are just weird ones . 
  because obviously the `` general pulse '' of a nation can best be determined from a minroty of the voters and not the majority ... 
  i 'm sure you actually think the us is n't the shame democracy that it is . 
  the problem is her opponent is a liberal ex banker . 
  i do n't think many french see it in those terms . 
  it would depend who you 're talking with . 
  among left leaning individuals he 's not so very popular . 
  among liberals he 's their guy of course . 
  then there are the very pro eu people regardless of other political opinions , who appreciate that he was basically the only major pro eu candidate . 
  and finally there are many reluctant voters of all stripes who are voting against le pen and not for him . 
  he only got ~ 25 % in the first round , so i would n't quite frame things around him being `` sooo popular '' . 
  i do n't think that he is . 
  the best things going for him are that he is pro eu which is a respectable position in france , and of course that he is n't le pen . 
  my disclaimer is that i 'm not french , but i 'd like to think that after reading up and listening to people talk here , i 'd have an okay handle on the situation . 
  the front national was started by nazi collaborators and ex waffen ss volunteers . 
  look it up . 
  this is a well known part of the history of the party .

  oh , well never mind then . 
  could n't you just vote from a french consulate or embassy in portugal ? 
  during the first round i saw footage of french people lining up to vote at the french embassy in vietnam . 
   degenerates just look at this projection . 
  subconsciously you realize that you 're pure filth and utterly worthless .

  you do n't even know what left wing is . 
  macron is a liberal , which is to say a center right capitalist . 
  the left wing candidate ( m\u00e9lenchon ) was n't very popular here either during the first round .

  yes , go and check out the russian propaganda front that [ is run out of moscow ... ] ( https://whois.domaintools.com/141.105.65.113 ) surely they will have information totally not harmful to france ... surely ...

  you do n't have a single post in french , and in one post you say you voted for trump because you got persuaded to on reddit . 
  you ca n't even fucking read the emails or any news reports about them , so keep your assurances to their veracity to yourself .

  gives historical context to ongoing events now ( or at least one view on the events that have lead up to now ) . 
  that one is even painful for me , and i do n't even speak a lick of french .

  i 'm personally partial to the `` traditionalist international '' , [ as some commentators and reporters have called it before . 
  ] ( http://www.rightwingwatch.org/report/the-rise-of-the-traditionalist-international-how-the-american-right-learned-to-love-moscow-in-the-era-of-trump/ ) that being said , `` fascist international '' would be more honest , but i doubt it will catch on . 
  watching them squirm and contort to protect their benefactors is hilarious , but the sad truth is that a lot of gullible people will still believe them . 
   3 ) they are influenced by russia . 
  influence is an enormous understatement . 
  [ they 're literally run out of moscow . 
  ] ( https://whois.domaintools.com/141.105.65.113 ) they are in all probability a front for the fsb or gru to disseminate what russian intelligence hacks and obtains from other countries . 
  this is why they have never released documents damaging to russia and their interests , and have actively refused to do so in the past . 
  putting banners up can hardly be described as `` harassment '' , if you ask me . 
  but what do i know . 
  i 'm not a 3 day old account like you are . 
   it 's also not like reactionary internet campaign actually run some elaborate targeting scheme , they just throw tons of shit and home that some of it sticks and that 's where you 'd be wrong . 
  you should read [ this .

  for aircraft carriers without a catapult launch system , yes . 
  otherwise you want a f-35c . 
  maybe it 's just a british thing then . 
  i 'm pretty sure that it 's not even an antiquated usage . 
  i ca n't recall ever seeing it in any early to late modern english i 've ever seen . 
  just to let you know , in english countries are referred to by `` it '' , not `` she '' . 
  as for a stylistic pointer , i 'd have said :  ** spain ** could . 
  i mean ** , ** it would ensure ~ ~ the ~ ~ permanent ** hatred ** of all of catalonia 's citizens towards the spanish state and plunge one of iberia 's richest economic ~ ~ al ~ ~ regions into political chaos . 
   but ** it ** totally could . 
  the problem is the experience and training they bring back to 10,000 of others . 
  and as a non eu and non nato country , spain could invade an independent catalonia and force it to take a share of the debt . 
  never underestimate how much pride can overpower reason . 
  what 's in spain 's long term interests can easily take a backseat to saving face if the wrong people are at the wheel . 
  with the strong and outspoken catalonian independence movement i 'm surprised barcelona is being considered right now . 
   we saw white flight in cities in united states . 
  the exact thing is happening in europe , except the group coming in is muslims . 
  white flight did n't happen in the us because cities were dangerous . 
  it happened because of the the economic boom in the 1950 's , when the suburbs were being built and homes for the first time were affordable for the middle class . 
  white people started moving out of cities because they were the only ones most banks would give major loans to and most existent homeowners would allow to buy or rent their way into their neighborhoods . 
  this left those cities with highly depleted and hollowed out tax bases which caused infrastructure and education to suffer , and it would n't be until many decades later that they would rise in prominence again . 
  this is exactly what happened to detroit , but also to many hundreds of small and large cities . 
  this is actually something that 's changing back in the us slowly . 
  my generation , the millennials , are the first in 40-50 years who prefer to live in cities over suburbs and so those of us who grew up in suburbs are generally moving back . 
  homes are no longer affordable at all and most of do n't think they ever will be again , and so there 's no reason to stick around in the suburbs when the cities have all the jobs and all the excitement . 
  france is n't completely reliant on a single natural resource that could have its price collapse at a random time . 
  and renzi 's thumb pointed down ... 
  you do n't know what 's fucking going on here , pole . 
  ** i do . 
  ** i live in california . 
  you live 8000 miles away reading tweets about it from people with the biggest victim complexes in the whole world . 
  just read this : https://itsgoingdown.org/berkeley-violent-trump-supporters-merging-alt-right/ actual neonazis like `` identity evropa '' and the `` sons of odin '' are having fucking armed rallies in our universities , and despite the image of california you may have , we do have such groups in disturbingly high numbers in some places , and the sacramento -- san joaquin river delta is one such place where they are coming into the bay area from . 
  also have a looksie here if you do n't believe me : https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map stop pretending you have even the slightest idea what 's going on , and listen to someone who actually lives here . 
  a summary of the press situation :  ** media freedom and pluralism in jeopardy **  just weeks after winning the 2015 parliamentary elections , the conservative law and justice party passed a media law in december 2015 giving the government direct control over public broadcasting .
