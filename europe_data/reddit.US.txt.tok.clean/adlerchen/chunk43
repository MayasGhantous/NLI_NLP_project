  did they selfishly think the ban was only going to effect * other groups * , or did the policy come out of nowhere ?

  the difference gets blurred when you start thinking about protecting sources and protections for journalists trying to protect sources . 
  in the us over the last ~ 6 years , the government has argued unwaveringly in litigation that there is no reporter 's privilege in various kinds of criminal investigations . 
  2 year old account , but only 20 comments . 
  hmmmm . 
  that 's exactly what i was thinking when i saw that . 
  this measure has to be purely employer - and investor-centric , for them to be saying this bullshit . 
  in the us , there are barely any sick or vacation days , no guaranteed maternity leave , no guaranteed health insurance for the employees , and shit wages for 99 % of industries . 
  that 's * not * `` economic freedom '' for the workers . 
  very true . 
  what makes great politics does n't always make great policy . 
  populists can get carried away or just want to win at any cost , and thus promise way more than what 's actually feasible to deliver . 
   ** government interference in public broadcasting **  journalists investigating corruption , organized crime , or war crimes are often subjected to harassment campaigns . 
  defamation is criminalized and insulting `` the republic , its emblem , its national hymn or flag '' is punishable by up to three years in prison . 
  worse still , `` humiliating '' media content has been criminalized since 2013 . 
  government interference in the croatian public broadcasting company hrt challenges media freedom and media independence in the country . 
  croatia 's parliament fired hrt 's director-general in march 2016 and appointed an acting director who proceeded to demote or reassign approximately 70 journalists and editors as part of what critics have called an ideologically driven `` purge .

  there was never a way to meet the robustness of democratic institutions criteria for the acquis chapters , with so much power concentrated in one branch with so little checks on it anymore .

  i 'm not sure there 's any logic to the color gradient , but in any case , turkey is only 5 places away from the first black country ( burundi , rank 160 ) . 
  europe to erdogan : `` get off our lawn ! '', 
  the idea had been floating around among intellectuals all over europe for decades before that , but yes , sweden was the first country to implement it into law , followed by mine in 1789 . 
  a journalist was once made to wait 30 whole minutes before an interview , and they did n't even offer her two open faced sandwiches with her coffee !, 
  unbelievable !, 
  the counts are there because in some countries it 's actually dangerous to do real journalism or to even make certain comments . 
  in many they incarcerate them without a trial or if they have a trial it 's a kangaroo court , in others they also murder them to keep their noses out of certain subjects . 
  the counts are listed for each country in the index , and for most it 's 0 for all 3 stats most every year . 
  smog has n't really been a problem here since the 90s . 
  that 's when state regulations really got up to speed and enforcement was strengthened . 
  and even then , there had been many improvements before that . 
  overall , i would say that visibility suffering is more like a once a month thing , and even then it 's not so bad . 
  it 's been a big change from [ what it used to be like ] ( http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/files/2016/03/la.jpg ) , which is where the now outdated stereotype comes from . 
  yeah , no kidding . 
  of the endless complaints about the man , one of the few that was n't unfounded propaganda was the abject crack down on whistle blowers that happened under his administration . 
  the so called president says [ this , ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/832708293516632065 ) and his entire staff regularly lie to the press for sport , and you 'd think that ? 
  at this point , i 'm wondering when we 're going to have our first murdered journalist . 
  considering how many european countries have had deteriorating conditions for journalists over the last 10 years , i 'm not so sure i would say that . 
  the historical data is worth a look : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index#rankings_and_scores_by_country,

  [ * the most independent * ] ( https://whois.domaintools.com/141.105.65.113 ) . 
   ** media freedom and pluralism in jeopardy **  just weeks after winning the 2015 parliamentary elections , the conservative law and justice party passed a media law in december 2015 giving the government direct control over public broadcasting . 
  it immediately used this power to dismiss those running the state radio and tv stations . 
  after turning the state media into propaganda tools , the government tried to financially throttle several independent print media outlets ( including gazeta wyborcza , polityka and newsweek polska ) by ordering all state agencies to cancel their subscriptions . 
  in december 2016 , the government had to abandon plans to restrict media access to parliament after thousands of people took to the streets in a show of concern about media freedom . 
  concern is now focused on a proposed law to `` re-polishize '' the country 's press by setting a limit on the level of foreign capital in polish media companies . 
  alarmed to see a european union member flouting fundamental eu values , the european commission launched a procedure in january 2016 that is designed to ensure respect for the rule of law . 
  in response to the grave and repeated violations of media freedom and pluralism , rsf issued a call to the eu in october 2016 to impose sanctions on poland , including financial sanctions .

  those that have to actually crunch the numbers in their own government tend not to like populists for a reason .

   ** stifling atmosphere for independent journalists **  what with draconian laws and website blocking , the pressure on independent media has grown steadily since vladimir putin 's return to the kremlin in 2012 . 
  leading independent news outlets have either been brought under control or throttled out of existence . 
  as tv channels continue to inundate viewers with propaganda , the climate has become increasingly oppressive for those who try to maintain quality journalism or question the new patriotic and neo-conservative . 
  more and more bloggers are receiving prisons sentences for their activity on online social networks . 
  the leading human rights ngos have been declared `` foreign agents . '' the oppressive climate at the national level encourages powerful provincial officials far from moscow to crack down even harder on their media critics .
