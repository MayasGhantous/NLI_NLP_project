  goodnight . '', 
  next time you 're back , pm me so i can give you lots of suggestions for things to do and see and eat .

  [ shamelessly plugging my own hometown of la for more glorious winter-mountain-city porn .

   while smugly wiping the dribble off your chin and onto your cheeto-stained t shirt look at all this projection , right here on display . 
   she is 40 % of french . 
  and 60 % foreign money . 
  check its comment history . 
  did you look at all the massively downvoted comments as well ? 
  did you look at the comment histories of those posting them ? 
  bot sockpuppet strategies do n't typically spam upvotes/likes . 
  they operate as narrative amplifiers by using cookie cutter adaptive text algorithms . 
  read up at / r/shills, 
  9 hour old account . 
  for years i never used a flair because i did n't want people to judge what i was saying on account of where i 'm from . 
  i only started using one this year because my country is in the news a lot here now , and even then , look at the text for it . 
  maybe it 's become like it has in my country , where social concerns began to trump economic concerns among the poor in many regions ? 
  does that sound plausible to anyone who lives in those regions ? 
  [ this book ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54666.what_s_the_matter_with_kansas_how_conservatives_won_the_heart_of_america ) is a must read that explains how it happened over here . 
  it 's pretty hard for them to bring themselves to vote for a liberal , and especially not for a banker . 
  he represents everything they distrust and think is hurting their country . 
  the so called `` pacte r\u00e9publicain '' wo n't hold much with them . 
   t_d is ~ ~ american ~ ~ russian, 
  he did it 4 months out from the election . 
  he did n't take his time to do so at all . 
  he was just waiting for the races to finish before dropping out . 
  and no , we 're not loony . 
  we just believe in an america that looks after its own . 
  yes and no . 
  passions certainly have been stoked by propaganda to a certain extent . 
  [ judging by the rhetoric ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-luc_m%c3%a9lenchon#anti-german_sentiment ) , would n't that be a melenchon victory ? 
  technically true , but the eu has been intractable when it comes to monumental and structural demands from single member states . 
  melenchon is pretty much saying he 's going to pull a david cameron , and we all know how that went . 
  do you think there are any major political ideologies and identities that are floating around in the french populace which are n't represented in the 2017 election ? 
  and if so , what ? 
  i ca n't figure out what you 're saying , but i 'm pretty sure you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  there has only ever been one constitutional convention is us history , the one in 1787 , which gave us our current constitution and throw out the articles of confederation . 
  the primaries are not an `` integral part of the us political system '' . 
  they have no basis in law , they are merely private events held by private organizations . 
  any party could cease to run them at their own discretion . 
  there 's pretty much always been more than two candidates in the election though . 
  the primaries are just privately held elections that some parties run . 
  they are n't held because it 's part of the system as stipulated in the constitution . 
  they 're a historical product from the last century after the current two main parties decided to let their voters pick the candidate for the presidency . 
  before that , all the parties chose their candidate themselves , or in cases could n't agree and ended up with multiple candidates accidentally , such as [ in 1860 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election,_1860 ) . 
  that would make a lot more sense . 
  the us primaries ? 
  [ in 2016 it was 17.3 % . 
  ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/08/so-far-turnout-in-this-years-primaries-rivals-2008-record/ ) however , i would not say they are equivalent to the first round in the french election . 
  in the us , the primaries are just for determining who is each parties ' candidate , and many people simply do n't care who the individual candidate is since they intend to vote for their party no matter what . 
  in the us primary elections you do n't get to vote on the presidency , your representative and senators , and local and state referendums like in the actual election . 
  the us general election saw [ ~ 58 % turnout that same year . 
  ] ( http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/voter-turnout-2016-elections/ ), 
  france 24 's live stream said the first round is only expected to have about ~ 28 % turnout . 
  they also said it was the same for the last election . 
  why is it so low in france ? 
  anyone have an idea ? 
  the number blows me away considering the huge differences between the candidates . 
  \\* head explodes \\* & nbsp ; ^ ^ just ^ ^ joking , ^ ^ i ^ ^ know ^ ^ what ^ ^ the ^ ^ terms ^ ^ mean ^ ^ in ^ ^ your ^ ^ guys ' ^ ^ political ^ ^ context, 
   nobody hates germany . 
  it 's just a matter of being naive and gullible : in politics and diplomacy , there is no such thing as `` friends '' . 
  there are allies , there are partners , and there are interests , either shared or differing . 
  oh , there are definitely friends in international relations and politics , i think . 
  people remember for their whole lives what countries do for or against them . 
  all that being said , welcome to the big leagues germany !, 
  you ca n't do anything right anymore , because no matter what you do and no matter what your intentions are , people still need their scapegoats , and you 're the one on stage right now . 
  maybe his voters want stability the most , and the other three will rock the boat more than he will ? 
  more a vote against the others than a voter for him . 
  4 candidates roughly within the margin of error . 
  this is going to be a surprise for everyone , and do n't let anyone tell you otherwise . 
  it will be interesting to see what happens . 
  it 's goal was for scientists and those that support their work to demand for evidence-based policy making , more science education , and more research funding . 
  i mean , i 'm most interested in grammaticalization , morphosyntax , and typology . 
  i was just skimming my library for quick examples , and this is what i saw first out of the grab bag . 
  :p of course i 've read his work though !, 
  it just is n't very relevant to what i study . 
  well , i ca n't argue with that logic !, 
  the scientific method is n't exclusive to the disciplines that study the natural world . 
  the social sciences are well established and have their own peer review . 
  if you think you see problems with any papers and monographs , why do n't you write in to those journals ? 
  or are you actually not college educated and are talking out of your ass , because you believe what two bit blogs and social media comments tell you to think ? 
   but also publish their opinion pieces as if they were science like a physics paper . 
  and here we can plainly see that you have n't read papers from both worlds . 
  what , you do n't think that scientists of the natural sciences do n't have opinions , and do n't offer them for public scrutiny in their papers and monographs ?? 
  i have rarely if ever seen a conclusion section which did n't offer up interpretations on the data and new hypotheses to explain it . 
  i study linguistics , which is necessarily multidisciplinary due to the nature of the questions that are addressed under its guise , and i see papers all the time that have data driven analysis like [ maurits , perfors , navarro 2010 ] ( http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/nips2010_0369.pdf ) and [ dye , walenski , prado , mostofsky , ullman 2013 ] ( https://brainlang.georgetown.edu/sites/brainlang/files/documents/dye_plos-one_13_0.pdf ) and purely theoretical work like [ delancey 2005 ] ( http://celia.cnrs.fr/fichext/documents%20de%20travail/ergativite/3ddelancey.pdf ) and [ mithun 1984 ] ( http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/mithun/pdfs/1984%20the%20evolution%20of%20noun%20incorporation.pdf ) . 
   obama campaigned on closing gitmo and no more interventions . 
  he came incredibly close to being able to close it down , but congress kept undermining his ability to do so . 
  he also did decouple the us from the middle east to a large degree until the arab spring happened , and i think he then vacillated between keeping his campaign promises to stop interventionism and support the grass roots pro democratic movements . 
  paging u/savannajeff, 
  yup . 
  brexit is bad for the eu , it 's especially bad for britain , and it also screws with western cooperation across the atlantic to boot . 
  nato and the eu are the twin pillars that keep the west cohesive and strong , so damage to either is concerning . 
  and it was only politically controversial because people in my country attribute industrial job loses to nafta , instead of automation and the erosion of unions . 
  people are expecting the same from ttip . 
  who 's `` you '' ? 
   and further proof of the us not being our ally , especially under this administration . 
  only under this administration , not especially . 
  up until now , the us has had a otherwise unbroken streak or support for the eu , eu integration , and individual european countries and their people .
