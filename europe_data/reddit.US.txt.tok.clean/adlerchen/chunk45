  no no , america first , eu second , britain third . 
  they prefer lots of sun while on vacations , so they typically go to volgagrad instead . 
  surprising no one who knows what 's what , whatsoever . 
  of course a 400 million person market is going to be prioritized and get its way over a 60 million person market . 
  we still love you brits though . 
  it 's goal was for scientists and those that support their work to demand for evidence-based policy making , more science education , and more research funding . 
  = `` have your own opinions , but not your own facts ! '', 
  the idea originated in the us , i believe . 
  it was international . 
  you can find all the marches [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.marchforscience.com/satellite-marches/ ) here are some photos that were posted to / r/losangeles , which is my city : https://i.imgur.com/9odmxlf.jpg https://i.imgur.com/azbbs9r.jpg https://i.redd.it/wgqm0m6zh5ty.png next saturday there will be another international march as well . 
  it 's the [ people 's climate march ] ( https://peoplesclimate.org/ ) , and its goal is to demand for solutions to climate change , protections for clean air and water , ensuring the protections for a free press and for protesting , and an end to attacks on immigrant communities . 
  [ you can find find a local march here .

  oh look , projection . 
  it 's a shame your mother dropped you so many times . 
  power is n't about what 's scribbled down on paper . 
  that only matters if people still work within a system of rules as a matter of course . 
  trump and the republican party have increasingly been flaunting the law . 
  he 's a russian nationalist , if you somehow could n't tell . 
  you ca n't use nukes in a conventional conflict unless you 're fine with escalating to mad . 
  that 's only a deterrent if the other side thinks you 'll actually escalate to mad . 
  it 's better to actually have conventional parity and keep the nukes in the back pocket in case they escalate the conflict . 
  a meaninglessly unspecific truism . 
  they 're pretty much all government controlled or have been threatened and cowed into compliance . 
   when the eurasian powers will unite . 
  unite around * what * . 
  it 's much much easier to replace track or a depo than a port or a cargo vessel . 
   eu , us , ** china ** and others should close russian borders from outside . 
  good luck with that . 
  germany , france , and the eu all had better responses which acknowledged the irregular circumstances that underpinned the referendum and gave an open reminder to erdogan that turkey is quite divided . 
  make d\u00f6ner pirogies and split the amount in half . 
  that 's because the us political scene is so fucked . 
  in no way is fox news centrist . 
  not even an iota . 
  the worst part is that even though the dictators tell everyone in advance before they do it , people still wonder how they got there . 
  they just ca n't believe their ears because the urge to rationalize and ignore what they 're hearing is too strong . 
  religion is just an excuse to take power . 
  no choice was needed . 
  le pen would congratulate him too . 
  all the far right authoritarians are on the same side . 
  trump is jealous and orban is taking notes . 
  just get a chinese knockoff then . 
  they 're made in the same place anyway . 
  i 'm sure you would have nodded approvingly at a rwandan telling a worried liberal russian in 2003 that he did n't know what he was talking about . 
  it always starts with the rhetoric . 
  then over time they seize enough power to start doing it . 
   at least american journalists and politicians are n't jailed . 
  [ yet ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/832708293516632065 )  at least american citizens do n't get jailed just because they speak against trump or make fun of him on social media . 
  [ yet ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/853597199619543041 ) i 'll remind you that things did n't turn out like they are in turkey in only a few months . 
  before you go mouthing off off about how okay things are over here , you should know that we 're on the same trend . 
   other than there not being a parliament in the us thing , we call it `` congress '' , and yes there is . 
   the president can create law . 
  that 's what executive orders are as are regulations that affect executive agencies . 
  it 's true however that he ca n't create statutory law , but that 's only one facet of law . 
  fyi , courts may also create judicial law . 
  god no . 
  executive orders have no force of law whatsoever . 
  they are written orders to his subordinates in his branch of government . 
  they confer no binding obligations to anyone else at all . 
  germany declared war on france and belgium , bringing the uk in as well . 
  they certainly have a big portion of the responsibility for the war . 
  they have the first round of their elections in a few days . 
  afterwords they 'll have the run off second round , and two of the leading candidates are a russian puppet neonazi ( le pen ) and a kinda far out eurosceptic ( mel\u00e9nchon ) . 
  a runoff between the two would probably guaranty harm to france and the eu . 
  it 's a shill or bot account . 
  check the comment history . 
  it 's a three year old account , but only has a relative handful of comments , with year long breaks in between reactivations . 
  judging by the rambling non sequiturs , i 'm leaning heavily towards it being a bot . 
   in the us you strongly defend you constitution and rights so a dictator-like-character can be restricted can is different than is . 
  the current president has already violated the constitution twice now ( emoluments clause , and no congressional authorization for strikes on the syrian military ) , and yet congress fails to act . 
  this is a debatable point by itself , but it 's worth mentioning that in a vacuum congress is really the strongest branch of government in the us system , and that 's by constitutional design . 
  many of the powers and responsibilities of the executive derive solely from legislation , which congress could rescind at anytime . 
  they could , for example , unilaterally strip the president of the entirety of the us military by repealing [ chapter 7 , statute 1-49 ] ( http://legisworks.org/sal/1/stats/statute-1-pg49a.pdf ) . 
  the constitution grants congress the authority to raise armies and navies , but they do n't actually have to and they do n't have to have it set up so that it answers to the office of the presidency . 
  this is a 19 hour old account , and clearly this comment is just meant for propaganda or is just an expression of useful idiocy , but for anyone who comes by and what he said sounds sort of right , know this : - in america the president ca n't dissolve parliament - in america the president ca n't make decrees with the force of law - in america the president ca n't select judges for the judiciary without confirmation from parliament - in america the president ca n't create states the opposite is now true in turkey . 
  there are no longer any meaningful checks on executive power there . 
  erdogan can now perform the role of a one man legislature and stuff the courts at will . 
  source please , comrade whatabout . 
   the senior official said monday that a drone operated by russians was flying over a hospital as victims of the attack were rushing to get treatment . 
  ** hours after the drone left , a russian-made fighter jet bombed the hospital in what american officials believe was an attempt to cover up the usage of chemical weapons . 
  **  the presence of the surveillance drone over the hospital could n't have been a coincidence , the senior u.s. official said , arguing that russia must have known the chemical weapons attack was coming and that victims were seeking treatment . 
   the official , who was n't authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity , did n't give precise timing for when the drone was in the area . 
  the official also did n't provide details for the military and intelligence information that form the basis of what the pentagon now believes . 
  he declared martial law in 1977 , and rescinded it in 1985 . 
  he died 3 years later in a airplane crash . 
  zia-ul-haq kept his country under martial law for 8 years while he pushed theocratic policies . 
  i wonder how long this will go on . 
  the franco-german alliance was clearly dead the day he was given some fish . 
  unbelievable !, 
  who would do that ? 
   california has a better chance at being an independent country than this happening , seems that way right now : http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article128316519.html, 
  yep . 
  and his call was n't surprising either . 
  besides his love of dictators and desires to be one himself , there 's also the fact that he has corrupt ties to the turkish regime : [ new york times -- michael flynn was paid to represent turkey 's interests during trump campaign ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/us/politics/michael-flynn-turkey.html?_r=0 ) [ chicago tribune -- ex-cia chief : michael flynn 's firm discussed removing turkish cleric from u.s. ] ( http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-michael-flynn-fethullah-gulen-20170325-story.html ) [ associated press -- former trump aide flynn says lobbying may have helped turkey ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/former-trump-security-adviser-flynn-admits-turkey-lobbying ) [ new york times -- michael flynn offers to testify before congress in exchange for immunity ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/politics/michael-flynn-congress-immunity-russia.html ) [ nbc news -- michael flynn 's immunity request rejected by senate intelligence committee ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-intelligence-committee-rejects-immunity-michael-flynn-n741061 ), 
  this is the smart thing to do . 
  unfortunately , people often are n't smart . 
  i 'm sure he 'll save them the yearly trip and let ~ 100 of them live there with him . 
  rent free of course . 
  he 's less than secretly jealous .
