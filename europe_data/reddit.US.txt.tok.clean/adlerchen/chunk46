  his call is n't surprising . 
  besides his love of dictators and desires to be one himself , there 's also the fact that he has corrupt ties to the turkish regime : [ new york times -- michael flynn was paid to represent turkey 's interests during trump campaign ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/us/politics/michael-flynn-turkey.html?_r=0 ) [ chicago tribune -- ex-cia chief : michael flynn 's firm discussed removing turkish cleric from u.s. ] ( http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-michael-flynn-fethullah-gulen-20170325-story.html ) [ associated press -- former trump aide flynn says lobbying may have helped turkey ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/former-trump-security-adviser-flynn-admits-turkey-lobbying ) [ new york times -- michael flynn offers to testify before congress in exchange for immunity ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/politics/michael-flynn-congress-immunity-russia.html ) [ nbc news -- michael flynn 's immunity request rejected by senate intelligence committee ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-intelligence-committee-rejects-immunity-michael-flynn-n741061 ), 
  no one tells him anything , and if they do he would n't listen anyway . 
  the state department would normally be drafting possible responses to arising situations and giving council , but they 've been mass fired and kept out the decision making processes for everything the last few months . 
  just ask a doctor who fan for theirs . 
  i 'm waiting for cnn to praise him on having such a `` presidential '' call . 
  yep . 
  agreed . 
  it 's reached the terminal stage . 
  it 's no longer possible to hold him accountable from within the system . 
  it has n't been since last year . 
  what parliament ? 
  they just extended the state of emergency yet again last night , and i believe that means the grand national assembly of turkey is still kept out of session . 
  when you people complain about muslim refugees bringing sharia law , we all know it 's actually just projection . 
  when if conforms to your world view anyway and when you trust the source of the information , you tend not to do much digging . 
   i want to hide my flair in shame i 'm not embarrassed to be american . 
  i 'm embarrassed for america . 
   from cnn turk - trump has called erdogan to congratulate him on the result . 
  no one should have expected otherwise : [ new york times -- michael flynn was paid to represent turkey 's interests during trump campaign ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/us/politics/michael-flynn-turkey.html?_r=0 ) [ chicago tribune -- ex-cia chief : michael flynn 's firm discussed removing turkish cleric from u.s. ] ( http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-michael-flynn-fethullah-gulen-20170325-story.html ) [ associated press -- former trump aide flynn says lobbying may have helped turkey ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/former-trump-security-adviser-flynn-admits-turkey-lobbying ) [ new york times -- michael flynn offers to testify before congress in exchange for immunity ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/politics/michael-flynn-congress-immunity-russia.html ) [ nbc news -- michael flynn 's immunity request rejected by senate intelligence committee ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-intelligence-committee-rejects-immunity-michael-flynn-n741061 ), 
  this is where they grow the legos , right ? 
  well , at least you 've got something good going on in your life right now , then . 
  humans do n't stop being humans . 
  not for anything . 
  also the username . 
   8 : * the followers must feel humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies . 
  * when i was a boy i was taught to think of englishmen as the five-meal people . 
  they ate more frequently than the poor but sober italians . 
  jews are rich and help each other through a secret web of mutual assistance . 
  however , the followers of ur-fascism must also be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies . 
  thus , by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus , the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak . 
  ** fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy . 
  ** -- umberto eco - `` eternal fascism : fourteen ways of looking at a blackshirt '', 
  correct . 
  they are guarded solely by american forces , and the host country for the nato nuke sharing program does n't get the launch codes unless article 5 is triggered for defense against a nuclear armed opponent . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hktleoc27-i ), 
  the bullies are always the most cowardly in the face of real danger . 
  that 's only an upside if you do n't believe in self determination and/or worse , you 're thinking about ethnic cleansing . 
  nothing about any of it is very democratic . 
  a vote with numerous voting irregularities is not legitimate . 
  what if he 's funding your toaster ? 
  not all of them made that bed . 
  it 's an opportunity to gather a list of all who voted where . 
  then they cross reference that with which polling stations reported how many no votes . 
  information gathering on individuals in a precinct with a high amount of no votes could then occur to help determine who probably voted no . 
  the id list gets narrowed down , and turned into a more general watch list . 
  maybe employment and educational opportunities will be undercut in the future . 
  maybe just outright arrest in the future if things get bad enough . 
  use your imagination . 
  with them , it 's always projection . 
  yep . 
  the moment they bring the death penalty back , is when the purging becomes lethal . 
  we 've been watching the train wreck for a while . 
  ever since their military was purged of the secular generals years ago . 
  it 's within that context that we knew what was coming . 
  is `` reis '' erdogan 's title now ? 
  what does '' \u00e7omar '' mean ? 
  i thought we were talking what an eu accession might be like for the hypothetical breakaway state pictured above . 
  because , i think that * that * turkey really would be given more than lip service over joining . 
  yes , but also means of possible voter intimidation were noted and documented as well . 
  that and the transparency issues should raise eye brows . 
  4th rome incoming . 
   sure , but the problem here was that the eu 's own rules were n't enforced . 
  that 's not a mark against the eu but the officials at the time . 
  failure to enforce is a structural problem , because it shows that meaningful oversight is lacking . 
  to disassociate the fact that eu regulators were n't doing their job from the eu as an institution , is just silly in my opinion . 
  the scandal should be setting off alarms about why it happened and how to prevent it in the future . 
  the relative inaction on the eu 's part to put in new safe guards should worry eu consumers , imo . 
  it 's only been two months so far . 
  do n't jump the gun quite yet . 
  any damage he does to the country as a whole is still going to effect us . 
  25 million of us could have been without healthcare again if not for a beneficial fluke of idiocy in the house . 
  yes it would disproportionately hurt his own voters , but it 's not like things wo n't effect us dissenters either . 
  all the sympathy on the sub has been directed at the secular turks so far , but i just wanted you to know that you kurds also have people rooting for you as well . 
  stay safe and strong . 
   corporations hate the eu . 
  microsoft hated it when it was beaten into submission by the eu , apple hated it when it was forced to pay its taxes and likewise thousands of companies have been attacked by the eu for forming cartels . 
  those are a few examples . 
  none the less , there are other instances where the eu is clearly acting in corporate interests over the people they represent . 
  for example , the greece bailout was really just a bailout for french and german banks , and the eu for years [ knowingly failed to enforce regulations on vw for their emissions fraud . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/volkswagen-how-officials-ignored-years-of-emissions-evidence-a-1108325.html ) the eu is very much lobbied by corporate interests , and while it does do some good work with their regulatory standards , it could still be doing a lot better imo . 
  [ le pen is beholden to russian banks . 
  ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-19/le-pen-party-taps-russian-banks-to-fund-2017-election-campaign ) because of her debts , they and the russian state will extract concessions from her , should she ever become president . 
  to think otherwise is purely naive . 
  the form of those concessions will likely be about ukraine , and you can see a glimpse of it [ here ] ( http://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2017/02/01/france-intv-amanpour-marine-le-pen-b.cnn ) as she denies that crimea was ever invaded by russia in the first place . 
   your idiocy oh look , psychological projection . 
  you people never change . 
  or it could go like the iran-iraq war , where the islamic revolution solidified only because the critics of the regime had to fall in line and form a united front . 
   nazis and us bad example . 
  you have neonazis doing divide and conquer right now . 
  they 're the ones who keep going on about terrorists so they can chip away at civil liberties . 
  to give a serious answer , start reading up on actual historical grassroots independence movements and start learning from their methodology . 
  just be discreet . 
  where your country is going , you probably do n't want it to be too easy to find out you have an intense interest in the subject . 
  i ca n't think of any successful independence movements that did n't displace people though , [ including ours ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_empire_loyalist ) . 
  yep . 
  divide and conquer is the only constant . 
  all these wannabe dictators use it . 
  all the political theater in the meantime is just for keeping fear high so they can get away with centralizing power . 
  this happens again and again , but somehow enough people keep falling for it . 
  the soviet union breaking up is a good counter point to that assertion .
