  considering the history of your country , i would n't be so quick to douse any talk of independence as unrealistic . 
  :p it 's rarely easy , but it 's never impossible . 
  and besides , it 's a good coping mechanism for them . 
   well putin is polling at 80 percent [ case and point ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/world/europe/fraudulent-votes-for-putin-abound-in-chechnya.html )  kim jong un is polling at a respectable 112 percent the great leader was born on the holy mountain of paektu , and therefore actually commands 127 % of the proletariat vote . 
  still down from his grandfather , however . 
  i ca n't find the specific threads i was thinking about , but here are a few similar ones : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4uctqa/lets_draw_namerica_from_memory/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rpqbs/about_a_week_ago_there_was_a_post_about_how/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rk7r2/americans_try_to_place_european_countries_on_a_map/, 
   and some states even have their own defense forces . 
  i did n't think that there were any states that did n't have their own national guard ? 
   there is literally nothing stopping an american state from creating their own space agency and putting a man on the moon . 
  they indeed have that level of sovereignty . 
  yup . 
  our governor was recently talking about starting a space program . 
  years back there was a side by contest on this sub using blank maps for both america and europe . 
  the results were hilarious . 
  i 'd love to see it be resurrected . 
  as if more than 0.1 % of us know that country ever existed . 
  corrupt thatcherite , loony communist , russian puppet neonazi , or boring liberal . 
  i wonder if they 'll fuck it up too . 
  the safe but boring choice seems to be unpopular time and time again ... 
  well at least they 're not emboldened enough to dispense with the lip service * yet * . 
  the people who are in immediate danger still need to flee however . 
  when flynn resigned , it was one of only three times in the past few months that i felt that anything was normal and things were working like they should be . 
  i miss the boring days that would drag on to boring weeks which would drag on to boring months . 
  i propose `` best turkey '' . 
   rebuild the roman walls of constantinople finally a wall building program i can get behind . 
  a completely rebuilt wall would be such a cool addition for the already epic tourist circuit in the city . 
  you 're not the only one . 
  i 'm from la. 
   oh and nato membership would be nice . 
  a guarenteedly secular and stably and robustly democratic turkey would also have a * real * shot at eu membership too . 
  the side that keeps the dardanelles and bosphorus is the one that keeps nato membership . 
  the shared values would just be a sweetener on the deal . 
  you got ta try anchovy and pineapple pizza sometime . 
  it 's the perfect combination of sweet and salty . 
  this guy knows how to pizza . 
  i thought that was iceland with their geothermal plants , provided they keep making the necessary blood sacrifices to the magma elves . 
  you got ta cross post that to / r/turkey . 
  founding father of the country , basically . 
  he saved it from being carved up by greece , italy , france , and britain after wwi . 
  after that he embarked on a large number of reforms that made the turkish republic what it was . 
  this is why history is such an important subject . 
  the lessons it can teach are profound and extremely important . 
  those who fail to learn from it , are doomed to repeat it , as the saying goes . 
  no one ever does . 
  i say prepare for worst but hope for the best . 
  all anyone can ever do is try to make a difference and resist being discouraged into inaction . 
  it must all be doubly painful for you .

  he ai n't helping or saving democracy any fucking where . 
  it 's amazing how many people still seem to think that any of what 's happening over there can possibly be being done in good faith . 
   the hero of a david lodge novel says that you do n't know , when you make love for the last time , that you are making love for the last time . 
  voting is like that . 
  some of the germans who voted for the nazi party in 1932 no doubt understood that this might be the last meaningfully free election for some time , but most did not . 
  some of the czechs and slovaks who voted for the czechoslovak communist party in 1946 probably realized that they were voting for the end of democracy , but most assumed they would have another chance . 
  no doubt the russians who voted in 1990 did not think that this would be the last free and fair election in their country 's history , which ( thus far ) it has been . 
  any election can be the last , or at least the last in the lifetime of the person casting the vote . 
  the nazis remained in power until they lost a world war in 1945 , the czechoslovak communists until their system collapsed in 1989 . 
  the russian oligarchy established after the 1990 elections continues to function , and promotes a foreign policy designed to destroy democracy elsewhere . 
  -- timothy snyder - `` on tyranny : twenty lessons from the twentieth century '', 
  ca n't tell if american , turkish , or both ... :p, 
  of course . 
  but the fact remains , democracy should n't be blamed for someone reaching an office with less votes . 
  that 's fundamentally not democracy . 
  i have n't lost a single ounce of my own faith in humanity or democracy . 
  if anything , i hunger for it because our system of governance is clearly broken because it 's not democratic enough . 
  people keeping their heads down low will only make it worse . 
  an authoritarian state can only exist with the complacence of the people . 
  the less the authoritarians are resisted , the quicker they consolidate and monopolize power . 
  if any of them ca n't be brave , and it can be very hard to be brave in that situation , then at the very least they have to be kind . 
  things are going to get worse before they get better over there . 
  there will be a lot of needless suffering . 
  all fights are won on the inside , unless you 're fantasizing about some bay of pigs scenario . 
  any turk who fears for themselves or their loved ones immediately should leave . 
  everyone else should begin organizing and militarizing . 
  the time when they could rely on the courts has passed . 
  that 's an awfully intimate prize . 
  flirting while drunk , mayhaps ? 
  for now . 
  it will get worse , but it can also get better further down the road . 
  there 's always a future . 
  you ca n't lose sight of that , even if you find it very hard to think that way right now . 
  erdogan will inevitably die , and his legacy will inevitably vanish . 
  it 's up to you and millions more like you to begin trying to make the best future you possibly can . 
   with trump , brexit and this election i beginning to losing faith in democracy & humanity , trump got 3 million less votes . 
  i reject the notion that democracy is at fault for him , when it 's the lack of it that allowed for him to take office . 
  you do n't have much historical knowledge , do you ? 
  this is what a backsliding democracy looks like . 
  this is n't unique . 
  need is different than should . 
  other than international treaties stopping it , most people do n't need any legal citizenship . 
  the question of citizenship should only be about if the individuals have settled into * your * society , i believe . 
  how they vote in another country , i think , should n't have bearing on that fundamental question . 
  are they citizens of your country in the societal sense ? 
  do they follow the law ? 
  do they or would they contribute to the common good ? 
  is n't that why they purged the judges under martial law ? 
  who would dare to even hear the case now ? 
   yeah but going full blown apartheid is different from what erdogan is doing , unless he 's sending people to the gulags there 's really very little basis to do anything . 
  gulags are nearing in on the horizon . 
  not literally labor camps necessarily , but the country still has purged 80,000 people from key roles , and now there 's talk of bringing the death penalty back ... mass murder of dissidents is a very real future possibility quickly becoming manifest .
