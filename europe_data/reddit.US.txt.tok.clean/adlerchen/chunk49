  it 's produced a caucus in congress incapable of compromise on any issue what so ever . 
  it 's a derogatory slur for the diehard fanatical supporters . 
  it comes from the red `` make america great again '' baseball hats they wear . 
   i 'd also bet on them coming before may 1st . 
  what makes you say this ? 
  i 'd like to believe that consequence will be coming soon if at all , but i 'm quite pessimistic about it . 
  you 're the one with no understanding of anything . 
  you 're stupidly conflating a deciding popular vote with an end to constitutional rule of law and an end to representative democracy . 
  we can have an electoral system where people get to vote directly on their candidates , instead of voting for an unfair and arbitrary amount of other people to probably but not guaranteedly vote on their behalf for their president , and also not have popular referendums where people get to vote on other people 's rights !, 
  real tyranny is when people 's votes are n't equal . 
  i never said a damn thing about undoing what can be voted on or not . 
  i think we 're getting the 10 % of afd voters and older people from west berlin and west germany who remember when our country was n't the complete laughing stock that it deservedly is right now . 
  ca n't a formerly devoted husband be forgiven for a little mid life crisis in an otherwise bland and productive marriage ? 
  \\ ^ \\ ^ \\ ^ a red hat . 
  people tend to react to problems only when they happen . 
  not so much when they are still on the horizon but have n't come to pass yet . 
  i think that 's just basic human nature . 
  no nuclear weapons , 143 million vs. 61 million . 
  it really could n't . 
  1 year old account , only 3 comments , the first being from today . 
  verdict : shill or troll account . 
  do n't worry , that 's because voters are still in the honeymoon phase with the 115th congress . 
  it 's dropping now from it 's high in february of 28 % approval . 
  now some polls are showing only 20 % . 
  by the end of the year it 'll probably be back to single digits again ... 
   we have popular vote within the states but to avoid enormous states dominating the rest we have an electoral college at the federal level . 
  that 's the asinine excuse that 's always given for why we should n't change the system , but it 's not the reality of the situation . 
  in truth it 's a minority of the population dominating the majority , and using that unjust power to deny meaningful reform that would benefit the majority . 
  twice now in one lifetime we 've had presidents with less votes in our co called `` democracy '' . 
  americans should have equal votes . 
  it should n't matter where we are when we cast them . 
  it 's nothing short of tyranny . 
  this is a recipe for civil war , and if things do n't change soon , i fucking hope it happens . 
   a lower court has accepted a kind of mathematical test to determine how fair or unfair a district is . 
  if the supreme court affirms it , it could create one of the biggest changes in our elections since the voting rights act , not to be overly pessimistic , but it was the robbert 's court that gutted many protections in the voting rights act , and with gorsuch being installed in a stolen seat , there 's little reason to hope for change on the front of ending gerrymandering and voter suppression . 
  also , i 'd like to recommend [ this book ] ( http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=1436ce79af47c674b8d817ad740028e1 ) while we 're on the subject of gerrymandering . 
  i consider it a must read . 
   i mean as an outsider it is funny to look at maps of gerrymandered districts that look like some kind of art but in the us there are people actively being robbed of their vote that way . 
  absolutely not nice . 
  as an insider , it 's not funny to me . 
  :( also , i 'd like to recommend [ this book ] ( http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=1436ce79af47c674b8d817ad740028e1 ) on the subject to you . 
  changing the electoral system requires constitutional changes , and that is incredibly hard to do . 
  there are only two ways to do so : 1 ) a constitutional amendment submitted by congress : there have only been 17 amendments passed since the bill of rights ( the first 10 amendments of the 27 ) . 
  it requires 66 % of the vote in both cameras of congress and for 38 states ( 66 % of the states , currently 50 ) to pass the amendment bill afterwords . 
  2 ) a constitutional convention : has n't been done since 1787 . 
  under the current constitution , it would require 34 states to formally call for one . 
  [ there is kinda a patch in the works ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_popular_vote_interstate_compact ) though , that might happen in the future , although it wo n't address the larger systemic and structural problems . 
  actually , it was your country that declared war on mine in late 1941 . 
  the war lasted until 1945 , so that would be 3.5 years of my country being in the war . 
  there is no reason for anyone to call my country `` cowardly '' . 
  we tried to stay neutral . 
  we betrayed no one , as we had mutual defense treaties with either the uk or france . 
  but please , try to pin more shit about wwii on my country , when it was 100 % your country 's , italy 's , japan 's , and the soviet union 's fault that it ever happened . 
  dark money is already on my reading list . 
  i 'll get around to it eventually . 
   a few books i 'd recommend back to you are [ it 's even worse than it looks ] ( http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=8b748b7d4f2b8133e6c923c2c79ce5d2 ) and [ ratfucked ] ( http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=1436ce79af47c674b8d817ad740028e1 ) . 
  i 'm guessing those twitter republicans includes john schindler ? 
  yes . 
  wide autonomy is given to the states . 
  in fact , they are sole authorities over any subject not * explicitly * granted to the federal government in the constitution . 
  the federal government is granted all kinds of competencies , but if one is not granted than the states get to decide for themselves what they do . 
  [ a majority of states can even blow up the whole system if they want to . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_to_propose_amendments_to_the_united_states_constitution ), 
  i suppose that 's fair . 
  i just looked at the numbers over on ballotpedia . 
  it 's worth mentioning that the republican turnout was far worse however ( 166,998 in 2016 vs. 63,505 in 2017 ) . 
  i wonder what historical data would show for special elections and midterms in that district going back a ways . 
  anyway , here 's the links if you want to peruse it yourself : https://ballotpedia.org/kansas%27_4th_congressional_district_election,_2016 https://ballotpedia.org/kansas%27_4th_congressional_district_special_election,_2017, 
  have you read david frum 's [ how to build an autocracy ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/03/how-to-build-an-autocracy/513872/ ) yet ? 
  i feel it 's a must read for understanding how one possible future where the us actually does descend into authoritarianism can happen given the current state of law , the sociology at play , and the likely and publicly known intents of the relevant actors . 
  if you do n't know , frum was one george bush ii 's speech writers , and so i think his concerns over narrative building and control should be especially listened to . 
   you ca n't simply hope . 
  the party has to appeal to people who actually vote . 
  that 's a bit of a self fulfilling prophesy . 
  if you do n't appeal to people , why would they vote for you ? 
  i think it 's smarter to cast as wide of a net as a you can . 
   as for gerrymandering dissuading voters , why did democrats lose most of the close districts then in 2016 ? 
  i 'm not a statistician , but i 'd be willing to bet it 's a lot of factors and not * solely * because of a depressed youth vote . 
  i think we 're starting to . 
  [ in a recent special election , a district in kansas that went +27 for trump in 2016 only went +7 for estes in 2017 . 
  ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/us/politics/kansas-special-election.html ) a 20 % shift in result is very impressive , even with understanding that part of the result was due to blowback over the governor and his policies , which trump was n't effected by because he was seen as an `` outsider '' . 
  we 'll see if this holds for georgia 's and montana 's special elections this year as well , but i 'm a little hopeful that the youth vote will start chipping away at the republican edge now that every millennial is finally of voting age and now quite agitated . 
  presuming the elections are free and fair , 2018 and 2020 may well push the pendulum back . 
  yes , but it 's worth mentioning that that 's because a lot of people who can vote are choosing not to because they are convinced that there is not point , because of said gerrymandering . 
  and even popular vote aside , the amount of seats won by the gop is proportionately grossly out of step with the popular vote results because again , of the gerrymandering . 
  2020 is the next census year , and that 's when the allotted districts will be redrawn , so we 'll just have to hope that people do show up that year . 
  but as we get older , we will be voting more and more , and i hope it will show . 
  the democrats just need better pr . 
  i think a lot of younger people who have left leaning sentiments still fully understand the issues and what the dems stand for . 
  \\ ^ \\ ^ \\ ^ a red hat . 
  most of us are understanding and agreeing actually , if you look more carefully . 
   ( and in all fairness democrats have ostracised social conservatives from the party ) . 
  had to be done . 
  civil rights and affordable health care should be non negotiable . 
  the democrats chose to embrace the values of the younger generation , and that was n't a mistake . 
   this is news to me , i did n't know gary johnson is an agent of the elite . 
  all libertarians are , whether they realize it or not . 
  deregulation is coveted by the moneyed interests precisely because it allows them to better exploit the poor for their own benefit . 
  ayn rand 's world view , which was informed by her upbringing in the soviet union , has no meaningful application to the modern united states , where it 's the corporations that are running around unchecked with all the power , and not a totalitarian government . 
  more obscene capitalism will not help americans , when the capitalism we have is what is hurting them .
