i just went back and checked , it was indeed 2008 . 
  the ships were really a treat for me , i got some great photos . 
  and having that one street shut down for pedestrian traffic only ( if i remember correctly that is , i ca n't remember it 's name ) made it really nice for a walking tourist . 
  edit : went back and found one of the shots - [ kaliningrad ] ( http://img05.deviantart.net/1290/i/2008/212/2/e/102_by_jahphoto.jpg ) , at least i think that 's the ships name . 
  the news would be a lot funnier if they always referred to putin as `` the russian supervillan '', 
  there were less tensions when i visited , but i went in 08 and it was a great trip . 
  i walked around the touristy part of the city from 11pm to 5am with a ton of expensive camera gear and was never given any trouble . 
  i went to st. petersburg back 8ish years ago , and by coincidence was there during navy day , it was awesome . 
  what 's lovely is every trump supporter i 've talked to so far is completely ignorant and shocked to learn of his stance on climate change . 
  smh . 
  got any room in finland ? 
  yeah but trump is n't a government employee or elected official . 
  anyone can run for president and say stupid things if they want . 
  on the other hand , i 'd expect embassy officials to try to maintain some sense of professionalism . 
  wow the russian embassy account looks like an angsty pre-teen . 
  it 's so weird to see something that some people would call `` an authority '' acting like a child . . * on purpose * . 
  yep, 
  in the same picture you have alaska , which is the northernmost , easternmost , and westernmost us state . 
  apparently everyone has cool hats except germany , sweden , and china ... 
  they 're the land based version of our supercarrier fleet , basically . 
  vatican city with ambitions . 
   lets talk about usage for 200mph please ... why ? 
  are we going to use 200mph as the new standard for mileage ? 
  most cars ca n't even go that fast , how is it a useful statistic for this conversation ? 
  seriously , please explain . 
  that site is taking f-450 based motor homes and commercial vehicles in to account so it 's not really relevant . 
  naturally motor homes and box trucks get horrible mileage . 
  you should pay attention to your sources if you 're going to use them to try to prove a point ... and yeah , it is pretty bad mileage even on the standard truck , but a f-450 is pretty close to the `` worst case scenario '' for mileage . 
  practically every other consumer vehicle does better than that . 
  it 's a truck designed for hard work and practically nothing else . 
  i picked it as an example because it 's mileage is so bad . 
  my * point * was that 40 l/100km is a number you pulled out of your ass . 
  i 'll ask again since you did not answer before : if one of the largest trucks gets significantly better mileage than that , what car were you talking about when you came up with that number ? 
  f-450 based motor homes even beat that . 
   40 l/100km lol what fucking car are you even talking about ? 
  that 's 5.8 mpg for anyone wondering ; even my fathers massive f-450 truck gets about triple that and it 's considered to be bad on mileage . 
  i 'm pretty sure the only us consumer cars that get that kind of mileage are supercars , and europe makes plenty off gas guzzling supercars too . 
  in fact europe makes a lot * more * of them . 
  that 's not even considering telsa motors is a us company . . 
   i am not saying the average american is dumb . 
  ****  i never said that this was true to all americans nor do i think it is . 
  uhhh  americans are very arrogant . 
  you did n't qualify that with `` some '' or even `` the average '' . 
  you , with a blanket statement , called all americans very arrogant . 
   they insist that america is the greatest country in the world when they could n't even name 15 others . 
  again , no qualifiers , still talking about all americans . 
   do n't treat me like an idiot . 
  i can only assume you are doing exactly that since you 're acting like i 've already forgotten things you said that i can easily scroll up and see . 
   americans are very arrogant know what else is arrogant ? 
  calling 300,000,000 people arrogant like you know them all . 
  i actually fail to think of anything that could possibly be more arrogant than thinking you know the intelligence of an entire country . 
  honestly , you seem stupider than the average american i meet on a day to day basis if you 're willing to assert such wild stereotypes as fact . 
   that said , 15 is obviously an overexaggeration , but i do n't think 30 would be . 
  you 're literally just making up shit and asserting it as truth based off your own personal experience . 
  also over exaggeration is two words . 
  on top of that you just looked at data 3 years old and said it reflects the situation `` right now '' . 
  please move so you stop dragging down our average iq . 
   and my point that is that it 's clearly more than just race . 
  nobody is * saying * it 's just race . 
  again and again they say `` other factor ** s ** '' . 
  when the us homicide rate is brought up the first thing usually said is something about gun laws . 
  that 's exactly what the comment that started this chain is saying . 
  nobody is denying that there 's * many * factors here . 
  it would be insane to think that a difference in homicide rate between countries could be attributed to just one thing . 
  you 're trying to say it 's not just race . 
  they 're trying to say it 's not just guns . 
  you 're both right . 
  it 's a cool concept , it just always seemed like there are plenty of * other * places to put solar panels where you do n't have to deal with things driving over them . 
  but less is green , and green means good . 
  i do n't think you understand . 
  no problem we will just tap your elected officials phones lines . . or . . wait . . that 's what you wanted , right ? 
  well it 's nice to see the nsa do something useful . . 
  oh my god my sides they hurt please do n't say such funny things . 
  wow that 's just . . pathetic . 
  i ca n't think of any other words to describe it . 
  i wonder if these people believe their own propaganda . 
  it turns out a lot of us actually enjoy being insured . 
  weird . 
   hitler might have made it into paris but he was n't welcome . 
  damn straight . 
  hitler could force a provisional government to surrender , but he could not force the people to , and the people of france never gave up . 
  no i do n't , and i feel like a lesser person because of it . 
   it means you have a voice , no matter how small you are . 
  ehhhh ... if `` you '' is a state , yes . 
  if `` you '' is an individual american , no . 
  my state always votes the opposite way i do by a wide margin . 
  to me this feels like my vote does not count . 
  while i still do it every election , there is little reason for me to get out and vote . 
  if it was pure popular vote , i would not have a reason to feel that way . 
  personally , i am against a system that could allow someone to become president with less than 25 % of the popular vote , or where electors can * technically * vote differently than how their state `` instructed '' them to vote . 
  it 's a relic of an age where information traveled by horseback . 
  in theory it should make presidential candidates care about small states , but they do n't . 
  they almost never campaign in sparsely populated states , and when they do it 's because there 's a densely populated one right next to it . 
  they spend most of their time campaigning in the swing states because that makes the most sense . 
  if there was no electoral college , there would be no swing states for them to spend all their time trying to woo . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wc42hgla4k ) explains how i feel pretty accurately . 
   the country which has been called cowards by the english and the americans only ignorant americans . 
  true patriots know france is our oldest [ ally ] ( http://www.americasfreedomfighters.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/french.jpg ) that was [ instrumental ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/gilbert_du_motier_marquis_de_lafayette.png ) in securing our [ freedom ] ( https://www.statuecruises.com/images/hsc-homepageimage.jpg ) and still [ supports us in time of need ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wk9f57d.jpg ) .
