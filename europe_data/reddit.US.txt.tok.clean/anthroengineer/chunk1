soon the us will be lead by a woman exactly like that . 
  that does n't include puerto rico or other american territories . 
  the us has unrestricted movement between states within its own borders . 
  the poorest american states make 1/5th the gdp per capita than the richest states . 
  legalization in the usa has also dramatically decreased drug cartel violence . 
  i do n't see why pragmatic lawmakers would n't want to legalize marijuana at this point . 
  that is debateable . 
  90 % of punk bands play one song with different lyrics . 
  i 'll take a hipster smelling like rosemary/lemon over a crust punk smelling of ass/feet/armpits any day . 
  the only way to bring them down is to never keep fighting . 
  people in power will always be assholes , it is our responsibility as citizens to make sure they do n't get out of hand . 
  what social change did punks bring about ? 
  seems to me they railed against the system and the man for decades w / bad music and nothing came of it . 
  at least hipsters create more bike infrastructure . 
  isis has tons of electronic records as a fledgling state , and intelligence agencies keep getting more and more of them as the war goes on . 
  those anti-missile systems might sorta work . 
  they do some of the air force training for possible eastern europe/russia missions here in oregon . 
  i just blacklist sites that do this . 
  i add them to my hosts file . 
  less regulation of what `` chocolate '' is . 
  ignorant europeans use political pejoratives yet have no idea what the words actually mean . 
  i guess that is why the eu is more broken than the us . 
  you ca n't even communicate basic concepts to each other . 
  but i am not wrong , show me a single * regressive * leftist who does hero worship of stalin . 
  just one . 
  does n't change the fact that hero worship is n't part of the regressive left in any nation on the planet . 
  you europeans are so cute when you are wrong . 
  hero worship is part of authoritarianism , not regressiveness . 
  this also is n't about ontology , but nomenclature . 
  it is left wing authoritarianism . 
  nato does n't have to back the aggressor in a conflict . 
  russia has been bleeding engineering talent for almost two decades . 
  their fabs are two-three generations behind the times . 
  it really goes to the heart of modern warfare . 
  when russia is having to use commercial off the shelf ic then it is beholden to the industrial capacity of other nations , and therefore can not wage modern war for any significant amount of time . 
  ic is in everything now . 
  integrated circuits . 
  sorry , engineer here . 
  germany alone has something like 20x the industrial capacity of russia . 
  russia has almost no native integrated circuit ( ic ) fabrication for instance . 
  ireland has more ic fab ability than all of russia . 
  ussr also ran out of money by having things like 100 's of military bases in the subarctic to maintain . 
  they closed like 90 % of the most expensive ones after the fall of the ussr . 
  he is a [ dominionist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominion_theology ) . 
   dominionists celebrate christian nationalism , in that they believe that the united states once was , and should once again be , a christian nation . 
  in this way , they deny the enlightenment roots of american democracy . 
  dominionists promote religious supremacy , insofar as they generally do not respect the equality of other religions , or even other versions of christianity . 
  dominionists endorse theocratic visions , insofar as they believe that the ten commandments , or `` biblical law , '' should be the foundation of american law , and that the u.s. constitution should be seen as a vehicle for implementing biblical principles . 
  poland ? 
  ted cruz just won iowa and his supporters overwhelmingly are fundamentalists who believe the king james bible is the word of god . 
  that is sadly what happens in any area with stagnant or retracting economies , religion is sought out as a magical curative for personal and social problems . 
  the worse the economy the more radical the religion . 
  which is why the best way to fight religious extremism is through economic growth . 
  except russia still has no modern ic fabrication , which is a major , major part of modernization . 
  they are still outsourcing vital defense systems to places like china . 
  russia ca n't hold unto its engineers and scientists , they have been steadily leaving for decades now . 
  the us has a tank production plant [ the size of a city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lima_army_tank_plant ) that they are getting ready to mothball , does the uk have mothballed facilities they can just bring online ?

  goodbye and thanks for all the gefilte fish !, 
  there are millions of cloud services now . 
  this law is utterly unenforceable . 
  [ ms zee 's analysis is blistering : these courts all treat women as less than equal and are incompatible with human rights law .

  -- william blake, 
  contracts like marriages , which can involve children , have no place in religious courts . 
  also do n't generalize it makes you look ignorant . 
  fuck that , all civil arbitration should be in public and in front of the state . 
  sweden has [ less meetup groups ] ( http://sweden.meetup.com/ ) in their entire country [ than budapest alone ] ( http://www.meetup.com/cities/hu/budapest/ ) . 
  that being said if you want to meet people to talk about stuff beyond chit-chat that is a great way to do it . 
  mexico has gone from a nation of almost universal illiteracy in the middle of the 20th century to almost universal literacy in four generations . 
  i think they are doing pretty well . 
  is that the tunnels on hoth from empires strike back ? 
  same thing happened in venezuela . 
  no semiconductor forest either . 
  whole planet is experiencing climate change . 
  it rained here in oregon for almost 30 days straight . 
  this is n't like germany or japan or russia after ww ii . 
  the civil engineers who would be rebuilding syria are all gone . 
  dead or they have escaped to europe . 
  rebuilding syria as it once was will take generations . 
  do n't forget the new crop of arab upstarts trying to make a caliphate or something . 
  soviet technical difficulties can be rather terrifying . 
  how many died testing the gum ? 
  english has up to triple word modifiers with dashes , are the em dashes unique to english ?

  reopen [ devil 's island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devil%27s_island ) . 
  also people bringing in their own drinks and food . 
  send all your refugees to northern ireland . 
  problem solved . 
  i feel so sorry for the french today . 
  ireland should build a tunnel to scotland . 
  [ not every country can make a lot of jet fuel . 
  ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?product=jet-fuel&amp;graph=production&amp;display=rank ) military planes eat up a lot of it , and most countries only have enough for domestic consumption for airlines , few export it besides the united states , korea , russia , and japan which represent about 80 % of the world 's jet fuel refining capacity . 
  can turkey make enough jet fuel ? 
  do they have the refining capacity ? 
  we need ground drones .
