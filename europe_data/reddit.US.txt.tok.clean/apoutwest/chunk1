ahhh romania , you 're so great . 
  seriously , i love you guys , just cool people . 
   silly and harmless fun . 
  well that 's kind of the problem is n't it ? 
  he 's saying `` i want to understand the feelings of refugees , washed overboard while crossing the mediterranean '' and so he decides to go to a water park ? 
  ( i know he did n't really go to a water park , but might as well be the case ) . 
  `` i have discovered that the splashathon 3000 is mega fun and refugees really should n't be complaining '' . 
  the whole thing is just tone deaf to the extreme , you are n't experiencing what a person washed overboard at night with no certainty of rescue is experiencing . 
  so do n't play like you are , it 's not a game . 
  before i get shouted at for being pro-refugee or anti-refugee , i 'm not making a statement either way . 
  it just comes across as totally ridiculous to try to * empathize * with the refugees in such a meaningless and silly way . 
  it 's like claiming to understand a soldier 's ptsd because you played a few rounds of paintball . 
   americans identify by their ethnicity a huge number of americans do n't have a clue about , or care about their ethnic identity . 
  even the ones who do identify by their ethnic identity are mostly full of shit . 
  they just pick some ethnic origin they like and they decide that is their identity . 
  never mind that you 're only like 1/10th irish . 
  european descended americans mostly do n't have a clue , and mostly do n't care . 
  most important lesson , never trust a spaniard . 
  i might be able to enlighten the issue . 
  in america at least , just being an american is boring . 
  a certain class of attention seeker ( usually young and liberal ) does n't like to admit that they 're just a boring old american like everyone else . 
  they are `` spanish '' or `` italian '' never mind your valley girl accent and the fact that you 've lived in fucking florida your whole life . 
  instead they like to play up and exaggerate their `` cultural heritage '' . 
  they are n't americans they are former soviet bla bla bla . 
  and they like to talk shit about america and the west while hugely benefitting from everything it provides them . 
  but it is n't really about the ideology it 's about being `` special '' and `` different '' from the majority of society . 
  comments like this makes me honestly think we 're going to see another mass genocide in europe before the century is out . 
  oh so now bosniak muslims are `` affiliates '' of the 9/11 hijackers ? 
  as an american and a new yorker that is some grade a bullshit . 
  well its less a problem these days , monopoly money is worth more than the loonie ( exchange rate burrrrnnnnnn ) . 
  i guarantee you that while the incident was worrying in the ** geopolitical sense ** . 
  the actual rank and file , the people on the ship , were having a great time . 
  mostly sailors get to do a whole lot of nothing , being buzzed by russian fighters was probably a fun and exciting change of pace . 
  yeah , it 's surprisingly annoying to transition between the two . 
  fair point , still hate coins . 
  just ca n't transition to thinking of the coins in my pocket as being worth more than about a $ 1.50 ( tops ) . 
  i think i lose about 10 bucks in change every time i visit europe / canada because of this . 
  shut up . 
   my eagle is wearing a fez , please send help . 
  fez is red , white , and blue , i see no problem here , stylin . 
  dude we get it . 
  wish in one hand shit in the other and tell me which one weighs more . 
  god fucking damnit , you people and your high value coins . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with countries with their own problems criticizing the us . 
  it 's annoying when criticism of the us is used to deflect from internal failings . 
  but i think it 's perfectly reasonable for another country to say `` we find these things about the us system to be reprehensible '' . 
  in fact i think it 's a good thing for other nations to criticize things like our shit prison system . 
  by having laws on the book like this , and by allowing court cases like this to go forward . 
  germany and other european nations with wishy washy free speech laws are lending tacit support to dictators and despots . 
  these people can prosecute their citizens and when they 're criticized they can point to western nations like germany and say `` hey , they do it too , i am no despot '' . 
  shameful . 
  did anyone else notice the guy who found like a toddler in the road , and just like carried it out of the road and set it down ? 
  it 's a toddler , not a turtle , or a frog , you ca n't just put it on the side . 
  that does n't fulfill your obligation . 
   being a politician is an honest job cough , cough , spews milk out nose , cough . 
  i was n't interpreting it as an attack i was wondering if people understood that it 's a joke . 
  also i think it 's worth pointing out that americans love shitty / trashy situations and we will actively seek them out . 
  have you ever noticed how american slang often redefines negative words as positives ? 
  examples : sick , disgusting , weak , dirty , wicked , all words with a negative connotation that in many circumstances are used to express approval . 
  the much beloved new york city has nick names along the lines of `` the gritty city '' , `` gotham '' ( city of fools ) , and `` new york shitty '' . 
  to many americans complaining is like another form of a complement . 
  the only truly thing which is awful to most americans is to be boring . 
  i mean i would say exaggeration is a typical element of comedy from all over the world . 
  but there are so many posts in this thread basically saying `` that does n't sound right , i do n't think it was that bad '' . 
  to be fair it seems like most people understand but it 's weird seeing people try to explain the accuracy ( or inaccuracy ) of what is obviously a joke . 
   did you see me mumble ? 
  uhhhhh , no ? 
  literally worse than hitler . 
  ** what time is it !!, 
  by virtue of having eyes i can tell you right now that geert wilder keeps mi6 agents locked in his basement . 
  and that any day now he 'll be sailing his personal submarine out of his volcano fortress to threaten all the world with nuclear annihilation . 
  just a heads up , take it or leave it . 
  before taking him out back and putting a 9mm between his eyes ? 
  uhh oh , someone 's got some sand in their vagina . 
  i 'm honestly confused , do you guys seriously not understand that the guy is doing a bit ? 
  he 's telling a prolonged joke and he 's using exaggeration , this is a typical element of american comedy . 
  he * probably * does n't actually think the ferry is the 9th circle of hell , he probably was n't actually planning to jump over the side . 
  he got on a ferry , things were a bit wacky , he was bored and had probably had a few drinks so he just started making posts . 
  he 's joking , this is comedic exaggeration , if you 're parsing the guys posts for accuracy you 're missing the point . 
   the us being the ultimate arbitrators of which country deserves their territorial integrity and which do n't is an unworkable framework . 
  works for me , have you tried turning it on and off again ? 
  but it 's kind of bad form to act like your room mate is the only one who does it . 
  well , where am i supposed to put all the stuff i get delivered from amazon ? 
  prime , free one day delivery , inflatable hot tub , are you seriously telling me you ** do n't ** want that ?!?!, 
  * fyi , i 'm joking , it takes four days for them to deliver a hot tub , one day , pfft , this ai n't narnia *, 
  i 've never lectured a european ( in person ) about my perceived failings of their society . 
  but on a regular basis ( my work puts me in contact with a lot of internationals ) i get the `` this is what we do in france , we think you americans are * crazy * '' . 
  this is n't an isolated one off , so many western europeans seem utterly convinced that we need them to educate us on how to run our society . 
  it 's annoying , easterners do n't have the chip on their shoulder , they 're way less annoying . 
  ultimately freedom is an individual decision , it can not be imposed upon you . 
  society must protect people even if they choose to go against the will of their family . 
  but being ostracized from the family in order to achieve personal freedom is a sacrifice sometimes required , and not just by muslims . 
  if you are gay that can lead to being ostracized in many western cultures ( including my own ) . 
  i 'm an atheist , do n't like islam , do n't like the veil , but you can not dictate freedom . 
  you can only show people the way and offer them the opportunity if they want it . 
   frankly , the `` american mentality '' does n't matter whatsoever . 
  nato nations legally have to comply with article 5 . 
  not law , treaty , we are bound by treaty . 
  and at the end of the day it absolutely does matter , if the american people decide `` fuck the treaty , what have they ever done for us ? '', 
  the treaty is dead , full stop .
