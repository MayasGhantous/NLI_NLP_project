  no nation on earth can force the united states to make an investment in the defense of others if we do n't want to make that investment . 
  dead americans will go a long long way to convincing the vast majority of the american populace that we are willing and able to make that investment . 
   who gives a fuck if the american population support a war ? 
  see vietnam , a war which was in every practical sense being `` won '' but since support for the war was so weak , political pressure ultimately caused a withdrawal . 
  american public support ( or lack there of ) makes an enormous difference to the u.s. government 's ability to successfully prosecute a long duration conflict . 
  in fact the american public 's unwillingness to make enormous sacrifices to win wars is arguably our greatest military weakness . 
  we are incredibly casualty averse . 
   the us simply can not afford to lose nato , the u.s. actually can afford to lose nato , we are more than capable of defending ourselves and our interests without the aid of any other nation . 
  it is countries that can not defend themselves that actually can not afford to lose nato . 
   and if no other nation responds ( which they 're highly likely to ) , the us is sure to respond to save their influence in europe . 
  if no other nation responds nato would be dead . 
  the u.s. might want nato ( not need ) but it is not something which can unilaterally be maintained . 
  it relies on at least some investment by all member nations . 
  if that involvement fails nato is dead regardless of american unilateral action or lack there of . 
  the point is that 100 dead u.s. troops mean that every american on earth will be howling for blood . 
  pearl harbor resulted in the deaths of only 2,403 american soldiers , and 68 civilians . 
  in response we nuked two cities and burned all of the rest to the ground . 
  you do n't understand the american mentality ** at all ** if you can not grasp just how insanely touchy , emotional , and unforgiving ( in the heat of the moment ) , we are . 
  it 's not about the ability of 100 troops to fight the russians , it 's about the fact that if you kill 100 american troops the whole of american society liberal / conservative / hippie and gun nut will demand retaliation on a massive scale . 
  eastern europeans also lack the smug sense of superiority that seems to permeate nw europe / scandinavia and the lowlands . 
  but hey maybe some people enjoy having their nation critiqued by modern art students who fill trash bags with sand in order to express themselves . 
  by all means i as a working person who has a not bullshit job , i can entirely understand why i should be subsidizing your personal exploration . 
  and please tell me how our military expenditures are just a total waste . 
  of course you live in a developed country which is basically capable of things like domestic disaster relief . 
  but as i recall after the indonesian earthquake it was n't the dutch who used their aircraft carriers to supply fresh water , supplies , and medical relief to those who had lost their homes and families . 
  but once again , i 'm certain that me paying for your bullshit liberal arts degree is a better way to spend our national resources . 
  and just fyi i 'm a liberal , who is in favor of nationalized healthcare and increased social spending in ** some ** areas of our society . 
  but i have no interest in becoming a european state that subsidizes fine arts degrees and erasmus programs for 30 year old students who need to get off their ass and pay their own way . 
  ... uhhh , yeah so any way , eastern europeans , not spoiled twats who think that they live in a fairy land where their personal desires and comfort trumps all the other concerns in the world for everyone . 
  foreign corrupt practices act . 
  do n't fuck with it . 
  gavrilo princip was a serbian nationalist . 
   erdogan will make a backdoor deal with the us . 
  ha , not likely . 
  erdigan could * at best * hope that his name is left out of court proceedings so much as that is possible to avoid political attention . 
  conspiring to subvert u.s. sanctions puts you on the top of the government 's shit list . 
  and they have a solid recent history off putting big bangs and individuals through the wringer on issues like these . 
  it is n't even clear that is ** actually happened ** some random guy claiming that he spouted off to a muslim on twitter . 
  i 'm sure that would never happen , i 'm sure people actually do all the things they claim to do online ? 
  the guys a prick , he 's rude , he is n't following muslims around trying to ruin their lives . 
  he 's at worst making rude off putting statements to people who do n't deserve it . 
  that 's a shitty way to behave , to actually arrest someone for it is borderline nuts . 
  i actually would be apologetic of the second iraq war because it was such an abject failure and miscalculation . 
  i 'd even arguably be apologetic about the first because i believe if us diplomacy had been more direct the war could have been avoided . 
  both interventions in the former yugoslav republics achieved the necessary military and political objectives with minimal collateral damage . 
  if you want me to apologize for my country putting and end to genocide of bosniak muslims and putting and end to a conflict before another genocide could poetentially begin , you should go looking for another american . 
  the ambitions for a `` greater serbia '' already sparked a world war and the first post world war genocide in europe . 
  i hold no ill will towards serbia or the serbian people and i would hope our countries could move forward constructively ( and i believe that is already happening ) . 
  but i 'm not offering any apologies . 
  you did n't give an example , you posited a hypothetical that there exist people in society so wildly sensitive that they can not stand to hear any criticism of their beliefs without spiraling into psychological decay . 
  it is not reasonable to restrain freedom of expression in defense of a hypothetical personage who is so thin skinned as to be unable to stomach not a single world that counters their own views . 
  your premise is ridiculous and outlandish , and so my examples are also ridiculous and outlandish . 
  in such a theoretical situation how would anyone be allowed to do anything in a free society without someone claiming that your behavior has `` injured '' you ? 
  some examples : the teacher told me my work was sub-par , which shattered my confidence , so now all of my work is sub par , but i should pass the class because the only reason my work is sub par is because the teacher criticized me . 
  someone left a bad review about my restaurant , which caused me to have an anxiety attack so i could n't open my restaurant . 
  so i lost a lot of customers and had to shut down my restaurant and now the food critic owes me money for destroying my business . 
  someone laughed at the cross i wear , and said christianity is a lie . 
  i hold deep christian beliefs and this even caused me to have an identity crisis , massive stress , and self doubt , which required 15k in counseling . 
  the person who insulted my cross is thus directly responsible for my need for therapy and so he owes me 15k . 
  we live in a society and that society does not revolve around us . 
  while some people may have incredibly think skin that makes it difficult for them to live with other people . 
  that is not the fault of other individuals in society . 
  and it is not reasonable to curtail the freedom of everyone in order to ensure the emotional security of every citizen . 
  or to phrase this in a more american way `` sometimes you just need to sack up and grow a pair , the whole world is n't a liberal arts college and you are n't always going to get your way . '', 
  alright i 'll change the language so it 's more clear . 
  america does not curtail freedom of * expression * , which is what freedom of speech means in this context . 
  the first amendment protects the right of expression which is why it protects actions which are not literall speech ( as in spoken words ) . 
  that is why the flag burning is protected under the first amendment even though burning a flag is not literally speech . 
  the freedom of expression is more or less unlimited , but it does n't mean that you 're allowed to do ** whatever ** you want whenever . 
  other people still have rights , you can not kill people or destroy the property of others and claim freedom of expression as a defense . 
  americans are allowed to express themselves in just about any way imaginable so long as your expression does not materially harm others . 
  in europe freedom of expression is curtailed simply because some people think the sentiments are objectionable and they feel that they ** might ** in some way lead to material harm . 
  but there is no burden to actually prove that materially harm has been rendered ( which would be a requirement in the u.s. ) . 
  in cases like this there is very little basis for the curtailment of expression other than `` we feel like this is a bad thing to say , we have no evidence that anyone has been injured in any way , but we do n't like it so it 's against the law '' . 
  if you can not interpret the ** massive ** functional difference between these two standards than i think this conversation is over . 
  hard to say , i 'm a die hard liberal but i flat out ca n't stand this regressive liberalism that abandons liberal values in favor of `` cultural sensitivity '' . 
  it 's shameful for liberals to elevate `` respect '' for other cultures over the values of liberalism . 
  not letting women vote was once an american cultural `` value '' and that did n't stop people from fighting for women 's suffrage . 
  i consider the abandonment of values like women 's rights to be a shameful abandonment of liberal principles . 
  and certain liberals attempt to disguise their abandonment of values as deference for other cultures . 
  but conservatives are hardly the people to rally behind regarding respect for individual rights . 
  the conservative attitude lately seems to be states rights / individual rights , unless those states or individuals do something we do n't like . 
  ahh i see that you are a deep thinker , all questions are best answered in a binary manner right ? 
  well if you 're talking about a situation where a person is in some manner forcefully subjected to this speech , in a way that they can not escape the speech ( like changing the channel , avoiding a sub-reddit , or unfollowing a twitter antagonist ) . 
  so assuming there is no method to escape this would be considered harassment , which is illegal in the united states too . 
  what you can not do is say `` this speech exists and it offends me and so it can not exist '' . 
  if i were to listen to rush limbaugh all day i would probably get a heart palpitation . 
  luckily for me i am not in any way required to listen to his program . 
  it would be pretty unreasonable for me to claim that his speech harmed me when the reasonable response would be to turn off his show . 
  guess i was confused by this statement from scotland yard . 
   `` we have arrested a 46-year-old man on suspicion of inciting racial hatred on social media . 
   `` he was arrested tonight at an address in croydon ** and remains in custody at a south london police station . 
  ** '' but hey i 'm just reading the articles people post , not doing a whole research topic on the subject . 
   that 's not true , not by a long shot . 
  yeah , it really is . 
  the u.s is almost entirely energy independent , we are ( depending on the week ) either the largest or second largest producer of oil . 
  we also have enormous natural gas , and coal reserves . 
  the u.s. has more than enough arable land to easily sustain its population without importing food stuffs . 
  the u.s. has local access to almost all of the necessary raw materials metals and minerals . 
  also most of the fresh water on the planet that is n't ice .
