   yeah , you export $ 1.62 trillion worth of stuff and import $ 2.35 trillion worth of stuff . 
  in layman terms , this means you buy a lot more stuff from other countries than you sell to other countries , which is the complete opposite of self sufficiency . 
  you 're thinking far too simplistically . 
  and ignoring perhaps the most valuable commodity that there is ** a market ** . 
  needing an enormous export market to maintain your internal economy does n't make you independent , it makes you ** enormously ** dependent on your customers . 
  germany , china , japan , all countries that are almost entirely dependent on the u.s. market , and u.s. free trade agreements to maintain their global access to energy , materials , and once again ** markets ** . 
  if china were to say `` you know what , screw you america , we are n't going to sell you stuff anymore '' . 
  who do you think would be more damaged , the united states or china ? 
  the united states ** could easily ** find another country to manufacture those products and sell them to the united states . 
  in fact we have a neighbor with a population of over 100 million , and deep economic ties to the united states that ** would love ** the business . 
  and of course we could make them ourselves , in fact there 's currently a bit of a resurgence happening in american made apparel at the moment . 
  but where oh where is china going to find 320 million new customers with an annual median income of over 50,000 usd ? 
  the answer , no where , because one of the hardest things to replace in the world is ? 
  customers . 
  ahhh this old argument . 
  in the u.s. the only curtailment on free speech is if the speech is used in a direct manner to cause material harm . 
  this is something which can actually be objectively determined . 
  if yelling fire in a crowded building causes people to be injured than it can be ** objectively ** stated that speech was used to cause material harm to others . 
  if you without basis call someone say , a pedophile , and as a result they lose their job , or their business loses custom , or hostility drives them from their neighborhood . 
  they can sue you for slander , and once again they can demonstrate that they have been ** materially ** harmed by the exercise of ** false ** speech . 
  in the u.s. you are not allowed to use speech , especially false speech , as a weapon . 
  the use of speech in this manner can be clearly defined and damage can be accurately assessed in an ** objective ** manner . 
  that is totally different from someone claiming that a particular phrase , comment , or message , considered in a ** subjective ** manner , has caused them harm , and they are under no obligation to demonstrate evidence of that harm . 
  do you understand the difference ? 
  one law considers the question in a quantitative manner , the other is qualitative and based entirely on subjective interpretation . 
  for the sake of illustrating a complete argument here , there are a few other fairly minor curtailments on free speech in the us . 
  these are typically state level laws on things like profanity . 
  they are not typically enforced , and an attempt to enforce them would likely result in the laws themselves being struck down as a curtailment of free speech . 
  fyi , it 's extremely easy to keep a totally ridiculous law on the books in the united states so long as you never attempt to actually enforce the law . 
  the moment you attempt to enforce it you give someone grounds to challenge it and especially in first amendment cases you 'll probably lose . 
   the whole biological basis of race is weird . 
  there is no biological basis for race . 
  race is not a biological term and it is more or less meaningless . 
  we are all homo sapiens sapiens . 
  within the our species there is genetic diversity which causes people to have different traits . 
  differences in genetics stem more or less entirely from environmental differences which made certain traits more beneficial ( or harmful ) to different populations . 
  but all homo sapiens sapiens can inter breed which is the most practical biological distinction between genetically unique organisms . 
  race is a made up term by people who do n't understand biology or genetics . 
   is n't not like he was thrown in prison for saying something stupid . 
  uhhh that seems like exactly what is happening , he is after all currently in custody . 
  he * may have * said something stupid , something rude and incentive . 
  he did n't attack or harm someone , he did n't threaten them , he did n't attempt to incite violence . 
  this is on the level of being arrested because you call someone an ugly cow , yeah it 's rude , but being arrested for it , like its a crime , i do n't think i 'll ever understand europeans . 
  the guy seems like a socially awkward prick . 
  but are you seriously suggesting that he deserves to be arrested for being a prick ? 
   yeah , lets just forget those who died , those who were fucked for life , and all the following years of poverty . 
  yeah sort of , that 's more or less what we do and how we managed to move on as a country after our own civil war . 
  and how we 've managed to have extremely productive relationships with germany , japan , italy , etc. 
  post ww2 . 
  you either wallow in the past or you accept it and move into the future , grievances will never be settled , they never are , but they can be forgotten . 
   which is almost funny seeing how you do n't know a single thing about the conflict . 
  i know that it 's over and both sides feel like the victim and probably always will . 
  what more needs to be said ? 
  lack of relevance , europe is over there , it has little to no impact on the lives of most americans . 
  just because you learned calculus in high school does n't mean you 'll remember much of it ten years later , unless you use it , ie * it 's actually a part of your work and your life . 
  the united states is one of the most self sufficient and internalized countries on earth ( see our trade deficit ) . 
  our bilateral relationship with canada and mexico is ( in economic terms ) enormous . 
  in terms of total trade the us / can / mex relationship is worth more than our relationship with china , japan , germany , south korea , and the uk combined . 
  the remainder of our 15 largest trading partners ( france , brazil , saudi arabia , india , taiwan , the netherlands , switzerland , and italy , are ** combined ** equivalent to our relationship with mexico . 
  in other words the united states is not very internationalized and the vast majority of our internationalization involves our two neighbors . 
  americans are thus largely unaware of the wider world because first and foremost it is largely irrelevant to their lives . 
  and secondly because the rest of the world is very far away and expensive to reach , most americans wo n't leave the north american continent during their lifetime . 
  [ uhhh we actual prefer to be called first nation people ] ( http://southparkstudios.mtvnimages.com/images/shows/south-park/clip-thumbnails/season-15/1513/south-park-s15e13c01-a-real-live-native-american-16x9.jpg ? ), 
   serbs are still evil incarnated in most western countries . 
  most americans do n't know what a serb is , and if you asked them to guess they 'd probably assume some people in the middle east . 
  i 'm not apologetic in the slightest for 90 's interventions in the balkans but i do n't carry an ounce of ill will towards the people . 
  shit happened , a conclusion was reached , the violence ended . 
  trying to assign blame at this point accomplishes nothing , better to be happy that the violence is over and to find a way to move forward and address future grievances peacefully . 
  if everyone involved wants to continue to believe that they and no one else is the wronged party that 's fine too . 
  just do n't pick up arms and go to war with your neighbors . 
  no , also i 'm going to need some money , not for a wall ... 
  and here i thought having our own flair meant we were allowed to participate in this sub . 
  was i wrong ? 
  1 ) white house gets repainted red , white and blue . 
  2 ) u.s. president given trained bald eagle that sits on his shoulder . 
  president must keep sam the eagle with him at all times . 
  3 ) voting ballots are replaced by voting targets , shoot the target of the person you want to vote for . 
  too much inaccuracy invalidates your vote , because common . 
  4 ) return to the moon 2 , now with more moon . 
  5 ) drunk call rate to european heads of state goes through the roof . 
  prime ministerial logbook `` u.s. president called , said our aircraft carriers were `` totally fucking gay '' followed by five minutes of usa chanting '' . 
  i can expand this list almost indefinitely but i think you get the picture . 
  i 'm not sure , do most europeans have a sense of shame about dealing with saudi arabia ? 
  because this may come as a shock but america is n't the only country that buys and uses oil . 
  the u.s. imports considerably less oil from saudi arabia than we import from canada , and we produce a pretty substantial amount of oil domestically . 
  https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbbl_m.htm i have mixed feelings about the u.s. saudi relationship , but i think the nature and supposed uniqueness of that relationship is pretty wildly exaggerated . 
   buy gold , buy another currency , i can give you tons of examples . 
  you can also buy these things with `` digital '' currency . 
  in fact i do it all the time when i send someone money not denominated in usd . 
  i buy the currency they want with my usd and then send them the that money , all done digitally . 
  you can also buy gold with your digital bank account . 
  you ca n't really use gold , or the currency the non-national currency you 've just bought but hey you can certainly buy it . 
   how about the govt deciding to take money from your account ? 
  is that something you like ? 
  how about the government choosing to invalidate the existing currency , which is something which can occur with or without bank accounts or digital currency . 
  case and point what happened to burmese kyat  only two years later , on 5 september 1987 , the government demonetised the 25 - , 35 - , and 75-kyat notes without warning or compensation , rendering some 75 % of the country 's currency worthless . 
  on 22 september 1987 , banknotes for 45 and 90 kyat were introduced , both of which incorporated ne win 's favourite number , nine . 
  the resulting economic disturbances led to serious riots ( see 8888 uprising ) and eventually a coup d'\u00e9tat in 1988 by general saw maung . 
   a degree of independence is a good thing . 
  having all your money in a bank does n't really make you independent at all .
