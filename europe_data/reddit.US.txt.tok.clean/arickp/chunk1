your flair shows up fine on reddit desktop , maybe it 's a bug in your mobile app ( or you were able to fix it ), 
  i do n't think that 's the way to look at it . 
  it 's a small sub so it 's mostly regulars that all know each other ... it does n't really have a political leaning to it . 
  they 've done a survey on location and political beliefs , but it 's in serbian and i ca n't find it right now . 
  [ they carpet bombed / r/all with memes against / r/the _ donald ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/4ep8wf/rthe_donald_makes_a_post_illustrating_sweden_as_a/ ), 
  it 's a common misconception that a lot of us outside of poland have had about the region . 
  i made an / r/askeurope thread asking if pan-slavism is still a thing and the most upvoted response was `` it was never a thing , / u/arickp ... '' we see stuff like the russia/serbia connection and just think `` ah , well they are both slavic and orthodox , '' but it 's way more nuanced than that . 
  you ca n't take the russia/serbia connection and think it will apply to , say , poland and the czech republic , thinking that it applies because they 're both slavic and majority catholic . 
  they never did , he 's meme'ing us, 
  either that or just make the white text not quite as thick ( / r/florida has the same concept , the font just is n't as bold ) . 
  also wondering if a brighter image getting rotated would make the white text harder to read . 
  i tried it two times , one i talked for a couple minutes but the other i talked to for 35 minutes . 
  it 's pretty refreshing to just talk about normal every day stuff and not the angry political things you see on reddit . 
  she talked a bit about her trip to chicago and i asked some questions about her sailing trip in croatia . 
  united kingdom - reckitt beckinser they make what we call suboxone in the us ( [ buprenorphine and naloxone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buprenorphine ) , it 's used to treat opiate dependence , kind of like methadone ) . 
  and i 'm glad they do !, 
  it does n't work for everyone , but it 's a life-saver for some . 
  hmm i knew it was somewhere in europe because they sponsor an annual event called `` flugtag . '', 
  yeah / r/europe is getting trolled hard here . 
  this is like when one of the new mods of / r/serbia [ pretended to have a child slave ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/myfriendwantstoknow/comments/42fdaw/mfwtk_where_modern_slave_owners_get_their_slaves/cz9zkmx ) and most everyone believed him . 
  yeah i agree . 
  and marijuana is still illegal at the federal level ( schedule i by the dea , the `` worst '' kind ) anyway , the feds just decide to look the other way . 
  haha do n't forget the bum bag/fanny pack, 
  heh , yeah . . or something technical . 
  eh i feel like canada is just as bad in that regard . 
  just how often do we hear about crippling alcoholism in first nations people ? 
  even when trudeau visited the white house , they were talking about shit like who won the last stanley cup ...

  yes , it 's even showing in the us . 
  for my city , though , it 's only at the `` artsy '' theater near downtown at a crappy time ( 16:45 ) . 
  yup . 
  and you still need to know which syllables are accented in phonetic languages . 
  the latter is what [ the weight of chains ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waeyq46gh08 ) is about , right ?

  i 've gotten condescension * once * on / r/serbia for being american ( i have it in my flair ) when i said something about milo\u0161evi\u0107 .
