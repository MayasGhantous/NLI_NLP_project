  need to wait five years after your last misdemeanor , or 10 for a felony ( and they go off what 's considered a felony in canada , so dui = 10 years ) .

  hey op , you 're asking an interesting question but i think you 're getting downvoted because it comes off as a bit `` bait-y . '', 
  maybe a better version would be `` in europe , are certain items banned/regulated to promote the health and welfare of the citizens ? '', 
  ( people can pick up the implication that it would save health care costs . ), 
  also there 's / r/askeurope :-), 
  old thread , was looking here to see what hungarian sounds like . 
  i think romanian is in the middle . 
  sorry if it 's not a very good answer but i ca n't think of any other way to say it .

  she has her own country in italian !, 
  yup , bo\u017eo in croatian, 
  same for montenegro , you 'd think they 'd use something closer to the serbocroatian name ( crna gora ), 
  i guess slavic brotherhood does n't mean much now , the us ( barely ) beats serbia :(, 
  hehe , there is a redditor on / r/croatia ( i think he lives there ) with the flair `` srbin xoxo '', 
  and free pig to spit roast,

  the literal names of the countries in chinese is interesting . 
  greece is `` insurance profit '' or something . 
  croatia is `` crow to asia . '', 
  should be on / r/mapporn somewhere . 
  edit : [ the map ] ( https://haonowshaokao.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/europe_map_political.jpg ) i do n't speak chinese although `` this is wrong because x '' is always more helpful than `` this is wrong . '',

  belgrade = white city but named after the fortress there .

  [ here 's a link to one of her songs . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/maf44gs2_ce ), 
  can you imagine using the hungarian name for vojvodina ? 
  * vajdas\u00e1gban * i always say that people would think serbia is a south slavic country across the adriatic from italy if the capital was novi sad ( sounds latin ) and the country was named vojvodina ( sounds slavic ) . 
  if we used the serbian name for belgrade - * beograd * - people would think it 's in the ex-ussr somewhere . 
  [ turns out , you do n't even need to say the * je * ... ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ynrvry3.jpg ), 
  do native speakers actually know the names of all those cases , or is just instinct ? 
  like when i ask serbs `` what case is * na redditu * , '' half of them are like ... uhh . 
  the right one . 
  ( [ context ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/serbian/comments/3y61tt/til_crnogorski_has_two_additional_letters_in_its/ ) ), 
  [ example from serbia ] ( http://youtu.be/aiehuxds1vk ) if anyone is curious . 
  technically goga was born in montenegro though . 
  for the drama . 
  serbia : borko stefanovi\u0107 , i think he 'd be in a position to talk candidly about corruption , eu membership , etc. 
  yup , lots of `` le putin is a real man '' posts in / r/forwardsfromgrandma ( which is mostly usa political `` forwards '' ), 
  green everywhere . 
  also * good sarma * good burek * good \u010devapi i normally agree with everything op posts as i 'm basically `` serbia-chan '' ( a mini-crnaruka , so to speak ) but i have to disagree with him on this one, 
  [ houston , texas , usa ] ( http://imgur.com/t6w6bpc ) it 's 27 \u00b0 c here today ! . . 
  i was wondering the same thing , / r/croatia is full of memes and jokes about this bo\u017eo guy . 
  evo : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xwmpy/whats_going_on_in_croatia/ https://np.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/3xxav8/anarhija_srijedom_december_23_2015/cy8t3ej, 
  gon na need an explanation on this one , i get the '' - anon '' part but not the `` tri - . '', 
  punch line on the first one is that serbia uses cyrillic ( and latin ) if anyone 's wondering . 
  thanks , what 's cc acc ? 
  this is old , but here you go -- go to op 's post history and sort by best posts of all time all of them are basically not portraying croats in a positive light because of the croatian usta\u0161a . 
  the joke is that everything he posts is about the ustasha . 
  edit : the comment by / u/mewkazami below me is probably right too , `` three '' has some kind of significance . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/serbia/comments/3qvwxt/strip/cwisy93  needs more 3 prsta prsta = fingers edit 2 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three-finger_salute_%28serbian%29 so the joke makes sense in both contexts . 
  - 3 as in the three-finger salute , ustasha because op is obsessed with them . 
  that 's less bizarre than [ the ana thing ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/3skg7o ) at least . . 
  actually i thought they were talking about god at first . 
  in serbian ( and i 'm assuming croatian ) bog = god but you use * bo\u017ee * in certain grammatical cases . 
  they 're not pronounced the same . 
  \u017e = zh, 
  am american , voted for srbija . 
  can you imagine what a paradise it 'd be to eat \u010devapi and listen to the knind\u017ea all day ? 
  you did n't include republika srpska , you-know-who is going to be mad . 
  ( yes i know it 's not a country ),
