  set a flair when you use desktop reddit , so we know which `` we '' you 're talking about !, 
  my croatian is n't great , but they keep posting about some guy named bo\u017eo petrov on / r/croatia . 
  do you like any dutch rappers ? 
  mr. polska and ronnie flex are some of my favorites . 
  92 % 2:36 i had problems with monaco and malta , also i mixed up vatican city and san marino . 
  could you explain the * - ov\u00e1 * ending ? 
  is it added even in the nominative case ? 
   west virginia - to the west of virginia , presumably . 
  is american dad set here ? 
  i believe it 's set in a fictional washington d.c. suburb called langley falls , virginia . 
  so , just plain ol' virginia . 
  i took a picture of [ this sign ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9hilpye.jpg ) over the weekend . 
  sa\u0161a mati\u0107 , the serbian stevie wonder , is stopping by all the places here with significant diaspora communities . 
  kinda curious who wrote the sign as * nedelja * is in ekavian ( it was outside a bosnian grocery ) . 
  would it be fair to include hungarian cz\u00e1rd\u00e1s as a folklore that 's similar to polka ? 
  ( i had n't heard of cz\u00e1rd\u00e1s before , but in the thread where someone was asked to characterize the various european cultures , one person listed cz\u00e1rd\u00e1s and goluash as important cultural items in the central european countries . 
  i knew polka because , like you said , it made its way to my country via immigration a couple generations ago . ), 
  i did n't know what people were talking about for the longest time either . 
  the way someone described the hfcs/sugar difference in soda is : try to gauge how much it quenches your thirst . 
  the real sugar drinks are going to quench it better because they 're less `` syrupy . '', 
  just like how a bottle of maple syrup would probably make you feel worse if you were parched ( it 's an extreme example , but i do n't think it 's apples and oranges , either ) . 
  / r/unpopularopinion : i actually like hfcs drinks over real sugar drinks , but there is a difference ( at least for mt. 
  dew -- some drinks not as much ) , and i probably just like the hfcs versions because that 's what i 'm used to . 
  it could be that deleted posts from / r/europe about travel questions are being sent here . 
  a possible alternative is a stickied megathread , that 's what / r/croatia does . 
  [ sorry to disappoint . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/tasmania/search?q=bluejeans90210&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) or he 's * really * interested in tasmania . 
  you 're probably thinking of / r/anormaldayinrussia . 
  that 's the `` troll '' one , although it 's mostly just in good fun . 
  i mean it 'd be hard to troll people from a country that barely use reddit compared to other countries . 
  i suppose the confusion comes because the images of ___ subs quote you in the titles , kinda like shit * whomever * says or / r/iamverysmart , etc. 
  hmm google 's giving me mixed results on the shorts thing . 
  are we talking about basketball/athletic shorts or a nice pair of khaki shorts ? 
  [ someone even made an askreddit thread about them ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/38lmpp/why_are_shorts_frowned_upon_in_europe/ ) also , haha , i literally just learned the word * bum bag * yesterday , it was on a game show as `` what do the british call a fanny pack ? '', 
  it 's all talk . 
  just how many people moved to canada after obama was elected ? 
   kurwa [ like this guy ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-bgrekkjcg ), 
  interesting !, 
  i guess that 's a bit different from `` yugonostalgia '' as you identified as a marxist and not a titoist ? 
  i 'm picking on / r/me _ irl here because they 're doing the `` no , we 're serious . '', 
  thing ( kinda like how people are going to / r/outoftheloop and asking if / r/the _ donald is serious ) . 
  the politburo stuff on / r/latvianjokes , i would n't imagine a latvian having an issue with . 
  maybe the `` we serious '' part * is * the joke , who knows . 
  ah , well , i know a dark joke about * those * kind of organs , but it 's usually said for kosovo . 
  opro\u0161tite but it 's a * woooosh * here . 
  are you talking about this ? 
   kie\u0142basa hmm so are we really supposed to be pronouncing it as `` kiewbasa '' then in english ? 
  it 's the same with last names obviously , they get all mangled here . 
  i guess , for helsinki ( and a lot of europe !, 
  ) , there is also the issue of making sure snow and ice removal is adequate for the safety of the pedestrians . 
  i guess this got caught in the spam filter and your essay is probably already due . 
  do you still need help ? 
  when learning a foreign language , half the fun is learning about the * culture * of its speakers . 
  that 's why i would n't be thrilled about replacing french language courses here with esperanto . 
  i 'm learning serbo-croatian , which only has 19 million speakers . 
  it 'll be useful whenever i get to serbia for a vacation ( especially in the less urban areas ) , but that is n't why i 'm doing it ... i want to understand the lyrics in a song , watch a movie without subtitles , watch their news programs , etc. 
  if you make a thread on / r/languagelearning about `` which language should i learn ? 
  '' , they 'll just tell you to learn the one that interests you , not `` well , you live next to ( blah ) , which has this percentage of ( whatever ) speakers . '', 
  ( and they 'll flair your post as `` why not uzbek ? '', 
  as an inside joke . ), 
  so i guess just see it as `` ah , so this guy wants to absorb our culture '' rather than `` this guy wants to prepare for his trip . '', 
  tl ; dr we learn because it 's fun . 
  that is pretty neat . 
  i guess it 's like that for all former eastern bloc countries but it 's getting better now . 
  obviously i was joking with the phrases , but yes there is a lot of swearing in the balkans . 
  i think the croats will be the most impressed out of all those countries if you try to learn some simple phrases , at least * dobar dan * ( hello ) and * hvala * ( thanks ) . 
  there are some links on / r/croatia if you want . 
  if you want more information about croatia , you may want to post to their sub . 
  unfortunately i have n't seen any ex-yu users on here except for slovenia . 
  they are very friendly there !, 
  did you pick dubrovnik because of got ? 
   most of us in the u.s. do n't really have croatia on our radar like europe does . 
  may want to learn these handy phrases in croatian : * jebote * . 
  also * u pi\u010dku materinu *, 
  any menus you can link ? 
  i might be able to read a bit of slovene . . 
   the bartlett presidency is a ( us ) liberal fantasy nailed it . 
  we used the show to keep sane , as it aired during the bush jr. years . 
  yea , so this is one that us americans get wrong a lot too . 
  some people just assume eastern bloc = eastern europe and start lumping countries like the czech republic in there too . 
  or eastern bloc = `` behind the iron curtain , '' even though yugoslavia was n't . 
  agree about amsterdam . 
  part of it was also because they had gay marriage before we did . 
  acceptance of homosexuality is becoming less of a cultural divide between us ( thank god ) . 
  heh , if you 're learning a foreign language , [ people knowing english can be a bad thing ... ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yaca_w_yvji/visw0vrc_ci/aaaaaaaacv8/ubxosuipgto/s1600/49.png ) i 'm guessing czech is like serbian and has different grammatical cases that you use to pick the appropriate declension . 
  that can be pretty hard . 
  i think us americans are confused about the welsh language in general ( as well as the irish language ) . 
  we just do n't know how common it is ; e.g. , are there street signs in welsh ? 
  will i meet someone who only speaks it ? 
  [ this / r/askuk thread has some good answers , luckily . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askuk/comments/2nqqfp/are_there_welsh_speakers_who_have_english_as/ ) yes i guess we do think it 's a cthulu language because of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhxo0udpoxm ) . 
  i 've seen that stereotype for croatia too . 
  maybe catholics just get picked on ... 
  cause the active sub is / r/askanamerican  but yes , never heard of it . 
  ah yeah , i was more interesting from a cultural exchange pov , but now til i 'm a year too old anyway . 
  lol . 
  luckily things are getting better for me now . 
  i am guessing a vacation in zagreb or ljubljana would be a lot cheaper once you 're able to get there , though . 
  [ is this the same ?
