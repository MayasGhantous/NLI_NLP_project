  no , representative government on the national level is shallow at best . 
  though i live in canada i am an american ( pursuing dual right now ) , and i can tell you that americans have been dealing with a nonrepresentative government for years . 
  examples : debt ceiling default & subsequent downgrade . 
  do you think that was representative activity or just powers playing for more of their own power . 
  the drone war in yemen . 
  no one even discusses this . 
  no one voted on it . 
  no congress people argued over it . 
  the military industrial complex ( mic hereafter ) just decided to do it . 
  libya . 
  unlike all other war activities previously in us history , obama took the us to war by his own fiat . 
  congress declares war . 
  but obama circumvented congress & no one had the balls to challenge him . 
  what obama did there was an impeachable offense . 
  government shutdowns : do you think that any common citizens wanted that ? 
  the answer is no . 
  again and again , the powers that be just play their games . 
  it often seems to me that the us is breaking up into castes , & the political caste plays the election wag-the-dog games but is essentially answerable to no one . 
  it 's the same as 1500 years ago when thucydides said that the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must . 
  tl ; dr : it 's sadly naive to think that the us actually had a representative government . 
  i used to think so too . 
  america is the major world power and has been kicking up shit for the past few years . 
  however , european hands are by no means clean in this , contemporarily . 
  i find the comments here to be silly and in the exact same vein as the shock of the snowden revelations which then turned into revelations that european national agencies were doing the exact same things and generally in cahoots with the us . 
  i look at the french & british instigation of regime change in libya & france 's extended activities in africa & think that the only difference between the us and european nations is a matter of degree , not nature . 
  tl ; dr : everyone should mind their own business and many western european nations could benefit from being told this . 
  you 're speaking for yourself & maybe a slice of your demographic . 
  do you really think that you 're speaking for ` middle america ' ? 
  people who shop exclusively at walmart ? 
  the bible belt ? 
  all those demographic groups vote , and your opinions do n't carry over to them . 
  moreover , your vote counts for just as much worth as any one of theirs . 
  because in some ways , especially concerning the doings of the military industrial complex , the american people live with a nonrepresentative government . 
  in other ways , especially domestic social policy at the state level , americans do enjoy representative government . 
  but it varies . 
  and the military powers that be continue on in the fashion that they see fit . 
  what amazes me is that no on mentions the * war * that is going on in yemen and has been for a long time . 
  this war has no gropos on the ground , only drones . 
  but it is an american war nonetheless . 
  grim place , a very autumnal city . 
  but splendidly good eats , i found . 
  venison tenderloin with seared foie , stewed apples , & peppercorn sauce . 
  and that was just one . 
  some of the absolute best meals i have ever had were in warsaw . 
  those folks take hospitality very seriously . 
  the whole question is just the circuses part of [ bread & circuses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bread_and_circuses ) . 
  it has no functional relevance to anything other than what people like to talk about . 
   recently changed flag . 
  liked the old one better . 
  new one just screams `` crusader state '' . 
  [ old ] ( http://www.flagheaven.co.nz/prodimages/georgia-old_m%5b1%5d.gif ) vs [ holy moley ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/world-countries-flags/georgia-flag.gif ), 
  til european dogs are lightweights . 
  toronto dogs eat the needles right out of the junkies ' arms . 
  only if they meant to stay . 
  re : the woman in belgium . 
  in the words of bob dylan , ` it ai n't me , babe ' . 
  i find such absurd entitlement as laughable as you do . 
  is it a human right for anyone to live in any nation they want to live in ? 
  read breaking news from rt ( sorry ) which said that an agreement has been reached to defer default by several months . 
  did n't mention the price of tea partier consent however . 
  was n't the uk archipelago fenlands long ago ? 
  the # 1 thing i miss from the us is amazon delivering anything & everything to your door . 
  amazon.ca is a pale shadow of amazon.com . 
  i also miss computer components being priced reasonably . 
  what i do n't miss in a # 1 fashion are the crime & the politics . 
  holy mackerel , that was amazing . 
  brady sounds rather new-age-y in that arrangement . 
  dunno if [ dubliners ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrnou-7gi4o ) is a little cliched for you , but it 's a nice arrangement . 
  it 's threads like these that make me an avid / r/europe reader . 
  here 's hungary 's [ muzsik\u00e1s : r\u00e9gen volt , sok\u00e1 lesz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0_sc_femaw ) and czech rep 's [ \u010cechomor - promeny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez31v68uoey ) ( audio is quiet here , but i happily liken them to aaron copeland meets czech folk rock . 
  very good stuff ) . 
  cheers & tyvm for thread . 
  pretty sure that the phrases , ` neither here nor there ' & wearing one 's ` heart on one 's sleeve ' both come from othello . 
   there might be more , sometimes they 're like ~ ~ ninjas ~ ~ [ nazgul ] ( http://webpages.charter.net/quantim/quantim/nazgul.jpg ) . 
  it seems that the us does immigration by brain-drain ( i.e. , highly selective immigration based on education , skills , & general marketability of prospective immigrants ) much more than europe ( and canada , for that matter ) . 
  a result of that immigration policy is that making demographic group comparisons across western nations does n't work too well , as different strata of source nations are being imported . 
  coming to warsaw in february ( i know : fuck me , right ? ) . 
  but only for a few days on business . 
  looking forward to food & vodka . 
  basically taking the old northern rule : get drunk enough so that you do n't feel the cold on the way home . 
  note : i agree with you . 
  i am just playing devil 's advocate here and am hoping for an engaging answer : i argue that your first example is exactly the sort that needs to be banned as it is hateful personal abuse . 
  i argue that your second example should not be banned . 
  it is a racist , abhorrent view , but a view nonetheless , not an attack . 
  as such , if this person is from europe ( and the flag flair is portugal ) , then it ipso facto belongs in / r/europe as much as any other view . 
  they say sunlight is the best disinfectant . 
  do you not see room for the proposition that shedding light on this view and engaging it point by point to counter it , rather than extirpating it , would be the wiser course ? 
  israel : we 're taking more & fuck you . 
  hamas : we 're taking all & we 'll kill you . 
  is it any wonder that israel digs in its heels deeper & listens even less when countries such as these show their lack of even-handedness ? 
  what denmark , finland , portugal , & ireland did here is the very opposite of engagement . 
  it 's pretty fucking amazing the way things turned out : alcohol & tobacco , the two most addictive & arguably most destructive drugs , are the two legal ones . 
  sorry , i know that 's been said again & again , but i just spent a good deal of time at a medical conference going over this stuff . 
  jews = !, 
  israelis . 
  and when people treat jews like they are answerable for all activities in israel , that 's bigotry . 
  and bigotry is wrong . 
  i think you 're supposed to understand that . 
  are you a fan of israeli attacks in gaza or american attacks in pakistan ? 
  if so , then your stance makes sense .
