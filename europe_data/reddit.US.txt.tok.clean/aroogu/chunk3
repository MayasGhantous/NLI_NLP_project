  if not , then why are you happy with your own nation being as disagreeable to you as your examples ? 
  holy smokes , nick clegg is still around ? 
  i though the tories shoved him in a linen closet or something . 
  found the racist !, 
  finn privilege strikes again !, 
  i do n't blame them at all . 
  it 's a scandalous display of wrists and ears . 
  maybe / u/ganymede07011610 wants them to wait , 
  you 're not living up to your username too well you know . 
  you know how to rob the khajit boxes ? 
  outside markarth & solitude ? 
  inside dawnstar ? 
  this one can tell you . 
  oh , my mistake . 
  sorry about that & thanks for the correction . 
  stirring already violent shit up & meddling stupidly & inexcusably \u2260 making . 
  i 've never heard any german voices which would advocate for asylum in russia . 
  can anybody eli5 what 's up with that ? 
  absence of dialogue just entrenches differences on both sides . 
  that 's true everywhere . 
  i 'm not sure how good it is to take factual news as trolling . 
  that word again . 
  you 're projecting some baggage i 'm afraid . 
  so nationalism is bad for jews and good for palestinians 's and anything else is racist ? 
  i do not think that word means what you think it means . 
  doubt he 'd say the same thing about a palestinian nation , which is why it 's pretense . 
  were there named mohammed ? 
  only as proper swedes . 
  btw , kabbalah is claptrap run by charlatans and ne'er do wells selling red pieces of string at high cost to be connected to a jewish mysticism which has no historical continuity culturally or religiously . 
  in the nid 20thc , gershom scholem revived interest in a backwater mysticism which never amounted to much . 
  the funny part is that everything that kabbalists go on about was taken from a scholar who had no belief in kabbalism and considered it a historical artifact of people being silly . 
  edit : the deal is that if you play numerica games with hebrew letters one day you will find the true name of god and then have power , underatanding , true connection to the divine , etc. 
  plus you get a nifty red string bracelet . 
   in germany you still have to have proof , before you [ persecute ] ( http://www.newhopeladies.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/persecute.jpg ) someone . 
  sometimes the jokes just write themselves . 
  [ r/ripworldnews ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ripworldnews/ ) is a good resource for that . 
  tracks censorship very well . 
  if nato had gone to war , tea partiers under bush ii would n't have gone all ' [ freedom fries ] ( http://orig01.deviantart.net/566e/f/2007/256/4/b/never_forget_freedom_fries_by_sexysexy.jpg ) ' business . 
  it 's a media blackout even on google news . 
  i 'm having trouble getting my head around this massive cover up . 
  it 's a mixed bag , overall . 
  just as with the criticism on both sides , sometimes it 's bigoted & sometimes not . 
  [ would you describe a leftist approach to economics as a subset of liberalism in general ? 
  ] ( http://media.makeameme.org/created/worst-genocide-ever.jpg ), 
  10,000 chf , fyi . 
  last time france called for a coalition iirc was under chiraq concerning lebanon . 
  i hope this effort is more robust all around . 
  no i 'm referring to saddam 's gassing of the kurds . 
  my apologies for the misinterpretation . 
  i do think that they had a plan , tho . 
  just that they 're criminally irresponsible fools to say the least . 
  i do n't remember the jewish terrorist attacks prior to wwii . 
  can you please elaborate ? 
  i 've already answered you above -- wallstr\u00f6m & l\u00f6fven both disagree with your position . 
  you sound angry . 
  stable countries do n't use mustard gas to massacre thousands of their citizens . 
  this anti-us party line is easy but lacking nuance to say the least . 
  from the article you may not have read :  swedish foreign minister margot wallstr\u00f6m told swedish public broadcaster svt that the decades-old israeli-palestinian conflict was a factor of radicalisation in the middle east . 
  a factor is a contributing cause , not an example . 
  also , the pm l\u00f6fven :  described her remarks as `` long and proper reasoning about what creates terrorism and that people are drawn to these movements . 
  it is not linked to criticism of israel . 
  it is a legitimate discussion . '', 
  ` creating terrorism ' means ` causing ' not ` an example of ' , and i 'm not sure why a party line trying to explain away wallstr\u00f6m 's comments disagrees with wallstr\u00f6m & the prime minister . 
  surely , one would hope that they know what they 're saying, 
   this is the dark side of globalization . 
  ach , i knew it was a class struggle , laddie !, 
  well that 's just spin doctoring there . 
  she was n't giving examples , she was attempting to give a cause and to the swedish popular view , much like the muslim world , ~ ~ da joos ~ ~ israel is to blame . 
  the cia knowing that the societies they want to fuck with are shit does n't exonerate those societies from being shit tho . 
  in other words , attacking daesh is not the answer but thinking about things is ? 
  even though the conclusion of attacking daesh is understood ? 
  then what is left to deliberate on please ? 
  my apologies . 
  deliberately doing nothing en masse . 
  ` peace in out time ' . 
   `` we '' have been at war with the people of the middle east for a very long time , killing them indiscriminately whenever we feel like it . 
  that 's actually quite hyperbolic . 
  as to ` war for a long time ' try the sunni/shia conflict . 
  as to ` indiscriminately ' , look to paris on friday . 
  moral equivalency is an effort in justification and ` they hate our freedom ' is a straw man . 
  personally , while i see the military industrial complex as a problem , it 's not a ` gang rape an entire ethnicity ' apocalyptic cult . 
  no moral equivalency there . 
  true , but other places do n't go full isis when they go to shit . 
  deliberation is n't mention anywhere in the article . 
  what is mentioned is the author 's wish that all western nations act in a united fashion & this :  canada withdrew from the air war after the election of justin trudeau . 
  * i desperately want france to do the same * , and rationality tells me it could happen . 
  that very much sounds as though he 's already made his decision as to what ought to be done ( nothing en masse ) . 
  funny enough , it was intimated to me yesterday in / r/ukpolitics that wwii actually started with the allied response to the invasion of poland . 
  this sort of revisionism seems to be a partisan view justifying no response now . 
  what else could a swedish politician say these days ? 
  i knew that i could find all the right answers in ` the anti-empire report ' / s, 
  does such reasoning go both ways for you ? 
  are attacks like paris also ` good enough reason for someone to go & { drop } a bomb somewhere to retaliate ' ? 
  what 's good for the goose is gravy for the gander , & if one can be excused then so can the other . 
  my friend ms. 
  basic reasoning . 
  please do n't be sorry  i think that zizek contradicts himself a few times in this article ( what else is new ? ), 
  but he does make some great points outside of his usual marxist spiel and far better points than he usually does . 
  my problem with marxism is that no one is going to convince a person of faith that their relationship with the creator takes a back seat to their membership in an economic class . 
  i 've never read a marxist argument trying to convince the faithful or any non-materialists to the marxist cause without boiling down to , `` you 're wrong , nothing you care about matters , be a marxist & * unite !,
