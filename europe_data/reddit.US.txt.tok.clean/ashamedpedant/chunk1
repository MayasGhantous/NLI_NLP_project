just a friendly note that although the word `` risible '' exists in english , it is not at all common . 
  normally one would use `` laughable '' or `` ludicrous '' . 
  sorry for going off topic . 
  [ here 's an ugly graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fzne4vi.png ) with more recent data . 
  no romania though . 
  ^ [ source ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=36499 ), 
   maybe that in the usa less people pretend to find a job , because of lower benefits that certainly sounds plausible to me . 
   do you get health insurance for pretending to find a job in the usa ? 
  generally no , but ` unemployment ' , ` food stamps ' , and ` welfare ' all have job search requirements . 
  that being said , because of time limits and weird requirements , our safety net programs are n't really a viable long term option for many people . 
  relying on family or a romantic partner is much more common . 
  there certainly has been a rebound , but ( imho ) u4 is n't the best measure . 
  people will tell themselves ( and pollsters ) that they do n't want a job , but they could be persuaded to work if wages were higher and jobs were easier to come by ( as often happens when the economy is booming ) . 
  [ this bls.gov page ] ( http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/lns12300060 ) graphs the seasonally adjusted percentage of 25-54 year-olds who are employed . 
  you can adjust the date range at the top , but please note that prior to the late-80s / early-90s the graph is mostly showing the [ scarcity of women ] ( http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_employment_population_25_54_men_women.jpg ) in the workforce . 
  i like that age range because unlike the raw job numbers / u/ekferti84x posted , it 's not influenced by retiring baby boomers or larger numbers of young people going to college . 
  i think the take away is that our job market is a lot healthier than it is in much of europe , but we still have a ways to go before we get back to where we were in the previous two * recessions * .

  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  oversimplified history : back in late 2006 , the iraq war was going horribly . 
  sunnis and shias were engaging in ( what many call ) a full blown civil war and al qaeda in iraq were blowing up american humvees left and right with ieds . 
  some of those devices used explosively formed perpetrators which could destroy the then-state-of-the-art up-armored m1114 hmmwvs . 
  ( even those with extra ` hillbilly ' / ` haji ' armor . ), 
  in 2004 , republicans had won the election on a support-our-troops mantra . 
  but 2 years later - given the situation in iraq and the aftermath of hurricane katrina - it was easy for democrats to portray the republicans in power as both incompetent and reckless with american lives . 
  in november , the republicans were given a shellacking and the democrats gained control of congress . 
  the very next day , bush announced he was getting rid of rumsfeld and replacing him with robert gates . 
  two months later he announced `` the surge '' and david petraeus was promoted and put in charge of the new strategy . 
  your guess that the mraps `` were the product of a senator with a military factory in their state '' is partially right . 
  lindsey graham ( r - s.c. ) did push hard for the acquisition of the mraps , and it did benefit a factory in his state . 
  the main supporters of the funding bill however were the democratic leadership ( including newly appointed senate foreign relations commiteee chair joe biden ) . 
  democrats saw mraps as a way to save lives , to prove their support-our-troops bone fides at a time when most of them opposed the surge , and to make the bush administration look foolish for not approving such a bill sooner . 
  ( win-win-win so long as you do n't care about the price tag . ), 
  some in the pentagon thought the money would be better used elsewhere , but bob gates and his head of procurement , john young , were consistently and loudly in favor of the mraps . 
  they probably would have bought a lot of them even without specially earmarked funding from congress . 
  for the record , ied casualties did drop dramatically around the time the mraps rolled in , but it 's hard to tell how much of that was the effect of better armor . 
  since overall violence fell rapidly during the same period .

  to clarify for anyone who 's confused , those protesters were anti-zionists . 
  interestingly , earlier this year there was a bill working its way through the israeli parliament to ban the use of word nazi as a casual insult . 
  the response among young people and leftists was to call the bill 's supporters nazis .

  you 're totally misunderstanding the article . 
  the boy died 24,000 years ago in eastern siberia , and `` his dna shows close ties to those of today 's native americans . '', 
  but his dna ** also ** shows other markers that are known to have originated in western asia/eastern europe . 
  up until now those results were thought to be totally contradictory . 
  if a modern native american had a gene profile like that , it would be assumed that the european genes must have entered the family post-columbus . 
  the truly shocking thing about the article is this line :  one expected relationship was missing from the picture : the boy 's genome showed no connection to modern east asians . 
  since we know that native americans are closely related to east asians , the only possible explanations are that either this study was seriously flawed in some way , or native americans descended from two separate groups ( one east asian and one west asian ) which mixed together thousands of years ago . 
  thank you for using the qualifier `` reported '' . 
  it 's a rare american who can tell you when and from where each of their family lines came to the united states . 
  if you know that one of your grandparents had a german last name , that 's more than sufficient in the us to claim german ancestry . 
  i 'd wager most of us are a lot more british than we ~ ~ realize ~ ~ realise .

  the idea of the trillion dollar coin was for the treasury ( read : government ) to give the federal reserve ( read : central bank ) the coin in exchange for a trillion dollars worth of treasury bonds . 
  the federal reserve owns [ $ 3.2 trillion in assets including $ 1.8 trillion in treasury bonds ] ( http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/ ) . 
  every day , as part of their [ open market operations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_market_operations ) , they buy and sell some of those bonds in order to control the money supply . 
  when they sell bonds , they take money from bond buyers and essentially destroy it ; the quantity of dollars in the market decreases . 
  so ordinarily when the federal reserve sells bonds , the effect is ** de ** flationary . 
  in this case , since they 're selling them to the treasury , the net effect is zero . 
  essentially , the government as a whole would be deciding that it owed * itself * less money . 
  even if this were not the case , the fed could still ' [ sterilize ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sterilization_\\ ( economics \\ ) ) ' an increase in the money supply by selling off assets in the open market . 
  notice i said ` coin ' singular . 
  if the government tried this trick multiple times , the fed would quickly run out of assets to sell . 
  as far as i know , that would leave them only one somewhat clumsy way to fulfill their mandate of controlling inflation : to raise the [ reserve requirement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reserve_requirement ) of private banks . 
  that 'd mean less lending available to everyone , which could conceivably lead to as nasty a doomsday scenario as the one described by the condescending puppet .

  i 'll use sweden as an example because it 's the country discussed in the article . 
  afaik the situation in other nordic countries is n't that different . 
  according to the table on [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_sweden ) page , sweden 's fertility rate was below the replacement rate in 42 of the last 44 years . 
  the consequences of that can be seen on page 456 of [ this ] ( http://europa.eu/epc/pdf/economic_and_budgetary_projections_for_the_27_eu_member_states__en.pdf ) eu report ( pdf ) . 
  they estimate that the percent of sweden 's population that 's 65 or older will grow from 18.3 % in 2010 to 23.5 % in 2035 . 
  meanwhile the prime age ( 25-64 ) population percentage will shrink from 39.1 % to 36.1 % . 
  that ratio of only about 1.5 workers for every retiree will likely put pressure on all sorts of government programs ( like healthcare ) , not just pension funds . 
  if it were n't for predicted immigration to sweden , along with the immigration of the last few decades ^ * , the demographic forecasts would look a lot worse . 
  especially since immigrants tend to have more children than native scandinavians . 
  sorry for the wall of text . 
  __ * sweden currently has [ more than 1.3 million ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_sweden ) foreign born inhabitants . 
  finally a devolved celtic country for the [ cornish nationalists ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornish_nationalism ) . 
  too bad it 's the wrong one . 
  the topic is hiding names from applications . 
  `` which means employers will have to invite many more people to interviews '' implies that looking at a person 's name is a valid way to judge if they have good interpersonal skills . 
  i was providing proof that it is n't . 
  yeah really , why even bother to interview people with weird ethnic names like ` hussein , ' ` barack , ' or ` obama ' when you just * know * that they are n't going to be able to appear decent , behave well , and talk fluently with clients . 
  this is all hypothetical of course , but assuming for the moment that irish banks had defaulted on their debts : creditor banks would have had to sell assets and/or curtail lending in order to shore up their balance sheets . 
  it 's the middle of the night over here , so maybe someone else can explain why widespread actions of that type can shrink the money supply , be deflationary or otherwise harm gdp . 
  at minimum an irish banking collapse would have put a damper on european gdp growth . 
  edit : i 'm going to bed , but if you 've not heard of [ fractional reserve banking ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fractional_reserve_banking ) , reading about it might help explain what i mean . 
  i oppose the death penalty , but i 'd like to point out that japan still has it as well . 
  then again , their [ entire justice system ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20080127x1.html ) is not what you 'd expect in a first world country .
