le chat , sur la table . 
  come on bro . 
  school in kiev ? 
  ukraine or elsewhere ? 
  preach brother . 
  i feel like the media induced ebola panic may finally be settling down , and not a moment too soon . . 
  i 've been following the ukraine crisis since last winter when i would wake up every morning and turn on the live stream from the maidan . 
  it 's not ending anytime soon . 
  we 're a nation of 300 million with a lot of idiots , some of them make it abroad , sorry . 
  guess i 'm an outlier . 
  i 've been to paris a couple times , but i 've spent most of my time traveling around the more eastern countries . 
  czech republic , poland , slovakia , hungary , croatia , bosnia , slovenia , lithuania , latvia , estonia , etc. 
  i love the east !, 
  screw the west ( and their high prices ! ), 
  well , you know they 've got the ` stans !, 
  do n't we all !, 
  disparity probably would 've been a better word choice . 
  all the better to keep you damn fascists out !, 
  i think you put too much faith in our steadfastness . 
  sure thing !, 
  do n't have plans to go back anytime soon though , but we could grab a brew . 
  sounds like the democrats and republicans . 
  dontcha love a two party system ? 
  hope and change , hope and change . 
  sounds like my kind of country . 
  ( i really enjoyed the few days i spent in vilnius . ), 
  as someone who spent 9 months living in the czech republic , took an elementary czech class , and lived with a czech roommate who spoke no english ... i was surprised at how similar czech , polish , and croatian were . 
  there 's a lot of overlap that made traveling in those countries a lot easier . 
  there 's always a relevant xkcd . 
   she noted : `` this [ the november vote ] is a contradiction to what russia said : ` no . 
  we do n't want a frozen conflict , another transniestria [ a russia-controlled de facto state in moldova ] . 
  we will respect the territorial integrity of ukraine ' . '' russia contradicting what they said ? 
  russia will respect the territorial integrity of ukraine ? 
  you ca n't make this shit up . 
  he definitely left his mark . 
  `` the gibraltar pound ( currency sign : # ; banking code : gip ) is the currency of gibraltar . 
  it is exchangeable with the british pound sterling at par value . '', 
  brilliant . 
  you should tape them to your shower curtain for easy reference in the future !, 
  a perfect example of where audio normalization would 've made this a lot more enjoyable . 
  still a very interesting clip . 
  i thought irish , icelandic , and finnish were the most unique sounding . 
  this should be the top answer . 
  please give this podcast a listen if you want to know the downside of the single currency and how germany disproportionally benefits at the expense of other nations . 
  you must be referring to \u010cesk\u00fd t\u011b\u0161\u00edn ? 
  walking across the border was great fun for me , but i was just traveling through of course . 
  russia 's got ta have their `` buffer zone . '', 
  will we see a 3peat ? 
  i 'd say we have a foot in a large portion of it . 
  i can guarantee that what we actually know is just the tip of the iceberg . 
  it was n't long ago that people who said the nsa is tapped into all our communications were called crazy tin foil hatters . 
  there 's a lot to be skeptical about , but there 's also a lot to say there may be some truth to them .

  all credit to those guys . 
  not really , they just did n't come into power . 
  there were still plenty of conservatives in the 60s and 70s , and they are the ones in power . 
  ... amen ? 
  i prefer iron man , nothing religious about a billionaire playboy in a weaponized armored suit . 
  and i care about both the czech republic and poland !, 
  love your countries . 
  i tried when i was in tallinn , was not successful . 
  :( i had to imagine that finland was just over there . 
  all aboard the train train !, 
  are n't you guys controlled by denmark or something ? 
  relevant username . 
  i was n't implying that there is no one named ladislaus in the us , i would be surprised if there was n't . 
  just saying that i 've found the more traditional spelling of laszlo to be more common . 
  just as an anecdote , i 've known quite a few people named laszlo in the us , never heard of anyone named ladislaus . 
  quite a mouthful . 
  it was spontaneous in the sense that it would not have happened had yanukovych not been deposed . 
  as soon as he fled and the country had no official leader putin capitalized and took crimea . 
  lol , you ca n't just remove the barrel on an ak . 
  it is drilled and pinned in place . 
  this is absolutely standard procedure for checking cleanliness . 
  there is zero chance of an accident occurring with the bolt carrier , magazine , and gas tube removed . 
  what are they gon na do ? 
  quit ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  i 'm all for govt assistance when needed but that is ridiculous . 
  haha this is awesome , thanks !, 
  i 'm trying to imagine a dutch or german sounding snape ... it 's not working out too well . 
  reality plays no role in their reasoning . 
  interesting !, 
  i figured the vast majority of homes would have a hardline running to them . 
  seems like a good time to be a propane bottle exporter . 
  to fight the fascists . 
  could you buy bottled propane and use a camp stove or something ? 
  ca n't help but agree . 
  or estonia , latvia , and lithuania . 
  da fuck is that all about ? 
  they have to fight the fascists !, 
  fascists everywhere but russia !, 
  i 'm halfway around the world and i feel your anger man . 
  i was in riga two years ago and i 'll never forget a conversation i had with the owner of the hostel i was staying in . 
  she was saying how she was still afraid of russia and them invading , and i could n't believe it . 
  i said `` how could that happen ?
