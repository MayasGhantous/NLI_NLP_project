  get it , everybody ? 
  get it ? '', 
  easy , buddy . 
  you need to spend more time in nord-pas de calais , then . 
  agreed . 
  it seems that the author has a hard time separating the breakup from the war and genocide . 
   belgian , i 'm afraid , and the beer is american , but invented by a german . 
  eh , they 're all the same !, 
  ( in all seriousness , why did i think inbev was from the netherlands ? 
  i 'm usually much more on top of things than that . 
  ones that you can get in germany ... 
  i 'm not sure . 
  i found [ this forum thread on the topic at beer advocate ] ( http://beeradvocate.com/community/threads/american-craft-breweries-that-distribute-to-europe.46752/#post-605478 ) . 
  from the comment i linked there , i can recommend most of flying dog 's offerings , victory 's ipa , and sierra nevada 's ipa . 
  the best american beers come from michigan , but most are n't even distributed outside of the american midwest . 
  if you can get your hands on anything by short 's ( more experimental american ales ; i 'm drinking [ an ale with dill , horseradish , peppercorn , and celery seed ] ( http://www.shortsbrewing.com/beer/our-portfolio/specialty-beers/bloody-beer/?iamlegal=1 ) at the moment ) or jolly pumpkin ( belgian style ales , including lambics ) , those are the gold standard in my book . 
  short of that , bell 's brewery makes solid beers , and they are a much larger brewer ( i.e. 
  more likely to be found outside of my region ) . 
  hope that helps ( and that i stopped myself before going overboard ) !, 
  ** e.t.a. 
  : ** i assume that you prefer lagers to ales , so , in the event that you ever come to michigan , do yourself a favor and go to [ wolverine state brewing company ] ( http://wolverinebeer.com/the-lagers/ ) . 
  they specialize in lagers , which is something of a rarity among american craft brewers . 
  how dare you . 
  do n't criticize what you do n't know . 
  also , keep in mind that budweiser is made by a ~ ~ dutch ~ ~ belgian company . 
  actual american beer is of the craft sort , and it is the best in the world . 
  thanks . 
  it 's good to know that hr fluff is a common practice elsewhere , too , for when i do start applying for jobs in europe . 
  nice . 
  if i were looking , able to move to finland right now , and fluent in finnish , i might apply for some of those . 
  are you looking , or are you making a point about worthwhile educational fields to pursue ? 
  that 's what unites us across the pond . 
  it can ( like ` schmuck ' ... oh , wait , that 's what the american copy used ) , as in the saying & laquo ; trop bon , trop con & raquo ; , but it 's flexible \\* . 
  i do n't think this cover is going for that angle , though . 
  \\* just like ` asshole ' , really . 
  `` what an asshole '' could be inspired by somebody who does something mean-spirited or something stupid . 
  to me , * con * is much more like ` asshole ' , a nominally bad word that can be used in situations where other profanities would not fly . 
  thus :  fuck off , you rich asshole . 
  true . 
  kookie can usually be dissuaded . 
  corrupt is a lost cause . 
  that would certainly do a better job of capturing the negative externalities that the u.s. creates . 
  i do n't know about jill stein , though . 
  reading through some of her positions made her seem a little kookie . 
  of course , the same is true of gary johnson . 
  perhaps there could be a hybrid ( jill johnson ? ), 
  of them to unite the forgotten parties . 
  in addition to / u/eurotreasure 's comment , social security is a program specifically for retirees and those with certain disabilities . 
  welfare programs for the general public are separate . 
  \\* ding ding ding \\* there should be more people like us in the states . 
  yes !, 
  ghent is my favorite city . 
  i have n't lived there , so my opinion is only so valuable , but the rationale behind it would be : * beautiful center city with a belfry , two large , beautiful cathedrals , and a focus on walkability * good food , beer , chocolate , fries , etc. 
  * progressive attitude ( including thursday veggie-day , which this vegetarian loves ) * strong museums with interesting exhibits ( i saw an excellent one on jacques tati while i was there ) * bike lanes , excellent public transportation ( tram and bus system ) , and the aforementioned walkability * easy transport to other cities ( 30 minutes by train to brussels , for example ) * solid university presence that does n't seem to take over the town * overshadowed by bruges , brussels , and antwerp when it comes to tourism , which makes it feel like a city rather than a tourist destination, 
  i did n't claim that it 's the same , but it absolutely is a measure of competitiveness : it is the means by which skilled people in one economic class are able to take advantage of those skills to move into another . 
  this is similar to how new firms are able to acquire market space for themselves by doing something better than established firms . 
  a competitive economy depends on an efficient usage of resources , and social mobility is a measure of that in the labor market . 
  yeah , like some dane would know anything about * competitiveness * . 
  it 's not like your society is more socially mobile than ours . 
  ... oh , wait , it is ? 
  hm , well , then . 
  greenland would be ours if we wanted it . 
  the single market and the open labor market ( barring practical restrictions with languages ) . 
  do n't ~ ~ confuse ~ ~ let the euro 's difficulties ~ ~ with ~ ~ blind you to the power of that market . 
  ** e.t.a. 
  : ** fixed my baffling syntax . 
  you 're conflating american companies and individuals with the us government . 
  they are not the same thing . 
  we 're talking about imports and exports bought and sold by the former , not the latter . 
  the debt is on behalf of the us federal reserve , not of the companies and individuals buying goods . 
  that 's an important distinction . 
  not exactly . 
  eu companies buy that oil from the source in saudi arabia or russia or wherever . 
  that the market operates in usd does not mean that an american firm or individual has to be involved . 
  of course , concerns about the [ ` exorbitant privilege ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exorbitant_privilege ) that the us gains from having the reserve currency have been around for a long time , but it 's also worth noting that this opens the us up to insecurity as other countries ' central banks have the ability to flood the global market with usd if they so desired . 
  those same places that are happy to sit on stockpiles of usd ( e.g. , russia , china ) would have that option if another currency were capable of taking the dollar 's place ( or had a central bank willing to , in the case of the euro ) . 
  at bottom , though , it 's not the eu that is gifting anything to the us because of the trade imbalance , as the eu 's trade deficit with china surpasses the us 's with the eu by us$ 96 billion ( [ us$ 169b vs. us$ 73b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_european_union ) ) . 
  well , for one , that trade happens in both usd and euro , hence the strength of the euro against the dollar . 
  beyond that , though , the global oil trade uses usd , so those eu companies take the dollars that they bring in from exports and either use them to buy the oil that they need or sell them to companies that do . 
  alright . 
  a trade imbalance simply represents a net difference in trade . 
  in this case , the eu exports more goods to the us than the us does to the eu . 
  that 's the trade imbalance . 
  now , the eu companies responsible for those exports are still being paid for all of those goods that they send to the us . 
  likewise with us companies exporting to europe . 
  thus , there is nothing free or donated here : these are just aggregate transactions and the difference between the two . 
  where the money comes from is another question entirely . 
  the us is also trading with canada , mexico , china , african countries , south american countries , australia , etc. 
  now , you 'll notice that [ the us has net negative trade imbalances with a lot of its biggest partners ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_united_states ) . 
  since that is the case , where does that extra money come from ? 
  a few of the primary options : individual borrowing ( this is different from the government 's borrowing ) , government subsidies , and domestic production . 
  that 's not really important here , though . 
  a * politically strategic * immature child . 
  the embargo is still on because of the wealthy cuban population in southern florida , many of whose families left as castro deposed batista . 
  probably about the same time that the us stops protecting trade routes and providing missile defense around the world free of charge . 
  ** e.t.a. 
  : ** i 'm not some jingoistic , nationalistic american who likes to brag about the us military-industrial complex . 
  i do n't mean this to suggest that the world give the us a break . 
  the truth , though , is that a lot of other countries benefit from us imperialistic tendencies , and trade routes and missile defense are the two most prominent and important examples . 
  not sure if joking , or lacking any understanding of what a trade imbalance actually means .
