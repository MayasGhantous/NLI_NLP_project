i discovered erkin koray a few years ago . 
  my favorite is definitely [ g\u00f6kteki y\u0131ld\u0131zlar . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/hawhryfuptu ), 
  just in case this needs pointing out , what americans call `` jelly '' is basically just jam . 
  hopefully you 're not thinking we eat peanut butter with [ * this * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wtojkst.jpg ) , which we call jello or gelatin but * never * `` jelly . '', 
  mapfrappe : [ greenland ] ( http://mapfrappe.com/?show=1078 ) and [ russia . 
  ] ( http://mapfrappe.com/?show=1078 ) drag the comparison map around . 
  this looks like it was made with [ mapfrappe , ] ( http://mapfrappe.com/ ) which shows mercator but does rescale the outlines you draw as you change their latitude . 
  jeremy clarkson hosted [ a bbc documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-0nxos4udy ) on the arctic convoys to arkhangelsk . 
  it 's pretty good . 
  the / r/topgear thread was specifically linking to [ the `` handbrake turn '' part ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-0nxos4udy&amp;t=893 ) but i ended up watching the whole thing ( and so did a lot of other people , judging by the comments ) . 
  the oregon/california border is the 42nd parallel , which passes just north of rome . 
  there are also bits of turkey that are farther north . 
  crazy . 
  the big one for english-speakers learning spanish is that `` embarazada '' does n't mean `` embarrassed , '' it means `` pregnant . '', 
  and picking the wrong one can completely change the word . 
  i 'm not sure of any that are the same part of speech though , so it 's not really a big deal . 
  the [ thigh ] ( http://forvo.com/word/thigh/#en ) ( unvoiced ) is the upper part of the leg ; [ thy ] ( http://forvo.com/word/thy/#en ) ( voiced ) is an old word for `` your . '', 
  the [ mouth ] ( http://forvo.com/word/mouth/#en ) ( unvoiced ) is a hole in your face ; to [ mouth ] ( http://www.forvo.com/word/mouths/#en ) ( voiced ( does that count as irony ? ) ), 
  is to move your mouth like you 're speaking without actually making sound . 
  i could n't find the verb one but the plural of the noun is voiced so that 's what i linked . 
  [ teeth ] ( http://www.forvo.com/word/teeth/#en ) ( unvoiced ) are the white things in your mouth ; to [ teethe ] ( http://www.forvo.com/word/teethe/#en ) ( voiced ) is to grow teeth . 
  an [ ether ] ( http://www.forvo.com/word/ether/#en ) ( unvoiced ) is an organic compound ( among other things ) ; [ either ] ( http://www.forvo.com/word/either/#en ) ( voiced ) means `` one or the other of two . '', 
  a lot of the buildings at my university ( in california ) were built or designed in the 70s . 
  concrete brutalist buildings everywhere . 
  sounds like what happens when you want bucharest [ but you get budapest . 
  ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/atheltic-bilbao-fans-arrived-at-budapest-829834 ), 
  i think the market crashed a few days ago . 
  as soon as i saw these in / r/mapporn * and * here , `` oh no . 
  here we go . '', 
  yeah , i was n't sure if you were just speaking generally . 
  this election can only become more of a circus . 
  trump is n't running against sanders at this point . 
  they 're both still just trying to get the nomination from their own parties . 
  has to be left out because of the state . 
  my first autocomplete was `` why is georgia called the peach state ? '', 
  i like the ones that [ split things up real fine ] ( http://cdn-images.9cloud.us/500/languages_and_dialects_of_europe_21_670481648.png ) more than ones that lump countries together into some monolithic uniform language . 
  my german class had a student teacher from somewhere outside stuttgart . 
  i do n't know how intelligible schw\u00e4bisch is to most germans , but when we got her to slip fully into whatever she spoke growing up ( i assume it was some sort of schw\u00e4bisch ) , i went from `` yeah okay i 'm pretty sure i got most of that '' to `` wat . '', 
  glad to see the bird one . 
  i ca n't stand people who feed the fucking seagulls . 
  sometimes they do it from their cars which means they 're the only ones not at risk of getting shit on . 
  bold move bringing up americans in this context in / r/europe . 
  i 'll grab the popcorn . 
  edit : whoa hold on , i was too tired last night to notice you made this into some sort of personality test . 
  come on dude lmao . 
  it looks like what the / r/dataisbeautiful guy did is a little out of my skill set . 
  i 've been hoping to find something comparable to [ streamer ] ( http://water.usgs.gov/streamer/web/ ) for europe for a while . 
  [ i can dig it . 
  am\u00e9rica is n't the same thing as america . 
  it depends on which [ continent model ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continent#number_of_continents ) you use , which tends to depend on [ which language you speak . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvmzc4y4zxu ) in most of the english-speaking world , am\u00e9rica is referred to as `` the americas '' or `` north and south america . '', 
  / u/zaungast 's continent model has canada in north america so what he said is fine . 
  also , the us is the only country with `` america '' in its name . 
  going from southern california to illinois can be pretty shocking . 
  i usually have to remind myself that the `` dae amerifat '' posts are n't exaggerating ; other parts of the country just drag the average up . 
  i think i 'll keep west of the rockies . 
  do n't forget `` i 'm thousands of kilometers and a very expensive plane ride from any country that speaks anything but spanish . '', 
  i learned enough spanish in school to get by in southern california , and it does n't take much . 
  definitely aware that the german and the bit of norwegian i learned were mostly for funsies . 
  i did n't know it meant `` world '' before this thread , but i 'm pretty amazed i was able to see `` maailma '' and think [ `` hey i recognize that ... '' ] ( https://youtu.be/ezkcyykkwua ), 
  yep . 
  `` eye-rack '' is n't a country ; it 's what i do at the beach . 
  [ start here !, 
  ] ( https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en.html ) lol good luck !, 
  did n't expect the basque word to match anything . 
  the ta in one of my german classes was from that area . 
  when we got her to lapse into schw\u00e4bisch , i went from `` i 'm pretty sure i got most of that '' to `` wat . '', 
  no way . 
  it 's not within sight of another starbucks . 
  i grew up and went to a university in areas that always had mountains to the east . 
  i get completely turned around when i 'm in the pancake-flat midwest . 
  it 's really unsettling to find out that a road you were * positive * went north ( it did n't point at any mountains so it 's obviously not east ) actually does go east . 
  it 's fun to mentally switch to using the sun in unfamiliar areas . 
  also , the difference between afsluitdijk and afsluitdijk is the difference between looking like a mashed keyboard or a name . 
  dutch name if you notice the - ij - hiding in there . 
  honest question : regarding number 3 , [ how is this different ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mz0nn/poland_moves_to_take_in_ethnic_poles_from_former/ ) ( apart from the circumstances of how they left poland ) are they all polish-speaking polish citizens ? 
  i would have expected theirs to be older but apparently [ it 's not . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_brittany ), 
  there is n't really a bad time to come here . 
  [ this was nye at san clemente . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7d0qsb2.jpg ) i was at balboa so often last winter i pretty much lived there . 
  as someone who goes to the beach for new year 's , is this a normal time of year to start snowing ? 
  i 'm most used to how people around frankfurt sound . 
  the north sounds posh as fuck and berliners sound like what you 'd get if you taught a bear to speak . 
  i feel compelled to read subtitles when they 're on . 
  this is obviously not a problem when the actors are n't speaking english , but it happens even when they are . 
  i do n't miss anything without them , i just * have * to read them if they 're there . 
  there 's no problem if they 've always been off but * turning * them off almost leaves me feeling naked . 
  [ california knows a thing or two about wine . 
  ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/05/24/479163882/the-judgment-of-paris-the-blind-taste-test-that-decanted-the-wine-world ) come out to napa or the central coast sometime . 
  and northeasterners alone are n't the only americans but that does n't stop you from calling all of us `` yanks . '', 
  jesus i did n't know anyone sold crustless bread . 
  well son of a bitch . 
  fair enough . 
  i do n't like chocolate all that much so i 've never gone looking . 
  the only chocolate i 've ever really liked was cadbury . 
  have you tried all of our chocolate , or just hershey 's ? 
  because that 'd be like walking into a bar , ordering a bud light , and then calling american beer awful .
