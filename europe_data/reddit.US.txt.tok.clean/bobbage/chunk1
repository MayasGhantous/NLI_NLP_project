i obviously agree with you that muslims are n't devils like most people here believe they are that 's all the point i 'm trying to make , honestly i have no particular love for islam or indeed any other religion , i am atheist myself and think they are all a net negative , just saying do n't reject these people simply * because * they 're muslims there is nothing particularly more wrong with muslims than anyone else , we are all human beans at the end of the day and given the right opportunities like in america can do great things and contribute to the country 's they immigrate too, 
  their father 's were muslim it 's all about the next generation they 're the future, 
  they 're not quite the same thing , compare southern ireland and spain for example , ireland is much higher in terms of gdp because most american company 's are headquartered there but actual incomes are higher in northern spain, 
  yes , america , the land of the free and the brave and of unlimited opportunities if only you stand up and take them what other country could these young bastards of muslim father 's purely through they 're hard work and force of we 'll work their way to the highest offices both politically and in business in the land not even just the land , the highest offices in the world , a young black muslim kid without a father ended up leader of the free world and the son of a syrian refugee went on to create the greatest corporation the world has ever known google was also founded by an immigrant , incidentally , of the other great non christian abrahamic religion , and just look at microsoft and google now both run by indian immigrants while they could not succeed and were rejected by the racist uk in the 1960s and 70s we took them in , close to our bosom and made them our own and it is america that reaps the benefit of this open , welcoming and non racist immigration policy just saying, 
  yeah , i did n't want to say it , but this is important to us interests , someone might be needing a bit of liberatin ' if this looks like it is going the wrong way, 
  this is worrying , i think obama needs to take a stronger tone on this and the consequences threaten to move the us embassy to paris maybe and all the banks to frankfurt, 
  i 'd say millions of people and being the hub for the entire country 's economy are more significant to be honest, 
  jobs was adopted as his bio mother 's family objected to her marrying a muslim , she did n't raise him obama 's father faced the same racism which was prevalent in the us at the time , i 'm sad to say , it 's good that we have been able to grow up as a nation and have moved past that now, 
  i would n't think so , i do n't think you 'd say canberra was the most important in australia or ottawa was the most important in canada if you were going to completely destroy a one or other i think completely taking out sydney would have more of an impact, 
  yes but not in switzerland that 's the point you need a permit to open carry a handgun in switzerland and it is virtually impossible to get unless you are police or a security guard concealed carry is n't a thing at all guns you legally own can only be transported unloaded , directly to where you need to use them ( barracks , firing range ) this is the point , american gun nuts often point to switzerland as an example of a country in europe with lots of guns and a supposedly similar gun culture but it 's nothing like it , it 's very restrictive swiss gun laws in the us i 'd be very happy with, 
  it 's the us and eu that have sanctions on them , i do n't believe their neighbours give much of a shit most of their trade is with china and south africa and i believe the stuff they send to china goes through the port of beira in mozambique which is only a few hundred km from the zimbabwean border a lot of the stuff the export ( gold , diamonds ) is pretty compact too , you could stick it on a plane, 
  as of april 15 , 2016 , alaska , arizona , arkansas [ disputed ] , idaho ( effective july 1 , 2016 ; residents only ) , kansas , maine , mississippi , puerto rico [ disputed ] , vermont , west virginia ( effective june 5 , 2016 ) [ 5 ] andwyoming ( residents only ) do not require a permit to carry a concealed firearm for any person of age ( usually 21 and older ) who is not prohibited from owning a firearm . 
  yeah it was a bit of a well established convention since washington and jefferson that presidents limit themselves to two terms , roosevelt only went for the third as war was looming and he rigged up a stunt at the convention that he proclaimed he did n't want it but had planted people who would `` demand '' that he run oh well if i * have * to, 
  i think europe could learn from this , how muslim immigration can actually be a good thing one of the best presidents of the greatest country in the world , muslim immigrant father , check steve jobs , founder of the largest company in the world that has revolutionized everything , biological father was a muslim political refugee from syria look what he did maybe one of these migrants will grow up to become a syrian angela merkel or create something genuinely useful like a space elevator or a colony on mars mining space or something in america we embrace diversity , different ways of thinking , and sometimes something truly great comes from it just some positive thoughts for a change from this ignorant american edit : immediate downvotes for suggesting anything can possibly be good about muslim immigrants ... 
  but to be expected i guess from / r/europe ( an ) i 'm just glad in america we still have actual true progressives like bernie sanders and even hillary ( her chief of staff , huma abadein is muslim ) europe of course has always been more racist than us , a nation of immigrants , i thought you guys might be getting better but it seems you are only getting worse sad, 
  well the head is the smaller bit, 
  it 's because russia has always had a different personality and focus , they do n't even teach europe as a distinct continent but rather eurasia as that 's their broader focus ultimately what is european is very arbitrary , in some ways yes it is but in other ways no it 's not in modern europe democracy and respect for human rights are core values and russia does n't share these or apparently much desire to acquire them this is a very big cultural difference in this regard i think it is more reasonable to consider turkey as our nato ally european than russia who are very much opposed to everything the rest of europe and america holds dear and yes turkey also has issues i do n't dispute that but at least it allies with the united states and freedom rather than russia and autocracy ( issues with erdogan aside ), 
  yes because you 're a developing country but as you develop you can automate more of your agriculture and people can work more in other jobs in other sectors france is the largest agricultural producer in the eu and only 3 % of its population work in farming the netherlands is the second largest agricultural exporter * in the world * and it only has 2 % working in it 's highly technological highly intensive agricultural sector, 
  the language used in america is english and the rest of the continent spanish and portuguese , does that make us european ? 
  what about half of africa that speaks french or english ? 
  is that european ? 
  australia , singapore , east timor , india ... all european countries now ? 
   the data ca n't be used to identify individual patients . 
  `` no patient-identifiable data is shared with deepmind , '' a spokeswoman for the royal free nhs trust told cnet . 
  it seems to suggest that bundles apply eu wide now with the surcharge on top  so if you make a five-minute call from madrid to manchester , five minutes of your calls allowance is used , plus you pay the top-up rate of 4.4 p a minute -- a total 22p to the uk operator . 
  from next year the surcharge is gone and bundles have to apply eu wide , they ca n't be national i presume that includes data but a `` free calls to giff gaff '' could still be just free to giff gaff if they do n't operate in other country 's, 
  this is the really big change , from next year , extra charges have to be gone entirely  the eu announced in october last year that it will ban these charges from june 2017 . 
  monthly call allowances will then apply across the eu as if the user were in their home country . 
  maybe we could kill everyone at age 70 ? 
  give them five years of retirement and then the chop rich people would be exempt of course, 
   most people will agree that there are too many people on earth . 
  a lot of people disagree with that actually , it 's outdated thinking from the seventies and whatever about population growth in the developing world ( and even that is arguable , quality of life and economic development has been increasing there along with the growth ) it 's certainly not a problem even remotely in the west population decline in western countries is nothing but a problem, 
  this is true but how many are never planning on going back, 
  british are an island off the coast of europe , they 're a sort of in between type place like russia and turkey one foot in , one foot out afraid to get too attached, 
  not entirely sure someone with israel in their flair should be saying they `` attained their morsel of land 500 years ago '' as some sort of question over their legitimacy that 's sort of exactly the sort of thinking that kicked off ww2 , the `` rightful reunification of historical german lands '' and lebensraum and all that, 
  yeah we should kick out cyprus, 
  like the word country the word america has different meanings, 
  istanbul is still by far the most important city , by far the largest , the business , financial and trade capital , etc istanbul alone is a third of turkey 's gdp and handles 60 % of turkey 's trade, 
  russia is n't culturally european though, 
  they 're different values , at the end of the day they 're muslim and religious and muslim and religious people are not going to approve of homosexuality and unmarried cohabitation it 's not just muslims either , if you poll conservative christians or mormons in us you will get very similar numbers on approval of homosexuality and premarital sex , from a quick check mormons are actually more against the latter than turks are ( 77 % vs 64 % ) adultery is actually straight up illegal in almost half of us states , while is virtually mandatory in france ... different values not all that long ago most of europe was like this as well , this acceptance of homosexuality and premarital sex is very very recent if you can get people away from their attachment to religion , that 's when you 'll see an evolution on these values , it only happened in most of europe over the last generation or two, 
  you are the one who has fixated on `` muslim '' , i only added that as an afterthought , the main lineages i described were `` mediterranean '' ( ie spanish/portuguese ) and the natives latin america in general is mostly mixed , far more than the us , it 's mostly a mix of native american and european i 'm by no means suggesting that is the main reason or even that it 's all about genetics in the first place but these people are descended from a mix of bloodthirsty conquistadors hell bent in eradicating the native population and only whatever natives were strong enough to survive and resist that onslaught natives who were also predisposed to human sacrifice and unimaginable cruelty mix that together and you 've got a powder keg and again not focusing on muslims you are the one focusing on muslims but they were a significant part of spain/portugal at the time and yes they did go to america like any other iberian but not the focus , you have jumped on muslim for some reason when i 'm primarily talking about the other two groups shakira turned out alright and again no i 'm not saying it 's all genetics , culture definitely plays a role but the entire americas have a frontier culture where the migrants coming in had to physically fight and subdue ( and in the case of latin america seduce ) the natives and lived in isolated frontier communities with little centralization and rule of law compared with the old world and that goes for the united states as well , we 're not as violent as latin america but were a lot more violent than other developed countries as violence and a healthy murder rate are the sign of a free country, 
  they were sort of different, 
  it is yes , there are some federal regulations but it 's mostly left to the states, 
  how many times each year do you shoot someone ? 
  how many times do you get shot ? 
  it 's really strange , i 'm american myself but most years i actually manage to get through the 12 months without getting shot and without a gun to `` protect '' myself besides most gun regulation in america is left to the states and the individual states are smaller than european country 's, 
  an ordinary italian citizen can concealed carry a loaded handgun in public legally ? 
  without having a good reason like being police or a security person ? 
   eu regulations are fu * ked anyhow . 
  i can be a p.i. 
  and have a gun permit for 20 years but when i quit the job or close down my business i lose my gun permit ( as it was tied with my job ) and as a regular citizen with experience handling guns i ca n't apply . 
  i think the logic there is if you 're not doing the job you do n't need it any more so why should you have one makes sense to me also i 'm pretty sure guns are regulated in the eu on a state level not a eu level same in the states for the most part, 
  can you carry a loaded , concealed handgun in public legally in switzerland ready to shoot anyone who might cross you because that 's a major part of gun rights in america and i believe the answer is no , what are you nuts of course not in switzerland several american states you can carry a loaded , concealed handgun in public without even needing to apply for a permit , any nut can do so, 
  i believe it 's basically impossible to get a license to carry a handgun in switzerland unless you are police or a bank security officer carrying very large amounts of cash and concealed carry i believe is totally illegal, 
  the iberian peninsula was predominantly muslim for almost a millennium https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-andalus and no they did n't all just disappear with the * reqonquista * in 1492 , they mixed , they 're genetic legacy is still there today  the most recent study regarding african admixture in iberian populations was conducted in april 2013 by botigu\u00e9 et al. 
  using genome-wide snp data for over 2000 individuals , concluding that ** spain and portugal hold significantly higher levels of north african than the rest of the european continent ** . 
  estimates of shared ancestry averaged between 4 and 20 % whereas these did not exceed 2 % in other western or southern european populations . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_history_of_the_iberian_peninsula#north_african_influence https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3718088/ and they also went to america  due to spanish authorities ' preoccupations with spreading religious orthodoxy , moriscos or iberian muslims , many of whom had been forcibly baptized at the beginning of the sixteenth century , were prohibited from settling in spanish america . 
  but these laws , like so many others during the period , were not fully enforced . 
  ...  my research questions the category of spaniard in similarly rigorous ways , troubling its implication of an `` old christian '' who possessed purity of blood and formed part of a unified catholic society . 
  ** i demonstrate that the presence of moriscos and muslims in the spanish americas ** , as well as the circulation of knowledge about them , complicates notions of what it meant to be a spaniard and part of an early modern spanish world . 
  yeah the rest of latin america is even more violent than greenland , i think it 's that hot mediterranean blood mixed with all that human sacrifice that does it maybe a bit of genetic militant islam in there as well , the spanish were basically muslim in that time period, 
  it 's violent yea nothing to do but drink and everyone gets depressed with the weather and lack of sunlight and then hans hansen 's son hans makes a disparaging comment about peter petersen 's father peter and it all kicks off and ends in disaster most of the murders there are alcohol related greenland 's part of america but is n't the us or canada so i presumed it was latin american no , the part of america where do n't speak english, 
  i 'd be very very happy if the us recognized that was the meaning of the second amendment ( a well regulated militia ) and introduced swiss-style gun laws i have no issue with the 2nd amendment protecting a `` well regulated militia '' run by the state handguns would be effectively made illegal unless you had a very good defined reason like being a security guard concealed carry illegal carrying a loaded gun in public , illegal , guns must be transported unloaded and separated from the ammunition transport in public only allowed directly between the home and the place where the gun is to be used ( barracks , shooting range , etc ) - even stopping at a shop to buy a soda on the way is illegal if you have your gun with you military issue rifles with strict regulations as to storage ( locked cabinet in the home ) and transport ( unloaded ) and ammunition typically not issued to the owners but kept in the municipal armory that all sounds great to me as a gun control advocate , you 'd be happy with all of that ? 
  do n't know about the others but it is virtually impossible to get a license to carry a handgun in switzerland , you need to have a very good defined reason ( such as being employed as a security officer transporting cash between banks ) and there are only a few thousand licenses in the entire country guns for the army or hunting are a very different situation, 
  because that would be socialism, 
  no , they 're not the three poorest states are mississippi , west virginia and arkansas looking at your wiki list for overall murders excluding dc  mississippi 8th , arkansas 20th , west virginia 32nd for gun murders  mississippi 7th , arkansas 16th , west virginia 34th lowest 25th percentile out of 50 states would be positions 39-50 none of the poorest three states are in the bottom 25 % for either murders or gun murders it 's also worth noting that all three are amongst the most rural , if they were more urban you would expect the number to be higher https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization_in_the_united_states, 
  and in america ? 
  japanese and chinese culture is very different , our culture is highly individualistic and places an emphasis on individual freedom and aggressive competition while theirs places more emphasis on harmony , social cohesion , deference to authority and knowing your place very different cultures i could as well point to latin america which is far more violent again than we are , look at mexico , brazil , greenland , honduras , venezuela , places like that, 
  he 's trying to oppress it in the netherlands and germany as well by pressuring their governments to use archaic laws to prosecute people who `` insult '' him and hanging the refugee crisis over heads as encouragement, 
  or japan , or canada , or spain and russia is n't a healthy democracy or a strong economy but they do actually have a strong army, 
  pretty much yea http://www.earlyvegas.com/early_vegas/up_eiffel_tower.jpg, 
  yeah it 's residents not just citizens , but you would need something like your visa proving that you were resident in the eu, 
  everyone, 
  they often actually detect it specifically using javascript and only put the replacement there if changes to the page made by an ad blocker are detected, 
  you could , by some good awful javascript/css hacks but you are just basically recreating a cookie manually , it has all the same privacy implications for the user , it just requires work for you to put this stuff all over your code rather than just setting a cookie so it 's a load of work but it 's not ultimately any better from the user perspective , it does n't address any of the privacy issues with cookies there 's no particular limit to the amount of data you could shuttle around with this method either , if anything you could probably store more in it than a cookie but session id is all you need on the client side , you can keep everything else you want on the server side if it 's a first party cookie it can only be read by the site that sends it anyway as someone else said , they should have pressed for better cookie management in browsers rather than this half baked solution, 
   if they run a script to check if the ads have been loaded they would already be in compliance with the law that is how it works  but it would unjustly punish people with slow net connections as the script might run faster then the ads load . 
  that 's not a problem , ad blockers work by rewriting the actual page to remove or hide ads and they just check for the changes made by the typical blockers they do n't have to check for the actual ad image, 
  that forbes thought of the day bullshit makes me want to go shoot up a mall, 
  that 's illegal you should sue, 
  eh , of course it does you could as easily decide instead of just putting the message there making it full screen to obscure all of the page , or redirect to another page telling you to turn it off , or ping back to the server with javascript to log it or any number of other things, 
  the only one that i can think of that actively prevents me reading the webpage is forbes most give a plea to white list but obviously they can detect it , and if they can detect it it 's up to them what they actually do about it, 
  you can use post for the login , sure , but you are still going to need to add a url parameter to any link you have to keep the session going but the point is , whatever way you do it , you are basically doing the exact same thing , getting the client to send a session id with each http request whether that session id comes in the form of a cookie , a url parameter or a posted form field makes absolutely no difference from a user privacy point of view , the cookie is just the neatest way to handle it, 
   the only way cookies could potentially give away your identity is if you visit sites partnered with a big ad platform that 's virtually every site out there even sites that do n't have ads commonly use google analytics , it 's not all or even primarily about ad serving, 
   or do you prefer the current situation ( in which it 's pretty much impossible to block any ad blocker ) ? 
  how is it impossible i get `` we see yore using an ad blocker '' all the time, 
  you basically do , though , or you have to use something else like a url parameter which is functionally the same just more messy and insecure, 
  it was but the web standards body ( w3c ) , still led by tim berners-lee , is currently headquartered in the united states , in ma the ietf is also american , based in california, 
  it does , yes , i mean where do you draw the line , i do n't see how you could argue that `` whether you have an ad blocker installed '' is personal information is a browser user agent personal information then , it gives details of what browser , os etc you are using ridiculous, 
  there 's a lot of very mainstream sites doing it , most still show you the page but include a plea to whitelist them , but some like forbes wo n't let you see the content until you disable your ad blocker, 
  i think the long term plan is to saw you off at the border and float you out into the atlanric, 
  under the radar yes because ultimately the falklands do n't matter in the slightest but it was a huge shit show in the uk that cemented thatcher in power for the next decade and the conservatives until 1997 which was exactly what reagan was after and jesus did the uk populace suck it up, 
  i think it 's very selective and applying a very recent standard to something that happened thousands of years ago , child marriages were normal here in the united states as recently as a hundred years ago there is substantive debate as to the actual ages involved but it 's possible the girl was n't actually nine , if she was even twelve she would be into the range generally considered marriageable well into modern times in north america and europe http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/sep/17/muhammad-aisha-truth at the same time the idea that someone would be actually prosecuted for suggesting mohammed was a pedo for possibly having sex with aisha is ridiculous , he should be able to make that argument free of the threat of state nasty stuff, 
  no i agree with that but it 's a refugee crisis , they are fleeing a war zone something has to be done and you have to deal with the ones you already got once they get there , they have rights under international law going forward i think trying to persuade turkey and other countries in the region to keep them and paying them off to keep them if necessary is probably the best way forward but have to manage the ones you already have as best as possible we are lucky here in the states we are an ocean away and can just observe the mess which i appreciate is a luxury you euros ca n't afford but frankly we should be doing more too , if i 'm to be honest it was our invasion of iraq that ultimately created this mess ultimately it is much cheaper to house and maintain these refugees in country 's like turkey which have a much lower cost of living , for every refugee accepted into finland the finnish government could probably support ten in turkey us government should also be doing more to fund this , so far it 's been a ridiculous pr job of how we are welcoming syrian refugees with open arms ( i think we took 1,000 carefully vetted ) when what we should be doing is giving money to fund a refugee support program in our close nato ally turkey and it 's a muslim country with an aspiring islamist dictator so they 'd feel more at home anyway so i 'm not saying , open the gates , let them come , and that they are all just going to integrate gloriously but you have to deal with what you got while being as non racist as possible , i mean we are maybe just now used to this having such an ethnically diverse population you may not want them here but once they 're there you have to treat them like any other citizen, 
  it 's a lot more difficult to own property and generally deal with it in jurisdictions where you do n't have a fundamental right to actually be there, 
  ok got it everyone either lives entirely in the uk all the time or entirely outside the uk all the time no british people own a second home in europe none at all the figure was 800,000 * households * ( so well over a million people ) in 2006 ten years ago but they 've obviously all sold them and retreated from the continent to good old soggy blighty http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/britons-with-second-home-abroad-up-45-in-two-years-425273.html, 
  three other guy clarified , it 's 1.2 m living permanently abroad , 2.2 includes people that live abroad for part of the year holiday home , summer in france that sort of stuff but they 'd presumably appreciate that too and want to keep it, 
  ok fair enough but 1.2 m is still a lot of people living permanently abroad and presumably the other million that lived temporarily abroad would also appreciate being able to do that and vote to stay, 
  yea so better get rid of them then or you have shitshows like this from time to time, 
  this is the thing your basically saying your a christian so that should be protected but you hate muslims who are violent savages and so that should n't be and you do n't like scientology because their strange american nuts and it 's all very new and high energy but hinduism is ok because they 're gentle savages you are selective in which religions exactly should be protected and the answer is basically `` christianity '' because you 're a christian with hinduism stuck in there in a pathetic attempt to try to seem neutral `` the ones i like '' yeah i 'm atheist , sue me i note you have no issue with me mocking scientology but saying christianity is just as ridiculous and you can smell my fedora ?
