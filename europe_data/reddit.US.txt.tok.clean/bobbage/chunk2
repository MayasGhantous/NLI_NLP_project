  if your faith and religion was strong enough you would n't need protection you either protect every belief possible ( and that 's impossible ) or protect none and have freedom of speech which is the far better idea i 'm actually not generally actively disrespectful of other people 's religions and do n't think that all religious people are stupid but i do n't think there should be a law against criticizing religions any more than there should be a law against criticizing vegans or carnivores or battery farmers or whatever else believe what you want but if you need the state to protect you from offence i wonder how strong your faith really is, 
  uk born is n't the same as british , boris johnson is n't a brit by that measure nor is anyone who naturalized like joseph conrad , george frideric handel , terry gilliam , salman rushdie , terry wogan or indeed prince phillip that old greek dog, 
  well the obvious answer here with the gummy bears is that you would throw away the bowl of gummy bears but people are n't gummy bears are you suggesting we just kill the entire population of helsinki because some of the people there might be poisonous gummy bears ? 
  if you need a nuke just let us know we could probably help out, 
  i did n't say like dogs , no if i 'm an american corporate worker and i 'm being deployed to japan , i 'm going to have cross-cultural training about the norms expected of a worker in japan which are very different than the usa https://www.shrm.org/publications/hrmagazine/editorialcontent/2015/010215/pages/010215-cross-cultural-training.aspx that 's what i 'm talking about ceos need this , successful ceos in multinationals or companies trying to compete in a foreign market get it https://www.communicaid.com/cross-cultural-training/blog/being-successful-in-international-markets-new-ceo-of-tesco-is-model-example/ because culture 's are genuinely different nothing about `` like a dog '' , you 're the one bringing that aspect into it fact is culture 's are very different and you ca n't just pretend they are all the same filtering the same core universal values , they do n't you need to train people on the differences and even with good training it can still be hard for them to adapt but if you do n't even bother telling them the basics you are only setting yourself up for disaster, 
  well that 's a problem for your police and justice system is n't it i 'm not suggesting let 's not hold them responsible i 'm saying prevention is better than cure and it can pay dividends to look into ways to reduce the likelihood of crime occurring in the first place through education and community outreach i do n't see the issue with this if you are taking these people in you need to train them on how your society works because where they come from it 's just fundamentally different, 
  i 'm just giving you a run down on the general us position which for a century now has been for decolonization and the dismemberment of the british empire you do n't seem to know what a colony is , it 's not an ethnic issue or how long the people living there have been there , it 's about being ruled by an external power without representation argentina is not a colony since it got independence from spain in 1816 , it rules itself , not an external power texas is not a colony because it is fully integrated into the united states and has full representation the likes of french guinea or reunion similarly are n't colonies despite being on different continents as they are similarly fully integrated into the french republic and enjoy full representation hawaii and alaska the same with regard to us the falklands do n't , however , they do n't have representation and they are governed by an external power , so by any definition they are a colony you can argue whether this is ok or not , and i acknowledge the islanders themselves have expressed a clear preference to remain british but then so did hong kong but you had no problem selling them out and refusing to grant those millions of former british subjects full citizenship and the right of abode in the uk so it 's sort of when and what suits you here if argentina invaded again ( which they would n't , they were slapped the last time and they 'd know they 'd get the same result this time ) the exact same thing would happen vis a vis the us , we would stay out of it and you could go get them back yourself if you were bothered , i 'm sure you spend enough of your gdp on defense to manage that by yourselves , right the united states never has and never will step in to defend european colonies in the western hemisphere against other american powers, 
  a lot of speculation , i would have thought actual physical contact like groping breasts and down the pants would be well over the line from sexual harassment to sexual assault , very surprised what would be considered sexual assault in any other western country is only the much lesser `` harassment '' in finland but whether that or catcalling and verbal harassment it is wrong certainly unfortunately it is common in the muslim world particularly with white females , their main exposure to white females is in porn and they get nutty ideas that every western girl is up for it on the bus and if you do n't grab you do n't get so they grab at home their sexuality is very repressed and male female interaction non-existent so come to the west where on the surface it seems different and women do n't cover their hair ( the dirty harlots ) and this stuff happens they should probably have a course on this sort of stuff when processing them , before releasing them into society , explaining social norms this is standard stuff if you 're western government or corporation worker going to a completely different culture , you need to get trained on what is allowed not allowed and also explain the consequences , that it 's serious , this sort of harassment might not be taken seriously in their home culture , even if they realise it 's wrong it might fall more into the `` i 'm being a bit of an asshole '' than `` this is seriously illegal do not do it '', 
  oh ok fair enough accept my apologies, 
  and what 's sexual harassment exactly in finland i gather finnish people do n't really like proximity or too much social interaction with strangers , at least while sober http://i.imgur.com/azzmgph.png so if a guy sits beside a girl on a bus and tries to strike up a conversation with some cheesy chat up line would that be harassment, 
  this was deliberately misleading of you i mean it even says #eastern finland 179 percent  in the title, 
  with a firm but fair hand, 
  it has been long standing us foreign policy since wilson that european powers have to fully decolonize the falklands on the un list for decolonization https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_list_of_non-self-governing_territories i agree the consent of the islanders is important but it was us policy during the war just the same that argentina was fundamentally the rightful sovereign power and something would have to be worked out the us at the time repeatedly called for a non military resolution to the crisis and made clear to britain that they were on their own and `` you 're on your own '' was about the best britain was going to get , the only reason reagan did n't intervene * on the side of argentina * was that he valued thatcher as a strong cold war ally contrast with suez where after britain actually won the military engagement eisenhower forced the uk to hand the canal over to egypt us policy on this is that european countries should not have colonies , period note most overseas french departments are not colonies as they have been integrated with france and have actual voting and representation in the metropole, 
  you can forge that like obama did right, 
  so did reagan who was president at the time  reagan , yielding to advisers who regarded britain 's insistence on retaining sovereignty over the sparsely populated islands as a colonial anachronism , urged the prime minister to show magnanimity rather than force the invading argentine troops to surrender , and to reach a cease-fire deal providing for a shared argentine-british role in the islands ' future and a joint american-brazilian peacekeeping force . 
  http://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/12/29/world/europe/falklands-war-caused-rare-friction-for-thatcher-and-reagan.html in fact the us almost intervened ... on the side of argentina  how the u.s. 
  almost betrayed britain  alexander haig wanted reagan to side with the argentines over the falklands , newly released papers show  according to newly released documents from the reagan library in simi valley , calif. , the u.s. almost took sides against its most important ally , driven by the diplomatic maneuvering of secretary of state alexander haig . 
   haig `` then described the elements of the american plan which in effect would give ultimate sovereignty to argentina but under evolutionary conditions which the islanders could ultimately accept . '', 
  http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052702303816504577313852502105454 you were lucky we remained `` neutral '' and that itself was only down to reagan and thatcher 's strong personal relationship and his desire to not weaken her seeing her as a vital ally in the fight against communism and that certainly worked , the war cemented thatcher 's premiership through to the end of the cold war and the conservative party ruled britain for almost two decades but every president been against british colonialism it has been long standing us foreign policy since at least wilson that while we value our relationship with the united kingdom the united states will not assist the uk in retaining it 's colonial possessions you saw this in 1956 with the suez crisis where even though you won militarily eisenhower told you to cut it out and surrender the canal to egypt which you did this was in line with long standing us policy of decolonization and it marked the moment britain was finished as a world power and the us ( and to a lesser extent the ussr ) cemented, 
  conservatives here complain about obama not respecting that either because he put his feet up on it serious https://www.allenbwest.com/michele/obama-tramples-the-constitution-and-the-furniture, 
   do you think crazies who walk around the market square carrying pics of aborted fetuses , spouting bullshit about massive genocide should be allowed to do so ? 
  as long as they are n't actively harassing individual people like women trying to enter an abortion clinic yes they should be allowed to protest which would n't be a problem in poland as you are run by the catholic church and do n't have abortion clinics  i can . 
  in a public space . 
  it 's a cult , not a religion . 
  well then this really gets to the core of the matter does n't it , who decides what is and is n't `` a religion '' why is the scientologists storey of aliens coming to earth billions of years ago in a dc8 and being blown up with nuclear bombs around volcanoes any more ridiculous or `` not a religion '' than the idea that there was this guy 2,000 years ago who walked on water changed water into wine raised people from the dead and then died himself and got up again after ? 
  sounds like a bullshit cult to me why does it get special treatment some religions more worthy of respect than others you seem to think, 
  should the blacks in america and south africa have just waited for the laws to be repealed no one would have been talking about repealing this had this brave comic not stood up and demanded that boy whore erdogan suck his dick he was inviting this prosecution you should all be standing with him in the netherlands demanding that boy whore erdogan submit to a veritable national bukkake from all capable male and trans female citizens of germany and the netherlands anything less only emboldens him, 
  i do n't think he 's actually done it yet as theres no news reports of him actually having gone through with it also he 's only doing it for tax reasons http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/boris-johnson-renounces-us-citizenship-tax-bill-mayor-london/385554/, 
  he 's actually legally 100 % american but he 's renouncing it after five decades to get out of paying taxes while spinning it as proving his britishness http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/boris-johnson-renounces-us-citizenship-tax-bill-mayor-london/385554/, 
  it 's complete and utter * racism * specifically as well obama is n't a citizen of a foreign country , he 's american boris johnson actually is a citizen of a foreign country which he is now saying ( after five decades ) he 'll renounce to `` prove he 's committed to britain '' but in fact it has a lot more to do with reducing his tax bill http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/boris-johnson-renounces-us-citizenship-tax-bill-mayor-london/385554/, 
  do you not think it should be repealed then hitler now erdogan why is erdogan `` friendly '' exactly anyway ? 
  because europe needs to appease and pander to him to try to get turkey to keep the refugee 's away why else is everyone falling over themselves to suck up to erdogan he 's a disastrous islamist with dictatorial tendencies and watch out even saying that because if your in turkey he 'll drag you into court over it http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/01/turkey-certain-words-and-images-become-sins.html thankfully the rest of europe is n't quite that bad ... 
  yet, 
  yeah malik really turned on him https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/07/24/why-obama-probably-won-spend-family-time-with-his-half-brother-kenya/xcltc1uprv0mjiyxe518kn/story.html the two sisters by contrast are very highly educated , both have phds, 
  there 's 27 other eu countries , altogether there are 2.2 million brits living in the eu outside the uk http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/eu-referendum-brexit-could-leave-british-expats-without-access-to-pensions-health-care-and-public-a6903211.html also the uk electorate is a lot smaller than that when you take out kids and people ineligible to vote like immigrants , it 's more like 46 million so sure yes there are more brits inside the uk than outside it but the brits living outside it are uniquely and viscerally impacted by this and should be expected to back the eu by a large margin it 's small relative to the overall uk electorate but in a close campaign it could be significant, 
  you were against the argies who were an utter mess both militarily and politically at the time , the invasion was a last ditch attempt to generate patriotic fervor and prop up an ailing military dictatorship they presumed you would n't do anything they presumed wrong in the end , the falklands war collapsed the dictatorship and gave argentina democracy and gave britain thatcher and the conservatives for the next decade and a half who really won, 
  before ww1 = pre 1914 interwar period = 1918-1939, 
  a duet school place person goes to learn to sing duets, 
   i did not say that either . 
  you can have laws you barely use . 
  you can but it 's not a good idea in a free country in our legal system if you do n't use a law it ceases to be enforceable https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/desuetude it 's like exercise for laws use it or lose it, 
  i ca n't speak bork this seems contradictory though surely every head of state is inherently a public figure so you ca n't punish someone if it 's a public figure like a head of state but the punishment it 's increased if it 's a public figure like a head of state and these laws are never used but we 're here having this discussion because this guy is being prosecuted and the other guy in germany, 
  this is bullshit so anyone can be thrown in jail for insulting anyone else in the netherlands , the jail term just goes up if it 's a foreign leader ? 
  what about the likes of bush or putin , did nobody ever say anything nasty about them in the netherlands or netanyahu or the king of saudi arabia ? 
  no one ever made a jibe about those guys ? 
  if i say / u/bosgeus is a boy whore who owes me a blowjob i can get three months in the clink if i ever travel to the netherlands ? 
  i presume your not a head of state / u/bosgeus apologies if you are otherwise , your a boy whore and you owe me a blowjob suck it , netherlands legal system,

   it 's not censorship , it 's protecting public space from unnecessary things that are controversial for the sake of being controversial . 
  i 'd disagree with this and particularly because it 's giving religion a special protected status in the state which should be neutral and secular what if fsm people started protesting pasta restaurants for cooking and serving their god for people to eat ? 
  should they be shut down ? 
  what about scientologists deciding that x or y criticizing their cult is blaspheming their religion ca n't make fun of xenu ?

   unregulated freedom of speech is not necessarily a good thing . 
  disagree , beyond speech that is imminently dangerous or inciting violence ca n't believe you are actually defending this, 
  they may eventually switch to usb-c , they used it on the new macbook for charging , but lightning can support usb3 .0 , the ipad pro is usb3 .0 but still uses a lightning port physically like usb-c it 's just a physical connector , there are usb2 usb-c phones as well, 
  maybe in denmark but they are actively used in other countries , a finnish mep was convicted in 2009 of blaspheming islam by calling mohammed a pedo in a blog post , for example also elsewhere  in greece , they had two of them in the past year . 
  spain also had one in 2012 , finland 's last prosecution was in 2008 , and germany 's in 2006 . 
   one was against a 27-year old scientist who created a facebook page making fun of a famous monk  the other was against the author and cast of a play , called corpus christi , which portrays jesus and his disciples as gays in modern-day texas  the scientist faces six months in jail , and the author , two years . 
  i think if you think these laws are old and you do n't want to prosecute them , better get rid of them - look at the whole situation with erdogan in the netherlands and germany where they 're saying well the law is old and antiquated and we do n't like this but it 's the law, 
   section 10 - breach of the sanctity of religion ( 563/1998 )  a person who  ( 1 ) publicly blasphemes against god or , for the purpose of offending , publicly defames or desecrates what is otherwise held to be sacred by a church or religious community , as referred to in the act on the freedom of religion ( 267/1922 ) , or  ( 2 ) by making noise , acting threateningly or otherwise , disturbs worship , ecclesiastical proceedings , other similar religious proceedings or a funeral , shall be sentenced for a breach of the sanctity of religion to a fine or to imprisonment for at most six months . 
  a lot of european country 's have these laws , i do n't think you can really blame it on russia specifically although it does probably date to that period it would have been the norm at the time across europe last successful prosecution was in 2009 for blasphemy against islam ( suggesting mohammed was a pedo in a blog post ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blasphemy_law#finland, 
  1gb of 256kbps data at $ 10 would be a good deal in germany ? 
  i 'm all for heavy environmental taxes just bear in mind as consumption taxes they are fundamentally regressive so it 's important at least to include some base level of consumption at no/low tax rate or alternatively have some mechanism to provide rebates to the poorer sectors of society, 
  google fi is ridiculously expensive compared with data plans in any european country , it 's nowhere near competitive $ 10 per gb it 's also ridiculously slow , it 's basically designed for emergency use only , not as an actual data service  in over 120 supported countries around the world , you can enjoy data for just $ 10 per gb ( the same rate as in the u.s. ) , cellular calls for $ 0.20 per minute , and texts at no additional cost . 
  you can also make calls over wi-fi . 
  the rates for calling over wi-fi depend on the country you 're calling and can be more or less than $ 0.20 per minute . 
   ** keep in mind that data speeds in the 120 + supported countries will be limited to 256kbps .

  ok , erdogan is some shit sandwich but  erdogan , long accused of cracking down on dissent domestically , was now abusing antiquated european laws in a bid to silence his international critics . 
  ultimately if european countries have an issue with this it is up to them to remove the laws which i believe both the netherlands and germany are now planning to do thanks to erdogan so thanks to erdogan 's thin skin we may actually see an improvement in freedom of speech in europe next up , blasphemy laws which are in place in : austria cyprus denmark finland france germany greece iceland ireland italy liechtenstein malta montenegro poland russia turkey http://end-blasphemy-laws.org/countries/europe/, 
  it 's not assad , the prime minister of syria is sunni https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wael_nader_al-halqi, 
  she 's from a right-wing anti-immigration party , it 's progressive pro-refugee people that are criticizing her, 
  the adapter counts as following the legislation , they are n't being forced to change the actual charging port on the phone, 
  as pointed out in the article netflix does n't even have a license to stream house of cards on netflix in many territories because they sold the rights to someone else so while it 's certainly not all netflix 's fault , it 's not entirely not netflix 's fault either , they are involved in it, 
  what i 'm saying is that the uk 's nuclear deterrent is entirely dependent on the us headline  #uk 's nuclear deterrent entirely dependent on the us seems pretty clear cut to me, 
  the guardian did n't seem to have an issue publishing it ,, 
  i support sanders what wad wrong ? 
  who supports cutting the ridiculous amount of money we spend in supporting you `` allies '' and fighting proxy wars for you ( like iran , iraq , afghanistan ) so we can have universal healthcare which you guys only manage because of our defense umbrella we have the nukes , and in the future if you want them your going to have to pay for them and on our terms no free loading like obamer said, 
  it 's not that high but it 's still worryingly high http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/gsi2-overview-7.png, 
  even just the us would do it 10 times over , adding the uk would raise that to maybe destroying russia 10.1 times all of the nuclear bombs actually in the uk are us bombs anyway under the nuclear sharing program , we have them stationed at usaf lakenheath near london http://www.lakenheath.af.mil/ https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrggv7ty6jljtccnvd-1kt7xey8eexcxhkahyamdewgx_kr7vcoxwnarz1d but only we can press the button the uk does n't have any of its own nuclear weapons actually in the uk any more , they keep them all underwater probably because of their storied naval history britannia rules the waves and all that russians know that and are tracking the submarines , they 'd take them out poof , only a couple of missile strikes and done it 's only because of us military might we let you have them and protect you ... 
  but fat thanks we get for it, 
  we have none, 
  there 's more of us https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/03/17/the-irish-american-population-is-seven-times-larger-than-ireland/, 
  bj you say, 
   but the headline implies that all planes are based in the uk/ireland , which is bs . 
  i honestly did n't think it implied that , only that there will be less of them based in the uk in the future , not that all of them are there now uk right now is their largest market , they are pivoting towards europe, 
  using deadly force in defense of property is legal in many states, 
  20 years for self defense ? 
  yeah if this happened in texas they 'd have been shot an armed society is a polite society, 
  it keeps the bad guys out of society and keeps the good guys safe as the saying goes a society with a massive prison capacity and a tendency to lock people up for long terms for the slightest of crimes is a polite and law abiding society, 
  we could also rename `` central '' to `` eastern '' then, 
  i think the point is this would n't have been considered dui in the first place in most other countries , she could have had four times the bac and still be legal in the us for example,
