  great grandfather , but my father is a ( dual ) citizen and registered me at birth ( as i will my children ) so i actually am an irish citizen as much as you or anyone else and have full rights to live and work anywhere in europe i 'm an american first obviously and sometimes poke fun at the euros , their hubris is just amazing , as is their flat out refusal to acknowledge that the us might just actually be a pretty damn good place overall i am well aware that making any positive statement about the us is highly triggering for / r/europe , so sometimes i may lay on the patriotism a bit thick but honestly this place could be renamed / r/antiamerica with the attitude of half the posters here but i acknowledge the practical value of an eu passport and do n't plan on giving that up any time soon , even if i never use it who knows trump might get elected and who knows what my kids might want for their future , that 's the great thing about this country , the sense of freedom and endless possibilities and an eu passport at the end of the day gives you more options so why not !, 
  i have visited the old country , we have relations there , nice place , strange in ways but a great sense of damp history , a people who even if permanently soggy on the outside have warmth in their hearts and bear living there with great humor, 
  i actually am , i even get your username reference it 's part of our strength that we all can be united as americans whether irish american african american asian american native american or whatever and still keep a connection to where we come from and our history and culture so yes i am irish and scottish but i am also part of something bigger and while i am proud of being irish and proud of being scottish and happy that i am not english i am most proud of being american, 
  yeah maybe if you had stepped up to the plate when we were invading iraq in the first place and not just left it to our good pals the uk you would n't have isis right now this is the whole problem , whenever something needs to be invaded we are left holding the can and doing the grunt of the work , it was the same in korea and vietnam lazy euros could n't get out there and left it to america to save the world from communism and now we are saving the world from radical islam or at least trying to but fat lot of thanks we get for that maybe we 'll just pull out and sit over here the other side of the ocean and leave you euro 's to sort out isis until you come back crying to mommy america to help you because the nasty muslim boy is beating you up for your lunch money good luck, 
  i mean we are the best because we have unity in diversity i know what it means english is an old euro language and we are speaking that now i do n't have a problem with european languages and culture it is most of our heritage after all i am irish and scottish myself and only 1/32 cherokee , i am more `` euro '' than `` american '' in that sense we remember and value our heritage while are incredibly accepting of new ones whether they be african american or asian, 
  like our missile defense that we are installing all over eastern europe to protect you from the commies  your entire university system is filled with chinese nationals lol that 's because we 're diverse and do n't have a problem with people who look different unlike you racist euros, 
  you euro 's are cute yeah erdogan really threatened us we were quaking in our boots over that one we were the us is in favor of a european army , if you actually integrated and started spending on your own defense we would n't have to be bailing you out all the time with our troops and missile defense systems which are n't free you know they are paid for by the hardworking us taxpayer it 's protecting your pussies in europe unable to defend yourselves that is the reason we do n't have healthcare as for education https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016/world-ranking https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/academic_ranking_of_world_universities https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qs_world_university_rankings eu is nowhere , it is all us us us us us us us with a sprinkling of uk and then one european university comes in somewhere around the 20th-50 mark good job euro 's, 
  at home ? 
  how is it used at home other than spending on the weapons systems that keep the whole world safe ? 
  sure it is used in pacific , if you did n't notice your old allies the japs decided to attack us from that direction , turned out worst for them did n't it kaboom atom bomb !, 
  kaboom there 's a second not just a one trick pony you germans are lucky you ran out of oomph a few months before or berlin would be radioactive right now you euros are so damn parochial and regionalist , you have no global vision , no concept of where the threats of the future are coming from ( hint : it 's islam and china ) and that 's all outside europe and you only have the united states trying to protect you from it the chinese have even bred a hybrid of chinese and muslim they call a hui , it has the irrational religion of the mohammedan and the indefatigable work ethic of a chinaman this is contained for now in china but who knows in the future ? 
  only the united states is keeping an eye on this stuff , if they were to release that towards europe what would you do ? 
  and no , you could n't defend yourself against russia , particularly not now the uk has left , russia has all the nukes what are you going to do , rely on the french ? 
  hon hon, 
  https://youtu.be/zphsxus0_1c?t=4m32s just look at the diversity in that audience e pluribus unum = we are the best, 
  we spend more on our military than the rest of nato put together only thing that 's keeping you safe in your beds, 
  nationalism is a problem in europe because you have small countries that are ethnically homogenous and so it often turns to racism like we saw with the nazis or britain during the brexit campaign there 's also a bit of short man syndrome which is what spurred on the likes of hitler and napoleon and the brits , if your country is very small and insignificant you will seek to expand outside it and cause trouble for your neighbours and the rest of the world nationalism is not such a problem if you are already the most diverse country in the world and do n't suffer from short man syndrome because you are genuinely the best , strongest and most powerful country in the world and are comfortable in your own shoes , like the us is in our case it 's a motivating force that keeps us the best and strongest and it does n't boil over into invading poland or trying to subjugate india america has long looked over at the old continent with bemused pity but for centuries tried to stay out of your petty squabbles , we only got involved in ww2 because you euros allied with japan and perhaps having better sense yourselves got her to poke the beast well that woke us up all right and we ended up having to come over there and sort your shit out and liberate y' all and set up the united nations and the european union to try to keep y' all from killing yourselves like you like to do every few decades tl ; dr it 's not unwarranted pride if you really are the best, 
   and why are people from a genocidal , murdering country constantly coming here to talk about europe ? 
  i remember the last time we had to come over there to save you from that , fat lot of thanks we get fact is you can only afford you 're socialist paradise because of the us military umbrella which you do n't pay for i will not stand for someone disrespecting us troops , they are the only reason you are n't speaking german or russian and you should give thanks for the sacrifice they made so you can get out of bed every morning in a free country, 
  it 's very beneficial for the us , we print money that foreigners then have to actually pay for , it 's free money for the us treasury we never have to pay back https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seigniorage#overseas_circulation  as american economist barry eichengreen summarized : ** `` it costs only a few cents for the bureau of engraving and printing to produce a $ 100 bill , but other countries had to pony up $ 100 of actual goods in order to obtain one '' ** . 
  in february 1965 president charles de gaulle announced his intention to exchange its u.s. dollar reserves for gold at the official exchange rate . 
  he sent the french navy across the atlantic to pick up the french reserve of gold and was followed by several countries . 
  as it resulted in considerably reducing u.s. gold stock and u.s. economic influence , it led u.s. president richard nixon to end unilaterally the convertibility of the dollar to gold on august 15 , 1971 ( the `` nixon shock '' ) . 
  this was meant to be a temporary measure but the dollar became permanently a floating fiat money and in october 1976 , the u.s. government officially changed the definition of the dollar ; references to gold were removed from statutes . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exorbitant_privilege#opposition_in_france yes it would n't exist if we were n't the best country and if india and china were n't dysfunctional but for now , we are the best and they are n't , i do n't see that changing in the immediate and the yuan is pegged to the dollar anyway in the future yes china is certainly long term potential competition tl ; dr suck it frenchies, 
  yes that 's up as well, 
  yeah because it 's the world 's reserve currency and the most reliable store of value over the long run the euro has dropped as well because brexit is bad for the eu as well as the uk , it 's just a hell of a lot * worse * for the uk, 
  a fighter jet would be quite ineffective , what he 'd want is a bomber, 
  no reason it ca n't be both [ why hitler wished he was muslim ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-ataturk-in-the-nazi-imagination-by-stefan-ihrig-and-islam-and-nazi-germanys-war-by-david-motadel-1421441724 ), 
  2 big sausage lots of smaller sausage, 
   few people realize that within the confines of the united states there is spoken today a far greater variety of languages ... than in the whole of europe . 
  we may go further . 
  we may say , quite literally and safely , that in the state of california alone there are greater and more numerous linguistic extremes than can be illustrated in all the length and breadth of europe . 
  - edward sapir ( the sapir-whorf guy , he 's actually one of the founders of linguistics as a discipline , not just some patriotic rando ) he 's just talking about native american languages there , not even including all the immigrants https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_united_states#native_american_languages many euro 's do n't realize just how diverse the us really is , it 's like a whole globe by itself really do n't get me started on how many different types of hot sauce we have , a convenience store in texas would have more diversity than the entire european continent i think ,, 
  immigrants it 's also 95 + so i think the actual figure is above 95 in the us it 's a bit below 95 as mexicans , mostly although also chinese grandmothers and the like only 80 % in the us speak english as a first language hardly surprising are we are very diverse , there are more languages spoken in california than the entirety of europe, 
   an european look and feel yes a euro look and feel , need to shoot in the uk or other anglophone location though for an english speaking look and feel , can you imagine game of thrones or the hobbit set in prague or budapest ? 
  prague is great for kafka novels and creepy eastern european stuff with mist and bridges and pointy castles and shit but it would n't work for english speaking stuff like game of thrones or the hobbit or lord of the rings , need to produce that sort of stuff in an english speaking country for authenticity, 
  i do n't deny the influence of the french at all , there were many french patriots that came to america and inspired by the great open vistas and pungent smell of freedom in the air helped us throw off the tyranny of the english king and then inspired by the success of our revolution exported it back to the old country and freed france itself from monarchical tyranny a few decades later i think it 's pretty universally accepted by historians that modern democracy was born in the united states and later exported to europe but sure it had its roots in europe that is where americans came from after all took a while to stick in europe , you had napoleon and then the kaiser and then hitler and stalin and musselini and franco and thatcher and so on but you got there in the end , sometimes with a little help from your friends the americans , 
  it 's actually a little known detail about american history but women had the right to vote immediately after the revolution , we were actually the first country in the world to allow it and women could vote in new jersey until 1807 and the right was restored in wyoming in 1869 , so there was actually only a very short period in american history when women did not have the vote , we were unique and very forward looking in that no other country gave women the vote at the time as it was n't realized that women were actually capable of rational thought , it was thought they were automatons that operated purely on emotions and hormones obviously slavery was terrible and wrong and a stain on our country 's history but our slaves were africans , while in greece they had fellow greeks as slaves , very different do muslim refugees get to vote in germany ? 
  is germany a proper democracy ? 
  i think the us will always have a soft spot in its heart for the uk , i mean genetically with my heritage i should really hate the english but something stops me and i have a grudging respect for what they did for us and the world , at the end of the day it 's where our county comes from and i do n't think we are ever going to forget that or abandon them the brits set out to build the greatest empire the world has ever known and although they ultimately failed at that task and their empire crumbled the offspring of that empire persisted , and being less racist than the mother country through open her arms and mated with the world and through strength and unity in diversity ultimately realized that objective and defeated communism the british could not civilize and live among their indians but we did it with our red man , more open minded we cracked the nut , settled , stayed and made a success of the place ... we may have different values to our parents , but i look over the sea to that small island and have to say , ultimately , we would n't be here without you , thanks mom , thanks dad , we wo n't forget you , we 'll always be here for you to support you as you decline in your feeble old age, 
  i mean true modern democracy , the pilgrims came from the uk and inspired by magenta carta established the first true democracy which persists to this day and in turn spread english around the world as the first global language obviously credit for this is mostly down to the americans and our thirst for freedom and plucky go getter spirit , but we were british at the time and i think deep down our principles come from that small muddy wet island , i do n't think we can just forget our roots and credit where credit is due the fount of american democracy has its ultimate source in that document signed in a muddy english field all those centuries ago you can trace that lineage directly to the present day and the greatest democracy the world has ever known wheras greece has been autocratic and even ruled by muslims in the meantime , the lineage was sadly broken also i do n't think you can really consider athenian democracy democracy when most of the population were slaves and women did n't have a vote, 
  movie business is dominated by america and there is no reason to suspect that will be impacted , if anything there could be an increase , the uk has always been hollywood 's go-to location for quaint oldy-tyme stuff and i do n't see any reason for that to change http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/game-of-thrones-is-safe-from-brexit-eu-referendum-vote-leave-funding-a7102826.html more difficult doing this stuff in the eu as they do n't always speak english, 
  cradle of western civilization and crucible of democracy and all that , i 'm irish myself ( and 25 % scottish ) and so have a healthy distrust for the english but i think you have to give them credit where credit is due , i mean what language are we all speaking here, 
  it 's not very consistent with what it counts , the uk has many far flung islands but it 's only counting the home country , new zealand it counts territories that are very far away but australia not , the us it is apparently counting our pacific territories on the far side of the date line ... 
  i 'm also not sure exactly what it is doing there as it has moved alaska and hawaii a lot closer to the mainland than they are in reality but then has something else far far off in the east ( presumably guam and samoa ), 
  colorado too https://www.google.com/search?q=colorado+map we like our grids over here edit : [ wyoming vs. colorado ] ( http://imgur.com/x5hs0vd ) , top post on / r/mapporn at the minute , not only are they rectangles , they are almost exactly the same size !, 
  europeans man they want to regulate everything, 
  yeah i 'd look at that sign and think `` happy fun times recreational area , come play ! '', 
  should really have it in english, 
  and microsoft supporting this ? 
  just like ibm enabling the nazis what is this shit, 
  yes a lot was taken in war or in a peace treaty but in most cases there was actually a payment involved , we paid $ 15 million for texas , california , nevada , utah , colorado , arizona and new mexico for example after we whipped their asses in the mexican-american war , not a bad deal if i do say so myself and no doubt mexico was negotiating from a position of duress but that 's what you get when you fight the united states , end of the day we did negotiate a price and pay for it . 
   with the defeat of its army and the fall of its capital , mexico entered into negotiations to end the war . 
  ** the treaty called for the us to pay $ 15 million to mexico ** and to pay off the claims of american citizens against mexico up to $ 3.25 million . 
  it gave the united states the rio grande as a boundary for texas , and gave the us ownership of california and a large area comprising roughly half of new mexico , most of arizona , nevada , utah , and parts of wyoming and colorado . 
  golan is a side issue it 's a small piece of land that virtually no-one actually lives in anyway good diversion though, 
  no , but they continue to control gaza militarily and completely control their foreign relations try sailing a boat to gaza and see what happens try flying a plane to gaza and see what happens fact is , most countries and the united nations consider israel to be still occupying it, 
  half of german is just misspelled english, 
  no , it 's also the west bank and most , including the united nations ( both the security council and the general assembly ) also still consider gaza occupied, 
  you might tell that to the united states , united nations , european union , every country on earth that is n't israel , the international court of justice , israel 's own supreme court ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israeli-occupied_territories, 
  even crocs http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/crocodile-bit-a-chunk-out-of-my-back-as-pals-dragged-me-free-26455168.html, 
  many countries prioritize their own human citizens over animals for some reason maybe because polar bears do n't vote and do n't pay taxes, 
  do you have polar bears up in the mountains in austria ? 
  i think there 's a little irish in everything, 
  israel will never give citizenship to palestinians in the territories it 's not going to happen clearing out the settlements ( or more realistic , leaving them but doing land swaps ) is more likely to happen than israel annexing and giving actual citizenship and voting rights to palestinians in the territories not going to happen, 
  so why did it let them settle there in the first place ? 
  why is it continuing to * expand * them ? 
  to create `` facts on the ground '' so they can then turn around and make exactly this argument it 's bullshit, 
  israel can and should remove them like it did with gaza, 
   the japanese were under american occupation in 1948 yet could n't vote against the president who dropped the bomb on them , could n't vote for senate or house yes and that was a temporary measure , the united states never had any intention of `` keeping '' japan permanently if palestinian sovereignty had been restored in 1973 , six years after the start of the occupation , like we returned japan 's sovereignty in 1951 , we would n't be having this argument other us territories were either given their independence ( cuba , the philippines ) or integrated fully into america ( alaska , hawaii ) keeping territories `` won in war '' indefinitely is contrary to the principles of self-determination , contrary to the decolonization process and explicitly contrary to the united nations which has censured israel repeatedly over this i do n't have an issue with israel occupying the west bank in 1967 i have an issue with them still being there fifty years later, 
  i do n't think that is what i said at all i think i said there should be two states and palestinians should have the basic right of being a citizen in a fully sovereign and independent palestine and any arabs within israel 's 1967 borders should get israeli citizenship , sure , but they have that already its not a major issue the question is the palestinians in the territories , and for that i think they need their own state and one that is actually independent and viable without israel interfering with it and subverting it continually and yes israel has an obligation to support that state and ensure that it works because they created this mess ... but an independent palestine `` working '' is in israel 's interest too , if only they would accept it what 's not going to work is just deciding to annex the palestinians and giving them all citizenship, 
  yeah we killed all the locals first , top tip , genocide the natives before you try this move, 
  he 's talking about the palestinians under israeli occupation , in the territories they do not have any vote or representation in the knesset despite the territories being ultimately under the control of israel for the last fifty years, 
  irish independence was achieved through war , you might have heard of it , it was called the irish war of , oh it escapes me , irish war of something or other , let me look it up on wikipedia , oh right here it is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_war_of_independence ireland was already independent for a decade by the time of the statute of westminster every real country has had to fight for its independence, 
  did you read the article ? 
  it 's saying the israeli occupation is the root cause of violence in israel/palestine if you were being occupied how would you feel , if the eu invaded you tomorrow and you had to drive on the right side of the road and all learn german and a pint was redefined as 500ml and tea banned to promote coffee , you would just sit there and take it ? 
   a two states secular country do you mean a single state ? 
  the problem with that is that it would be majority arab/muslim very very quickly due to the birth rate differences , there are concerns that even without actually annexing the palestinan territories israel itself will end up majority arab/muslim anyway http://www.ibtimes.com/israels-demographic-time-bomb-arab-majority-state-213933 then the problem is you either have a democracy in which israel is now a majority muslim state with a muslim leadership ( which no one in israel would be happy with ) or you have something else that is n't a democracy that preserves the nature of the place as a jewish state and gives special rights to the minority i think realistically there has to be two states i ca n't see it working otherwise, 
  i 'm sorry , this is some grade a bullshit the arab muslims have been there for literally thousands of years , who were the crusaders fighting exactly way back then ? 
  it was n't `` the indigenous jews '' because the place was arab muslim even then jerusalem features heavily in the koran ffs , mohammed flew there himself personally on a magic horse or some shit and this makes it important to them also , point is , it was in the original book , they did n't just cook this stuff up later the place is also obviously important to the jews and was their homeland in ancient times and they have persisted there since with a continual presence albeit as a minority during the islamic period and that has grown since the brits took the place over and then exploded after hitler did his thing and they reckoned better move fast while we have a bit of sympathy and these brits are confused and do n't know what they are doing and there you have it , israel and the reality is israel is a fact and must be accepted and is only rejected by hardline islamic nutjobs and western anti-semites , israel is there now , it has been there for longer than most people now alive have been on this earth with millions of israeli citizens born there who know no other home and it 's not going anywhere , that must be respected at the end of the day there are two populations there both who have an extensive history and a legitimate claim to the general area and any solution is going to have to regcognize both ... but imo that has to be israel returning to the 1967 borders and giving the palestinians a realistic territory they can actually get on with , not a slice of swiss cheese, 
  it would n't , no , i mean we flat out [ bought most of our current country ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/territorial-acquisition-uscensus-bureau.jpg ) and no-one is calling for texas or california to be returned to mexico or louisiana to france or alaska to russia or florida to spain , we bought that land fair and square , i mean there comes a point at which you just have to accept it right, 
  you do n't think it 's a problem that a party with a third of the vote gets all of the power ? 
  the uk is also an effective two party system , the leader of the county has been either labour or conservative for the last century . 
  and before that it was liberal and conservative , or whig and conservative or whatever they do n't have an effective multi party system if it was any other european country they 'd have proportional representation in parliament and a third of the vote would mean a third of the seats and they 'd have to compromise and do a deal with another party for government , so you 'd end up with a coalition that had collectively over 50 % support that 's the ideal , that 's democracy our system is also fucked up , fptp is fucked and i do n't agree with a two party system , but at least one of the candidates does have to get the support of at least half of the electorate the norm in the uk is the government never actually has majority support , it 's the norm in the uk that they are governed by people two thirds of the electorate * voted against * that 's even more fucked up than our system , fucked up as our system is, 
  what percentage of the vote did the ruling party get in the last election ? 
  30 , was it ? 
  in the us , the guy that wins always gets over 50 % of the electoral college and almost always that means over 50 % in the popular vote too when was the last time a ruling party in the uk had over 50 % of the popular vote ? 
  erdogan ca n't do anything with the nukes , the us retains the launch codes we may look stupid sometimes but we 're not that stupid, 
  says the man whose country just voted to shoot itself in the head and has a prime minister that was not elected by the people and a queen that was not elected by the people and boris johnson as foreign secretary, 
   the military exists to serve the people and their elected leader , they do n't in turkey , though , they exist to protect the constitution and the secular nature of the turkish state against islamism, 
  `` democratically '' `` elected '', 
  sort of understandable why he did that , though , given what has just happened, 
  looking back i got a bit heated there sorry i have nothing against individual english people , they are fine , i am sure you are fine , you had nothing personally to do with all the oppression and i am sure you are a very nice person , it 's just the history , it can get me a bit worked up as an irish-scottish-american i have after all been oppressed thrice by the english which is a lot of oppression nothing personal , no hard feelings, 
   england has done nothing to you it enslaved my people for 800 years , look up cromwell who caused the great potatoe famine which is considered by most historians to be a genocide https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1os231/why_did_the_british_treat_the_irish_so_badly/ scotland too , even the archbishop of canturbury admitted it http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/10411067/english-have-bashed-scots-for-800-years-says-archbishop.html and we all know how you taxed the colonies while denying them representation we were glad to be rid of you everyone is always glad to be rid of the english and just look at us now , all grown up and with all the money america ... ireland ... india ... signapore ... hong kong ... these brave nations have fought off english tyranny and raised themselves free at last , my only hope is that scotland will shake off the yoke next inshallah eu ca n't wait for you to go if you can get irish citizenship i 'd recommend it , i could n't imagine waking up every morning being english, 
   you are not scottish or irish my eu passport would disagree thankfully got it from the country ( real country , that can issue passports , that being one of the hallmarks of an actual real country ) that had the sense to stay in and actually appreciates its diaspora and legally considers them irish same as people who live in the country dual citizenship , can roam freely and work and live anywhere in the 50 states of the us ** and ** the ~ ~ 28 ~ ~ 27 states of the eu unlike you little englander england is a country !, 
  it is !, 
  it is !, 
  types who are going to be stuck on the little landmass i posted above, 
  naturally i 'm 100 % american , born and bread , but i 'm also 25 % scottish and 12.5 % irish as that 's where my ancestors came from and we honor and respect that in america , it 's one of the things that makes us the best country in the world , we are united in diversity and 100 % american but do n't forget where we came from or deny our heritage,
