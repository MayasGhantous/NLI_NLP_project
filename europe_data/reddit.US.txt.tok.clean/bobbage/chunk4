  i think all of us are a little bit irish but i can actually trace my ancestry , it 's all documented, 
  i understand perfectly that england was an actual real historical country in the past ( up to union with scotland in 1707 ) and that notion of it being a `` country '' has continued in a ceremonial use , yes england is a `` country '' the same way that the basque country is a country , or the west country is is a country or greenland is a country or the pays de la loire is a country or the german * lander * are countries , it 's just a historical anachronism and ** it 's not special ** , plenty of other places have country in the name as well , that does n't make it ** a country ** in the primary usage and definition of the term which is `` sovereign state '' ireland is a country , india is a country , the united states is a country , because we all got rid of you lot , scotland will be a country soon god willing but england is not a proper country and even if scotland does break off you 'll probably be stuck with northern ireland keeping you not a proper country in perpetuity how you like them apples, 
  i 'm a troll because i point out facts ? 
   england is not controlled by its own government , it is controlled by the government of the united kingdom that 's a fact if you are trying to claim that england is a country because england elects mps that then serve in the parliament of the ** united kingdom ** then any subdivision of anywhere that elects representatives to a national government can be a country new york elects representatives and senators to the national government of the united states in washington , therefore new york is a country by your definition furthermore new york actually has ** its own ** legislature which england does n't fact i do n't see how pointing out that new york has more constitutional de jure and de facto legislative independence than england does makes me a `` troll '' , that 's a simple fact you brought up the definition where a country can be `` rural districts , including farmland , parkland , and other sparsely populated areas , as opposed to cities or towns '' i agreed sure england can be a country in that sense , it 's a country the same way a farmer 's field is , why not but not in the primary definition which is what we are talking about you seem not to understand these issues so when i bring them up and explain them to you you just fall over on calling me a troll whose trolling who here ? 
  england is not controlled by its own government , it is controlled by the government of the united kingdom , which is not the same thing despite what many english seem to think yes i 'm aware the word country has more than one definition , sure england is a `` country '' the same way a rural district or farm is `` country '' , but it is not `` a country '' in the primary meaning of that term which is synonymous with a sovereign state i have no issue with your saying england is a `` country '' if you just mean it is a country the same way as a field is `` the country '' , sure , but it is not `` a country '' in the same sense that the united states or ireland or france is a `` country '' , proper countries new york state actually has a legislature and fundamental guaranteed constitutional powers which is more than england has , england has nothing nada, 
   : an area of land that is controlled by its own government http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/country by that definition new york state is more a country than england is, 
  england is less of a country than new york is , i know english people like to think they 're special but they aint, 
  it 's clearly biased , i 'd take the original english source as correct, 
  some of us are actually proud of that , we are the most diverse and racially tolerant country on the planet , * e pluribus unum * , but we still remember where we came from , nothing wrong with respecting your ancestors, 
  i 'm not finding it http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/service/location.html http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49alpha.htm, 
  i mean the country with the most english speakers the best one that aint england england is n't even a country , although i grant you it may be one again soon if scotland has any sense ( i 'm 25 % scottish and 12.5 % irish , so you can imagine my views on the english ) nothing personal bud, 
  who said i 'm joking about anything ? 
  my whole point on this has been that english is the dominant world language ... which it is and that 's because of us , the united states of america like i said , what language are you speaking to me in ? 
  french ? 
  romanian ? 
  because who kicked the nazis ass back in ' 45 ? 
  no joke , them 's the facts, 
  so find me a better source that shows french has more speakers than english then you wo n't be able to fact is , english is # 1 , i mean what are you speaking to me in right now eh ? 
  we are just quibbling here over minor details of exactly * how much * better it is than french , so is it ten times better or only five times better , is that really material ? 
  point is , it 's better , and there are more ** first language ** english speakers ** in one country ** ( usa !, 
  usa ! ), 
  than there are l1 and l2 english speakers in ** the entire world ** becasue all the cool kids want to learn english fact what are you speaking right now ? 
  #english as god intended when he put us in charge of this place, 
  french is the same , the 220 million is mostly second language speakers je suis parle francais myself et jai dans la 220m pourqui je suis oblig\u00e9 eleve \u00e7a dans l'ecole quand je suis un jeune ` un, 
  dude , there are more than that number of english speakers in one country alone ( i think you know the one i mean , the best country ) place | language | speakers - | - | - ** 1 ** | ** english ** | ** 2,000 million ( number one , numero uno , best language spoken by best country ) ** 2 | mandarin chinese | 1,090 million ( only spoken by chinese people , no one else likes it ) 3 | hindustani | 711 million 4 | arabic | 585 million 5 | spanish | 560 million 6 | russian | 260 million 7 | bengali | 259 million 8 | portuguese | 250 million 9 | malay | 250 million 10 | french | 220 million https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers so number 10 i guess you can take solace that you are at least ahead of german because you managed to whip more natives in africa in the nineteeth century ... although to be honest that was n't even france , the largest french-speaking country in the world ( the drc ) speaks it thanks to belgium , not france whipped by poor little catholic belgium ... would n't be the first time your indochinese colonies had sense and dumped the language for english as soon as they could , that 's what all the cool kids speak now in vietnam, 
  i think realistically you will stick with english , it 's [ the overwhelmingly the most common language in the europe as it is ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/map-of-the-most-spoken-foreign-languages-of-the-eu-by-country/ ) even with the brits gone and also overwhelmingly leads in the world as a whole , about twice as many english speakers as the next most common language , four times as many as speak spanish , ten times french or german ... 
  i mean here we are , conversing in it , it 's the de facto world lingua franca wonder why that is ... 
  thank you for the information , i knew australia was founded by convicts but did n't know modern france was the same, 
  well thank you for a very informative post , i learned something today , i knew about the revolution as i said but never heard of this second thing i guess it is similar to how christmas is really a pagan winter festival and the us political system is basically a rehash of ancient rome , everything old is new again, 
  that 's nice an all but can they do [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gi2vbsx.jpg?1 ) , takes real skill , not just turning on the colored exhausts for show i looked up 14 juillet , it means 07/14 , that 's tomorrow , for any non-french speakers out there so what happened on 07/14 in france for the few non-frenchies on this overwhelmingly english-speaking american site ? 
  was this your independence day when you kicked out the brits , i remember from high school history something about you copying our revolution and the us and france being very close back then , we have a load of places named after lafayette who fought for us before returning to france to throw out the english and start his iconic department store , i think his years in the united states must have given him incredible business * nous * that catapulted him ahead of the peasantry and petite bourgeoisie in the old country, 
  this is technically true that the law was signed by obama , although it was a republican law from the republican congress obama signed only reluctantly and subsequently made executive exemptions to in his executive capacity over republican protests one of those exemptions was for diplomatic , government and humanitarian visits https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/visa-waiver-program/visa-waiver-program-improvement-and-terrorist-travel-prevention-act-faq so yes is technically true this law dates to obama 's tenure but you 'd have to wonder if the vigor of detaining a former head of government of a western european ally traveling on a diplomatic passport would have occurred in the absence of the current executive 's orders on the borders, 
  yes and it would be worth less in real terms we can invest in british companies you know , it 's an international market brits can equally invest in us ones many do many with sense and if you did , you 'd be better off , because the uk market is down in real terms, 
  i had $ 100 at the start of this year ( in fact i had much more but i digress ) if i invested that $ 100 in the ftse at the start of the year i would have less than $ 100 now, 
  that 's anti-semitic, 
  i do n't disagree that there can be benefits in currency devaluation not a bit , sometimes it is necessary and it makes your exports cheaper and more competitive can be a great stimulus china has been artificially keeping their currency low for years for this reason but there is no world in which your nok devalues by 20 % and your assets go up by less than that you now have more money you have less my point is simply that if something is denominated in a particular currency and it rises by 14 % in that currency while simultaneously that currency devalues by 18 % it is not worth more in real terms , it is worth less i agree germany in the 20s ( which was hyperbolic to start , an extreme example ) was a bad example as it seems to have only completely distracted people from my point, 
  my point is simply that the ftse100 is down in real terms i see bringing up deutschmarks in the 1920s has been a massive distraction , so ignore that bit if it helps the ftse100 is still down in real terms, 
  i 'm not confusing anything , i 'm giving another example of when a currency collapsed the point is if you only think in deutschmarks - well you were doing fantastically in the 1920s , were n't you , you had trillions of the things up up up it was great this is the point , you ca n't just think in terms of deutschmarks , or zimbabwe dollars , or gbp , you need to look at it in real terms would you prefer to have $ 100 us or $ 1,000,000 zimbabwe and in real terms the ftse100 is not up , it is down fact is , if you had # 100 at the start of the year , and instead of investing in the ftse you converted it into dollars , and then did n't bother investing it in anything and hell bought yourself a hot dog because you deserve a hot dog , * you would have more money now * than had you invested in the uk stock market and you would have enjoyed a hot dog it 's the same every time one of these `` uk stock market up '' stories is posted , the numbers are always in the article showing it 's actually down in real terms but brexiters are too damn dumb to realize, 
  the article says exactly that  this year has seen the index achieve its best annual performance since 2013 , ** ending the year 14 % up . 
  **  the ftse 100 is dominated by multi-national companies that have benefited from the uk 's decision to leave the eu . 
   these companies tend to have earnings in foreign currencies , like the us dollar , which have been buoyed by the decline in the value of sterling . 
   the pound fell again on friday , ** ending the year 18 % lower against the us dollar ** than it was at the time of the referendum . 
  translation , in real terms , the market is actually ** 4 % down ** , it only looks `` up '' because the pound has fallen off a cliff and the ftse100 is denominated in gbp german companies were doing absolutely fantastic by this measure during the 1920s during hyper inflation , if you needed a wheelbarrow full of deutschmarks to buy a load of bread think of how many trillions volkswagen must have been worth very misleading headline, 
  arabs are also white semitic people same as jews and you do n't get whiter than woody allen, 
  yeah no way you 'd argue personal use, 
  i mean austria is more religious and more conservative and has a larger problem with right-wing extremism , compared to germany . 
  they very nearly elected an extreme right-wing race-baiting anti-immigration islamophobe president , it was very close and they had to have a revote . 
  similarly the us is more religious and more conservative and has a larger problem with right-wing extremism compared with canada ... and we did elect an extreme right-wing race-baiting anti-immigration islamophobe president ... while canada has [ this guy . 
  ] ( http://wpmedia.calgaryherald.com/2016/08/prime-minister-trudeau-meets-canadian-hope-and-canadian-joy.jpeg ), 
  and more catholic and right wing extremist, 
  or like there are more irish in america than in ireland ... although i do actually have a passport personally , they hand them out like candy, 
  and english, 
  it 's possible to be both american and irish you know , they even have a word for it , * irish-american * were irish people not irish when they were english ? 
  the point is you do not have to live or be born in ireland to be irish it 's in the blood in fact there are more irish outside ireland than in it , and having visited i can sort of understand that my family is very into genealogy we have traced back our history meticulously and i am 100 % irish on my father 's side as was his father before him 50 % this makes me as irish as you are , as irish as the irish football team most of whom were born outside ireland you are probably too young to remember usa 94 , what a nail biter that was it was looking like usa were going to play ireland in the quarter finals but then we were both knocked out probably as well i do n't know who i would have cheered for probably the winner anyway fair dues to brazil they went all the way i was always very into soccer even then as the national sport of the old country , this was before it became a `` thing '' this is the problem with you young people you have no connection to your heritage , your history , your ancestors that made you who you are, 
  so if you left ireland and went to live abroad you would cease to be an irish person ? 
  is that how it works ? 
  what about black ppl who immigrate or chinese can they not be irish ? 
  is jack charlton not irish ? 
  mick mccarthy ? 
  this is a racist anti-american conception of irishness that has no place in modern europe, 
  so devalera , another proud irish-american that actually led you to your independence , was n't irish ? 
  shaw , wilde , beckett , joyce , not irish writers as they lived most of their lives outside ireland ? 
  which i can understand , the weather is depressing, 
  the fact is , english is now an american language , more people speak it here than in ireland or england and it 's because of our sheer wondrousness and economic and military might admired around the world that it has become the de facto global language so i would defer to daniel webster on this or any other matter , not whatever corruptions may have become the local vernacular on the alleyways and country lanes of the old country and i say that as an irishman , an irishman always and by blood ( 50 % ) but also a proud and patriotic american, 
  i 'm an actual irishman as much as you are unless you are racist against americans it is often said that boston is a more irish city than dublin, 
  england is not a member state of the european union england is a subnational division of a member state of the european union hence yes it is in the european union but it is not * a member * of the european union same like catalonia is * in * but not * a member * of the eu or bavaria , or sicily , or any other subnational division, 
  in the united states we have a phrase `` uncle tom '' no true irishman would say that and i say that as an irishman myself certainly no true scotsman would say it england is the enemy , not scotland ( i am also part scot , mostly of celtic blood ), 
  it 's a devious policy by the malignant english to deny the very existence of the celtic nations and must be resisted at every turn, 
  they are not members any more than your house is a member denmark is a member your house may be in denmark but it is not a member, 
  i do n't see either happening but i was responding directly to someone saying that spain would give away andalucia given half the chance and it only cared about catalonia cuz it 's rich he was specifically talking about that from spain perspective that was what i was addressing, 
  so , spain is not likely to give away andalucia which was my point seems you agree with the one talking shit hombre, 
  this is the uncomfortable reality of modem europe, 
  you think spain would give away andalucia just cuz it 's poor right now ? 
  the reconquista meant nothing ? 
  you have no sense of history or nationhood , it 's all just about the $ $ $ ? 
  cordoba , sevilla , granada are not spanish cities ? 
  you would sell them to the chinese ? 
  so your wife tells me, 
  a part yes not a member my ancestral home is a part of the eu castle bobbage is not however a member of the eu look up liberty dollars, 
  it 's still the official currency of the eu used for all internal accounting purposes and statistics and that all member states are bound to join unless they got a specific opt out and `` england '' is not a member of the eu, 
  what 's the vatican if not a big house there are people here with properties bigger than that place and it 's a state, 
  took the united states to defeat them militarily and give cuba their independence , and look at that place i think spain will hang on to whatever it can get , it still occupies parts of morocco and portugal ffs it 's not giving up anadalucia andalucia is where columbus set sail from in 1492 which pretty much makes it the most important part of europe, 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's the official currency of the * european union * which is what this chart is about and where it comes from via the german federal statistics office seriously what do you think it is all eu stats are quoted in euro 's the eu is quite keen on it for some reason it 's going to be euro 's or the only other alternative is it 's going to be dollars and i do n't think it 's dollars no one cares about your funny norwegian money although you do have a lot of same, 
  plus it 's sort of the order of the world is it not next up , scots do n't like the english, 
  it says party list, 
  i 'm going to guess euro 's given that it 's europe, 
  it 's not just the measurement of course there 's a visible border between poland and germany germany is a much richer country poland had made massive strides and is a lot richer than it was but germans still have more $ $ $ same applies with france and spain lesser scale, 
  ireland has a much higher gdp/capita than the uk , actually much higher than any eu state but luxembourg but it 's all american money https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita, 
  more picturesque than detroit, 
  yes i think i said that , and i do n't think it 's a good example , but that also means that we were the most recent major country * to get rid of * slavery , and that is for sure sets a good example to the world and we can hold our heads high, 
  i 'm aware , it 's why we had them when we modelled our country on the roman republic does n't make it right, 
  thank you looks like the sort of place that has epic sagas with sea monsters jesus christ quick google and they are n't even legends http://strangesounds.org/2015/08/terrifying-deep-sea-creature-captured-off-faroe-islands.html, 
  cyprus is n't part of greece i 'm talking about the islands that are part of greece you know the country greece in south-eastern europe / western asia, 
  that 's not how it works french guinea and curaco and aruba and bermuda are n't in europe because european country by that logic the united states was in europe until 1776 and then switched continents that 's not how any of this works, 
  that 's leaving out a million iraqis ... 
  what language is that, 
  and why is that given that asians are very peaceable people at home in asia and in the united states as well , asians have lower crime rates here than white people must be something to do with the uk if you take a broad view globally over the last two centuries white people have been responsible for more crime worldwide than any other ethnic group look at the likes of churchill or hitler vs gandhi, 
  most crimes in the uk are committed by white ppl, 
  the islands , you ca n't say anatolia is asia but an island like half a mile off the coast is europe it 's nonsense it would be like saying the caribbean was in europe because it 's not touching america no touching !, 
  it 's europe is antarctica in europe now just because it is n't touching ?
