  that 's not how it works that 's not how any of this works,

   a large part of russia is european according to this map . 
  russia is a transcontinental country . 
  depends on how you define it , by the continent model taught in russia ( 6 continents , which makes more sense ) all of russia has been on one continent since they sold us alaska, 
  the greeks had slavery , i 'm not sure they are a great authority also much of greece was in asia ( and arguably still is ), 
  by that argument most of iceland is in north america http://geosite.jankrogh.com/images/is/iceland_mid-atlantic_ridge_fig16.gif,

  aka white ppl have you heard of chris columbus and george washington ? 
  singapore may not be china but i did n't say it was china i said it was populated by chinese which it is ( mostly ) same as the us is populated with europeans ( mostly ) but is not in europe, 
  / u/ravek below gave a source from the netherlands police that says they are trained specifically to do exactly that , aim for the legs * if possible * i believe the germans are trained this way as well certainly they do it often enough, 
  it 's because your chinese and have a natural tendency to order , rule following and subservience to authority china itself has a very low murder rate for a developing country , just compare it to other brics like brazil or russia both of which are richer but far more violent i looked it up brazil is 36 times more violent than china china by contrast is about as violent as switzerland not very hong kong and macau also have a comparable murder rate to singapore and they achieved that without banning chewing gum,

  especially if the victim is black , which they usually are kill one white australian woman and it 's an international incident,

  nothing wrong with gay porno, 
  what do you think the ** united ** states is exactly ? 
  we already did this , just around 200 years ahead of you guys ... we joined together 50 different states , as diverse as any that have ever been seen in this earth , into a greater hole . 
  and yes as you say being in a union of 50 diverse states spanning a continent with 320 million people has indeed been good to us , it made us the richest most powerful country the world has ever seen . 
  like the british empire but richer and better and more powerful and with freedom and equality under god for all of our citizens . 
  with a single market , freedom of movement , currency union , and all the trimmings . 
  i doubt we 'd be in the same position if every state did its own thing and you had to pay a tariff to export to california and deal with 50 different sets of regulations . 
  good luck , you 're going to need it . 
  you 're not going to have ireland and india and africa to strip bare and exploit for their resources this time around . 
  you 'll have scotland , that 'll be about it , and if god wills it you wo n't have that for long either . 
   much more than we got out only if you value access to the single market as being worth nothing this is the problem with you guys , you have this brain dead simple minded view of the figures where the only thing that you can quantify is money directly handed over , you ca n't quantify economic benefits in the abstract at all every study that has been done values the benefit of single market access to the uk at far , far above its direct eu contributions or eu receipts like an order of magnitude difference economics is not a zero sum game it 's not a you won so we must have lost situation , both sides can win and both the eu and uk did win from single market access running a country is not like running a corner shop selling teabags this is exactly the same sort of moronity that got trump elected, 
  it 's just not that much money , on a national economy scale brexiter brits are so damn parochial , you see $ 100bn and think golly i could buy a lot of teabags and crumpets for that you ca n't see the big picture and access to the single market and having goodwill with your largest trading partners is for sure worth $ 100bn $ 100bn is literally 1.69 x bill gateses one person it 's not even an amount equal to the two richest * individuals * in america and you 're a nation of what 64 million people and it was the highest top end estimate anyway you 'll probably get a discount as the eu will feel sorry for you , plenty much lower figures were mooted but even if it takes $ 100bn to stay in the eu 's good books after all this it would be better for your economy $ 100bn is a bargain you 'll be begging for the $ 100bn in 18 months time top tip - offer the $ 100bn in pounds sterling because that 'll be worth about what zimbabwe dollars are at the end of this christ you people, 
   also , there is a difference between nationality and citizenship . 
  you could be a british citizen but not a british national , which might be the case there . 
  other way around all citizens are nationals not all nationals are citizens for example here , american samoans have this status they are us nationals but not us citizens all us citizens are us nationals though i presume it works the same in the uk we give american samoans full rights to live in the us though which you guys notably did not do for hong kongers, 
  the uk has an `` exceptional reservation '' on uk as well https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-1_alpha-2#exceptional_reservations you might have noticed it in the domain name for uk web things, 
  providing cell service costs money the more people you have to provide it to the more it costs but in most industries the more people you sell to the more money you bring in and you also enjoy * economies of scale * this obviously ca n't be true in the cell network industry though as it appears the less customers you have the more money you make , because of all the savings of not having to pay for a bigger network infrastructure so logically i can only surmise that each country only has the same fixed pot of money to spend , regardless of how many people they have to make the cell network cover as if this were not the case you would expect with economies of scale the largest countries would have the best cheapest cell networks as this is not the case clearly it must be that someone ( probably iceland ) set a cap on the amount of money available and this makes us cell service crap as we have to cover the ( much larger ) country and ( many more ) subscribers but clearly do n't get any more money for it idk could also be because of our incredible diversity , our diversity is not limited to the color of our skin but even extends to our cell networks where we use two completely incompatible technologies , rather than just using gsm like europe does no diversity there , it 's all gsm gsm , gsm , gsm we have incredible diversity , gsm , cdma and the frequency bands !, 
  what diversity , it 's so diverse your phone from anywhere else has almost no chance of working the us is so diverse your cell phone probably wo n't work if you go the next state over and you are n't on verizon, 
  you just press the big red button you know nothing about how this works, 
  the uk public seems remarkably bad at dealing with large , national-economy-scale numbers , or quantifying any economic benefit that is n't a neatly written down on a check and handed directly over to them , 100 billion is simply an unfathomable amount of money and nothing possibly in the world could be worth spending it that figure is 1.69 bill gateses to put it in context , at current exchange rates will probably be under 1 bill gates by the time the negotiations are over though, 
  it 's more expensive to dub the internet into german smaller nations use subtitles, 
  yes what people do n't realize is that only the first 100,000 subscribers in any country actually have to pay for mobile service therefore as you can only get subscription revenue from a maximum of 100,000 subscribers it is easier to cover a small country of a few million with that limited revenue than a large country with 50m + that 's why our cell service is so shitty and expensive in the us , have to provide service to 320m people but can only charge the first 100k , same revenue base as iceland, 
  no trump is worse, 
  do note the source - good article on the `` cartoonist '' : http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/brilliantly-terrible-the-political-cartoons-of-the-onions-stan-kelly `` labelling everything '' is one of the tropes he lampoons, 
  it 's worth bearing in mind it 's an american cartoon in an american paper ( * the buffalo news * ) for an american audience , who have probably heard of theresa may particularly if they are interested in politics but would n't necessarily know exactly what she looks like, 
  this one is great / r/politicalcartoons/comments / 6gqr5x/strong _ and_stable_oc /, 
  no it was n't it had a king who was a tyrant, 
  that is revisionist bs from racist southerners , unfortunately racist southerners can edit wikipedia just like you or i yes the war for the north was to preserve the union but it was also explicitly , from the start , to prevent the spread of slavery to the new territories the south seceded in the first place 100 % , entirely , over slavery  drew gilpin faust , harvard university : well , historians are pretty united on the cause of the civil war being slavery . 
   and the kind of research that historians have undertaken , especially in the years since the centennial , when there has been so much interest in this question of the role of race and slavery in the united states , that research has shown pretty decisively that , when the various states announced their plans for secession , they uniformly said that ** the main motivating factor was to defend slavery . 
  ** [ civil war 's causes : historians largely united on slavery , but public divided ] ( http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/military-jan-june11-civilwar_04-12/ )  myth # 1 : the civil war was n't about slavery . 
   the most widespread myth is also the most basic . 
  across america , 60 percent to 75 percent of high-school history teachers believe and teach that the south seceded for state 's rights , said jim loewen , author of `` lies my teacher told me : everything your american history textbook got wrong '' ( touchstone , 1996 ) and co-editor of `` the confederate and neo-confederate reader : the ` great truth ' about the ` lost cause ' '' ( university press of mississippi , 2010 ) . 
   `` it 's complete b.s. , '' loewen told livescience . 
  `` and by b.s. , i mean ` bad scholarship . ' '', 
   in fact , loewen said , the original documents of the confederacy show quite clearly that the war was based on one thing : slavery . 
  https://www.livescience.com/13673-civil-war-anniversary-myths.html  yes . 
  without a doubt slavery was the predominant reason . 
  there were other grievances , but they were minor . 
  https://www.quora.com/did-the-confederacy-fight-the-civil-war-primarily-to-preserve-slavery-or-were-other-reasons-dominant http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/25/gavin-mcinnes/tweet-civil-war-was-about-secession-not-slavery/, 
  i did n't start this , i did n't bring up women and voting and slavery and all the rest , it was the other guy saying the united states was founded as a terrible genocidal despotic undemocratic regime and i was merely defending the country against that so yes we had slavery and yes women did n't have the vote and sure this was wrong but it was hundreds of years ago and europe was not any better , that is all my point is 1991 was when the last canton gave women the vote , they were allowed vote in other cantons and federally before that but only in 1991 were women allowed vote throughout switzerland on an equal footing to men, 
  the civil war was 100 % about ending slavery , it was only about `` states rights '' in the sense of `` states rights '' to have slavery , this is apologia used by southern racists ( who are still very common today ) to justify the war where the north was on the side of right and history and freedom, 
  fun fact , the united states has the oldest continuous system of government in the world , it is actually older than your country !, 
  well the last guy who got to lead france before he was 40 annexed the netherlands unlikely to happen with macron i grant it is indeed a great advantage of youth that dementia is a far lesser risk than we have with our guy, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ), 
   older than your country interesting timeline you have going there where napoleon became emperor of france and invaded switzerland * before * the united states got independence in 1776, 
  just pointing out that there were economic reasons it persisted , and that france abolished slavery not out of concern for the slaves but because it was felt that feudalism was a better way to manage them and then we in america got rid of feudalism and founded a truly free society , where every man was equal ... at least in theory would you prefer to be a slave in a free society , or a `` free '' man in a monarchy where you were basically owned by the king ? 
  at least slaves in america had an ideal to look up to and a future to look forward to , they could see that they lived in a free society and that it was only a matter of time before the wind of freedom blew into their own persons  it was founded on slavery , genocide and mistreatment of the poor no , it was founded on the idea of freedom , equality and pursuit of happiness slavery and genocide was done by the british and was a holdover from that period , that is what we rebelled against and yes the slavery took a while to finally get rid of but that was the goal and that is what we worked towards ... it was unfortunately not economically viable to free slaves earlier due to the plantation economy of the south , they were necessary for the plantations to be profitable and indeed america abolished slavery well before europe did as we realized that it was wrong , there was widespread slavery in europe within the last hundred years, 
  he 's not referring to the salary, 
  abolished slavery , maybe , because it did n't make economic sense at that stage and feudalism was seen as more * economically * beneficial slavery made more economic sense in the americas and that is why we lagged in abolishing it also we only enslaved black people while in europe when slavery was a thing they enslaved anyone they could , black people for sure if they could get their hands on them but most slaves in europe i think were white people so there was more slavery in europe as it was not limited to black people only then france simply moved from slavery to serfdom which was basically the same thing america was founded on the principal of freedom and equality for all men under god , it 's right there in our constitution unfortunately it took a little while to realize that equality included black people but to our credit we did that and we fought a bloody war , the bloodiest war that has ever been fought on the american continent , for the right of black people to be free like everybody else and gave women the right to vote while in switzerland/france that only happened in 1991 , many people on this thread were probably still already alive then and in switzerland women could not vote and france could have changed that when they controlled switzerland but they did not in america women can vote , they can even run for president !, 
  and now we have true equality while in europe you throw bananas at black soccer players , who are the real progressives here, 
  https://www2.bc.edu/john-heineman/maps/1812label.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_invasion_of_switzerland, 
  a government shutdown is not necessarily a bad thing , if trump was about to push the button and start ww3 would you prefer the government be shut down or not ? 
  the supreme court is one of the three branches of government so obviously it is political  ** political ** relating to the government or the public affairs of a country obviously that includes the supreme court , the great thing about our supreme court rather than courts in foreign countries is that it is political and it is democratically elected ( indirectly ) a non-political supreme court is a non-democratic supreme court and non-democratic is bad , like iran or north korea this is a plus for our system , that we have a democratic , political supreme court , elected by the people, 
  same in france did you know they only gave women fully the vote in switzerland ( which used be part of france and still speaks it in part ) in 1991 ? 
  i think macron seems like a much * better * politician , person , intellect and indeed all round general human being , i would take him over our guy any day much lower chances of dementia in a 39-year old like you say i am just making a point about the * position * , not the * individual * trump is crazy 100 ways from sunday but it is a merit of our constitutional makeup that such a loon is being constrained the system put in place by our omniscient founding fathers four score and four score and four score and one years ago, 
  it 's a democratic * republic * , a democracy with checks and balances but still a democracy , the first and greatest true democracy in the world that inspired those looking to overthrow tyrannical monarchs in the old continent including very much france , whose own revolution and republic was modelled on the example set by america unfortunately they reverted to monarchy pretty quickly and have yo-yoed back and forth since , they are on their fifth republic at this stage while we got it right on the first try i think macron looks like a good guy , obama himself endorsed him , i just hope he does n't let the power go to his head like the last young french leader ( although europe did get forcibly metricated out of that one so it was n't all bad ), 
  having so much power concentrated in one man is very dangerous , even if their heart is in the right place , just look at germany in 1933 . 
  it makes macron a virtual dictator who can do what he likes . 
  who was the last french head of state to take power before his 40th birthday ? 
  macron looks like a good guy , but the temptation is going to be there ... 
  this is , for all our failings , one of the better things about our system , it may seem dysfunctional to outsiders but we have a complicated system of * checks and balances * between the president , congress and supreme court and a knife-edge bipartisan division that rarely results in a supermajority for either party . 
  even when one party takes a firm hold on all three branches of government they still ca n't get anything done . 
  that 's a true democracy . 
  no , but i have read a lot about it , i have some german heritage, 
  you are welcome i hope you voted today for jeremy clarkson might make the place a bit more like denmark, 
  yeah denmark is better though , that 's the point more money more attractive people more equality more solidarity with the unfortunate more empathy more human a country in which `` few have too much and fewer too little . '' denmark is bernie sanders to the uk 's donald trump ... or theresa may which is almost as bad, 
  denmark they have high taxes and socialist wealth redistribution though high level of equality, 
  the options then , it would seem , would be either to ( 1 ) get rid of civil marriage entirely as a legal concept or ( 2 ) have marriage equality . 
  ( 1 ) would be remarkably more disruptive given the plethora of legal rights tied into marital status ... but if we are going to have civil marriage recognized by the state , then imo it has to be equally available . 
  really hard to understand your argument here , are you arguing that every state should get rid of marriage entirely ? 
  fair enough if so and you can campaign for that if that is what floats your boat but in the meantime we should have gay marriage , thanks . 
  no one is forcing `` religions '' to do anything , civil marriage is something entirely distinct from what religions do , no religion is being forced to recognize or perform gay marriages , any more than the existence of civil divorce means that you can get re-married in a catholic church ( you ca n't , as the catholic church does n't recognize divorces ) should divorce be illegal because the catholic church does n't like it ? 
  should extra-marital fucking be illegal because that 's against catholicism ( and indeed many other religions ) ? 
  this is n't sharia, 
  i do n't identify myself as exclusively irish but irish-american , both irish and american , it 's very common indeed there are more irish here than there are in ireland, 
  i 'm irish-american , it 's possible to be both, 
  yes i 'm irish american so both american and irish , this is the thing the two overlap , so my 37.5 % irish is also american , it 's irish american , just like you are scottish and english and british but you are not like 50 % british and 37.5 % english and 12.5 % scottish , the british overlaps just like me being irish and american irish-american, 
  just like me , i 'm more irish than anything so i call myself irish but with some jewish , german , cherokee and scottish ancestry, 
  so you are an british english protestant atheist like i am an irish american catholic atheist ? 
  nothing wrong with that and i do n't hold you personally responsible for british government policy in the nineteenth century obviously but the memory of oppression is deep and so it is a sensitive issue obviously with the irish and i am just suggesting you have some sensitivity, 
  the 62.5 % is a mix of lots of different ancestry , jewish , german , cherokee , scottish ( catholic ) but the irish catholic is the biggest one and the one i primarily identify as although i also treasure all my ancestry and certainly my american indian ancestry which as you say does indeed make me american and i am proud of course to be american but i am irish too the two are not exclusive you can be both like you are english but presumably also see yourself as british ? 
  same thing,
