  well , yes and no . 
  in present times , yes you are completely correct . 
  if a hostile force ever manages to put boots on the ground in the us , it means that there 's probably already been a nuclear war , because that 's just about the only way to pair down the american military . 
  this was n't always the case though . 
  during world war ii for example , isoroku yamamoto ( the japanese admiral who orchestrated the pearl harbor attack ) flat out told the top brass that even if they could somehow defeat the military , an invasion would be utterly impossible for this reason . 
  more integral argument that pro gun advocates make though is probably a fear of the american government . 
  for a very long time , there was very strong belief in the american public that it was a patriot 's * duty * to violently overthrow the government if it ever became too oppressive . 
  today that view has dulled a bit . 
  the obvious counterargument is that in this day and age , the government is just too powerful to overthrow with a motley crew of assorted small arms . 
  in my personal opinion , the counter is true . 
  if say martial law was declared , the civilian population could not stand up to the military . 
  they could however make it painful . 
  even if the populace ca n't win , the potential threat of violence is enough to scare the government from trying anything too extreme . 
  while i personally think that governments should be at least a little afraid of their people ( inb4 v ) , i do n't advocate violence or anything . 
  it 's mostly a theoretical argument . 
  before the shitstorm inevitably arises and we get a bunch of misinformation and strawmen popping up : federally , gun laws in the us are pretty lax . 
  lever action , bolt action , and semiautomatic rifles , shotguns , and handguns are acceptable . 
  caliber and magazine sizes are generally not restricted . 
  machine guns and assault rifles have been banned for decades ( since 1976 iirc ) , baring certain special circumstances . 
  generally , the process is very expensive , time consuming , and requires a decent justification . 
  if one is n't assigned to you for your job , chance are good you wo n't be getting one . 
  in addition , it is generally illegal to modify guns to allow them to fire in a fully automatic manner , and manufacturers who make it easy to modify their weapons in this manner are in violation of the law . 
  in addition , it 's also generally illegal to cut down the barrel of a long gun in order to make it easier to conceal , although the length you can cut down varies ( i think shotgun barrels can be cut down to fifteen inches or so , but do n't quote me on it ) . 
  and before it comes up , no , the `` assault weapons ban '' did not ban the sale or ownership of assault rifles . 
  `` assault weapon '' is terminology which was invented for the brady bill ( the ban ) , and applied to guns which had certain , mostly stylistic , features . 
  its criteria for banning was mostly arbitrary , and pretty much just boiled down to banning things that looked scary . 
  it was largely panned by both republicans and democrats for being a bit pointless , which is why they did n't renew the bill a few years back . 
  states meanwhile can be * much * more strict with their firearms . 
  while they can not officially ban the sale or ownership of firearms , they can restrict the pool of citizens who can own them , and they can restrict the types of weapons which can be owned . 
  in massachusetts for example , in order to get an ltc ( license to carry ) you have to pass a background check ( which takes months ) , register your fingerprints with the state police , attend a gun safety class , and pass a safety test . 
  after all that , you have access to longarms which were allowed under the assault weapons ban , and handguns with magazines which hold six or fewer rounds ( although in my experience , it 's pretty easy to get a waiver to this clause , giving unrestricted handgun access ) . 
  this is one of the strictest states in the country , though some are the complete opposite . 
  in a lot of places , all you need to do to buy a gun in pass an in store background check , if that . 
  am i happy with american gun laws ? 
  i suppose so . 
  not that it much matters . 
  making the laws more functional is basically impossible , because of how easy interstate commerce is . 
  even if one state banned guns completely , you could just cross the border to buy one , and no one would ever know . 
  there are * millions * of guns in the us , and no one really knows where they are . 
  in order to actually keep a leash on gun ownership , you 'd have to abolish all state controls , establish a national registry , and require that every dealer in the nation become affiliated with the government . 
  the only way you could figure out where all of the guns were would be to ban them completely in the country , wait about 40 years or so for the current stock to get too old to be functional , and then reintroduce them for public consumption later on . 
  there is no way a proposal like that would ever get across the board , which is fine by me . 
  numbers do mean a lot . 
  but the days of mountains of soviet soldiers overruning the fields of europe are long past . 
  the russian army is big , but it 's not that big . 
  they outnumber poland 7 to 1 , but that assumes that russia could comitt it 's entire military to fighting just poland , and more importantly , that they * could * fight just poland . 
  attacking poland is an attack on nato , and even if the eu buckles , the american military alone outnumbers the russian military by a pretty wide margin . 
  fuck you , we 'd still have our crack !, 
  you 'll never take that from us !, 
  you never know , maybe he was n't actually a troll . 
  i try to give people on the intertubes the benefit of the doubt . 
  just because he wants something , it does n't mean he 's actually working to make it happen . 
  i want to win the lottery , but not enough to buy a few million tickets . 
  no , just executions . 
  people killed in combat would n't really be an earnest comparison . 
  to tell the truth though , i 'm not sure how many people have been killed by americans in military actions this year . 
  i 'm sure there 's been some , but probably not a ton seeing as we 've mostly been winding down . 
  yes . 
  except for how it 's not an estimate at all , but the exact number . 
  the count is up to 14 now , but that 's because one happened after the picture was made . 
  obvious troll is obvious , but i 'll see what i can do . 
  the idea that problems in other countries are `` not my problem '' is a very common one in american politics , and in the american public . 
  the general feeling among a large chunk of the public is that the rest of the world is filled with sponges and hipocrites . 
  no one wants america around until they need something , and every problem gets blamed on the us . 
  oh , there 's a dictator in africa comitting genocide ? 
  why have n't the americans stopped him ? 
  the us has intervened in a country to depose a dictator ? 
  those damn imperialists !, 
  everyone critiques our warmongering ways , but the only reason that they can say that is because our armed forces have massively subsidized global defense . 
  whether the sentiment is true or not is irrelevant . 
  one of the great things about being in america is that we have exactly zero reasons to give a fuck about what anyone says . 
  we * do * however have many fucks to give about what non-americans actually * do * though . 
  all of the problems brought up , russia , mexico , terrorism are very much our problems . 
  russia taking canada 's arctic territory ( theoretically ) provides russia access to both valuable resources , as well as a foothold on the north american continent . 
  the oceans are our best defense , and letting a hostile power gain a hold on our landmass is a threat . 
  as for radical islam and terrorism , why do we even need this discussion ? 
  we already know , beyond a shadow of a doubt , that these are people interested in hurting america . 
  we know , because it ** already fucking happened ** . 
  our best defense against extremism is to educate at risk people and improve their standards of living , which by default is something you 've got do do in their own country . 
  and of course , mexico is a much bigger security threat to the us than islamist terrorists and russian expansion put together . 
  some of the south american cartels are `` gangs '' in name only . 
  they 've got armed forces composed of hundreds of thousands of soldiers . 
  in many cases they 've infultrated the military , special forces , and government . 
  the reason that in mexico the drug kingpins are always caught by the navy is because that 's the only branch of the mexican armed forces that can be trusted with the task . 
  and this is n't some far away banana republic , this is a large country * that we share a largely unsecured border with * . 
  the us is their primary market , and drug dealers kill innocent american citizens each day . 
  if the mexican government ever totally collapses , we 're going to see a massive rush of immigrants , as well as a huge inflow of dealers and dangerous gang members . 
  all of the propaganda you hear from far right groups about the dangers of immigration is going to look positively liberal in a situation like that . 
  as for that missing jet , the 24/7 coverage is stupid for sure , but there were still americans who went down on it . 
  besides , it 's a good practical test for some of our location equipment . 
  much better to try it out now than to wait to see if it works on a chinese sub . 
  ** tl ; dr ** burying your head in the sand does n't make problems go away . 
  it does n't matter how isolated we try to be , these problems are going to show up to haunt us . 
  we may as well deal with them head on , instead of waiting until they are at our doorstep . 
  and that 's before you look at the moral/ethical reasons to get involved . 
  freedom fries, 
  `` maybe if i throw in enough buzzwords , people will think i know what i 'm talking about ! '', 
  that 's this article . 
  people do n't choose to live in dictatorships because they look at america having it 's credit rating dropped a peg and think that democracy is dead . 
  they live in dictatorships because after decades of oppression , it 's all they know .
