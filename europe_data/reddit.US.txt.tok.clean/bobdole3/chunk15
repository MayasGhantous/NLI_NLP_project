  it 's because after watching your parents get killed by government thugs as a child , you feel a bit skittish about criticizing authority . 
  it 's because people are divided about * real * problems , not just blind partisanship , and that can stall action . 
  this might be a shock , but not everyone that disagrees with your stances is a strawman . 
  `` market leninism '' ( a phrase which avlon does n't actually define ) is n't a choice , it 's just a continuation of a system which a large chunk of the world is used to . 
  even if that shiny new future tech never shows up , it means that we 've still got enough u-235 to power us for the next century . 
  that 's a very long time . 
  if we ca n't manage to improve the productivity of renewable energy resources with a hundred years to work on them , we 've pretty much failed as a species . 
  potato stronk !, 
  you do n't need to personally talk to the president to have a hand in democracy . 
  local governments are almost perpetually understaffed in the country , and there 's often lots of opportunity to get involved . 
  apathy towards the process is the biggest barrier . 
  even if you take the obvious propaganda at face value , it still does n't actually explain why this is somehow the `` corporation '' 's fault . 
  seems to me that the problem is a skills gap . 
  you ca n't just build a house , you need to know * how * to build it . 
  just because you 're willing to work , it does n't mean you 're qualified for the job . 
  or maybe there just are n't enough jobs . 
  i 'm not really sure how this is a european thing though , seeing as the poster from los angeles ca, 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21f3hq/debate_about_an_euarmy/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20n3aq/what_is_reuropes_opinion_on_conscription/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20vymv/what_do_you_think_will_happen_if_russia_invades/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2030bp/what_does_reurope_think_of_the_united_state_of/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1z7syc/xposted_from_rukpolitics_would_we_be_better_off/ that should just about cover every facet of this question . 
  to give you the tl ; dr a united eu military would be more effective by a wide margin , but there 's currently nowhere near enough popular support to make the idea work . 
  even european federalists are split on the issue . 
  a good chunk of europe thinks that a strong military is unneeded ( either because the us already takes care of defense , or because they do n't have anyone they actually need to be protected from ) , and most states are n't willing to cede a massive amount of sovereignty to see it happen . 
  finally , there probably is n't enough of a sense of communal european identity to make it viable . 
  no , you 're baselessly calling people bigots . 
  if there was a black , gay , transvestite who was could run nato operations better than the other competition , they should get the job . 
  the fact of the matter is that , at present , there is no one that fits that category . 
  it 's unfortunate , but that 's the world we live and , and you have to work with what you 've got . 
  the solution is to encourage minorities to work towards high level positions , and crack down on bigotry . 
  the solution is most certainly not to just give them the job based on some misguided notion of civil justice . 
  if we 're talking about ideals , then race and orientation should be nonissues , not a plus or minus . 
  i 'm sure you 're a troll , but i 'll bite anyway . 
  stoltenberg got the job because he was qualified for it . 
  his race and orientation are incidental . 
  now , you are correct in that minorities are systemically disenfranchised , but the solution of this problem , as u/spacemanspiiff points out , is not to arbitrarily hand over the reigns to the largest military alliance in world history to someone based solely on their race or sexual orientation . 
  i got springfield , boston , and worcester for most similar . 
  makes sense seeing as i 've lived in the state for most of my life , but i 'm kind of surprised that they 've got 3 dialects for massachusetts . 
  it 's pretty much just broken up into bahston and not bahston . 
  all the same , i 've heard pretty much all of the choices for most questions used on a regular basis . 
  a lot of the words and even pronunciations get used interchangeably least was new orleans , baton rouge , and jackson , which also seems pretty reasonable . 
  so your argument is that individuals are getting paid too much , but having bureaucracy for the sake of bureaucracy is good because it supplies jobs ? 
  the $ 700k a year ( a rough translation from ~ ~ communism to freedom ~ ~ euros to dollars , i could be off by a fair bit , also assuming that your calculations about their real pay are accurate ) meps get paid is insane , but it 's still a lot less expensive than having entirely redundant levels of government . 
  yeah , worldnews is a pretty terrible place . 
  i 'm never quite sure if it 's filled with idiots , or just really dedicated trolls . 
  that 's assuming that a war would be using conventional forces , which is frankly absurd . 
  the russians are outnumbered , outbudgeted , and outgunned . 
  if things ever go hot , they 're going to have to rely on nuclear weapons , which means there are much bigger problems to worry about anyway . 
  of course , this also overlooks the moral imperative of letting states which were formerly under the oppression of the soviet union live in safety under our protection . 
  now , before i get accused of being a troll , hear me out because i 'm being totally serious . 
  in many cases , the eastern nato members are states which are genuinely seeking protection , an act which thoroughly pisses off their neighbor . 
  if they 're willing to stick their necks out for closer ties with us , we should be willing to return the favor . 
  because this process worked so well with the twitter ban ... 
  do n't get me wrong , i am typically against the government forcing you to do anything . 
  but thinking of this as an issue of liberty is a bit flawed , because the people being effected are n't actually being given a choice . 
  children do n't get a choice in the matter about what they want to do , nor are they capable of understanding the ramifications of their actions . 
  whether they do or do not get vaccinated , they are having an important decision forced upon them against their will . 
  if the law was saying `` all people must be vaccinated '' that would be a different story . 
  if you 're above the age of consent and do n't want to do it , that 's on you . 
  but forcing someone else to * not * get vaccinated based on your own moral stances is bringing harm to another person , and in my ( neckbeard ) opinion is a violation of * their * rights . 
  the eu battle groups are small strike forces , nothing more . 
  with only 2 battalions deployable at any given time , that gives them manpower roughly on par with the police force of a moderately sized city . 
  not to mention that as far as i 'm aware , they have n't been combat tested yet . 
  even if they do work as a cohesive unit ( which we ca n't say for sure until they actually fight something ) , their small size means they 're still not going to accomplish much if a real threat appears . 
  if we can do it , you can too europe !, 
  the fact that speedometers have measurements in km along with mph helps . 
  the counterargument to the 15km vs 120 km is that in a car you 've got a giant metal cage and airbags to protect you from impact , but on a bike you 've got nothing . 
  it 's a terrible counterargument ( people should obviously wear their seatbelts ) , but it 's there . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  wearing a helmet while on a motorcycle is the law in most states . 
  even if it 's not a legal requirement , it 's still hardly uncommon for them to be used . 
  i saw a couple people use it when i was in the uk , but it was n't very commonplace . 
  fucking comcast man, 
  this is a good decision . 
  if an adult wants to make a stupid decision that effects their own health negatively , that 's their prerogative . 
  but a kid ca n't give informed consent to that . 
  you ca n't just join nato , nato has to accept you . 
  and there 's standing policy not to invite states with territorial disputes , especially ones which are being actively invaded by russia . 
  are we sure it 's not `` russia plants evidence of arms smuggling in ukraine '' ? 
  the article is a paragraph long , has a few blatant inaccuracies ( for example , desert eagle and sig sauer are not weapon manufacturers ) , makes no clear statement about the identities and numbers of alleged smugglers , and is pretty vague about the origin of these weapons . 
  further , 40 assorted pistols split between an undefined number of smugglers is hardly indicative of a large ring . 
  would it change how i feel ? 
  not really . 
  you can be a prick and still be right . 
  maybe they could have gone about things a bit differently , and the argument could be made that * some * of the leaked files did legitimately endanger some people , but on the whole , they did the right thing . 
  people should know what their governments are up to , at least in regards to this massive spying debacle . 
  i think that op does n't know what the word `` evidence '' means . 
  pretty much none of the `` blatant scary evidence '' is a new occurrence . 
  most of it 's been going on for * decades * , and most people would probably agree that europe 's better off than it was 30 years ago . 
  even if you do n't agree to that , you 'd be hard pressed to find a credible person claiming that it 's catastrophic . 
  this just sounds like some 70 year old guy crying about how `` kids these days are ruining the world , with their hippy hop music , and i-tables , and vidya games . '', 
  i admit that i was being a bit flippant , but this sort of speaks to my point . 
  most of these countries make the list by way of not having any sort of presence or responsibility on the world scale . 
  they 're not peaceful because they 're good roll models , they 're peaceful because they do n't * do * anything and no one ever asks anything * of * them . 
  most of the list is made up of small , insular countries which sit in the background of the world ( though there are obviously a couple of exceptions , japan probably being the biggest one ) . 
  this is , of course , not even touching how the list itself is generated . 
  some of the criteria are pretty arbitrary and contradictory . 
  so having your own soldiers is bad , but paying for un soldiers is good ? 
  how do you even go about quantifying the value of these things ? 
  the global peace index has pretty much the exact same problems with it . 
  there type of things are n't constructive , they 're just circle jerks . 
  there are two things to keep in mind . 
  one is that protestors do n't need to have a viable alternative to a policy in order to be angry about it .
