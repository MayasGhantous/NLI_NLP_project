  i used that example because russians are quite fond of bringing up nagasaki and hiroshima as examples of american crimes against humanity . 
   your attempt to compare results of soviet occupation to generalplan ost is painfully obvious . 
  no shit , sherlock . 
  both germany and the ussr did/intended to liquidate a significant portion of the latvian population , and germanize/russify the remainder . 
  i put some numbers : 50 % according to generalplan ost , and 13 % actual population decline for 1939-59 ( assuming a baseline zero population growth ) . 
  i already said the german plan was much worse . 
  but you sure as hell can compare the two . 
  i do n't have the actual numbers handy , and even if it is `` only '' 10 % ( [ too low an estimate ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/population-of-latvia.png ) ) , that is still pretty horrific . 
  i do not mean to imply that the 52 % native population is solely due to executions and deportations , rather as an example of russification . 
  what would have germanization have looked like ? 
  thankfully we do not know , though as i have mentioned , it would be much worse . 
  saying latvians - or any other former soviet/communist state - should be grateful to the ussr for `` liberating '' them , is akin to saying the japanese should be grateful for us atomic bombs , because they would have suffered even more destruction and been split into soviet and american occupations otherwise . 
  not to mention that constantly telling them that is really fucking annoying . 
  ask a frenchman how much he enjoys having an american tell him `` if it were n't for us , you 'd be speaking german . '', 
  and lastly , i do not feel bad at all about making my point forcefully . 
  [ recognized ] ( https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/bills-113hres302ih/html/bills-113hres302ih.htm ) , but not much else . 
  according to generalplan ost , 50 % of latvians were to be eliminated . 
  under the ussr , a large percentage of the population was deported , many were executed . 
  in 1989 latvians only comprised 52 % of latvia 's population . 
  so german occupation would have most likely been much worse , but soviet occupation was pretty horrific . 
  nor is it accurate to say that posters here would n't be alive if it were n't for the su - a huge number are n't here to post because of the su . 
  the remembrance is for victims of stalinism ** and ** nazism , so you should do well to remember that stalin cost your country millions of additional lives in your fight against nazism , not to mention all the victims of his political repressions . 
  also , you can take a break from your hatred of the west and remember that without lend lease , things might have gone a lot worse for the soviet union , and remember that the allies could have opted not to declare war on germany , that they destroyed the luftwaffe , sent the kriegsmarine to the bottom of the sea , bombed germany 's infrastructure to smithereens . 
  so yes , we can sure as hell as focus on how both germany and the ussr wronged us . 
  i only said `` observed '' ; `` major holiday '' is something more . 
  should n't it be observed where most of the victims of nazism and stalinism lived ? 
  russia , ukraine , belarus , kazakhstan , and so on . 
  is this even observed anywhere besides the eu , usa , canada , and georgia ? 
  there is a difference between broadcasting factual information where news of it is suppressed as rferl does , and broadcasting straight up bullshit as rt does . 
  nobody 's going to get gulaged over things like associating with non-russians . 
  however , if you 're a journalist uncovering things the authorities would rather people not hear , a politician holding an unpopular position ( such as opposing crimea 's annexation ) or a member of an not-so-loyal opposition party , a whistleblower exposing corruption , then you will need to watch your back . 
  russian intervention in syria did not cause the refugee crisis , but it certainly exacerbated it . 
  constantly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries is very good advice . 
  unfortunately , nobody seems to heed it . 
  btw , congratulations on your engagement !, 
  it 's a pr stunt for consumption on russian media : they get to say how low and mean lithuania is for harassing and banning musicians just because they happen to be russian . 
  yup , ideas such as `` people should be treated the same regardless of the color of their skin '' or `` one should be free to marry the one he or she loves '' have totally caused violent revolution and societies to collapse . 
   consistent effort of the usa to destabilise our region of course this is utter nonsense , but it does illustrate what is wrong with the current russian mindset , as well as the point bigprofessor makes . 
  he said a revolution of ** minds ** . 
  how is that dangerous ? 
  do you mean the general election scheduled for october 2019 ? 
  a lot can happen between now and then . 
  i 'm willing to put my money where my mouth is , and will be more than happy to eat crow if you 're right and i 'm wrong . 
  i am pro-turkey though and he is my president . 
  the lead singer of the dixie chicks said in march 2003 to their london audience : `` we do n't want this war , this violence , and we 're ashamed that the president of the united states ( george w. bush ) is from texas . '', 
  this provoked a enormous backlash among right-wing americans , who supported gwb and wanted the war very much . 
  please do n't make the mistake of thinking that because you are pro-turkey you must also support turkey 's president , particularly when he exercises questionably wisdom which could have a long-term negative impact on turkey . 
  i have to comment as an outsider , but back then i admired him too - a tough , no-nonsense leader who was going to clean up the mess yeltsin left , take out the head-cutters running chechnya , be a strategic partner with the us . 
  but , alas , the warning signs should have been apparent . 
  anna politkovskaya 's _ putin 's russia _ was published 2004 ; kukly was taken off tv in 2002 ; the anthem of the soviet union was reinstated ( which rostropovich would refuse to stand to it ) ; and so on . 
  it seems a fairly recurrent pattern , where an authoritarian figure looks good for the first couple of months or years before their true colors become apparent . 
  there 's a difference between a war game and showing a nation that they can wipe out their central government on short notice . 
  one is a training exercise , the other an act of intimidation . 
  your point ? 
  naw , dobby and gollum are just commiserating on being scorned by the west , and trying to honeydick one another while they are at it . 
  do n't think for a moment they are n't both hiding knives . 
  it should fun to watch the fallout when the bromance is over and one of those knives gets put in the other 's back . 
   having russia as an enemy is strangely comforting to americans [ source ] ( https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/09/19/russia-not-enemy/o0ncduxrxaylliutmqutln/story.html ) . 
  this is an * opinion * piece , and its author kinzer writes  our current campaign against russia was set off by what some in washington call its `` aggression '' against neighboring ukraine . 
  why the quotes around `` aggression '' ? 
  it looks like he 's bought into kremlin propaganda hook , line , and sinker . 
  btw , having russia as an enemy is about as comforting as a cold brick . 
   well , i believe the us never officially declared war on vietnam , did they ? 
  i 'm not 100 % sure . 
  the american dream passed away on 11 june 2015 . 
  rip dusty . 
  in that case , the us was never at war with vietnam either . 
  i just see a photo of athletes posing together without context . 
  it could be just sportsmen like you say . 
  it could be pro-russian ukrainians and russians . 
  it could be anti-war russians and ukrainians . 
  things turned around in [ 98 ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/guides/456900/456974/html/nn1page1.stm ) , but it still takes a few years for people to actually see improvement . 
  putin could not have been more lucky with the timing of his ascendancy . 
  if only it were simply stupidity . 
  that 's because they are all us lapdogs being trained right now to attack russia on command . 
   i know you are . 
  what am i ? 
  they can have a threesome . 
  you wrote :  people like to believe that corruption is worse somewhere else , sheeps dont like to have their worldview shambled . 
  truth is corruption is practiced in large scale almost everywhere be it russia , usa , eu , china and so on . 
  our corruption is more visible because we have free press that will expose it . 
  however per ti , corruption is worse in china than any eu country , and in russia , it is much worse . 
  i was thinking we should tell erdogan to come and get him , but now i 'm thinking the two might have such a good time at one of the posh resorts in the pocono mountains they 'll patch things up . 
  no one denies that corruption exists everywhere . 
  i can read in my own media about officials being under investigation and even indicted under corruption charges . 
  but to assume `` large scale '' corruption in say your country is equivalent to that in , say republic of the congo is just daft . 
  one is a smoothly operating liberal democracy , the other , corruption is absolutely crippling the economy and stifling to civil rights such as a free press and association . 
  noooooo !, 
  not that !, 
  gullen is already on his way to mcguire afb and will fly out today at 1200 edt . 
  do you seriously believe corruption is the same everywhere ? 
  propaganda that works is anything but stupid . 
  just witness how many russians believe their government is entirely innocent , and that the the whole doping scandal is just another western conspiracy to besmirch russia . 
  agreed , though i 've known a few chileans where the animosity was very real . 
  even if it 's a war that russia officially denies involvement in and most russians actually believe the usa is behind ? 
  read the lyrics : https://www.eurovision.tv/event/lyrics?event=2073&amp;song=32773, 
  just some quick googling turns up : http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/upshot/why-so-many-world-cup-fans-dislike-argentina.html https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120126130657aarxcky http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/24/weekinreview/the-world-formerly-arrogant-utterly-argentine.html http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=argentina&amp;defid=6155832 i could also add personal anecdote . 
  of course anecdote is poor evidence . 
  but why even give a shit about insults ( which will most likely get taken down by our friendly neighborhood moderator ) or downvotes . 
  considering the usual fate of russian whistleblowers , stepanova is quite brave , as she might very well be dead right now if she were still in russia .
