  it seems we are always putting the cart before the horse in this respect , we cut and ran from libya as soon as gaddafi was out , we destroyed iraq trying to make it a democracy , and so on . 
  the largest component is from syria , so that would make them bashar al-assad 's war victims . 
  i am quite sure the majority of americans are well aware that their navy uses dolphins . 
  and from western media , just doing a quick google search : [ ** the us navy 's combat dolphins are serious military assets ** ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-navys-combat-dolphins-are-serious-military-assets-2015-3 ) [ ** u.s. navy exercises linked to 3 dolphin deaths ** ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-navy-exercises-linked-to-3-dolphin-deaths/ ) [ ** us navy finally starts replacing killer dolphins with mine-hunting knifefish drones ** ] ( http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/140679-us-navy-finally-starts-replacing-killer-dolphins-with-mine-hunting-knifefish-drones ) [ ** bomb-detecting dolphins : the navy 's secret weapon against iran ? 
  ** ] ( http://theweek.com/articles/478858/bombdetecting-dolphins-navys-secret-weapon-against-iran ) the whole `` killer dolphin '' meme goes back at least to 2012 , when they belonged to ukraine : [ ** report : ukraine trains dolphins with friggin ' pistols on their heads ** ] ( https://www.wired.com/2012/10/dolphins/ ) [ ** ukranian navy training killer dolphins for combat , special ops ** ] ( http://wtvr.com/2012/10/15/ukranian-navy-training-killer-dolphins-for-combat-special-ops/ ), 
   yeltsin represented the west 's interests , not the interests of russians yeltsin represented yeltsin 's interests , nothing more , nothing less . 
   the collapse of ussr was not an accident but well defined policy of yeltsin admin . 
  i 've always been told it was caused by the gorbachev admin . 
  til . 
   yeltsin being the west 's darling for the first time in over 70 years russia and the west could have normal relations , so of course the west would try to cozy up with the russian head of state , no matter who he was , but he was hardly a `` darling '' . 
  and when you have a collapse of government like in the soviet union , there is going to be mass theft and chaos no matter what . 
  putin ( who is just as much a thief as yeltsin was ) came along at just the right time , just when the dust was starting to settle and things had begun to turn around . 
  of course it is easier to blame the west for everything that happened in the 90s . 
  yes look away from the fact that stalin was one of the worst mass murderers in history , yet russians are increasingly looking favorably on him and his portrait can now be found hanging in various law enforcement office . 
  btw , the us navy has been using militarized dolphins since 1960 , so i do n't know what your point is other than provide examples of yellow journalism . 
  just looking at the geography ( say going from burgas through the rhodope mountains and ending at lake vistonida ) , it looks like a colossal engineering project , would be several times the length of the panama canal , and would cost much more than $ 10 billion - by orders of magnitude . 
  if turkey did get out of nato , would we be able to make any kind of trouble for them in the aegean or cypress ? 
  for russia - weaken nato , control over access to the black sea , needs new friends after ukraine crisis . 
  turkey - also needs new friends as relations with west start to chill ; would want to count on russia 's support if any internal conflict started to heat up . 
  erdogan admires putin 's way of running a country . 
  gollum and dobby should get along , they 're both cut from the same cloth . 
  the economist intelligence unit 's democracy index rates the us an 8.05 out of 10 in its 2015 report , where  8 is considered a `` full democracy '' ; we 're straddling the `` flawed democracy '' category , and probably already in that territory . 
  putin probably expects some sort of kickback from trump after all [ this ] ( http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-putin-yes-it-s-really-a-thing ) . 
  you need a free press and viable opposition before you can call elections democratic . 
  and yes , democracy in america is compromised . 
  they have been for as long as i can remember ( going back to reagan ) , this one is probably the most obnoxious however . 
  a year ago everyone was saying he did n't have a chance to win the republican primaries . 
  melania trump 's responsibility as first lady will be to make sure americans never get the two mixed up . 
   ` democratically elected ' and ` democratic ' are n't the same thing . 
  `` one man , one vote , one time '', 
  that sucks . 
  i had tickets on aerosvit , and when all flights were cancelled due to the airline going out of business , they promptly refunded them . 
  things like that make me appreciate an airline much more than their product, 
  til trump is literally erdogan . 
  our constitution is a sacred document respected by left and right alike . 
  it has survived over 200 years , with many crises worse than trump . 
  it can not change except to add amendments , which is very difficult to do . 
  the president is sworn to uphold it . 
  erdogan can pretty do what he like with the turkish constitution . 
  there 's a constitution and checks and balances . 
  he 's only trying to rile up the `` angry white male '' demographic . 
  if he does get elected ( and i really hope he does not ) he will change his rhetoric as he has to face reality , and will end up not doing a thing he said he was going to do . 
  he did n't do something monumentally stupid like yanukovych did reneging on a massive deal he promised his electorate , try to sell his country out to russia , and order a brutal crackdown on those who were protesting this . 
  people would prefer stability than removing him , and would probably end up with someone worse if they did . 
  in the west at least , low approval ratings of leadership are the norm ( and imho a sign of a healthy democracy ) . 
  would n't the fact that you were never part of the soviet union as the baltics were be reason that you would be in much less need of nato than them ? 
  you are right . 
  the conventional wisdom seems to be that if a country has nukes , nobody is going to push them around , let alone invade them . 
  it only works if you have hundreds or thousands of them ready to hit targets around the world . 
  the only reasons nk is n't attacked are that there 's nothing to gain and it would create a gigantic humanitarian crisis that china and sk would have to deal with , as well as astronomical costs incurred in rebuilding a unified korea . 
  there 's no reason to invade india , all the powers are eager to do business with them , and tap their more than a billion person market . 
  having nukes did n't help pakistan after 9/11 when gwb told them `` either you assist us with our war in afghanistan or we will bomb you back into the stone age . '', 
  like losing a big chunk of the eeu to the [ future ] eu ? 
  you should adjust that tinfoil hat , buddy . 
  globalresearch.ca * is * a shit website : amazing they did n't mention haarp , chemtrails , or lizardpeople in the article . 
   so , in my opinion , best way to get insight what 's going on whould be summyrized information from polar sources devided by two . 
  that approach extremly usefull against ` half of the story ' news but it 's not , rather it is an example of the [ middle ground fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument_to_moderation ) . 
  circumcised american men give zero fucks that the procedure was done on them as an infant . 
  what is really fucking annoying is twats who have to constantly tell them that they are mutilated and victims of human rights abuse . 
   never said anything about not voting . 
  sorry , misread you . 
  til young people would not have swayed the brexit vote . 
  so a bad example to illustrate my point . 
   they have no death penalty , for example . 
  true . 
  pesky journalists , whistle blowers , opposition figures just happen to conveniently die . 
  everyone else who votes is also one out of 143.5 million , and surely you 're not alone in the direction you would like to see your country taken . 
  by not voting , your are diminishing the influence of the * ideas * you would like to see implemented . 
  look at the brexit vote - young people in the uk were overwhelmingly in favor of remaining . 
  but they did n't get out the vote , and as a result their side lost . 
  i 'm not saying just getting out the votes is sufficient , but it does get the message to those in power that this is what a lot of people want . 
  this sounds like a cliche , but investors do their homework before putting their money where their mouth is . 
  if they feel ukraine is stable and secure enough to reasonable expect some roi , they will do so . 
  there are lots of places where things will be even cheaper than in ukraine , but if their assets can be seized or whatnot at the whim of the local autocrat , they would be fools to put their money in those places . 
  also , there is a lot of overhead for infrastructure in the initial investments . 
  it 's not like they will be able to pack up and leave as soon as things start to turn sour or cheaper places become attractive . 
  which will never happen with the current russian mindset . 
  maybe in a few generations things will change , maybe not . 
  i need only point out detroit and other `` rust belt '' us cities devastated by the manufacturing sector being moved to asia . 
  i know the government already described stepanova as a `` judas '' ; that klishina is `` sexiest russian athlete '' or something like , but i had no idea she was also a `` traitor '' . 
  really sad , but wo n't ordinary russians at least cheer them on ? 
  edit found klishina ref - http://echo.msk.ru/news/1799686-echo . 
  at least most of the comments there seem to be in support of her . 
   that 's not the case . 
  otherwise giving the blood samples would have been enough . 
  or urine samples . 
  but they do n't exist for russian athletes because of state-sponsored cover ups . 
  you have n't answered my question about how to penalize russia . 
  a strongly written letter ? 
  strip all russian athletes of the medals going back to 2008 ? 
   iaf did not specify how they were approving or banning people . 
  but they did not take any samples for doping testing . 
  i get it . 
  you know better how to do the job than the iaf . 
  every time russia gets caught doing something wrong , it 's just another anti-russian conspiracy . 
   those 2 will compete under russian flag . 
  that 's great . 
  in particular stepanova . 
  i really hope she wins the gold medal . 
  as a whistle-blower exposing wrongdoing , she really should be regarded as a national hero .
