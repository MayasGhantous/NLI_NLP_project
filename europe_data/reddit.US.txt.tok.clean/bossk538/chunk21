  i do n't know clickbait , but the term `` athlete '' causes some confusion . 
  in american usage , an athlete means anyone participating in sporting events , but in british usage ( is this correct ? ), 
  it only applies to those participating in track and field events . 
  russian athletes who can prove they are clean are allowed to compete , just not under the russian flag . 
  if we have state-sponsored cheating , how do you punish the state ? 
  if stepanova or klishina win gold medals , wo n't they still be welcomed home as heroes ? 
  also the russian state destroyed a lot of evidence of doping , as well as ensured that athletes never got tested . 
  so there is no way to ever know which russian athletes were doping : with other countries , anti-doping agencies have access to urine samples , so they can independently test them , or perform new tests as techniques improve ; with russia , the samples are missing , or contain someone else 's urine . 
   why does the iaaf not allow athlets to get checked & cleared by different organisations ? 
  they can , but they have to compete as neutrals . 
  more recent history indicates that russia attacks its neighbors . 
  leave russia alone , but protect its neighbors .

  was there much popular support for joining nato back then ? 
  and even if there was , russia would not quietly let that happen . 
  missile shields in poland do not negate mad , or even put a dent in it for that matter . 
   is that like sadams imaginary wmds ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_in_the_kosovo_war  [ snip ] that 's quite an imagination you have there for someone who has posted for the first time on reddit not even an hour ago . 
  than make that stopping the genocide of kosovar albanians . 
  thanks for the correction , and my turn to correct you : killing civillians , bombing schools and hospitals is a war crime when done * intentionally * . 
  not op , but not just one real reason , but several : those outlined in the `` clean break '' report ( israeli security via regime change in hostile neighbors ) ; having a pro-us/uk government installed in an oil-rich country ; personal vendetta against saddam hussein . 
  in the uk , support for the war was [ 54 % ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/03/remembering-iraq/ ) ( in the usa it was 63 % in support ) . 
  interestingly , the there seems to be some widespread amnesia among those who supported the war : in 2015 , only 37 % recall having been in support of the war . 
   right , and the aftermath of removing saddam was totally worth it . 
  i would wager that very few people - even those who were against the war from the beginning - accurately foresaw the outcome . 
  because if the public had the real facts , there would be quite a bit less support for the invasion . 
  stopping the bosnian genocide is a war crime according to serbian nationalists . 
  from the article / u/thomanou linked , more than 20 million americans travel to mexico every year , and 12 million to canada . 
  caribbean islands probably get a big share as well . 
  just that it 's a lot more convenient and inexpensive to do so , than visiting the uk and other european destinations . 
  edit - a word, 
   we are protected by russia protected from what ? 
  i never said you are a putinbot . 
  i do believe you get most of your information from russian tv , however . 
  i suspect u/nk-ak does n't speak for the vast majority of georgians , and his sympathies lie to the north at any rate . 
  nato 's involvement in the balkan conflicts is justified in that it put an end to ethnic cleansing . 
  nothing comparable existed in moldova , crimea , or 2008 georgia . 
  i really was n't hoping for a regime change , just recognition by ordinary russians that their government is waging a war of aggression against their neighbor , and that it is covering up its involvement in the downing of mh17 . 
  but i suppose patriotism trumps common sense . 
  and their will to do it is pretty much nonexistent . 
  scottish voters made the right choice twice , and got screwed over for it .

   source both levada and kiis often display data side by side on their sites . 
  here is their results : do you agree that there is a war going on between russia and ukraine ? 
  | russia ( levada-center ) | ukraine ( kiis ) --------- | ---------- | ---------- yes | 25 | 63.0 no | 65 | 17.9 difficult to say / do not know | 11 | 19.1 total | 100 | 100 http://kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=609&amp;page=1, 
  unfortunately will probably not get to visit anytime soon :( since you are in the us , could you recommend some wines that are available here ? 
  would you find bucuria at russian grocery stores here ? 
  any restaurants ( particularly in nyc ) ? 
  you can be called a patriot , anti-american , left winger , right winger , or racist depending on the affiliations of the person you are asking . 
  the same levada poll found that about 80 % ( levada is blocked at my work , going by memory ) of ukrainian residents said there is war between russia and ukraine . 
   most people understand quite well what russia is doing in ukraine , including direct military activities so they approve ? 
   still not a war , even ukrainian official name for this is `` anti terrorist operation '' . 
  official designation of the korean war was a `` police action '' ; war was never declared on vietnam . 
  along with the ukrainian conflict , these are all wars . 
   neocons ? 
  if i had to situate myself somewhere in the political spectrum it would be quite far from those guys . 
  of course american neocons have an interventionist foreign policy and actively promote american interests abroad . 
  the current political establishment in the rf would be pretty accurately characterized as russian neoconservative . 
  nothing good has come of either one . 
  that 's my issue with the title . 
  `` state television '' that will only be seen by very few russians . 
  within the rf , state television has near monopoly control in which to tell people what to think ; outside the rf , rt and sputnik have to compete with all the other media organizations . 
  i want russians to know that they are indeed at war with ukraine , which their government instigated and continues to lie to them about . 
  most ukrainians ( as do most people everywhere outside russia ) are well aware that russia is at war with ukraine . 
  not all wars are declared . 
  i 'd say he 's hardly keeping it under control . 
  maybe when all syrians who do n't want him are dead or fled he will have things under control at last . 
  that would be putin 's wet dream , he would then just steamroll ukraine , and get a land bridge to crimea , and maybe even keep going all the way to izmail . 
   they even managed to drag sweden into libya otherwise , libya might be another syria . 
  you wo n't find very many libyans who want gadaffi back either . 
   at this point nobody needs to be conviced that russia invaded ukraine according to levada , only 26 % of russian residents agree there is a war between russia and ukraine . 
  the poll is old ( 8/2014 - i do n't have access to more recent right now ) , so there are probably quite a lot of people who still needs to be convinced . 
  family members and friends who live in lithuania . 
  personal experience during visits before and after the adoption of euro . 
  stories about the cauliflower revolution , opening lidl , etc. 
  is that what happened in lithuania with the big jump in prices experienced there ? 
  you would think by `` russian state television '' the authors meant channel one or russia-24 , as rt is directed at audiences outside the rf . 
  it 's also a lot weaker . 
  without severing ties , russia is pretty much free to buy , extort , blackmail ukrainian politicians , oligarchs , business people and other power brokers to serve russia 's interest over ukraine 's . 
  it seems putin has dismantled all checks and balances and created a power vertical with him at the top , which he can hold for only so long . 
  things are going to get ugly when his hold inevitably gets broken . 
  and this is the system he has voluntarily created .
