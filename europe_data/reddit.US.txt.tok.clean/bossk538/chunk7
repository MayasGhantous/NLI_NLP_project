  seriously ?!, 
  there are no popular gay clubs left in moscow ? 
  not a problem for the russian government . 
  they all will be fine and can simply blame the sanctions on the us and its puppets in the eu . 
  good work , but looks like it is an uphill battle . 
  from the article :  despite the efforts of activists like sergeyev , pseudoscience is playing a greater role than ever in the lives of russians . 
  oliver stone, 
  how ? 
  i think ( am on mobile ) the who ranks healthcare in russia and nigeria the same . 
    supported the muslim protests against them  wait , what ? 
  see [ 1 ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-17/putin-points-muslim-rage-at-cold-war-foes-as-jihadis-vow-attacks ) and [ 2 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-protests-chechnya-declares-holiday-for-rally-against-prophet-mohamed-cartoons-as-angry-9990339.html ) . 
    if russia is inimical to core french values , i would think they are a `` hostile country '' . 
   like saudi arabia is to us , right ? 
  yes . 
  what point are you trying to make ? 
  most americans consider the ksa as an exporter of oil and terrorism . 
  if the saudis were financing a political party in the us , there would be a massive backlash . 
  how compatible are french and russian values ? 
  how supportive is russia of libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 ? 
  russian media has said the charlie hebdo cartoons should never have been allowed to be published , and supported the muslim protests against them . 
  russia does not value democracy or free speech , particularly press freedom . 
  if russia is inimical to core french values , i would think they are a `` hostile country '' . 
  they annihilated the ukrainian military at ilovaisk and debaltseve , so i would n't underestimate the russians abilities either . 
  international politics are dictated by those who have the military to enforce their will . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  so which conflict has the us been involved in with no mention of civilian casualties in us ( or western ) media ? 
  edit - there is really nothing else to say to fuckmyorangs 's ludicrous claims , except he really should provide some citation for his statement about the ghouta attacks . 
  that should be fun to see if and what he comes up with . 
   assad [ ... ] might be the greatest statesman of this century . 
  someone who uses chemical weapons and cluster bombs against civilian populations ? 
  someone who uses anti-aircraft weapons against protesters - who were not violent up to that time ? 
  you can check out his rap sheet with any human rights organization . 
  he might not be as bad as isis or al-nusra , but that 's his whole strategy - eliminate anyone better than himself , and the world will have no other choice but support the lesser evil . 
  some statesman indeed !, 
  keep on drinking the kool-aid . 
  you do n't seem to know the difference between propaganda and reality . 
  syrian elections are a farce . 
  i suppose the 2011 protests were organized by the west and the ghouta chemical attacks were carried out by the fsa . 
  have british-argentine relations improved since horse face left office last december ? 
  you forgot to add assad to your list as he is also against the majority of syrians as well, 
   they are n't traitors . 
  you yourself said they hate russia and russians . 
  what are they then ? 
   they are powerless unliked marginals who 's political goals are completely misaligned from the wishes of the people . 
  their support within russia is non existant you do n't think the fact that independent media is practically non-existent in russia , and that direct criticism of the president or his policies is forbidden in the news have anything to do with that ? 
  tl ; dr : liberals in russia are traitors who want to destroy the country . 
  i do n't think there 's much point in arguing with you , but know that i genuinely feel sorry for you . 
  i guess there are really too many to list . 
  so i 'll limit my self to cellists ( being a cello person myself ) , one per country : spain ** pablo casals ** portugal ** guilhermina suggia ** france ** pierre fournier ** russia ** mstislav rostropovich ** austria ** heinrich schiff ** germany ** alban gerhardt ** hungary ** janos starker ** czech republic ** milo\u0161 s\u00e1dlo ** italy ** antonio janigro ** uk ** jacqueline du pre ** lithuania ** david geringas ** latvia ** mischa maisky ** norway ** truls m\u00f8rk ** netherlands ** pieter wispelwey ** sweden ** mats lidstr\u00f6m ** finland ** arto noras **, 
   how many seats do communists of usa have in the senate ? 
  every ballot sheet/voting booth i 've seen in the usa has candidates for the communist party . 
  however given that communism has brought death and misery to so many millions , and proven itself economically unsustainable , it is no surprise that they hardly get any votes . 
   i ' [ ... ] do n't fallow their news other than once a month [ ... ] they genuinely hate the country and the people of russia . 
  right . 
  they are a fifth column and traitors just like they keep banging over and over in the state media . 
   imagine if in us there was a party or movement that was running on concept that [ ... ] everything the us does is wrong . 
  that 's a strawman , since no one is saying everything russia does is wrong . 
  americans recognize there are lots of problems in society like health care , gun violence , racial tensions , and so on . 
  there is a lot of resistance , but there are lots in leadership positions fighting to make it a better place , and slowly but surely , the tide is turning in their favor . 
  what does the kremlin do , piss on citizens shoes and have the national media tell them it is raining ? 
  or blame the usa and traitors for all their problems ? 
   biggest oposition parties in russia are all parties that are either as hostile and agressive or even more so . 
  that 's why there is a term `` loyal opposition . '', 
  zhirinovsky is actually useful in that he can try out a lot of ideas/rhetoric and if they 're too wacky , the united russia party can safely disown them . 
  what is the breakdown among russians who believe everything they see on channel one/russia -24 / lifenews and those who do not ? 
  cecilia bartoli and maurizio pollini are also quite popular . 
  does jascha heifetz count as a lithuanian classical musician ? 
  ravel does n't make the short list ? 
  edit : also , for musicians rather than composers , jean-pierre rampal was a houshold name here . 
  how about all those conductors : * ern\u0151 dohn\u00e1nyi * antal dor\u00e1ti * ferenc fricsay * istv\u00e1n kert\u00e9sz * arthur nikisch * eugene ormandy * fritz reiner * georg solti * george szell i do n't think any country has produced as many conducting giants as hungary !, 
  and do n't forget einojuhani rautavaara !, 
  op - your country does n't have a lot ? 
  just off the top of my head jaap ter linden bob van asperen eduard van beinum frans br\u00fcggen anner bylsma pieter wispelwey willem mengelberg bernard haitink edo de waart ton koopman and the soon to be music director of the new york philharmonic jaap van zweden and not a contemporary musician , but one of the most influential composers of all time : jan pieterszoon sweelinck . 
  which german media regularly interviews conspiracy theorists , anti-semites , and people with an ax to grind concerning the west ? 
  no , it 's been holding between 75 and 80 to the dollar ( or around 85 per euro ) throughout 2016 . 
  from wikipedia ( criticisms ) :  in 2007 russian government accused the research institute of spreading anti-russian propaganda by hosting a debate on violence in the russia 's turbulent region of ingushetia . 
  according to a statement by the foreign ministry of russia : `` organisers again and again resorted to deliberately spreading slander about the situation in chechnya and other republics of the russian north caucasus using the services of supporters of terrorists and pseudo-experts . 
  speakers were given carte blanche to spread extremist propaganda , incite ethnic and inter-religious discord . 
  '' [ 24 ] the jamestown foundation responded by saying that russia felt threatened by it and was trying to intimidate it . 
  foundation president glen howard claimed that `` they 're intimidated by the power of the free word and this goes against the state manipulation of the media in russia . '', 
  sounds like they 're only guilty of providing information the kremlin would rather have supressed . 
  because with russia it is well documented , and blatantly obvious ( look what has happened to bbc 's hys or moscow times comment section since euromaidan started for example ) . 
  i 'm not sure why you bring serbs into this . 
  i see no evidence that serbia engaged in astroturfing , and i welcome their perspective as well . 
  edit : to be clear , i do n't consider any of the regular russian redditors trolls . 
  i 'm talking about / r/worldnews comments that mysteriously get massively upvoted/downvoted within a couple hours , or the numerous new accounts that pop up on / r/ukrainianconflict all the time , passing pro-kremlin comments . 
  obviously not a coincidence . 
  but it sounds like you consider that a bad thing . 
  i do n't think turkey is astroturfing reddit , just a big international incident that got a lot of turks interested in forums such as those , and i certainly welcome their perspective and discussion , even if i do n't agree with everything i hear . 
  maidan vs pegida - one is against corruption and for european ideals , the other a far-right neo-nazi group . 
  the two are not equivallent . 
  you 're grasping at straws . 
  if reality ca n't compete with the russian state media apparatus , there 's nothing i can say that 'll change your mind . 
  russians deserve better than that pos occupying the kremlin , and i will not be gloating when you wake up at last . 
  it was falling starting 2000 q4 and , and bottomed out dec 2001 or jan 2002 - not quite falling from 2000 to 2004 - and still above 90s levels during that entire time . 
  a little hiccup does n't disprove the overall trend of the russian gdp following the price of oil . 
  more like real results to show for what happens in a petrostate during a tenfold increase in the price of oil . 
  i 'm sure ilostmyoldaccount 's comment was directed at the government of russia - particularly their state media apparatus - and not the citizens . 
  there was a skit on channel one a few days ago , saying america has schwarzenegger ( showing the terminator ) , russia has kadyrov ( looking sufficiently badass ) . 
  i do n't really know the point ( arnold plays one , ramzon * is * one ? ),
