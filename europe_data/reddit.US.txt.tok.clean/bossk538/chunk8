  but it raises the possibility that kadyrov actually is putin 's enforcer ( in the mafioso sense ) . 
  correct . 
  moreover , the - ize ending is the older spelling in english [ usage ] ( http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2011/03/ize-or-ise/ ) . 
  besides which the z is a transliteration of the greek zeta , and is also consistent with english phonology , while the s is not . 
   he 'll never get a job knowing javascript  ... go learn python op [ quatsch ] ( http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2016/ ) . 
  ivanow provided some examples , as did i for business in crimea . 
  also , i did n't specify russia as a `` near certainty '' ; i only pointed out that risks vary greatly from country to country , though we all know which end of the spectrum russia is closer to . 
  if anyone feels that the risks are overstated , they are free to invest as much as they like in the said companies should they become privatized . 
  as for me , no thanks . 
  right , forced nationalization totally did n't occur in [ crimea ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-11-18/crimea-gets-renationalized ) . 
  now go have your mum change your nappy , it 's full . 
   that risks exists in every country in the world in some country those risks are only a theoretical possibility , in others a near certainty . 
  it even got the mst 3000 [ treatment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvpoaebtr7w ) over here . 
  it seems that support for putin is also [ falling ] ( http://echo.msk.ru/news/1701898-echo.html ) ( also a levada poll ) . 
  the comments are quite an interesting read , btw , 
   most people , including the russians i know , take russian media with a big grain of salt . 
  please inform my family and in-laws for whom russian media are the only ones telling the truth about what is happening in the world , and that western media is brainwashing people with cover ups , falsifications , russophobia , and us state department propaganda . 
  can confirm - there is a polar bear club in nyc whose members jump into the atlantic every new years day . 
  it seems like there is a widespread belief among russians that exposure to cold will cause all kinds of health problems , drinking cold water will make you sick , and so on . 
  are the morzhi exceptions to the rule or do they make an exception for ice swimming ? 
  has there ever been an atrocity committed that russia did * not * see a western plot ? 
  no one thinks their own leaders are n't corrupt , other than a few fanbois and fanatics . 
  however there are degrees of corruption , such as the levels in norway vs the levels in zimbabwe . 
  gaddafi had a `` no-fly zone '' imposed over libya . 
  i 'm sure assad would have been gone just as quick , if not sooner , had one been imposed over syria . 
  not too long ago there was a [ study ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21607830-more-people-are-exposed-socialism-worse-they-behave-lying-commies ) reported in the economist that suggested that people who grew up in communism tended to be more dishonest than those who grew up with capitalism in germany . 
  so if the official count is 600k and the moscow times estimates 1 million , the actual number is should be closer to 2 million . 
  if you only have 693 partners , you already have a 50/50 chance of being infected with hiv . 
  those books sound like an excellent read !, 
  have you read them ? 
  `` the worst is not . 
  so long as we can say ` this is the worst . ' '', 
  even if oil does rebound , it 's not going back over $ 100 a barrel anytime soon , and sanctions are still on , as well as putin 's kleptocracy . 
   people 's mood is hitting a new low how would you explain the seeming contradiction according to [ this ] ( http://mashable.com/2016/01/20/rubles-plunges-by-russians-are-happy/#g3uzyfucksqb ) , which quotes a poll suggesting russians are now happier than ever ? 
  according to the 2012 pisa results russia is tied with slovakia in maths for 34th place ( just above the usa ) and is in 37th place for science . 
  just from personal anecdotal evidence , the majority of europeans working in the usa in stem jobs come from formerly communist eastern european countries , and since russia is by far the largest of them , it 's really hardly surprising there are lots of russia working in the us in stem related jobs . 
  i would guess that economics and living standards are the primary motivators , but this really biases the sample - the best and the brightest tend to be the ones who get employed abroad . 
  i believe it is `` krim '' in both russian and ukrainian . 
  however i 've only ever seen ukrainians using `` crimea '' when writing in english , while russian nationalists prefer `` krim '' . 
  pay for what , another referendum ? 
  i really would n't mind if a transparent and fair referendum were held , and it was to the satisfaction of both russia and ukraine , as well as minorities in crimea . 
  however , it ai n't gon na happen . 
  certainly not this year , where the cost of vacations is expected to rise [ 30 % ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article.php?id=556281 ) . 
  maybe in 2017 , russians will have more money to spend on vacations , while turkey and egypt will still be off limits to them . 
  well at least we know where your sympathies lie . 
  it 's always refreshing to hear when the duma actually gets something right . 
  how about they hold another referendum to decide if they want to rejoin ukraine or be independent ? 
  oh , that 's right , it 's illegal to propose that now , is n't it ? 
  sarcasm duly noted . 
  you do not need a particular argument to refute a child . 
  if the cookie jar is empty , with crumbs all over the counter and your 4-year-old denies taking them , you can counter by pointing out the cookies did n't just grow legs and walk away , leaving their trail . 
  same with refuting griffinsgriff by pointing out what he just wrote when he claims he did n't . 
  also , not that he disingenuously edited his comment after i replied ( he only had the first paragraph where he called me `` stupid '' and `` ignorant '' ) . 
  the arguments he makes are all specious , but there is n't any point in responding to anything he says again , ever . 
   either we judge both [ ... ] or we do n't . 
  anyway , how old are you ? 
  i only ask this so i can tag you and , for future reference , know when i am arguing with a child . 
  how nice . 
  nobody from the west is allowed to criticize anything russia does unless they enumerate everything unsavory the west has ever done first ( with particular attention on the usa ) . 
  so let me get this straight : the interviewer asks putin about `` bombing the wrong people '' to which putin immediately deflects with a `` what about americans bombing a hospital in afghanistan '' and that makes me a hypocrite for pointing out the evasion because i 'm american and the american government breaks the rules . 
  you must be proud of your powers of reasoning , professor . 
  if i were albanian , i would go with enki bracaj . 
  there seem to be a lot of people from the congo republic that have positive feelings for france . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're critiquing putin 's application of whataboutism or my calling it . 
  anyway , there are many statements made by putin in this interview that show just how intellectually dishonest the man is . 
  are n't the sanctions targeted against specific individuals and businesses though ? 
  are they - and not other factors such as the price of oil - really hitting average russians much more than their intended targets ? 
  ** putin ** : [ ... ] what about the us pilots who bombed a hospital of `` doctors without borders '' in kunduz , afghanistan ? 
  many people died there , but the western press is not saying anything about it . 
  ** bild ** : no , there was extensive coverage in many newspapers and magazines . 
  ** putin ** : well , maybe it was mentioned a few times in the press , but only because foreigners were among the victims . 
  then the incident was quickly forgotten again . 
  and nice to see putin 's lie about western press quickly dispensed . 
  i wonder if mr. putin actually believes the things he says ? 
  is this `` cultural centre '' at least controversial locally ? 
  because / u/imtoki is lithuanian , and under stalin 's policies a significant portion of the lithuanian population was sent to gulags , many thousands more were imprisoned , tortured , and executed for political reasons , that lithuania was russified and their own culture was supressed ? 
  in my experience too it 's up to the homeowner here , and pretty mixed up . 
  reading this topic it looks like for european countries in the north and east it 's take them off , and in the south and west it 's leave them on . 
  and if enough people have your attitude , a repeat of past events is an inevitability rather than a mere possibility . 
  it 's a failure to acknowledge history , and obtain any sort of reconciliation with the victims of said genocide . 
  it also raises the possibility that the same course of events could be repeated . 
  i certainly wish they could do it and make ukraine a resounding success story , but have a lot of doubt it will actually happen . 
  why are you so optimistic ? 
  what countries have made public statements that they could occupy or destroy another country , but do n't because the cost is too high ? 
  that 's a peculiar line of reasoning , along the lines of `` i could beat the little old lady who lives next door into a coma , but the jail time i would have to serve would make it not worth my while '', 
   russia could have occupied the whole of ukraine if they wanted to . 
  and face a massive insurgency , with the backing of the us , eu , and others , suffering thousands of casualties each month , an enormous financial drain . 
  and even the most patriotic russians will start to question the kremlin why it is sending so many of their young men to die in a foreign country . 
  it could very well could have caused the rf to collapse . 
  take a look at your pay stub , and you should see at least several hundred dollars deducted for medical insurance each month . 
   americans , they do n't hate you for your freedom . 
  they hate us 'cause they anus . 
  is it possible that the ukrainian orthodox church could switch to the gregorian calendar ? 
   his critique is not of the nature that you think it is i really have no idea what his critique is . 
  the article is pretty vague - the court accuses him of urging people to `` overthrow the authorities '' and `` take hostile actions against the ukrainian refugees '' , but makes no citations of what he actually wrote . 
  if he did n't criticize the russian intervention in ukraine , would he have been still charged ? 
  anyway , calling for the expulsion of ukrainian refugees makes him an asshole , but a criminal ? 
  also vaccines are not 100 % effective - chickenpox vaccination prevents 95 % of moderate cases . 
  however anti-vaxers should note that not being 100 % effective does not mean you should skip it , since just a modest effectiveness could make the difference between the disease spreading through a population or quickly dying out in a population . 
  but if russians are convinced by their media that the us , along with its puppets in the eu , are russophobes trying to destroy russia and the reason that their paychecks are shrinking , do n't you think their anger will be directed at the west rather than their own government ?
