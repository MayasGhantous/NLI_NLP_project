1980 's , swedish pop somehow never went out of style there parallel indeed, 
  if he would n't have done something to put a stop to the civil war in syria , then i think that he 'd be every bit as useless & incompetent at a dealing with this problem as present-day european leaders are . 
  what you guys need is a leader like wilson . 
  mexican civil war getting out of hand , and causing spillover & border raids in `` murica ???? 
  sends pershing . 
  sends patton . 
  or better yet a leader like clinton . 
  coup in haiti threatens to send thousands of refugees our way ???? 
  --  sends usmc . 
  yugoslav civil war pissing off our allies ( who are too pussy to do anything about it themselves ) ??? 
  --  tells milosevic to go suck on a laser-guided smart-bomb . 
  all while getting his dick sucked . 
  the best comparison to european historical leaders i think , would be the foreign policy of the 19th century czars . 
  when shit started falling apart in either austria-hungary , ottoman europe , or the balkans , imperial russia 's typical response would be to decide what they wanted to see happen in their neighborhood , and then send cossacks . 
  see the napoleonic wars and the 1848 hungarian revolution for examples . 
  they understood where problems began , and has ideas about how to put a stop to them . 
  ok . so tell the turks no deal , and deal with the syrian situation yourselves . 
  i 'm pretty sure that insulting me is n't gong to magically make syria not a part of europe 's near-abroad . 
  by definition , if internal developments in that country or region can affect the internal situation in your country . 
  then it 's the `` near-abroad '' . 
  sticking your head in the sand is n't going to change that . 
  neither is shooting the messenger . 
  at some point , you dudes are going to have to learn that if your neighbor 's house catches fire , the flames might cause you problems too . 
   if they would apply the law , yeah ... here 's another lol-worthy part of it . 
  the sad fact is that you guys do n't actually have the resources to do any such thing . 
  the italian navy said as much last year . 
  not enough boats . 
  not enough personnel , not enough budget . 
  i spent part of last summer living along the med near the french/italian border . 
  i watched the french try to pull that though `` nobody 's getting in here '' shtick . 
  too bad that they only had like 200 gendarmes to patrol the entire border ( that 's way too few to actually do anything meaningful against refugees who have already taken the decision to risk their lives over this ) . 
  so yeah . 
  you can shoot the messenger , but this is still a big fat lol . 
  you can lol all you want i suppose . 
  after all , you 're the guy from a country close enough to the conflict zone that refugees can literally walk there . 
  it takes 2 weeks or so , i hear . 
  all i have to say is that if this happened in a some country anywhere remotely near the us , we 'd have troops/peacekeepers/drones / something there ** in a hot second ** . 
  that 's why the monroe doctrine specifies the entire western hemisphere . 
  do you remember when we sent troops to haiti in 1996 ? 
  yeah , that 's because haiti is rafting distance to the florida coast . 
  so , it was either us troops in haiti , or dead haitian refugees washing ashore in florida ( only 2 in 3 actually survive the journey ) . 
   if it was about safety , they 'd stay in countries nearby . 
  they literally travel through a shit ton of countries to come to germany or sweden . 
  yeah , that 's what we tell the haitians too . 
  in principle , they could set sail for cuba , dr , or bahamas . 
  all of those are closer . 
  that does n't stop them from trying for the us everytime shit goes down over there . 
  wan na know what does ? 
  ** usmc does ** ( so do un peacekeepers for that matter ) . 
  we chose to handle things one way ( by dealing with the source of the problem ) . 
  you chose to handle them a different way ( by pretending that doing nothing whatsoever has zero consequences ) . 
  enjoy the consequences of your decisions . 
   since when is a civil war in north africa our responsibility ? 
  when it happens so close to your country that its repercussions are felt domestically . 
  why do you think we have the monroe doctrine ? 
  why do you think that we intervened in the mexican revolution ? 
  i 'd have thought that you guys would have learned this in bosnia . 
  or if not ... then in kosovo . 
  also , do us a favor and do n't call us to bail you out until after you finish learning this basic lesson of geostrategic realpolitik . 
  countries that matter actually care about what happens in their neighborhood because of shit like this . 
  simple as that . 
  why ? 
  would he have sent troops go tell isis and or assad to stfu ? 
  would he at least have shared his tasty , tasty vodka ? 
  that 's the price of turkey 's cooperation in helping you manage the consequences of the syrian civil war , which you could have done sometthing about in 2011 before it got out of hand . 
  you can add that to the list of things that you dudes should have thought about when deciding to ignore the situation in syria back in 2011 . 
  or you could just let in more poles and slovaks to balance things out . 
  enjoy !, 
  as is being said elsewhere on this thread , that 's the price of turkish cooperation with containing the consequences of the syrian civil war . 
  you can add that to the list of things that you dudes should have thought about when you were busy saying that syria was n't you problem , and that you were n't going to be doing anything about it . 
  enjoy . 
  you can put that on the list of things that you guys should have thought about when you were busy ignoring the fact the the european neighborhood was burning . 
  if your country 's leaders feel that this is a mistake , i highly suggest hopping into a time-machine , going back to 2011 , and convincing all eu leaders to deal with syria ** before ** it bursts into flames . 
  or , i suppose that it 's also possible to tell the turks ** no deal ** , and simply repeat the events of the summer of 2015 . 
  for the next several years . 
  sometimes choices are tough . 
  did you read what i said at all ? 
  what i just told you you was that when bad things happen to sikhs ( at least when i live/have lived ) , it 's usually far-right extremist violence . 
  you keep trying to change the subject . 
  but instead , you should just read all the article i linked , so that you can ** really ** see what 's going on out there . 
   i get it some dumb rednecks in america commit hate crimes against sikhs . 
  not sure what your source is . 
  in america , there are seven of these , for every action done by any sort of muslim . 
  but then again , when i lived in prague , apparently , my roommate busting open the face of 2 or three drunken , idiotic , local skin-heads was officially recorded as an `` alcohol-related accident '' by the local cops . 
  an accident that happened to their faces . 
  repeatedly . 
   no oh really ? 
  you do n't think that there is a problem with xenophobic extreme right extremists being too dumb to tell sikhs and muslims apart ? 
  i wonder how long it would take google some up . 
  - [ in new york  ( http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015-12-31/sikhs-become-a-casualty-of-anti-muslim-actions ) - [ in chicago  ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sikh-attacked-in-chicago_us_55f1a8aae4b093be51bdddb3 ) - [ in wisconsin  ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/28/mass-shooting-sikh-americans-oak-creek-wisconsin ) - [ in the uk  ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/uk-sikhs-remain-invisible-victims-anti-muslim-hate-crime-1510588 ) any questions ? 
  personally , i had a british sikh roommate when i lived in prague . 
  he got in fights with local skin-heads at least three times in the semester that i lived there . 
  needless to say , those local scum got what was coming to them . 
  in america , most hate crimes committed against sikhs are done as acts of extreme-right terrorism . 
  the thing is , the perpetrators usually profess that they were actually trying to kill muslims . 
  it turns out that many , many people are just to dumb/ignorant to be able to tell the difference . 
  so , ** violent and stupid xenophobic violence ** is what hate crimes against the sikh community usually come down to . 
  wow ... this certainly blew up . 
  yes , you do make a strong point there . 
  my main point was that mostly that claims about this being more of an economic thing than a political thing are directly challenged by the fact that around 85 to 90 % % of all the refugees in 2015 ( according to unhcr ) came from either a conflict zone ( syria , iraq , afghanistan ) , or from eritrea,
