  whether it 's yugoslavia at war with itself or syria at war with itself ... the results appear to be similar . 
  except that one of the main warring factions is also trying to hit foreign targets . 
  that is something that milosevic never dared to try . 
  i 'm saying that instead of taking action ( like you did in bosnia after we started helping you ) , you guys have decided instead for the fate of europe to be decided by events in libya , syria , and iraq . 
  russia takes steps to manage its near abroad . 
  and so do we . 
  and so does china . 
  europe is the odd one out . 
  20 years ago , you guys all decided that events in europe were n't to be decided by events in yugoslavia . 
  but apparently this time around , it 's different . 
  the previous guy says it 's a problem of bleeding hearts . 
  imo , it 's more a problem of bleeding vaginas . 
   as a german , i would say we handed our balls in right after ww ll it would have been helpful if you had [ refrained from selling arms to the conflict in the balkans ] ( http://128.121.186.47/issa/reports/balkan/oct3192.htm ) , and respected the arms embargo . 
  during that period , you guys were ** part of the problem ** in the european neighborhood . 
   you guys have had ( and still have ) your share in fucking up the middle east . 
  while you may have a point there , i would say that we take the affairs of our own near-abroad somewhat seriously ( as do the russians and the chinese ) . 
  europe , for some weird reason does n't ( our allies are either lazy , or cowards ) . 
  so this complete inaction when it comes to attempting to resolve the conflict in your own neighborhood , has turned out to be expensive and annoying . 
  stop it . 
  this is unfortunately what you get when you ** do n't man the fuck up and go deal with isis in your local european neighborhood ** ~ ~ allow bleeding hearts like merkel and corporate interests ~ ~ ** and instead allow events in , libya , syria and iraq ** to decide the fate of an entire continent . 
  ** ftfy ** you guys are seriously just an entire continent who seems to have left their cojones back in srebrenica 25 years ago . 
   facts do not seem to support this , look at france . 
   well , in france , the main problem is basically that they do n't really do much about discrimination in the school or the labor markets . 
  but then those same guys come over here , or move to canada , and they are working good jobs becoming ` murican in about 3 years flat . 
  the problem with france ... . is the french . 
  the us ( and even canada ) have got a much better handle on this situation , i must say . 
  also , while the french muslim community comes from mostly from north africa , our 's is from saudi . 
  one of those places is more salafist than the other . 
  but we still manage . 
  and the french still fail . 
   we should just build better borders inside and around europe yeah ... then you guys are eventually gon na have to learn to stop failing so badly at managing the european neighborhood . 
  if you guys did n't learn from milosevic , for ghadaffi , or from isis ... . 
  when ** will ** you learn ? 
  see ... this is why nato recommends that you guys should spend 2.0 % of gdp on defense , instead of 0.8 % . 
  because that way you guys can handle you neighborhood without constantly having to call washington . 
  also , a little intra-eu coordination on this issue would be useful . 
  it might also be somewhat useful to build a reputation for going and taking care of business when it needs to get taken care of . 
   you said you wanted another dayton accords , but with which parties would you want to sign such a treaty ? 
   not that i 'm an expert , but i propose bringing all the warring parties ( except isis ) . 
  then i propose bringing in all the interested neighbors , so turkey , iran , saudi . 
   also what do you suggest we do on russian support for assad ? 
  see , that 's why europe needed to have acted sooner . 
  now , i guess that the russians will have to be invited to the table , and that the alawites will get to keep the regime ( for now ) . 
  and the regime will get to control more territory than they otherwise would have . 
  the result will be smaller countries , who will then be given a framework along which to work with eachother bilaterally , like in the balkans . 
  seeing as how mena is part of the european neighborhood , my main question is what sorts of preparatory measures are the eu nations undertaking . 
  or is this just more of an `` ignore the problem and hope it goes away '' type thing ? 
  it is n't the whole of the european neighborhood which is currently burning . 
  only some small specific parts of it . 
  no , i 'd rather we copy-pasted the solution that we applied to the balkans , which was more complex than just sending in peace keepers . 
  imo , a dayton accords 2.0 would be a major step towards putting a stop to the situation , such as it currently is . 
  then a war crimes tribunal should be organized in the hague ( assad should get indicted there ) , while the region gets at least some rebuilding funds . 
  then , parties who tried what milosevic tried ( to violate the peace agreements ) should be dealt with militarily . 
  i went to serbia last year , and i got the impression that life today seems pretty normal there . 
  so basically , telling milosevic to stfu was a good idea . 
  my point is that it 's a lesson that europe should remember every time things start going wrong in the european neighborhood . 
   croatia is an amazing country to live in i 'm guessing that it was n't exactly that way during the 1990s . 
  which is more or less my point . 
  you need to be enormously optimistic to think anyone or anything will stabilize ~ ~ mena ~ ~ ** the balkans ** anytime soon . 
  that 's the way the media told it back when i was a kid watching it all unfold on tv . 
  the bosnians and the croats stopped coming ( in huge numbers anyways ) . 
  all it took was for us to go tell milosevic to stfu . 
  how is this any different ? 
   yeah , we tried imperialism . 
  did n't work out . 
  actually , what i 'm talking about is n't really so much imperialism . 
  instead you can think of it as `` stop failing at neighborhood policy '' . 
  the russians and chinese take their neighborhood policy seriously . 
  so do we . 
  so , why do n't you ? 
   unlike yugoslavia , syria is in part a proxy war , and the worst party is purely a result of us foreign policy . 
  these are n't comparable situations at all . 
  the lack of action in the yugoslavia war was a disgrace , but in the middle east it 's the actors who should be ashamed , one and all . 
  i 'll admit that you make a pretty good point there , but that does n't really detract from the fact that inaction in its near-abroad , then as now , has it consequences . 
  that is true for all powers that ever were . 
  russia and china take this point very seriously in the 21st century . 
  not sure why europe can not be bothered . 
  mentioning that the us , russia , saudi , and iran have their footprints on this specific shitshow does n't really change that . 
   so as long as it 's not in your neighborhood you 're free to drop those considerations ? 
  can you name even two major strategic powers throughout history who have done that differently ? 
  do n't worry , i 'll wait . 
  for the rest ... you can sit there making ` murica jokes all day long if you want . 
  but the simple fact is still that you europeans will need to learn to take your own neighborhood more seriously . 
  we do . 
  and so do the russians & the chinese . 
  if you guys did not learn that lesson last time around from milosevic , you can learn it this time around from isis . 
  or next time around , from putin , or whoever else comes next . 
  until then , enjoy your waves upon waves of refugees . 
  you can call it what you want i suppose , i am not the unhcr , and i am not going to argue that point with you . 
  my point was that the simple fact is that wars create refugees . 
  and this specific war has managed to create lots of them . 
  so many that europe 's hard-power capacity to do anything about it has been overwhelmed . 
  but milosevic did the same . 
  you guys should have thought about that when you were being lazy about taking your neighborhood more seriously . 
  europe 's laziness is not without its consequences . 
  you europeans will eventually have to grow up and accept this reality . 
  i 'm not saying that you have to learn that lesson specifically from isis . 
  you could have learned it from milosevic . 
  or you can wait until next year when you will be learning it from putin . 
  but eventually , you will have to learn to get off your lazy european asses and take affairs in your neighborhood more seriously .
