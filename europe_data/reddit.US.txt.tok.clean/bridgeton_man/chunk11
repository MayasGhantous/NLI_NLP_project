   it is completely different , socio-economically , culturally , and factoring in global economic inequality . 
  comparing large droves of migrants coming from africa , the middle east and south east asia to yugoslavians or displacement that happened between 1939 and 1946 is naive . 
  ah ... you mean the old *** but they are brown *** . 
  i 've heard that before . 
  indeed , that makes the entire legal situation quite different . 
  that 's what they said during other times about protestants after all . 
  jews as well . 
  but it is worth mentioning that the droves are smaller this time around ( 2 million as opposed to 6 million ) , and the bad guys ( isis ) are a lot less organized and scary this time around too . 
  i guess someday , people will figure out that the law is meant to apply to everybody . 
   i agree that european defense budgets are shameful , and you 're right in pointing that out . 
  for the incentive : in afghanistan you failed . 
  in iraq , you failed . 
  you failed in libya , and you blocked an agreement with the russians for syria in 2011 . 
  none of those places are in our neighborhood . 
  our neighborhood is central america , haiti , cuba , mexico , etc. 
  and handling it in such a way as not to generate hundreds of thousands of refugees has been a specific us foreign policy objective since the 1820s . 
  that 's why we have accords with the cubans , and why we intervened in the haitian coup during the 1990s before it turned into a civil war , and why we intervened in the mexican civil war the moment it spilled into us territory . 
  as for libya , you can not blame us if you guys are too lazy to go in there and handle the situation according to your national interests . 
  you should have gone in there on day 1 . with a plan . 
  and you did n't . 
  not our fault . 
  same for syria , tunisia , bosnia , kosovo , ukraine , and georgia . 
   the refugee convention and that part of the geneva convention were designed in a post-ww2 context . 
  they are entirely inept as frameworks for regulating what 's happening now why ? 
  the situation is n't really that different , except that the scale is smaller . 
  the law builds in a clear incentive to deal with players like isis , or milosevic before they get large and out of control like the germans did . 
  that is still highly relevant , whether our free-riding european allies want to admit that or not . 
  it is n't so much that the allowed 1.2-2 million asylum seekers . 
  it 's more that the european allies just do not have the combined military and security forces to prevent 1.2 million people who really really want to get away from isis from doing so . 
  they should have thought about that when they were busy doing nothing whatsoever about the situation on the ground . 
  the same was true with milosevic last time around . 
  and it will be true with putin the next time around . 
  when will you guys learn ? 
   and what policy about syria would have worked ? 
  i propose copy-pasting the solution that was implimented in the balkans after we all decided to stop ignoring the things going wrong in that part of the world , and to take milosevic seriously . 
   do you have any clue about what you 're talking here or did you just pick up this line from a t-shirt somewhere ? 
  hungary is the single eu country which is costing the eu the most money ( so ... more than greece basically ) . 
  official figures on that actually surface in this very sub about a month ago . 
   how is the us not getting anything out of basically , what we need are allies who are prepared to help us with the primary 21st century strategic issues ( russia , china , the asia-pacific region ) . 
  ** what we do not need ** are a bunch of whiny free riders who do not contribute to the strategic well-being of the alliance , but still somehow manage to provoke the russians and the turks . 
  in 2008 , georgia got what was coming to it . 
  were they really serious in thinking that they could open fire on the russians , and they prey that we would come riding to the rescue before russia totally ruined their shit ? 
  while i agree with your point , i 'd like to point out that the the us-mexico net migration figures have been zero since about 2010 , and that most of the movement on that border has to do with central americans rather than mexicans . 
  i 'd also point out that this kind of logic is what 's behind our current agreements with cuba , as well as our clinton-era intervention in haiti . 
   merkel 's policy was a mistake , we indicated it the policy of doing nothing about syria until 900k refugees start leaving was one that pretty much every eu nation was pretty much on board with . 
  it 's the same thing that you guys did with libya , bosnia , ukraine and kosovo . 
  but i guess someday you guys will figure out that you need to handle the issues in your neighborhood before thousands of refguees start moving . 
   easterners are considered as second class europeans . 
  the main thing you guys do is cost the eu money . 
  also , defending you guys from putin is costing us money . 
  in exchange , we are getting nothing whatsoever out of it . 
  so , at the present moment , it is pretty much true that the east is a parasitic , second class region . 
  well ... this was more of a `` second-hand-defective product-for sale '' type offer . 
  dear putin , special xmas offer . 
  poland for $ 49.95, 
   it 's robbing ee of the brains required to bring them into the 1st world and straining our social systems . 
   does this refer to the `` schrodinger 's immigrant '' theory , whereby a migrant eats up your unemployment benefits while simultaneously stealing your job ? 
  why are we allies with countries who behave like this ? 
   keeping strong keeping strong ? 
  how ? 
  what does this mean exactly ? 
  what does this entail ? 
  yeah , but did n't you guys also supply the israelis with weapons ? 
  for ex . 
  their first front-line fighter plane , and also semtex ? 
   oh the russian near abroad would just love to be ignored . 
  yeah , but that does n't look very much like putin 's intentions . 
   seriously there is this thing called sovereignty yeah , i 've followed with interest the meaning of `` ukrainian sovereignty '' and georgian sovereignty '' over the past few years . 
  it really seems to be working our for them, 
   please just shut up you paranoid dumbass . 
  russia has absolutely no interests in invading the baltics . 
   did you just say * with a straight face * ... that the russians have no interest in invading a geographically strategic country which has a russian-speaking ethnic minority ? 
  is that why the baltic countries are asking us to put our military there ? 
  is that why baltic militaries are training for hybrid-warfare response ? 
  because they are not worried about russian aggression ? 
  is n't that what the ukrainians , georgians , and moldavians thought too ? 
  how did that turn out ? 
  but , but ... free-riding on neighbors and allies is a time-honored european tradition, 
  i 'd say right around the time when you guys started free-riding the alliance instead of dealing with and preventing problems in your near-abroad . 
  you 'd never see the russians ignoring their near-abroad . 
     so your solution is bomb more people ? 
    dropping bombs = / = preventing conflicts . 
   so yes , your solution is to drop more bombs . 
  there 's nothing further to say on this point . 
  are you actually this illiterate , or are you just trolling ? 
  you keep asking me if i think the bombing is a good idea . 
  i keep telling you that it is n't maybe if you ask me 150 more times , and i tell you `` dropping bombs = / = preventing conflicts '' ... would it get through then ? 
   who should put boots on the grounds to make sure its the right people that get to power then ? 
  wow . 
  i see that this did n't get through either . 
  okay , i 'll say it directly . 
  you guys should . 
  why ? 
  because that 's the best way to prevent hundreds of thousands of refugees showing up is for there not to be a convict that they 're fleeing from in the first place . 
  probably the only reliable way . 
   so your solution is bomb more people ? 
  i think you might have missed [ this part ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wytwm/young_people_vote_farright_in_europe/cy0ydvd ) , where i told you : * dropping bombs = / = preventing conflicts . 
  look dude . 
  you can complain , you can whine , you can retardedly miss the point , and you can call me names because you did , but that wo n't change the simple truth : wars create refugees . 
  i see that this is more difficult for some to understand than i imagined .
