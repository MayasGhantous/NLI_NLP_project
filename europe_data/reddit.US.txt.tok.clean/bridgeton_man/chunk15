  it 's because from time to time , shit like this keeps going down , and due to lack of resources , you do almost nothing about it . 
   except the eu will not be sending them back normally , you need a military and some logistical resources to do that . 
  let 's be honest , you dudes have no such resources . 
  well ... 
  i was hooping for more detail than that . 
  what 's the difference between east and south ? 
  what does the east-west wealth gap mean for the ecb and for monetary policy in the eurozone ? . 
  does n't the east only have like 3 countries which use the euro ? 
  will there be more ? 
  should there be more ? 
  yes , that will do . 
   also , naturally , it is only fair to assume donald trump , tea party , the creationists , racial discrimination are all representative for the whole of us . 
  on one hand , you make a good point . 
  on the other , we 've never has a member of cabinet that stupid ( not during my lifetime anyways ) . 
  this provides a view of just exactly how pathetic hungary really is . 
  lol, 
  you might wan na ask about what exactly the demographic of reddit users is . 
  that might provide some insight, 
   i would n't flee if we get invaded , this is my home . 
  not sure if all dutch citizens adopted that tone the last time germany invaded you guys . 
  care to elaborate in detail ? 
  but was n't the balkans divided btw the east and west roman empires during the reign of constantine , in the 3rd century ad ? 
  when was balkans ever not divided ? 
   the issue is not capacity , there 's enough of that . 
  the issue is the will to use it . 
  well , that is what politicians and policymakers say . 
  but then when the rubber hits the road , it turns out that this view is generally based on wishful thinking . 
  i spent last summer near the french italian border , and i witnessed how - the italian navy `` was prepared '' for the flow of refugees . 
  a month later they had to admit that they were completely overwhelmed . 
  not surprising really , given that the italian route saw ** almost 4 times ** as many refugees as it took to overwhelm the us coast guard in the florida straits in 1994 . 
  - the french told the italians that they `` were prepared to close the border '' in lieu of cooperating with italy . 
  these preparations came down to a small number of gendarmes at main border crossing , and even fewer gendarmes at the first railway station after the border . 
  and a single k-9 unit at the nice railway station . 
  ( but nothing on the maritime and rural mountain borders ) . 
  does that sound as if it were sufficient to handle 150k refugees you ? 
  either way , the french president ended up admitting that the best option was to actually coordinate with italy , since the french were not getting anywhere on their own . 
  and earlier this year , it turns out that it only took 100 refugees to completely outwit and embarrass the franco-italian border cooperation . 
  so , what i 've seen 1st hand about this , is that a lot of the `` capacity '' is mostly politicians talking tough , and acting as if 8 vessels operating in international waters without any 3rd county cooperation ( except turkish cooperation ) , is going to achieve something . 
  i was n't arguing that turket was n't one of them . 
  i was arguing that the whole reason the eu is having to come to turkey for help is because ** the eu ** generally has this problem . 
  it would probably be better for the eu if they developed the sort of capacity to handle the situation on their own . 
  even if that costs money . 
  um ... dual citizenship is a thing . 
  but what does that have to do with the free-ridership of european nato ? 
  tbh , while i understand this pov , it does seem to refer specifically to the way that things were before 2015 . 
  in realpolik terms , it looks like the turks are in a position to carrot & stick the eu w/r/t the refugee issue . 
  and the turkey-eu deal is basically a concession based on this fact . 
   never mind , i thought you were serious at first . 
  should i understand that your pov is that there are not voices advocating reneging on the eu-turkey deal . 
  at least as far as the visa waiver is concerned . 
  or , is your pov that there are not official numbers indicating that only 4 nato member nations actually live up to the 2 % defense expenditure standard . 
   they 're american and dutch and french whenever it suits their argument . 
  or ... maybe i 'm an american working in france who used to live in the netherlands . 
  maybe the fact that i now live in europe does n't necearily mean that i do n't still have an american pov when it comes to geopolitics , even if i have got a more european pov wwhen it comes to economic policy . 
  and maybe . 
  just maybe , we live in the modern 21st century , in which people move from one country to the next on a regular basis for professional reasons . 
  because capitalism . 
  wow ... a whole 8 ships . 
  i 'm impressed . 
  in 1994 , the us coat guard got overwhelmed by 44,000 cuban refugees in the florida straits . 
  just for reference , that 's about 1/23rd as many refugees as entered the eu in 2015 . 
  i 'm seriously making the point that the european allies have got insufficient security forces of all kinds to deal with this issue . 
  basically , you guys are seeing the consequences of having neglected security contributions to the alliance . 
  and it wo n't end here . 
  the next chapter in the saga is called `` ukraine '' . 
  and the one after that is called `` the baltic theater '' . 
  you ca n't free-ride forever . 
  if the greek crisis has taught us anything , it would be that germany tends to see the rest of the eu as a bunch of free-riders , in the same way that we see the european allies as a whole but on top of that , the discovery 's youtube channels characterize the german security forces are woefully underfunded and obsolete . 
  and , as for the french , i 'm not sure that they 'd be able to patrol the entire med on their won . 
  as for eu coordination , 2015 also demonstrated that northern europe keeps trying to say `` this is the euro-med 's problem . 
  not ours '', 
   we 're you under the impression we do n't have one ? 
   the italians were pretty explicit about this point in 2015 . 
  their navy is n't large enough to deal with the scale of the refugee issue . 
  and the greek one is ever more insufficient than that . 
  furthermore , all of the tough-talking countries on this issue ( like hungary and slovakia ) , have no navy whatsoever . 
  edit : okay , belgium is also one of the `` tough talking '' countries ( greece accused them of such ) . 
  and the belgian navy has fewer than 20 ships in it . 
  but that is still more than `` no ships whatsoever '', 
   we do not want visa-free travel for the turks , because ... yeah , but you do want turkish cooperation with the refuge issue . 
  europe 's problem , is that you guys are a bunch of free-riding welfare queens , who always want something-for-nothing . 
  which is exactly the same as our defense-cooperation relationship . 
  only 4 countries in nato pay their fair-share . 
  and one of those four is ` murica . 
   those security policies are a must if you want visa-free travel to the eu . 
  not really . 
  it would be sufficient if we reciprocate visa-free travel for eu citizens , and the trade cooperation that currently exists ( we are the world 's # 1 econ , after all ) . 
  that ... actually requires having a navy does n't it ? 
  on top of that , the eu actually needs bilaterally relations with 3rd countries . 
  and that wo n't be cheap . 
  the eu-deal with turkey is already showing cracks , mostly because the eu does n't have the resources to participate on their end og the arrangement and because the eu is reneging on it 's visa waiver part of the deal . 
  essentially , much like the us-europe relationship , the turks are calling-out the europeans for attempting to free-ride . 
  so , i have a hard time seeing how the europeans will actually manage to make this work . 
  in the long-run , people just do not like free-ridership . 
   first name me one effective fsa group that has not pledged allegiance to al qaeda ? 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  i see a lot of unsubstantiated bs about the fsa here . 
  but the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_syrian_army#2013_.e2.80.93_outstripped_by_al-nusra ) would indicate that they are n't talking . 
  i do think it 's funny that every time i say [ citation needed ] you just start making shit up instead of naming a source . 
  is this how you guys run your foreign policy ?
