  by making shit up ? 
   secondly , there are no refugees in the netherlands . 
  they are economic migrants , they have crossed numerous safe countries . 
  only < 15k have arrived thus far and they are not welcome . 
  this is not germany . 
  i 'm not the unhcr , and i 'm not here to argue which syrians are * actual * refugees , and which ones are actually coming for economic purposes . 
  for the purposes of this discussion , it is n't that relevant . 
  although , i guess maybe , if they were coming for free stuff , instead of running away from decapitation-happy terrorists , then it might be easier to convince them not to come over . 
  maybe . 
  but ... that 's not my point . 
  my point is that with a 14-boat carboard navy , and a 5-year long backlog of deporations , and zero troops in the warzone these refugees are fleeing from , you guys are n't going to achive shit . 
  especially not with a defense budget of $ 14.50 . 
  so who is running from isis and who is running from assad is actually meaningless next to the fact that either way , you do n't have the resources to do fuck all about it . 
  you guys could have dealt with the syria issue when it was small and inexpensive . 
  but you decided to wait until it got so large that even the us coast guard would be overwhelmed . 
  14 dutch sailors on a surf-board are going to achieve shit . 
   you are delusional , says the guy who quotes conspiracy-grade press and provides no sources whatsoever . 
   syria is not my backyard , it is n't ? 
  by this do you mean that shit happening there ** does not ** cause direct consequences in the netherlands ? 
  so ... you were actually complaining about imaginary refugees then ? 
  and that , brussels , paris , and nice got attacked recently by an imaginary syrian faction ? 
   fsa is a myth . 
  [ citation needed ]  cant wait for the petrodollar to collapse . 
  you have have dropped your tinfoil hat while reading [ this secretsofthefed.com article . 
  ] ( http://www.secretsofthefed.com/end-of-petrodollar-first-middle-eastern-oil-power-to-open-chinese-currency-hub/ ), 
   in mali a small al qaeda insurgency was attacked , ultimately unsuccessful because those fuckers are still there . 
  would you agree that there is a material difference between a terrorist faction so puny that the malians can handle them , and a terrorist faction so large and well organized that it can control territory and attack its enemies overseas as if it were *** a state *** ? 
   in syria you actually support al qaeda . 
  [ citation needed ]  you want to bomb assad and help the rebels , which are jihadist terrorists that want to exterminate minorities , or do you want to bomb both , or first the one and then the other . 
  yeah , i 've heard that conspiracy theory too . 
  i think i read it at secretsofthefed.com or something . 
  in reality though , we are n't friends with nusra . 
  we are friends with fsa . 
  to whom nusra is selectively hostile , then friendly , then hostile again . 
   it gets confusing when all you have is bombs . 
  if it were our own backyard , we would take a more hands-on approach . 
  but it is n't . 
  so we have better things to worry about . 
  like china . 
  it is your backyard though . 
  so , it might be prudent if you guys gave at least as much of a damn about it as you did about the balkans . 
  unless you enjoy having your cardboard navy overrun by refugees , that is . 
   we dont need your protection , there wont be a war with russia check with our other allies on that . 
  check with georgia , estonia , lithuania , latvia . 
  then check with ukraine . 
  i mean technically you are correct . 
  ukraine is not [ technically ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lu8wmgo ) at war with russia . 
  the ukrainians are actually fighting '' ** ukrainian separatists ** '' ^ ^ tm [ visit russia before russia visits you . 
  ] ( http://cdn.webfail.com/upl/img/f30923429db/post2.jpg ), 
   if western powers would invade in syria you would get a hell of a lot more than 2 million refugees . 
  okay . 
  then riddle me this . 
  * * where are the 2 million * *** malian *** * refugees subsequent to operation serval ? 
  * * * was milsevic creating more refugees or fewer refugees after we told him to stfu ? 
  *  the entire alawite community , and what remains of the christians would go or be exterminated by islamist butchers . 
  the entire croat community , and what remains of the bosnians would go or be exterminated by serb butchers . 
  and then you either hand over the balkans to the serbs/bosnians/kosovars / croats , or you go on and fight an insurgency for the next decade . 
  see what i did there ? 
  when i was a kid , nobody ever believed that the balkans would ever be pacified , given that there 's been continuous war over there non-stop since classical antiquity . 
  [ until we bombed them back into the stone age , that is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia ) . 
   usa and friends would stop supporting jihadist terrorists in syria well ... 
  i 'm not saying that we do n't do questionable things in the world . 
  i 'm just saying that we take our backyard serious . 
  so do the russians . 
  so should you guys . 
   no need to take advice from a nation that is number one in only 2 things : defence budget and prison population . 
  our defense budget is large because we defend a lot of allies who free-ride . 
  if every nato country lived up to the 2 % of gdp obligation , then we would not need to have a military budget of 3.5 % of gdp . 
  so in other words , you guys are costing us money . 
  i know that trump has said that . 
  but so has obama . 
  so did bush . 
   no we dont want to invade syria and make things worse okay . 
  enjoy your 2 million refugees then . 
   just like the usa has done in iraq i find it interesting that there are exactly zero malian refugees . 
  and that aqim has managed only one small-scale attack since the french decided that the al-qaeda caliphate [ ** shall not exist ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval ) . 
  in a similar way , nato at some point decided that [ ** milosevic should learn to stfu ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_intervention_in_bosnia_and_herzegovina ) . 
  eventually , order got restored in the balkans . 
  croatian and serbain refugees are no longer a thing . 
  right ? 
  okay . 
  then please tell me exactly why your so-called right-wing is too pussy and too effiminate to actually deal with the european near-abroad where it lives ? 
  i realize that srebrenica might be a bad memory for you dude , but did you really have to leave your balls behind in yugoslavia like that ? 
  how is it possible that you do n't like the refugees isis sends , but you do nothing about isis ? 
  how is it possible that rutte complains about putin shooting down a commercial airliner over ukraine , but then does nothing about russians in the ukraine ? 
  okay ... i get that the european right ** can complain ** . 
  but why all the effeminate unmanly inaction ? 
   the refugees need to be deported , capacity is not the problem if your defense budget is 1 % of your gdp , and your country only has 16 million to start with . 
  and you have no troops in syria or in libya , which has only resulted in the number of refugees on the move in one year is ** 23 times as large as what 's required to overwhelm the us coast guard ** ... . it 's more than definitely an issue of capacity . 
  i get that wishful thinking is a thing . 
  but personally , i do n't believe in magic . 
   then resources ** should ** be made available lol . 
  only 4 nato members actually contribute 2 % of gdp or more towards defense . 
  we are one of them . 
  the rest are free-riders and welfare queens . 
   not getting involved in syria is a great idea , lol again . 
  dealing with flare-ups and trouble-spots in the near-abroad is the first thing that any relevant country in the world does . 
  that way they do n't have to deal with consequences of foreign crises on their own shores . 
  that 's why ** we ** have agreements with cuba & mexico , and troops in haiti . 
  and why the russians give a shit about what goes on in their immediate neighborhood .
