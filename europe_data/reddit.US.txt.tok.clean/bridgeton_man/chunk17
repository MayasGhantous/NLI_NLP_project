  the 1994 cuban refugee crisis demonstrated that it only takes around 45,000 refugees to overwhelm our coast guard . 
  so , now , we deal with cuba directly on this issue ( and we normally would never ever talk to them , ( until last year ) , but this issue is somewhat special ) . 
  i have no idea how your european 14-boat navies will manage ** 23 times that many people ** . 
  which is why you need to deal with the source directly . 
  as far as europe is concerned , you guys literally had the choice between sending enough troops to do in syria what france did in mali and what nato did in yugoslavia , or watching your navies , coast guards , and border patrols get overwhelmed by people fleeing from isis and assad ( and let 's face it , al-baghdadi is way scarier than any sort of eu security forces ) . 
  you had the choice . 
  now you have to deal with the consequences of that choice . 
  no matter how much effeminate european whining happens about it . 
   you can help 10 refugees in the region for the cost of relocating one ` refugee ' to the west . 
  you should have thought about that while you guys were all so busy voting not to help , not to get involved in the war in syria , not to maintain a maritime presence in the med . 
  instead , the eu response to bad things happening in the european neighborhood was basically [ ** this ** ] ( http://wonderopolis.org/wp-content/uploads//2015/03/1425_3.jpg ) . 
  and doing that has consequences . 
   they should be deported upon illegal arrival . 
  lol . 
  with what resources ? 
  last i checked , the netherlands already has a 5-year backlog in deportations ( and that 's without the recent arrivals ) . 
  the belgian navy has 14 ships in it , and the italian navy was completely overwhelmed by the number of refugees in 2015 ( and that 's despite the fact that the italian route only had 1/8th of all 2015 refugees into europe . 
  even when you guys asked for turkish support , it turned out that the eu could initially only send 10 % as many personnel to cooper with the turks as they 'd planed . 
  they eventually got it up to 25 % . 
  ** you dudes can talk tough , but you just do n't have the resources **, 
   i hate trump just as much as everyone else but being against nato free riding is pretty logical to me . 
  true enough . 
  both bush and obama have made statements to that effect . 
  but saying at the party convention `` we will not defend our allies '' is something else basically , it 's offering to give away our commanding advantage in terms of geostrategic position away to the russians . 
  and doing so for no other reason than because denmark , slovakia and luxembourg are n't paying their bills . 
  it just does n't sound clever . 
  meh ... i think the one in prague is prettier, 
  well , he did openly say that he is n't sure that he wants to defend the free-riding nato allies . 
  he 'd rather only defend the nato allies who actually contribute to the alliance rather than free-ride it . 
  and denmark is basically the free-rider in chief . 
  because while denmark is bad at contributing to the alliance , the are really good at provoking other countries ( and dealing with this costs the rest of the alliance money ) . 
  so trump 's idea is that if putin ( who is , after all , trump 's sexual boyfriend ) , decides to move against any of the free-riders , then the usa should be okay with it . 
  as a matter of scale , that scale is rather different than having our international sovereign completely overwhelmed because we ignored a small civil war war on our border . 
  during the mexican civil war , we actually sent troops in the moment that it started spilling over into our territory . 
  even the turks can manage that better than you . 
  not being able to make your trains run on time is one thing . 
  but failing to manage your own near-abroad is a much more serious symptom of national incompetence . 
   in case hillary should win , and the usa gets an increase in migrants , people could say the same thing about you . 
  lol . 
  we have troops in haiti , working relationships with cuba and mexico , and a history of direct intervention in damn near every country in the western hemisphere for a specific reason . 
  you guys do n't . 
  that 's the main difference . 
  in our neighborhood , when bad things happen , we do something . 
  and we are n't unique in that respect . 
  china , russia , iran , and even turkey can manage to figure this out . 
  meanwhile , european-nato is too busy free-riding the alliance to actually develop the necessary capabilities needed to handle your own damn neighborhood . 
  that 's the difference . 
  tbh , after having lived in both nl and in belgium , it seems to me that while everybody is really good at whining in the most effeminate matter , when it comes to the consequences of shit that goes down in the european neighborhood , nobody actually has the stomach to support sending troops anywhere to deal with things before they get to the 2-million refugees stage . 
  nobody wants to spend the necessary cash either . 
  and ... that 's why the eu has had to make a deal with turkey on this issue . 
  to be fair , i think that turkey is basically not a democracy , and their core national interests are substantially different and the eu when it comes to syria and iraq , but you got ta admit that they actually have a real military , that they are a major buyer of us arms , and that they actually have the balls to go get involved when bad shit starts happening in their immediate neighborhood ( with the caveat that they generally tend to back down if the russians get involved ) . 
  why ca n't european nato be like that ? 
  it 's not like they have n't got the cash to develop the military resources . 
  and it would add a lot of value to nato . 
  do you see what the french did in mali when there was a caliphate setting up shop there ? 
  why ca n't you guys do that ? 
  it depends on what sort of resources are available to deal with this issue . 
  knowing our free-rider allies ... it 's likely that the amount of hard-power resources are completely insufficient to achieve anything other than the most meaningless symbolic gestures . 
  those are things that you guys should have been thinking about when you were deciding to free-ride nato ( at our expense ) , when you took the decision to ignore syria , libya , ukraine , ect . 
  not 3 or 4 years later when the problem got so big that this tiny excuse for a military that most european nato field gets completely overwhelmed by the groups of people so large that you can not hope to do anything about . 
  and who are more afraid of decapitation-happy bad guys than they will ever be of the dutch navy . 
  i swear , it seems like you guys left your cojones at srebrenica . 
  as a nation . 
  so ... enjoy the consequences of your decision to chose inaction and free-riding instead of decisive action . 
   sadly some people want to believe in the lie that all the people streaming into europe are all very well meaning , while i doubt that anybody believes in any of this well-meaning bs , there are some hard facts that you dudes need to face up to . 
  1 . wars create refugees . 
  2 . the dutch are so busy free-riding the nato alliance that they 've done exactly nothing to manage the situation in the european neighborhood . 
  last time i checked , there are exactly zero dutch troops in syria right now . 
  i 'm not sure how many dutch naval vessels are in the med , but i 'd be surprised if the figure were larger than 2 . and one of them is probably a rusted canoe with a malfunctioning motor . 
  i recently read a report saying that nl does n't actually have the capacity to do anything about the scale of the people coming . 
  as it is , nl has a 5-year backlog in deportations . 
  ** nl just does n't have sufficient resources ** to deal with this . 
  you guys shoulda thought about that when you were busy deciding not to get involved with syria . 
  4 . in 2015 , 1.01 million refugees entered the eu . 
  if you guys did ' t have the resources to handle pre-syrian-war levels of migration , you guys ( the entire eu 's hard-power resources ) definitely do not have sufficient resources to do anything now . 
   wait , italy has never heard of freedom of speech ? 
  apparently not . 
  did you guys ever even have any equivalent to de-nazification after the war ? 
   we even used to have communists and neo fascists . 
  yeah apparently you even sent mussolini 's daughter to represent your country in the european parliament . 
   we want freedom ** but ... ** ah yes , the mating call of the totalitarian . 
  * * all animals are equal . 
  * *** but *** * some are more equal than others . 
   that would be a good thing and i say that as a left winger yes , but you 're probably also saying it as a guy from a country which has never even heard of the freedom of speech , and yet somehow manages to be free-riding our military alliance . 
  pretty fucked up when you consider that the whole point of our alliance is us willing to stand by whoever loves freedom . 
  even if it costs lots of money . 
  ( kennedy 's words , not mine ) . 
  tbh , it would be hillarous if he did win . 
  and besides , do n't cats actually do quite well for themselves in hell ? 
  i read a empirical german working paper recently , that found that the gender pay gay is statistically negligible for lesbians , but that homosexual men do see a pay gap comparable to the gender pay gap . 
  i propose therefore that we mitigate this by having the eu dictate that all women everywhere in the eu develop the publicly-displayed , uncontrollable urge to lez-it-out !, 
  that might work !, 
  ( and even if it did n't , it 'd still be pretty enjoyable as public spectacle ), 
   even the best-made burger is only gastronomic barbarism . 
  better a well-made burger than gulash with cabbage in it . 
   you are only supposed to have the right kind of freedom `` all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others . '', 
  war is peace , freedom is slavery , ignorance is strength, 
  so france 's approach is not to have freedom ? 
  damn dude . 
  that 's just sad .
