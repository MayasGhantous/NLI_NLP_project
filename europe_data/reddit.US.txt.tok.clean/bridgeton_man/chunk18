  `` war is peace , freedom is slavery , ignorance is strength '', 
  just because our puritanical protestant past still haunts us , does n't mean that i agree with that sort of shameless statism . 
  also , ** do n't you ever diss a well-made burger ** . 
  at least not until whatever eu country you 're from learns to make a decent one . 
  a better translation might be : ** the state shall have control of how you dress ** . 
  i realize that you 're from the part of europe liberated by stalin instead of the part liberated by us . 
  and that you putin-fellating joke of a president is really into what he calls `` illiberal democracy '' ... 
  but ** freedom ** still has meaning for some people out there . 
  i too , demand that the state control how citizens are to dress . 
  but only if they are women . 
  and only if those women are at least mildly-hot . 
  more statism is definitely the solution . 
  would n't you agree ? 
  when did ** state control ** ever fail us ? 
  `` in the name of freedom of speech & expression , i hereby dictate that ** the state ** shall decide about how women are to dress '' - * france *, 
  you can pretend as if trump is the only one saying that . 
  but it also means you 'd have to pretend that you 've never heard president obama , or any dc think tanks say it . 
   also , we went into mali because a ) a direct threat to our ally b ) vital interests were in play c ) a legal obligation due to a treaty we signed with mali . 
  it made perfect sense to go . 
  and , i applaud that . 
  all i 'm saying is that ** europe as a whole ** needs to be able to follow suit . 
  and on a regular basis . 
  not just in mali . 
  also in libya , ukraine , the baltic coast , and the balkans . 
   what the hell does that even mean ? 
  it means - send sufficient forces to tell people like ghadaffi and milosevic to stfu , when they get uppity . 
  - send peace-keepers when states collapse or civil wars break out in your immediate neighborhood . 
  what was eventially done in the balkans is what needed to have been done in tunisia & libya . 
  i 'm not saying that croatia , slovenia , and serbia are heaven on earth today . 
  but i am saying that the situation looks sufficiently stable there , and should serve as an example of what to do . 
   stop talking out of your ass . 
  stop free-riding the alliance . 
  if you guys would pay your fair share , then you 'd have the necessary resources to put troops in the parts of the european near-abroad which are unstable before shit like libya ad syria happen . 
  yes , i 'm fully ware that france sent troops to mali to shut al-queda 's caliphate down , thus nipping that civil war in the bud . 
  what i 'm saying is that if you guys would not free-ride us so shamefully , then you 'd have the resources to do shit like that ** every time ** . 
  but instead , you want to use the money to subsidize butter & wine production . 
  so , enjoy . 
   italy had immigration agreements with tunisia and libya . 
  would that be the with the ** previous ** regimes in those countries , or the current ones ? 
  that requires a suitably large navy . 
  and sending that navy into the national territorial waters of a foreign country requires explicit bilateral arrangements & treaties . 
  italy has neither of those two things . 
  in principle , the free-ride-y part of the nato alliance has neither the budget to have actually viable security forces , nor the foresight to develop relevant diplomatic relations . 
  guess they were just expecting uncle sam to do the heavy lifting . 
  every time . 
  but this time , we 've got better things to put our military efforts to . 
  so , we 're not able to lend a hand here . 
  at least not until you guys are prepared to help us out with some of the more serious geopolitical goings on in the world . 
  this is a key point that the guy in question ( and most of the stormfront-trolls ) seem to keep missing . 
   like i said , it sure as shit was n't the working classes . 
  sweden 's hundreds of thousands of middle easterners did n't just magically appear , they were permitted to stay there by someone . 
  i do n't agree . 
  it 's actually moreso the case that sweden , and every other eu country basically does n't have the force , budget or manpower to do anything about it . 
  to the european allies , i can only say that free-riding the alliance only takes you so far . 
  `` right , as the world goes , is only in question between equals in power , while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must . '', 
  -- this quotation is part of the melian dialogue, 
  while i 'm not sure what europe plans to do about him , what ** we ** need to do about him , is send beijing a formal letter that says : * dear people 's republic of china * * we 've decided that it is no longer in our interest to defend this country , nor its regime . 
  no matter what you guys do there , we will not ask questions . 
  have fun !, 
  * * sincerely , * * * ` murica *, 
   we need to pool our resources together and spend money efficiently to defend ourselves from outside unfluences - including the us . 
  ok . do that then . 
   so , will you also grant the europeans the same influence concerning nato strategy and decisions ? 
  commensurate with their actual contribution to the alliance , i would say . 
   i actually doubt the us establishment wants to give the eu equal say about it . 
  well , not if they are just gon na sell weapons to saddam , ghadaffi , and milosevic , while openly provoking putin without an actual plant to deal with him once he 's been provoked ... and then ask ** us ** to clean up the mess you 've made , even though it affect ** you ** directly ( but does n't affect us directly half the time ) . 
  military defense and security of the european neighborhood . 
   i 'd rather have it not getting done it 's easy to say that when we are doing it for you , at our expense . 
   i understand it 's not always easy to be responsible for the security in europe , but believe me , it is both yours and our best option . 
  we 'd like it if you guys paid and participated your fair share in this . 
  like japan and korea do . 
  it would also lead to our allies actually offering help instead of asking for it when it comes to the likes of isis , assad , milosevic , ghadaffi , and putin . 
  since we 're kinda busy with the south china sea right now , we could really use the help . 
  there 's no intrinsic reason why we need to save 400 million of the world 's richest and most capable from the likes of minor threats in their own damn neighborhoods . 
  the part that interested me the most was the part where he finally admits that `` the americans will not guarantee of the european neighborhood security in the future . 
  either we do it ourselves , or it will not get done '' . 
  finally ffs !, 
  somebody who proposes an end to the free-riding of our alliance . 
  which is what is needed , frankly . 
  that depends on who you ask . 
  but samuel huntington thought that anglos should think twice before letting us live in `` their '' territory . 
  also , let 's not forget that bigoted stereotypes do exist about us . 
   cuban emigr\u00e9s wanted to integrate in their new home back in the 60 's the feeling was more like `` we 'll stay a while , then then return to cuba when things calm down '', 
  cuban-american here , i can confirm that while we , today have higher education rates and median incomes than the us population at large , that definitely did not occur within the fist 18 months of our arrival . 
  it takes a bit longer than that . 
  but anyways , i guess optimism is all you have when you lack the resources or firepower to handle it any differently ( which is what this is really about ) . 
  the question is though ... how exactly do you and belgium manage to export so many more jihadis than pretty much anybody else out there ? 
  ** our ** local arabs do shit like joining isis only very rarely . 
  we have a bigger problem with armed rednecks , frankly . 
  ** how did you guys fuck this up worse than us , the germans , or the british ??!?!, 
  ** how ? 
   i wish we could rewind the past , and not get invaded by algeria , morocco , tunisia , and senegal . 
  see , most europeans say this . 
  but back in the day you guys really really really wanted to have colonial empire . 
  empires which were built with the support of all sorts of local colonial collaborators whose descendants you are now hosting . 
  gurkhas , harkis , afrikaaners , evoluees , indo-dutch , anglo-indians , foreign legionaires . 
  you liked having that glorious empire right ? 
  well ... here 's the long - term ramifications of it then . 
  enjoy !, 
   keeping them will fuck up the resources of your children a thousand times over .
