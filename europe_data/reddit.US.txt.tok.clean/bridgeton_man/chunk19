   yeah , but whining about it like a little bitch does not magically make the size of your country 's army , coast guard , and security force grow . 
  you pussies have got to stop free-riding our alliance and learn to handle your business . 
  and no insta-surrendering this time please . 
   there was never question of letting them stay temporarily and let them go back once the war is finished . 
  they might , and they might not . 
  depends on how quickly your country 's army can resolve the crisis over there . 
  lol . 
  expelling people generally requires resources . 
  you have to do stuff in regions where the crisis starts in the fist place , [ instead of doing this ] ( http://gerdleonhard.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c59be53ef013488b614d8970c-800wi ) everytime there is a crisis in the eu 's near abroad . 
  because once it gets to the point that 1 million people are coming per year , you obviously do n't have any resources to do anything about it whatsoever . 
  wow , i guess my 1st comment was not in before the stormfront spam brigade showed up to attempt to somehow change the subject to muslims . 
   obviously we ca n't judge every pakistani go fuck yourself . 
  in before the stormfront brigade shouts `` muslims ! '', 
   i do get it now . 
  these people are a problem for everyone . 
  i still think they would fare better in a muslim setting than in europe . 
   the mena counties might not see it that way . 
  lat-am certainly does not see it that way . 
   but we were talking about freshly minted immigrants lat-am governments would say that it is exactly the new arrivals which end up being the easiest recruitment targets for inner-city gangs , and so expresses no real surprise that a number of repatriation requests concern recent immigrants . 
   meanwhile , monocultural countries like switzerland have no problems . 
  huh ? 
  switzerland has four official languages , and the swiss themselves are a minority in switzerland , while everybody who actually works there is an expat . 
  is n't it ? 
   i 'm fairly confident dna analysis can help not really . 
  it can tell you what general area somebody 's ancestors came from . 
  but it can not help you pinpoint where that guy was born . 
  somebody having a `` middle-eastern '' haplogroup can be of jewish decent . 
  even if they 've lived in poland for 10 generations . 
  meanwhile , `` indo-european '' haplogroup can fail to differentiate an india from an afghan , from a russian . 
  and asking refugees nicely is n't going to work unless they want to be repatriated ( which is n't why they risked their lives to get that far ) . 
   the thing with 3 . 
  i just do n't get . 
  the countries involved do not have any incentive to accommodate any requests of this kind . 
  if i 'm a naval officer , and a foreign vessel attempted to my shore to leave people there without prior informed consent to my naval command , i 'd tell them that my country 's territorial waters are closed and to fuck off before we open fire ( nato art. 5 does not protect this either , so you wo n't be able to call us to help you out ) , i used to work at a foreign embassy in washington . 
  that country used to selectively refuse repatriation . 
  because muh sovereignty . 
  since it was a latin american country , i can say that the attitude on this in the lat-am caribbean region is that repatriations coming from the us prison system are ruining the security situation of countries like jamaica and dr , who would prefer to have their countries over-run with american tourists instead of american gang members . 
  they feel that the problem is america 's criminal inner-city culture , and they are against importing it . 
  since central american countries have imported it to such an extent , that american street gangs are over-running their country 's ability to do anything whatsoever . 
  so now the view in lat-am is that south bronx and south central la are american problems . 
  not lat-am ones . 
  i do n't know how the mena countries will see it , but given that the eu countries are exporting shitloads of terrorists to those countries , i 'd be surprised if the mena governments did n't adopt similar views as the lat-am countries . 
  which is to say that the view might exist that molenbeek is a ** belgian ** problem rather than a mena one . 
  yeah , but in order to do that the french would : 1 . 
  need to stop free-riding and develop the proper budget and resources for that . 
  no we wo n't help . 
  figure out which specific countries those would be . 
  find a way to convince the countries involved to accept repatriation . 
   im not european ok , but most of the sub is . 
  i fly the us flag , but i live in europe , and i keep seeing them fuck it up . 
  current crisis included . 
   id never have started bombing libya to begin with ok . 
  but how would that lead to results any different than not bombing assad ? 
  lol . 
  if you europeans had enough balls to go in and rectify the situation in libya , you would n't be dealing with this in the first place . 
  on the otherhand , if is 's presence there were to somehow be dealt with properly ... 
  it does fucking suck . 
  i fully agree : /, 
   more like `` noooo ! '', 
  in my case . 
  i miss my childhood when we had white christmas . 
  nowadays we 're lucky when it starts snowing in january and it 's usually gone so soon :( i was staying in norway last year from january till june and it felt so good to finally have a proper winter again . 
  when someone starts denying that climate warming is a thing , i get furious . 
   when i was a kid back in dc , i remember that fall and spring were marked by huge squadrons of [ canadian geese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canada_goose ) making their way to florida in the fall , and then back to canada in the spring . 
  they would stay in town for 2 weeks or so and just chill in every lake , pond , river and stream . 
  then they 'd fly off . 
  i used to enjoy watching them on the move . 
  now ... what we 've got instead , is a residential flock of geese ( and ducks whom they 've learned to accept ) , who actually winter in washington dc . 
  they occupy two or three remote spots on the banks of the potomac river . 
  future generations in washington will never know the joys of seeing fall symbolized by seeing [ ** this ** ] ( http://www.mybirdoftheday.ca/wp-content/uploads/canada-geese-on-migration-1024x768.jpg ) on a crisp fall morning while watching the leaves change color . 
  now-a-days , fall in dc just means rain . 
  :'(  we all know that without significantly increased activity in the regions which the migrants escape , they wo n't stop coming . 
  i see it this way too . 
  imo , it 's only a matter of time before we all decide to treat the situation the way we ended up treating yugoslavia . 
  right now , american and russian leaders are sitting around negotiating how we want the post-war situation to look like . 
  once that 's done , there 's probably going to be a bit of ** fuck yeah ** happening to isis , assad , and so on . 
  it looks like the main concern here is not having to constantly clear the tourist beached of dead bodies washing up . 
  when i lived in miami , this was a thing that used to happen in other spots on the fl coast sometimes . 
  especially with haitian refugees . 
  the crossing is pretty damned dangerous . 
  so , a lot of them did n't make it alive . 
  lol . 
  our guy is wearing a cowboy hat !, 
  funny how they keep calling these parties `` freedom party '' instead of `` party for the limitation of freedoms '' - * the ministry of peace concerns itself with war , the ministry of truth with lies , the ministry of love with torture , and the ministry of plenty with starvation . 
  these contradictions are not accidental , nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy : they are deliberate exercises in doublethink . 
  for it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely . 
  in no other way could the ancient cycle be broken . 
  * - *** george orwell ( 1984 ) ***, 
   seriously , are you sure you 're not exaggerating ? 
  i think i would have remembered that winter . 
  it never snows here non-stop every single day for six months . 
  actually it snowed about twice a week for most of that time . 
  back where i 'm from the snow is mostly gone 2 weeks after it falls . 
  but in prague , there was so damned much of it , that it took until april for it to disappear . 
   but anyway , global warming is kicking in and the winters are getting milder and milder . 
  : /  wow , this is really difficult to hear , i 'm sorry . 
  i do n't even know what to say , only that i think the attitudes towards people of different colours are getting better , specially prague is nowadays quite cosmopolitan . 
  i would imagine this to be the case , after ten more years of being part of the eu . 
   well in the end , there will be no functioning allocation system at all , precisely for the reason that neither the refugees nor the host countries are willing to respect it/implement it . 
  the way i see it , either the euopeans will figure something out , which all the eu countries are willing to accept , or the refugees will take to their own devices .
