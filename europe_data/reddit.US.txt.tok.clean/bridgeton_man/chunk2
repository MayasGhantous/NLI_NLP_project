  cuban-american here , if we are talking about eritreans being refugees , it 's worth noting that they legally evaluate this sort of thing based on how awful the situation is that people are actually fleeing from . 
  with that said , it 's worth mentioning that the dictatorship in eritrea is [ internationally ranked as severe and as unfree as north korea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index ) . 
  considering that we are both from a country who recognizes refugee status on that basis , and that we 've let in people from china , vietnam , ussr , belarus , poland , hungary , cuba , and 2 or 3 other countries who are somehow ** less fucked ** than eritrea in the dictatorship department , i 'm sure it probably makes sense that people flee that country at higher rates than they do from other neighboring countries who , while poor , are less fucked in the dictatorship department . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/06/12/the-brutal-dictatorship-the-world-keeps-ignoring/ ) is a wp article about the dictatorship there . 
  that 's the sort of reality that the comfortable europeans on the forum do n't seem to realize . 
  what 's hilarious about it is that a lot of the users on here are from countries like czech republic , poland , hungary , and slovakia . 
  countries who , while they have a legacy of being unfree , and who certainly sent refugees our way not so long ago , have totally forgotten anything about what that was like . 
  as for me , i live in a country where free speech is a thing . 
  how do they do it where you live comrade ? 
  yes , thank you . 
  that is an excellent point . 
  all i 'm saying , is that people on reddit tend to get mad whenever somebody proposes limiting free speech . 
  now ... whether that 's people being annoyed that the state prevents them from shouting `` let 's drown people in the med '' , or whether that 's people being annoyed by the state telling people what they can wear , is beside the point . 
  so . . it 's safe to say that you are n't one of those believers in free speech and freedom of expression that reddit is known for . 
  um ... cyprus actually needs resources to do those three things . 
  does n't it ? 
  much the same as is the case in europe , they have n't got any resources for any of those things . 
  similar things are true for a number of countries around the world . 
  but your country still finds it politically and strategically convenient to officially legitimize this fact . 
  right ? 
   the eu does n't let in members and then rescind their membership ^ ( ** right now ** ) , ** ftfy ** funny that . 
  i do seem to recall people making statements to that effect in the middle of the greek financial crisis . 
  because , geopolitical realities change you know . 
   too bad for you , that you are n't running the eu , mehmet lol dude . 
  not everybody who disagrees with you is turkish . 
  i 'm actually a washingtonian who 's based in brussels . 
  so ... um , enjoy the free tax money i keep having to send you . 
  but if you really want to call me after one of my country 's past leaders , call me `` eisenhower '' or `` truman '' . 
  how about that ? 
  and if it were up to me , we 'd take advocate hard line against [ ** anybody who climbed into bed with putin ** ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/26/bff-why-russia-and-cyprus-are-getting-cosy-again.html ) . 
   settled , and ruled are two different things mate . 
  the chinese are one ethnic people that 's not really that relevant . 
  [ or even ** true ** for that matter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taiwanese_people ) . 
  my argument is that the argument that `` the government on my side of the line is legitimate , therefore we can bring greeks if we want , but the government on the other side of the line is n't so by extension , neither is their decision to bring in turks '' is a floppy one because it does n't have anything holding it up except for the de jure status quo ( which , in and of itself does n't really benefit any external actor at this time ) . 
  de jure status quos can change with the interests of the times . 
  and right now , cyprus ' national interest is just not that relevant . 
  so ...  i 'm not worried that the eu will rescind recognition of my country and recognize the turkish occupation state . 
  i on the other hand would not lose much sleep if we would switch from recognizing your side of the line to recognizing the gov. 
  on the other side of the line . 
  for starters , your side is more cozy with putin than the other side is likely to be . 
  and that already counts for a lot . 
  even ** if ** the other side is equally just a much of an economically unproductive , money-costing , tax-haven as the gov your side of the line is . 
  so , my advice to the cypriots is that they should start trying harder to make themselves somewhat more relevant in the world , or at least within the eu , so that there 's actually a good strategic reason not to make any change in recognition . 
  not really . 
  my argument the whole time is that you can not hang an entire argument on the de jure reality , without any reincorcement whatsoever from any sort of de facto argument . 
  because de jure realities can change . 
  it 's really that simple . 
   the prc did not settle foreign occupied territory this is not what taipei would say . 
  according to taipei , all of china and all of taiwan are ruled by taipei . 
  according to beijing , all of china and all ot taiwan are ruled by beijing . 
  in the 1970s we decided for strategic reasons , that it was better to pretend as if beijing was correct . 
  basically taiwan 's usefulness as a strategic ally was eclipsed by china 's usefulness as a strategic partner , given the de facto geostrategic realities of the time . 
  it was nothing personal , and in basically as far as legitimacy goes , taiwan is pretty legit , imo . 
  it 's a potential strategic ally , which is also an industrialized capitalist market , and a democracy . 
  but washington cares about beijing for strategic reasons . 
   what your basically saying ... no . 
  what i 'm saying is that it can easily happen that the de jure reality can change overnight . 
  especially if it is n't being reinforced by anything of any significance in a de facto sense . 
  it 's just the way things are . 
   the republic of cyprus is a legally recognised un member state , that was true for the republic of china too . 
  then one day it became more strategically useful to diplomatically recognize the mainland 's government instead . 
  how did that work out ? 
  you realize that this entire argument can also be applied to taiwan vis a vis beijing . 
  this is why sticking purely to a de jure argument will not work out in the long run . 
  we 're talking about a country which is : - strategically insignificant - a tax haven - a friend of putin - costs the rest of the eu money - contributes little if nothing to the rest of europe ( or any other strategic partner ) so ... my main point here is that the de jure situation can change . 
  especially considering that turkey is occasionally a useful strategic ally . 
  even your own country 's government has probably tossed aside the legal legitimacy of taiwan because it 's more strategic to deal with mainland china . 
  [ am i right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_relations_of_taiwan ) ? 
  sorry , but this is about as thin or as floppy as an argument can get . 
  `` we can do it because other countries recognize our sovereignty , but you ca n't because other countries do n't recognize your sovereignty '' ... is just an appeal to differences in the ** de jure ** ( but not the ** de facto ** ) situation of the matter . 
  problem is , that the de jure situation can change quickly , while the de facto one takes time and energy to resolve . 
  this is especially the case because cyprus ' value to either the eu or the nato alliance is questionable at best . 
  ( turkish contribution to the alliance on the other hand , though not without its complications is slightly more meaningful than the mostly symbolic contribution of most of european nato to the alliance ) . 
  if cyprus really wants to make this sort of fig-leaf difference actually somewhat meaningful , then they actually should make cyprus meaningful . 
  because as things currently stand , i have a hard time seeing the value of recognizing the sovereignty and a having bilateral relations with a small vacation island whose main notoriety in the news lately is that they a tax haven which has flirty relations with putin , and who 's mis-handling of their domestic economy just costs the rest of europe money . 
  so in short , they cost europe money , they cost america money , and contribute nothing whatsoever , and are not actually strategically significant either . 
   ok , since you mentioned the bailout again , i have to ask , because i did n't really understand this point . 
  okay , well , the main thing to say here is that the rescue of the east was formally called the `` vienna initiative '' , and consisted of rescuing the 17 largest transational banks operating in the region , under the condition that they would refrain from panicking and selling all of their eastern european holdings/assets . 
  it came with virtually no strings attached for the partner countries involved , and was a coordination of the ebrd , ecb , and german and austrian cbs mostly . 
  it was so successful that by 2010 , dg ecfin published an economic brief about the situation in poland asking if the crisis had ever even come to the east , which is amazing because in early 2009 , poland and hungary had been in deep trouble . 
  the reason it was so strategic get get that done was that eastern europe 's banking sector consists of local affiliates of mostly western european banks . 
  the trouble is , that these eastern affiliates are so large and central to the banks in question , that their collapse would certainly kill many of these banks as a whole , which in turn would put some of the smaller member nations like austria and belgium into a situation resembling that of iceland or cyprus both of whom collapsed largely because their largest banks were so heavily invested in neighboring foreign markets that they ended imported foreign economic problems ) . 
  in contrast , the greeks were given conditional bailout loans ( seven rounds of them ) , which had increasingly severe austerity as a condition for release of loan funds . 
  the trouble is , that austerity kills economic growth ( thereby reducing the ability to repay loaned funds as planed ) . 
  that 's essentially the same sort of bailout plan which already failed in south america during the 1980s and 1990s . 
  argentina had four rounds of that from 1999 to 2002 . 
  and i think that this sort of policy was deeply incompetent on the part of the europeans for three reasons : - the eu actually had crisis response mechanisms ( efsf and esm ) , and had a central bank which they could have used , but chose not to ( mostly because merkel was against it ) . 
  - the exact same policy had already failed in argentina . 
  - the worst part of this is that screwing this up lead to the spread of the greek crisis to other eu member nations . 
  in terms of economic fundamentals , there was no reason that portugal had to end up in crisis ( except that if all investors are afraid of a portuguese collapse , and start selling everything portuguese ... then portugal will collapse regardless of what its fundamentals are ) . 
  so , i should qualify my earlier statement by saying that the east got bailed out competently , while the south saw , delays , austerity conditionalities , and subsequent contagion of the greek financial crisis . 
   neither side should let their frustrations or stereotypes cloud their judgements when making pragmatic decisions . 
  hopefully we 'll all learn how to cooperate together better in the future . 
  well said . 
  i agree with you there . 
  also , i never said that the criticism from bxl was n't unfair in at least some places . 
  for example , i 'd say that the fact that the south of europe did n't get bailed out , while the east did , is in no way the fault of anybody in poland , hungary cz or sk . 
  those were decisions taken mostly in frankfurt , berlin , and vienna , as well as the fault of brussels for not taking its own job more seriously ( all that inaction really , really frustrates me ) . 
  if anything , i 'd say that what went down in the east as a result of the 2009 financial crisis should serve as an example for how european institutions can work well with member-nations as well as transnational private sector entities to solve problems when that is what needs to get done . 
  it 's dw .
