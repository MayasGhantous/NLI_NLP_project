  10 years later , they 're supposedly net contributors to the tax base . 
  based on that study , the americans did a study about cubans who arrived in the mariel boat crisis ( who also seem to be doing well in the us , despite all the bs portrayed in the film scarface ), 
   it does n't . 
  tell that to the united kingdom . 
  tell that to france . 
  look at who was president there before hollande . 
  then look up geert wilder 's background . 
  and then get back to me . 
   once owning an empire and being an ex colony with no seriously defined ethnic component is n't the same . 
  i did n't say it was the same . 
  i said that this idea of an ethnic nation-state breaks down the moment that you guys decided that you guys needed , gurkhas , \u00e9volu\u00e9s , pied-noirs , afrikaners , and the french foreign legion in order to run your damn empires . 
  sure , it worked out okay at the time , but including those guys in your nations ended up being part of the deal . 
  even the austrian empire had poles , slovaks , and hungarians living its capital as a result of it 's empire . 
  i understand if you 're seeing it from the pov of a place like finland , or slovakia , who never had overseas empires . 
  but that 's a radical departure from the reality that took shape in the context of the british ( and french , and dutch , and belgian ) empire . 
  europe has diversity for a different reason ,  there is a thought that anyone can be an american , well , the thought about pied-noirs is `` these are the people whom we tried to settle in algeria . 
  but ... it did n't work out '' . 
  when it comes to foreign legion , as well as the gurkhas ( and african-born indian communities ) , it 's more like `` without these guys , the empire would never have been possible . 
  and we reeeeeaaaallllly wanted an empire , so we decided to include them in our nation '' . 
  it 's the same kind of shit the romans used to do with their allies during ancient times . 
  it 's been 2000 years , but the game has n't really changed . 
  your migrants integrate totally differently and much more readily adopt the american identity . 
  not sure if most european countries ever herded their immigrant minorities into camps the same way we did with the japanese though . 
  i know that in eastern europe this was ( and still is ) a thing , but mostly we 're tlaking about minorities who have been around for centuries , in the case of eastern europoe . 
   there is a strong ethnic component of identity here that obviously the usa does not have given it is a truly multi-ethnic ex colony nation . 
  imo , this breaks down for any country who used to have a globe spaning empire , and then ended adopting large numbers of colonists ( like africaaners , pied-noirs , etc ) , collaborators ( like gurkhas , belgian evolues , indians placed in africa by the british empire , etc ) , and mixed childer ( like indo-dutch or anglo-indians ) . 
  today , the wealthy & developed former colonial powers have lots of minorities , whose communities in cities like london , amsterdam , or paris , or brussels can be traded back directly to the needs , interests , and circumstances of colonial times . 
  take for example , the politically ironic personalities of geert wilders ( indo-dutch ) , or of nicolas sarkozy ( whose ancestors were in the french foreign legion ) . 
  ** that 's ** the modern reality in a number of europe 's most developed and mordern nations today . 
  as for germany , well , in their case , they really did need people to man the factories and re-start their economy , after most the men in the entire country found out the hard way that invading russia in the winter is a really bad idea . 
   migrants from a developed country vs. that 's why i mentioned the chinese and the polish . 
  those were some of the poorest nations around at the time they were coming to the us . 
  poland then was much , much poorer than most mena nations are today . 
   here 's a huge difference between migrants and refugees . 
  also true . 
  one of those is about people fleeing from war / dicatorship/persecution . 
  after wwii , all the world 's civilized nations signed a treaty about those , and legally-speaking , acceptance or rejection is decided based on how shitty the situation they 're leaving behind is . 
  the other is a group which are more self-serving in nature , and legally-speaking , the decision about acceptance or rejection is made based on the national interest of the country in question . 
  so , it 's legally a different type of decision . 
  in the states , it 's more comparable to the vietnamese-american and cambodian-american community today , or french protestants and irish-americans historically . 
  ok fine , but is n't most of the immigrant popiulation concentrated in the main cities like toronto and montreal ? 
  also ... is n't most of the country 's population concentrated within the first 100 miles north of the us border , while most of the frozen tundra is larfely uninhabited ( just like scandinavia ) ? 
  also ... 
  is n't germany having some problems with the fact that brandenburg has gotten so dramatically de-populated that they 're considering making it ( and other parts of former gdr a nature-reserve ? 
  is n't the former east germany seeing massive demographic decline , just generally ? 
  if you are just going to run around shouting `` it 's not the same !!, 
  ! 111 '' , then maybe it 'd be good if you also provided some kind of substantive details for this . 
  it reminds me of when people on / r/economics used to talk about us healthcare reform by saying `` it 's not the same !!, 
  ! 111 '' , as if americans & europeans were biologically different or something . 
  ( no hard evidence for `` it 's not the same !!, 
  ! 111 '' was ever forthcoming then , though . ), 
  you 're right about it being straightforward . 
  history is pretty clear about who made the decision , on that one , based on whose interest . 
  ** hint ** : that decision was taken the us gov. 
  in washington , in the interest of american national interest . 
  the first nations people did n't have established , modern countries . 
  and it 's not like they had an immigration program . 
  so , you 're right , it 's pretty straightforward . 
  we took that decision , in our own interest , and it turned out to suit our interest pretty well , all things considered . 
  setting 19th century history aside , i had no idea that native canadians felt this way about today 's foreign-born canadians ( which make up 1/5th of the population ) . 
  in any case , it 's also worth noting that , much like our situation , it 's moreso the government in ottawa who is making the decision on this based on their interest and their criteria . 
  so , the real question , how does ottawa ( and the people who elect the gov. 
  in ottawa ) feel about this . 
  given that the decision on this matter was made by the federal government at the time , and that we the main ports of arrival were coastal cities in the us , i think you really mean to ask how it worked out for anglo-americans . 
  amiright ? 
  the answer to that question is that while the polish-americans and chinese-americans were assimilated into the wider american population , the polish-american community has lost most of its connection with poland . 
   that situation was different . 
  average immigrant from europe was not really much less educated than an average american ... 
  finally , the cultural differences between different european countries are mostly nuances . 
  that is not what the people said at the time . 
  mostly complaints at that time was that immigrants from southern and eastern europe were uneducated peasants , and the fact that they were non-protestant was seen as a threat to the fabric of america . 
  during wwi , the wilson admin commented that european immigrant communities were `` pouring poison into america 's veins '' ( reference to the fact that they favored the central powers , and opposed american involvement in wwi ) . 
  even the statue of liberty poem refers to them as `` the teaming refuse of your shores '' ( literally , human trash ) . 
  ** today ** , people have come to see the differences as `` small nuances '' , but that is n't how the immigration of non-protestant southern and eastern europeans was seen at the time . 
   there is a stark difference in views on women and religion between the europeans and the migrants from mena . 
  truth be told , mena immigrant communities in the us have been about as successful as southern european communities , overall . 
  ( especially the lebanese-americans , who are kinda stereotyped as being obscenely capitalist , and the saudis who are stereotyped as throwing around obscene amounts of money , in the same way as russians are in europe ) . 
  the success of eastern european communities in the us on the other hand , had a lot to to with ethnic minorities from ee , being able to have a context free from the run-away bigotry and backwardness that characterized 19th-century eastern europe . 
   if germany need reasonably large influx of immigrants to deal with problematic demography , they will need it every single year so ... like canada then ? 
  well , it seems to work out ok for them . 
  also , this is not unlike what we did during the 19th century . 
  ( minus the whole making war on mexico & native americans part , i guess ) . 
  it 's funny you mention that . 
  it 's the same way the we originally felt about the polish . 
  and the chinese . 
  but it worked out ok in the the end . 
  and the children of those two communities are reasonably educated these days . 
   because as soon as we `` have taken out isis '' the problems in the regions will disappear and nobody is mad at anyone . 
  / s  that is n't the way that things worked out in the balkans . 
  things eventually returned to normal ( mostly ) , but just kicking milosevic 's ass did n't by itself , solve 100 % of all balkan problems . 
  but it sure helped . 
   `` remind me again why it is that you guys are too lazy to go and take saddam out ? '', 
  i was not in favor of taking saddam out . 
  before 2003 , the saddam-related threat was effectively contained . 
  now look at it . 
  remind me again why it is that you guys are too lazy to go and take isis out ? 
  i 'll trade two bosnians for three kosovars . 
  is that what you guys did with the bosnians and the croats ? 
  a better question is - what ability does europe have to keep the situation in order ? 
  apparently none , if french efforts can be embarrassed by as few as 100 people with no resources and nothing to lose .
