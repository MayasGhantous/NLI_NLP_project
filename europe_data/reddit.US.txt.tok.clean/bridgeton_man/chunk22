  - why should italy care ? 
  last year , the eu ( and france in particular ) told italy that they were n't going to help italy at all . 
  so , italy initially responded by opening the border , and by refusing to give a shit about france 's whining . 
   he 's completely correct with that statement too . 
  we ca n't just let greece and italy deal with the problem by themselves and pretend it 's not our problem as well in the rest of europe . 
  ridiculously enough , that 's what the dublin principle comes down to, 
  remind me again what incentive exactly libya has to give 2 shits about mitigating what is mostly to them europe 's problems ? 
  are you guys paying them ? 
  good luck sending that `` strong message '' with almost no naval resources whatsoever . 
  and just to be clear if the libyans decide to do something about it ( they have a coast guard ) , any action they take is n't technically covered by nato 's article 5 . 
  so your usual tick of coming crying to us about your inability to manage the situation in the european neighborhood is n't going to work out this time . 
  ( we 're kinda busy with the whole south china sea issue at the moment ) . 
  not sure if `` start doing nothing '' was ever the solution to anything . 
  i know that it seems to be at the center of all european foreign policy these days , but i 'm just saying that it 's likely to ** fail ** you guys ... ( ** again ** ) . 
   allowed to set a foot in given that you guys are trying to deal with people by the hundreds of thousands , and these guys have already decided to risk their lives ... what exactly are you planing to do about it ? 
  it 's not as if europe has sufficient ships , personnel , security forces , or resources to actively have the power to `` allow '' or `` not allow '' a damned thing . 
  which is exactly what today 's news is about in the first place . 
   we can dump then on some ship ... you actually needs ships for that . 
  which you guys basically do n't have . 
  not in sufficient numbers or with sufficient personnel and fuel anyways . 
  which is also what today 's news is about . 
   sure , but italy spain and greece have navies and should also have something to say about it . 
  insufficient . 
  the italians have been pretty staightforward about the fact that their navy is too small and too under-resources to patrol the med on its own . 
  and considering that only about 1/8th of 2015 's refugees actually entered via the italian route , this does not bode well for the even smaller and more under-equipped greek navy . 
  to say nothing of the idea that these naval powers might also need to bribe the transit countries involved in order to accept this whole entire thing . 
  i ca n't imagine any country just `` being cool with '' a foreign country doing that sort of thing . 
  no matter how long you wait . 
  it would be more efficient to either 1 . send some troops to put a stop to the problem at its source ( s ) . 
  which is what we did in bosnia . 
  2 . be prepared to sign a treaty involving a hefty bribe to the transit country in question ... which is what you guys are busy trying out with the turks ( how 's that working out for you ? ), 
  3 . continue doing nothing and hoping the situation will magically improve by itself . 
  that is n't really my point . 
  my point is that if you want to `` dump them all in somebody else 's country '' , you might find out that said country has an army and a navy that would have something to say about it . 
  at that point , your options are : 1 . send your country 's military to deal with the situation 2 . 
  bribe that country ( this is what australia does ) . 
  stfu about the matter . 
  not relevant . 
  my point is that france can ** talk ** tough , but when the rubber hits the road , they just do n't have the resources to do anything on their own . 
  at all , whatsoever . 
  all they can do is ** talk tough ** . 
  and that fact was just demonstrated by as few as 100 people, 
  what do you suggest then ? 
  considering that the libyans will definitely not be cool with this , is the finnish army gon na go help the rest of europe deal with this ? 
  have the finnish army done anything useful to help this situation thus far ? 
  i 'm guessing no . 
  am i right ? 
  ** because sovereignty ** the eu has been too lazy to make any treaties to that effect with libya . 
  and doing it illegally might cause the libyan navy to respond militarily . 
  i used to work for a foreign embassy in washington . 
  they used to refuse deportations as a consistent matter of policy . 
  and to be honest , any country would have the same response . 
  as an american who used to live in florida , and now lives in nice ... 
  i can not say that this is any sort of surprise . 
  france does n't have sufficient personnel or resources to do anything on anything more than a symbolic level . 
  and their non-cooperation with italy on this matter has already caused the italians not to be concerned about france 's concerns on this . 
  when push comes to shove ... ** france simply does not have the resources to deal with this ** . 
  and there is no sense in pretending otherwise . 
  the eu is in no position to make threats of any kind . 
  and with turkey , even less so . 
  like it or not , they are a strategic us ally , which actually has an army & security forces ( the eu basically does n't ) , but who also strategically border russia and the middle east ( so they could always change alignment ) . 
  also , they are a major buyer of us arms . 
  and they supply gas to europe . 
  so , they matter in ways that the more effeminate european allies do n't ( and this is regardless of whether or not they can actually be trusted ) . 
  which is part of what the problem is in the first place . 
  why do you lazy fucks free-ride the alliance when you could be sending troops to take matters into their own hands ? 
  is it cowardice ? 
  what ? 
  i 'm so surprised that the eu fails at doing anything whatsoever to manage the situation in its near-abroad . 
  those were the terms of the eu-turkey deal . 
  were they not ? 
  in principle , you need to actually have security forces with real budgets instead of a handful of disjointed and underfunded coast guards . 
  you need to have gendarmes . 
  more than 4 of them . 
  you also need to have working agreements with other countries in the near-abroad . 
  the eu does not have any of these things . 
  which is why we 've seen the issue take shape in the way that it has . 
   it 's not nato 's job to end the war , it 's national governments job to protect your borders from infiltration . 
  ok , but i 'm not really sure if that 's the kind of policy stance which is going to succeed in preventing syrians from deciding to gtfo . 
  i still remember yugoslavia . 
  the main thing that convinced bosnians and kosovars from decided to gtfo of where they were was the usaf telling milosevic to stfu . 
  and, 
   the reason why cubans risk being food for sharks is because they know `` wet foot dry foot '' given that the wet-foot-dry-foot law only dates to the 1990s , i think that this would be akin to saying `` cubans did not come to florida prior to 1995 '' . 
  which just is n't true . 
  and then there are the haitians , who do not benefit from the wet-foot-dry-foot law . 
  who also come by raft ( their journey is even longer and riskier than ours is ) . 
   if the european union made a clear statement `` you are not getting saved , we are not taking you , we will let you drown '' cuban-american here , in the caribbean , the threat of drowning at sea . 
  and the threat of becoming shark-food did not manage to prevent us from leaving castro behind . 
  same goes for the haitians and the dominicans , by the way . 
  sometimes conditions are shitty enough that you just decide to gtfo . 
  cuban-american here , as the child of refugees , i 'll just point out that being a refugee is about gtfo-ing from where you happen to be . 
  often , any destination will do . 
  often , gtfo-ing even seems like a good idea even if there is some risk of death involved . 
  for my family gtfo-ing from castro was worth risking death . 
  but syria is divided between a russia-backed dictator not unlike castro , and decapitation-happy death cult that europe does ** nothing whatsoever ** about , even as it both plans attacks in europe and also sends over a million refugees their way . 
  it 's pretty straightforward just exactly why people are risking death to get away from that place . 
  but the real question is , what exactly is europe going to do about it ? 
  aside from [ ** trying to ignore the situation in syria ** ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/13/6e/8f/136e8fd6b17d9fed1cd9ea2e40032dec.jpg ) and seeing if that works . 
  agreed . 
  this is essentially a reality check .
