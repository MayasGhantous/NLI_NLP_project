  the european allies have been free-riding our defense umbrella for decades . 
  and washington has been complaining about it for at least 10 years . 
  the only thing that was missing was somebody crass enough to blurt this out in public . 
  i seriously wonder what the european extreme right makes of this . 
  wilders was even there at the republican convention to watch trump call his nation out for free-riding . 
  i mean sure , ukip , pvv and fn , and so on are happy to to hate on others , but i 'm pretty sure that they 're made just as uncomfortable as everybody else . 
   clearly he was in a conflict zone he was in a town in the west bank . 
   occupational hazard . 
  this is a pretty solid description of the idf in the west bank . 
  an occupational hazard to any civilian in the area . 
   eu should better try to track down how palestinians spend their budget , half of which is donated by eu taxpayers . 
  i understand where you are coming from . 
  frankly ** we ** also need to be asking hard questions , given that a sizeable portion to the israeli budget come from ** our ** taxpayers, 
  reasonably sure that i could google up `` civilian casualties gaza '' or some such , and take about 2 seconds to dispel this notion . 
  but also , i had a ta in college who was friends with a camera crew wherein one of the guys got straight-up shot in the neck by an apc , while walking around with a camera and a white flag ( but admittedly , that was more than 12 months ago ) . 
  and since he was part of a camera crew , go around with a camera is literally meeting the definition of `` civilians just going about ** their business ** '' just saying . 
   palestine was offered to have a country recognised by the international community and they turned down every chance they got , because they could not accept the fact that the jews would have one too since 2000 , it 's been literally the other way around ( ie , israel saying `` no palestinian sovereignty for you '' , or `` your elections were not legit '' , etc ) . 
  and the sticking point has mainly been the illegal settlements more than anything else . 
  and 2000 was ** sixteen years ago **, 
  maybe a more serious source instead of low-grade propaganda ? 
  i once saw a one-hour interview with golda meir ( sp ? 
  ) , where she ( among other things ) , lays out the case in flat , neutral-toned manner . 
  it was the only time i 've seen the case made in a non-propagandistic tone , which really did turn out to be more convincing . 
  okay , but how many deaths have been caused by the idf and other security services against civilians during that same period ? 
  yeah ... we should probably be less unconditional about that . 
  imo , we should move to a more conditional sort of relationship , along the lines of what we have with our other allies in the world, 
  it 's more of a giant prison camp . 
  a matter of lack of hard power ( and hungarian unwillingness to admit that fact ) . 
  last year , around 800,000 people crossed though that country . 
  an army consisting of a small number of under-prepared and under-equipped troops with no experience in dealing with refugee flows has so far not even remotely stood a chance . 
  by comparison , the last time the us saw a mass refugee flow , was the 1994 cuban boat crisis . 
  it took 45,000 refugees to completely overwhelm the us coast guard . 
  and the us coast guard is actually institutionally competent . 
  meanwhile , the hungarians mostly likely had no level of equipment , preparation , or organization whatsoever . 
  incidentally , it 's also the reason that there are no hungarian troops in any of the countries whose conflicts are creating the refugees in the first place . 
  but at least this time around it 's not as embarrassing as the hungarian total lack of response to bosnia and kosovo ( which were right next to hungary ) . 
  ** [ citation needed ] **, 
  so ... does this mean that their pointlessly stupid wire-fence was almost as successful as the hungarians had hoped ? 
  i have an idea !, 
  why do n't they just deploy that stupid camera woman whose only skill in life appears to be kicking running children ? 
  i 'm sure that 'll work !, 
   are you insane ? 
  these are civil wars , we have no business to interfere . 
  it 's your choice . 
  either you can do something about it , or deal with the consequences of doing nothing about it . 
  that 's where we differ from you guys . 
  we tend to worry about making sure our interest is secure when there 's a local civil war in our near-abroad . 
  and we 've been doing that [ since 1910 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexican_revolution ) . 
  but we 've made it a point to give a shit about what happens in our neighborhood [ since 1823 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monroe_doctrine ) you might want to sit there and make jokes about this or that american leader , but we 've always handled this as a matter of realpolitik . 
  leaders change . 
  but core national interests do n't . 
   returning the boats australia style that would actually require a navy . 
  one large enough not to get overwhelmed . 
  our most recent maritime refugee wave occurred in 1994 , when 45,000 cubans came to florida on rafts . 
  that number was sufficient to overwhelm the us coast guard . 
  if you consider that the paper greek navy and the cardboard italian navy spent 2015 dealing with ** 23 times ** that many refugees , you get a idea of how large the problem has grown , and why it might have been a better idea to deal with it while the problem was still manageable in size ( but you chose for the consequences of doing nothing whatsoever ) . 
   we have an agreement with these clowns and need to take their fuckups by quota . 
  also , everyone who slips trough the incompetents security farce ends up claiming asylum here with no way of deporting them - the swiss are in no position to tell the neighboring european countries that their security forces are both too insufficient/underfunded and too lazy to go deal with problems in the european neighborhood . 
  - i guess you could try to do things like defend your borders , report asylum seekers , and so on , but , that actually requires have more than 14 soldiers in your gendarmerie , and also sufficient logistical resources to actually do the deportations , and also agreements with whichever country it is that you intend to deport them all to . 
  as it is , switzerland has an air force that does n't work on the weekends , and no relations regarding migration to any country outside of the eea . 
  so frankly , you guys do n't have the necessary resources and organization at this time . 
   i take issue with people hindering any debate about the shitty asylum abuse circus we are running here by claiming it has something to do with morality or `` muh feelingz '' . 
  it is time for an honest , productive discussion , not virtue signalling and it must start with the purpose of temporary asylum as well as the fact that it does n't help people who are really in need of help . 
  well , as i said earlier , i 'm not really here to debate the ** should ** . 
  i 'm here to debate the ** de facto ** . 
  i spent last year living near the french/italian border , and i saw first hand that both the italians and the french talked tough , but actually did not have hard-power to back any of their tough-sounding rhetoric . 
  my main point is that the french are n't going to prevent 150,000 refugees from crossing via the italian border with 160 gendarmes in the middle of a mountainous border region ( they literally tried this last year ) . 
  my main point is that the ** cardboard ** italian navy with 8 ships and half a tank of gas between them , in it is in no position to patrol med . 
  and even if it were , the situation in syria and libya rages on , so people are going to keep coming ( unless isis somehow turn into a bunch of peaceful hippies ) . 
  and even when that is brought under control , you still have ukraine , the balkans , and wherever putin might decide to invade next . 
  you guys are gon na need to get your shit together in the lr , or else you will keep seeing consequences of your own laziness and inaction . 
  on the other hand , when al-qaeda decided to set up a caliphate in mali , and start raiding algeria , the french immediately said [ ** nope ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval ) . 
  it ojnly took them a couple of weeks ( and they got the support of six eu allies ) . 
  result : aqim is no longer a thing . 
  but isis still is . 
  so , to me all of this endless bullshitting about how europe 's vagina is made uncomfortable by millions of syrian and iraqi refugees is a huge distraction from the real truth of the matter . 
  the fact that the eu could do in syria and in libya exactly what the french did in mali . 
  but they chose not to . 
  enjoy . 
   sudan is in eastern africa . 
  that 's not anywhere near europe - they have to cross the desert and the mediterranean as well as a lot of major population centers . 
  i think this is beside the point . 
  in principle `` near-abroad '' is the region nearby enough that internal things happening there have an immediate effect on internal things happening in your domestic region . 
  for us , we get refugees and migrants from haiti and central america when shit goes wrong there . 
  the fact that said refugees need to sail past cuba or walk through mexico and ** `` should '' ** be asked to stay there is really beside the point . 
  everybody else here might be content talking in terms of `` should '' , but i 'll just stick with `` does and is '' . 
  much more relevant . 
  when shit goes wrong in places like haiti , they come here the fact that they have sail past both cuba and bahamas to get here is something that nobody seems to care about . 
  which is why we sent troops there to try and stabilize the situation . 
  which is what you dudes keep not doing . 
  okay , i 'll grant you that there are eu troops in mali , and kosovo now , but how many are in ukraine , libya , lebanon , and syria ? 
    mostly because wars create refugees  tough . 
  yeah . 
  for you . 
  you 've done nothing whatsoever to mitigate either syria or libya ... and now you are living with the consequences . 
  the unhcr figure is now at 1.2 million persons is n't it ? 
  if we had done nothing the last time there was a coup in haiti , we might be in the same boat . 
  which is why there 's a un mission there now . 
  it 's also why we cooperate with both cuba and mexico on this issue . 
  we take our near-abroad seriously .
