   we are being forced into charity . 
  not really . 
  my point is that whether you like it or not , the war in syria and the situation in libya has generated refugees . 
  and they are coming in numbers that are able to completely overwhelm any european capability to do anything whasoever about it ( other than whine like pussies on the internet of course ) . 
  all the `` should '' in the world is n't going to change that fact . 
  which is why ** we ** send troops to the kinds of places which threaten to turn into major sources of refugees . 
  maybe if the european allies were n't so busy free-riding the alliance , they 'd have the capability to do something similar too . 
  i realize that you 're flying the swiss flag , so it does n't relate to you so directly , but as long as you 're surrounded by the eu , and have a mountainous , easy-to-hide-in border with several eu member nations , you 're pretty much in the same boat , in the de-facto sense ( keep in mind that i 'm focusing on what ** is ** instead of what ** `` should be '' ** ), 
  mostly because wars create refugees , and our free-riding european allies did nothing whatsoever to prevent/manage their own neighborhood , and just hoped that there would magically be no consequences from that . 
  hopefully in the future they will learn to pay attention to the shit going down in their own backyard . 
  realpolitik : this is the type of shit that happens when you ignore your local problems . 
  i 'm already based in brussels . 
  a lot of my views are shaped by american and eu expats who work here . 
   but no , seriously , even though i have no inside knowledge whatsoever about how it really works in the eu institutions , i find it hard to believe that there could be stupid/incompetent people working there . 
  i would say that eu institutions probably attract highly intelligent people the problem is n't the individual people . 
  they are indeed highly competent . 
  the issue is more about broken incentives , poor democratic accountability , a strategic/military tendency to free-ride our alliance , and inability to reconcile the various short-term national interests . 
  but also , keep in mind that a lot of the eu institutions that were tested in 2008-2010 were completely new , and had n't yet had their trial by fire as institutions . 
  for example , when cee was bailed out successfully in 2009 by the vienna initiative , there was no hard and fast rule saying that the best practices had to be implemented in the euro-med region . 
  another example is the rise of european macroprudential policy . 
  for some reason , it was implimented in 2010 . 
  nobody thought to include eu-wide banking and financial regulations when they created the eurozone in the first place ( 1992 maastricht treaty ) . 
  a crisis had to happen first , it seems . 
   eu/nato membership can be used as a carrot to motivate the countries to reform . 
  with mena countries it 's not possible , they 're never getting in the eu since they 're not european countries . 
  i have some friends in brussels who feel that it would probably be best if , in the lr , the eu developed other sorts of carrots aside from offering eu membership . 
  in any case , the us is able to offer carrots of a more diversified nature too . 
  with mena , i think that the sort of carrots offered to small , nearby countries could be more like institutional , military , and economic support ( like what we 've offered to south korea or taiwan ) . 
  in exchange for democratic reforms , as well as institutional & economic reforms . 
  the sorts of reforms that we 've seen in cee since the breakup of the ussr would make a good blueprint for suggesting reforms in tunisia and lebanaon specifically , imo . 
  but both of those countries also need mlitary support to secure their borders . 
  part of the problem for both countries is the flow of militants and arms across remote and difficult to patrol borders . 
  the way i see if , if we can put a few thousand personnel & materiel at the korean border , then our nato allies could probably put a few hundred and the tunisia/libya border , or the israel/lebanon/syria border . 
  then come the fact that both of these countries sit next to warzones . 
  the eu could be helping to settle the refugees those countries already have ( which would prevent those refugees from streaming across the med ) . 
  in a `` better late than never '' sense , this seems like what the eu 's refugee deal with turkey looks like . 
   on the top of that , not all mena countries want our help , or rather they 're fine with getting eu 's money , not eu 's advice on how to run their country . 
  i agree that eu fucked up big time with tunisia , but other countries/their leadership simply are n't interested in turning themselves into liberal democracies . 
  see , i 'm of the impression that if the situation in tunisia can be fixed , then it will change attitudes in the rest of the region . 
  they explicitly did want a parliamentary democracy , secular law , and a parliamentary democracy . 
  imo , the eu could have helped by keeping the elections legit . 
  as for the law and the institutions , tunisia already has french civil law , and institutions roughly based on those of france ( so the eu could have helped make sure that they function properly ) . 
  but keeping the libyan border closed , and the economy growing was probably key . 
  by a similar token , the way that we related to taiwan , japan , south korea , and south vietnam during the cold war , actually changed a lot of attitudes in the region about both capitalism and democracy . 
  the communist chinese trope was that `` communism is compatible with traditional confucianism ( dprk still says this ) , while western capitalism will only undermine asian civilization and dignity '' . 
  the fact that we managed to support the us-aligned countries in the region ultimately made all the difference . 
  we could eventually persuade effectively by saying `` would you like to be like north korea , or like south korea ? '', 
   i might be a little bit cynical , but there is just no way to fix this . 
  the eu can do better job with the authorities that it currently has , they can do more damage control , or they can persuade the member countries to give them more funds/authorities to handle these type of situations and the member countries after some time of negotiating may grant the eu some more power in foreign/defense policy so it 's better equiped to deal with these issues . 
  i would say that at present , their institutions have show a poor level of competence . 
  the greek financial crisis showed this big time . 
  even when the cee countries were successfully bailed out in 2009 , the best practices from that could have been adopted and applied to the euro-med region ( especially spain and portugal ) , but the eu failed in that . 
  imo , european economic crisis response has been a failure , as much as the european response to the syrian civil war has . 
  when it comes to economic crisis response , another place to gather best practices from has been the uk and canada . 
  the uk actually brought over the director of the canadian central bank to spread canada 's best practices in the uk . 
  the eu could and should have followed suit . 
  at least on a policy level . 
   i think we will eventually have to enforce australian style migration policy anyway , only in much bigger scale . 
  even that would basically require the eu to develop the proper resources for the job . 
   we will have to make a deal with some african country which will let us run refugee/detention camps for migrants/refugees on their soil and we will only take the most vulnerable in . 
  this is a second reason for why it 's a good idea to cultivate the right types of relationships in the european neighborhood . 
   but they never should have done it in the first place , with or without the us help , ** because they did not have a proper plan on what to do after ** and you can see the results . 
  i agree that this part was a key oversight . 
   a deal on migrants with turkey should have been reached years ago , the same goes for other countries in africa and the middle east . 
  it 's one part of the solution . 
  other part is being active in development help , but it 's not enough , political pressure needs to be applied on the countries from which the migrants are coming and on the transit countries as well , so that they cooperate with us . 
  agreed . 
  i would take it a step further though . 
  imo , europe should be contantly on the lookout for small neighboring countries who , with economic , military and institution-building assistance can be transformed into 1st-world countries . 
  it 's something that we have done in korea , and that you have done in the balkans . 
  okay , south korea and slovenia & croatia are n't utopian wonderlands , but the positive role each country has played there is undeniable . 
  and both are modern capitalist democracies who help dispel myths such as `` democracy is fundamentally incompatible with traditional confucian culture ( or eastern-orthodox slavic culture ) ''  the truth is that the eu is weak . 
  individual countries like germany , france or the uk ( which just shot itself in the foot ) might be relatively strong , but the eu as a whole is weak . 
  sad but true . 
  i agree with you . 
  it 's a shame , because i would really prefer if it would actually work . 
  the question is ... ** how to fix it ? 
   well , no offense , but i would not be calling the us to help build stability in the middle east europe called us to help deal with libya ( not sure why you guys did n't do it yourselves . 
  and sooner than it actually got done ) . 
  now europe has called ** turkey ** for help in dealing with the effects of the syrian civil war . 
   europe needs to be more active in mena , but military interventions are not necessarily the best way to do it . 
  i agree wholeheartedly . 
  military situations tend to emerge when an underlying issue has been unresolved for quite a long time , and in a severe way . 
  i actually lived in south slovakia briefly in the early 2000s . 
  when i asked the local hungarians what they thought about joining the eu , the response i usually got was along the lines of : - * `` we can either do some institution building & development * *** or *** * local leaders can chose to ignore local ethnic tensions until this situation turns into bosnia 2.0 '' * when you look at the west 's interaction with eastern europe , you can see that besides the balkans , the situation in the caucasus and the situation in ukraine has pretty much evolved along the lines of what the slovak-hungarians used to talk about 10 years ago . 
  it has n't turned into bosnia , but the situations have gone military in both regions . 
  by the same token , the situation in mena is kinda like that . 
  i find it especially egregious that the arab spring started in tunisia as a movement of angry unemployed students and labor unionists who wanted to set up a parliamentary democracy and a capitalist economy ( they wanted to pretend to be europe , basically ) , but then when they succeeded , - the west ignored foreign tampering with their elections ( by qatar no less !, 
  ) , - we ignored the islamist electoral victory ( when the electorate was actually 30 % liberals + socialists ) , - we ignored subsequent sinking of their economy + rise in violence . 
  now the country exports jihadists to libya and to syria . 
  that was completely preventable . 
  when it came to libya , the post-conflict institution building has been minimal . 
  now isis has a foothold there , and the country exports refugees . 
  when it came to syria , we ignored the situation until isis became a thing . 
  that was unnecessary . 
   as for the coast guard - steps are being taken in the direction , frontex has just been granted more funds and if an eu country refuses to cooperate with it ( like greece did during the refugee crisis ) , other countries are free to close their borders with the uncooperative country . 
  yes , the events of 2015 definitely demonstrated that this is necessary . 
  italy was completely overwhelmed when the eu scaled back its naval operations there . 
  and the political consequences of italy 's outrage about that are likely to linger for quite some time . 
   nobody has such a magical solution which would make absolutely everybody happy .
