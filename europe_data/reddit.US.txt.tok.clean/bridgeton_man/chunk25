  but at least imo the eu will have to move to the `` keep migrants out of europe '' policy eventually they 'll first have to build a navy/coast guard , and also find the cojones to put troops on the ground in the places where the refugees are fleeing from in the first place . 
  ( and no ... calling us will not do the trick this time . 
  we are busy at the moment ) . 
   they never ever asked for this . 
  i disagree . 
  all eu countries who do not have troops in syria to prevent this from turning into a refugee crisis , are basically asking for this to turn into a refugee crisis . 
  it is n't that hard . 
  france did it in 2013 in mali . 
  and that 's what al-queda in the magreb is no longer a thing . 
   merkel invited them , she can clean up the mess she made . 
  while merkel was one of the european leaders refusing to do anything about the situation in syria , she is far from the only one . 
  what country are you from ? 
  how many troops does your country have in syria ? 
  if that number is ** zero ** ... then your country probably has no comment on the situation . 
  symbolically saying `` no '' and arresting 0.001 % of refugees is not going to mean anything to the 1 million + people fleeing from the war in syria . 
  well ... imo , it is n't exactly europe has much of a choice except to deal with the situation as is . 
  two key facts that shape this are : - europe has done nothing about the situation which is causing the refugees to come to you in the first place . 
  no troops in syria . 
  no troops libya . 
  so , european countries can either bitch about it ( and get nowhere ) , or they can do what france did to al-queda in mali in 2013 . 
  - the number of refugees that the syrian civil war has generated is already large enough to completely overwhelm any single eu country 's forces . 
  so , as far as the reality on the ground is concerned , it ** literally does n't matter what brussels says ** . 
  it also does n't matter matter what the member states respond to what brussels days . 
  - the so-called `` dublin principle '' ( whereby all the refugees need to stay in the transit country ) , was rejected by said countries . 
  especially italy . 
  in 2015 , renzi said that `` this either has a european solution '' or an `` italian solution '' . 
  what matters here is whether either europe , or the member states can come up with a viable response to italy 's concerns ( and not just pointless effeminate bitching ) . 
  well ... imo , it is n't exactly as the commission has much of a choice except to deal with the situation as is . 
  two key facts that shape this are : 1 . 
  europe has done nothing about the situaiton which is causing the refugees to come to you in the first place . 
  no troops in syria . 
  no troops libya . 
  the number of refugees that the syrian civil war has generated is already large enough to completely overwhelm any single eu country 's forces . 
  so , as far as the reality on the ground is concerned , it ** literally does n't matter what brussels says ** . 
  the so-called `` dublin principle '' ( whereby all the refugees need to stay in the transit country ) , was rejected by said countries . 
  especially italy . 
  in 2015 , renzi said that `` this either has a european solution '' or an `` italian solution '' . 
  then , the french told him to fuck off . 
  then the italians opened all of their northern borders and stopped cooperating with other eu countries on this issue . 
  the french found out the hard way that they can talk a tough game , but they do n't have enough gendarmes to keep from getting overwhelmed ( i was there ) . 
  since nobody has any other response to italy 's `` italian solution '' , there is n't much that brussels can do about it . 
  so europe can bitch , and whine , troll the internet , and complain about vaginal discomfort . 
  but at present , they do not have the resources to address the problem . 
  they should have thought about that when they were busy ignoring the arab spring . 
  and when they were busy free-riding the alliance . 
  if i could guess , it 'd be some form of the typical european response : - strongly enough to whine like effeminate bitches about the issue . 
  - strongly enough to symbolically put up a chicken-wire fence and arrest .001 % of refugees - not strongly enough to send troops to the region actually generating the refugees in the first place . 
  - but still strongly enough to ask *** other countries *** ( usa , turkey , etc ) to spend *** their *** resources on the issue . 
   our populations are heavily opposed to any military operations that risk the lives of our soldiers . 
  that sentiment was n't present in 2012/2013 though , when the french ( back by other european allies ) , flew troops into mali to help their government tell aqim to stfu . 
  why the sudden change of heart ? 
  why is the rest of europe acting * more effeminate than the french ? 
   well the cynic in me thinks this eu doesnt have a problem with whats going on in syria , or the refugees , because cheap labor is always nice not only to do menial tasks , but to keep wages of own population down , and those few doctors/programmers are a nice addition . 
  this does not seem likely . 
  what rational elected official in his right mind would want to deal with the sort of political fall out we 're currently seeing in europe ? 
  so far eu does not have a problem with whats going on in syria , or the genocide of yezidis , or the genocide of christians in iraq by isis . 
  sadly enough , this seems to be true . 
  at least , i 've encountered that sort of `` not my problem '' sentiment on this sub a lot . 
  and it 's exactly ** that ** sort of attitude in europe , which has lead to the refugees . 
  an opportunity to get involved before the arab spring turned into a conflict was squandered , as well as the opportunity to intervene when the conflict was small , as well as the opportunity to intervene when isis first reared its head . 
  they would 've been an easy target then , and the french had already taken out aqim in mali ( with some allied eu support ) with little-to-no effort . 
  so , a plan of action based on the european mission in mali could have been devised at that time . 
  but , a combination of laziness and cowardice took over instead . 
  hence refugees , as well as isis attacks in paris , brussels , and elsewhere . 
   and even if they did want to stop it , its not like they can do something about it - since its not assad or the legal syrian government which is perpetuating the genocides . 
  that was also true about milosevic . 
   because somehow assad is the bad guy , he is the milosevic , while you have eu doing business and actively encouraging saud house - who are actually milosevic and crushing poor people in yemen . 
  i see parallels with the balkan conflicts in that . 
  in the balkans , all sides could conceivably be called `` the bad guys '' . 
  just look at the wikipedia page for the hague tribunal points to the fact that all sides in the war have leaders who have been found to have committed crimes against humanity , war crimes , or some such . 
  the house of sunni side of this conflict are bad guys for sure , but so is the assad side . 
  so , why ca n't we just send the leaders of both sides to the hague , and we 've told isis to stfu ( now that we 've all idiotically ** waited until isis became a thing ** ) ? 
   well man , the yugoslav wars was not just ended because suddenly european/un peacekeepers appeared - the blue helmets were there from the start to watch the shit show unfold - and did nothing to stop it - and in fact watched as srebrenica happened . 
   that is a good point . 
  imo , if anything , the lesson of srebrenica is that nato should be prepared to use more muscle when people like milosevic ( or assad ) need to be told to stfu . 
  not less . 
   that war was ended when croatia launched its operation storm and reclaimed territory - lets say that military victory was half of the battle for peace , the other half as well as a political solution signed by all parties agreed . 
  this is another area where the events of the arab spring are not being taken seriously by our european allies . 
  iran , russia , and the gulf states all seem to care enormously about influencing this ( since 2011 !!, 
  ) , but europe just does n't give a shit . 
  so in a way , it 's no surprise that the results of the arab spring have been severely less than ideal for europe and its interests . 
  they made no actual effort to defend their interests , while ** even qatar ** tried harder than that ( the electoral victory of islamists in the 2012 tunisian elections can be traced to qatari financing ) . 
   also , fyi , there is foreign government forces in syria - countless eu countries have thier air-force bombing shit around in syria while you may have a point there , i think that we can both agree that there is just no substitute for boots on the ground . 
  it seems to me that the european allies have forgotten the lessons of srebrenica ( or never learned them in the first place ) . 
  it 's been so long since shit got real in the european neighborhood region , that they literally have ** no clue wtf they are doing ** . 
  hence ... refugees . 
  the us asks most of its allies to aim for 2.0 % ( which , incidentally , is also the nato recommended level ) . 
  if you european allies all contributed 2.0 % , it 's likely that the syrian civil war would not still be a thing . 
  and it 's especially likely that having allies who whine like pussies for american , turkish , or other outstide support instead of sending in marines , would not still be a thing . 
  our pacific-region allies do n't shamelessly free-ride . 
  so why do you ? 
  no worship please . 
  we 'd rather you just pulled your weight within the nato alliance and stopped with the shameless free-riding . 
  thanks . 
   i myself was a refugee for 6 years , yugoslav wars okay , in that case , let me ask you . 
  why did the europeans choose to eventually get involved in yugoslavia , while they are completely ignoring the syrian situation this time around ? 
  did the european allies just leave the cojones behind in kosovo or something ? 
  i 'm presuming that the european allies are about as thrilled to see syrian refugees as they were to see bosnian , serb , and kosovo refugees . 
  but for some reason , they managed to send peace keepers that time . 
  why ?
