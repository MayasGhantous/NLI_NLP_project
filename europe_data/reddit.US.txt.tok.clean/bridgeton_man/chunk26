   she 's literally personally responsible for the coming eu breakup because of her horrendous leadership ...  so she `` imports '' hundreds of thousands of people that 's total bullshit and you know it . 
  it 's a fact of life that you european pansies make weak and effeminate allies . 
  the sad fact of the matter is 1 . 
  while it 's true that merkel did nothing whatsoever to prevent or mitigate the syrian civil war that 's also true for most of the other free-riding allies in nato . 
  europe does n't have the security forces to say yes or no to one million refugees . 
  they do n't have enough navy . 
  they do n't have enough personnel , they do n't have enough ammo , and they damn sure do n't have the training to use any of it . 
  nor the cojones for that matter . 
  it 's ** still ** the case that no european country has sent troops into syria . 
  you can google up videos of isis beheading refugees , but if you try to google up videos of eu forces beheading refugees , you wo n't get any hits . 
  that 's should give you a clue as to which party the refugees are more likely to be scared of . 
  the fact that the eu has had to ask for ** turkish ** help is indicative that they europeans are ** in no way ** in control of the situation . 
  from the looks of things , they about to receive said reality check . 
   if europe actually gave a shit we could defend the baltics just fine yeah . 
  by crying out for our help . 
   if we have to protect our security , we will do it . 
  we have our doubts . 
  so far , it looks like europe 's usual first move is to call for outside help every time something goes wrong . 
  that 's what the deal with the turks consists of . 
  that 's what nato is ( see article v ) . 
  the coast guard is an armed force . 
  and more importantly , if you dudes were really serious about this entire matter , you would not be talking about piecing together thousands of naval vessels ( which you have n't currently got ) , and thousands of gendarmes ( sufficient to prevent 1-1 .2 million people who have already decided to risk their lives to get away from isis ) , which you also have n't got . 
  you 'd be talking about sending in a small number of elite troops to syria ( like what the french to al-q did in mali ) , followed by a small peace-keeping force ( like the one in bosnia ) . 
  one thing is to to posture meaninglessly about resources you do n't even have . 
  but going and solving the problem at its source is quite another . 
  when we see the sort of regional instability that threatens to send haitian , panamanian , mexican , or salvarorian refugees our way , we send the usmc and/or the cia to go deal with the problem at its source . 
  ** edit ** : when it was mexico , we actually [ sent the elite 13th cavalry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pancho_villa_expedition ) , but , you get the idea . 
   greeks were outnumbered in pretty much every war with the east . 
  are you talking specifically about the battle of thermopylae ? 
  because i 'm talking about how sparta fared in general . 
  and how the eu fares in general . 
  meh , that would require our european allies to step their defense budgets up to non-free-riding levels . 
  and , tbh , i 'll believe it when i see it . 
  the main european ally who actually contributes military assets instead of free riding the alliance , is called turkey . 
  sure , spain has one aircraft carrier , but have they used it against assad ? 
  against ghadaffi ? 
  against milosevic ? 
  or do they just free-ride us like most of our allies do ? 
  it hilarious that this solution is proposed by countries who not only have almost no military forces whatsoever , but not even a motherfucking coastline ( except for poland ) , let alone do they have the stomach to actually pay for naval assets themselves . 
   but that is what army is for . 
  i propose using the army for dealing with people like assad , ghadaffi , and milosevic , in the first place , so that we do n't have to deal with the problems they cause in the neighborhood . 
  are you talking specifically about the battle of thmopylae ? 
  because i was talking about how sparta fared in general . 
  generally , they maintained the sort of hard power resources and allies that they needed to look after their national interest . 
  until they discovered that their army was too small to deal with a huge mass of angry helots . 
  by contrast , the free-riding european allies have demonstrated time and again that they have insufficient resources to handle even their own near-abroad properly without asking for outside help . 
  while it 's true that the french and their allies [ ** handled the al-qaeda threat ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval ) in mali on their own , they basically ** fail ** in doing that in syria , ukraine , libya , and yugoslavia . 
  and that 's why you guys have the problems that you do . 
  if you 'd handled putin , ghaddafi , milosevic and assad like the need to be handled , then you would be seeing refugees from isis , eastern european mafia , yugoslavian guns on the black market , and putin at your front door . 
  the spartans actually had the proper resources for the job at hand . 
  did n't he ? 
  yeah , but the reality of the situation dictates that you get to chose one or the other . 
  you guys do n't actually have the resources to handle the syrian situation without turkish cooperation . 
  and no , we wo n't bail you out here . 
  and competent military forces & hard power assets . 
  you guys are n't going to be able to close down thousands of miles of coastline to 1 or 2 million people with the sort of naval assets and disorganized personnel that you 've currently got . 
  and that 's why we ask you guys to spend a minimum of 2.0 % on defense . 
  spending only 0.8 % while we spend 3.5 % to defend your sorry asses is just straight-up free-riding . 
  cut that shit out . 
  [ ** yeah ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state-sponsored_terrorism#libya ) . 
  aside from giving money gun and training to the ira , eta , the plo and others , he gave shelter to the terrorists who pulled off the [ lockerbie bombing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan_am_flight_103 ) . 
  a dictator giving shelter to terrorists . 
  also the guy had a nuclear program . 
  making friends with him was not cute . 
  we should never have saved your country from communism in 1949 and from the germans in 1944 . 
  it was a waste of money and lives frankly . 
   about the italian immigrants , please spare me with this abominable bullshit well , i was n't going to go there . 
  but it 's true . 
  the mafia ** is ** abominable bullshit . 
  thanks italy !, 
   about the syria situation , you paid them and trained them to make civil war against assad in order to upset russia and iran , the first 2 allies syran allies . 
  okay , so we took a giant dump in iran 's back yard . 
  and ... . . ? 
  if you guys did a more serious job of taking your own neighborhood seriously , maybe things would be different . 
  but you dont . 
  as you correctly stated , you make short-sighted deals with pro-terrorist dictators whom we 'd rather see dead . 
   and do not ever dare again to say those kind of bullshit in this subreddit . 
  if you did n't come after ghadaffi or assad , and you did n't come after milosevic either , then you probably wo n't manage to come after me either . 
   in europe we enough brain indeed . 
  you english grammar talk good !, 
   goodbye ciao . 
  so , you chose syrian refugees rather than turkish tourists ? 
  well , you 're not wrong . 
  realpolitik is still a thing . 
  yeah dude , even though i 'll admit that our side probably spent the early 2000s more terrorism-obsessed than is healthy , seeing one of our so-called `` allies '' making deals with a pro-terrorist dictator just because that 's how uncomfortable foreigners make them is just unconscionable ( especially by a country who used to pester us non-stop about how we were n't being nice to our italian immigrants ! ) . 
  we really should have stopped being allies over that one . 
   now that germany has imposed the turkish blackmail ... those are the consequences of not having control of the situation . 
  the sad fact of the matter is that neither the eu , nor any of its member nations has the hard-power resources to deal with the syrian situation or the libyan situation . 
  so , you guys are basically forced to come , hat-in-hand , to one of the few nato powers who does not free-ride the military alliance , and who actually has hard-power resources to contribute to nato . 
  see , if you guys had gotten off your asses and dealt with syria early on ( in 2011/2012 ) , then you would n't have 4 million syrian refugees on the move , and you would not have to come to the turks hat-in-hand like a bunch of effeminate pussies . 
  do n't thank me . 
  thank putin . 
  he 's been providing lots of laughs since he first came to power . 
   such a deal was never possible ( with iran/russia ) . 
  it was most likely possible prior to russian intervention . 
  now , the regime has a lot more power and influence . 
  but the military realities on the ground are still there concerning the kurdish regions ( although this is definitely something that the turks do n't like ) . 
  the fact that the fsa is the faction which has the least amount of influence on the ground is the result of everybody else ( iran , saudi , etc ) , paying more attn than the west . 
  it would have been nice to see them get some amount of sunni territory , seing as how they are a us ally . 
  the sunni triangle in iraq seems to be completely beyond iraqi control ( and has been a major recruiting ground for isis ) .
