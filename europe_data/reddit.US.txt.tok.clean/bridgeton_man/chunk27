  that would make another prime candidate for balkanization . 
   problem being though that if we do something we get accused of interfering and making the situation worse . 
  so what ? 
  people are already saying that as a result of you guys doing nothing whatsoever . 
  but at least this way our european allies wo n't all look like a bunch of effeminate pussies complaining about chronic vaginal discomfort . 
   is it too much to ask to expect the middle east to once and for all get it 's shit together was it too much to ask for *** the balkans *** to get their shit together ? 
  apparently it was , because back then everybody was on the same page about putting peacekeepers on the ground , and telling milosevic to stfu ( and the russian paratroops who showed up to protect the serbian side ended up not becoming a relevant factor ) . 
  but ultimately this is n't even the real question at the heart of the matter . 
  ** the real question ** is : - do you want to see 1 or 2 million refugees in europe ? 
  yes , or no ? 
  it 's a yes or no question . 
  no 3rd answer is possible . 
  it be better for europe if they read the memo sooner rather than later . 
   in syria ? 
  how should that one work ? 
   good question . 
  the answer depends on how early the eu would have been interested in taking action . 
  obviously , the appearance of isis , and later the russians has complicated it all . 
  overall , the dayton peace accords in the balkans had the effect of dissolving yugoslavia into its constituent parts , while putting peace keepers on the ground , and making it so that the new countries were obliged to respect the fact that their serbian/croat/albanian minorities in the new countries had the right to continue existing . 
  breaking those terms would result in nato bombing that country back into the stone age ( milosevic tried that , and lived out the rest of his days in the hague ) . 
  applied in syria , it 'd mean that syria could be dissolved into its component parts , all of whom have to respect the sunni/shia/christian / kurdish/yazidi minorities living in their territory . 
  and whoever tries to back out of that can be subjected to the milosevic treatment ( assad might try something funny ) . 
  after that , the neighboring countries who have adopted the bulk of the refugees ( especially lebanon ) , should also be getting help ( both peacekeepers and money ) to help deal with it all . 
  blaming ` murica is n't going to make this problem go away tough . 
  that 'd be like us blaming cuba for contributing to the civil wars in guatemala , el salvador , and nicaragua ( cuba supplied arms and advisers to the communist side ) . 
  we can blame them all we want , but that is n't going prevent refugees from fleeing the civil wars there . 
   noone has the ability to `` occupy and rebuild '' either country . 
  it is n't what you guys are doing in the balkans either . 
  over there , just the simple act of keeping the peace ( plus a small amount of eu assistance ) , has made a substantial difference to the situation . 
  you guys should just apply the solution used in bosnia . 
   can we just leave the middle east to eat itself out of existence whilst not seeing refugees ? 
  this is what you guys have been trying so since 2011 so far . 
  how is that working out for you ? 
  sure , ** we ** can do it . 
  ** canada ** can do that too . 
  but if your country exists within walking distance of syria and within canoe distance of libya , you might get different results than us . 
  by the same token , we make it a point to make sure that there are troops in haiti , an accord with cuba , and cooperation with mexico about the movement of central americans ( and we 've sent troops into mexico , panama & dr before ) . 
  all while we have covert missions in places like colombia and peru . 
  we take our neighborhood seriously . 
  you guys do n't . 
  that 's the difference . 
   why is it the obligation of western europe to deal with the fallout europe 's proximity to the situation directly means that the choice for them , is to either - do something or - see millions of refugees . 
  - [ ** here 's ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eufor_althea ) what you guys have chosen to do about bosnia . 
  - [ ** here 's ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval ) what the french chose to do about al-qaeda in mali pissing off the french - [ ** this ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eutm_mali ) was the eu 's followed-up response to france 's actions against al-qaeda - in a similar vein , a coup in haiti during the clinton years threatened to send us a buttload of refugees . 
  [ this was our response ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_uphold_democracy ) - [ ** this ** ] ( https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/aaeaaqaaaaaaaanzaaaajdk2mte2y2vkltc1yzctndvkos04njkzlwm0ymi4nzm4mzcwmq.jpg ) has been the eu 's response to the situation in syria thus far . 
  - [ ** this ** ] ( http://www.wolaver.org/animals/ostrich.jpg ) has been europe 's response to the libya crisis , which lead to the country 's civil war . 
  seen from my side of the atlantic , it does n't seem like the smartest possible way to deal with the european neighborhood . 
  as a washingtonian , i can reply that the view from washington is that the risk here is that provoking the turks based on pointless local xenophobia ** might ** drive them to distance themselves from nato and towards rapprochement with putin . 
  not ideal . 
  from the geo-strategic pov , it really would be a better idea if we were to just drop 2 or 3 of our most worthless european free-riding `` allies '' who contribute nothing to the alliance except for provocation of the turks or provocation of the russians ( both of which cost ** us ** money and lives ) . 
  in 2011 , the eu was faced with the choice of doing something about the arab spring , or watching millions so many refugees arrive in europe that the eu 's capacity to deal with them would be totally overwhelmed . 
  europe chose to see the refugees . 
  in 2016 , europe was faced with the choice of making a deal with turkey , which would mainly affect turkish tourism , or watching millions so many refugees arrive in europe that the eu 's capacity to deal with them would be totally overwhelmed . 
  europe chose to see the refugees . 
  i 'm curious to see what they 'll choose to do about this decision in 2018 . 
  in the mean time , enjoy this summer 's refugee movement . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , your country managed to symbolically arrest ** 60 ** of them ( out of 850,000 who traveled the balkan route last year ) . 
  personally , i would have chosen for the tourists .

  enjoy !,

  that 's what the word '' ** classified ** '' is for . 
   who is europe going to war with ? 
  while it 's difficult to foresee who all of tomorrows threats will be , there 's reason today to worry about : 1 . 
  putin 2 . 
  isis 3 . 
  the situation in north africa  maintaining a functional and combat-ready armies that can be deployed at a moment '' cost of this is impossible for eu . 
  are you saying that the world 's largest economic bloc ( gdp = 120 % that of the us ) , ca n't find ( or does n't feel like finding ) , sufficient funds to maintain the military capabilities to deal decisively with the potential threats in the immediate region ? 
  from a hard-figures perspective , that just does n't make a lot of sense . 
  if nato recommends spending 2.0 % of gdp on defense , and the smaller , wealthier european allies tend to spend less than 1.0 % ( nl spends 0.8 % , for ex ) , while my country spends 3.5 % , then the truth is that you guys are simply free-riding the american tax-payer . 
  and you should stop . 
  if you ask me , i would mainly say that this is the case due to europe 's lack of responsiveness ( or even capability to respond really ) , to to situations and crises in our own neighborhood . 
  and what 's worse is that europe is not just functionally impotent when it comes to dealing with milosevic or ghadaffi or assad , but also , dealing with more existential threats to europe ( putin ) is difficult . 
  and considering the size of the the eu population or economy , it is n't for lack of economic resources either . 
  how will europe be relevant on the world stage in the 21st century , when we ca n't defend their strategic interests in the face of the russians or the chinese , or even a small-time north-african dictatorship without relying on foreign help ? 
  how will europe even manage to deal with isis , when their ability to project power to even nearby countries , is limited at best , and when sovereignty is so weak that isis can do 3 or 4 mass-beheadings in libya and syria , causing 1 million + refugees to to completely and totally overwhelm the eu 's ability to control the situation on anything more than a symbolic level ? 
  what the plan for the next time putin decides to go on the rampage ? 
  have the eu ambassador send a letter of protest and then slap russia with some more economic sanctions ? 
  that 's not going to work . 
  old news . 
  this is from 2015, 
  mitt did similar things too back in 2012 . 
  it 'll become public news soon enough if you ask me . 
  if this happened in ` murica , there 'd be a court trail about it . 
  political parties just ca n't be accepting foreign funds here .
