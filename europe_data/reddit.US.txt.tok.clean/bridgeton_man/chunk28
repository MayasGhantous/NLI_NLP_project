  and that 's the way it should stay !, 
  this content sponsored by the committee for stating the obvious, 
  yeah , you did call us . 
  and you may claim it 's not your neighborhood all you want , but internal events in that country directly affect internal events in the european union . 
  which is exactly how you define `` near abroad '' in the first place . 
  whether you want to recognize it or not , is just a question of how close you live to the libyan coast . 
  i spent last summer living near the french/italian border , so i literally watched france try its hardest to pretend that situation was `` not their problem '' . 
  which lasted exactly until the italians got tired of hearing all of europe tell them that , and responded with `` an italian solution '' . 
  the french pretty much found out the hard way that 200 gendarmes trying to close their border to 150,000 refugees , with no italian cooperation , was just not going to work . 
  and that indeed made it `` a french problem '' . 
  so yeah . 
  it 's your if people can show up on a fishing boat , at the first sign of isis doing anything ... then by definition , it 's your neighborhood . 
  no matter how much you try to pretend . 
  as for us , we do not pretend when it comes to our neighborhood . 
  coup in haiti ? 
  we send troops . 
  civil war in mexico ? 
  we send troops . 
  and ... that was the problem to begin with . 
  why did you call us , instead of handling it yourselves ? 
  it is your neighborhood after all . 
   there 's no commitment to libya from us , and ... that was the problem to begin with . 
  why did you call us , instead of handling it yourselves ? 
  it ** is ** your neighborhood after all . 
  indeed !, 
  i applaud the fact that there have been serious changes to how seriously the netherlands takes their commitment to nato since srebrenica . 
  no ... do n't bother calling us . 
  use your own military resources ( meager though they are ) . 
  this is something that we are n't really interested in helping you with . 
  if you want to free-ride our alliance for the purposes of dealing with putin , that 's one thing , but the view in washington is that this local european-neighborhood stuff really is your responsibility . 
  not ours . 
  yeah ... but suddenly everybody 'd be inexplicably hungry . 
  all at once . 
   you do know the eu has nations with substantial armies ? 
  the 0.8 % of gdp figure was specific to the netherlands . 
  but yes , we can see just how substantial the eu militaries are by how efficiently they get out there to deal with crises in the european neighborhood . 
   nobody wants the massive us bases in europe but you know who does want them ? 
  the baltic republics , the poles , and the czechs seem to be pretty pleased about our presence on their territory . 
  i 'm not saying that they should handle putin on their own . 
  but i am saying that they should pull their weight within the alliance . 
   you do n't protect the world , this is what others claim until the moment that putin , milosevic , and/or ghadaffi start acting up . 
  when that happens , they tend to remember that it 's actually ** the european allies ** who fail most at protecting things . 
  where would we be today if you guys had decided in 2011 to take the arab spring more seriously ? 
  where would we be today if you guys had decided to take milosevic more seriously 20 years ago ? 
  i bet that a lot more people would be alive today . 
  and there 'd be a lot fewer refugees too . 
   better build some ~ ~ more ~ ~ ships first . 
  ** ftfy **, 
  because nato you free-riding assholes . 
  by having a military expenditure of 0.8 % of your gdp instead of 2.0 % ( the nato recommended level ) , you are too weak to do anything aside from sending unarmed peacekeepers . 
  to weak to help out with managing the european neighborhood , and cost us buttloads of money because ** we ** end up picking up the slack . 
  it 's the geo-strategic equivalent of not chipping in for gas money , or not paying your share of the rent . 
  what france is trying to propose is that they ** finally ** found a way to help pay for rent and gas within the free-riding alliance . 
  they are doing something . 
  it 's called refusing their waters to eu vessels . 
  they do n't want to deal with this issue either . 
  and they have no concrete reason , in terms of national interest , to do you guys any favors . 
  in principle , that means that you 'd need some sort of treaties with the countries in north africa . 
  i guess it 's a good thing that you guys took the time to make sure that the arab spring went smoothly in the first place so that you could have viable partners with whom to sign any such treaty . 
  sounds like a great plan . 
   i think you 're underestimating the level of precision weapons used by the idf - did n't they once kill the head of hamas ( i think it was hamas ) by firing a helfire missile from a drone into the open window of his car door , killing him and only him ? 
  - did n't shin bet once kill a fatah bomb engineer by detonating a small semtex charge in his cell phone ? 
  - is n't mosad suspected of being the party responsible for assassinating an iranian nuclear engineer by attaching a magnet-bomb to his car in rush hour traffic ? 
  - is n't the israeli spice munition considered to currently by the world 's most highly developed smart munition ? 
   i do n't really understand this part , alliances are based on military alliances , just as much as they are ideological . 
  i mean that trade relations are are fine , and so is the sale and mutual development of defensive weaponry , but i just can not endorse the fact that we 've sold some of our best offensive weapon systems . 
  the f-15 eagle being the example that most comes to mind at the moment . 
  afaik , israel 's ability to defend its airspace with the kfir and to develop the lavi to its full potential means that there was no strategic reason to share what was at the time our * best * combat aircraft . 
  imo , this type of thing reduces the incentive to negotiate a peaceful resolution in the middle east . 
  why negotiate ( and possibly have to make some concessions to make peace ) when you could just send a squadron of f-15s to deal with whatever the issue is ? 
   again , am a bit confused , america bombed hiroshima . 
  is that called ` stooping ' ? 
  i would not say so . 
  not stooping , was for example , not doing to japanese pows what was done to ours . 
  not stooping was not treating the german civilians the way that the germans had treated the civilian populations in the 10 countries they occupied . 
  and not treating north korean civilians the way that they had treated south korean civilians . 
  hiroshima on the other hand was about us having intelligence reports that : - 700,000 japanese troops ( including their imperial japanese naval infantry ) were massing on kyushu ( they knew we intended to land there first ) , and were beginning to distribute pamphlets to the civilian populace telling them to take up arms . 
  even if it had n't turned into a major kamikaze event ( highly unlikely ) , the casualty rate for invasions in wwii was 3:1 . 
  the implication was 2.1 million american casualties . 
  - japan 's unit 731 was developing biological and chemical weapons ( which we apparently knew about ) - japan 's failure to surrender within 90 days of the fall of berlin would lead to a russian invasion ( and possibly a partitioning of conquered territory ( which actually occurred on the korean peninsula , ultimately leading to the korean war ) - japan 's high command responded to the potsdam ultimatum with the declaration `` mokusatsu '' ( which meant `` come and get us '' ) . 
   but america held more ethical values than it 's opponents . 
  well , yes , that certainly is what we like to tell ourselves . 
  but we have to prove it too . 
   the intentions , israel 's enemies are considered radical in western terms . 
  this is no reason to use white phosphorus and cluster munitions instead of commandos and smart-bombs . 
  especially in civilian areas . 
   israel does not use cluster munitions in gaza , repeatedly using cluster munitions in civilian areas in lebanon is n't much different than using them in civilian areas in gaza , as far as international law is concerned . 
  and its especially egregious when we 're talking about a country who also happens to be one of the world leaders in development of precision smart weapons ( meaning that the idf always had the viable option of opting not to use cluster munitions )  israel was and remains the only nation to call enemy targets before being bombed in panama , we * also * notified would be targets . 
  but lets not digress from the point . 
  the law does n't mention who calls whom . 
  it mentions who uses what sort of weapons . 
  and just to be clear on this , i do not support my country employing cluster munitions either . 
  especially not when we have the sort of precision smart-weaponry and special forces units that make indiscriminate violence generally unnecessary . 
  and lastly , while not being a military expert , i 'll say that afaik , cluster munitions are for using against massed targets ( such as tank formations ) , and against radars . 
  enemy infantry hiding in populated areas are sort of the opposite of what cluster bombs are supposed to be used against . 
   israel shall remain america 's greatest ally i really think that the terms should be more conditional in nature , and also that our bilateral relationship should evolve towards a less military dimension . 
  i also think that the entire deal of bibi speaking to our congress to tell us what we were going to do with our foreign policy towards third countries was just arrogant ( and yes , i see the irony of it , because we * certainly * do shit like that with our allies )  during the peak of rocket attacks yeah , i know . 
  imo , its important not to stoop to the enemies ' level of egregious behavior in a conflict . 
  imagine if we 'd have stooped the level of what the japanese or the north koreans were doing . 
   there is little difference between saying israel is committing human rights violations and calling for the extermination of the jews .
