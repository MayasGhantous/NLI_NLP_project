  just because it 's not as extreme , or it 's ` one step ' behind , does n't mean it is n't anti-semitism . 
  it is . 
  so ** that ** is the rhetorical device that your guys employ which makes it that nobody is mad that you country 's army has used white phosphorus as a gas ( a war crime ) , as well as cluster munitions , *** in civilian areas *** ( also a war crime ) ? 
  i wonder if our other allies , such as south korea , or nato member nations could get away with that . 
  man ... we really should be more careful who we sell weapons to . 
  i realize that . 
  i was just responding to the previous guy , who was referring to them as outsiders for some reason . 
  but yes , like you say , everybody concerned has been there for centuries . 
  if i make a law regulating what you can and can not wear ... do you call that freedom ? 
  would you fight and die for that freedom ? 
  this appears to be especially true in the part of europe which was liberated from nazi rule by the communists instead of by us . 
  no ... it 's free speech . 
  it 's okay . 
  i understand that maybe bulgaria just does n't understand how freedoms get undermined . 
  back in the 19th century , when `` separate but equal '' was first emerging , it started as local rednecks trying to make regulations about the race of prostitutes in new orleans . 
  so yes . 
  the collapse of freedom , can begin with 0.00002 % of the population . 
  `` those who would give up essential liberty , to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . '', 
   what if us romanians were to start walking around london or berlin or paris , dressed like this ? 
   then i 'd call it `` muh free speech ''  if you come to live in europe , you should probably read the article . 
  or else get to know your own neighboring country a bit better . 
  the people this law is about are the local turks , pomaks , and gypsies , who have all been there since at least the 1500s . 
  it 's like op is saying it 's the flavor of the week . 
  next week it 'll be back to serbs vs. croats or whatever . 
  and we 'll need to send in peacekeepers to that part of the world again . 
  either than , or bomb them . 
  all because they wan na bullshit us all about some 500-year ethnic tension . 
   blend in or fuck off what do you think the percent of people who actually wear that shit is in bulgaria ? 
  half of 1 % ? 
  even less ? 
  why ? 
  because freedom speech is not really a thing in those 3 countries ? 
  they used to . 
  and that turned out just lovely . 
  what i do n't get is why a group of minorities who 've been around since 500 years is being called `` outsider '' . 
  the article says that the local community consists of turks , roma ( who 've been in the balkans since the 1100s ) , and local pomaks ( had to look them up . 
  apparently they 're slavic muslims whove been there since the 1500s ) . 
  that 's exactly what happened between serbs and all their neighbors . 
  and it ended with us having to bomb milosevic back into the stone age in exchange for randomly deciding to kill half a million of his own people , half of whom he did n't want to count as his own because they make the sign of the cross from left to right instead of right to left !, 
   here is no place for them in a modern society and i am sure many women would be secretly glad they would no longer be required to wear them . 
  that said there really arent almost any women who do wear them , its very very uncommon in bulgaria . 
  that 's how i expected . 
  that 's exactly the way it went down in belgium , france and nl a few years back . 
  they were worn by something like 0.000001 % of the population . 
  and yet somehow this issue became the top issue in the news for weeks in all three countries . 
  why ? 
  because sarkozy needed something to distract the media from the fact that he has ** no clue ** about how to respond to the financial crisis . 
  the belgians and dutch meanwhile ended up having to bail out their entire banking sector , but ended up bumbling the cooperation so badly that it cost the belgian pm his job . 
  and then there was no government for almost 2 years . 
  so ... it was n't really about the dressing habits of 0.000001 % at all !, 
  i understood that milosevic 's popularity was not much different than that either . 
  is this really about europe though ? 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  it 's your problem because it 's your neighborhood . 
  when things go wrong there , europe sees immediate repercussions . 
  just like bosnia and kosovo . 
  that 's the same reason why we 've sent troops to haiti and mexico, 
   it sounds like you 're suggesting it is immigration that got the first world to where it is today , which of course would be utterly ridiculous . 
  while various corners of the internet have got their subjective personal opinions on the matter , i have had a chance to read some of the studies and inquiries on the matter , basically , the consensus seems to be that on average , they do indeed contribute to economic growth . 
  also , how well a country does with refugees , has a lot to do with how institutional well-organized that country is . 
  wb studies say that for uganda , this is a problem , while for the uk , us & canada , this is more of a new benefit . 
  also , as an american , i 'd say that we pretty much owe our entire country to successive waves of immigrants . 
  not only would silicon valley not exist without immigrants , neither would our railroads , nor our industrial revolution . 
  as for the uk , from what i can see , their immigration is more like a direct consequence of the fact that they used to rule a quarter of the planet . 
  things would have turned out differently , if otherwise . 
   actually i have to take that statement back because of the yugoslavian war . 
  another instance where europe failed to cooperate and the us did well . 
   washington 's main concern with europe is that this sort of thing is going to keep happening . 
  libya was like that too . 
  georgia and the ukraine were more sever , in the sense that nobody did anything concrete . 
  neither europe nor us . 
   we definetely should n't get involved in muslim business i do n't agree . 
  muslim or not , it 's still your neighborhood , and you 'll still end up dealing with the consequences of what happens there , whether you want to or not . 
  if the eu had does to isis in 2014 what the french did in 2013 to al-qim in algeria & mali , europe might not be seeing the sorts of repercussions that they currently are . 
  imo , one thing that has been tried , and which should is to make the north african & levant states close to europe into prosperous countries , that can help lend stability to the region , and possibly even absorb some refugees . 
  tunesia could have been turned into a much more stable place , had europe given half a shit . 
  instead of being a jihadi-exporting country with a qatar-backed islamist government who had nothing to do with the arab spring , they could have an eu-backed labor government and a recovering economy  i think the us should pull out of eastern europe . 
  while i think that it would have been better off to see most of eastern europe as neutral territory rather than have them enter nato ... now the die is already cast . 
  pulling out now would embolden putin , while demonstrating to america 's allies that us strategic commitment is fickle & unreliable ( which might lead to serious consequences elsewhere in the world , such as in the asia/pacific region where a lot of our allies are already concerned that we 'd abandon them if china gets sufficiently aggressive in the region ) . 
   we have become complacent but your huuuge military enables that . 
  this is indeed a major headache for washington . 
  we express that to nato on a continuous basis . 
  we keep asking for our allies to commit 2.0 % of their gdp towards defense . 
  and we keep getting stuck defending allies who have 0.8 % of gdp defense budgets , but who still want to provoke putin/ghadaffi/milosevic . 
  or british common law, 
  although we have dropped the ball a few times , i do n't agree with the 3-4 decades idea . 
  we can not be everywhere at once . 
  and these days worrying about both russian and chinese expansionism at the same time as dealing with a generalized war between sunni and shia everywhere the two meet , is occupying a lot of our time and concentration . 
  frankly , it 'd be nice if our allies helped us for a change . 
   amnesty is still running it 's pro-muslim brotherhood/anti-sisi propaganda in full force . 
  sorry , but this sounds like some straight-up tin-foil hat level conspiracy bs . 
  the way i see it , this is about the fact that back 60 years ago , europe knew how to get off its ass when shit hit the fan in their immediate nighborhood . 
  these days , europe has forgotten how to do so . 
  too many years of being lazy , bloated , and comfortable , if you ask me . 
  too many years of being able to call us to come bail you dudes out , instead of solving shit on your own too . 
  kinda like the late roman empire in some ways . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reductio_ad_hitlerum ), 
   every country in this side of the world paid a much higher price than `` one year of economic expansion '' , and the idea that britain would balk at securing their sovereignty because of it , is laughable . 
   that 's kinda how north korea sees south korea too . 
  i 'm gon na guess the deep basement region of `` neckbeard-stan '',
