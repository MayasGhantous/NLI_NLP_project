   poland was a member of the allies from the start of the war and was left out to rot . 
  sad but true . 
  it was n't until 1948 that we stated taking the matter seriously . 
  but also , the reality of the situation on the ground in poland is that the country was already occupied by soviet troops . 
  at least czechoslovakia was jointly liberated by the americans and the soviets . 
  we made it as far as pilzen , if i 'm not mistaken . 
   i was replying to you claiming high and mighty that the u.s installed democracy in europe after ww2 . 
   although i never actually said that , we actually did do that in germany and italy . 
  for the rest , we mostly just prevented the further expansion of communism . 
  what i did say is that the idea that `` democracy prevailed over dictatorship '' is only true for ** some ** parts of europe . 
  but not spain , not the balkans , and not any part of the warsaw pact . 
   it did n't have jack squat to do with eastern europe except for the part where we prevented eastern europe from growing larger . 
   not sure if you 're being sarcastic because that sounds very ignorant and somewhat patronizing , apart from the axis the americans did n't did n't exactly come in and change our values . 
   sorry , i do n't mean to come off as patronizing , but yes , the czechoslovak 1948 elections happened . 
  communists won and stalin called in the president-elect to moscow ( see the cnn documentary series called `` cold war '' ) . 
  the result was that the next european elections in which soviet interference was detected ( 1949 elections in italy ) , saw the us also interfere in that election . 
  there was covert campaign financing . 
  there was a letter-writing campaign by italian americans , and there was an element of soviet agents and their unmarked bundles of cash disappearing into the middle of the night . 
  operation gladio it was called . 
   most of europe was democratic both before and after the war . 
  i 'd say that this depends on which side of the berlin wall we 're talking about . 
  at the very least , you have to admit that east germany and west germany were two different creatures . 
  and that west berlin would not have been part of west germany without the berlin airlift . 
  you just ca n't re-write history like that . 
   not all of europe adopted these virtues through non-violent means , the napoleonic wars were a big factor in this . 
  in the end though , democracy prevailed over dictatorship , there was a hope it 'd do the same in syria , that most people there supported the idea of some sort of secular democracy . 
  well , seen from over here , it was a thing that people realized in the space of time between june 6 1944 , the berlin airlift , and the 1948 elections in czechoslovakia which resulted in that country joining the communist bloc . 
  we decided that we were n't gon na be letting czechoslovakia happen again , and the european electorate pretty much decided which side of the berlin wall they 'd rather be living on . 
  but yeah , i was hoping for the arab spring to lead to the rise of democracy too . 
  but basically a lack of preparation , foreign involvement / financing of islamist movements coming from qatar and the gcc , and the complete indifference of europe to even the best and most successful case , where statebuilding was clearly possible ( tunisia ) , pretty much sealed doomed the arab spring . 
  that said , the french revolution took a loooooong time ( and a bunch of wars ) to yield the kinds of realities that the original people involved were dreaming of . 
  so , this is n't w/o precedent . 
  but the way you describe the situation on the ground , reminds me a lot of what we used to say about the balkans ( which are now , at last starting to look stable-ish ), 
  i guess that you guys should have thought about that when you were debating whether or not to do something about syria . 
  i do recall basically that mafia , corruption , and human trafficking concerns were taken into account when everybody was trying to decide what to do about eastern europe & the balkans . 
  if i recall , not wanting to be over-run with mafia was even one of the reasons for stabilizing kosovo . 
  so why did you guys drop the ball this time around ? 
  it 's not just about immigrants . 
  prior to the syrian civil war , and its resulting wave of refugees , you had some countries in europe which complained about immigrants , but that is n't what can be called `` existential '' . 
  what this is really about is a complete lack of organization and resources to handle crisis in the immediate surrounding neighborhood . 
  it 's as true today with isis as it was yesterday with ghadaffi , or the day before that with milosevic . 
  europe should wake up and smell the coffee today , because while today 's regional threat is isis , tomorrow 's regional threat is called ** putin ** . 
  and his resources are considerably larger & more organized than 2,000 dudes driving improvised jeeps around the syrian ever will be . 
  but also it 's also a complete lack of organization when it comes to dealing with internal matters . 
  the greek crisis demonstrated that very clearly , as did its spread to spain , portugal , cyprus , and iceland , since that part of the crisis was entirely down to lack of organization and institutional competence at the eu level . 
  all the while , both china and the asia/pacific region are getting more and more relevant by the day . 
   the eu is closer to syria then it is to libya . 
   really ? 
  well , i guess that lampedouza might be further away from libya than cyprus is from syria . 
  i have n't measured . 
  but italy ( and neighboring countries ) is already mainland europe . 
  given the size of the countries involved , that might count for something . 
   then i gues we 've different definitions of ` okay ' . 
  unless you forgot about best korea ( north ) . 
  actually , i specifically meant south korea . 
  we have never done any state-building in the north . 
  also , most koreans who live here just call sk `` korea '' , so i got used to saying it that way . 
   the same can be said about china or taiwan , correlation does not imply causation . 
  actually , i think taiwan 's situation is remarkably similar to that of south korea . 
  basically they were colonial regions of the japanese co-prosperity sphere , who became pro-american dictatorships during the cold war . 
  the geopolitics of their situation ( help with money , defense , and institutional building , as well as incentive not to screw it up ) , lead to accelerated industrial & economic growth , and eventually , they became democracies . 
   i 'm not sure , the involvement was probably a mistake , not due to a limited amount of participants . 
  also many countries did n't want to overthrow libya into a caliphate . 
   it could have been something like the war in syria or like the war in the balkans , but much , closer to several eu member nations than syria is . 
  also , the presence of isis there has more to do with libya post-war situaiton being completely and utterly neglected . 
  if anything , it should be in the eu 's national interest to try to make sure that it is surrounded by stable non-crazy , non-hostile countries . 
  also , maybe this is the ` murican in me talking , but i can say that washington is just not comfortable with having a dictator whose state actively backed terrorists . 
  and we are n't that comfortable with our allies being cozy to him either . 
   because that was so succesful in afghanistan and iraq that we thought ` hej , let 's try that again ' . 
  korea worked out pretty okay , considering that it stated out in 1953 being more conservative than the north , and less economically developed than sierra leone . 
  of course , the incentive for not screwing it up in korea was pretty big , given the cold-war context , and the proximity to china and japan . 
  also , european state building which took place in eastern europe & balkans has not been a total failure . 
  so , i think that libya ( and tunisia ) should be seen in that context ) i think that, 
  wow . 
  i 'm so impressed by your eloquent use of your extremely well-though-out logic . 
   it 's cause of your shitty military that ca n't even run a post-war in iraq because you 're too incompetent that caused these problems . 
  yeah , i hear that a lot . 
  the basic point though is that we do take our own near-abroad more seriously . 
  as does any serious world power . 
  you 'll never see us do that in the western hemisphere . 
  but my point still stands . 
  any serious power ( not just europe ) , faces a choice between : - setting aside more resources to deal with things that happen in the near-abroad - learn to live with the consequences of having been too lazy/poor/disorganized to deal with crises in the near-abroad . 
  we helped you out with milosevic . 
  and we might help you out with putin , but with mena , you 're on your own ( unless they discover more oil , of course ) . 
   italy has 2 , spain has 1 , france has 1 , and the uk is building 2 . 
  i had to look that up , and i stand corrected . 
  i recall reading that the spanish had decommisioned the juan carlos as a result of the financial crisis . 
  also , i was n't up to do date about the italian ships . 
   but aircraft carriers are pretty useless for something so close to home base , they 're for power projection far away . 
  i do n't agree . 
  the charles de gualle saw action in the libya intervention , and had to retire due to wear and tear . 
  but , it looks like between mena , the balkans and putin , the european neighborhood will always have some level of action . 
  which might require use carriers if the europeans ever decided not to wait until things become large-scale out of control crises . 
   not even half the eu participated in the libya campaign . 
  which was a mistake . 
  if anything , the intervention in libya was typical european `` too-little-too-late '' . 
  nothing was done until the american decided that they did n't want to see ghadaffi emerge victorious ( the rebels were down to trying to hold benghazi , which ghadaffi 's forces had surrounded ) . 
  after the fighting ended , no effort of state-building was made whatsoever . 
  the result is a civil-war-zone that exports refugees to europe , and jihadis to isis-held territory . 
  it makes a good example of what not to do in terms of responding to crises in the near-abroad .
