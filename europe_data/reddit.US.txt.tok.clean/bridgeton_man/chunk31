   separately since it is an existential crisis for the eu . 
  existential , you say ? 
   now , further taxing european business is only going to make low-paid jobs move abroad and pollute even more . 
  so , what 's the alternative to not having enough resources to deal with issues constantly arising in the european neighborhood then ? 
   having sufficient eu resources does not exclude the italian navy having insufficient resources to maintain a military operation . 
  not when the entire combined eu naval fleet is incapable of dealing with situations like the one in libya for more than 5 weeks . 
  they have 2 carriers between them the 28 member nations . 
  right ? 
  and in a situation where what is really needed is the ability to tell people like ghadaffi , miloseveic , assad , and putin to stfu ** before ** they create refugees by the million , i 'd say that this is both pivotal , and extremely insufficient . 
  as far as coast guards go , i 'll also mention that i used to live in miami , where the us coast guard ( as large and well-funded as it is ) , has generally been able to handle a maximum of around 45,000 refugees ( from haiti , cuba , etc ) , before being overwhelmed in the florida straits . 
  according to the unhcr , the italian navy had to deal with 3 times that number in 2015 , while the eu 's combined forces have to around ** 23 times ** as many refugees , and they have to do it while patrolling an coastline considerably larger than florida 's . 
  even with the cooperation of turkish authorities , it has been argued in the ep that only around one tenth as many personnel as is needed to maintain their end of the turkish deal . 
  even if the parliament was exaggerating the figure ( as parliaments sometimes do ) , the message is clear : even with turkish cooperation , there just do n't seem to be the necessary resources currently available . 
  in order to tackle this issue properly , the eu probably needs something along the lines of a combined command , which has a budget on the size of 2 % of the eu gdp ( which is the current national-level nato recommendation , but the dutch contribution to that is only 0.8 % of gdp at present ) , and is capable of putting a stop to the situation at its source , by putting a stop to the mess in syria in the same way as we did in bosnia , and also securing the libyan coast . 
  anything less than that is purely symbolic , and is n't really going to succeed in addressing the issue at this late stage . 
   there 's no lack of eu resources , do n't tell that to the italian navy . 
  operation mare-nostrum collapsed exactly because of that reason . 
  and , once that collapse lead to the arrival of tens of thousands in italy , then the the french tried to pull this bs line about their border being closed to refugees . 
  i guess that somebody should have passed the french a memo saying that you need more than 150 gendarmes at the border if that 's what you want to try to pull off . 
  especially when - we 're talking about thousands of people who have already decided to risk their lives over this matter , and - the french/italian border is large , mountainous , and easy to hide in , - the italians were already in no mood to cooperate with the french , given the complete french indifference to the collapse of mare nostrum . 
  and renzi said so publicly . 
  nobody is really asking you dudes to straight-up pay more taxes to deal with this syrian refugee issue . 
  what they are asking is to choose between either - setting aside more resources to deal with this crisis - continue being completely unprepared for the million of refugees fleeing syria & iraq . 
  but let 's not kid ourselves here . 
  the total and complete lack of eu resources , coordination , planing , and organization on your part is already blatantly obvious . 
  i for one , am just glad that this time around it 's the consequences of isis aggression and al-assad aggression . 
  if it were ** putin ** - aggression , then ** we ** would be bound by treaty to come and save your lazy-disorganized asses . 
  was this written under the ( factually untrue ) idea that turkey grants asylum to syrians ? 
  that 's what australia is for mate . 
   i believe that true refuges should be helped . 
  but i do n't believe that people have right to violate law because their home is ruined by war . 
  ** does not compute ** either their home was ruined by war ( making them refugees , and bringing the relevant law into play , and basically making the slovaks the criminals ( ** as usual ** ) ) ... or it was not . 
  and it slovakia and hungary do not have legal obligation . 
  one or the other . 
  but not both . 
  conspiracy-grade garbage, 
  which country ? 
  also , imo , the eu is just facing the same kinds of growing pains vis-a-vis lack of economic and institutional coordination that the us faced in its first 100 years . 
  although i remain optimistic that the eu will learn start acting like a damned union faster than we did , at least your great grandchildren will get to expereince an organized and functioning union . 
  i blame the rest of europe , for not standing up to them . 
  why is there a us flag there ? 
   this is not about who can ultimately win some hypothetical war but about politics . 
  the specific term for this , in policy circles , is `` proxy war '', 
   you are off topic man , we are talking about defend spending . 
  all the problems you listed could be solved with integration , but that would cut costs , not increase them . 
   yes , that is a good point . 
  my main thought here is that both a results of the same . 
  the shameless and unmitigated desire to free-ride on defense issues . 
   costs in syria is up to every individual country , but to drop a few bombs here and there wo n't solve a crisis . 
  i agree in full . 
  i just look forward to the moment when europe 's leaders wake up to this . 
   well there is no need for eu to become much more important i do n't agree . 
  there is a cost to being geostrategically insignificant . 
  quadaffi , putin , and erdogan are getting involved in local electoral politics , while people like milosevic try to dictate terms to europe . 
  countries like china and saudi and qatar actually succeed in doing so . 
  hard for the citizens of a country to have decent quality of life in the ling run with shit like this going on . 
   if europe and usa would had stayed away from the middle east or come up with a sensible plan first we would all be much better off . 
  i actually agree here . 
  i was against the iraq war . 
  cheney said it best in his 1994 interview . 
  but that 's a bit besides the point . 
  we went in . 
  shit hit the fan . 
  likewise , i 'm sure that people were telling czar nicolas and emperor fraz-josef that getting into wwi was gon na be a bad idea . 
  but the people 100 years ago dealing with that did n't actually have the option of pretending that they shitty decisions of 1914 did n't happen . 
   why would you need a big budget to deal with syria and libya ? 
  mostly its the logistical and projection costs . 
  everytime nato goes somewhere , america has to pay the airlift costs . 
  the us military airlift command ( mac ) is something that the european allies could replicate if they intend to add value to the alliance . 
  projection , has a lot to do with how much it costs to do airstrikes overseas . 
  in libya , france sent its aircraft carrier . 
  embarrassingly , a few weeks at sea caused the french so much depreciation that the charles de gaulle was going to be confined to port for repairs for *** 2 years *** . 
  the alternative to this is to rely on overseas airbases and/or in-flight refueling . 
  neither of which are without cost . 
   most countries are not even close to syria or libya anyway , they share only borders with other peaceful european nations imo < this european level-lack of coordination is ridiculous and unacceptable . 
  it 's the reason why europe does n't manage to become a major geostrategic player . 
  northern europe saying `` this is southern europe 's problem '' while southern europe says `` this is northern europe 's problem '' is exactly the reason why you guys are weak and pathetic . 
  i happen to work in france near the italian border . 
  when the refugees started coming from libya en masse in 2015 , italy ' nato allies told italy that the ( badly overwhelmed ) italian navy was on its own . 
  and that italy also had responsibility to deal with 100 % of the refugees . 
  the french made some tough-sounding posturing noises about how they were going to not cooperate with italy , that their border could be closed . 
  and patrolled . 
  italy 's response ? 
  `` lol nope ! '', 
  they immediately stopped coordinating & cooperation with france . 
  it took the french exactly two weeks to figure out that you ca n't close a border with tough-sounding words . 
  and you ca n't do it with 4 part-time gendarmes at a train station either . 
  that shit actually requires coordinated resources . 
  and it requires italy 's help . 
  and italy was now saying `` lol . 
  not our problem france . 
  fuck you '' . 
  so ... i 'm not sure how this issue looks from the far-side of the eu . 
  but that 's what it looks like down here on the front lines . 
  you guys are n't part of nato though . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , you guys are neutral towards putin . 
  and you guys also happen to be the part of europe furthest away from the syrian and libyan warzones . 
  not the standard european situation . 
  people who live in southern europe see a different reality . 
  there are the nato guidelines , which request 2 % of gdp to be spent on defense .
