  our other allies ( korea , japan , manage it , but most of our european allies ca n't be bothered . 
   i 'm not interested ok . 
  enjoy the consequences of your inaction then . 
   call me egoistical , no ... the going term in washington is `` free-rider '' . 
  basically you want something-for-nothing . 
   these `` villagers '' are literally traitors says whom ? 
  some guy in an climate controlled office on the other end of europe who wants something-for-nothing . 
  the guy who is unwilling to send troops to deal with the situation at its source ** but ** somehow wishes that isis and assad would magically go away by themselves , and that people would stop running away from them ? 
  were you singing that tune 20 years ago when we were bitch-slapping milosevic for you too ? 
  the way i see it , this whole debate is a lot of lip , plenty of symbolic posturing , and exactly zero french troops in syria . 
  but just like was the case in the balkans 20 years ago , this is realpolitik . 
  ideological posturing wo n't do a thing . 
  only troops will . 
   as for civil war , let me laugh , go ahead and laugh . 
  but please do it in syria , while wearing a blue helmet , and holding a rifle . 
  otherwise , i think you 'd be wasting everybody time here . 
  20 years ago , when it was bosnia and kosovo , we were happy to help out . 
  now we 're kinda busy . 
  china , north korea , and other geo-strategic situations that our `` allies '' give us no help with . 
   refugees have no need to go from italy to france . 
  this is realpolitik . 
  who will stop them ? 
  you ? 
  i actually work in this region . 
  and the first thing i can tell you is that the french seem to be under the impression that somehow by using *** their words *** , they will achieve a damn thing . 
  it makes literally no fucking sense . 
  the border is large and mountainous . 
  italy is already pissed enough with the french that they are totally unwilling to help , and the attitude of the locals is basically `` fuck the police '' . 
  and into the middle of that france goes `` our budget allows us 15 gendarmes for the entire region '' . 
  what did they think was gon na happen ? 
  and for every syrian in the eu , there are 3 more in turkey who could be on their way . 
  that 's what happens when your geo-strategic foreign policy consists mostly of sitting on your ass and free-riding your allies . 
  realpolitik . 
  so , your point of view is that implementing that refugee law that you guys ( democratically ) came up with 60 years ago , in the context of a civil war that you were too lazy to intervene in is somehow treason , despite the fact that doing otherwise would not only be illegal but also require the kind of military and hard-power resources you do not even have , and keep voting not to spend money on ? 
  correct ? 
  traitors to what ? 
  to whom ? 
  i 'm really not sure what us policy is like . 
  i just happen to know that cuban refugees have it pretty ok , due to the cuban adjustment act . 
   we do n't need a navy or borders to stop them . 
  yes , i see that . 
  i live not far from the french/italian border , and i 've seen that tough talk , symbolic posturing , and wishful thinking have definitely worked miracles so far . 
  just like it did in the balkans 20 years ago . 
  as is always the case when there 's a war going on . 
   and did you start voting communism ? 
  of course not . 
  those were just absurd hallucinations of local florida rednecks . 
  probably meth-induced hallucinations . 
  and to be frank , bullshitting about the most recent arrivals is a time-honored american tradition . 
   the issues we 're dealing with are totally alien to the us . 
  you guys attract the liberal-elite of the islamic world . 
  yeah , i 've noticed . 
  but again , none of this symbolic debate really matters . 
  just like in the balkans 20 years ago , or in ukraine 5 years from now , ** does ** matter is whether or not we 've sent troops deal with the dictator and put a stop to the war yet . 
  or whether we 're still in the wishful thinking phase . 
   nobody in the west is going to be sending any peacekeepers to anywhere in the arab world . 
  ok . well ... enjoy the consequences of your inaction then . 
  if you call washington , the mostly answer you 'll get is `` sorry , a bit busy with asia-pacific right now . 
  cheers ! '', 
   your fiasco in iraq has made that politically impossible for generations to come . 
  although i did not support going in there , i have some ideas for sorting it out . 
   and we do n't have to accept these refugees . 
  part of my family came in a wave of cuban refugees that consisted of 44,000 people on rafts . 
  that was enough to ** completely overwhelm ** the us coast guard in the florida straits ( which is an actual naval force ) . 
  that would be about 1/23rd as many refugees as the eu got last years from what i can tell , neither italy , nor france , nor greece has any choice in this matter . 
  because none of those countries actually has a navy . 
  the result of 60 years of free-riding . 
   and we do n't have to accept these refugees . 
  that 's what i meant by you throwing the rules at us it 's true . 
  i ** did ** mention that you guys invented some treaty obligations for yourselves regarding this issue . 
  but , the thing about treaties is that they are subject to the same kind of * realpolitik * that the strategic situation is . 
  could you guys * theoretically * say `` fuck the rules !, 
  ( that we came up with ) '' ? 
  sure . 
  but in this specific case , that would require actual hard-power resources . 
  maybe try again when you 've actually got a navy . 
   i refuse to make a hostile citizenry my fellow democrats . 
  interestingly enough , that 's kinda what the locals said when my family would arrive . 
  the going theory was that it would only be a matter of time before we all started voting for communism . 
  my dad actually sued for defamation over being denied employment on the grounds that he had been a communist ( which is an accusation that arose on the basis of the fact that he spoke fluent russian , and some ukranian ) . 
  i changed my comment when i realized that you were trying to talk about turkey , instead of syria . 
   this latest mideast mess would n't even be there without your meddling yes . 
  i am aware . 
  i did n't support invading iraq in the first place . 
  cheney was right in 1994 , when he predicted what would happen if we went into iraq . 
  but all of that is a bit beside the point . 
  when it comes to it 's near-abroad , ** any country that matters ** , takes the time and effort to make sure that things are in order and to its liking . 
  we do that in the western hemisphere , as per the monroe doctrine . 
  russia does it . 
  china . 
  apparently , even turkey and iran are trying their hand at this lately . 
  the only party not doing it ... is you guys . 
  and , botswana , i guess . 
   and do n't throw the rules at me , incompetents like merkel ignored the dublin rules when she wanted . 
  i 'm not . 
  what i 'm throwing at you is called * realpolitik * . 
  you can either stop free-riding us , and take the geopolitical situation of your own neighborhood more seriously . 
  or else you will be buried by it . 
  you do n't see the russians sitting around with their own thumbs up their asses . 
  or with their heads in the sand .
