   none of your bs will guilt me into accepting a hostile population ... 
  i 'm only here to convince you of one thing . 
  that inaction has consequences . 
  during the 1990s , you guys sent peace-keepers to the balkans ( ok , so they could have been better prepared , and the french leaving them hanging was also unspeakable ) . 
  but this time around , you 're too lazy to even do that !, 
   and : a betrayal of europe . 
  not interested in changing the subject . 
  we 're talking about syrian refugees . 
  right ? 
   with our recent election we just had our muslim diaspora ( who 've been here 50 years ) vote en masse for the party that stands with erdogan * en masse * sounds like a wild exaggeration . 
  how many seats did they get ? 
  it sounds exactly like the guys back in the states saying that we 'll vote * en masse * for this or that . 
  but anyways , you ducked the question . 
  and i 'm not really that interested in changing the subject . 
  betrayal of what ? 
  i 'm an expat , and i only had this kind of arrogance the first 2 years , while having that first high-salary job . 
  betrayal of what ? 
  tough to say . 
  my parents are refugees . 
  as it turned out , fidel castro outlived my dad by about 5 years , and my grandma by way more than that . 
  so ... ya never know . 
  possibly the amish . 
   what ? 
  im from the uk and we meet our spending obligations . 
  and washington applauds that . 
  but even that has n't really been sufficient to get troops on the ground in the european neighborhood where they need to be . 
  i applaud operation serval ( france 's mission to tell al-q to stfu in mali ) , but if there 's insufficient military resources to deal with the syrian situation nato-wide , then this problem will get addressed . 
  but as for north africa , the situation is more complex . 
  you want to negotiate with the libyan gov. 
  right ? 
  would that be the libyan gov that we recognize , but has no actual sovereignty ? 
  or the one that controls some ( but not all ) parts of the coast , but whom we have no contact with , and whose main concern is their own stability , not europe 's ? 
  or isis ( who controls part of the north-african coast ) ? 
   use our troops and navy/airforce 's ** error 404 : military not found ** increase your country 's military resources , stop free-riding our alliance , and try again later . 
   anyway what data do you use ? 
  i am really interested now and would like to look at the numbers . 
  is it anything i could get access to ? 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/gender_pay_gap_statistics ) is the eu data set on the matter . 
  you get sectoral divide , age cohort , and pt/ft divide . 
  all of it on a per-country basis . 
   could this not just be partly that they have a lower human capital due to have grown up in a society that discriminated against them . 
  i am not sure what countries you are talking about though . 
  what if you go back in time and look at the pay gap for 50 years old 10 years back ? 
  that 's a good question . 
  imo , more research is needed . 
  some of the countries are euro-med ( like portugal and cyprus ) , but also finland has this issue . 
  as does switzerland . 
  meanwhile in poland , it 's moreso the other way around . 
   some countries also have different retirement ages for women and men , which should create differences . 
  i do n't know if that is a thing anywhere in the eu/eea . 
  is it a thing in finland ? 
   immigrants from other countries it is a sign the market is working very good . 
  that 's my view on the matter as well . 
   however it can depend on a lot of things . 
  is this because of the differences in costs for hiring women ? 
  for instance in some countries pregnancy can be a huge cost for the company , in other society pays the bill . 
  is this because they like the culture there ? 
  it 's tough to say . 
  it 's definitely the case that for some eu countries the pay gap is largest for women in the 20s or 30s . 
  that would support this idea at a country-specific level . 
  but some countries have larger pay gaps for women in their 60s . 
  so maybe something related to elderly/retirements costs in those countries . 
  but then again , it might be a sign that employers in those 4 countries just hate hiring old women for more superficial reasons . 
  or maybe in those four countries all of the women with high productivity job-skills tend to leave before they turn 50 . 
  the data does n't give enough info to say for sure . 
   about the demand curve . 
  it is aggregate demand , all demand for female and male workers in the whole society . 
  for it to exist two different curves a huge part of employers need to underestimate women . 
  sure the whole society can underestimate women , but that creates a big opportunity for the few that does n't . 
  this might already be the case . 
  recently , germany 's trade minister gave an interview to cnn about trump having made a tirade against the eu being a german colony . 
  his reply was that `` our economic destinies are entwined , because german industry 's supply chains reach deep into eastern and central europe '' . 
  and it 's basically true that a cursory look at the econ of many eastern european countries would demonstrate that the econ is basically dominated by german firms and austrian ( and other western ) banks . 
  the feeling among germany 's business community about the matter is exactly that the `` more modern economic outlook '' of german firms is what allows them to economically dominate the whole region . 
  not sure how much water that view holds , but thats how this issue looks from germany . 
   and one of the primary reasons for that given is always the difference created by women taking maternity leave . 
  imo , there 's no getting away from this general trend in the datas . 
  there 's only like 4 eu countries where the gender pay gap is n't in some way tied to maternity.but , in 4 countries , the pay gap is more severe for women aged 55-65 or 65 + than it is for age 25-35 we could address this by granting both parents parental leave . 
  maybe our kids will be so lucky . 
  who knows . 
   there is an opportunity for companies to hire the cheaper workers if they are cheap because the demand for them is lower , then this is basically a moot point , is the point . 
  but yeah , one thing that happens on the eu level is that there are a few sectors of the economy which have large wage gaps in southern and eastern europe , but not in the more developed parts of the eu ... and that leads to the professional brain drain of educated women in those sectors towards the more developed parts of the eu . 
   i 'm not entirely sure what you want to say , to reiterate , the eu data outlines that the gender wage gap is larger in some sectors than others . 
  and therefore the distribution of the labor force in those sectors , will have an effect on the national-level statistics , mathematically speaking . 
   by `` borat factor '' you mean sexism ? 
  in certain ( more developed ) parts of the eu , there are negative stereotypes about the southern and eastern parts of the eu having a bigotry problem . 
  oddly enough , that stereotype is pushed by stories about those parts of the eu told by educated knowledge migrants from those parts of the eu , living in places like germany and holland . 
  i 've certainly heard corroborating anecdotes by italian and hungarian colleagues . 
  and by my doctor ( who is bulgarian ) . 
  but still ... it 's just a stereotype and a few personal anecdotes . 
  the story they tell only seems to match the data in some places , so i would call such anecdotes an exaggeration which might not be wholly representative of reality at the national level . 
  duly noted, 
   he is describing the fact that companies would compete to hire women if they have a lower wage but are as efficient as men . 
  that would push up the wage until women have the same wage as men , assuming women and men are as productive . 
  to the extent that the gap is not produced by differences in demand , i guess . 
  but if it 's a gap in ** demand curves ** that causes this gap in the first place , then supposing that a laissez-faire approach will lead the demand curves to converge seems a bit `` 101 '' . 
   if companies choose to pay women poorly they will lose them in the eu , this does actually happen at the eu-level and at the sectoral level . 
  in the lr , labor-migration from the less-developed to the more developed parts of the eu is a thing . 
  and this can be ruinous for the less-developed eu nations , because it 's the people who are working professionals in the high-value-added sectors who are most likely to move to places like sweden . 
  since high-value-added sectors tend to have statistically negligible pay gaps in more developed eu countries , but not in slovakia or greece .
