  the main exception to this is in the finance industry , which consistently has a large pay-gap across the 28 member nations . 
  eastern europe , for example is losing a lot of its medical professionals for this reason . 
  and i realize that this is completely anecdotal , but when i lived in nl , my dutch language course was 50 % female medical professionals from less-developed eu countries . 
  although i realize that there was some selection bias , because german and scandinavian speaking students were put in a separate , accelerated class , since their language is closer to dutch . 
   for example this study , u/10ebbor10 posted itt , thanks , i 'll check this study out . 
  although , i have to admit that a source called `` glass door '' might be a bit partisan . 
  in any case , the eu stats indicating that there are really severe difference per sector is really food for thought . 
  it 's true that some sectors are more `` man-heavy '' , while others are more `` woman heavy '' , and that this is a major control fact is this debate . 
  but what i think is weird is that the same sector will have a statistically negligible pay gap in more developed eu countries , like luxembourg , while having really huge pay gaps in less developed eu countries , like slovakia or greece or bulgaria . 
  i know that it might sound a bit belittling , but in the part of europe where i happen to live , this is what you 'd call a `` borat '' factor . 
  regulatory economist here , can you elaborate specifically about what you mean ? 
  i 've still got most of my econ textbooks , and could look up exactly what it is that you mean to refer to . 
  if i were you , i would not be getting uppity , just because [ ** your country ** ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/gender_pay_gap_statistics#gender_pay_gap_levels ) does n't have a statistically significant gender pay gap outside of the business , finance , and real-estate industries . 
  you 've got ta consider that luxembourg is the wealthiest eu country , but other parts of the eu , lag behind your country considerably . 
  in the same way that alabama and mississippi lag behind new york and massachusetts in terms of development . 
  i 'd rather just give you some specific eu-wide country level hard data to chew on . 
  since i 'm guessing that by the tone of this post , you do n't actually live in the eu . 
  or else you have n't been here long enough to get a grasp for the economic realities of this place . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/gender_pay_gap_statistics#gender_pay_gap_levels so , point specifically to the data : 1 . 
  table 2 outlines the pay gap per-sector in each eu member nation . 
  while it is indeed true that ** some ** specific industries ( like the waster-water management sector in slovenia and luxembourg ) , in some country do n't have a pay gap , you ca n't really pretend that there are n't statistics about this being a thing in numerous industries in numerous eu countries . 
  [ ** citation needed ** ] . 
  figure 2 , which is the country-level pay-gap part-time/full-time divide , directly contradicts this claim being true . 
  if it were true , then the pay-gap would consistently be lower for women who work full-time , and this would be consistent for all 28 member nations . 
  but that is n't what the data says . 
  have you got any evidence about the eu labour markets indicating otherwise or something ? 
  looking at table 1 , which is country-level pay-gap per age cohort , this one appears to be legit . 
  for some eu member nations . 
  but not france , finland , portugal , or cyprus . 
  unless women in those countries give birth around age 65 . which would be unusual . 
   it 's kinda of stupid to push this false `` wage gap '' which is exactly why there is hard data about this kind of stuff . 
  at least here in the eu . 
  so that the debate is more about the details rather than about baseless ideological speculation . 
  i understand that other parts of the world just have to rely on opinions , and speculation , because they do n't have the hard data . 
  but that 's not how things work here in the eu . 
  really ? 
  no comment, 
   lol . 
  more fearmongering and cheap retarded populism . 
  that 's how great britain got where it currently is . 
  they 'll get the leadership they deserve . 
   you 're all bloody idiots , the government did n't want brexit to happen , it happened because ** the people ** wanted it to happen . 
  that 's a stretch . 
  especially when considering that the vote share was like 50.01 % , and even that had to be supported by : - `` we 'll do like norway and switzerland , promise ! '', 
  smh . 
  - russian hacking aimed at advance the kremlin 's strategic influence ( according to mi-5 ) . 
   pretty sure the refugee population has nothing to do with miami being an important port city . 
  until you consider the fact that the city like 55 % cuban and 75 % hispanic , that the main economic activity other than tourism is us/lat-am trade , that spanish is the main working language for anybody who does n't work as a janitor , and that all the investment in the city started out as assets being brought in by people fleeing one lat-am dictatorship or another . 
   and the huge refugee population there does have its issues . 
  yep . 
  the movie scarface is all about the most bigoted stereotypes of the 1980s wave of cuban refugees . 
   but you are absolutely right in that cubans cause way fewer problems and fit into floridian cultural pretty well . 
  yeah , this is understandable . 
  florida has been related to cuba in one way or another since the beginning . 
   not the least being the poor schmucks that were there first and welcomed them probably didnt expect they 'd one day be 50 % of the population . 
  nobody expected fidel to live as long as he did . 
  i certainly did not imagine him living to see the 21st century . 
   and then went to college in the northeast and got to experience the wonders of being near a refugee center that took somalis . 
  i went to college in dc , a city that had both a large somali and a large ethiopian community . 
  also went pt to a community college to save on tuition costs . 
  lots of somali & ethiopian classmates there . 
  they seemed ok to me . 
  their food was good , and their chicks were cute . 
  but overall , those 2 communities have been there since the 80s , so they are quite well-established . 
  i also recall that they had a somali community soccer league ( the ohio teams were the teams to beat ) . 
  which i thought was weird , but which originally was copied from the chinese community apparently . 
  i 've seen people say this sort of drivel about the situation in brussels . 
  somehow , europeans have managed to convince themselves that brussels is twice as dangerous the south bronx or central detroit . 
  the op is basically saying `` fuck the sensationalist press , the actual data does not bear out their alarmism '' . 
  which is the same thing i experienced when i lived in brussels . 
  to be fair , this is n't about the recently elected president-dumbass . 
  the previous guy is complaining about the european allies free-riding the nato aliance and basically not being able to even so much as patrol their own near-abroad without us help . 
  not only is this generally the case , but it 's also the case that washington has been complaining about this for at least 10 years , regardless of administration . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wegzaz7lck ) obama bitching about exactly the same thing ( but doing it in a more diplomatic tone ) . 
  to be honest ... 
  this does not surprise me in the least bit . 
  i remember how completely up in arms the / r/european troll-brigade was when this story was circulating . 
  now it seems like the entire damn thing was just straight made up . 
  it 's funny how nobody seems to care anymore . 
   cuba is ~ ~ 145 ~ ~ ** 90 ** miles away from your country , mexico is a direct neighbor of you . 
  cuba and mexico were a case in point . 
  i made it as simple to understand as possible . 
  but if you want to pretend as countires further afied are n't also part of the near-abroad , i would point out that hait & el salvador are further afield . 
  so is colombia . 
  and yet their internal issues also have their effects here . 
  which is why we avoid sticking our heads in the sand over this . 
  do n't get me wrong , you could stick your heads in the sand if you want . 
  but then do n't complain about the consequences of having done so . 
  you guys ignored the balkans , you guys ignored libya , and you guys ignored syria and ukraine . 
  and doing that has its consequences . 
   you can not go in there and then go `` none of our business '' . 
  well , technically , we just did . 
  but to be precise about it , what we 're actually saying is that `` the local-neighborhood consequences of what we did there is not our problem . '', 
   you mean like ... the eu ? 
   yes . 
  you guys have 130 % of our population , and 120 % of our economic resources . 
  and you have your own military industrial complex , in addition to the open-ended approval to buy whatever military hardware you like from us . 
   i honestly ca n't follow your logic . 
  countries that matter in this world , take the time and energy to shape and manage their local near-abroad . 
  so why ca n't you guys ?
