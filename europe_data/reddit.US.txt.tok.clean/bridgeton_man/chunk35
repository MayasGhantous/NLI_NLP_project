  pretending that the civil wars in your immediate neighborhood do n't have any effects , are just an attempt to stick your heads in the sand . 
  back 100 years ago , when mexico was having a civil war , there were people who tried to pretend that their civil war was n't going to affect us either . 
  then villa straight-up attacked the sw united states . 
   not our problem or responsibility if their internal politics and events are having direct repercussions for your internal affairs , and/or undermining the ability of your region to run it 's affairs , that makes it your neighborhood * par excellence . 
  * and if people can * walk * into your country from the warzone , then there 's no point in pretending that it is n't your neighborhood . 
  that goes not just for syria , but also for the balkans , libya , and the ukraine . 
  you guys fail chronically at managing the stability of your near-abroad . 
  compare that not just to us , but also to putin 's russia . 
  or to china for that matter . 
  or even turkey ffs . 
   then why did you talk about freeloading ? 
  because you are free-riding the alliance . 
  and if you guys were actually pulling their weight within the alliance , then we can presume that stability in your immediate near-abroad would not be an area of chronic & consistent failure for you guys . 
   not really . 
  it is n't our `` neighbourhood '' . 
  if their internal politics and events are having direct repercussions for your internal affairs , and/or undermining the ability of your region to run it 's affairs , that makes it your neighborhood * par excellence * . 
  but besides that , ukraine , syria , libya , and the balkans are also subject to the eu 's enp . 
  which means that not only is it your neighborhood in a de-facto sense , it 's also the case that on a de jure level , the eu formally recognizes this as being the reality of the situation . 
  my comparison , we could * pretend * that mexico or el salvador is n't our neighborhood , but if their civil wars have direct effects felt domestically , then no amount of pretending otherwise will change the situation . 
   we have no business there apart from israel . 
  and we have no business with cuba . 
  does that make cuba ** not ** a part of our neighborhood ? 
  not the way kennedy and khrushchev saw it . 
  it 's also not what the 1994 cuban refugee crisis demonstrated . 
  excellent question , imo , what could/should be done with iraq and syria would be a solution based on the dayton peace accords , which ended the war in the balkans . 
  as for ukraine , it 's a bit late now , but the first hint of russian involvement should have been met with a major show of force by nato as a whole , establishing a zone of control in west ukraine , to contain russian expansionism . 
  if they do n't back out immediately , maybe then pump so much investment into the country that east and west ukraine have the sort of economic divergence that east and west germany had 50 years ago . 
  but that 's just my $ .02, 
   haha , because us dealings in the ** middle east ** has created exactly zero refugees ? 
   look , i know that this will sound arrogant , but it is n't our neighborhood . 
  if it were , we 'd take that sort of question into consideration . 
  but it ** is ** your neighborhood . 
  so , why are you guys not doing something about it ? 
  i get that the french can send troops to mali to tell aqim to stfu . 
  but why do what needs to be done in mali , while ignoring syria , ukraine , and so on ? 
  i would like to propose a 2-step solution : 1 . 
  stop free-riding our alliance like a bunch of crack-addicted welfare queens , and build yourselves a god-damned military for fuck 's sake . 
  remember how 25 years ago we flew into the balkans , and told milosevic to stfu ? 
  yeah . 
  the result of that was an end to the people fleeing the balkans , and the eventual graduations of at least two balkan countries to 1st-world status . 
  okay , so i propose that you guys adopt a policy of giving the milosevic treatment to any trouble-spots in your neighborhood ( it 's not our neighborhood , stop asking us for help ) . 
  this means places like syria , libya , and ukraine need to be given a healthy dose of stfu . 
   europe should slow down with the immigration till it can `` digest '' the immigrants ( and their descendants ) that are already here . 
   ** error 404 : military not found ** please stop free-riding the nato alliance , and/or pretending that you have security forces that you do not . 
  increase military resources and try again later . 
  yes . 
  good . 
  free speech for me . 
  not for you . 
  we are all equal . 
  but some are more equal than others . 
  comparing the 1st chart and the 2nd chart , i 'd say that chart 2 is presenting the same data as chart 1 on a per-country basis . 
  with that said , two key things to notice here : 1 . 
  for roughly 3/4ths of the countries in chart 2 , we 're talking about a + / - 5 % or smaller difference . 
  which is small enough not tbe statistically significant . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://www.ceps.eu/sites/default/files/fig1_second%20generation%20immigrants.jpg ) chart , most of the data in chart 1 ( the total eu level ) , is drawing from 2 countries : uk and france , where the difference is 1.6 % and 3.7 % respectively . 
  this means that the data is heavily weighted by those two countries . 
  extreme outliers like belgium and bulgaria are extremely small compared to the total eu sample size . 
   how do you know ** they 're ** not a man ? 
  because there 's only one . 
  yeah , but there 's only one dyke in the picture, 
  ** error 404 ** navy not found . 
  increase your country 's military resources , stop free-riding our alliance , and try again . 
  this middle ground of yours is a giant lol . 
  the reason that the eu needs to even deal with the turks is the same reason why you guys can not manage a decent neighborhood policy or border . 
  you guys have almost no miliatry and security forces whatsoever . 
  your entire foreign policy consists of free-riding you allies . 
  to top it off the situation in the med demonstrates that you guys also have no ability to coordinate resources whatsoever . 
  that 's why you ca n't manage the med . 
  that 's why you ca n't manage syria . 
  and that 's why you have to ask for allies . 
  we ca n't be bothered to send our 1 milion men at arms . 
  so you 've asked the turks . 
  despite having a smaller , poorer nation than the eu , they can manage larger , and more well-prepared military forces , supported by domestic arms suppliers . 
  pathetic when you think about it . 
   immigration disguised as asylum seeking has been going on in europe for quite some time to a varying degree yeah ... isis & assad going on a beheading-and-bombing-spree across syria and iraq , while belgium and her european allies do nothing about it whatsoever will tend to have that effect . 
   i am not proud of german politicians offering immigrants false hope for a future in germany i do n't they actually did that as much as they admitted to themselves : * `` whlep , guess a million people are walking into out country , and neither we , nor our smaller , tougher-talking neighbors has any real power to do anything about it * '', 
   that 's how europeans did it , right ? 
  we built our nations by abandoning our homes , going to more successful nations , and settling there instead . 
   considering that 1 in 3 americans is a german-american , and that 1 in 5 is an irish-american , that is pretty literally how american was built . 
  except for the railroads . 
  that part was built by the chinese who abandoned their homes , going to more successful nations , and settling there instead . 
  was the country not doing well back in those days ? 
   not my job to be giving you the links to my own comments . 
   fine . 
  but none of these are anythign other than a weak attempt to change the subject . 
  we ask you for solutions . 
  you scratch your vag and change the subject . 
  nothing gets solved . 
   people of german descent betraying their country nobody here is interested in changing the subject though . 
  have you got any solutions to propose to the issue , such as it exists , or not ? 
  my point is that most eu countries have ' t got the hard-power resources to match any such level of rhetoric . 
  they can talk the talk . 
  but they ca n't walk the walk . 
  so why pretend ? 
  to be fair , there 's also footage of obama making public statement to that effect . 
  and the cato institute ( a dc-based think tank ) also has published to that effect . 
  in washington , european free-riding of the alliance is actually a commonly-expressed frustration . 
  trump is just the most recent and most-brash about expressing that frustration . 
  but do n't think that a clinton presidency would have had a different pov on the trans-atlantic free-riding problem .
