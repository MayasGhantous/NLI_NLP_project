  no , it 's his cousin , the `` i 'm annoyed at european free-riding of the nato alliance '' troll . 
  yes , i realize that finland is not a nato member , but their hard-power resources are even more pathetic than those of the average nato member . 
  so the meme is still relevant . 
   can you easily deport them ? 
  it depends . 
  how many ships , plains , and officers does finland have ? 
  my guess is that with 4 canoes and a speedboat , , 8 paper airplanes , and 32 officers in the country , they 're going to have a hard time . 
  you keep saying that you said so . 
  but i looked through the thread seeing if you talk about extra security , or sending troops to syria , or anything relevant whatsoever , so , perhaps , instead of either claiming that you proposed a solution , or feebly attempting to change the subject , you can perhaps tell us all what that solution is because otherwise , just sounds like you 're asking for somebody to buy you some vagasil for that itchy vag or something ,  fully assimilating - i.e. 
  changing their names and fully embracing only local identity , the way that the germans or polish did 100 years ago also , fact-check : the german-americans did n't assimilate . 
  the actively collaborated with germany during wwi . 
  the change in subject indicates that you have n't actually got any solutions to propose . 
  only an itchy vagina to bitch about . 
  please get back to us when you 've got concrete solutions . 
  also , you might wan na apply some yeast-infection creme for the itchy vag . 
   they used refugee flows , and impersonated refugees , to gain re entry to europe after fighting in syri it 's a good thing that turkish intelligence managed to warn both belgium and the netherlands in advance , right after catching and deporting one of them on suspicions of being a jihadist . 
  i 'm sure that the belgians took that seriously , as they always take national security seriously . 
  right ? 
  cuban-american here . 
  we came fleeing communism , and when we arrived in florida , we had plenty of local southern bigots calling us communists . 
  some people are just too dumb to tell the difference between perp . 
  and victim . 
  we eventually sued . 
  a lot . 
  the way i see it , they 've lived soft lives . 
  and soft lives lead to soft , dumb people . 
  it takes hard times to give rise to hard , clever people . 
  to be fair though , your 's is pretty much the only european allied country who actually has a military and security forces . 
  the rest of europe mostly just free-rides our alliance so hard that they have n't bothered to develop the resources to do anything other than accept the situation as it arises . 
  i especially get a good laugh when i see hungarian or czech redditors saying `` sink their boats '' ( thoe guys do n't have navies ) . 
  and i 've heard jokes to the effect that le pen actually has a plan to solve europe 's problems . 
  that she 's got a plan for the economic crisis , and another for the syrian civil war . 
  i laughed so hard that i nearly split a lung . 
  something about 6 million people getting killed that last time a foreign occupying power had access to such statistics , may have had an effect on how france , and other european countries keep statistics . 
  just saying . 
   kudos for you for doing it though . 
  i respect that . 
  thanks man . 
  the way i see it , it was a labor of love . 
  i started learning the languages as a way of saying `` i love this place '' . 
  when i first came here , i did n't expect to develop feelings for it . 
  but damn , it 's just such a decent country . 
  if only they 'd learn to brew beer properly . 
  now that i 'm domiciled in be , i make it a point to use the nl accent . 
  it 's my way of saying `` we may speak the same language , but my cultural loyalty lies with orange . 
  no matter how good the beer is '' . 
   even our national motto `` je maintaindrai '' or however the fuck its spelled is in french . 
  same is true for the uk . 
   if anything , we have to thank it to ourselves that our language is not popular abroad . 
  the fact that its a very hard language doesnt make it easier either if it were up to me , i 'd use a scheme similar to the flemish `` huis van het nederalands '' , to establish a series of schools abroad . 
  college grads with a newly minted diploma would jump at the chance to spend a year working abroad . 
  it 'd be aimed at rich countries ( who have money to spend on cultural trends ) , and who have at least some historic connection to nl or be ( usa , uk , japan , sweden/norway , germany , russia ) ) , and it 'd be linked to attempts to promote dutch culture abroad . 
  and i 'd try to get both countries to share the expenses . 
  would that be before or after the russians pour millions of euros and thousands of hours of hacking into the political process ? 
   jesus fucking christ this is exhausting . 
  read people !, 
  read . 
  yeah how strange to expect a foreigner working and living here for years , decades , to learn dutch right ? 
  expat based in benelux and france here , this is actually a tricky question . 
  basically , the problem is that `` speaks dutch '' is highly subjective . 
  my dutch is at b2 level , and the dutch tend to ask me what region of the netherlands i 'm from when they talk to me . 
  but the belgians have straight-up told me in job interviews things like `` you do n't speak dutch '' , and `` this job requires abn , not amsterdam-dialect '' . 
  they do the same with french . 
  the result is that i do all of my business in france and holland , while the belgians use the language barrier as a poorly-improvised protectionist regime . 
  imo , the belgians kinda need it . 
  they 're way less organized & productive than either the french or the dutch . 
   we are fully aware the dutch language is not a useful language to learn when not living here , the dutch language is general not taught abroad anywhere . 
  i blame the dutch for this . 
  i 'd like it if the language were at least as accessible as italian or hebrew . 
  i have met plenty of people stateside , and some in germany who 'd like to learn dutch . 
  but holland has no equivalent to the alliance francaise so , it goes un-learned . 
   not another emotional plead from a journalist , we need sober factual assessment of the migration from the islamic world and its profound consequences ok : 1 . 
  all of this can be traced to the laziness and reluctance of our euopean allies to actually engage the threat where it lives . 
  this pattern can also be observed in the european laziness in dealing with the situation in the former yugoslavia 20 years ago , and the extreme european cowardice in dealing with the ongoing situation in the ukraine . 
  the longer al-bagdadi and isis keep living , the more that their attacks on europe will continue . 
  and still you do nothing . 
  is it cowardice ? 
  is it laziness ? 
  is it an over-focus on free-riding the alliance instead of actually contributing to it ? 
  a mix of all three ? 
  hard to say for sure . 
  you guys have left the syrian situation fester for so long , that it has created over 1 million refugees . 
  despite a lot of symbolic and tough-sounding rehtoric , the sad simple fact is that the european allies ** do not have the force ** or the hard-power assets to do anything whatsoever about the refuges crisis . 
  people talk about `` allowing '' refugees into europe . 
  they kinda miss the fact that when 1 million people want to do somehing , the combines dutch , belgian , czech and greek militaries are powerless to do fuck all . 
  the belgian navy has 14 vessels in it . 
  what the fuck is that supposed to do ? 
  as a result of european powerlessness , they 've actually had to come to the turks , hat-in hand to ask for turkish cooperation with the issue ( turkey actually has substantial security assets , but they do n't really have much incentive to cooperate ) . 
  europe is avoiding asking the tough question : `` why are we so damned weak ? '', 
  and they 're so desperate to avoid this that they 'll change the subject to virtually anything else . 
  it might be prudent to go and fix it , now that you guys have broken it . 
  yes , i realized that we helped you break it . 
  but the consequences are yours more than ours . 
  you can use all of the cash that you guys are n't contributing to nato , and put it towards that . 
  and in the future , please stop free-riding our alliance . 
   do i need to go on ? 
  you could try . 
  i mean , i ** do ** currently live at the french/italian border . 
  the local story reported in the local press is : - the italians have too few resources at sea . 
  - the french have no resources at sea .
