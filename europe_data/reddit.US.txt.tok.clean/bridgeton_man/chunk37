  - the french try to close the border , but they just do n't have sufficient people . 
  for that . 
  not even close . 
  - last year the french tried to say `` this is an italian problem '' . 
  italy responded by ceasing all cooperation with france on the refugee issue for a time . 
  - the border has a maritime component , a coastal component , and an alpine mountain component . 
  easy to hide in , and move by night . 
  - and neither country has decided to send troops to libya ( the primary transit country ) yet . 
  since the libyans basically do n't give a fuck , this whole thing is just going to continue . 
  so , yeah . 
  you are wrong . 
  neither the french , nor the italians has any idea what to do . 
  nor do they have the resources to make anything more than symbolic gestures . 
  and the italians demonstrably have no patience for french tough-talking . 
  i 'm sure that 'll work out well . 
   greece is already choke full of migrants , so it has nothing to do with greek navy even if your insane comparison methodology was functional . 
  and they can not progress from there , because of 6 . 
  so , so then the whole theater moves to italy . 
  and that 'd be somehow different because ... . ? 
   so you just seriously compared number of combat ships to number of people . 
  actually i counted all vessels in the greek navy . 
  it 's true that if you wanted to count specific ships actually suited to the role in question , the number would be less than 40 . making this an even bigger joke . 
  but i was trying to be nice . 
  anyways , it 's a case in point . 
  the scale of the syrian-refugee thing is large enough that the same sort of math is being repeated in various places across the eu . 
  i happen to be near the french/italian border , and it 's exactly the same deal . 
  too few italian ships . 
  the italian pm made a public statement to that effect in 2015 . 
  then the french closed their side of the border . 
  so ... they are trying to patrol a large mountainous border with like 20 gendarmes . 
  it sounds like a joke ( because it is ) but that 's all that france can afford right now . 
   and greece has no ground path through shengen states to rest of eu . 
  nobody cares though . 
  between greece and slovenia there are mostly tiny & poor states who talk tough , but have ** even fewer ** resources than the greeks . 
  hearing them talk tough ... . is kind of a joke . 
  just to picture how much of a joke it is , i 'll just say that if i were fleeing [ this ] ( http://images.christianpost.com/full/80931/isis.jpg ) , and had already decided to take some risks , [ this ] ( https://cdn4.img.sputniknews.com/images/102504/67/1025046755.jpg ) and [ this ] ( https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1458060/hungarian-camerawoman.jpg?w=736&amp;h=442&amp;l=50&amp;t=40&amp;q=80 ) ai n't gon na cause me to turn around and go back . 
  ( source : my family decided to take some risks when the decided that communism was n't good enough for them ), 
   basic math . 
  you are off by several orders of magnitude . 
   of course it was an exaggeration . 
  but , this actually made me curious . 
  so ... - [ the greek navy costs of 30,000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hellenic_navy ) personnel . 
  and 40 ships . 
  - unhcr reports that last year , [ 856,723 ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=83 ) refugees entered the eu via greece . 
  - that 's 21,418 refugees for every single ship in the greek navy . 
  if we assume 200 refugees per boat , it makes 4,283 boats per greek vessel throughout 2015 . 
  ( and this is under the unrealistic assumption that 100 % of greek ships are at sea 100 % of the time ) . 
  and that 's if the geek navy manages to effectively patrol the whole agean sea . 
  assuming that none of the greek ships are made of cardboard . 
  - this number of refugees is also ** 19.4 times larger ** than the number of cuban refugees that overwhelmed the us coast guard 's ability to react at all whatsoever in 1994 in the florida straits . 
  ( i was living in fl at the time ) . 
  and the us coast-guard is n't a cardboard fleet consisting for 40 ( possibly obsolete ) vessels . 
  so , the point still stands . 
  40 boats , possibly made of cardboard , is not much of an obstacle to 850k people who are fleeing ** actual scary shit ** going on in syria . 
  40 boats just is n't gon na cut it . 
  maybe they should ask all those tough-talking eu allies to send help . 
  maybe hungary and slovakia can send their navies to help . 
   the question that is left is of the political will or , maybe , building ** more ** than 40 boats ? 
  or hey ... this might be totally crazy , but maybe applying the same solution that we applied to milosevic when he acted up , could also work now in syria ? 
  do you think that the though-talking hungarian & slovak military might be able to help out with that ? 
   war and extermination of the invaders . 
  ** error 404 . 
  military not found . 
   are you saying italy doesnt have a navy ? 
  or that it has a bad navy ? 
  i 'm saying that italy 's navy is completely insufficient for the scale of the crisis at hand , at this late stage in the situation . 
  i 'm saying that the italians knew this back when there was still time to choose a different course of action . 
  but by now , the size and preparedness of the italian navy are so completely insufficient for the job , it 's down-right cartoonish . 
  it depends what you want to do with them . 
  the russians are doing just fine with the admiral kuznetzov atm . 
  but yeah , the eu 's combined gdp is like 120 % that of the us . 
  let 's not pretend that you have n't got the resources . 
  it 's more that you would rather spend those resources subsidizing tasty beer and fine wine , while free-riding our alliance . 
  it works well . 
  until it does ` t. 
   it matters as there 's an ethical case to help refugees that 's assuming that you actually have some power over the situation . 
  when you guys are being outnumbered 10,000 : 1 by people who have already decided to risk their lives , you have no power over the situation . 
  by refusing to deal with the syrian civil war when it was in its infancy , ** and ** by free-riding our security umbrella instead of actually spending the cash to develop the necessary security forces to do anything whatsoever , you guys have effectively abdicated any power whatsoever to control the situation . 
  all you guys can really achieve now , with the few resources you have is to complain like bitches , and occasionally make a symbolic gesture , which will not actually effect the reality on the ground . 
  ** [ the weak suffer what they must ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melian_dialogue ) **  the weak in target states no ... much like in the original greek epic , it 's ** the states involved ** who are weak . 
  if this would happen in our neighborhood , or in putin 's neighborhood , it 'd be different . 
  ** [ the weak suffer what they must ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melian_dialogue ) **, 
  possibly . 
  here 's what i know : - in 1994 , when i lived in miami , an uprising in havana not too different than the arab spring , lead to 44,000 refugees coming to florida in rafts . 
  this number of people was sufficient to completely overwhelm the us coast guard in the florida staits . 
  - the number of refugees entering europe last year via the italian route was ** three times ** this number . 
  in 2016 , the share of the refugees coming via the italian route is even higher . 
  - i 'm not sure how many vessels the so-called `` italian navy '' has in the med . 
  but it 's probably too few to do anything on more than just a symbolic level . 
  and half of those ships are probably made of cardboard . 
  - the number of italian troops in libya ( the main transit county ) . 
  is ** zero ** . 
   italian navy lol . 
  the italian navy ? 
  lol . 
  what 's that ? 
   that is why it 's better to not get involved with african/middle eastern problems . 
  how is that strategy of not getting involved in syria 's problems working out for you guys ? 
  is it working out better or worse ( in terms of raw numbers of refugees ) , than when we all went into the former yugoslavia , guns blazing ? 
  it kinda does matter .
