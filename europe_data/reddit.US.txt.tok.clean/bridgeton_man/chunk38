  there are 1.01 million of them ( just in 2015 ) , and the combined security forces between them and germany are probably only 175 poorly trained/poorly equipped personnel , who are way , way less scary than the shit they are running away from . 
  in a context like that , what you call them literally does not matter . 
  they are here . 
  ** the weak suffer what they must . 
  not very clear ( are you high or something ? ) . 
  the only part of that which made any sense , or was even grammatically correct was the first sentence . 
  so i 'll respond to that . 
   you are talking about consequences . 
  yep . 
  the chain of consequences works like this : 1 . 
  a civil war erupts within walking distance of the eu . 
  the eu ignores it . 
  the eu also spends 20 years cutting back on its navies , armies , and security forces . 
  1 million people flee the civil war that europe ignored by just walking their asses over there , and the security forces & coast guard that europe does n't have are powerless to do anything about it . 
  because insufficient resources/personnel/funding / fuel/munitions/ect . 
  instead of fixing points 2 and 3 , the entire political spectrum of europe does nothing but whine and complain like effeminate little bitches . 
  but never actually comes up with a plan to fix points 2 and 3 . 
  make sense ? 
  sorry , none of what you just wrote makes any sense whatsoever . 
  maybe you meant to reply to somebody else ? 
  my point is that europe spent years choosing to do nothing . 
  and that doing nothing has consequences . 
  that 's as true for countries as it is for individuals . 
  for the rest , i think you might want to save the ideology for whoever the intended target of this diatribe actually was supposed to be . 
   if you are so desperate to make these places better , do so at source . 
  is this an endorsement for finally doing something about the syrian civil war . 
  or is it more like an endorsement of the idea that you guys ** should have ** done something about that civil war ** before ** the war created 3-5 million refugees ? 
   do n't import the problems here . 
  this is a false solution . 
  the simple fact of the matter is that 2015 decisively demonstrated that the refugees are coming . 
  by the millions and that the eu just does n't have the resources to do anything about it whatsoever . 
  ( 1.01 million entered the eu lat year , and there are another 2 million in turkey right now ) . 
  lazy inaction has its consequences . 
  ignoring the near-abroad has its consequences . 
  if europe learns nothing else from the syrian civil war , then at least learn this . 
  okay . 
  ** truth : ** this is the consequence of you guys ignoring the near-abroad and also ignoring defense & security issues for years . 
  this is what the consequences of lazy inaction look like . 
  most half-decent world powers would never ignore their near-abroad . 
  that 's why both us and the russians have sent troops into the near-abroad everytime things turn out not to our liking there . 
  it really is n't relevant if they 're right or wrong . 
  what ** is ** relevant is that you europeans were too weak/lazy/cowardly / effeminate to do anything about syria before millions of refugees from there started showing up in europe . 
  now you have consequences . 
  as far as credibility goes , i still have n't seen le pen or wilders say `` and that 's why we should be sending troops into syria '' or `` and that 's why we need to stop free riding the americans and actually establish navies consisting of more than 13 ships . '', 
  sure ... they can follow in the european tradition of whining like effeminate bitches . 
  but there are still no troops on the ground , no boats at sea , and no european presence in the transit countries . 
  and no serious plans to establish any either . 
  ** error 404 : military not found ** please increase military spending , stop free-riding our alliance , and try again later . 
  meh ... that 'd be the equivalent of saying that steve jobs was n't american . 
  to be fair , *** you *** might fly the english flag , but most redditors who whine and bitch about this issue tend to fly the fly of countries who have literally no military or hard-power means to do anything about this whatsoever . 
  you can tell by counting the number of troops said countries are able to send into the respective conflict zones and also the number of ships said countries manage to put in the aegean & med . 
  not sure how exactly this is newsworthy . 
   we do n't have many recent muslim migrants as you maybe heard . 
  and our less recent are not vocal so i can not relate to them . 
  i used to live in prague , and there i met their community ( i got hired as an english teacher by a mosque there . 
  they wanted their congregation to have professional skills . 
  and they paid handsomely ) . 
  the community consists mostly of german-turk expats who work for german firms , and french-speaking arabs ( i guess from france or north africa ) , who mostly have married czech wives and have czech kids . 
  mostly they just complained about how ** !, 
  @ # $ % ** cold prague was . 
  which even the russians were doing that year . 
   do i get it right that you imply that lefists want migrating muslims to drop their heritage and follow lefists pov ? 
  yes , pretty much . 
  and it 's not just leftists . 
  that was also pretty much the foreign policy of the bush administration towards the middle east ( since it 's already the case that us-born arabs/persians/turks are already way more assimilated that what i read about in europe . 
  and are stereotyped as being shamelessly capitalistic ) . 
   could you elaborate on that ? 
  i 'll see what sources i can find . 
  but the fastest case-in-point to mention would be sadiq khan , the current [ mayor of london ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sadiq_khan ) , who was a lawyer specializing in employment and discrimination law before getting involved with the labour party . 
  since then he has been all about lower housing prices , and about public transit . 
  and he self-describes as a feminist . 
  while i 'm no expert on uk politics , that all sounds pretty left-ish to me . 
   progresives use to ignore opinion of christians on that issue . 
  they seems to be more receptive to muslims wishes . 
  i do n't really think so . 
  if anything , they 're mostly looking for who are the voices of change from within that community . 
  that 's the way it works in the us , uk , and canada . 
  not sure how it works in poland . 
  what if anything does your views on islam have to do with this news ? 
  it seems to my like there would not be much economy left in poland if you guys were to do that . 
  one is a consequence of the other , though, 
  if there were polish peacekeepers stationed in one of the relevant conflict zones , or if the polish navy were in the med at the moment , i 'd see where you are coming from . 
  otherwise , it seems like you are just complaining about the fact that wars in neighboring countries happen . 
  complaining . 
  but not actually doing anything to address the issue . 
   yeah , containing iran 's influence by setting up a perpetual civil war in a country friendly to them . 
  good job . 
  you 're surely the heros we should rally around . 
  i 'm not saying it went well . 
  i 'm saying that we had concrete reasons for getting involved . 
  but then again , trying to explain this to somebody from a country who does n't even take it 's national security seriously might be a lost cause . 
   except most ee countries including us sent soldiers who fought , helped the locals and died in afgh , iraq , balkans , mali and wherever . 
  which includes the stupid mena wars that created this chaos in the first place . 
  although i 'll admit to not having having read anything about ee nations contributing to the [ mission in mali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval ) , the rest of it sounds like an open admission that you guys straight-up failed in keeping the situation secure and under control everywhere else you 've been . 
  maybe if you guys tried harder not to fail ? 
   but i agree , we should suck as much money out of eu before it goes to shit https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/welfare_queen, 
   i do n't say its not necessary . 
  right , but do you or any of your neighbors ** act ** as if it were necessary ? 
  as a member of nato , czechs took part in kfor , sent their forces to afghanistan as a part of isaf , were involved in iraq , and host a u.s. 
  interests section in damascus .
