   right , but none of those things sound like `` we 've got the syria situation under control ''  pointless bloody wars what do you mean ? 
  ** our ** neighborhood is secure . 
  if you think that sounds pointless , then i guess that 'd explain how you guys are in the situation that you are . 
  which is about 4 years too late to be relevant for the syria situation . 
  speaking of which , how many polish boots are on the ground there ? 
  how many polish ships are in the med ? 
  is the answer zero ( again ) ? 
   you americanos shoulda just stayed the fuck away from syria and let the rebels get crushed we had concrete reasons for being interested in containing iran 's influence . 
  and in containing isis . 
   we would n't have this crisis then . 
  lol . 
  doubtful . 
  the eu 's failure to keep its neighborhood secure is not syria-specific . 
  it 's true for the balkans , the black sea region , the baltic region , libya , and ukraine as well . 
   the lack of unified plan or anticipation is a eu-wide issue yes , the security-failure in the european near-abroad has been an eu-wide failure . 
  so is the defense-related free-riding . 
  but that means that everybody is gon na see the consequences of this in one way or another . 
   syria is no nato operation . 
  read the fucking treaty . 
  that 's fine . 
  it 's your near-abroad . 
  so whatever happens there tends to create more trouble for you guys than for us . 
  i 'd just imagine that you would have been less careless about mis-managing your regional security issues . 
   refugee crisis is your fuck up . 
  it 's your neighborhood though . 
  which is why you get the consequences of it . 
   leave us alone . 
  lol . 
  good luck with that . . 
   cmon you cant attribute this solely to the ce-4 . 
  while that is a fair point , the european allies neglect of their own region 's stability certainly did create a turd-sandwich . 
  but , now , the question is who ends up having to take a bite of the turd . 
  ( hint : all of you )  they have far bigger issues than bigger issues than national security ? 
  really ? 
   last time czech ( slovakia ) spent 15 % gdp on military budget , the western values were forced on us through munich agreement and all the military gear did end in the hands of nazis . 
  not taking your geopolitical position seriously has its consequences . 
  just like today . 
   contribute to nato for once ? 
  you 're ignorance would be hilarious if it was n't doused in arrogance . 
  we are one of the few nations that actually uphold our nato obligation for expenditure . 
  [ ** wrong ** ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/02/daily-chart-11 )  and nah , we wo n't leave , we will continue to benefit ... https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/welfare_queen, 
   is it worth to risk the whole european project for an endless amount of refugees from africa and the middle east ? 
  the best way to express that sentiment is to express it while standing in syria wearing a rifle and a blue helmet . 
  you borats chose to free-ride both the nato alliance and the eu , while contributing exactly zero peacekeepers to the conflict zones . 
  i 'm not sure why they are surprised to learn that laziness has consequences . 
  how will you fund it though ? 
  how will you defend yourselves militarily ? 
  no ... it 'll remind the borats that laziness has consequences . 
  maybe the 'll remember that the ** next time ** some stupid conflict breaks out in their own backyard . 
   i do n't get it let me give you the memo then : 1 . 
  * you guys ignored a conflict in your own neighborhood * 2 . 
  * laziness has consequences *, 
  i see it as the consequences of having ignored the situation in the near-abroad until it turned into a full-blown crisis . 
  that , and lot 's of eastern-european free-riding . 
  it will solve problems in the long run because the next time that there 's a conflict in the european neighborhood , you wo n't be such pussies about dealing with it , when you remember that laziness has consequences . 
  you do n't get to pick which warzones make refugees , though . 
  unless you are prepared to send troops there ( you are n't ) . 
  not really that relevant . 
  the eu is trying to make itself relevant on the world stage . 
  if that means that slovakia , hungary , and borat-stan have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century , then so be it . 
  it was the same with our own states of alabama and mississippi . 
   what 's the point of distribution if there are thousands more coming every week ? 
   right , but they do n't wan na admit that they are too weak ( or cowardly ) to send sufficient troops to put a stop to the conflict . 
  the reality of the matter is that they should have done something about the conflict before it created 1 million + refugees . 
  but , since they chose instead to see the refugees . 
  not sure why they did n't think this through better . 
  it would have made more sense to keep the syria situation under control . 
  but i guess you guys were too busy free-riding our alliance to take that seriously . 
  enjoy your consequences . 
  there are other ways , but the ce-4 already decided that they 'd rather free-ride nato and the eu instead of putting boots on the ground ** before ** the syria situation got out of hand . 
   this will create more anti-eu sentiment across europe . 
  my hope is that it 'll create the sentiment that free-riding the alliance instead of dealing with your won damn european neighborhood was really stupid . 
   there are elections coming right now here . 
  what does junker expect czechia to do ? 
  our population is already as eurosceptic as it gets and the refugee crysis made everything even worse . 
  seen from washington , it seems like the best course of action would be either : 1 . 
  stop fucking free-riding and help solve the syria problem . 
  contribute to nato for once in your fucking lives . 
  and the eu while you are at it . 
  sftu already and accept that not doing anything productive has consequences . 
  gtfo . 
  i think that the west is right to draw a line in the sand over this . 
  i 'd like to see just how far the euro/nato/west skepticism goes, 
  seen from washington , it seems like the best course of action would be either : 1 . 
  stop fucking free-riding and help solve the syria problem . 
  contribute to nato for once in your fucking lives . 
  and the eu while you are at it . 
  sftu and accept that not doing anything productive has consequences . 
  leave . 
  i think that the west is right to draw a line in the sand over this . 
  not sure how you would even enforce this . 
  not sure how you would even enforce this . 
  do the not have terrorist attacks in those countries ? 
  the way i see it , sweden does n't free-ride nato and they do n't free-ride the eu . 
  it makes sense that they would not want others free-riding the eu either . 
   even to many redditors they will stay ee . 
  instead of jumping boat people should work to improve the image of ee . 
  what kinds of improvement did you have in mind ? 
   only estonia hits the required 2 % out of the baltic nations . 
  singlular , not plural .
