  yes , fair enough . 
  i might be a bit stereotypical in that i ` ma bit fuzzy when it comes to the smaller , more remote eastern-european countries . 
   poland which are not baltic nations well , i hope that poland is actually putting those men to good use then . 
  last i checked , there is no polish naval presence in the med or in the aegean sea , and there are no polish troops in any of the conflict regions where al-queda , isis , or assad are busy generating refugees by the hundreds of thousands . 
  which would , in effect make the polish armed forces even less relevant than those of *** france *** . 
  while i 'm not sure what your source was about turkey , the [ world bank has them at 2.1 % ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs ) of gdp . 
  but , in principle , it would be weird if a country the size of germany had a million men in its military , was a major buyer of american arms , and has at least some involvement in iraq & syria and got that done for cheaper than 2 % of its gdp . 
  nice try though . 
  i hate to put it this way , the vast majority of the nato allies are free-riders to the alliance . 
  but the turks , are n't . 
  other than them , the non-free-riders are basically the uk and the baltic nations . 
  so , unless you are british or estonian , you should consider stfu-ing . 
  to be fair , the baltic states are pretty damned strategic . 
  so , we 've got shitloads of troops there . 
  and one of the four non-free-riders is a baltic country . 
  those 892 might disagree . 
  that 's fine . 
  we all have our opinions . 
  but the facts are that only 4 nato countries are non-free-riders to the alliance , in budgetary terms . 
  and that can be felt when we see zero nato ships in thee south china sea , zero nato peacekeepers in the warzones which are sending europe refugees , and zero nato troops at other strategic points of geostrategic interest , such as the korean dmz . 
  true , they may have some ships in the med , and in the aegean , but the number pales in comparison to the scale of the geopolitical situation . 
  and ... that 's why the eu has had to come to turkey for help with this matter . 
  because turkey has the military resources , and the eu does n't . 
  if you ask me , it 's a shame that this is how far the free-riding has come . 
  i 'd rather that european nato not have to ask for help to secure its own immediate near abroad . 
  but , that is the reality we live in . 
  says the small free-riding nations who do not actually contribute to the military security of the alliance ? 
  the way i see eastern europe has no real say in this . 
  i would just send all heads of state a copy of the melian dialogue . 
  for the most part , there are countries who have no troops on the ground in the conflict zones , no boats the med ( or the aegean ) , and whose economies are propped up by eu tax monies and nato 's security umbrella . 
  does that sound like sovereignty to you ? 
  you need to actually have some involvement before you get to have some say in the mater . 
  since i pay taxes in belgium , france , and america , my feeling on this one is not that different than trump 's . 
  if all you do is cost me money , then why should we protect you or help you in any way ? 
  agreed . 
  we 're still dealing with the consequences of our decision to use the `` guns blazing '' approach with iraq . 
  the countries who are shouting the loudest about this , tend to be the ones who have got zero involvement in the conflict zone , and either no navy whatsoever , or no naval involvement in the aegean & med . 
  meanwhile , the parties with the means and backbone to do something , have a more common-sense approach to this , focusing on trying to deal with the conflict zone itself . 
  haters gon na hate . 
  facebook is ' t old enough to have a lot of case law around it yet . 
  i 've been living here a while already . 
  i 'm pretty used to jokes about how american culture involves everybody suing everybody else non-stop . 
  but either way , the idea is that there has to be some kind of mechanism . 
  either the state can do it , or the people will do it . 
  but either way , there 's really no pretending otherwise on this . 
  not w/o people getting hurt anyways . 
  a better way to do it would be to use the us common-law model . 
  the law might not define hate speech , but that wont stop the offended party from suing you , your friends , and anybody you has ever smiled at you into bankruptcy . 
  it might be messy but the eventual reality is that the state can either evolve some mechanism to deal with it , or the people will deal with it themselves . 
  and i for one think it 's unfair to run around pretending as if italy even has a navy in any but the most symbolic sense . 
   help them fix their shit back home . 
  this is exactly what europe 's leaders keep deciding not to do . 
  with predictable consequences , might i add . 
  last i checked , our european allies have n't done anything substantive in the international arena since bosnia . 
  and that was 20 years ago . 
  ** edit : ** france sending troops to deal with al-queda in mali is one notable exception in which the europeans actually decided to get off their free-riding asses and put their neighborhood in order . 
  what i do n't get is what that is n't taken by europe as a lesson in how to do things . 
  ** error 404 : military not found ** please increase spending , stop free-riding the alliance , and try again later . 
  also , develop your own damn capacities of action . 
  ** are ** they handling it though ? 
  or are they just gon na play pretend ? 
  yeah well , the thing is that they 're a country ( just barely ) whose military security is wholly dependent on free riding nato 's military security umbrella ( which costs me tax money ) , while their economic stability is wholly dependent on being europe 's biggest welfare queen ( which also consts me money , since i work in europe ) . 
  somehow , they manage to cost more than greece does . 
  incidentally , both of these free-rides are actually conditional on being a democracy . 
  meanwhile , their president is politically viable because of his ties to the kremlin . 
  at no point does hungary or any of its elected officials manage to stand on their own two feet . 
  imo , if we want to see them get their shit together , the most efficient way would be to cut them off , wholesale . 
  that way , they 'll either get the shit sorted out , or they 'll become part of russia 's empire ( again ) . 
  but since their real added value is basically zero , either of those outcomes is fine for me . 
  right , but the real question is whether that one issue of of hating that other people have freedom is sufficient to vote for some kind of [ foreign-baked useful idiot ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/useful_idiot ), 
  you 're afraid of * being called names * by your political adversaries ? 
  is that it ? 
  if you want to talk about your country actually backing anybody whatsoever , or doing anything whatsoever in the international arena , you might want to switch from a bulgarian flag to a russian one . 
  because last i checked , most of the eu countries ( especially the eastern ones ) have made no attempt at foreign policy of any kind whatsoever since the fall of milosevic . 
  ** error 404 : military not found ** insufficient resources for this operation . 
  increase military resources , stop free-riding the military alliance , and try again later . 
  i believe the phrase you are looking for would be [ `` useful idiot '' ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/useful_idiot ), 
   the problem is exactly that the us `` does something about it '' . 
  you may act all tough and jingoistic , but your brainless dickwaving ** in iraq ** without any coherent plan . . 
  exactly . 
  iraq . 
  but not our own immediate near-abroad . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'd say that invading iraq was retarded and basically going to lead to a civil war . 
  dick cheney even said so in a 1994 interview . 
  but what does any of this have to do with not ignoring the events of your own immediate neighborhood ? 
   and now you 're telling us that we 're at fault for those horrible terror attacks ? 
  bin laden is dead ( he attacked us ) . 
  al baghdadi is still alive ( he attacked you ) . 
  last i checked no european leaders have yet developed any plans to deal with that fact . 
  instead , there 's just a lot of domestic vagina-scratching about who can wear burkas or whatever . 
  as if that mattered in any way to the geopolitical situation . 
   your only direct neighbors are canada and mexico . 
  that 's it . 
  near-abroad are parts of the world where their internal domestic events have an immediate effect on our domestic events . 
  sorry , but if you think that the near-abroad is limited to the countries that share a land-border with the us , you 'd have to openly admit that you 've *** never even heard of *** the monroe doctrine , the cuban missile crisis , the panama canal , pablo escobar , lucky luciano , nazi submarines using caribbean bases , the mexican civil war , or the entire nations of haiti and el salvador , whose internal situations had direct consequences for the us . 
  but judging by your user name , i see that you 've t least heard of shakespeare and might have read hamlet . 
  so , that 's a start . 
  maybe it only demonstrates that your education is only 500-years out of date . 
   or if you think that iraq , syria , iran , libya etc are somehow comparable to ... 
  the main thing being that haiti 's political instability was a major source of refugees ( and that lots of them die at sea , leaving corpses that wash up on florida 's tourists beaches ) .
