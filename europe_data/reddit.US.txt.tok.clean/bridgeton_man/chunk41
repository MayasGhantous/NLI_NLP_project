  that 's why we sent troops there . 
  which have since been replaced by a un mission ( that we authorized ) . 
  it 's really not that difficult to understand , with even just a basic smattering of geopolitical logic . 
  if some country is within raft-distance , then you might want to make sure that it does n't become a major source of refugees . 
   the only even remotely credible threat to usa from usa 's neighborhood in the last 100 years was cuba , and even that only happened because ussr put its nukes there cuba is an interesting specific case , even aside from the cuban missile crisis . 
  the fact that castro also sent enough refugees in 1980 and again in 1994 to completely overwhelm the us coast guard at sea is also relevant . 
  as was the question of whether cuban was acting as a transit country for drug cartels in the same way that panama was . 
  and then there was that time that nazi subs were using bases in the caribbean , meaning that the navy needed airbases in the caribbean to launch air-patrols looking for nazi subs . 
  then there was the period that the italian mafia was using the island as a base of operations for the us ( if you 've ever even heard of myer lansky or lucky luciano , which from the looks of things , you probably have n't ) . 
  next question . 
   it 's taking us so long because it 's a problem that the us created we did not create assad . 
  but if assad lived in our neighborhood , we 've have dealt with him  basically the destruction of the iraqi state was the trigger for all this shit and spain was n't involved in that . 
  amiright ? 
  lol . 
  the main difference is that when things go wrong in our neighborhood , we ** do something ** about it . 
  that 's why there are troops in haiti , and us involvement in central america and agreements in with cuba and mexico . 
  and when there was a civil war in mexico , we sent troops there , too . 
  meanwhile , your main reaction to the wars in your neighborhood , tends to be [ ** this ** ] ( https://thumb9.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/608860/608860,1281620717,2/stock-vector-the-ostrich-has-buried-a-head-in-sand-58909777.jpg ) that 's why you have militants from the war in syria shooting up paris with guns left over from the war in yugoslavia . 
  we did not create assad . 
  but if assad lived in our neighborhood , we 've have dealt with him . 
  same goes for isis . 
  not sure what 's taking you guys so long . 
  to be fair , none of europe 's leaders have yet to come up with a plan for dealing with the people creating the refugees in the first place . 
  from washington , it looks like europe 's whole plan for dealing with isis and assad is the usual free-riding `` let 's wait for america to handle it '' ( as if we were n't busy with north korea right now ) . 
  our anti-terror plans killed bin laden . 
  when will you 's kill al-baghdadi ? 
  let me guess . 
  to lazy/cowards to do anything about isis , despite their attacks in paris/brussels , ect . 
  amitight ? 
  fat lol . 
  lol . 
  that she is :p, 
   the fact that molenbeek exists in the first place , that there was and is such a ridiculous hive of islamists and jihadists where the cultural norms of belgium and europe are openly flouted and people live like they 're in the third world country ? 
  the trouble is that while in most 1st world countries , the fact that the local people in the neighborhood spend 10 years informing the police that a local terrorist cell is forming , and converting & recruiting local belgians would actually lead to some investigations and arrests . 
  but not in belgium , apparently . 
  this is inexcusable . 
  locals in the neighborhood ** risk their lives ** by informing . 
  if i knew that belgian doughnut-eating security forces would respond sitting on their fat asses and cracking open another box of doughnuts , i would have second thought about informing on dangerous criminals who might kill me if they found out i was snitching . 
   the fault of diversity and mena immigrants 100 % . 
  this completely ignores the fact that lots the first jihadis that were publicly detected were ethnic flemish and and converts of other-eu ethnicity ( i.e. 
  portuguese , for some reason ) . 
  the european media likes to ignore this aspect of it ( as in `` we can do no wrong '' ) . 
  but flemish jihadis have been interviewed on cnn , while the uk press has interviewed the families of wallonian jihadists . 
  to me , the belgian media pretending that there are n't belgians involved in this , is just a farce on the same scale as when the ukrainians and poles attempt to pretend that they did n't participate in the holocaust . 
  it makes a warm , fuzzy feel-good story . 
  but it 's ultimately a lie . 
  a lie that will get people killed . 
  it also completely ignores the fact that the mena community spent 10 years informing , and saw no action taken until around 2014 . 
  maybe if they had carved the message onto the inside of boxes of doughnuts , they might have had more success . 
  who knows . 
  that 's a cute daydream , but this is n't a video game . 
  it 's not rise of nations . 
  it takes for than 30 second for italy to spawn a lager , better-equipped navy or for france to spawn well trained security forces in the sort of numbers that it takes to patrol the mountainous border region filled with villagers whose main cultural attitude is `` fuck the police '' . 
  and even then , all sides would be less motivated than the guys who 've risked their lives to get this far already . 
  and nobody is far-sighted enough to deal with the libyan side , who might be persuaded to care . 
  maybe . 
  if they do n't have their own shit to deal with . 
  as i said , being a keyboard warrior from an air-conditioned office 1000 miles away is one thing , but down on the front lines of this , it looks totally different . 
   and have active deportation program extreme lol dude . 
  do you have the capacity ? 
  planes and ships cost money ( which do n't have ) . 
  where do you send them ? 
  do you even have treaties with countries willing to accept them ? 
  the relevant region of libya is n't even recognized by the eu . 
  and most migrants are n't even from there . 
  like i said , it 's not a video game . 
  it 's way more complex than that . 
  and the europeans basically have no resources to do much about it . 
   i 'm not trying to shift blame . 
  i 'm trying to explain why we happen to be the worst of the bunch . 
  it 's not the explanation but it does contribute to a lot of malfunction . 
  it 's not just the language , we differ politically . 
  flanders shifts to the right and walloon shifts left and it 's going to get worse . 
   yes , i know . 
  all countries have fault lines like this . 
  netherlands ( where i also used to live ) historically had a catholic-protestant divide , which did tear the country apart in 1830 . 
  but besides that , i feel that the dutch have managed to put aside their differences and manage their affairs ( esp . 
  their economic affairs ) , w/o descending into the narcissism of minor differences . 
  imo , part of the difference is in the electoral model . 
  belgium has literally got an electoral model which leads to each side looking to blame the other side in a cheap bid to get more voters . 
  belgium is supposed to be a catholic country . 
  i say that whoever came up with that incentive system should be declared a heretic and burned at the stake . 
   i 'm voting for the end of belgium as we know it . 
  the economist in me sees nothing good in this . 
  belgium 's econ , such as it is , depends on access to the english channel , and immediate proximity to the german & french industrial heartlands , as well as human capital resources that can work professionally in multiple languages . 
  any undermining of this for short-term political reasons is going to undermine the econ . 
  also , the demographic trends are extremely alarming . 
  a huge chunk of the work-force is in the middle of retiring , and dealing with this is the no . 
  1 threat to the belgian econ ( according to the 2009 arbeisdmarkt beliedsnota ) . 
  apparently , the solution has to do with managing the labor-market mismatch . 
  and also clamping down on employers who want to discriminate older workers . 
  the american tax payer in me also sees nothing good in the end of belgium . 
  our european allies are free-riding the security umbrella that america provides . 
  they are n't pulling their weight within nato . 
  having nato consist of more , smaller countries who would be even less brave about sending troops into their local conflict zones is going to cost ** me ** more money , on a personal level . 
  i really believe that our allies need to stop free-riding , and start pulling their weight . 
   btw , watch the noise-regulation drama unfold involving brussels airport and watch belgium shoot itself in the foot once again because of the regions this is a nimby problem is n't it ? 
  everybody wants to have the major international airport , but nobody wants to live on its flight path . 
  back home the dc area , with its 3 jurisdictions , ( dc/md/va ) , has the exact same issue . 
  last i checked , the brussels metropolitan is all about trying to develop bxl and its immediate suburbs in one , increasingly coherent whole .
