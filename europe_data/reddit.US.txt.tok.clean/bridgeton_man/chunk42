  the commercial districts of diegem and zaventem are being developed , as are better transit links between the airport and the bxl city center . 
  and in a way , this needs to happen . 
  the fact of the matter is that the city is out-growing the borders that were drawn on the map for it decades ago . 
  the capitalist in me says that it 's going to keep growing . 
  it 's just a question of how that gets managed . 
  i dunno , that 's just my $ .02 about the whole thing, 
  sigh ... see , ** this ** is what 's wrong . 
  instead of admitting that you guys fucked up by not taking either turkish intel our your own people seriously when you needed to , you bring up the stupid language line as if that were somehow relevant . 
  as if the swiss or the canadians would have fucked things up this badly . 
  was the turkish report about ibrahim al bakhroui written in flemish or something ? 
  did the serbian guns left over from the last war that europe ignored get smuggled in by people who used french to evade capture only to be used in the paris attack ? 
  when isis attacked belgium 's jewish museum ( in my neighborhood ) , in 2014 , did the fact that the police were flemish-speaking play any role in the fact that they were too cowardly to show up until they found out that didier reynders was on scene ? 
  because the french police managed it as soon as the gunman was in their jurisdiction . 
  turns out that they 'd been following him the whole time . 
  was the fact that belgium 's arabs speak arabic relevant when it turns out that belgium 's doughnut-eater patrol ignored 10-years worth of reports that sharia4belgium was trying to convert and recruit belgian teenagers and send them to make jihad ? 
  lol . 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  blaming other people for your own shortcomings is just another form of laziness . 
  and you are n't fooling anybody except yourselves . 
  also , please stop free-riding our military alliance . 
  the fact that your military forces have a median age over 36 and that your participation in the danger zones is almost nil , is just pathetic . 
  and while you 're at it , please finish repairing your supreme court building . 
  or are the delays in the repairs somehow a consequences of the language divide too ? 
   before talking like that about our `` national spirit '' and reducing everything to psychological factors ( collective lazyness ) , please consider that your own country started the whole mess in the middle east and that maybe maybe , but that 's a different story . 
  i admit that fighting the `` war on terror '' by invading iraq instead of anywhere relevant was dumb , and that even dick cheeny was of that opinion ( he gave an interview in 1994 to that effect ) . 
  only 58 % of the electorate actually supported going in in the first place . 
  but , that 's not what i 'm talking about here . 
  you guys ** consistently ** mismanage your internal security situation . 
  the actual nature of the danger is pretty irrelevant when belgium 's doughnut-eating security forces will respond by going on holiday and doing nothing , no matter what . 
   dont ever forget : is was created in iraqi prisons during the time americans were there because of wmds that were never found . 
  to be more specific , i 'd say that the idea of disbanding the army and handing the country over to a regime who mainly just wanted to put sunnis in jail was probably what did it , more than any other factor . 
  i 'm also not gon na refrain from being critical of my own country in this . 
  on that , we can agree . 
   if we chose to we could just choose to block immigration that 's what the french thought , when they tried to close the italian border to migrants coming in on the libya to italy route . 
  it turns that that in order to do this , france needs to have more that just 2 sleepy cops on the job ( so ... insufficient french resources ) . 
  it also turns out that italy was unwilling cooperate because the french were unwilling to help the italian navy in the med to handle the situation ( insufficient italian resources ) and neither country had any presence on the ground in the region of libya where the refugees were coming from . 
  i spent 2015 living in the border region watching both sides fail miserably at this . 
  it 's great that keyboard warriors in the uk or finland can come on reddit and bs about this from their air-conditioned office 1000 miles away from the action , but down there on the front lines , the real consequences of having insufficient resources and no presence at the source of the problem feel completely different . 
  personally , i do n't really think that sucking putin 's dick for money is a good way to fight terrorism . 
  or run a country for that matter . 
  the conflict zone is not at the eu border though . 
  the eu does not share a border with the places where the conflicts are actually happening . 
   but `` protect '' should mean we prevent people from entering ok . three problems here 1 . 
  the czech army ( aside from almost not existing ) is much less scary than isis . 
  and the guys fleeing from isis will act accordingly . 
  it 'd be much easier/cheaper to go kill isis . 
  one of the main things needed is a functioning navy . 
  aside from almost not having an army , your country actually does n't have a navy . 
  so how are you going to deal with the rampant lack of resources to patrol the med ? 
  or the aegean ? 
  dealing with the problem somewhere other than the source of the problem does n't solve shit . 
  it 'll just cost more money and lead to some diversionary tactics . 
  but if you really want , you can try , i suppose . 
  once you develop the resources to pretend to try , that is . 
  we tried that in panama . 
  like other commentors are saying here , any country that ever mattered , cared about about its near-abroad . 
  sure , you can stick your head in the sand on this one , but realistically , your options are 1 . 
  keep order in your near-abroad 2 . 
  deal with the effects in your country of having ignored the situation in the near abroad . 
  if jihadis return from syria run through your country 's capital with smuggled aks that were left-over from the balkan conflict , that 's just the consequences of your country having chosen option 2 multiple times . 
  if shitloads of syrian & iraqi kurds show up on rafts in quantities that outnumber your country 's navy by a ratio of 60 : 1 , thats also just the consequences of your country having chosen option 2 that 's why america tends to chose option 1 . 
  enjoy !, 
  you actually need a military for that . 
  do n't you ? 
  i mean , i guess it 's easy to talk a tough game , but last i checked , your country has got no peacekeepers in the conflict zones which are generating the refugees , and no navy in the med ( or navy whatsoever , for that matter ) . 
  the refugee situation is going to get settled by tough talking . 
  it 's going to get settled when you guys get off your lazy asses and kill isis & tell assad to stfu . 
  so stop procrastinating already . 
   but there is a certain type of migrant that should be avoided and hungary and other central/eastern states should not repeat our mistakes . 
  last i checked , their trains do n't run on time either . 
  their bureaucracy and security forces are even lazier than the belgian ones . 
  and that 's really saying something . 
  being from dc and having lived in bxl , my first-hand sense is that molenbeek exists as an expression of institutionalized belgian laziness . 
  the idea that the local arabs in brussels and antwerp would spend *** over ten years *** informing that sharia4belgium might be up to something , and that belgium 's security officials responded by sitting on their fat asses eating doughnuts instead of doing ... anything is just beyond me . 
  same goes for the official turkish-intelligence warning about ibrahim al bakhroui getting arrested in turkey while trying to enter syria almost a full year before he blew himself up . 
  make no mistake . 
  molenbeek is the result of the same national spirit which makes the trains systematically run 2 hours behind schedule . 
   belgium did let all these people in and the consequences are our own fault . 
  i agree . 
  much like all our other free-riding european allies , the number of troops they sent to the refugee-generating small wars in their near abroad was too-damned small . 
  at the same time , their ability to coordinate with each-other at sea has been laughable . 
  and the amount that they gave a shit about the arab spring happening on their immediate border was also too-damned small . 
  did you guys think that team-america was gon na parachute in and save the day like we did when milosevic was out of control ? 
  sorry ... busy with the south china sea and the korean peninsula right now . 
   although i suspect it 's driven by an attempt to say `` fuck you '' to turkey , not by aspiration for justice . 
  i see it that way too . 
   i sense some deported butthurt german from cz in your ancestry . 
  guess again . 
  i do not have any german or czech ancestry . 
  i 'm just a guy who has traveled the world enough to 2nd-guess some of the countries whom we consider democratic allies . 
   there were no polish concentration camps . 
  a lot of the guys whom we stripped of us citizenship and then deported for having worked in polish concentration camps claimed this . 
  most of them eventually died in israeli or eastern-bloc prisons . 
  ivan demjanjuk , was just a case in point . 
  he worked at two of them . 
  but at least he did manage to narrowly avoid the death penalty in israel . 
  so ... the czech line is `` it was all german doings ? '', 
  that 's exactly what the poles , austrians , ukrainians , estonians , and latvians said too . 
  we 've revoked the us citizenship of a lot of poles , latvians and ukrainians who participated in the concentration camps . 
  the czechs have been given a free ride on this one ... so far .
