  it 's one thing that you guys can not manage to make your trains run on time , or manage the security situation in your own near-abroad ... but this sort of thing , should taken at least a little more seriously . 
  i 'm just saying that if you want to compare your policy to what israel is doing , then you should first take note of the fact that they actually have the resources and the hard-power to do what they are doing . 
   in case you didnt notice : we are still granting iraqis asylum today , a decade after we liberated them . 
   yes , but how many peace-keepers have you guys got over there ? 
  it 's more a feeling of frustration with how badly you dudes are getting it wrong . 
  i 've been living in europe for 8 years now , and watch this is kinda like watching the 3 stooges . 
  except that there are 28 of you . 
  and i ca n't change the channel . 
   you can basically see the coast you 're heading to still more dangerous than crossing a river . 
   that assumes these people are from syria yeah . 
  it kinda does . 
  or iraqi . 
  let 's [ ** fact-check ** that ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php ) using the official figures . 
   i notice none of them try for israel . 
  well , israel is n't accepting refugees from this specific conflict . 
  also ... they have this thing called hard power , that europe pretty much does n't have . 
  which is part of why you guys are in the current situation in the first place . 
  we did it in yugoslavia . 
  also , it 's worth saying that things have only gotten this bad b/c everybody more or less ignored that conflict for its first 3 years . 
  which was pretty clearly a mistake , as we can see today . 
  thanks !, 
   the greek psyche is wonderful . 
  you mean the canadian psyche ? 
  in his defense , it is n't his fault that europe is in such a weak power-position that they need to work with turkey instead of sending forces into syria to put a stop to the nonsense properly . 
  putin on the other hand ... ... 
  the only real way to do this is to close down the syrian conflict, 
  in 2013 , the french went to mali and did something about the al-queda caliphate . 
  europe could have handled it that way . 
  in the 1990s , there was a civil war going on the former yugoslavia . 
  nato handled it by sending in peace-keepers to support the dayton accords , and also by telling milosevic to stfu . 
  to publicly admit a complete lack of any hard-power whatsoever , and then have to work with the militarily stronger strategic ally ? 
  no ... . . that sounds pretty much exactly like european values to me ,, 
  seems to me that these refugees have already risked their lives to get that far . 
  crossing the med was probably much scarier than crossing a stupid river . 
  because he has nothing better to do ? 
  imo , that is something that you guys should have thought about , when you were busy deciding to do nothing whatsoever about the syrian crisis . 
  everybody knows that wars create refugees . 
  and they always have . 
  so , well , enjoy the consequences of your inaction . 
   what happened to `` they are n't really syrians '' ? 
   my guess is that the unhcr live statgistical map which was repeatedly posted around here probably sank that talking-point . 
  i 'd rather just go by the unhcr figures . 
   so you are against all the us invasions in the middle east , yet you accuse european nations of not sending ~ ~ armed ~ ~ peace-keeping forces to syria . 
  that is correct . 
  i do indeed fee that us involvement in iraq in 2003 was a mistake . 
  ** however ** it ** is ** pretty important for pretty much any world power to do what it can in order to manage crises in its near-abroad . 
  unless of course , the country in question is prepared to accept the consequences of its inaction in the face of its local near-abroad issues . 
  interesting theory . 
  under the current laws , that is indeed the case . 
  i spent last summer near the franco-italian border , where the french applied similar arguments to italy vis-a-vis the refugees entering via the italian route . 
  the italians did n't think very highly of france 's position , so after trying ( and failing ) to negotiate some sort of solution , the italians just opened the border and let everybody through . 
  neededless to say , france did n't really have enough gendarmes to patrol their side of the rather extensive and mountainous border . 
  so , in the end , the reality of the situation dictated things a bit differently . 
  imo , the scale of this issue basically means that europe 's only real option here is to coordinate a multi-pronged response to the whole thing . 
  i 've never heard of a fence that can keep out 1.01 million people who are so afraid of getting beheaded that they 're willing to risk their lives to get away from it . 
  have you ? 
  my claim is n't so much about the de-jure situation as much as the de-facto situation . 
  the simple fact of the matter is that the war in syria is sending syrians ( and iraqis ) into lots of countries in the neighborhood . 
  what your specific country 's legal obligations are in this are probably secondary to the fact that 1.01 million refugees have entered europe in 2015 ( and another 2.4 million or so are sitting in turkey plus another 1.2 in lebanon ) ... and the theoretical situation on paper is probably not as relevant as the reality of the situation on the ground . 
  just because i have the passport does not mean that i wholeheartedly endorsed the various mis-adventures we 've had over the years . 
  i mean ... did all canadians support harper ? 
  or even justin beiber for that matter ? 
  that 's alright . 
  i realize that the marketplace of ideas can be a harsh mistress . 
   slovakia has agreed to take some assyrians that are being hunted to extinction by isil . 
  the obama administration wo n't even admit the systematic eradication of syrian christians and yadizis constitutes genocide ( his lawyers are looking into it though and have been for a few years now ) . 
  was n't that obama 's specific rationale for beginning to take action against isis in the first place ? 
  interesting theory . 
  all i can say is that if i 've already take the decision to risk my life to put as much space as possible between myself , and the syrian conflict ... i do n't think that and extra few croatian or slovak border guards would mean anything to me . 
  no matter how tough they try to look , they 'd probably still scare me less than isis does . 
   you make it out as if it 's either syria or europe for these people . 
  that 's pretty much turkey 's policy on that . 
   in fact , they could stay in turkey , turkey does n't recognize their refugee status . 
  so while there are a lot of syrian refugees living there ( according to unhcr ) , they do n't actually have the legal right to live there . 
   nah , this is n't about running from isis . 
  they were safe from isis and the likes the minute they left war zones of syria and iraq . 
  yeah . 
  i keep hearing that . 
  while it is true that most of the syrian war refugees happen to live in turkey and lebanon , it 's also pretty true that turkish law does n't really grant them the right to stay as refugees . 
  so if i was fleeing the war , and the first country i fled told me that there was a * remote possibility * of being sent back to the war zone . 
  i 'd keep fleeing . 
  which is kinda what we are seeing . 
  as for who is spearheading what , i 'll just say that i basically believe in the ** hard power ** of this situation . 
  sitting around and making summits is meaningless . 
  so are stupid symbolic fences . 
  they probably mean nothing to people who have already taken the decision to risk their lives over this . 
  figuring out a way to tell isis and assad to stfu on the other hand ... . . 
   they 're not running away from something lol . 
  if you say so . 
  so , would you say that the massive spike in the numbers of people coming to europe is just completely coicidental with the fact that there is a civil war in syria ? 
  but , on the other hand , i 've never risked my life ( or that of my kids ) in order to get free stuff . 
  have you ? 
  yep . 
  war create refugees . 
  it 's a sad , simple fact . 
  you guys should have thought about that when you were all busy deciding not to do anything whatsoever about the syrian crisis . 
  how many peacekeepers has slovakia sent to syria ? 
  i think that would require for the macedonians to somehow be scarier than the type of shit that the syrians have already risked their lives to attempt to get away from . 
  otherwise , this wo n't be more than a symbolic exercise in futility . 
   meh ... look at the greece / macedonia border - there is barely a 20km stretch of relatively flat terrain .
