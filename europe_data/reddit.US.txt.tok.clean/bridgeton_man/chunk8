  lol . 
  unless the numbers of people involved are so damn overwhelming that authorities are completely powerless to do anything whatsoever . 
   they are bringing more migrants do you mean by funding isis ? 
  or by not shutting down the syrian civil war ? 
   austria can do what they want , it \u00b4 s their country and their decision who they let in and how many nah . 
  it seems to me that they are actually pretty powerless to actually control how many people get in . 
  they would probably arrest the fist 4000 or so , but then after that next 150000 could probably just walk in and overwhelm any serious attempts to do anything whatsoever . 
   the point stands though , leaving the eu does not solve home grown terrorism true that . 
  it reminds me of a meme i once saw that said : q : what 's worse than syrian immigrants in france ? 
  a : french immigrants in syria, 
  was n't one of them jamaican ? 
   terrorist threat on europe , millions of migrants banging at the door , in my view , it 's pretty clear that both of these problems are being caused directly by syria . 
  and the situation going on there . 
  europe really need to take decisive action on this . 
  making europeans less free is not helping . 
  in fact , it 's basically what the terrorists want . 
   ever-increasing regulations and norms suffocating small businesses . 
  when was it ever not that way in europe ? 
  if anything , official sources ( like wef or the conomic freedom institute ) , seem to suggest that this issue is actually getting less severe going forward . 
  how do you say `` fuck yeah '' in german ? 
   let their co-ethnics and religious brethren take them in . 
   [ you mean countries like lebanon and jordan ? 
  ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/179bd/production/_85410769_syrian_refugees_62regions.png ) ** fact check : ** for every 10 refugees there are in the eu , there are 11 in lebanon . 
  ( according to the unhcr )  this really is n't our problem . 
  false . 
  here 's the basic realpolitik of the situation : 1 . 
  there 's a war going on next to the eu 's territory . 
  1 in 5 of the refugees from that war have show up in the eu . 
  the eu did nothing to stop this from happening , and they are basically too weak , underfunded , and disorganized to do anything to respond to the scale of the problem now . 
  therefore ... it ** is ** the eu 's problem . 
  if my neighbor 's house catches fire , i might go `` it 's not my problem '' . 
  but if the flames spread to my house , then it ** becomes ** my problem . 
  that 's exactly how this whole syrian war thing has played out for europe . 
  they should have thought about that when they were electing not to help put out the fire . 
  you dudes made your bed . 
  now you can lie in it . 
  take that canada !, 
  is n't that the solution that jordan and lebanon usually use ? 
  how is that working out ? 
  not sure whether to laugh or to cry, 
  ** #notsurprised **, 
   i 'm glad east europe is saying ` fuck this mess ' ...  hateful and middleage `` civilization '' lol . 
  whatever slobodan . 
  if any other civilization invaded yours , they 'd actually make it less hateful . 
  last i checked , the last time there was a genocide anywhere on the planet ... ** you dudes ** were the responsible party . 
  which ultimately resulted in us telling you to stfu . 
  i 'm not sure who was asleep at the switch and let you guys join the eu . 
  how ? 
  the euopeans have so far responded by : * by complaining that the italian navy is completely overwhelmed , * by refusing to put boots on the ground in syria , * by refusing to work with the regime in libya controling the key parts of the coast * by deploying three , yes three nato ships to the agean sea . 
  three . 
  * by begging the turks for help , but not offering them anything whatsoever that they actually value , in return * by symbolically closing this or that internal border , generally by sending in 100 or 200 gendarmes , which considering that 1.1 million people have come so far , is n't even enough men to even be noticed . 
  let 's face it . 
  the europe allies , lack the resources , manpower , and organization to do anything about it . 
  merkel or no merkel . 
  that 's your ** real ** problem . 
   just take a look at australia . 
  australia is an island nation . 
  a distant one . 
  which actually has a real navy & coast guard . 
  in what was is that like europe ? 
   stop . 
  taking . 
  migrants !, 
   that is n't really germany 's fault . 
  germany did not create the syrian civil war . 
  they did n't create isis either . 
  they were not the only european country refusing to do something about this whole thing before it turned into a refugee crisis . 
  and they are n't the only european country with insufficient resources , personnel , etc to do anything whatsoever about 1.1 million people trying to make their way to europe . 
  basically , every country who explicitly ignored the syrian situation until it was too late , is equally responsible for this mess . 
  while i am surprised that there 's any semblance of the rule of law there at all whatsoever , the main question here is being ignored . 
  do these 60 arrests constitute some kind of substantial slice of the refugees actually moving through the country ? 
  or is 60 such a small percentage that the entire thing just purely symbolic , while actually being an exercise in futility ? 
  ( which is what we usually see from the european allies ) ? 
   nor the ~ ~ right ~ ~ ** actual capability ** to abandon refugees and immigrants to their fate . 
  this is somewhat closer to the actual reality on the ground . 
  wow , i did n't realize that romanian police were even competent enough to actually capture 60 persons . 
  just out of curiosity ... what percent of the total number of refugees passing through romania 's border per day does 60 even represent ? 
  is it like 1 % or maybe 1.5 % ? 
  yeah , that 's kind of a weird cultural difference between the states and nl ( i used to live there ) . 
  whereas american schools openly brag about how many nationalities they have got in the classroom , and parents tend to look out for that just as much as for the student-to-teacher ratio , dutch parents are really much more wary about having their kinds in school that are more multicultural . 
  to me it indicates that the dutch are failing badly somewhere where the americans are n't . 
  what are the dutch doing wrong ? 
   russia wont dare do anything . 
  that 's what the georgians also thought . 
  and the baltic states are spending time training their security forces to battle a ukraine-type `` hybrid-warfare '' scenario ... which is to say that they 're worried about russian irregular insurgency . 
  meanwhile , mentioning who has more and better equipment is n't really always the crux of the matter . 
  for example , it 's pretty clear that the russians are having a more profound impact on isis that any eu member nations ( or even the whole entirety of the eu ) . 
  and they 're doing it supposedly with fewer military resources . 
   this just serves us intrests , the actual protectio the us delivers has been close to 0 for quite some time . 
  not sure if the baltic nations feel this way about the us military presence on their soil . 
  also not sure if countries who had the us help them out with yugoslavia and libya feel this way . 
  ** this just in : ** european allies to continue shamelessly free-riding the alliance, 
   but i do agree that europe all too often likes to sit idly by while america cleans up all the messes . 
  ( even if many of those messes were american-made ) i think that this is a fair way to see it . 
  but it 's worth mentioning that this attitude is turning out to be very ( financially ) expensive for the european allies . 
  i 'll bet that the decision to completely ignore the situation in syrian situation until it turned into a full-blown refugee crisis is looking a lot different $ 50 billion later . 
  woulda been cheaper and easier not to ignore the situation in syria . 
  maybe the germans will learn that the next time the european neighborhood goes up in flames . 
  flimsy , shitty fence + 900,000 people trying to get away from isis = flimsy fence with lots of holes in it . 
   is sweden prepared to deal with nearly a hundred thousand people who refuse to play ball ?
