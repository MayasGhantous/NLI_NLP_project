  and ** that ** is the main point of this whole saga . 
  if the numbers of refugees involved get large enough , then all of this tough-looking posturing just falls apart . 
  europe should 've thought about that when they were doing doing nothing whatsoever about this while this crisis was in its incubation stages back in 2011 . 
  meh ... i say that the danes brought those sorts of comparisons onto themselves . 
  do n't wan na be compared to the germans ? 
  then do n't behave like them . 
  it 's that simple . 
   the power-balance is nowhere close to that of the balkans though . 
  ~ ~ native europeans are still an indomitable majority on the continent . ~ ~ i 'm comparing syria today to the balkans 20 years ago . 
  power balance ? 
  at the start , the serbs had all the hard power . 
  that they learned to stfu was the result of our intervention . 
  but the most important detail is that the other , more minor factions did n't get along with eachother . 
  that makes it quite a lot like syria . 
  that would require explicit turkish approval ( which is unlikely to happen at the present time ) . 
  and , we all saw last month what happens to foreign forces who enter turkish sovereign territory w/o explicit turkish approval . 
   just because oyu have a boat and and outboard does n't mean you can go where eer you want without consequence . 
  when you are 950k people you can pretty much do whatever you want . 
  imo , they are similar to isis in the following way : * we ignore them --  they make war , kill people , & create refugees * we send in peace keepers and also tell them to stfu -----  the region they 're oppressing gets pacified . 
  so basically , what we are seeing now is just a repeat of the balkans , but with a lot more inaction ( and vaginal bleeding ) on the part of our european allies . 
   no of course not . 
  its our responsibility to protect our external borders . 
  instead of inviting syrians to come to europe , we should have set up asylum procedures long ago in jordan , turkey , and lebanon . 
  that way we would 've deterred people from crossing the mediterranean , and controlled how many and who we let in . 
  yes , i would say that involving the transit countries is a big part of what needs to be done . 
  needless to say , the eu has generally been less than interested in getting involved in the transit regions . 
  that has been part of the problem . 
  italy ( which is mainly a transit country ) has complained a lot about this . 
  lebanon meanwhile , is completely overwhelmed by the scale of the problem relative to the size of their country . 
  turkey is n't really helping much either . 
  the libyan region responsible is under the control of a separatist government , who has made it plain that in the absence of eu cooperation , they 're more worried about isis 's activities within libya , than about italy 's concerns . 
  all of that has just exacerbated the scale of the issue . 
   i just thought it was funny that he attributed europe lacking balls to not increasing military efforts in the region . 
  whatever form he proposes those efforts would take , would only escalate an already fucked up proxy war between several major powers . 
  i propose treating the situation similar to the way that bosnia and kosovo were treated . 
  send in the blue helmets , and draw up a long term peace accords . 
  if that put a stop to the endless , endless wars in the balkans ( featuring the last genocide of the 20th century ) , then it could work just as well now . 
  yes . 
  thank you !, 
  that was exactly my point . 
  europe needs to do a better job of guarding its own national interests in its own neighborhood . 
  and that is independent of whether my countries government did lots of stupid shit while bush was in office . 
   it 's american adventuring in the middle-east that caused the entire shit show in the first place not really the relevant point though . 
  the point is that it 's ** the europeans ** who end up paying the cost of things going wrong in the european neighborhood . 
  that 's part of how you define the `` near-abroad '' in the first place, 
   syria is n't really in the european neighbourhood . 
  it 's in the next housing estate over . 
   imo , the `` near-abroad '' is any region where the local events can have an immediate effect on the domestic situation . 
  in the monroe doctrine ( 1820s ) , the us pretty much declared that the entire western hemisphere was the `` near-abroad '' for russia , it 's pretty much the entire former ussr , and also anywhere with a russian-speaking minority . 
  also , serbian and the former warsaw pact . 
  for china , it 's the entire south china sea region . 
  so , in fact a `` near-abroad '' can turn out to be rather large . 
   poor attempt at a joke , given that my country is as likely to leave the eu as stay right now . 
  really ? 
  i was under the impression that in order for the brexit vote to have any shot at success , it pretty much needed to be voted on without scottish participation . 
   absolutely , however it 's important to remember ( and how could anyone forget in / r/europe ? ), 
  that europe has waaaay more migrants than refugees arriving . 
  it 's a migrant problem rather than a refugee problem . 
   i keep hearing that around the internet ( although the last time i saw figures from the unhcr , they said something along the lines of 60 % being from syria , 20 % from afghanistan , and 8 % from iraq ) . 
  but whatever , i 'm not the unhcr , and i do n't feel that haggling over this point is going to change any realities on the ground . 
  ** even if ** it 's just a total coincidence that there 's a war in the european neighborhood , and 900k people just coincidentally happen to show up , europe is still being overwhelmed , regardless of whether we call it a blue dress , or a white dress . 
  in the 1980s we had the mariel boat lift . 
  120k refugees . 
  that overwhelmed the both the us coast guard and state of florida . 
  your situation is 7 times that bad . 
  the source of the problem has got to be brought under control . 
  stat . 
    so ... you guys should basically try acting like a union . 
   i 'm british so i 'm going to just look embarrassed at this . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  sorry if i 'm not being clear . 
  my basic point is that if you strangle the problem at its source , then you 're not gon na be having 900k refugees in the first place . 
  that 's the basic reason why we there are troops in haiti , accords with cuba & panama , and our intervention in all of the central american conflicts . 
  my view is that once the scale of the issue is reduced down to a more normal proportion , the institutions and plans which are already in place are probably not going to get overwhelmed . 
  but now that they have been overwhelmed by 900k people , it 's probably in europe 's best interest to collaborate among member nations on this somehow . 
  also , i think that the european allies should stop being assholes to italy everytime it asks for help with this issue . 
  seeing italy get overwhelmed is n't going to lead to anything but trouble in the rest of europe . 
  so ... you guys should basically try acting like a union . 
  of course none of that is going to matter if isis sends another 900k people you way in 2016 . 
  so you 'd better go and deal with them . 
  it 's a bit late at this point . 
  the serbs have already been pacified . 
   well , germany is not capable of real military action . 
  you guys should probably fix that . 
  france managed it in 2013 . and they have a smaller economy & population that does germany . 
   we and other nato members relied on the us for decades and as far as i can tell you guys were n't too unhappy to take the as a washingtonian , i can say that the common view in washington ( which has been prevailing since the libyan crisis ) , is that you guys are free-riding us way too much . 
  it 's costing us lots of money , and it 's forcing us to pay attention to your neighborhood for you , when what we ** really ** need to be paying attention to is the growing situation in the pacific region . 
  as the germans sometimes say ( so i hear ) : `` de chinese mann schlaft nicht '', 
   in the case of syria and iraq , i fail to see why europe should bear the brunt of the weight in eliminating daesh because in case the 950k refugees this year have n't made it perfectly clear ... ** it `` s your own damned neighborhood . 
   i meant what action do you think should be taken in our local european neighbourhood . 
  i see . 
  well , a good model for dealing with the immediate problem would be doing exactly what [ france did to al-q in mali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval ) in 2013 . 
  aqim was so severely emasculated that they 've only ever tried one further action since then . 
  and the malians dealt with it themselves . 
  beyond that , i recommend having gotten some state-building done such that the immediate neighbor countries could help adopt refugees without getting completely overwhelmed . 
  focus on lebanon and tunisia , since those are the smallest two . 
  next , the roles of turkey and russia have got to be brought into line . 
  they are mostly just making everything worse . 
  lastly , a peace process similar to the dayton peace accords could be enacted in the lr ( if the turks and russians could just be told to stfu ) . 
   well , yes , 20 years ago it was a european nation at war with itself , this time that is n't occurring .
