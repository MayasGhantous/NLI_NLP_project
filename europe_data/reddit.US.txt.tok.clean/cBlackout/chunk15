  if this cools down i expect it will go back to business as usual and the eu will slowly integrate as it has been . 
   it absolutely exists , it 's just difficult to see most of the time over all the bickering between our leaders . 
  it exists in the populace as well though ; the citizens ultimately inform the leaders . 
   i know what you meant . 
  but i woke up in sweden to read about the brussels attacks and my reaction was pretty much the same as if they 'd attacked stockholm . 
  these attacks hit close to home for many europeans even if it did n't happen on our countries ' own soil . 
  like i wrote the other day , it 's an attack on the very core of europe . 
  it might be because i love and plan on working in europe , and while i also do n't mean to turn this into a contest , i was up at 5 in the morning trying to gather all the information i could about the attacks . 
  it 's possible that it just has to do with a western mindset unifying us all . 
   if san francisco suffered some horrible attack like this , you would n't see people in chicago shrugging and saying they 're unaffected . 
  i think that 's a key difference in the way a lot of people see it though , and i 've been thinking a lot about this today ; were any state attacked by an islamic extremist it would be seen by all americans as an attack on the united states rather than one on , for example , san bernardino , california , or the west coast . 
  contrarily , if yesterday 's thread regarding belgian intelligence is any example , solidarity between european nations exists mostly at a superficial level . 
  it 's my opinion that centralization in europe into a more singular entity is the only way that europe will be able to stay competitive with asia and north america , but right now it seems as though europe is more divided than it has been in a very long time . 
  you know what i meant . 
  and as much as i would love european solidarity , it simply does n't exist at this point in time at the level it needs to . 
   it 's funny because terrorists are joking on social media , `` what color will the eiffel tower be next ? '', 
  sauce ? 
   so i think it 's time to admit that the best way to ensure terrorists dont win is to make them lose . 
   not make pointless `` displays of defiance '' which mean nothing like attacking a random mosque in an unaffected country , got it . 
  attacks against mosques and muslims who are european citizens will only further alienate second and third generation immigrants and produce more homegrown extremists . 
  back to / r/the _ donald with yee , 4 day old account . 
   the only presidential candidate who said anything anout mollenbeek was trump and he 's against refugee resettling . 
  yes , i 'm aware of trump 's pseudo-fascist ramblings regarding outsiders , particularly the one regarding the wall for which he has repeatedly lied about the price and viability of and the deportation plans which would be legally and logistically impossible to carry out . 
   and he 'll win . 
  i hope . 
  fascinating . 
  his has been my position for a while now . 
  in light of the belgian suicide attacks i still think the us should be resettling more syrians . 
  it 's evident , however , that the same should not be applied to europe . 
  i do n't agree with all of his politics , but ross douthat is brilliant , having graduated magna cum laude from harvard and being elected into phi beta kappa . 
   they did n't have the same problems 1 month ago either . 
  what does this mean ? 
  if you 're insinuating they did n't have problems with terrorism and now they have , i suggest you go and read around . 
  that 's the point . 
  belgium thirty years ago did n't have the problems with islamic extremism that they have had in the post 2001 world , but it 's evident that they 've been extremely slow to adapt . 
   why it 's been negligent ? 
  according to this subreddit , the country is a `` war zone '' , and this has been the first semi-succesfull terrorist plot in decades . 
  34 belgians died . 
  it 's not semi-successful , that 's a successful terrorist attack . 
  again , as the article discusses , belgian intelligence has simply not adapted to have the capacity to deal with a real threat . 
  20 officers monitoring 20 burner phones is a gross misuse of resources and i think , knowing that , that the only reason belgium did n't have anything happen sooner was that nobody really tried in an organized fashion . 
  which is , to be honest , a miracle , since terrorism is so easy . 
  heck , these suicide bombings have happened literally on the day of the 1 year ` anniversary ' of the germanwings suicide crash . 
  it 's easy if nobody is looking for it or if intelligence agencies are , for whatever reason , incapable of doing anything about it . 
  there is * always * coordination and correspondence between terrorists about to commit acts of terror . 
   sorry , but that 's _ exactly _ the type of short-sightnedness typical of post-tragedy drama that i want to avoid . 
  you have a provable track record that becomes a `` provable track record '' in quotes just because of something someone feels . 
  it 's a probable track record in that they never really were tested and things went alright because belgium was peaceful . 
  paris should have been a wake up call for belgium , but apparently it took an attack at home to bring enough light onto the problems it faces . 
  i 'm not sure what 's short sighted about reforming something that clearly has a lot of flaws . 
   again : by turning belgium into an orwellian paradise ? 
  the same orwellian paradise that can not guarantee in the end that these attacks will not occur anymore ? 
  if competence in an intelligence agency designed to protect belgians from threats such as islamic terrorism is orwellian , then apparently we interpreted orwell 's works very differently . 
  nobody suggested we have big brother watching our every move . 
  but it 's inexcusable that each of 20 burner phones has to have its own officer monitoring it . 
   what it is rather disgraceful about this article is the fingerpointing to the intelligence service , the very services that work ** under the rules set out by politicians ** . 
  they have to observe the law in the end : the fact that their tools are not sufficient in a legal , financial and general professional sense is not their fault . 
  i think you 're absolutely right in this , but i think that when people criticize the intelligence service itself they 're inherently criticizing the tools they 're allotted . 
  of course , comments about the belgian intelligence officers being child-like are certainly eye opening , however i do n't think that belgians are inherently bad at intelligence . 
  i think you 're right in that the framework in which they operate needs to change to facilitate effectiveness . 
   there 's nothing wrong with critizing just about everything that went wrong in the belgian intelligence climate for the past years . 
  just know at who to direct it at first , instead of instantly blaming the security services for the fact that others underfunded and understaffed them . 
  i agree , but if it is true that belgian intelligence officers really are as na\u00efve as other western governments are making them out to be , then there 's a problem in both areas . 
   why ? 
  are you one of those than promote reviewing gun ownership polices right after mass shootouts ? 
  have you ever noticed that gun policies never change unless in reaction to mass shootings ? 
  yet every time one happens the nra comes scuttling out claiming it 's too soon , and ultimately nothing changes . 
  frankly i do n't lean hard either way in regards to gun control , but it 's not hard to see the strategies the nra uses to prevent change from ever occurring . 
   actually i think that _ now _ is the _ worst time _ to make changes . 
  you need a unbiased view to make reasonable changes ( rather than patriot acts ) . 
  and experience says we wo n't have unbiased views for weeks . 
  the question is whether or not changes will happen at all if the iron is n't struck while hot . 
   people are ignoring the 30 + man-years of successes for a failure one day . 
  and they 're very good at ignoring it . 
  this is just na\u00efve . 
  belgium did n't have the same problems 30 years ago that they do today with islamic terrorism . 
  and that 's ultimately one of the major points of the article , that belgian intelligence has been almost negligent in adapting to current realities because of this same attitude . 
  and even calling it a failure of a single day is disingenuous , especially in the context of the article , in which the problems in belgian intelligence reach all the way back to the paris attack and the time leading up to it . 
  those `` successful '' 30 years of relative peace using an apparently flawed system are more indicative of the scale of current challenges facing belgian intelligence ** today ** than they are of some perceived effectiveness of the agencies ' past performance . 
  do you think that belgium should be immune to criticism from nations that have had terrorist attacks in the past ? 
  if so that eliminates every western european country save andorra . 
  clearly there is an identifiable problem in belgian intelligence , but it would seem as though people * want * to ignore it because to acknowledge it would be to admit that foreign criticism is valid . 
  belgium just lost 34 innocents . 
  if there 's a time to make changes , it 's now . 
  after the failed first attempt at bringing down the world trade center , you 're probably right . 
  however , you really oversimplify the events ( particularly the invasions ) and in the aftermath those two organizations have definitely been taking terrorism seriously . 
  still , i do n't think i 'd describe them as hypercompetent . 
  what a shitshow of a comment section . 
  the fact that people are taking issue with the * tone * in which the us criticized belgian intelligence further validates the claim that dealing with this kind of situation is like dealing with children . 
  instead of getting defensive because of the tone , the mature reaction would be to take what the us , uk , and france are all saying into consideration . 
  because as much as it might hurt to admit , it 's not unlikely that they 're right . 
  that 's apples and oranges , honestly . 
  the majority of shootings are gang related and it 's unrealistic to expect the fbi to stop every gang related murder . 
  as for mass shootings , again it 's extremely difficult to completely verify something in order to act preemptively . 
  i love the deflections of criticism going on in this thread . 
  none of that is really realistic though . 
  even if we decided to go with your `` brutality . '', 
   ahahaha you really believe that , do you ? 
  it absolutely was . 
  italy and france ( more so the former than the latter ) got all the oil contracts as well as an increased presence in libya and france maintained its influence in francophone africa , which libya had begun to challenge .
