  that 's irrelevant to my point . 
  the us and germany are n't relevant because the point was that saddam was awful for iraq . 
  the us and germany did n't gas the kurds and drain the marshes . 
  trying to shift the blame off of a dictatorial maniac to the us and germany is just pathetic . 
   i did n't said that saddam was good , but your invasion was even worse . 
  that 's a valid claim , more for some demographics of iraq than others . 
  but do n't try to say it was `` my '' invasion . 
  i did n't support it then , i do n't support it now . 
   you 're about to elect donald `` hell of a lot worse than waterboarding '' trump as a president and you think you can give lessons to the world ? 
  what a brilliant comment . 
  ** i ** am not for trump in any way shape or form . 
  but here 's a fucking lesson for you , do n't use chemical weapons to massacre hundreds of thousands of your own population . 
  if you 're going to try to use my nationality to discredit that message , then i ca n't take you seriously . 
  it 's amazing how you try to move the topic of the conversation from saddam hussein 's war crimes to what 's happening in the united states . 
   i love how americans pretend to manipulate history , he used chemical weapons on his own people because that people was allied with iran so let me get this straight - you 're trying to justify the use of chemical weapons on thousands of civilians right now ? 
  do you realize how many innocents the anfal campaign killed ? 
  that 's not warping history . 
  that 's fact . 
   your enemy and the enemy of the gulf states . 
  if the us cared about saddam killing iraqis you would have helped them during the shia and kurd uprising of 1991 . 
  i never claimed that the us has been doing things to help the iraqi people . 
  the us has its own interests prioritized . 
  it 's disingenuous to pretend that saddam was in any way good for the the vast majority of the iraqi people , however . 
  i love just how short redditors ' memories are . 
  people here talk about saddam like he was god 's gift to iraq because now iraq is unstable , when in the past saddam was fucking bloodthirsty , using chemical weapons on his own people and draining the marshes . 
  what 's in iraq now is far from ideal , but let 's not kid ourselves by pretending that saddam was great for iraq and iraqis . 
  from a lovely little conversation i had regarding that same russian mindset  and the best part is there is absolute zero you can do about it . 
  the mindset is something to regard with respect and due consideration or confront as if it was a trivial matter , which i can assure you it is not . 
  i honestly ca n't tell if this is sarcastic . 
  that would make the meat taste worse . 
   maybe we look too swedish welcome to the current state of sweden , where looking like the native ethnic group can actually warrant assault . 
  condescending and yet void of anything resembling a contribution to the thread . 
  nice . 
  what is your point ? 
  it 's not racist . 
  it 's the same reason i avoid brazilians when they come to the beaches where i live . 
  especially if surfing is involved . . 
   it 's not about russia but the local population which has its inalienable rights forcefully suppressed by the west-installed ` democratic ' government . 
  coming from a russian this is * so * fucking ironic . 
  like your government gives a flying fuck about inalienable human rights and self-determination . 
  like the kremlin cared what the local dagestani and chechen population wanted * at any time in russian history * . 
  like the russians care about what any of the baltic populations want or have ever wanted . 
  the only reason that you act like your government supports anything about local populations is because in this scenario it benefits the russian federation . 
   the current regime in ukraine is literally fascist : people get jailed for * speech * ; really ? 
  the situation in ukraine in regards to freedom of press and speech is remarkably similar to that of russia . 
  i 'm not sure what high ground you 're trying to take here . 
   political parties witness their entire enterprise torched to ashes without any legal protection from the ` government ' ; pretty heavy on hyperbole . 
  ukrainian democracy is pretty shitty , i 'm not denying that . 
  i 'm not sure , however , if russia 's is much better given that until 2012 the creation of new political parties was consistently blocked by the government . 
  so again , i 'm not sure what high horse you 're trying to take . 
  you 're championing the local people 's rights , as if they 'd under russian rule  people get executed en masse in broad day light while being recorded on camera and no one gets prosecuted simply because the perps are ` pro-eu ' nazis ; point me to an example of people being executed en masse by ukrainian nazis . 
  let me guess , they also crucify russians ? 
   the paid for electricity is being cut off for * months * to an entire peninsula leaving * two million people * totally deprived ; russia annexed it and therefore is responsible for providing energy for the civilians there . 
   the state 's human rights officials cheer murder ; ministers of the freedom of speech publicly beat up directors of tv stations for airing `` wrong content '' oh my god this is gold . 
   densely populated areas are being cluster-bombed and artillery shelled do you realize how much of this artillery and rocketry has come from across the russian border ? 
  how can you blame the ukrainians for something your government is doing as well ? 
   ; ** at least a quarter ** of the population is viewed as ` enemies ' ** that literally deserve to be executed ; ** police is being openly subdued by mobs of armed terrorist thugs thus being 100 % dysfunctional ; etc. 
  and it all started with ` euromaidan ' . 
  you 're fucking delusional . 
   millions of people would raze this madness in its entirety if only given an actual opportunity , while having all the rights in the world to resist it by any means necessary . 
  what the fuck does this sentence even mean . 
   and the vast majority of russia will support those people without blinking twice . 
  which is , incidentally , how russians support putin in every other scenario as well . 
  without thinking about it . 
  it does n't seem like russians ever hear anything critical of their governments from within russia . 
  and naturally , since the west is russia 's enemy , their criticism lands on deaf ears . 
   this is how things actually are on the other end of the ` revolution of dignity ' in the newly created mob-ran state of total anarchy . 
  so much empty rhetoric in such a small amount of text . 
  on one hand , the ukrainian government is fascist . 
  on the other , they 're promoting anarchy . 
  i hope you realize that the two are indeed mutually exclusive and that you are n't doing a great job of being consistent in your hysterical rambling . 
   legally does n't mean anything . 
  great , so remind me why nato should n't expand right up to the russian border ? 
  because if i recall correctly russians * love * to whine about how the west * promised * nato would n't expand into the former soviet sphere of influence . 
  the duma recently declared the secession of the baltics from the soviet union illegal . 
  why did they do that if legality is irrelevant ? 
   legally nato had no right to depose qaddafi ; nato had a un resolution backing them . 
   legally us had no right to invade iraq and turn the entire middle east into a bloodbath for decades to come ; remember folks , the united states is the source of all of the middle east 's problems . 
  saddam hussein did n't use chemical weapons on the kurds and iranians , and he certainly did n't try to kill off the people living in the marshes . 
  the united states did !, 
  what the us did in iraq is awful . 
  but to say that the middle east was n't a bloodbath before is simply ignorant of history . 
   legally not a single foreign entity outside of russia/iran/lebanon is allowed to operate within syrian territory , - yet all these legalities are thrown out the window as if nothing but a toilet paper . 
  so what you 're saying is , we should disregard law and simply rely on might makes right ? 
   historically , though , * the entire * south-east of that god-forsaken state is * russian * , before russian it was ottoman , then it was * gifted * to this horde of judas as a gesture of good will , only to be stabbed in the back in the most gruesome way imaginable . 
  historically , though , the entirety of the region we now call russia was ruled by nomadic peoples from the steppe . 
  which should be some indication of how irrelevant your point was . 
   the russian regions of odessa , nikolaev , kherson , dnepropetrovsk , eventually will be returned into the native harbor because apparently that 's what those installed in kiev want with their constant taunting and testing of one 's determination . 
  the truth of the matter is it they are begging for wo n't fit in their mouths . 
  k , i wo n't hold my breath . 
   and the best part is there is absolute zero you can do about it . 
  which is a shame . 
  but at least you admit it . 
   the mindset is something to regard with respect and due consideration or confront as if it was a trivial matter . 
  can you give me one single reason why any non-russian would even pretend to respect your frankly terrifyingly outdated mindset ? 
  and i mean outdated in every possible metric . 
   absolutely wow . 
   before ` euromaidan ' there was absolute zero territorial disputes nor such high level of inter-national tensions . 
  probably because russia had n't caused any yet ? 
   only after those ` mothers and daughters ' - ( c ) nuland - ah , the old nuland conspiracy .
