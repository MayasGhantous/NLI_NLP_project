  because it seems like the only groups that take issue with the current state of affairs are also those labelled all of the above , which sounds like a very frustrating position for europeans to be in . 
  personally i would like more syrian refugees in the united states , but i empathize with europeans who are frustrated about the migrants . 
  on one hand i see comments saying that pegida is fine and actually anti-nazi , and on the other there are users complaining about the quality of the subreddit based on the former comments . 
  can anybody give a decent explanation ? 
  seems pretty irrelevant in this context . 
  movies , and the leaders of western nations . 
   we are interested that afghanistan does n't turn back into a complete shithole . 
  bullying does n't sound like the right way to guarantee that . 
  as if germany of all countries can guarantee that afghanistan wo n't get shittier . 
  if you want them to change their tune you 'll have to push them around economically , or they 'll continue not giving a shit what germany wants . 
  applying sanctions will inevitably make afghanistan shittier , so i guess germans will have to decide whether the well being of germany or afghanistan is more important . 
   and bribing ? 
  so tomorrow we have to bribe every single country to do what international law requires them to do ? 
  international law requires them to do something , and yet there 's nothing actually making them do it , as evidenced by the fact that * afghanistan * just said fuck you to both germany and international law . 
  what it seems that people do n't understand is that in order to get nations to follow international law there needs to be coercion . 
  with russia , we sanctioned the shit out of them and helped to tank their economy , and even then that 's not enough to get them to leave eastern ukraine . 
  what will germany do to coerce the afghans , who do n't care in the least about germany , to take back emigrants that they do n't even want ? 
  write them a letter about ordnung and the importance of international law ? 
  you might have to do what you just did with turkey and pay up . 
  i would n't doubt that europe could bully or bribe afghanistan into adjusting this policy . 
  whether or not they 'd have the spine to do it is another question . 
  but hey , maybe germany will get another round of gastarbeiters to pretend to integrate . 
  eh , i do n't think they have enough in common with italians for that . 
  it probably would n't matter since they 're so small , but i doubt the maltese would be thrilled about it . 
  they speak a semitic language after all , not very similar to italian . 
  french revolution was an american plot !, 
  a movement as big as la r\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise could never be organized and accomplished without foreign backing and modern technology that makes communication instant between masses of people !, 
  investigate waterloogate !, 
  august insurrection was an inside job !, 
  `` nobody is allowed to have a capable military in the region but us ! '', 
  really the only viable way of managing this whole crisis it seems is to follow the australians in their methods . 
  can you outline them like i asked ? 
  if they wo n't stop , how would you stop them ? 
  sounds about right for san francisco . 
  i 'm a san diego native and people are a little more conservative there , but the occasional naked surfer sometimes graces the beach . 
  europe could be the most powerful country in the world right now , if it were a country . 
  but to achieve that it will take sacrifice from individual nation states , and it 's pretty clear that none of europe 's nation states are willing to make those sacrifices . 
  it 's understandable , but it wo n't be good for europe collectively in the long run . 
  if you are a border guard and an immigrant wo n't stop if you tell him to , what do you do in that situation ? 
  not taking either side at the moment , just curious as to what you think should be done . 
  i 'm in austin , texas at the moment and it 's fairly common for women to go to eg barton springs topless . 
  #freethenip is fairly popular among women here . 
  so the us is n't completely anti-nudity , although bottomless would n't be popular with either gender in public . 
  yep , it 's a really good system i think . 
  what state are you in , because in california at least you can get first priority in transferring to some amazing universities . 
   $ 50k a year for undergrad ?? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  [ medical school ] ( https://www.uth.edu/registrar/tuition-and-fees/medical-school---resident-tuition-2015---2016.htm ) is way cheaper than that and that leads to a lucrative $ 200k/annual career . 
  even harvard is free . 
  like i said , many of the universities with these high tuition costs also give lots of money for financial aid . 
  but yes , it is absurd . 
   americans need to shop around and take a personal finance class . 
  there is no excuse to be in so much debt . 
  yes , for many debt is a major problem . 
  but americans are n't all doing this , if you saw my earlier post . 
  many of my friends did two years of community college and then transferred into the uc system , which is an excellent education for a much smaller fee . 
   and no excuse to be majoring in useless art degrees . 
  personally i think it 's shitty that people treat college like that , in that instead of it being a center of learning where you can educate yourself on a topic that you 're genuinely interested in , you instead have to be in one of a ( relatively ) few select programs or nobody takes you seriously because you potentially wo n't be making as much money as them . 
  out of curiosity , what university did you go to ? 
  that 's relatively cheap too . 
  some universities have up to 50 thousand/yr . 
  typically though those universities are more generous with scholarship money though , particularly private universities . 
   there should be plenty of options to get a good education without debt , with minimal miscellaneous services . 
  there are . 
  we have community/junior colleges that are cheap but are n't similar to normal 4 year universities . 
  many of my friends who were n't as well off monetarily went to community for two years and then transferred directly into uc schools ( for community college in california . 
  i 'm not sure about in other states but in california , many uc schools have guaranteed transfers for community college students ) , saving a lot of money . 
  in addition , private universities are often more expensive but also give out much more money than public universities to make tuition easier for students ; the amount granted usually has to do with scores as you might imagine . 
  colleges in the united states are very diverse , and i 'm really not sure where you got the impression that colleges pandered to the elite . 
  why would you say that tunisia is in a state of unrest ? 
  and morocco is a fine country . 
   thank you for spending your time to write a long and civil response , you bring it many good points and i 'll try to respond to some of them . 
  and thanks for responding in kind , although i think i could have been more civil , admittedly . 
   i actually did n't know that about iran , that 's terrible thank you for correcting me . 
  yea , i was pretty shocked finding that out too . 
  i typically think that iran is a more natural ally for the west , but their government is a significant problem . 
   you 're right that malcom x ** did n't ** preach peace , ** at first ** . 
  after a pilgrimage to the mecca ( i believe ) he came back and rethought about his stances and stopped preaching hate and blaming white people . 
  he died because of it and we must know what he preached but also remember him how he was when he died . 
  was n't aware , thanks . 
   you right there , most expansion of islam was through conflict . 
  but remember that with centuries - thousands of years ago . 
  people did n't have civil rights , there was no u.n. 
  i mean you can say it is kinda silly to say that when the western world is based off roman and greek cultures who also conquered and had slaves . 
  i realize this but i would n't call that coexistence . 
   but what happened after the conquest is what better defines them . 
  the romans were great in this in being able to control the areas it took over by letting people keep their customs and religions . 
  one example of many religions coexisting was in spain . 
  muslims invaded spain and controlled it for hundreds of years . 
  they were tolerant and the religions lived together peacefully . 
  i suppose that there 's a point to be made about umayyad spain , although i 'm not qualified to speak on whether or not the inhabitants of the iberian peninsula were okay with being ruled by muslims at that point . 
   remember this was centuries ago before how much nicer humans are nicer to each other now . 
  it shows that it 's not as black and white . 
  but is this the exception rather than the rule ? 
  maybe not for the time , but i would say that later islamic expansion , particularly via the ottomans , got more ` brutal ' as time went on . 
   in fact when religious conflict actually came it was started by nationalistic type movement by the catholics that pushed the muslims out of spain . 
  which seems kinda fair , well yea , as in the nationalism of the 18-20th century , people typically want to be governed by their own . 
   but this was hundreds of years after the conquers ** and * the catholics [ began something we all know in love ! ], 
  ( http://i.imgur.com/bjr0jce.gif ) and began killing , pillaging , and torturing muslims , jews , and other christian sects and catholics if someone accused someone else . 
  indeed , the catholics of the time were awful .
