  i despise the man but watching him tear the republican party apart this election has to be the most entertaining thing i 've seen on television in years . 
  [ jesus christ ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/oranje,_drenthe ), 
  but why are syrian refugees relevant at all to this story ... you 're really grasping at straws . 
   and there we have it . 
  i know nothing about america , just like you know nothing about sweden . 
  you should speak for yourself . 
  and have a good day . 
   sweden has been around for a long time , much longer than the flag . 
  i understand it hard to comprehend for someone from such a young country . 
  what a fucking joke . 
  france has been around for a lot longer than the tricolor but you do n't think the french respect their flag and the history behind it ? 
   the flag is not important . 
  i do n't care what immigrants think of it , i do n't care about the flag . 
  so since you do n't care about a symbol that represents your nation , you 're okay with hiding it to accommodate foreigners living inside your nation ? 
   american patriotism is one of the most disgusting things i 've seen . 
  chanting usa usa usa and waving american flags att handegg matches when both teams are american if fucking stupid . 
  that 's an adorable strawman , but as an actual american who has been to actual gridiron football games , i can safely say that you 're a fucking idiot . 
  i 've been to probably two dozen football games , and never once have i seen a crowd chanting usa and waving flags at a game . 
  do you also think we bring our m240s to the games and fire into the air while wearing cowboy hats ? 
  because that 's what you sound like . 
   ** so yes , because you are american i dont care for your option **  ** so yes , because you are american i dont care for your option **  ** so yes , because you are american i dont care for your option **  edit : i actually shit on the american flag everyday . 
  i bought a bunch of toilet paper on sale with different flags on them . 
  and right now i 'm using the american one . 
  apparently immigrants to your country wipe their asses with your flag on a daily basis so i hope you were n't expecting me to be bothered by that statement . 
  it 's a symbol of your nation . 
  do n't act like its an american exclusive concept to respect your flag and what it stands for . 
  of course , i realize that being american means that nothing i say will make any difference to you - your go-to statement was to discount what i said based on my nationality . 
  but nonetheless i think the obsession with accommodating people who would be offended by the flag of the country * that they 're living in * is fucking pathetic . 
  how you justify this to yourself is beyond me . 
  lmfao , if the fact that you ca n't even fly your own nation 's flag inside your own country does n't upset you , you swedes are further gone than we thought . 
  the only thing that stops a bad guy with a grenade is a good guy with a grenade, 
   we want to make sure the students do not offend anyone using the flag why even exist as a fucking country anymore, 
  that the cia orchestrated the protests ? 
  that seems very factually wrong . 
  i guess the cia just has tens of thousands of ukrainians to send around . 
  the part where we put an unelected puppet in power is completely incorrect . 
  basically everything he 's said so far ? 
  i love when people try to make it look like the ukrainians were incapable of overthrowing their own horrible leader , and try to make russia look like a victim . 
  god forbid `` the average joe schmoe '' can travel . 
  obviously flight should be reserved for the real people , that is the wealthy . 
  after all , they 're the only ones who matter . 
  why should the peasants be able to move around ? 
  all you 're really doing is displaying confirmation bias . 
  the comments are n't very `` russophobic . '', 
   propaganda seems to fucking work  i have n't read the comments yet interesting, 
  turkey is actually very strong militarily . 
   how can you say that when a foreign power already has numerous military bases in europe ? 
  you 're free to ask us to leave whenever you so please . 
  not that you would , that would mean that countries like germany might actually have to make an effort . 
   face it , europe is a vassal of the american empire that 's hilarious . 
  we are n't threatening , but we 're moving assets into bordering countries so that russia knows that we 're invested in eastern european security and and that they 'll have to attack us if they do anything in the area . 
  seems often like we 're taking european security more seriously than western europeans . 
  that said , at least countries like poland and the baltic states are starting to take it seriously . 
  plus poland has a sexy new pl-01 in the making . 
  it 's ironic , because europeans used to have great militaries . 
  i guess it 's either military is an afterthought or germany is crushing belgium again . 
  eh , because we have large scale interests and europeans wo n't . 
  it 's in american interest to keep eastern europe out of the russian sphere of influence . 
  really it 's very much in western europe 's interests more so than anyone , but they do n't know that apparently . 
  i did n't think brits like this existed outside of borat-esque comedies , but i guess so . 
  gotcha , thank you . 
  i think it 's interesting that you chose a scar variant to represent change , any particular reason when an m4 would have sufficed ? 
  i would generally agree with you , but in regards to this crisis i think ` fills with ' is somewhat appropriate considering some countries ' refugee centers are literally overwhelmed by the amount of syrians and oddly more often people pretending to be syrians coming into them . 
  pardon my american , but why is the uk building ramped carriers ? 
  ie , what are the benefits compared to the downsides ? 
  seeing as the u.s. has 12 carriers and no ramps , i 'm curious as to why, 
  apparently they were eating like kings the whole time, 
  probably because he did n't speak swedish i would imagine, 
   ukbagabir explained that he `` just lost control '' after learning that he was going to be sent back to italy , according to his interview . 
  `` that 's why he committed the acts inside ikea against these two individuals ... to make people understand him . '' sigh . 
   people accept war and soldiers as `` normal '' and were conditioned to tolerate these things . 
  yea , that 's because a military is normal . 
  it 's not uncommon for people to be soldiers . 
  it never has been abnormal . 
   whenever you see soldiers you should say `` it 's your fault that there is war . 
  '' , because without soldiers there would be no international war . 
  jesus christ this is so na\u00efve . 
  yea , let 's just shit on our soldiers . 
  just like in the 70s , that worked great !, 
  ideologues i swear to god . 
  i 'm aware , it was a joke . 
   this attitude is exactly how trump won, 
  he 's a serb but a russian bootlicker nonetheless, 
  sauce, 
  well , ever since they illegally annexed crimea and occupied donbas we 've been doing a lot of drills with our allies in the region like the estonians and poles but your point remains . 
  lol check out [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5ajmno/nato_russia_to_hold_parallel_military_drills_in/d9hdqd7 ) wonder what he has to say about this, 
  lol but somebody told me that they were just tourists being framed by the montenegrin government to gain votes in the upcoming election, 
   do n't try to tell them that our agressive actions against russia yea , let me stop you right there before you keep licking boots . 
  are you just trolling or do you really have the audacity to call western actions towards russia aggressive when they literally invaded and annexed part of another country ? 
  gain some fucking perspective . 
   do not respond to their evilness holy shit . 
   but to us interests of maintaining global hegemony , you may even get banned here . 
  good fucking god your comment history is just filled with idiocy like this . 
  remind me why europe is more willing to sanction russia than the us will be come january if the whole goal is to maintain american hegemony ? 
  make sure to leave your persecution complex out of the response . 
   this sub is just an echo chamber for the propaganda on anglo-saxon news ( just look at the amount of english-speaking agencies ) it 's an english sub on an english speaking website . 
  gain some perspective . 
   but i 'll keep trying to be a voice of peace even when it feels so frustrating . 
  hahahaha no yea thanks , i 'm sure ukraine would love to sit around the campfire and sing kumbaya . 
  * the voice of peace * thinks that sanctions over ukraine are n't about an illegal annexation and occupation .
