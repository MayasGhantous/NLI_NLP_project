  an american talking about europe is corrected , downvoted , and crossposted to sas . 
  a european talking about the us gets 70 upvotes while he claims that anything outside of a major city is '' ** swathes of rednecks ** '' using dial-up . 
   the sheer arrogance of americans you realize how lacking in introspection this is right ? 
  go read the other comments in this thread and talk about arrogance . 
   telling us how we should handle a problem you created , really . 
  the us destabilized syria . 
  interesting , i could have sworn that was assad 's forces shooting protestors and dropping barrel bombs indiscriminately into neighborhoods , leading to the creation of rebel movements that were then hijacked by islamists pouring in from around the middle east and the west . 
  and last i checked there were definitely europeans present for iraq . 
  not to mention that overthrowing qaddafi was a european endeavor until they could n't sustain operations anymore and needed us logistics . 
  the most virulent kind of americans : angry trumptard nationalist , talking shit against anyone who does n't unquestionably obey the nationalist agenda . 
  note that i am not a trump supporter either . 
  i find them to be just as disgusting as you do . 
  trump 's brand of populism is n't isolated to the us though . 
  the netherlands , france , britain , germany , greece , etc all have popular politicians and parties that come from the same batch as trump , and as it happens their supporters are here as well . 
  but here 's the thing , you 're on an american website . 
  do n't act shocked that americans make up a significant portion of the users here . 
  '' ** vast swathes of that redneck country . 
   you fail to understand the eu point of view . 
  you know that us `` defends '' europe but you do n't seem to know how much profit us makes in europe and how much profit does eu make in us . 
  the balance is heavily tilted towards us . 
  really ? 
  i do n't think you realize how prevalent european companies are in the united states , even if they hide behind american-oriented brands [ does n't exactly look heavily tilted ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/united-states/ ) but i guess i should just take your word for it . 
   eu should defend it 's economic interests and should ask us corporations to pay fair taxes in eu or gtfo . 
  if the eu wants to defend its interests then it should n't allow tax havens to offer these deals to companies . 
  ireland , the netherlands , and luxembourg have long been known as tax havens . 
  the fact that this is the us being the bad guy because of ireland 's fuck up is baffling . 
   do n't give me stories about trade and bankrolling when us is continuously trying to rig the game and retaliates if they do n't get what they want ( ttip ) . 
  lmfao , ttip is trying to rig the game ? 
  there 's a reason that it spent so long in the negotiating stage . 
  because that 's how trade deals work , they are agreed upon by all parties . 
  if you do n't like the deals then do n't agree to them , which is what happened . 
  not sure how that 's trying to rig the game . 
   usa pretends to be a military ally but behaves like an economic enemy . 
  fascinating rhetoric . 
   it is all about what you are implying with your statement . 
  that 's what the fuck i am talking about . 
   take your armies elsewhere , see if it helps funding american healthcare ( another common argument i am sick of ) . 
  my statement implies that you 're a fucking idiot if you think that you 'd be better off without american capital ( i.e. 
  investments , trade goods , etc ) , and in today 's political reality , our bankrolling of your collective defense . 
  maybe if eu members like germany grew a fucking spine and actually started funding their militaries you would n't have so many american troops in europe . 
  ** trust me ** , we do n't want so many of them there either . 
  the fact of the matter is that now we have to alter our `` pivot to the pacific '' because russia is getting aggressive again and the eu wo n't do shit about it , even though its member states are in precarious positions and despite europe 's latent capacity to be more powerful than the us . 
  the day that european governments truly want americans out , they only need to ask . 
  but right now it 's only morons who also think removing american capital from europe would be a good idea for anyone . 
   that 's what the fuck i 'm talking about, 
  what the fuck are you even talking about, 
  the point is that the things that europeans criticize the us for are completely asinine . 
  the wood houses thing being a prime example despite wood being the best thing to build with in earthquake prone areas , which makes up pretty much the entire west coast . 
  in hurricane prone areas , it 's heavier cement . 
  our building standards are fine . 
  likewise , the implication that everything outside of a major city is swathes of rednecks with no infrastructure or internet is one of the stupidest things i 've ever read on this subreddit . 
   what utter , utter nonsense !, 
  if you set foot outside of major cities in the us you are immediately reduced to dial up internet and vast swathes of that redneck country are monopolies with absolutely no incentives to improve internet speed or customer service . 
  ** l o fucking l ** this is like that thread where the euros claimed how superior their building standards were . 
  `` why would anybody build homes from wood and not stone ? '', 
  probably because we do n't like it when entire villages disappear from small earthquakes . 
  but nope , it was summed up as awful american building standards . 
  the frequency with which this sub talks out its ass when comparing europe to the rest of the world is simply astounding . 
   i 'm fairly familiar with the region , but i have n't had any personal involvement with either disaster . 
  i just get the impression that the economy especially in the coastal la-ms-al area must not have been all that great before the deepwater horizon disaster , if you can still see , in some places , the rubbish and abandoned wrecks of houses from the hurricane . 
  well i can more easily speak about new orleans given how much time i 've spent there , but you are right . 
  the economy and population in new orleans is only recently starting to improve to pre-katrina levels , although i 've heard that a lot of newer startups are starting to move to new orleans which is promising . 
  but yea , katrina was so absolutely devastating to new orleans that it 's been a struggle to really get things back to where they were . 
  even just last year i drove to the house where my father grew up and you can still see a lot of the damage in the area . 
  mulberry drive , for what it 's worth , right next a levy . 
  however , the gulf spill was for new orleans a massive chunk of salt on a deep wound for people who made livings on the coast . 
  and as i said , the environmental impact is very significant as well . 
   according to relatives in the area , in some ways the oil spill gave a boost to the economy , as a lot of money , attention and new jobs suddenly appeared in an area that was previously largely ignored . 
  when the fisheries were basically no go zones a lot of fishermen did make better money than they were making before the spill because bp basically paid them a fixed rate to clean whereas before they made money depending on the catches . 
  and to keep them happy they paid good money apparently , i.e. 
  quite enough to compensate their usual income ( though those are the words of fishermen and i do n't have statistics to back that claim ) . 
  i ca n't really speak for many new jobs moving in after the spill aside from those improving safety regulations on oil rigs , which i have family in . 
  like i said , economically things are mostly back to normal in the gulf after the spill but for a while it was really messy , especially for tourism . 
  i 'm not sure what areas got attention though unless you mean federal funding . 
  cutting out one of your main trading partners , who also happens to bankroll your collective defense , is inherently a stupid idea . 
  how could you possibly think that removing american capital and defense from europe would be a good thing ? 
  and then saying that spying is a contributing factor ? 
  are you fucking kidding ? 
  for a while the only real work that people who previously depended on the affected areas was incidentally cleaning up the mess . 
  of course , for the tourism industry there was n't much they could do . 
  most of the fishing came to a halt as many fisheries were contaminated and the fishermen were paid by bp to go out and clean up . 
  now , the economy is back in order for the most part but the environmental impact will last for a long time , even if the spill 's contaminants are n't immediately visible . 
  all of that oil had to go somewhere , and somewhere largely means onto the seabed and into estuaries and environmentally sensitive and ecologically critical areas such as already threatened mangrove forests . 
  of course katrina did more damage to the entire region , but the gulf spill was on of the most significant man-made disasters the world has ever seen and the price that bp will have to pay is entirely justified . 
  that is , if they ever end up paying which is only a plausibility . 
  in addition a lot of their fine is tax deductible . 
  note , nearly the entirety of my father 's side of my family lives in louisiana , mississippi , and florida . 
   take their capital and army somewhere else if they do n't like it . 
  are you just dense or do you really think this would be a good idea for the eu, 
  they were fined $ 20 billion and will likely worm their way out of it like exxon has . 
  the other $ 28 billion spent involved cleaning up their disaster that tanked the southern coastal economy and did unspeakable damage to the environment . 
  which is roughly why the russians still prop up transnistria, 
  also new uniforms and equipment can have a surprising effect on morale , especially at a time of war . 
  new uniforms wo n't kick the russians out of the east but the soldiers will likely appreciate them . 
   i do n't know ... you will show some sugar bowl , democracy vs evil and invade . 
  without any proper reason . 
  you kinda have a reference . 
  you act like that 's exclusive to the us . 
  george bush ? 
  `` iraq has wmds '' vladimir putin and his associated media , his supporters and just general useful idiots ?
