  `` they 're literally crucifying ethnic russians ! '', 
  at least we acknowledge that we made a horrible mistake based on the lies of an awful leader . 
  i have yet to see that coming from russia in any circumstance . 
  but let 's see how this template works anyway . 
   i do n't know ... you will show some sugar bowl , self determination vs nazism and invade . 
  without any proper reason . 
  you kinda have a reference . 
  inb4 iraq was a-okay before the us showed up . 
   there was a time when russia was n't ` adversarial ' . 
  at that time it was taken over by foreign interests while nato moved closer to it 's borders although the opposite was promised . 
  jesus christ russians and their apologists and the famous `` promise . '', 
  [ even gorbachov denies its relevance ] ( https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/11/06/did-nato-promise-not-to-enlarge-gorbachev-says-no/ ) . 
  and again you ignore the fact that these countries * asked * to join nato . 
  they asked and why would nato say no ? 
  what does that say about the state they were trying to get away from ? 
  also , this ignores the rest of my comment . 
  why does russia * need * to be against the west ? 
  what complex exactly is it that means russia has to be anti-western ? 
  sure there was a brief period where both sides humored the idea of a nato or eu russia , but immediately after the dissolution of the ussr russia had sent troops to transnistria , and then the balkans happened , and then georgia , and now ukraine . 
  and given this quote from the 2009 russian envoy to nato `` great powers do n't join coalitions , they create coalitions . 
  russia considers itself a great power '' i do n't really see any actual desire for anything other than adversarial relations with the west . 
  the idea of russian cooperation with the rest of europe was hopeful thinking by a few idealists at best . 
  ukraine was just a confirmation that russia would have nothing to do with the west . 
  which brings me again , to why putin felt that russia had to make such a big deal out of essentially what could be a non issue . 
  `` the us * could * do * this * '' is not an excuse . 
  the us * could * go conquer the nation of canada but why would we ? 
  that still implies that the only possibility for russia post 2002 was armed reaction . 
   germeny today has no sovereignty . 
  the german government as well as brussels are pursuing globalist goals and care less about their people germ ** a ** ny has its sovereignty , it just happens that successful countries accept that globalism is n't something that you can wish away and they plan accordingly . 
  british voters voted against what they thought of globalism , where has that landed them ? 
  out of the union by maybe 2018 because this is actually more difficult than we thought ? 
  like it or not we live in a global environment and as much as you pretend it can be done away with it will never unless we completely destroy all technology from the last 100 years . 
  if you believe otherwise you 're extremely na\u00efve . 
  but yea no , i 'm sure it 's * germany * that does n't care about its people , as the entire russian economy falls below that of a single us state with less than 1/4th of the russian population . 
  i mean i got ta ask , is it really worth it ? 
  is ~ ~ isolation ~ ~ ~ ~ muh sovereignty ~ ~ total independence worth the land grabs and economic weakness ? 
  you just do n't get it !, 
  that was n't * real * communism !, 
  it 's like it never occurred to them that communism is a heavily flawed ideology that can never realistically exist in its `` true '' form, 
   e : sorry , ca n't heal your russophobia . 
  if you people stopped seeing things white/black and watched the fucking video ( i bet most of you didnt even open it ) , look at it from russias pov their reaction is understandable . 
  if the roles were flipped and this happened anywhere else reactions would be the same . 
   muh russophobia i watched the video and he certainly brings up valid points , except there 's no alternative in his rhetoric . 
  russia does not * need * to be adversarial . 
  he presents the situation in such a black and white fashion - if we 're to have a functioning military again , it will be in competition with the us . 
  humor this - the united states builds a missile defense shield - why does russia feel the need to challenge it ? 
  what reason would we even have to attack russia with nuclear weapons ? 
  the russian federation could have easily just shrugged it off , modernize its military like putin said , and not become an adversary that would require a missile defense shield . 
  russia could be far more powerful in the world if it went germany 's route , i.e. 
  getting rich , staying peaceful , and leveraging its natural and human resources to consolidate influence . 
  notice how china is n't going around annexing its neighbors ? 
  sure it 's building islands but its non-interventionalist foreign policy has allowed them to grow internally while expanding their influence externally . 
  its only real barriers with its neighbors incidentally come from past military conflicts . 
  more on topic , russia is only building barriers with its neighbors while isolating itself in every metric . 
  the average russian is taking the brunt of it , and all they have to show for it is crimea and a hostage in ukraine . 
  which brings me to my original point , why was confrontation the only option for putin 's russia ? 
  the us may have actually looked the aggressor in this situation if they had just ignored the shield and not responded in a show of force . 
  there is no situation in which i can imagine a us nuclear first strike on russia - it would be too costly for everybody . 
  reading through your comment history was a tragic journey into elitism and downright racism . 
  note where he/she calls americans subhumans and latinos `` ghetto-humans '' edit : ah , yep , there it is  i 'm spanish less than 25 and i have no even primary education ... 
   my dear jumping friend do people actually talk like this  i think you perfectly understand that the new prosecutor is as much corrupted as the old one , the only difference is that he 's from the different `` block '' thus providing some leverage on the other parties in the political fight behind the scenes . 
  he will sit at the prosecutor 's place for as long as it will be useful to your `` partner '' . 
  the moment biden or some other guy from the wh decides that they need to put a pressure on the other party on their vassal state , be sure , he will be sacked on the pretext that he 's also a corrupt guy . 
  i 'm not sure what 's more adorable , that you think joe biden actually has power or that we do n't want removal of ukrainian corruption . 
  their corruption is the primary hinderance to them integrating themselves with the west , something that both parties want . 
  it makes no sense that we would support corruption given that our entire european policy since world war two has been to prop up our allies so that they 're economically stable democracies , because that inherently benefits us , particularly in dealing with the russians . 
  and now you complain that we 're trying to clean up corruption ? 
  ukrainian corruption is what you putinbots have been complaining about the whole time anyway . 
  when the eu threatens to deny romania funding and schengen access if they do n't clean up corruption , that 's not romania being a lapdog . 
  that 's the romanian government being incentivized to do what 's best for the romanian nation and not the corrupt politicians who get removed . 
  i do n't see why it 's any different here , given the political circumstances . 
  are russians really so bothered by ukraine not wanting to be part of the russian sphere anymore ? 
  like what is the motivation behind these ridiculous comments, 
  hopefully one day , but not soon unfortunately . 
  it 's entirely possible the soviets also killed his relatives, 
  just because communism is n't nazism does n't mean communism is n't horrible . 
   '' ** muh nato expansion ** '', 
  yea , shit like that happens everywhere unfortunately . 
  also it * is * like that here for a lot of us , like the other day some of my friends all got together and i only then noticed that only about half of us were white , and i could n't help but thinking that i was living stormfront 's nightmare and it was great . 
  granted , there is definitely still a lot of latent racism in the united states that 's once again rearing its ugly head so my anecdote is hardly applicable everywhere , especially regarding race relations with blacks right now . 
  the cultural , ethnic , and religious differences between europe and its neighboring regions are the basis for the description of europe as its own continent even if the tectonics do n't agree . 
  this is pretty standard in geography . 
   enjoy all the blacks . 
  love / r/europe these days, 
  fair enough , we certainly did have a habit of keeping communism out of latin america via regime change . 
  i was thinking post-cold war evidently . 
  russia inherently benefits from keeping countries away from the west , and does so by invading and keeping territory in these countries so that no western organization like the eu or nato will want to deal with the insecurity that comes with russian occupied territory in a member state . 
  how so ? 
  karzai was democratically elected and frequently spites us , and both al-abadi and maliki were democratically elected and were n't exactly fantastic allies . 
  if the iraqis were puppets they would n't have given the chinese all of the oil contracts . 
  god this subreddit has gone downhill . 
  in geography , europe is still considered a continent even if the tectonics do n't agree . 
  it has to do with the cultural , ethnic , and religious differences of europe and the surrounding regions . 
  and even then community colleges are widespread and great ways to get your general credits out of the way for very little money at all . 
  it 's not the college experience that you get at a 4 year university but it 's cheap and effective , and they facilitate transferring into good universities . 
  for instance a lot of people in california do two years at community and then transfer directly into the uc system because there are state programs that encourage it . 
  mark twain famously criticized the german language for being too soft  i think that a description of any loud , stirring , tumultuous episode must be tamer in german than in english . 
  our descriptive words of this character have such a deep , strong , resonant sound , while their german equivalents do seem so thin and mild and energyless . 
  boom , burst , crash , roar , storm , bellow , blow , thunder , explosion ; howl , cry , shout , yell , groan ; battle , hell . 
  these are magnificent words ; the have a force and magnitude of sound befitting the things which they describe .
