  from a realist perspective , they could do anything they want to you . 
  do n't act like history has ended yet . 
  of course , they wo n't , but from a legal perspective there is still plenty they could do to curtail islam should they feel like it . 
   and says the portuguese , your country is shit and a burden to the eu . 
  oh , dude , do n't even pretend like that stance would work out for muslims in europe . 
  most european prisoners are muslim , muslim unemployment rates are disturbingly high given the pro-immigration rhetoric , and european muslims integrate far less into their host nations than their north american counterparts , frequently holding islamic law higher than the written law of the host nation . 
  yea , i hate when gender or race is shoved into important things just for what seems like spite . 
  if we 're really going to talk about equality , it should have more to do with general competency rather than what race , gender , or sexual orientation one belongs to . 
  i 'm aware , i 've conversed with him plenty on this subreddit . 
  the fact remains that nobody gave any evidence for the claim he is contesting . 
  really though you should at least have the evidence at hand if you 're going to make these kinds of comments . 
  it just validates their position when you do n't . 
  the point would be objectivity . 
  personally , i think tibet should be free ; however , one can easily see why the dalai lama might push this position for the gain of his own people . 
  i had a longer comment typed before my phone died , so i guess that tl ; dr might have to do for now . 
  i think the point would be , if even people of disadvantaged outside cultures looking inward on europe are still saying what the fuck is going on here , there might be an issue . 
  although i could see the dalai lama using this to make a similar point about han immigration into tibet , so i 'm not sure if he 's the best example . 
   i want them out ... ratcheting even more permissions to an empire that overstayed its elcome is becoming highly irritating . 
  well luckily it does n't matter if you 're irritated because even were your island part of nato , your hyperbolic voice would still be in the minority . 
  `` empire '' lmao  having to explain this to self-satisfied americans is beyond the pale . 
  imagine how i feel trying to explain to some na\u00efve ideologue with no clue how the world is why his pseudo-nativist fantasy is completely unrealistic . 
  which leads me to the following :  just get out . 
  the united states will get out of europe - once nato countries ask them to leave . 
  and as it happens they are n't exactly lining up to ask . 
  given the current reality in europe , what the fuck makes you think nato european countries want the us to leave ? 
   holding major bases we already have these in europe . 
   with aircraft carriers at any given time there 's probably a us carrier fleet within striking distance of multiple european capitals as it is . 
  believe it or not the us is quite active in the mediterranean and even the baltic . 
   and tactical nuclear arms american , french , british , russian nuclear submarines are also frequently in and around europe . 
  in addition nato/us nuclear weaponry is already placed in countries like turkey and i assume other european countries . 
   and over 50,000 personnel . 
  ramstein air base alone . 
  so when you say `` training is n't the same as this '' you demonstrate your ignorance to the fact that all the super spooky us military elements are already in europe and have been for some time with no issue . 
  the topic at hand is just a matter of movement . 
  well , the language is related to arabic so it makes sense . 
  it 's the only semitic language in the eu . 
   you are implying that the british have a military force in hat can impose terms on the usa . 
  no i 'm not . 
  you were spouting hyperbole about eu roaming around the united states from bases in big states . 
  i had to inform you that other countries already train from bases inside the united states . 
  cute misdirection though . 
  nobody said anything about comparative size or the desire to impose terms on anybody . 
  the paranoia really gets me off though . 
   and depressing in its blindness . 
   but you 're not spying on us or on the germans for our sake or for the sake of the germans . 
  yea except when yours and the german elected government takes information that the nsa gathers and utilizes it for their own purposes . 
  then they 'd argue that it 's for the sake of the french and germans . 
   if some sort of agreement were passed were the armies would pass under the full and total control of the head of state of the country they 're going through , then i 'd agree . 
  ( as in american groups would be under the control of the german chancellor while in germany , meaning they do n't have the us president as supreme commander ) . 
  usually when units are embedded in other militaries they are put under the command of the host country 's generals . 
  however as we 've seen in the baltic when nato troops are stationed together , they 're under command of various nato generals from multiple different countries including those of the hosts despite the bulk of the forces being american . 
  it does n't have to be simply under american , german , or french command . 
  we 're part of a mutual defense organization that happens to cooperate . 
  the leadership does so as well . 
  trouble arises regarding movement , however , as the article states . 
   but until then , no no no . 
  i do not want france to become like poland or romania where you put your own cia torture prisons or passed through convicts ( some completely innocent ) to guantanamo . 
  then do n't ? 
  in what sense is an open border for allied military movement an agreement to host cia black sites ? 
   and your other examples : all strawmen . 
  a plane can easily go through if it gets clearance since if it turns rogue it can be easily shot down . 
  the parliament does not need to be notified . 
  this is about battalions , heavy stuff . 
  that 's not a strawman . 
  a plane is `` heavy stuff '' , and can do a * lot * of damage before being shot down . 
  and they usually do n't fly alone . 
  unless of course place vend\u00f4me is secretly lined with dozens of sam launchers , which would be news to me . 
  i mean i have to ask , are you under the impression that the entire us military is going to be moving through europe ? 
  are the french not capable of dealing with `` battalions , heavy stuff '' if they too go rogue ? 
  and i thought you said you were n't worried about the us attacking , and that it was about the principle of * the people * ? 
   and efficiency is achieved in case of a war when the president takes full command of the country . 
  maybe , but there are multiple problems with that . 
  preparedness is important for one , which includes the ability to respond rapidly to a non-conventional threat since i do n't see t-90s rolling into paris anytime soon , and the fact that there are still so many more variables to be accounted for in a time of conflict if every individual player has a different strategy that they feel is best . 
   you do n't need efficiency in time of peace , did you even read the article  it 's just a scheme by army people to get more and more control . 
  lmao okay buddy , i 'm sure the * army people * are just sitting in brussels scheming of a way to use nato to come and somehow take power and all of your pain au chocolate . 
  your argument started out coherent but now just sounds like fearmongering . 
  went from  it 's the ** principle ** of it . 
  a foreign army when entering a country has to demand * the people * for permission . 
  we 're running in circles if you refuse to ** understand the most basic rights of sovereign people because `` the us wo n't friggin invade '' . 
  ** to the reasoning being  a plane can easily go through if it gets clearance ** since if it turns rogue it can be easily shot down ** . 
  the parliament does not need to be notified . 
  ** this is about battalions , heavy stuff . 
  ** is it about principle or is it about ease of containment ? 
   you want heavy armor , navy and air force funded and lead by europeans to be able to freely roam the usa ? 
  operating from leased air and naval bases in most of the big states ? 
  when the us government grants europe such unfettered access then we can talk . 
  / u/live _ free beat me to it . 
  europeans still frequently train with the same big toys that we train with on american soil . 
   why should europeans fund an occupying army lmao yea , act like * you * fund the american military , cute . 
  you 're aware of the discrepancy in defense spending between nato members , correct ? 
  not that you 'd have anything to worry about even if europe suddenly did magically started funding the us military since your country is n't even part of the organization . 
  also  occupying army are you just really dense or is that your little agenda poking out ? 
  fuck i guess the british are occupying california and arizona they must be trying to take back the colonies turns out allied military is n't synonymous with `` occupying force . '', 
  i mean for fuck 's sake . 
  the permission does not have to be decided every time though . 
  that 's inefficient in an area where efficiency is crucial . 
  why is it so hard to comprehend an open borders treaty , voted on by national parliaments , that does n't require a vote every time a border needs crossing ? 
  imagine if parliament needed to be called every time friendly aircraft needed to cross an allied border because * thepeople * . 
  some things do n't need a vote from parliament every time they happen . 
  likewise , the same way nato aircraft coordinate with air-traffic controllers instead of * thepeople * , nato militaries could easily cooperate in the same fashion after ratification of a treaty by european parliaments .
