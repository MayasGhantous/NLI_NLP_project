  were there a need and such thing as eu forces i 'm sure something would be worked out . 
  but as it stands there is nothing going on on the entire continent and eu forces are just smaller national forces . 
  and as such , elements like the british train in the united states frequently anyway . 
   the us gaining more political leverage than it already has inside the democratic institutions of eu countries . 
  . . by being able to be flexible with military movements ? 
   what with the war on drugs , last week i saw an abrams tank raid an amsterdam cafe for marijuana , brutal stuff man . 
  europe is free to follow its own drug policy , and countries like portugal have done so successfully . 
   anti-russia propaganda , are you fucking serious yea it 's anti-russian propaganda that russia currently occupies territory in georgia , moldova , and ukraine , and started a land war in europe . 
  wonder why european countries decided to take action about that . 
  dastardly yanks , europeans had to make decisions regarding their continent 's security !, 
   war on terror are you fucking serious europe is involved in fighting terrorism for its own reasons , if you have n't been paying attention to the news in the last few years . 
   at great cost to ourselves . 
  really ? 
  remind me what the great cost is ? 
  because so far you 've given me nothing substantial , let alone some great cost to being allied with another western country through a mutual defense pact that european countries chose to be a part of . 
  never mind that malta is n't even a part of nato so it 's hardly a fitting position for a maltese to be saying what nato should and should n't do . 
  and if there was a civilization that romans looked up to , it was certainly that of the greeks . 
   * should a people , through their democratically elected representatives decide what happens on their soil ? 
  * it 's almost like they could be able to vote for such a schengen-esque treaty . 
  it 's not like the us would go out and conquer poland if they decided they did n't want to be part of the zone . 
  well , we think that . 
  in reality we ca n't really be sure just yet . 
  they 've only really operated against ukraine and that 's only really in part . 
  we have n't seen their armor or aircraft in action . 
  nato is strong enough to beat them basically unless nukes are launched , but i do n't know if we should underestimate them just yet . 
  texas is richer but from what i understand wyoming is also dirt cheap , even more so than texas . 
  note : a lot of texas is becoming more expensive , austin in particular . 
  that said , still relatively cheap and relatively booming economy . 
  but wyoming is a better wild west . 
  pretty sure the california economy just overtook france in gdp , and of all the places i 've lived san diego has been the best , so i do n't know what you 're talkin about edit : also brazil, 
  it 's up to them to decide whether or not easier movement between armies should or should not happen . 
  that decision , however , is significant and makes a difference in how well nato is able to operate in an instance in which speed is key . 
  imagine if lithuania had to recall its parliament to decide if american troops could pass through lithuania if something were happening in narva , for example . 
  it would be too slow to make a difference in a hypothetical conflict . 
  in the same vein that it 's each nato member 's decision whether or not nato membership is in their best interest , a nato schengen would also be decided by the countries individually . 
  it seems obvious though , that from a practical perspective the benefits would outweigh the risks . 
  i highly doubt that , were a nato schengen in place , the united states would just roll between countries without telling those countries anyway . 
  the risks seem minimal . 
  so when i said `` europeans have always cared about the actions of other european countries , '' that was n't referring to history ? 
  sorry , but historically european countries have rarely ever been isolationist and have always `` meddled '' in each other 's affairs . 
  it goes back far before the us came to prominence and , here 's a shocker , often times european interests are in line with american interests . 
  i do n't think a united eu would be as much of a rival as much of a partner . 
  i do n't see the west splitting down the middle just because europe is powerful once again . 
  both would be beneficial to the organization . 
  having to have parliaments recalled before a country is eligible to cross another 's border in a defensive organization like nato is kind of ridiculous if you think about it . 
  and obviously a stronger europe would be better for everyone . 
  what exactly do you fear about the united states being able to cross borders in europe , out of curiosity ? 
  so out of curiosity what do * you * think we should do instead , aside from rolling over for russia ? 
  no , but i assume the sanctions from crimea in addition to those placed due to donbas can be used when negotiating , should negotiations ever happen . 
  and if not , it * should * at least deter russia from repeating its behavior . 
  european history is n't your strong point i take it ? 
  amazing that after 20 years russia is still the only thing supporting transnistria . 
  20 years later , russia is still just as guilty as they are in eastern ukraine . 
   lmao just because it 's been a while does n't make it any less true . 
  europeans have always cared about the actions that other european countries take . 
  as stunning as it may sound , actions outside the european union sometimes matter to the european union . 
  and not everybody is exactly fond of letting russia hold its neighbors hostage indefinitely . 
  what would russians on this sub do if they were n't so busy making themselves victims ? 
  maybe if you do n't want europeans to shit on russia , do n't invade countries in europe ? 
  try and dismiss it as a circlejerk all you want , but right now russia is an aggressor nation in moldova and ukraine , and keeps taking more territory in georgia . 
  all this despite a weak economy and low standard of living . 
  maybe once that changes , so will the amount of shit being deservedly flung at russia . 
   yeah i could , but why should i lose my time explaining citizen of hegemonic state why multipolar world is better ? 
  mutlipolar world is n't better for average western , that is for sure . 
  ( do n't pretend that you give a flying fuck about anyone else , please ) because i 'm a westerner i inherently do n't care for anybody else , got it  because west once tried to destabilize syria during multi polar world , you can ask robert fisk how it ended . 
  you may not recall , but initially the protests against assad were not because of the united states . 
  it did n't help when he started using snipers to disperse crowds . 
  we certainly funded rebel elements later , but if anybody is responsible for syria 's instability , it 's assad . 
  ask any migrant what the thing they feared the most in syria was , and they 'll tell you assad 's barrel bombs . 
   p.s which pro-soviet arab state was invaded by usa during cold war ?!, 
  britain , france , and israel took the suez canal from egypt , israel , a western ally , invaded basically all of its neighbors at some point , the government of iran was overthrown ( though they 're not arabs obviously )  because at least , you have freedom to choose your master or as one israeli intelligence official said , make them fight to death for your interests . 
  if that 's worth all the baggage that comes with it to you , then that 's fine . 
   but you will never get it and i can understand it , russians still cant understand why did we try to escape their influence after so many `` good '' they did to us . 
  i understand it just fine . 
  have a good day . 
   in multi polar world , syrian civil war would have never happened , why ? 
  civil wars happened literally constantly during the cold war , in which the world was quite multipolar . 
   what happened in iraq would have never happened why ? 
  during the cold war russia and the us both invaded countries due to their ideological leanings , among other things . 
   and most certainly , libya would still be a peaceful country now ( 5 years ago we would have read in western newspapers how pro russian dictator gaddafi , with help of russian fascists crushed pro-democratic freedom fighters . ), 
  why ? 
  literally constantly the ussr and united states used rebels to overthrow opposing governments . 
  how do you figure more fuel in the fire would create a smaller flame ? 
  you could start by answering any of these , considering you 've done nothing but deflect questions regarding your completely baseless claims . 
  you 've said nothing of substance explaining why a multipolar world would be better than a unipolar one , despite centuries of history that suggest otherwise . 
   you do realize that germany was winning the war for most of it right ? 
  so was japan . 
  until they did n't have the material to keep going after severe losses . 
  whereas the ussr and united states initially both suffered majorly at the beginning of the war , with the soviets losing ** 700,000 ** at kiev ** alone ** , yet managed to fight until the bitter end at which point they were no longer on the defensive , but capturing berlin . 
  that the germans were initially winning is a moot point over the course of a conflict . 
   a country the size of texas , after loosing ww1 , with sanctions and limits to its army , managed to conquer more than half of europe and shake the world in 4 years . 
  and look at them now ? 
  new military tactics can and will be countered and when it comes down to it , the power with the most capacity to wage war will win . 
  as is the case with the germans and japanese . 
   and they lost by a hair , even if you say the us would use the nuclear solution , good luck trying to fly a plane above any target of value , germany was not japan . 
  lol are you fucking kidding ? 
  germany lost by a hair ? 
  germany was * fucked * from the get-go . 
  you realize * why * the battle of the bulge was germany 's last stand right ? 
  because that was the literal end of their human and material resources , and they hoped that with one blow they could force a white peace .
