  russian aggression as justified by a russian . 
  does n't matter if it 's increasingly difficult to lead a good life , as long as we have land and our neighbors do n't !, 
   if you were aware of actual history , you would understand it . 
  it is easy to be the morality princess when its not happening to you and you are far away in you safe home . 
  ah , i 'm only aware of fantasy princess history , now i remember . 
  i think a better way of looking at it would be , it 's easy to see the whole picture when you are n't on either side of the event . 
   turks did n't take children from muslims by force ( if by bosnians you mean muslims ) . 
  no , by bosnians i mean citizens of what was bosnia before ottoman conquest . 
  bosnians were not always muslims , that 's a product of ottoman rule . 
   and this `` bribing officials '' i do n't believe for one second . 
  sorry , that 's just what your article told me . 
  if you do n't believe the contents of your own link , why even post it ? 
   but to argue that * forceful * taking of children to be ** slaves ** is something positive ... is nothing short of disgusting . 
  sigh . 
  i never argued that enslavement was a positive thing . 
  i 've actually been pretty adamant in my criticism of it . 
  but to deny that there were many cases of enslaved europeans rising to great places in ottoman society would be disingenuous and simply false . 
  but please , more strawman . 
   yes as i said , they could rise in government , but by then they * were n't * even serbian anymore ( or any other nation enslaved by them ) . 
  they were servants . 
  sure its better than being a peasant on the level of meat back in serbia , but that does n't mean that it was a good practice . 
  it is inhumane to take a child from a mother , and there is no arguments to say otherwise . 
  whether or not they retained their national identity , or whatever the equivalent would be in the 15th century before nationalism was really a thing , is irrelevant to the question of whether or not they were important and high ranking members of society . 
  that 's all i 'm saying . 
  enslaved devsirme had the ability to achieve great things despite the horrible means of being given the capability . 
  compare this with the slaves of basically most other cultures , and you 'll find that very very few were given the level importance that ottoman slaves were . 
   the point is , that the ottomans took smart and capable young boys to bolster their strength , they did n't do it to benefit us , nor did it ever benefit us . 
  serbians in serbia proper were `` lesser humans '' . 
  if you ca n't understand this i do n't know what to say ... 
  i 'm not sure i 'd buy into that the ottomans believed serbians to be lesser . 
  subjects , no doubt , but lesser humans would kind of disqualify them from being chosen for high governance . 
  but this is irrelevant . 
  obviously enslavement of serbs did n't help serbia proper , i 'm not arguing this . 
   hahaha so now the argument it `` thats war '' . 
  ok then lol ... the taking of slaves from africa and killing natives was also war . 
  stronger beats the weaker , suck it . 
  no , a war for independence is literally war . 
  if brits massacred americans during the american war for independence , i 'd view that as a tragic consequence of war . 
  that 's what it is . 
  kidnapping africans , and by extension europeans under ottoman yolk en masse for sale elsewhere is not . 
  that 's enslavement . 
  but again , this is an irrelevant `` point '' regardless . 
   oh yes i know , given that genocides happened upon my people continuously for the last 700 years . 
  i know quite a bit about that . 
  but interesting how you compare a genocide of 2000 people to 500 years of the same . 
  interesting indeed . 
  is n't it though ? 
  you 'd think that a people so worn from ethnic struggles would n't turn around and attempt to cleanse territory of other ethnicities , due to the horrors they faced as well . 
  it really is a tragic irony , the ethnically oppressed becomes the oppressor . 
  you try to make * 2,000 murders * sound like nothing when that 's quite a few more than were killed in some of your links . 
   nor does it mean that ** serbs ** were in positions of power . 
  ** janissaries ** were not serbs . 
  notice the fucking gigantic difference k , but slaves were . 
  that 's what i 've claimed from the beginning . 
   european identity is not synonymous with the crimes in the colonies you idiot . 
  i am european but i did n't nor did any of my ancestors have part in those happenings to say that they did would be idiotic and ridiculous . 
  this does n't make me any less european . 
  and i regard those as what they are , crimes of the worst kind . 
  but what my point was that you ca n't argue someone else 's crimes as my own hypocrisy , which you did . 
  europeans all clamor to claim a common identity when they accomplish something good , and distance themselves from that identity when they fuck up big time . 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  that 's not specific to you . 
   and here is that tu quoque argument i previously mentioned . 
  my people were indeed historically well above that behavior ( and were until the 90s ) . 
  * lmfao , you think that serbs would have behaved any differently than the rest of human beings if they were n't the ones under someone else 's boot ? 
  it only took a decade of independence to get an ethnic cleansing under your belt , what makes you think that the serbian people are any exception ? 
  americans , brits , frenchmen , germans , czechs , russians , canadians , italians , portuguese , spanish . . all have done some fucked up shit because they had the power to do so . 
  believing that your people are any different is next level na\u00efvet\u00e9 , and it 's shown . 
  & gt ; russians in world war two were so brutal to germans and german women in particular that there were mass suicide events prior to soviet `` liberation '' in order to avoid being actually raped to death . 
  whole towns . 
  history is not clean for anyone . 
   if you look up i mentioned ( up until 20th century ) , the world wars happened well after the ottomans took hold in europe ... sigh . 
  and its brutality does n't downplay the brutality of the ottomans for the love of god . 
  i realize that . 
  my point in saying that is that this level of barbarism as shown in ottoman treatment of the balkan peoples is not unique , nor is it something that has stopped since the fall of the ottomans . 
   yes the russians raped germans , but guess what the germans raped the russians too , oh also jews , serbs , polish , roma etc etc etc. 
  like i said , we 're all human , and when in positions of power it happens that entities will abuse that power . 
  earlier i spoke of belgian colonial rule , and i think that 's a perfect example of what i 'm talking about . 
  the ottomans were n't above it , serbians are n't above it , humans are shitty creatures . 
  this will be my last response i think , my liver might fail from all the tequila i 've consumed while responding to these , and this has without a doubt been one of the most pointless conversations i 've ever had on this website . 
  i feel like i should mention that i really have nothing against the serbian people , because i feel like this conversation went pretty downhill . 
  in honesty , the serbs i 've met have generally been pretty great people and i do hope that the region stabilizes and grows to its full potential , because i 'd love to spend some time there . 
  also , \u0107evapi is * fantastic * . 
  cheers . 
   did you even read what i wrote ? 
  europeans did n't do as horrible shit to ** each other ** as did the ottomans and moors to them . 
  i know what happened to africans and native americans but they are neither european nor in europe ... europeans did genocide and etc * but not in europe * is the key word here , at least not until the 20th century and not nearly on the level of ottomans ... and ** we are talking about europe here ** not the rest of the world . 
  ottomans were conquerors and of course we do n't like them , just as you do n't like us . 
  i really ca n't comprehend that you do n't understand such a simple sentence . 
  and why does it matter that europeans did n't enslave each other ? 
  that 's what i ca n't comprehend . 
  they enslaved others and it 's less of a crime that they did n't enslave other euros ? 
  as for that tidbit about me not liking you , that could n't be further from the truth . 
  i have eu citizenship and i 'm planning on coming back during university , i have european friends both here and there , and one of them is a bosnian serb living in br\u010dko . 
   this is really precious . 
  i in fact am serbian . 
  this is probably the ** biggest bullshit ** i heard my entire life on the matter . 
  i do n't recommend ever saying it in a serbians face or you will be getting serious blows to it . 
  this is honest advice . 
  like i said , i 'm good friends with a bosnian serb .
