  there is n't any need nor will to do anything in europe . 
  it 's rich , stable , and culturally significant and as long as it stays that way then everybody 's happy . 
  they have a bizarre fetish about liberating france again , which is ironic considering they elected a draft dodger, 
  way to go on a tangent there . 
  for starters , what i 've heard from prisoners is that they prefer the privatized ones , not that it matters because any federal private prisons will be unable to renew their contracts in the next two years as per a recent doj ruling . 
  of course , this has nothing to do with the topic at hand . 
  not sure , but from what i understand the pak-fa has run into some budgetary issues and production has been fairly stalled . 
  they 're also upgrading their 4th generation sukhois as well . 
  thank you , i thought i was going insane with all of these totally persecuted right wingers talking about how they were called racist nazi fascist baby killers last month on this sub , as if / r/europe has n't been completely anti-immigration since before the refugee crisis . 
  yea , we 've been seeing articles like this since at least 2014, 
  have we been on the same sub these last few years ? 
  this place was always anti-immigrant . 
  and then just switched routes when that one closed . 
  my father instructed at topgun as a soviet and then russian aircraft expert and i ca n't recall him ever saying a single thing positive about the mig . 
  also according to him the drunkest he 's ever been was when meeting with [ viktor belenko ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/viktor_belenko ), 
  yea idk what he thinks he 's going to accomplish . 
  eu goes to 2 % , is pissed about us trying to force them to do so , closes bases in germany and italy ? 
  what exactly works out for us in this situation ? 
  i 've been a longtime advocate of the eu going full 2 % but this is not the way to do it . 
  well they are making [ this ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikoyan_mig-35 ) but i 've never put too much faith in the mig over sukhoi anyway, 
  are you just throwing out random words now ? 
  the carrier 's a piece of shit . 
  and even then accidents happen . 
  my family 's lost enough friends to attest to that . 
  well , it was a different time when bush came into office . 
  at that point there was more hope for a friendly russia than there is now . 
  but georgia was kind of the final straw between russia and the west being meaningfully friendly . 
  i 'm not saying i do n't understand it . 
  i 'm just saying that europe needs unity to stay strong in the future . 
  that said , i think if the germany and france are any indication , serbia and croatia getting along is n't too outlandish, 
  well , y' all are fucked if you ca n't come together in some way . 
  china and russia will only grow and spread their influence and i do n't think that will spare small individual european nations . 
  really ? 
  trump who has similar accusations of using charity money to pay his legal fees and fund his campaign ? 
  yea i 'm sure this is why he won . 
   or working together to defend themselves from the global south lo fucking l why am i not surprised that somebody who 's recently commented `` mega '' would say this . 
   it is just that if they say so very openly then they get called racist yea , if you think you need to defend yourself from the global south then i would n't exactly be shocked if you have racist tendencies . 
  it 's amazing because the people who hold the global south in contempt simultaneously are usually the first to say that east asian immigrants are great because they assimilate . 
  because it has to be the right people from the global south apparently . 
   and that for a short while still works as a silencer . 
  but yes , it is totally self aware , it is not one country per another but a rich , civilized global north do you know what the global south refers to or are you just trolling ? 
  because last i checked the global south was still quite civilized . 
  if you 're going to talk about the global south i have to assume you 're familiar with orientalism as a concept , though i wo n't get my hopes up because you almost stereotypically exemplify orientalist mindset in that you obsess over and seek to exclude an other . 
  the way you characterize that `` other '' is exactly why people perceive you as racist - when you say that people need to protect themselves from the global south all you 're doing is using the global south as a dogwhistle and trying to create fear where it should n't exist . 
  go pick up orientalism by edward sa\u012bd if you have n't already . 
  jesus christ , the * civilized * global north . 
  what a joke . 
   trying to preserve what it was from a global south and this is what anti-globalism is all about . 
  which is why it 's a concept not held in high esteem by academics . 
  globalism as a product of globalization is inevitable . 
  and that 's fine . 
  it comes down to how nations cope with this change . 
  if you just cover your ears and scream `` lalala i ca n't hear you '' you 're probably not going to do so well . 
  but keep using less developed nations as a scapegoat , that 's fine . 
  just make sure to stay refined to the former warsaw pact countries , we would n't want anybody from less developed countries coming into our * richer * , more civilized western nations . 
  god perspective is so much fun as for the poster , he got his fucking job from a globalized world . 
  if you 're gon na fight against globalism then you have to deal with globalism . 
  if not , call a spade a spade and just say you do n't want muslims in your country . 
  but do n't hide it under `` muh global south . '', 
  lmfao , whatever you say einstein . 
  just acknowledge that this whole time you have refused to answer any questions posed that would challenge your worldview , a worldview that 's pretty outdated at this point . 
  cheers . 
  why ? 
  he 's right . 
  you would n't have been downvoted if you did n't come in here with your persecution complex . 
  notice how op is upvoted ? 
  that 's because he 's not commenting like an asshole . 
  cheers . 
   yeah its called casus belli . 
  if they tried to take more maybe someone like great britain might have stepped in . 
  so basically you played eu4 for the first time , wonderful . 
  france was the one who declared war . 
  not the germans . 
  the alsace region was irrelevant to france 's declaration of war . 
  furthermore you did n't answer my question - what is it that 's more significant about alsace that wallonie , champagne , or otherwise , to the germans ? 
  they did n't have to stop at alsace . 
  but i guess it 's just coincidence that the germans only took the ethnically german area in france , right ? 
   actually remind me what happened the last time the germans marched into belgium ? 
  not like bismark was known for any kind of realpolitik . 
  why did n't they take austria if it was to unify all german peoples ? 
  because the austro-hungarian empire was a austrian/hungarian monarchy and the [ german question ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_question ) did n't want to accommodate the other ethnic and religious groups that taking habsburg lands would have required . 
  you are n't clever , this was one of the biggest dilemmas in the formation of the german nation and kleindeutschland was the accepted path . 
  once the austrians were their own country without the habsburg monarchy and completely german , the interest in austria becoming part of germany was realized . 
  again , read a fucking book . 
  you clearly do n't understand that nationalism promotes a drive to attain resources and therefore even if you keep covering your ears and screaming `` nationalism never hurt anybody '' that does n't make you any less wrong . 
  go tell me that the balkans are the way they are because of * resources * and that slobodan milo\u0161evic was only interested in * resources * . 
  nationalism easily justifies and leads to war , plain and simple . 
  nationalism leads nations to empower their people . 
  this often comes at the expense of other peoples . 
  tell me that 's wrong . 
  why did n't germany also take wallonie then ? 
  hmm , what was it about ~ ~ elsa\u00df-lothringen ~ ~ alsace-lorraine that was appealing to the germans where luxembourg , wallonie , or champagne were n't ? 
  guess what was significant about ~ ~ elsa\u00df-lothringen ~ ~ alsace-lorraine to the german nation . 
  also , the war was n't fought over capturing that province you idiot . 
  the war was provoked to galvanize the german peoples into a single nation . 
  it was france who declared war , so i 'm not sure if you 're just trolling but i 'm pretty sure they did n't do it to capture alsace . 
  read a fucking book . 
  see edit, 
  i 'll try , it was a few days ago so i 'll have to dig for it lmfao i found [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/le_pen/comments/5cpgul/the_angel_of_verdun_vive_la_france_emily_blunt/ ) well titled post [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/le_pen/comments/5ck8g8/un_am%c3%a9ricain_qui_cherche_un_manteau_fran%c3%a7ais_ou/ ) the post in question . 
  if you wan na see something just so * so * sad , look at the comments all talking about baguettes .
