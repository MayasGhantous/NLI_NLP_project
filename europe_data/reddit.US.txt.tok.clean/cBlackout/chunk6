  i 'm quite familiar with the affinity of the balkan states to hate the turks . 
   is [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dev%c5%9firme ) how you mean ottomans `` elevated '' serbs into positions of power ? 
  by blood tax ? 
  taking 7 year old children and making them into whores and their slaves and soldiers who were bound to never marry or have land , to be their meat shield for more conquest ? 
  making them forget their names , culture and religion . 
  well i 'm so thankful to the ottomans . 
  what a wonderful practice . 
  your own article describes how the devsirme were elevated to be high ranking officials , even to the point of grand vizier , and that bosnians would bribe scouts to take their children . 
  i 'm not denying that there was local resentment and i can see that having a lasting effect on the psyche of the balkan peoples , but again , the article even says that the devsirme came to make up almost entirely the ruling class of the ottoman empire . 
  undoubtedly not every child got this social and political uplifting , but from an outside perspective it would seem as though many of the devsirme were quite important members of society . 
  it 's also worth noting that the janissary corps was one of the best fighting forces in the world , so i 'm not sure if i 'd call them meat shields . 
  rather it would probably be conscripts from africa and the levant acting as cannon fodder . 
   ah yes , i [ remember ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skull_tower ) how positive the ottoman rule was in the balkans !!, 
  it only kept us in that blissful 14th century level of prosperity for 500 years !, 
  tragic indeed , but that 's war . 
   i mean look at that fine piece of ** skull tower ** architecture !, 
  they are really the best when it comes to this , they also [ impaled ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/had%c5%bei_prodan%27s_revolt ) people who wanted them gone on roads , so everyone knew how mighty and powerful serbs were under them !, 
  wallachians famously impaled turks as well . 
  those monsters !, 
  and yet we glorify the impaler . 
   we really prospered , because ottomans would [ kill ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slaughter_of_the_knezes ) any of those pesky lords who wanted freedom and rights for serbs , ha , how silly of them !, 
  sigh . 
  it 's almost like a governing body will resort to extreme , almost genocidal measures to keep a region intact . 
  as a serb , you should know that . 
   in fact how does one even `` enslave '' then `` elevate into power '' ?!, 
  if you are talking about janissaries getting positions in the government , then yes , you could happen to be * born * serbian and get to work for the people who enslaved you indeed . 
  but after the treatment of brainwashing and changing of your name your religion you are no longer serbian , but turkish . 
  none of there viziers ever did good to serbia , they were simply ** too young ** to even remember it . 
  well , you pretty much just answered your own question , although the article you posted earlier did a good enough job of that . 
  just because they did n't hold onto their serbian tradition in doing so does not mean that they 're any less in positions of power , despite how tragic it is that they lost that identity . 
   and btw ... why the fuck should i talk about crimes that * western europeans * committed when i had no part whatsoever in it , as did n't most of eastern/central europe . 
  i did n't have any part of the forced marches that americans put natives through , but that does n't mean i ca n't have a semblance of remorse for it . 
  i guess european identity is only a valid concept when it 's convenient , otherwise to hell with the other europeans . 
   to me the ottomans are the single worst occurrence in my history who did ** indeed partake in mass rape/murder and enslaving ** i never denied that ottomans raped or took slaves . 
  rather , i 'm stating that europeans are n't really in a place to criticize those actions and act as if they 're historically above that behavior . 
  russians in world war two were so brutal to germans and german women in particular that there were mass suicide events prior to soviet `` liberation '' in order to avoid being actually raped to death . 
  whole towns . 
  history is not clean for anyone . 
   and of course i would have loved if they had never existed or set up on my country . 
  i completely understand that sentiment . 
  i think that the balkan area could really shine if it did n't have all of the historic problems that it has had . 
  yugoslavia offered a glimpse of that , but that 's gone . 
   this is n't to say that i hate the turks of today , but their empire was the death of my country in many ways , the remnants of those days are still felt today and will be for god knows how long . 
  and i personally do hope your country recovers , though i know it will . 
  no no , only africans in the 10s of millions . 
  estimates of 10-15 across the atlantic , and estimates of up to 15 million deaths in the congo alone from forced labor and its effects on the country . 
  and if i were a gambling man , i 'd bet figures in other colonial nations were pretty similar . 
  but i guess they do n't matter , because when it 's an ottoman enslaving a serb and elevating him into a position of power , that 's horrible and something to talk about . 
  but a euro enslaving an african , hoping he makes the boat ride across the atlantic so that you can sell him , and then having him work himself to death in a field in the americas , that does n't matter because it 's not a european ? 
  remember kids , europeans did n't take part in mass rapes and slavery . 
  except when they did , but who cares ? 
   [ it 's not like byzantinee was completely ignored ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crusade_of_varna ) . 
  hell , one of our most promising kings [ lost his life , while trying to halt the turkish advance . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_varna ) no of course not . 
  but the logistical capabilities of european states at the time made a proper reconquest of constantinople a very difficult task , and as such it was never accomplished . 
   maybe the hypotetical conquest of italia would be at reversed at some point , but that in iberia it took about 700 years , it 's not entirely certain . 
  either way , luckily it never happenned . 
  well , muslims did hold sicily , malta and some more of the european mediterranean , and those were retaken . 
  still , once carolingians turned their attention to spain it was a downhill spiral for the spanish muslims . 
   great city , but sadly not european anymore . 
  again , good for turks . 
  well , i 've talked to greeks who say they visit the city somewhat often , but i guess i 'll just put a pin in that . 
   oh , but i know that . 
  in fact , i recall i even wrote posts claiming it a month or two ago , you could likely find them somewhere in my posting history . 
  well when you say that turkic steppe peoples settled there it kind of contradicts that . 
  i 'd wager that turks with actual turkic ancestry are a minority . 
   ... just that does n't really mean anything . 
  african americans are genetically mostly descendants of subsaharan african tribes . 
  does n't mean there 's much connection between them nowadays . 
  that 's because most of them do n't actually know where they 're from . 
  it 's hard to have a sense of belonging when you have no identifier other than the massive continent of africa . 
  plus , african americans are an ocean away . 
  genetic greeks are only the bosporus away . 
  i see what you 're saying , but i think the comparison is off . 
  they 're still technically europeans though , just not speaking a european language is what i 'm saying . 
  christian europeans absolutely took part in both of those things . . who are you kidding ? 
  and ottoman slavery often led to the slaves being uplifted into positions of power , or put into the jannisary corps whereas european slavery involved working on plantations . 
  and as for rapes , europeans raped just as much as their muslim contemporaries . 
  even during world war two europeans raped germans en masse , unless russians and ukrainians are n't european anymore . 
  and have you never heard of the rape of the sabines ? 
  one of the most important cities in the history of the world was founded on rape , or at least fabled to . 
   it just * seems * impossible , because the fact that rome just is there seems like something obvious and taken for granted . 
  similarly , in a world where turks never took constantinople and it remained greek , any implication that it could happen would appear as absurdal as culturally arabic rome . 
  sorry , highly improbable to the point of near impossibility . 
  rome would be insanely difficult for a muslim force to hold , because it would have been within easy marching distance from spanish , french , german and magyar states , all of which were devoutly catholic at the time . 
  constantinople falling was problematic because it was too far away for many of the larger kingdoms to consider marching an army to at the time , and on top of that , it was formerly orthodox and catholics would n't feel the same fervor as in the rome scenario . 
  it 's worth noting that crusades were n't exactly a successful option in the case of constantinople . 
  i consider both rome and constantinople to be similarly important to the european history , and would deeply grieve over the loss of either . 
  i 'm glad that throughout centuries europe lost only * one * of them ( and that similar to the turkish conquest of anatolia and balkans arabic conquest of iberia was ultimately reversed ) . 
  why do you consider constantinople/istanbul lost ? 
  it 's a great city . 
   i never said anything about ethnic cleansing ( well , turks already got rid of the remaining original inhabitiants of constantinople in the [ greek genocide of 1920s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) , but that 's not the point ) , turks won , europe lost , good for them . 
  i 'm just sad that the central asian turkic tribes had out of all places chosen to settle in such important to european culture place 600-700 years ago . 
  that 's all . 
  sigh . 
  like i said , anatolian turks are largely greek genetically . 
  [ read . ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_history_of_the_turkish_people ) . 
  and i guess i should have been more clear with what i meant by the malta comment . 
  do you consider the island of malta `` lost '' too , seeing as it does n't speak a european language , and has a culture heavily influenced by both muslim and christian influences ( just like turkey ) ? 
  and perhaps if spain had kept it 's muslim population it would n't have had such an embarrassing history , but we 'll never know .
