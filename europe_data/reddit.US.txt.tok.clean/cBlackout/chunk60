  these are people who want to change french society yet completely view it as a caricature . 
  unfortunately foreign policy decisions very frequently affect domestic issues . 
  please , justify the german wars of unification and particularly the franco prussian war . 
  are you fucking kidding ? 
  that 's beautiful . 
  they pretend to care about your country but i doubt they 'll actually go out of their ways to learn anything about it . 
  i already watched your last video . 
  was n't impressed . 
  fact of the matter is that `` this attitude is exactly why trump won '' is just a convenient way of deflecting criticism . 
  i saw a great post on / r/le _ pen in which an american working in france was wondering how he could help shut down the globalist forces in france . 
  not even a shred of self awareness . 
  i 'm aware , but it 's worth recognizing the capabilities that europe has and how they have a lot of potential that is simply more reason not to turn our backs on them . 
  if europe is * forced * to start militarizing because some asshole with no foreign policy experience wo n't fulfill his nato obligations , the us will certainly get the cold shoulder which is obviously not great for the us . 
   i love these downvotes you 're quite the martyr, 
  oh boy , [ this chickenshit argument again ] ( http://imgur.com/krjhffu ) trump did n't win because conservatives had their fee-fees hurt by those meanie liberals . 
  they talk about how hateful people have been to them whilst shoving under the rug how t_d was essentially a hate sub the entire campaign . 
  no , trump won because gullible workers in the rust belt thought that trump could revitalize their areas . 
  why ? 
  trump supporters would be under putin 's desk giving him sloppy toppy in a heartbeat if they could . 
  do n't let the dogwhistle `` getting along with russia '' fool you into actually believing they mean anything other than being putin 's gimp . 
  the fact of the matter is that putin is an experienced former kgb agent and leader of the russian federation for quite some time whereas trump is an impressionable * decent * businessman who has appointed people like paul manafort into his political affiliation while saying that he wants `` the best people '' whilst having literally no experience in politics , and especially no exposure to international politics . 
  at this point , russia could say whatever the fuck they wanted and the alt-right and identarian movement would would gobble it up and regurgitate it at / r/the _ donald . 
  it seems like a difficult situation because the city basically relies on tourism but obviously the city ca n't become entirely tourists, 
  probably because that goes completely against our entire foreign policy and would isolate us on a global stage . 
  europe completely has the capacity to rival or overtake us militarily if they 're given the incentive . 
  if we isolate ourselves we wo n't have the military capacity for much longer . 
  but hey , muh globalization right ? 
  not criticizing but just asking , is freedom of religion necessarily an explicitly western value ? 
  i know it 's imperative to american culture but have n't western politics been heavily shaped by religious disputes , even in modern times ? 
  for example northern ireland vs the republic of ireland ? 
  so just to be clear , chechnyans deserve to be part of russia on account of their use of terrorist attacks , and south ossetia and abkhazia also deserve to be part of russia on account of their lack of terrorist attacks, 
  i love how this is always the fallback argument , and even then it 's still wrong . 
  if russia did n't take the moral high ground they would n't need to blatantly lie about their intentions . 
  like the whole `` muh crucified ethnic russians '' thing in ukraine . 
  they absolutely take the moral high ground , and even if they did n't it still would n't excuse their actions , just like it should n't excuse anybody else 's . 
  is your answer a yes or a no ? 
  i believe they 're supposed to attract expats who might want a piece of home while working in china , but as far as i know they 've been largely unsuccessful even amongst normal chinese, 
  if the united states had started arming chechnyans to the teeth so that the russians could n't retake grozny , would you have supported the chechnyans in their independence struggle ? 
  as is russia ? 
  you realize that russia criticizing kosovo 's right to independence but then backing secessionist movements in moldova , ukraine , * georgia * , etc. 
  on grounds of `` their right to choose '' is inherently hypocritical as well , right ? 
  unfortunately i think it 's just a product of the french political system , since in the first round everybody is pretty vitriolic towards all of the other candidates but then have to rally around the run-off candidates in the second round and then go back to their previous affiliations once the election has passed . 
  a lot of my friends there told me that they simply put in blank ballots for the primaries as protest , and after fillon was out of the picture a * lot * of his supporters either voted for macron to stop le pen or put in blank ballots . 
  while i prefer the french system by far to the american system it does n't seem like it leads french people to really support the president , which has its pros and cons . 
  that said , presidents like hollande clearly demonstrate a failure to appease even his own party . 
  and unfortunately even then french people today do n't really like napoleon because he was a dictator , despite liking louis xiv do n't really know how they feel about napoleon iii though, 
  who was the last french president to finish his term with a positive approval rate ? 
  also states do change their minimum wages away from the federal minimum . 
  california for example has a minimum wage of $ 10.50 / hr currently and will soon be $ 11, 
  okay , and how much of that do you see in this thread ? 
  you want to talk about european values and say that you would n't even want to be in the same vicinity of an entire religious group , i have to wonder what post-war european values mean to you . 
  but yea , saying that `` there 's a reason x minority group is n't liked '' always ends well, 
  yea ya know i guarantee you that they wo n't ban somebody because their last name is moreau . 
  you 're defending a gym that is banning people because of their ethnic backgrounds . 
  you are , by definition , a racist . 
  if that bothers you , maybe do n't support banning people based on their ethnic backgrounds . 
  you did n't answer the question . 
  really makes ya wonder why it 's being posted here right now, 
   i do n't care about their skin color or race - it is all about what they do . 
  is this why you support an establishment that is banning people with `` immigrant backgrounds ? '', 
  what do you suppose immigrant background refers to in this situation ? 
   so , do n't label me racist . 
  i 'm probably more liberal than you because at least i try to understand people as an owner of that gym while you just call him racist . 
  believable . 
  that does n't make you liberal , that 's the same bullshit that racist southerners would spout off defending establishments that would n't allow blacks in the 60s . 
  do you think that american black people should be able to be banned from establishments due to the fact that they have a higher crime rate than other racial groups in the us ? 
  after all , * its about what ** they ** do *, 
  to preface , i think that europe should be very strict about policing its borders , and i would n't mind seeing a significant reduction in unskilled laborers immigrating to europe . 
  nobody is obligated to be let into europe unless they are fleeing persecution , in which case they should be accommodated appropriately according to eu law . 
  ** however ** , it 's fucking ** unbelievable ** that people have gotten to the point where they will advocate banning people based on their `` immigration background '' ( ie skin color ) from establishment . 
  i feel pretty shitty about the direction my country is headed , but at least i know that we do n't have to deal with people being denied entry to establishments just because they are n't white or asian . 
  like am i going fucking crazy or are these people one step away from advocating muslims wear crescents on their sleeves ? 
  / u/memo _ shel , what 're your thoughts on muslims wearing crescents for identification ? 
  when you start discriminating on ethnic lines , you literally are a racist . 
  how do you not understand that ? 
  quit acting like you 're the victim for saying brown people should n't be allowed to work out at the gym . 
  literally [ this ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/224/317/fc5.jpg ) is what you sound like . 
  now i 'm not trying to flame here but who is being extreme from the left side ? 
  is not discriminating against ethnic minorities suddenly become full communism or something ? 
  what the fuck happened to this sub ? 
   stanford god i hate when people with different ideas from poorer countries take spots from americans, 
  we 've clearly seen a lot of that in germany have n't we, 
  i looked it up and page 21 of [ this poll ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2014/05/pew-global-attitudes-ukraine-russia-report-final-may-8-2014.pdf ) says that 55 % of russians polled agree that it is a great misfortune that the soviet union no longer exists , unfortunately, 
  i know , when you bring up things like katy\u0144 they say `` that was the soviet union , not russia , and did n't ya know that stalin was from georgia ? '', 
  but a majority of russians now have positive opinions about stalin , i 've seen plenty deny the katy\u0144 massacre outright , and they get upset when you tear down soviet monuments . 
  it 's pretty clear that they have positive views about the ussr but are quick to use `` well russia is n't the ussr '' as a way of denying responsibility for actions in the past , but i guarantee a majority of russians wish the ussr never fell . 
  i honestly found arma iii 's premise very refreshing . 
  a strong and conventional middle eastern faction in a game was a nice break from the usual non western faction, 
  they 're the first to scramble to tell you that russia is n't the soviet union , except for the fact that they 're the successor state to the soviet union and evidently get upset when you remove things that glorify the soviet union, 
   ** our ** * american stupidity * do us all a favor and speak for yourself next time, 
   triggered much ? 
  ironic  because you know you 're talking rubbish . 
  if it helps you sleep at night , our children will outlive yours . 
  irrelevant to the topic at hand ; the fact that this is your response only proves the irony in your above statement  europeans can open tinder when travelling in any third world country and get all the best swipes , whilst americans have to put canadian flags on their pics and still ai n't getting swipes . 
  okay 1 ) what are you 12 ? 
  2 ) you 're basing your game on success in third world countries ? 
  what does that say about how you do in the first world ? 
  3 ) never actually knew any americans that hid their nationalities , and i can tell you from experience that americans in europe have no trouble getting with europeans if you 're going to go on a wild shitposting tangent because you got butthurt about somebody talking poorly about the eu you should at least make it about something other than your tinder game in the third world . 
  how do you expect a ) libya to effectively police its border when it 's still in the process of picking up its own government b ) the problem to go away when the aforementioned crippled state wo n't be able to deal with the people being ( illegally ) forced into their country c ) people to just get back into libya and just think `` oh well i guess that did n't work i guess i 'll just go home ! '', 
  i guess i ca n't say i 'm surprised that people here think that `` who cares '' is a better or even different foreign policy than what 's currently the status quo , just like i wo n't be surprised when the problem does n't go away because people like you do n't want to actually do anything more than put a bandaid on the problem .
