  in what way is a direct quote from your own source regarding the topic at hand unrelated . 
  please , dumb it down for me , oh pinnacle of human intelligence . 
   let me dumb it down even more for you , since it 's apparently not accessible to every simple mind : who hurt you ? 
  why are you such a prick ? 
   israel occupies an area 20 % larger than it is supposed to : 74 % of area c , as opposed to 61 % of area c . so when you said that israel considers zone c 20 % larger than the rest of the world does , you understand that that is not synonymous with what they occupy ? 
  as explained by the excerpt from your source , which clearly states that the formal designation as to what zone c actually is , remains 63 % . 
   this is possible because israel includes lands that do not belong to area c in its official land partition ( `` including annexed east jerusalem , ** no-man 's land ** and the palestinian part of the ** dead sea ** '' ) . 
  compelling argument . 
   ~ ~ this is middle school material , seriously . ~ ~ i do n't know what the word pretentious means !, 
  they 're already in a precarious position and the risks outweigh the benefits at the moment i would imagine . 
  they already have conflicts to tend to . 
  the point is that they could , and if they decided to it would be difficult to stop them taking those three countries . 
  because they do n't . 
  they 're certainly wealthy enough , but they could n't care less , as evidenced by this thread . 
  everybody who is n't directly threatened by another country seems to be under the impression that because of that , they do n't need to care about their military . 
  meanwhile , the baltics are completely vulnerable but since it 's estonia , not germany under threat , apathy will continue to reign supreme and the us wo n't be able to commit all of its resources to the pacific where they are needed . 
  the theory is that russia could invade the baltics in under two days before nato could appropriately respond , by which time the russians would have dug in and the west would have to decide whether or not they were willing to lose a lot of lives over the baltic states . 
  it 's not a threat to all of europe ( now ) but it 's a very realistic threat to some of the eu 's member states that is being completely disregarded by the larger countries in the union . 
   as of 2013 , area c formally comprised about 63 % of the west bank , including settlements , outposts and declared `` state land '' . 
  [ 1 ] from your source . 
  not only are you a pretentious asshole , but you also are n't quite as smart as you seem to believe you are . 
  just in general . 
  for perspective , all i asked was where you got the 20 % statistic to which you responded with a snide insult to my intelligence simply because i questioned where you got the number . 
  comical . 
  it 's worth noting that i also disagree with israeli presence in the west bank . 
  i just do n't see you being objective with your statistics . 
  what the fuck are you even talking about, 
   just another 3 bill added to the already insane amount the us gives israel in '' aid '' all the time . 
  ah , billion . 
  yea maybe next time do n't confuse trillion and billion , the words sound similar but there 's actually quite a difference between them . 
   and i like how noone said ` the jews control everything ' but you slipped it in there anyways , you literally blamed the fact that the united states gives israel aid money on the jewish lobby . 
  no , they did n't . 
  they got there after all of their neighbors invaded them with the intent of destroying them . 
  upon losing this war jews were expelled en masse from the arab world from places that they had lived for extremely long periods of time . 
   israel started with a peace deal massively slanted in their favour because they repeatedly won wars that allowed them to have that bargaining chip ? 
  why would the arabs be given an equal position at the negotiating table if they have no leverage . 
  if the arabs had had the leverage , the israeli state would have ceased to exist . 
  but they did n't . 
   and made `` concessions '' by giving palestinians what any reasonable person believes should be theirs to begin with . 
  are the 1967 borders unreasonable ? 
  nothing is ever good enough for the palestinians/arabs . 
  the israelis are not going anywhere . 
  they could have stayed at the 1949 borders , but peace was rejected by the arabs . 
  then , the arabs invaded again . 
  once again , being defeated . 
  these wars spawned hundreds of thousands of refugees who went to jordan , where they then attempted to overthrow the jordanian government . 
  i 'm not saying that israel should be in the west bank . 
  but i 'm not sure what else you want . 
  the dismantling of the israeli state ? 
  yea , no . 
   the us even admits that this was the process they undertook , that israel would n't even come to the table unless the starting point was so far from acceptability that they could spend a year making concessions and still not have a workable peace deal . 
  point me to that instance ? 
  cute analogy , but it only extends to burglary . 
  unfortunately , territory does n't quite work that way . 
  just ask germany . 
  that information is not in your source , where do you get the 20 % statistic ? 
  they have in the past and the palestinians repeatedly rejected any and all peace offers because they did n't take enough territory from the israeli state, 
  source that the united states is giving a seventh of its gdp to israel because the jews literally control everything ? 
  / r/europe is overwhelmingly pro-eu until americans decide to support a stronger eu , at which point the entire sub devolves into defensive eurosceptics who ca n't stand the idea of somebody else wanting a united europe . 
  obama should just step out and say `` fuck the eu '' and you 'd be a superstate by noon . 
   `` european countries should continue to rely on our military indefinitely '' \\* the eu invades and annexes belarus , russia , and ukraine *, 
   thank is exactly the attitude that makes american food taste like shit and be covered in corn oil or whatever that disgusting crap you use is . 
  lol , remember , literally * all * of our food tastes like shit , and if it does n't come with a shot of corn syrup i ai n't eating it . 
  is it really a common perception across the pond that american food does n't taste good ? 
  because that would be pretty comical . 
  watching the shitshow unfold over * cheese * is just incredible . 
  did we recently annex new zealand and australia and nobody told me ? 
  also , the runner up and third place overall were from switzerland and the netherlands , respectively . 
  it certainly does n't seem like it . 
  i think there are some protections , and some exist locally in the united states ( ie tennessee bourbon whiskey ) but i 'm pretty sure that producers in the united states are for the most part free to label things as mozzarella , for example . 
  oh i do n't doubt it at all , they make some amazing stuff over there . 
  i just think it 's funny , given the absurd defensive reaction provoked by europeans losing a * cheese contest * . 
  it looks like non-europeans are becoming better at making european food than natives . 
  this is a good nitpick . 
  we just put * literal vomit * in our cheese , whiskey , beer ( it 's the other ingredient , the first is water ) , cheese , healthcare , cheese , chocolate , vomit , tea ( which is all arizona ) , produce , and of course , pizza . 
  are you kidding ? 
  these are your representatives lambasting a foreign politician . 
  do n't try to downplay it . 
  i never claimed that cameron told people who to vote for . 
  you keep repeating it like you have a point . 
  the fact of the matter is that british politicians are doing the same thing here in taking a definitive side on another country 's affairs . 
  [ because this is appropriate , particularly given that trump has a chance to be the president . 
  ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/19/politics/uk-parliament-trump-debate/ ), 
  british politicians have been ragging on trump . 
  while it may be warranted , we have british politicians sticking their noses into an american campaign , smearing an american politician . 
  nobody gave a shit . 
  maybe you just have thin skin . 
  something felt off recently , i did n't realize it had been so long since we 'd had a food circlejerk thread . 
  fun fact : in 2014 a japanese whiskey beat the scottish entries in a competition . 
  such injustice . 
  well thanks for that irrelevant agenda spreading, 
  yes , and i answered accordingly . 
  to which you responded  are you saying prostitution is not forbidden in islam ? 
  which is not even close to what we were discussing . 
  and even if it were , forbidding or looking down on prostitution is not unique to islam either . 
  now you 're just shifting the goalposts . 
  we were talking about virginity tests , not prostitution . 
  you claimed that virginity tests were specific to islam , and you were wrong . 
  can you point me to the hadith that says `` female police officers must be tested for virginity ? '', 
  but sure , let 's ignore the fact that a quick [ google search ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/virginity_test ) dictates that it 's performed by subsaharan africans such as the zulu and bantu , as well as in india before their government banned it .
