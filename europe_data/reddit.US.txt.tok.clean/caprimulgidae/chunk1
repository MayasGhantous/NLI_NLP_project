i think it 's a rule of the sub to only use the actual headline . 
  this issue is why i subscribed to this sub . 
  i have a feeling that 10 years down the road , this will be the news story that matters most of 2015 . 
  i 'm torn between disapproval and admiration . 
  that 's clever . 
  evil , but clever . 
  we have 11 million undocumented ( illegal ) immigrants in the country right now . 
  some overstayed visas , but many walked across the border . 
  never underestimate the willingness of the american government to put up with things that are in the interests of big business : /, 
  oh , yes they would ... 
  is the plane supposed to be bombing someone ? 
  because that 's clever , but bless your heart , that 's not what bombs look like . 
  thanks for the information . 
  i learn more from the comments on r/europe than i do from the press . 
  can you give us a tl ; dw ? 
  best gif ever, 
  in the quotes i saw , he was thanking people for congratulating him on getting to germany or for complimenting him on his ama or english skills . 
  wow , the entitlement is strong . 
  you guys , he earns that welfare by taking * free language courses * . 
  on a whim , i decided to do a word search on `` thank . '', 
  he never thanks anyone for their hospitality or charity ( and he has plenty of opportunities -- many of the commenters are german ) . 
  he does , however , thank people for giving him reddit gold . 
  most of these are easier to remember if you know what the individual letters mean . 
  for example , c - carrier v - fixed-wing aircraft ( as opposed to helicopters ) n - nuclear-powered l - light ... and so forth . 
  btw , `` k '' stands for `` killer '' which has become a defunct hull designator in the u.s. , which i think is too bad . 
  the `` g '' means they carry guided missiles . 
  so i suppose it depends on how the spanish have them armed . 
  after the cold war we converted some of our ohio class submarines from carrying ballistic missiles to guided missiles , thus ssbn -  ssgn . 
  it 's the island equivalent of those [ box-shaped japanese melons ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1390088.stm ) . 
  yeah . 
  it seems like the money spent per life saved/improved ratio would be better . 
  i thought `` dutch '' specifically meant `` from holland '' and holland was only * part * of the netherlands and you were n't supposed to use it to refer to the whole country . 
  anyway , my apologies on that . 
  i wonder that , too . 
  and not only would it be more doable , would it be * fairer * , since the aid would be reaching more people ? 
  ( the u.s. has spent $ 4.3 billion since 2011 . 
  we could probably afford to spend more , too . ), 
  really ? 
  you 'd be ok with sending `` manpower '' to defend syrian `` land and sacred places '' ? 
  i hate to be jaded and cynical , but you have no idea what you 'd be getting into . 
  first , you 'd be in a proxy war with russia and iran . 
  it would be harder than it looks . 
  netherlandish casualties would rise . 
  if you changed your mind and decided to pull out , it would look like you 'd lost a war . 
  oh , and if you accidentally killed any civilians , your homegrown muslim population back in the netherlands would riot against your government . 
  assuming you succeed and you oust assad , then what ? 
  you 'd try to establish a democracy in syria , but insurgents would keep fighting you and each other . 
  you ca n't pull out -- the country will descend back into chaos . 
  but you ca n't stay in because by this point the war is deeply unpopular in the netherlands . 
  sounds like an interesting premise for a novel : `` it 's 2150 . 
  over a hundred years ago , europeans got fed up with europe , bought kamchatka from russia , and established an outpost of european culture on the shores of the sea of okhotsk ... '', 
  i feel the same way . 
  i certainly care . 
  but i do n't want to get sucked into a war with russia . 
  and beyond the self-interest , i think in a nato-russia war you would see those casualty rates go up by an order of magnitude ( or two ) . 
  this seems like the sort of argument we could solve with y-chromosome or mitochondrial dna tracing . 
  i 'll bet someone has , actually . 
  [ from september 2014  ( http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/29/politics/poll-americans-back-airstrikes/ )  seventy-three percent of americans back the joint u.s. and ally airstrikes , but support drops to 50 % if the mission had been undertaken solely by the united states . 
  support for intervention in syria has edged up since then , but support for ground troops [ was still under 50 % this august  ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/21/politics/obama-approval-rating-poll/ )  overall , 47 % favor sending u.s. ground troops into combat operations against isis forces in iraq or syria . 
   in the odoxa poll , 61 percent said they would back france taking part in a coalition sending ground troops to syria to fight islamic state . 
  wow . 
  americans are generally supportive of air strikes in syria , but not ground troops . 
  somewhat surprising to see the french being more gung-ho about boots on the ground than we are . 
  what would the end goal of france 's involvement be ? 
  occupy syria themselves ? 
  surely not . 
  leave it in the control of assad ? 
  in the control of some other group ? 
  which one ? 
   how in hell do they do this ? 
  like , wtf if every couple raises 4 kids , the population doubles every generation . 
  just say you identify as the leader of sweden and you need the whole country to be your safe space . 
  come to sweden , where the government will force blonde women to wait on you !, 
  i 'm sure that would n't attract ~ ~ people ~ ~ men immigrating for all the wrong reasons ... 
  what do you want to bet the cathedral will go dark * now * , even though it never went dark for the 500 + nye victims ? 
  these are men who have been raised to believe that muslims are superior to non-muslims and men are superior to women . 
  people do n't willingly part with ideologies that put them at the top of the totem pole . 
  the us one is the most newsworthy . 
  i mean , are n't we all curious to learn how it made its way from naples , fl to syria ? 
  dude , have n't you heard ? 
  isis loves borders . 
  that 's why they 're an apocalyptic islamic cult that does n't believe in them . 
  well , he was stopped at a checkpoint trying to get back to belgium . 
  so , this is n't pc , but ... profiling : `` please step this way to answer a few questions , sir . 
  would you like some coffee while you wait . 
  we just need to get some sniffer dogs over here to see if this car has ever held explosives ... '', 
  shooting a plane is tantamount to killing the pilot because they frequently do n't survive being ejected . 
  if we were in court , it would definitely qualify as `` shooting with intent to kill '' . 
  i would argue that moral responsibility of integration rests on the immigrant . 
  being allowed to immigrate to a new country is a privilege , not a right . 
  if your host country decides to help you integrate , that 's extremely kind of them , but the responsibility still rests on the immigrant himself . 
  if austria closes its border , croatia will obviously have to stop shuttling . 
  the refugee game is a bit of musical chairs . 
  nobody want to be the last to close borders . 
  that 's why you want to * ability * to do it overnight . 
  if the countries north of you secure * their * borders , the migrant train will screech to a halt in your country and it will become your problem , * fast * . 
  vote for whoever will secure the border . 
  the other problems are real , absolutely , but fixable in the next election cycle . 
  hopefully there will be a thread about the election results . 
  migrants on welfare are n't going to do much for your economy .
