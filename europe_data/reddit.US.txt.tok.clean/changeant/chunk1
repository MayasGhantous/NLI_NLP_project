cool picture !, 
  i was expecting something more like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tdo1lw5.jpg ) . 
  / unjerk thank you !, 
  / rejerk how 's atlantic city this time of year ? 
  this , so much this !, 
  obviously this man is a product of america 's [ pour education system ] ( http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013-14/world-ranking/institution/harvard-university ) . 
  obama probably learned to country the same place [ dan quayle learned to word ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dan_quayle#.22potatoe.22 ) . 
  maybe enclose it so you can ride your four wheeled motored bicycle in all weather ? 
  i always eat my kraft singles on wonder bread and wash them down with a nice american adjunct lager . 
  for dessert ? 
  hershey kisses . 
  i eat that meal roughly 12 times a week . 
  friday nights i 'll spring for a whopper extra value meal ( super sized ) , saturday nights i treat myself to olive garden . 
  some people eat to live , i like to say that i live to eat . 
  maybe you could afford to replace that screen door on your submarine . 
  agreed , it 's like we just moved away to college from our conservative parents house and thought `` hmmm , that wine cooler i drank last night was pretty good , i wonder if anyone has any crystal meth ... '' although in my experience the uber hop thing topped out a few years ago , the last couple of years has been a focus on barrel aged 10 % -15 % abv beers and recently sours/wild ales ... we are still taking it to extremes though , for better or worse ... 
  misunderstood who your comment was directed towards . 
  my mistake . 
  was trying to play up the stupid american stereotype while pointing out the ignorant people do n't realize europe is n't a single nation circle jerk that can happen on here from time to time . 
  guess i missed the mark . 
  they are flairless , if they had us flair they would be downvoted to oblivion for being so condescending while if they had eu flair the same comment would be upvoted for being able to point out the shortcomings of their own area . 
  people do n't know how to react . 
  jesus , when will these idiots realize europe is n't a single entity and stop referring to it as such . 
  do n't they realize europe is a vast multicultural patchwork of unique snowflake countries ?!?!, 
  would it have been so hard to write :  `` australia , belgium , chechnya , denmark , finland , france , west germany , grease , ireland , italy , luxembourg , netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , spain , sweden , swiss miss , & united kingdom 's mars missions ` on track ' : australia , belgium , chechnya , denmark , finland , france , west germany , grease , ireland , italy , luxembourg , netherlands , norway , poland , portugal , romania , spain , sweden , swiss miss , & united kingdom 's plans to explore mars with a satellite in 2016 and a rover in 2019 have taken a big step forward with the signing of new industrial contracts '' . 
  was that so difficult ? 
  edit : not sarcastically referring to op as an idiot , but the bbc . 
  dude , have you seen the prices at [ liquiteria ] ( http://www.liquiteria.com ) though ? 
  it 's like 10 fuckin bucks for a cold pressed juice . 
  death to those juice prices . 
  more like saying you 're going to vermont when you 're really going to new hampshire ... but yeah ... 
  talk about burying the lede ... 
  my old man is a retired public school teacher . 
  he taught shop/woodworking/industrial arts , whatever you want to call it , in a small rural school district ( `` town '' population roughly 100 ) in one of those red states . 
  i 've never really spoke with him about it but he kept a paddle displayed prominently in his classroom , i doubt he used it much , probably more of a preventative thing . 
  i remember he felt he was being compassionate because his paddle did n't have holes drilled in it . 
  he left the small rural district and started teaching in a larger district ( population of 150k + ) in the same state in the late 80 's early 90 's . 
  the paddle did n't make the move . 
  i graduated high school in 2001 from what i would consider a medium sized rural town ( 10k population , about 300 people in my graduating class ) . 
  i do n't know of a single first or second hand instance of corporal punishment being used at school . 
   plenty of clay in the sea [ china ? 
  is that you ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35031313 ), 
  yeah , this whole post is really going against one of my favorite / r/europe circlejerks . 
  makes me sad on the inside . 
  they attribute this to a specific show called eastenders . 
  i doubt this is something they go through every single night and in actuality i would wager they only have to deal with it during pivotal episodes of eastenders . 
  according to wikipedia the show can have over [ 15 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastenders#ratings ) viewers . 
  the population of the uk is around [ 63 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demography_of_the_united_kingdom#population ) . 
  damn near 25 % of the ... nation ( kingdom ? 
  union ? 
  realm ? ), 
  watching the same program . 
  crazy . 
  also , this is from [ a program that aired in 2008 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/britain_from_above ) , dvr and vod were n't as prevalent back then ( at least not in the states , i would assume the same can be said for the uk considering the iplayer had only launched a few months earlier ) . 
  i would be interested to know if this is still an issue for them . 
   north america also includes mexico . 
  typical european ignorance . 
  i do n't fault / u/smsjohnson i blame the education system and the fact that most europeans could n't care less about what goes on in the world outside of their back yard . 
  such an ignorant inward looking people , can we really be surprised by the rise of the likes of farage and le pen ? 
  yes , and good luck keeping that foam in front of your face in the middle of a riot/demonstration . 
  especially if the people standing next to you do n't have their own piece of foam . 
  sun tea is normally served over ice . 
  i 'm not saying this to contend that italians * should * or * do * drink it ... just as an fyi . 
  oh man , that is my dad right there . 
  not to every single person ... but he is definitely not afraid to strike up a conversation with strangers on public transit . 
  in fairness though , my old mans antics are bizarre even by us standards . 
   what if someone replies with `` it 's shit , how about you ? '' . 
  `` damn , sorry to hear that . 
  i 'm alright/can ' t complain/amazing/shit too/etc '' then if they seem like they want to unburden themselves ... and you have the time , you can pursue the matter ... 
  otherwise you just move along or maybe say something like `` hope things turn around . '', 
  `` keep your chin up . '', 
  `` take care of yourself . '', 
  whatever . 
   or as they say in yiddish , `` mann lebt '' ( roughly translated : still alive ) . 
  if i 'm understanding the intended meaning of this there are a number of similar phrases in the us . 
  `` i 'm still here , are n't i ? 
  '' , `` surviving . 
  '' , `` same shit , different day . 
  '' , etc. 
  to that we would reply with something like `` i hear that . '', 
  nope , all good . 
  no bad mouthing perceived . 
  [ mrw when i thought i * was * recommending the less accentuated beers . 
  not a european ... but i believe i might be able to help , so if the locals will forgive me ... 
  i would recommend something straightforward like a [ pilsner ] ( http://www.firestonebeer.com/beers/products/pivo ) or [ pale ale ] ( http://www.sierranevada.com/beer/year-round/pale-ale ) , maybe a [ session ipa ] ( https://foundersbrewing.com/our-beer/all-day-ipa/ ) . 
  i have linked to fairly readily available versions of each style . 
  you are in indiana , right ? 
  maybe try and get your hands on some three floyds . 
  something like [ gumballhead ] ( https://www.3floyds.com/beer/gumballhead/ ) ( anecdotally , when i lived in chicago , i had a dutch friend that loved this beer ) , [ jinx proof ] ( https://www.3floyds.com/beer/jinx-proof/ ) , or [ alpha king ] ( https://www.3floyds.com/beer/alpha-king/ ) . 
  mikkel bjergso of the danish beer brand mikkeller opened a collaborative space with three floyds space in copenhagen called [ war pigs ] ( http://www.brewbound.com/news/3-floyds-mikkeller-open-warpigs-april ) ... so some europeans must at least tolerate their beers . 
  this is our fault ? 
  just curious . 
  is this limited to americans ... errr ... people that reside in the united states of america ? 
  i watch bbc world news most mornings , when they cover a story that involves the united states of america , they say `` the american official said '' , `` there was a mass shooting in the american city of ___ '' , etc. 
  similar experiences with films and television shows from countries other than the usa . 
  is this an anglosphere issue ? 
  do non native english speakers refer to us as something else ? 
  i know germans sometimes refer to us as amis , i assume that somehow derives from the word american . 
  for that matter the german word for someone from the us is amerikanisch , no ?
