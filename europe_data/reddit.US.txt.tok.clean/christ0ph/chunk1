`` rosetta '' as in stone ? 
  indeed . 
  free from the constraints of gravity , what we end up with is probably an amalgamation of very sharp , very small random particles . 
  it would not be good for the lungs if it got into a ship . 
  [ here are some other pics of the comet 's surface ] ( http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/10271850-a-feast-of-comet-features.html ), 
  it would be neat to have some images from some distance away of the probe 's meeting with the object . 
  but i guess that would require a sort of daughter ship . . 
  hard to say . . 
  the surface looks like it has powder on it but the general shape screams `` big rock '', 
  how cool . . 
  it will be really interesting - if its hard rock , and it looks like it is , is it a piece of a planet ? 
  there wont be much gravity so it will be very interesting what happens when those screws go out . 
  will they be able to bite into it ? 
  i do n't get your logic . . sorry . 
  of course , thats the way statistics always seem to work now . 
  a number of recent surveys indicate that [ ttip will be bad for jobs ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/ttip%20jobs.html ) . . 
  as i understand it , most of their money is spent on lobbying and advertising . . medical devices is the one bright spot in the us picture . . much worse is the [ drug situation ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1261198/# ) . . 
  you 're nuts . . obama is a neoliberal , which is a right wing thing . 
  he is just pretending to be a democrat . 
  actually , the unrestrained neoliberal extremist ideology represented by the hidden agenda in the ftas is headed down a path to a very dark place . . could it become just as destructive as the worst kinds of communism were in the 20th century ? 
  yes , it could . 
  he brings up a good point , [ tisa will quite possibly pit people ] ( http://www.world-psi.org/sites/default/files/documents/research/report_tisa_eng_lr2.pdf ) in the developed countries against people from the developed countries in competition for their jobs !, 
  divide and conquer ? 
  the problem is , the system is broken . 
  for example , [ look how many endocrine disrupting chemicals - edcs exist ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=endocrine+disruptors ) - most edcs are still unregulated . 
  the idea of ftas is to increase profits for multi-nationals . 
  they are laundry lists of bad ideas that could cost people huge amounts , for example , dangerous chemicals need to be regulated with an eye to preventing diseases like cancer , pro-actively . . `` better safe than sorry '' ( europe ) , makes more sense than `` innocent until * proven * guilty '' ( us ) when there are indications that a chemical is dangerous , it should be banned . 
  [ ttip is trying to freeze regulation of dangerous chemicals ] ( http://www.ciel.org/publications/toxicpartnership_mar2014.pdf ) . . 
  even though there is a 20 year backlog in the us [ which has left many chemicals like endocrine disruptors ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=endocrine+disruptors ) , unregulated . . edcs are dangerous chemicals which need to be regulated . 
  losing public healthcare alone can end up costing people half a million dollars or more over each person 's lifetime . . in today 's money . 
  [ example of us situation - interactions with gats ] ( http://www.maine.gov/legis/opla/ctpchlthcaresub.pdf ) - [ huge , unexpected costs used to prevent people from using healthcare ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/us/drive-by-doctoring-surprise-medical-bills.html ), 
  i think a great number of both europeans and americans will be hurt tremendously by the 3 ts ( tisa , ttip and tpp ) in a number of ways . . 
  the privatization of health care is being `` locked in '' in the us , by the ftas , tisa in particular , the existing and planned ftas are the core reason why our health care is so bad . 
  i think that similar dynamic will effect europeans . 
  also , studies have come our recently that indicate that [ ttip may lead to large job losses ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/ttip%20jobs.html ) . . 
  examples : one study [ indicates that up to 600,000 jobs will be lost in the eu as a direct result of ttip ] ( http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/policy_research/ttip_simulations.html ) a recent [ review of ttip studies ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/etudes/join/2014/528798/ipol-join_et ( 2014 ) 528798_en . pdf ) by the european parliamentary research service states :  * `` the regulatory core of ttip makes it extremely difficult for economists to come to grips with the expected economic meaning of the negotiation outcomes . 
  ntbs [ non-tariff barriers ] and mere regulatory heterogeneity create ` trade costs ' for market access , both ways , but it is exceedingly hard to assess authoritatively what the trade costs are , and what consequences they have , whether for goods or services . 
  yet , without good proxies of those costs and the scope for their reduction , an empirical economic analysis with proper modeling is basically impossible or mere sophisticated ` guess ' work . '' * john hilary of war on want - [ analyzing the cepr study ] ( http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/blogs/employment/ttip-don-t-mention-the-job-losses ) : . .  * `` at least 1.3 million european workers will lose their jobs as a direct result of the agreement . 
  in addition , over 715,000 us workers also stand to lose their jobs under this scenario , giving a total of over two million job losses in total . 
  ' '' * ----- `` a [ report by \u00d6fse , ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/ofse%20study.html ) the austrian foundation for development research , released in april this year , analysed four reports on ttip [ ecorys ( 2009 ) , cepr ( 2013 ) , cepii ( 2013 ) and bertelsmann/ifo ( 2013 ) ] in an attempt to answer some of these issues . 
  it found that : ''  * costs of unemployment , including long term unemployment , might be substantial , especially during the 10 year transition period of ttip . 
  based on projected job displacement in one of the studies of 0.4 -- 1.1 million , our rough ( and conservative ) calculation suggests implied costs of $ 5 -- $ 14 billion for unemployment benefits , excluding costs for re-training and skills-acquisition . 
  in addition , foregone public income from taxes and social contributions from unemployment might accrue to $ 4 -- $ 10 billion . 
  the tisa ( trade in services agreement ) being negotiated in secret contains provisions ( mode four ) that will let multinational corporations move their skilled employees around , something they can not do now , and mode four will as far as i know , not be subject to any kind of quota . 
  visas will have to be given . 
  countries probably will not be able to say no , [ as that would be a trade barrier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) . 
  as its a trade deal , its irreversible without paying compensation for potential future profits . 
  which could be very profitable for companies , basically , free money . 
  people have to understand the developed countries see themselves as needing leverage with the developing countries they do not have now . 
  so they aim to trade jobs for concessions like national treatment there . 
  the middle class in asia is growing very rapidly , and to sell to it they feel they need national treatment/most favored nation to apply . 
  they are the golden apple , the western countries dream of expanding into that growing market which will grow much faster than the mature western economies . 
  its entirely possible that that tisa mode four become much more popular than its counterpart in the gats is. , in any case , it represents a potential way for the developed countries to increase their trade leverage , trading other people 's jobs for market access in the developing countries . 
  multinational companies will have to pay minimum wages to their employees while they are in the host country . 
  but there really is no way to check . 
  it and automation is making people less important and with the loss of importance , the concessions which characterized the latter two thirds of the previous century are being rolled back . 
  none of them were formalized , and now they are vanishing . 
  its the so called `` race to the bottom '' . 
  ttip , tisa , etc. 
  have a built in ** ratchet ** , ** standstill ** , etc. 
  which ensures that the changes can only be one way , towards privatization , with the goal being complete privatization at the end . 
  so , endorsing ttip means endorsing a very radical stripping of the public interest into a tiered society where compassion is deliberately framed as bad . 
  a `` trade barrier '' or `` monopoly '' . 
  if you want more info , pm me . 
  did you know that ttip must be seen with tisa , the two go together ? 
  its economic suicide for jobs , but it will freeze a great many types of regulation for the big corporations . 
  it gives corporations entitlements to every change that happens in their favor and prevents any changes in the people 's favor by means of a `` ratchet effect '' . 
  its part of a global race to the bottom . 
  ( ratchet , standstill and rollback ) its important to remember that automation and it will save so much labor over the next two decades that huge job shifts everywhere will be completely unavoidable . 
  everybody is lying about this . 
  thats why i think tisa/ttip/tpp 's ( t3 's ) push to privatize public services and resources and freeze or roll back financial , labor and environmental regulation , globally is literally the worst possible thing right now . 
  http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/ttip%20jobs.html links to a bunch of article about jobs , some predict modest growth , but the most recent projections point out problems with the models used in those studies , and predict up to 2 million jobs lost . 
  which i actually think is too optimistic . 
  the growth will be in areas that wo n't create many jobs , compared to the numbers they will replace . 
  also , tisa will liberalise trans border trade in skilled labor , making it possible for companies to staff much more flexibly . 
  that will basically play the middle class in the developed world off against the skilled workers in the developing world in ways we have never seen before . 
  tisa mode four will really be a radical change . 
  who is the guy in the huge picture on the right side ? 
  yes , its true . 
  cold war era aircraft . 
  who could forget the b52 in the 1962 stanley kubrick masterpiece `` doctor strangelove '' ... 
  it 's not `` all about you '', 
  man , that plane is literally a piece of ancient history . 
  i did , see above . 
  the biggest threat to nuclear power plants and society is one which is quite substantial , which society seems to be largely ignoring . . 
  solar storms causing loss of the power grid , leading to loss of power for extended periods ( up to several years ! ), 
  and loss of ability to cool the spent fuel storage pools and eventual runaway thermal problem ( melt down ) that is partly what happened at fukushima . 
  loss of ability to cool the spent fuel technical term , `` loss of the ultimate heatsink '' . 
  two years ago in july 2012 we had a very close call , a huge cme occurred which barely missed earth . 
  which should have been our wake up call . . read this : https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf this is a global problem . 
  however , its being largely ignored . 
  simply losing power , without meltdowns , would lead to mass global chaos , mass starvation , and great loss of life , especially children and old people , but , like wwii it could be recovered from in 30 or 40 years . 
  however , if you add in twenty or thirty ( or likely more ) chernobyls or fukushimas ... due to thermal runaway at nuclear power plants melting down in the weeks and months following the loss of the grid , human society might not recover . . certainly any huge loss of arable land ( most of it is in the northern hemisphere which is also where most of the radiation would be ) would be a huge loss . . 
  so , we need to only build nuclear power plants that do not have this problem , from now on , and we need to figure out ways to address this problem with the ones we do . 
  we need a global power system that is less interconnected . 
  `` proof by strong gesticulation '' is no proof at all , my friend . 
   * `` the headline finding from the official assessment of ttip is that there will be a loss of at least one million jobs in the eu and us as a direct result of the agreement 's coming into force . 
  this is the conclusion of the report commissioned by the eu from the centre for economic policy research ( cepr ) in london at the outset of the negotiations ( [ pdf ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/september/tradoc_151787.pdf ) ) . 
  '' * source : http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/blogs/employment/ttip-don-t-mention-the-job-losses  * `` even under a less ambitious scenario , the cepr study predicts that ttip will lead to the direct loss of over 680,000 jobs in the eu and a further 325,000 in the us . 
  this means that ttip will lead to the loss of at least one million jobs between the eu and us , whatever the level of ambition achieved .
