  rate increases of 100 percent were the most common , while increases of 300 percent were reported . 
  the citizens rose in protest , forcing the cancellation of bechtel 's contract and replacing it with a community-controlled water system that is providing water more equitably and universally than before . 
  bechtel has responded with a $ 25 million lawsuit for lost pro\ufb01ts ( described below ) . 
  kwazulu-natal , south africa : after the world bank forced kwazulu-natal province in south africa to pri - vatize its water , those who were too poor to pay were simply cut off . 
  they were then forced to resort to using polluted river water , resulting in an outbreak of cholera that has claimed at least 32 lives . 
  in fact , due to privatization and other forces , cholera outbreaks affecting more than 140,000 people occurred in south africa between the years 2000 and 2002 . 
  this story is repeating itself all across africa today . 
  implications for the united states in the u.s. , water for drinking and sanitation is almost a completely government-run , non-pro\ufb01t and heavily subsidized service . 
  few americans , therefore , worry about access to water in the same way they worry about their medical bills , for example . 
  under gats rules , however , this would change . 
  ( it has changed - for example , european companies now own many formerly public water systems in the us . ), 
  loss of local government and rate payer control : if the u.s. commits water under the wto gats talks , munic - ipalities would loose the ability to decide how to provide water services . 
  the u.s. would be prohibited from maintaining public service `` monopolies '' or exclusive suppliers of the service . 
  this provision would require u.s. state , local , and federal governments to give private , for-pro\ufb01t water companies `` access '' to the `` market '' of our more than 60,000 u.s. municipal water service providers . 
  race to the bottom in water standards : if the u.s. commits water services under proposed gats rules any federal , state or local regulation governing water services , such as those designed to protect water quality , universal access , as well as public utility commission rulings , could be challenged as `` barriers to trade . '' a government would have to demonstrate that the policy was necessary and that no other less trade-restrictive measure could be taken to accomplish the same objective in order to maintain it . 
  privatization is a one-way street : under gats rules , if a municipality decides to experiment with privatizing water services by selling its operation to a foreign corporation , it is extremely dif\ufb01cult to bring the utility back under public control . 
  for instance , if a municipality is later unhappy with a private company 's performance , and wants to take back its water system , it not only must compensate the company under u.s. law , but the u.s. government must also compensate all potentially affected trading partners for their corporations ' lost business opportunities . 
  this double jeopardy is geared toward locking in privatization , and preventing the water take - backs which have occurred in many u.s. cities dissatis\ufb01ed with privatization experiments . 
  ** additional wto provisions that threaten water ** once water starts flowing it can not be stopped . 
  general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) article xi speci\ufb01cally prohibits the use of export controls for any purposes and eliminates quantitative restrictions on imports and exports . 
  this means that quotas or bans on the export of water imposed for environmental purposes could be challenged as a form of protection - ism . 
  thus , if the u.s. began to export water but then learned that it was harmful to the environment , it could not reduce the original amount of export without fear of a wto challenge . 
  trade can not be restricted to protect water . 
  under wto rules , nations can not differentiate between products based on how they are produced ( known as production processed methods ) . 
  if it were discovered that the commercial trade in water was destructive to watersheds , for example , the wto could prevent countries from restricting that trade based on environmental concerns . 
  ** furthermore , the wto requires that any law that a country writes to protect its water would also have to be the `` least trade restrictive '' law imaginable ( as interpreted by a panel of trade lawyers ) . 
  this vague language has already been the downfall of several environmental protection and public health laws . 
  nobody understands these ftas well . 
  even the so called experts always make mistakes ( and they often tell you that right at the beginning . ), 
  so , join the club . 
  none of us know what their plan is exactly , but its wise to assume that their goal is to do with these ftas what they wanted to do with mai and the most extreme directions that they could have taken gats . 
  the only prudent way to look at them is to see them as an attempt to make privatization the default , and everything for profit that possibly can be the default . 
  one would have to be blind not to see that this is the goal going into the 21st century . 
  people who are struggling for their very existence can not aspire to anything more than that . 
  they want to pull the ladders up . 
  i do n't think you are right on this one . 
  that would nullify one of the biggest reasons for these ftas . 
  also , water is a service . 
  so the one which will be the most applicable will probably be the most secretive one , tisa . 
  see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4, 
  gats ** is ** in there . 
  gats is included explicitly . 
  and your novel interpretation is a wide departure from current scholarship on ** gats ** . 
  clearly , ** audiovisual services ** are carved out . 
  ( by france ) ireland could do the same thing , insert a carve out for water . 
  just as the uk could have inserted a carve out for their nhs back in 1995 . 
  basically , * the fact that bottled water is already sold * ( or if anybody has been charged for water in any other way ) in ireland means that it could not be seen as exempted as the definition of services supplied ` in the exercise of governmental authority ' requires them to be supplied ( a ) not on a commercial basis , and ( b ) not in competition with any other service supplier . 
  now do you get it ? 
   * `` could you please link me to any source document ( one that comes from the us , or the eu ) that states that the ttip is to `` set up privatization as the goal for all public services '' ? 
  and not just the source document , but to also give me the page number and quote the relevant text yourself ? 
  '' * yes , gladly . 
  from ** `` directives for the negotiation on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership between the european union and the united states of america '' ** http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/st-11103-2013-dcl-1/en/pdf i 'm having a little bit of trouble getting the numbers to not `` renumber '' in my browser , so i need to attempt to get the correct formatting if it renumbers to anything else , this is sections 15-21 ** trade in services and establishment ** ( 15 . 
  ) the aim of negotiations on trade in services will be to *** bind the existing autonomous level of liberalisation of both parties at the highest level of liberalisation *** captured in existing ftas , in line with article v of gats , *** covering substantially all sectors and all modes of supply *** , while achieving new market access by tackling remaining long-standing market access barriers , recognising the sensitive nature of certain sectors . 
  furthermore , the us and the eu will include binding commitments to provide transparency , impartiality and due process * with regard to licensing and qualification requirements and procedures * , as well as to enhance the regulatory disciplines included in *** current us and eu ftas *** . 
  the parties should agree to grant treatment ** no less favourable ** for the establishment in their territory of companies , subsidiaries or branches of the other party than that accorded to their own companies , subsidiaries or branches , taking due account of the sensitive nature of certain specific sectors . 
  the agreement should develop a framework to facilitate mutual recognition of professional qualifications . 
  the agreement will not preclude the enforcement of exceptions on the supply of services ** justifiable under the relevant wto rules ** ( articles xiv and xivbis gats ) . 
  the commission should also ensure that nothing in the agreement prevents the parties from applying their national law , regulations and requirements regarding entry and stay , ** provided that , in doing so , they do not nullify or impair the benefits accruing from the agreement ** . 
  the eu and member states ' laws , regulations and requirements regarding work and labour ** conditions ** shall continue to apply . 
  the high quality of the eu 's public utilities should be preserved in accordance with the tfeu and in particular protocol no26 on services of general interest , and ** taking into account the eu 's commitment in this area , including gats ** . 
  ** services supplied [ in the exercise of governmental authority as defined by article i. 3 of gats ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) ** shall be excluded from these negotiations . 
  ** audiovisual ** services will not be covered by this chapter . 
  it 's a fact that the imminent tisa and ttip ftas * set up privatization as the goal for all public services * of member nations , ( by default , unless carved out , as for example , the french carved out their audiovisual services ) that do not fall into the extremely narrow gats exceptions . 
  which are interpreted as narrowly as could ever be imagined . 
  ( to verify , see the recently released '' [ directives for the negotiation on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership between the european union and the united states of america ] ( http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/st-11103-2013-dcl-1/en/pdf ) '' ) for discussions of gats interpretations and the historical and legal context used to construe them , see [ ` public services in bilateral free trade agreements of the eu ' by markus krajewski ] ( http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1964288 ) [ gats and public service systems ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) [ public services and the scope of the general agreement on trade in services ( center for international environmental law ciel.org ] ( http://www.ciel.org/publications/publicservicesscope.pdf ), 
  better to be honest about what 's wrong and what 's right , opinions are a sign of life . 
  here in the us , the community water systems have gradually been privatized in many areas and the effect has often been the opposite of what 's promised . 
  costs to communities often increase dramatically . 
  this document gives some case studies . . [ waves of regret : what some cities have learned and other cities should know about water privatization fiascos in the united states ] ( http://www.citizen.org/documents/waves.pdf ) all around the world , there has been pressure from organizations like the wto , the world bank and the imf for countries to privatize natural resources like water . 
  this is often a mistake because free trade agreements contain so called `` ratchet '' clauses which can make the decisions irreversible no matter how bad a decision it proves to be . 
  [ water privatization fiascos : broken promises and social turmoil - a special report by public citizen 's water for all program . 
  ] ( http://www.citizen.org/documents/privatizationfiascos.pdf ) [ ten reasons to oppose water privatization ] ( http://www.citizen.org/documents/top10-reasonstoopposewaterprivatization.pdf ), 
  how the hell could they become so out of sync with society in the first place ? 
  how many people are `` not at home '' ? 
  its probably because they both are complicit in it . 
  from what i know , i suspect a major cause of the problems in the uk is also something that has caused a lot of problems in the us , which almost nobody knows about there , either . 
  gats , the wto services agreement which was signed in the 1990s . . a lot of the issues - risks , which people are attributing to being a threat if ttip/tisa are passed , are actually already risks which were caused by gats and have been completely covered up/hidden . 
  like gats was/is the cause of the one way ratchet behind the scenes forcing incremental nhs privatization . 
  in the uk , allyson pollock has written extensively on the issues . 
  the same issues apply in the us to health care but here its even worse , and the fta causes behind the scenes are covered up even more aggressively . 
  `` never mind the small print - trust us '' eh ? 
  you 're nuts if you do n't see the [ global water grab ] ( http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/water/private-vs-public/ ) and local land grab for what it is . 
  ireland is basically almost the saudi arabia of fresh water . 
  ** if any country should recognize the danger of privatizing the * water commons * , its ireland . 
  ** evidently irish law prohibits water privatization . 
  ( water services act of 2013 , part 1 section 5 ( 6 ) * `` without the consent of the minister and the minister for finance '' * [ source ] ( http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/gene-kerrigan/never-mind-the-small-print-trust-us-30620675.html ) excerpt below ...  * `` and i believe that there 's a long term privatisation strategy under way . 
  '' *  now , on the face of it , privatisation is impossible . 
  last week , we showed that the small print on the irish water website referred to a procedure for selling the company , and how irish water `` may disclose customer data to the prospective seller or buyer '' ; and that customers ' personal data `` will be one of the transferred assets '' . 
   irish water said that the website should n't have said that . 
  the references have been removed . 
   irish water 's head of communications , elizabeth arnett , has made various media appearances to assure us that our personal data is safe with them , and that there will be no privatisation . 
   the legislation , she said , prohibits privatisation . 
  on prime time she said : `` irish water can not be sold , it 's against the law '' . 
  so , that sounds solid . 
  no privatisation , it would be illegal . 
   but , would it ? 
  no doubt ms arnett believes so . 
  she would have received a thorough briefing on what irish water wishes to tell us ; the legal prohibition on privatisation would no doubt have been drawn to her attention . 
  she would not , we can be confident , have been made privy to privatisation plans , as she would not then be able to stand over the company 's claim that it can not be sold - and there 's no doubt that her statement was made in good faith . 
   what is the legislation that prohibits privatisation ?
