  it 's the water services act of 2013 , part 1 , which deals with company formation . 
   section 5 ( 4 ) of the act says that the board will have one share in the company , and all remaining shares will be halved between the minister for the environment and the minister for finance . 
   section 5 ( 6 ) says : `` the board shall not . 
  alienate the share issued to it in accordance with subsection ( 4 ) '' . 
   archaic language , but clear enough . 
  under this legislation , the board is indeed prohibited from selling its one share . 
  but , see those three dots ? 
   where those three dots are , the legislation says : `` without the consent of the minister and the minister for finance '' . 
   so , the legislation prohibits the board from selling the company - unless the government wants it sold . 
  the law , therefore , specifically allows for privatisation .

  its a controversy with uanswered questions , what do we do if this is not an isolated incident in the future . 
  will the entire facility end up contaminated due to these wrong assumptions as to the integrity of the container technology used - what if over time ( donnt forget they are supposed to stay there for a very long time ) failing repeatedly ? 
   * `` you mean , it exploded and the filtering system preventing any significant contamination outside the facility . 
  '' * its a huge facility , and the contamination inside of a single room in a large cave where a large number of waste containers are stored is still quite significant when we realize that there is no way of knowing if the same set of circumstances will in the future lead to more failures of more containers in more rooms . 
  was the air ventilation system even designed to allow isolation of contaimation in a single room ? 
  what do they use - whatever means do they use to monitor radiation and isolate individual parts of the mine/cave ? 
  is that being done ? 
   * `` 1 ) decentralized renewables will not aid in surviving a solar flare . 
  after all , long range connections are essential to have a semblance of a functional grid with renewables , and it 's those connections that will fail . 
  '' * localized low voltage dc power systems , as are used in off the grid homes , has a different set of tradeoffs . 
  what if we reexamined the iterfaces bwtween the long lines and the local systems ? 
  as `` buck/boost '' converters become more and more efficient , ( some are far more efficient than the traditional hv transformers ) some localized disadvantages of dc systems in the past seem to be vanishing . 
  additionally , the widespread availability of gps for timing makes the time regulating function of the pwer grid less and less significant . 
  it seems to me that the need of `` the grid '' to maintain 50 hz ( or 60 hz ) must be intimately involves with the ability of that grid to recover from localized transformer failures . 
  the grid might be fairly easy to transition to store and forward of power function . 
  then it would integrate far better with decentralized and heterogeneous power sources of all kinds . 
  at least that 's what this solar storm issue has me increasingly thinking . 
  when the previously public owned water resource , is privatized , the resource grab is almost always made irreversible . 
  if a foreign investor is involved , the free trade agreements give them an entitlement to remain , and not be regulated in any way that causes adverse effects on their profits . 
  that 's called `` indirect expropriation '' and its barred by isds . 
  the `` ratchet '' in ftas like ttip makes `` liberalization '' ( privatization ) one way . . 
  even though a lot of [ water privatizations are literally fiascos ] ( http://www.citizen.org/documents/privatizationfiascos.pdf ) , they still can not be reversed . 
  [ food and water watch : water privatization ] ( http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/water/private-vs-public/ ) . 
  there are cushy jobs waiting for them in the lobbying industry , so i doubt if they are worried . 
  actually , since ( the existing 1990s wto services agreement ) ** gats is included by reference ** in ttip and tisa - and since water is concerned , * since its both a service , and a commodity * , tisa must be considered too . . * they all should be understood together as a package of interlocking secret agreements which are being broken up as they are being to conceal their intents and effects until long after they have been successfully enacted . 
  * we 're dealing with the same people who tried to enact ** mai ** in the 1990s - and failed , due to its isds and similar intolerable content becoming widely known . 
  then they enacted the wto and wto *** gats *** , and tried to get more radical `` us style '' defaults , * which forced the privatizations unless they were carved out at the beginning * , approved as `` the '' defaults by more countries , but failed , leaving gats less radical than they wanted . 
  * it appears that almost nobody who is involved in this has ever dealt with the kinds of people that do these kinds of things , because they are making all sorts of unfortunately far too trusting assumptions and not watching out for these kinds of deceptions . 
  * do n't make the assumption they are like the kinds of politicians you used to have a long time ago ( or perhaps still have if you are lucky ), 
  if they [ privatize the system ] ( http://canadians.org/blog/tisa-threatens-lock-water-privatization ) because of tisa/ttip they basically are creating an irreversible private ownership situation . 
  water is potentially very , very valuable , so its being privatized . 
  tisa is the trade in services agreement - [ note the endorsement of `` standstill '' and `` ratchet '' as well as gats here ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-%2f%2fep%2f%2ftext%2bta%2bp7-ta-2013-0325%2b0%2bdoc%2bxml%2bv0%2f%2fen&amp;language=en ) there are short descriptions of `` standstill '' and `` ratchet '' here . . ----- http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/445656.html clauses prevent s.korea from lowering its level of openness by jung eun-joo  * the provisions of the south korea-european union fta ( koreu fta ) contain `` poison pills '' hidden in some clauses . 
  one source of controversy is the presence of `` ratchet '' clauses . 
  although the government says this agreement includes none , the text contains phrases just like the ratchet clauses in that of the korus fta ( south korea-u.s. fta ) . 
  a ratchet is a device that stops a cog wheel revolving in one direction from turning back the other way . 
  in a fair trade agreement , a ratchet clause is one that stops one state from taking measures to lower its level of openness vis-a-vis the other state . 
  *  * regarding services and investment , chapter 7 of the koreu fta states that all clauses of the agreement can be amended as long as they do not reduce the duties and agreements regarding market access , treatment of nationals and treatment of the most-favored nation . 
  this phrase is exactly the same as that of the ratchet clause in article 12 of the korus fta . 
  *  * however , trade minister and chief negotiator kim jong-hoon asserted on oct. 22 at a parliamentary inspection of the ministry of foreign affairs and trade ( mofat ) that the former was a `` standstill clause , '' different to that of the ratchet clause in the korus fta . 
  a standstill is a principal of trade that prevents the adoption of extra protectionist measures . 
  lee hae-yeong , professor of international relations at hanshin university , refuted this , saying , `` a clause that prevents the adoption of new regulations and ensures that any amendments go only in the direction of further openness is one that prevents retrogression regardless of what it is called . '' lee went on to say , `` it is clear that the inclusion of such a clause would place limitations on south korea 's policy choices .

  they would probably wait until they are satisfied their system is working . 
  these days they are technically fairly complex , because they have all sorts of internetworking going on . 
  no meter readers , they basically read themselves . 
  they are i am sure being required to charge by the trade agreements . 
  which explicitly include gats ( the wto services agreement ) by reference . 
  it 's a matter of principle for them . 
  same thing with detroit . 
   * `` how the irish are protesting water charges '' * it 's probably water privatization , eventually . 
  wto services agreement ( gats ) which is embedded by reference in ttip/tisa may require water privatization as they do with so many other services .

  [ water privatization coming to your town , thanks to the wto ? 
  ] ( http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/blogs/water-privatization-coming-to-your-town-thanks-to-the-wto/ ), 
  you all should read the following : [ tisa threatens to lock in water privatization ] ( http://canadians.org/blog/tisa-threatens-lock-water-privatization ) also , to understand why the fta rules require privatization of water and its being sold for a profit , people should understand that ttip explicitly embeds ( includes by reference ) in its core document the gats ( wto services agreement ) which makes privatization of a great many public services mandatory ( although it may take decades for events to happen which complete the transition ) see [ gats and public service systems ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ), 
  i think the designs are quite well done . 
  western european and american oligarchs want to cash in as eastern european oligarchs did . 
  i 'm sure you , being romanian , know how , at the instant communism fell , in various countries in your area , the largest criminals , the people who soon were to become oligarchs - ( in russia they were called `` new russians '' were there with cash . 
  many of the deals they got turned out to be the products of extreme levels of corruption and should have been reversed . 
  as they were not in the public interest at all . 
  what the quite inappropriately framed treaties do is * irreversibly , incrementally and surreptitiously * hand over a right to ultimate ownership of the right to control almost every aspect of public services and market conditions ( blocking any new laws which change anything concerning them ) - abdicating government ability and responsibility ( and ability ) to regulate entire market segments ( like health care - they are unable to do anything that adversely effects profits , which leaves very little they can do ) to the corporate new oligarchs . 
  - ** irreversibly ** - this * eliminates the accountability * and can serve as the beginnings of a complete end to government protection of citizens from excesses of corporate greed . 
  the meaning of the references to gats in the `` mandate '' ( which is anything but - a `` mandate '' , because nobody realizes this ) is to convey the intent of these ftas to judges is that they are an irreversible * one way street * with no exits , to privatization . 
  if that is not what people want , the gats references ( the `` mandate '' ) must be replaced . 
  left unaltered , it covertly implement a `` ratchet '' which makes privatization of public resources and services one way and irreversible . 
  they are creating a new oligarchy which is immune from any kind of human accountability . 
  just as the waves of privatization which swept eastern europe after the fall of communism served to vastly enrich oligarchs in many countries who were closely associated with organized crime , so the oligarchy in the western nations hopes to be enriched by this new wave of irreversible privatization based on the [ most extreme parts ] ( http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/gats_03_e.htm#comm ) of wto-gats . 
  nuclear waste container failure is a major issue right now , due to the failure of at least one of the very high tech containers inside of an underground storage facility ( a salt cavern ) here in the us , that was supposed to last for thousands of years . 
  it exploded and caused major contamination . 
  i do n't think they have figured out what caused it yet . 
  that incident should be seen as a reminder that there is a lot that we still do n't know that we need to know about issues related to nuclear energy . 
  particularly storage of waste from nuclear fission . 
  an even bigger and more pressing issue is the potential risk of ( multiple ? ), 
  meltdown ( s ) from a future large solar storm ( technically - a `` coronal mass ejection '' or cme ) causing massive multiple simultaneous failures of global energy grids , ( itself a huge and little-appreciated problem ) the worst-case scenario is one which has been proposed in a number of petitions by a new hampshire ( us ) ngo , `` resilient societies '' to the us nrc . 
  they hypothesize that a large solar storm ( as large as the `` carrington event '' solar storm in 1859 , which was before global energy grid existed ) would ( as they have in the past , but much more extensively ) cause failure of a great many high voltage transformers , huge and very expensive power transformers which take years to replace - ( the global manufacturing capacity is fairly limited . ), 
  that could lead to massive losses of power which in some areas would probably persist for extended periods of time ( years ) . 
  this failure of transformers , could in some cases , potentially lead to failure of the cooling systems which are used at nuclear reactor sites to contain spent fuel , which still generates huge amounts of heat . 
  if those pools of spent fuel are not supplied with water they could eventually enter a condition called `` loss of the ultimate heat sink '' and melt down . 
  so , what is called for is additional redundant cooling systems for spent fuel pools which are completely independent of global grids . . we need to prioritize the building and maintenance of cooling systems which could maintain cooling of the spent fuel pools for an extended period ( years ) the risk that some nuclear power plants might go into melt down if the grid disruption leads to any inability to cool the spent fuel sounds quite terrifying but the fact is , its an engineering problem that can be addressed far better than many others and what is called for is a global effort to address all of the issues surrounding that issue adequately now . 
  all of these problems highlight the need to transition to cleaner more decentralized ( and renewable ) energy . 
  with its waste issues , fission is not the best approach to nuclear energy , fusion probably is . 
  i think we will end up discovering a way to perform controllable nuclear ** fusion ** soon , and then hopefully we will be able to ** abandon fission ** and its tendency to produce all this very dangerous waste , in the near future . 
  there is nothing more stupid . 
  those tactical nukes should never have been made . 
  i should make the link to the study ( which was sponsored in part by cio magazine , of all people ) more obvious . 
  http://www.inthepublicinterest.org/article/out-control-coast-coast-failures-outsourcing-public-services-profit-corporations ttip 's `` mandate '' is to privatize irreversibly - which should never be done the ttip/tisa as it is now , makes privatization irreversible which must be stopped . 
  one reason it turns out , that politicians often want to privatize turns out to be looting . 
  they often turn out to have a financial stake in some outcome . 
  thats what we do . . 
  i know , i do it too .
