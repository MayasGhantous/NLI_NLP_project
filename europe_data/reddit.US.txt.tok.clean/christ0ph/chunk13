  due to an inability to cool the spent fuel which continues to generate heat for a very long time . 
  they will get a big payoff if the uk decides to go non nuclear , because of isds . 
  however it would only take one solar storm to cause dozens of solar meltdowns in its aftermath , look at the refs i just posted which have been downvoted to hide them . 
  that should tell you something . 
  its a crucial issue , because these cme events happen fairly frequently . 
  there was one in july 2012 which caused a massive solar flare , ( recorded by one of the two satellites we have - one at each lagrange point - to observe the sun ) had it hit earth it likely would have destroyed large parts of the global power grid - quite possibly leading to `` many fukushimas '' all at the same time . 
  this ngo has been petitioning the us nrc successfully to examine the issue but their response so far has been inadequate - http://www.resilientsocieties.org/inthenews.html, 
  there are urgent , but quite little-known risk of a ** solar storm ** ( like one which occurred in 1859 , the `` carrington event '' ) causing massive destruction of the global power grid and a loss of the ability to cool the spent fuel pools . . https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf that lack of cooling ability , ** `` loss of the ultimate heat sink '' ** it is called , * could lead to multiple nuclear melt-downs all around the world at the same time * . . we just missed one of these massive solar storms in july 2012 . 
  here is resilient societies may 4 , 2012 response on the diesel fuel issue . . 
  the resupply and useability of diesel fuel remains of concern for prolonged loop conditions . 
  in our earlier petition ( prm-50-96 ) , we indicated that the commission staff should consider on - site ** solar powered ** systems as a complement to emergency diesel generators . 
  these emergency solar generators ( esgs ) would purposely not be connected to the long lines of the bulk electric system , to protect against both geomagnetic storm impacts and high altitude emp risks . 
  our concerns about the availability and reliability of workable diesel fuel remain undiminished . 
  low sulfur diesel fuels , unlike their predecessor formulations , have diminished shelf-life . 
  depending upon conditions of storage and filtering , these fuels require turnover , so edgs will operate reliably when needed . 
  moreover , in a prolonged regional or national station blackout condition -- which could result from a severe solar storm -- the shutdown of diesel fuel production facilities could result in unexpected looting , or black market sales , or other unplanned risks to receipt of diesel fuel that is under firm contract for delivery to nuclear power plants . 
  so diesel fuel deliveries may become uncertain , and previously refined diesel fuels may become stale . 
  under the ( us ) defense production act of 1950 , as amended , the secretary of defense and the president have emergency planning authority to requisition essential supplies . 
  but it is more prudent to design robust on-station backup power capabilities that can operate through a prolonged loop event that could affect an entire region and not just a single commission-licensed power plant . 
  ------  * `` any incident that could come close to overcoming the safety barriers in place is going to destroy a huge amount of infrastructure and kill a large part of the population first , which is precisely what happened in japan . 
  britain being without power for a year or two would likely be apocalyptic , but honestly i think the safest place to ride it out would be a nuclear control room . 
  '' * actually , a solar storm would not be visible to the naked eye except perhaps as a dimming of the sun . 
  ( large sunspots ) however , a day or so after the light reached us the charged particles would reach us and major havok would ensue around the globe as all long wires became energized by extremely powerful emf . 
  i have a home electronics workshop and i am very familiar with esd . 
  esd can destroy electronic components very easily - a single spark of static electricity will destroy many chips . 
  what this means is that a great many computer containing devices will be rendered useless . 
  the huge transformers that cuple different legs of the power grid will fail due to arcing . 
  this will cause melting of their internal elements . 
  making them useless multi ton lumps of metal . 
  it could easily take years to get the power grid back up . . 
  i live in the us and i assure you , obama most decidedly was `` sold '' as a `` stepping stone to single payer '' . 
  people were told we have to `` pass the bill to see what 's in it '' everybody was promised affordable care - but of course , the `` stakeholder '' industries are addicted to easy money , since they own washington , why not ? 
  so its not affordable , and will never be affordable , and people are dying because they can not afford to go to the doctor and pay rent too . 
  its a real example of regulatory capture . 
  the influence of money on politics spinning out of control . 
  its an ideological disaster . 
  all the worst disasters in human history are caused by extremist ideologies . 
  - probably the industries that are cashing in , are covering it up with - sock puppets , lots and lots of sock puppets . 
  obvious sock puppets . 
  tisa , actually , i think the services stuff is in tisa and europeans have been intentionally convinced its in ttip to get them to waste a year barking up the wrong tree . 
  nope . . it does n't get more real than this . 
  / u/savannajeff - they appear to be `` the '' ngo that is focusing the most on this very scary issue . 
  you know , we dont all have to be adversarial on this . . thats not a good way to approach issues like this , either . 
  i 'm gradually working my way through their docketed submissiins and trying to get a feel for how far the interchange has gotten on it . 
  the bottom line is that all of our nations are fairly dysfunctional and irresponsible when it comes to some real world issues like this . 
  but we have to keep pushing them . 
  the [ cost of failure ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/kiev-ukrainiannationalchernobylmuseum_15.jpg ) is too great . 
  how they respond to this kind of issue tells us a lot about their fitness to govern . 
  btw , the [ controversial isds ] ( http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1264&amp;context=matthew_rimmer ) clearly does make it extremely difficult for governments to adjust to new information like this . 
  perhaps that is why they are stonewalling . 
  * `` any reactor in britain is able to shut down and provide adequate cooling without external power '' * how ? 
  you know that the grid could be put out of commission for months or years , do n't you ? 
  read this ebook - if you want a lot of detail about how long the grid could be out . 
  severe space weather events -- understanding societal and economic impacts : a workshop report ( 2008 ) http://www.nap.edu/download.php?record_id=12507# also why fukushima was preventable james m. acton and mark hibbs - its a carnegie report - it goes into a lot of detail about the `` loss of the ultimate heatsink '' problem . 
  even with no emergency there is a long wait for these transformers , evidently . 
  read the ttip `` neotiating mandate '' - it [ bars any new public services in its 38 signatory nations ] ( http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/st-11103-2013-dcl-1/en/pdf ) , and mandates the gradual dissolution of existing ones . 
  he may not be american . 
  he and perhaps some sock puppets he manages , clearly do try to drown out opposing voices that do n't want to endorse his radical neoliberal agenda . 
  i am american and i dont endorse his politics . 
  the fact is , most americans have literally never heard of the 3 ftas which are pending . 
  they sold us a bill of goods with obama that represented him as a leftist . 
  and guess what - they `` sold '' obamacare by representing it as a `` stepping stone to single payer '' ( public health care ) like you have in europe !, 
  really . . here is proof . 
  http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ or simply google the above phrase , `` stepping stone to single payer '', 
  there is also a pesky issue with solar storms which may cause multiple nuclear meltdowns https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf basically , transformers used to connect parts of the grid would blow up and it takes years to rebuild them . . 
  millions would starve or die of lack of water because electricity is used to pump water and transport food . 
  must read petition to the nrc about an important issue . . boiling water reactors have an issue related to loss of the ultimate heatsink which could bite us if a strong solar storm disrupted the global power grid . 
  not as unlikely scenario as we would hope . 
  we just missed one two years ago .

  i have serious problems with these clauses . 
  ** this is the infamous `` standstill '' . 
  which makes committments of the gats kind to be irreversible - and perhaps even using the gats signing dates . . in the 1990s !!,

  no , i 'm also talking about out of pocket charges . . and i suspect you are out of the us , maybe have not been here in a few years . . or you have employer coverage , which have low co pays . . obamacare is a completely different animal . 
  under aca plans , premiums are low , but covered , in network oop costs can be huge . . 
  right away , understand that anything which involves a hospital becomes wildly expensive . 
  people now do n't get in and out of a hospital for any reason for less than $ 750 . 
  that is what a fifteen minute two or three stitch injury might cost . 
  with aca insurance . 
  they often want people to pay the oop part on the spot with a credit card .

  ask any american who does n't work for the astroturf companies . 
  lots of people posting on blogs are paid to obscure this issue . 
  ( according to a friend in the ad industry ) here is what obamacare 's mission was stopping : http://www.pnhp.org/resources/pnhp-research-the-case-for-a-national-health-program, 
  actually , in 2014 the limit on additional ( in addition to premiums ) out of pocket ( oop ) costs for some people in aca plans - usually limited to $ 6200 for individuals and $ 12600 for families ) can instead be twice that - be $ 12000 and for some families $ 24000 if certain circumstances apply . . ( oop charges are mostly doctor co pays , drug costs . . and allowed charges for any procedures in hospitals and other providers - out of network charges are different and there is no limit on them ) see http://www.nationalhealthcouncil.org/nhc_files/pdf_files/nhc_moop_letter.pdf also now some allowed plans from large employers are exempted and *** do n't cover any hospital care at all .
