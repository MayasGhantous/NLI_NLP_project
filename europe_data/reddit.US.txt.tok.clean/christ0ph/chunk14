  whoa - you left out important facts there . . 1 . 
  *** ebola would clearly not be considered preventative care !, 
  *** 2 . many people can not afford the silver plans which i suspect you are describing . 
  only relatively wealthy americans can afford to buy the low risk plans which dont have the aca plans narrow networks . . they can cost thousands of dollars a month . 
  aca silver plans are not what the silver would indicate , they still have the very narrow networks , and only doctors who have agreed to very sensitive secret contracts are in these networks . 
  people who sign up for obamacare plans end up underinsured even if they follow all the recommendations they still are exposed to a lot of risk . 
  http://avalere.com/expertise/managed-care/insights/analysis-despite-subsidies-chronically-ill-individuals-will-be-underinsured many americans can not even afford monthly premiums ( note the main costs are not in the premiums for anybody who gets ill - the additional charges for in network covered costs - see below , are in theory limited to $ 6000 or $ 12000 for a family of two or more - but that limit [ only applies to in network covered charges ( and there [ are exemptions allowing twice that in 2014 ] ( http://www.nationalhealthcouncil.org/nhc_files/pdf_files/nhc_moop_letter.pdf ) for many who have two network managers ) see the following articles for examples of what i mean . 
  [ after surgery , surprise $ 117,000 medical bill from doctor he did n't know - nytimes.com ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/us/drive-by-doctoring-surprise-medical-bills.html ) . . and [ out of network , not by choice , and facing huge health bills - nytimes.com ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/your-money/out-of-network-not-by-choice-and-facing-huge-health-bills.html?_r=1&amp; ) http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2014/september/26/employee-insurance-hospitalization-coverage.aspx http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/business/increasingly-high-deductible-health-plans-weigh-down-employees.html many can not afford silver plans , even though they are the only ones which offer tax rebates ( although the tax rebates which were used to sell the aca in 34 states [ are now threatened by several lawsuits ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/us/us-cannot-subsidize-health-plans-in-states-with-no-marketplace-a-judge-rules.html ) ) , even the currently cheapest bronze plans are not being bought by many people because they are too expensive ( even the premiums are too expensive , a lot of americans do n't realize that there are these other costs ! ), 
  so they are now promoting the idea of copper plans . 
  ** the idea is encouraging poor people to buy insurance so that at least half of the * in network * bills will be paid - so that poor people can afford to get into at least one hospital door in each geographic area if somebody gets sick ** . 
  the bills will come later .

  * ------------ stay in the network !, 
  the health law says that , once you join a qualified plan , you wo n't pay more out of pocket per year than $ 6,350 for an individual and $ 12,700 for a family . 
  but this applies only to in-network care . 
  whether you 're in an hmo that pays almost no out-of-network benefits or a ppo that covers some , the pocketbook protections do n't apply if you use a non-network doc or hospital . 
  non-network providers also frequently bill you far more than what they charge patients in their networks for the same procedure . 
  try to stay in-network even if it 's for emergency care . 
  insurance plans do have to pay for non-network emergency visits under the health law . 
  if you 're in a car crash far from home you ca n't be picky about which hospital saves your life . 
  but non-network hospitals often `` balance-bill '' the difference between what your plan pays and what they charge , which is often much more . 
  avoid all emergency rooms unless it 's really an emergency . 
  traditionally , health plans came with a modest copayment for an emergency visit -- maybe $ 150 . 
  but many policies sold under the health law , even those in the more expensive `` gold '' category , not only have er copays of several hundred dollars but also subject er charges to the overall deductible . 
  ( copays are flat fees for specific services . 
  deductibles are what you pay out of pocket before the insurance kicks in . ), 
  that means you could be billed for the full cost of an emergency visit -- up to the out-of-pocket limit . 
  `` this is a huge difference and will really hurt the unsuspecting person , '' says john jaggi , an illinois insurance broker . 
  `` we 're putting a lot more people into that exposure here . '', 
  broken leg ? 
  head to the hospital . 
  sprained ankle ? 
  maybe wait until the urgent care center or doctor 's office opens . 
  pay monthly premiums on time and accurately . 
  `` do not mess around . 
  pay your premium , '' admonishes karen pollitz , a consumer specialist at the kaiser family foundation . 
  ( khn is an editorially independent project of the foundation . ), 
  `` otherwise that will be the end of you and you wo n't get to sign up again until the next open season . '', 
  ( open enrollment for 2014 coverage ends march 31 . 
  open enrollment for 2015 begins nov. 
  even underpaying the premium by a few cents could give the insurance company grounds to kick you off , she said . 
  insurers allow a brief grace period if you get behind -- somewhat longer if you 're receiving premium subsidies -- but they will terminate coverage for nonpayment . 
  register online with your new insurance company . 
  insurance sites are good for tracking claims . 
  increasingly they also let you shop around for the best deals on non-emergency treatment . 
  `` your health plan might pay one imaging center half what it pays another imaging center , '' metcalf said . 
  `` that 's really important if you 've got a big deductible . '', 
  save paperwork . 
  make sure you really owe what doctors and hospitals bill you for . 
  `` now is a good time to become a pack rat , '' says pollitz . 
  `` if you 've got any concern , it really is worth it to make a call and get them to explain what they did . '', 
  if you do n't get satisfaction from providers or insurers , try regulators . 
  check the insurer 's explanation of benefits detailing your claims . 
  it may show a phone number for a consumer assistance program in your state to help deal with medical coverage . 
  here is a list of consumer assistance programs . 
  this list has contact information for state insurance departments and other regulators . 
  do read the plan 's summary of benefits and coverage . 
  `` get it and print it out , because that has the details of your plan , '' says metcalf . 
  `` how it works . 
  what do you have to pay in order to go to a primary care doctor ? 
  is it before or after the deductible ? 
  `` how big is your deductible ? 
  how much does it cost to go to the emergency room ? '', 
  it 's not like reading john grisham . 
  but the subjects -- your health and your money -- are really important . 
  we want to hear from you : contact kaiser health news, 
  here in the us even insured people may often have to pay hundreds of dollars ( which counts against their deductible which can be as high as $ 6000 ) to see a doctor !, 
  people who get sent to hospitals have been known to try to get out of moving ambulances . 
  around two years ago a guy in new york state went into a store , and stole a teddy bear , then went into the parking lot , sat down and waited to be arrested . 
  he wanted to go to jail [ so he could get medical treatment for his leukemia ] ( http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20121208/cityandregion/121209222/1002 ) . 
  to print something on top of using some kind of holographic ink process . . iridescent ... 
  thank god that the magical event that brought down the berlin wall in one day , happened . 
  people made it vanish , not politicians . 
  the issue of people not being able to see a doctor without fear of bankruptcy , anywhere , is important globally , for public health . 
  posts on the ttip , tisa , or any trade treaty - one way or another , are not getting seen . 
  i dont have the time to try to analyze why . 
  maybe 75 % of my posts on ttip etc. 
  just get rejected on dozens of grounds , or they sit at one or two points and appear to not be seen . 
  but , that should tell us something . 
  do you see why understanding the bizarre disconnect between things [ like this ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) and [ this , which is the real picture ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) , are also - or should be , very important to europeans ? 
  so they can understand and avoid a great injustice . 
  very nice . . my guess is they will engrave something over the abstract on the back in holographic ink . 
  they should help stop the killing . 
  if they are willing to do that , then they should get a second chance , but only then . 
  i would n't let them back in until after they had made a significant contribution to defeating them . . 
  so , lets pretend that obama is n't pushing the three anti-democracy ftas that make single payer illegal/impossible forever ? 
  i hear lots of democrats plan to join the entire gop in voting for them in the lame duck session , maybe at 1:00 in the morning , like cafta . 
  right before they leave * through the revolving door * . 
   * `` the only fucking way we were getting a single-payer system was if the president was replaced by a dictator who * *** undermined democracy *** * for the greater good , '' * hold on for a second , you as i 'm sure you know , have it ** bass ackwards ** . . *** what would be the whole point of isds if decisions could be reversed ? 
  the whole crooked system would be destroyed if that could happen ? 
  *** no , its the us 's position that ftas are forever , so no changing the national minds , ever !, 
  ** no future senate or congress - no future president could be allowed to change the decision ** which the free trade agreement had carved in stone . 
  after all , as we know , ** investors need stability ** , right ? 
   * `` so you 're telling me if you get shot or come down with ebola you 're going to not be able to get care in the united states ? 
  '' * if you get shot , obviously , you 're in no position to refuse care , just so you wont lose your home , in fact , you may not even be conscious . 
  if somebody comes down with ebola , i think thats something that most people rightfully would realize is statistically very unlikely . 
  so , if somebody comes down with a fever of unknown origin , they are very likely to try to tough it out . 
   * `` you 're telling me that the united states does n't offer a comparable level of emergency healthcare as europe ? 
  '' * no , it may even be better in some ways . 
  thats not what we 're talking about here .
