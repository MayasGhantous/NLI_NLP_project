   * `` you 're telling me that the european union is leagues ahead in capability when it comes to quarantining a ebola epidemic in comparison to the united states ? 
  '' * no , i did n't say that either . 
  i 'm just trying to say that a growing number of american people ca n't go to the doctor - and obamacare did n't help . 
  in fact , for the millions of people who had group coverage before - who now have obamacare , its worse . 
  millions ca n't go , they do n't go - because they are living paycheck to paycheck . 
  they dont buy nice things , they just get by . 
  so , unless its literally a matter of life and death , they cant , and even then , they may not . 
  * because they do not want to get a new bill every month that they often can not afford . 
  if they `` seek care '' . 
  * they may even see obamacare as a trap . 
  which is a justified belief because in the 2009 senate finance committee hearings , on cspan it was portrayed again and again as ending `` free riders '' . 
  people here in the us often try to get out of moving ambulances . 
  and most of us understand why . 
  ( i 'm sure you do too , so what 's with the phony indignation ? ), 
  they have to pay rent . 
  it does n't get more real than that . 
  the rest of your comment is just more of the same - phony indignation . 
  is this statement true ? 
   * access to emergency healthcare is just as wide-spread & available as it is in europe . 
  * answer : false [ nothing could be further ] ( http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/in-the-literature/2013/nov/access-affordability-and-insurance.aspx ) from the truth . 
  note : in the us the word `` access '' is a code word for `` being offered '' as in you can buy this if you can afford it . 
  but you probably ca n't . 
  for example , they made a big stink about obamacare being available because previously , millions of self-employed americans could not even buy insurance at any price . 
  for millions of others it costs ( and still does cost ) several thousand dollars a month ( thats what a good family ppo plan costs ! ), 
  obamacare is deceptive - the premiums are only the tip of the cost iceberg . 
  now , they can buy it but it attempts to dump them when they get sick with huge costs which many americans have no idea are waiting for them , [ access , affordability , and insurance complexity are often worse in the united states compared to 10 other countries ] ( http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/in-the-literature/2013/nov/access-affordability-and-insurance.aspx ) [ new study : u.s. 
  ranks last among high-income nations on preventable deaths , lagging behind as others improve more rapidly : up to 84,000 lives annually could be saved if the u.s. 
  lowered its preventable death rate to that of the top three performing nations ] ( http://www.commonwealthfund.org/news/news-releases/2011/sep/us-ranks-last-on-preventable-deaths.aspx )  * `` but anyway , it amazes me that you 've made it your mission to come to / r/europe , say fuck-all about european politics or events , and just hijack every discussion to be about domestic american politics . 
  '' * do n't we get to care about other people 's welfare on this web site ? 
  given that the us is trying to deceive americans about the ftas and then deceive europeans about the `` success '' of us health care , i think my telling the truth qualifies as caring - a lot . 
  i seem to care a lot more about europeans than you do here . 
  its a fact that * many , many , many americans can not afford to go to the doctor . 
  * can it get any clearer than that ? 
  you 're evading the issues . 
  have you read [ this paper ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) ? 
  here is a [ video of its author ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwbzz070m-k ) discussing single payer vs. `` public option '' taken a few weeks before he suddenly died . 
  health insurance ? 
  related article : [ ttip - four letters that spell rising poverty ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/martin-whitlock/ttip-business-poverty_b_5915844.html ) also , a long list of [ ttip updates ] ( http://www.computerworlduk.com/blogs/open-enterprise/ttip-updates--the-glyn-moody-blogs-3569438/ ), 
  i do n't think so . 
  for one thing , the us has a huge number of people who basically are uninsurable , people with chronic illnesses . . 
  the obamacare boosters made a conscious decision from the start to abandon them . 
  and lied about it , presenting a fake `` public option '' ( which as you will see was barred by gats ) as bait to get [ single payer ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/resources/pnhp-research-the-case-for-a-national-health-program ) off the table - ( which would cover everybody but dump the whole private insurance model - also it would bargain from a position of strength on drugs , a [ very big part ] ( http://www.bilaterals.org/?+-medicines-+ ) of us trade policy is fighting such bargaining by other countries ) it was such a shameless deception , hidden and remains hidden . 
  there has never been anything which even remotely resembles a discussion . 
  the fake * '' [ public option ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwbzz070m-k ) '' * , as well as subsequent semi [ explicit promises ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) that obamacare is `` stepping stone to single payer '' were basically dangled baits - which were impossible , as they were public and as such are actually barred by the gats and other pending treaties . . see [ paper ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) linked below . 
  also , read up on what `` standstill '' means in the trade agreement context , trade agreements standstills block any new public services - they have a clause which blocks them . 
  i think this is mentioned in the article i posted a link to in the previous thread about ttip and the fact that most of its gains are from one industry alone - i posted it yesterday . . read this paper which will give you the story up until early 2009 : *** [ the potential impact of the world trade organization 's general agreement on trade in services on health system reform and regulation in the united states ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) *** gats - signed in 1995 had/has a *** standstill *** that freezes public services at the 1995 level , that is the high water mark of public services in the us that can not be exceeded . . tisa - i am pretty sure , actually * extends the 1995 standstill * . . all of the ftas have these standstill clauses . 
  so , many americans are going to have problems affording to see doctors here in america , because a fever is `` curative care '' which means it has to be paid for in a short amount of time and thats money many people do not have . . 
  it costs them hundreds of dollars to see a doctor . . - yes , it counts against a deductible which can be up to around $ 6000 for an individual or $ 12000 for a family , thats on top of the premiums - contrast this with what they had before . . 
  some huge percentage of people in obamacare ( maybe 3/4 ) - until quite recently - had much more generous employer * group * plans - people who had employer insurance before - now suddenly have to reach huge deductibles ( in many cases thousands of dollars ) before the insurer kicks in anything . 
  before they might have had a $ 10 or $ 20 co pay . 
  many of them still dont realize this , it seems . 
  they dont understand this important fact until they have to deal with it . 
  also , there is something called [ drive by doctoring ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/us/drive-by-doctoring-surprise-medical-bills.html?_r=0 ) where people often get huge out of network bills . . which insurers wont pay a penny of . 
  we americans are really getting a bad deal on health care and drugs and we 're being lied to to keep it in place - probably because of the 3 secret trade deals they are pushing right now . 
  none of which any more than 1 % of the country , if that , knows about at all . 
  its a mess , the health care situation is killing a lot of people because they ca n't get health care . . its totally unsustainable . 
  here is some more proof . . google the phrase [ `` stepping stone to single payer '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q= '' `` stepping + stone + to + single + payer '' ), 
  whatever happens in europe , i would expect it to be worse in the us where more and more people ca n't afford to go to the doctor . 
  ( shhhhh ! ), 
  however , i think that * the ebola virus * is n't as communicable as it would need to be to become a major pandemic , in other places than africa , unless some non-human host becomes a reservoir for it . . for the reasons discussed endlessly elsewhere . 
  what about underwear ? 
  will they be checking ? 
  maybe people will be asked to wear it on the outside , as many did in the 1980s . . ( showing my age here ) will people have to queue up for underwear inspections ? 
  i could see that leading to a lot of buying of nicer chinese underwear . 
  seems almost like a `` fit made in heaven '' for them . 
  well , we should care about all diseases because they are like wars , they have a huge human cost , epidemics can set nations back decades or even centuries . 
  sometimes , they have positive effects , on some level , for example , the black death spelled the beginning of the end for the divine right of kings and feudalism . 
  ... whatever . . 
  no , i 'm sorry , you 're misinformed . 
  they had multimillion dollar companies . 
  they came out ahead , they made a lot of money , they are still well known and they went on to other things , but their aspirations were ultimately frustrated by a system that is extremely good - and rapidly getting better - at stealing from people . 
   when has there ever been more innovation in the entirety of human history ? 
  no , really , can you name a single point in time where there was more rapid technological development than today ? 
  are you trying to say that the innovation is due to any particular group or idea ? 
  wrong . 
  it 's just what happens . 
  there has never been a time when there was more growth in knowledge than now because of something that has nothing to do with politics whatsoever : ** [ exponential growth in technology ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accelerating_change ) ** . . the more we learn , the still more we learn , faster . 
  visualize a line which started out horizontal and which is ** rapidly ** turning vertical . 
  problem is , the way things are set up now , at least here , if you are a small inventor , with a great idea , you can almost guarantee that whatever your idea is , it will get stolen from you and you 'll be left bankrupted if you try to defend it . 
  thats what things have come to here now . 
  not many americans realize that , unfortunately . 
  seriously . 
  i have explored this issue in depth . 
  we live in a kleptocracy that is preventing people from inventing . 
  unless they are already really wealthy they would probably be well advised to wait until something changes or move somewhere else . 
  venture capital will also try to steal your idea and will probably succeed . 
  i have had a number of friends who that has happened to . 
  much better prepared than i to deal with them , but , they still won . 
  the future does n't look as bright for the actual innovators right now as the powers that be would have us believe . 
  what can we all do to end our planet 's dependence on fossil fuels ? 
  perhaps they were trying to pick up emanations from the electronics in the swedish plane ? 
  using some kind of [ software defined radio ] ( / r/rtlsdr ), 
  you do n't get it . 
  thats a good argument for having the nhs be public , in addition to it being cheaper !, 
  here in the us , we 're seeing `` crowd out '' where the cost of health care is literally pushing other kinds of spending out of the picture . 
  so they are pushing grossly inadequate insurance so that people dont have to pay thousands of dollars a month for insurance , but the effect of that is that when something happens , they they really get hit with huge costs and many families are bankrupted , lose their homes , etc. . 
  what about crowd-out ? 
  here in the us health insurance and drug costs , huge out of pocket and out of network , and drug copay costs are crowding out a lot of other spending . 
  hundreds of millions of people can not afford to spend money on anything else when you give two industries such carte blanche to take and take and take . 
  to the exclusion of others .
