  i just saw that the uk is being presented with the * nhs reinstatement bill 2015 * this was mentioned on allyson pollock 's twitter, 
  no , thats not what i 'm saying at all . 
  we should try to figure out solutions . 
  we ca n't pretend that global standards of human decency are n't rising . 
  despite attempts to `` freeze '' or roll back standards in ftas . . they are generally rising , and its for a reason , our knowledge of how important many things are and how interconnected the world is , is rising . 
  prosperity is win win . . wars and epidemics are big black hole that sets the world back decades or in some cases , centuries or even longer . 
  ( like the huge santorini volcanic eruption in 1600 bc arguably set back progress and literacy and public health in the mediterranean almost a thousand years ) but i 'm getting off track - maybe they cant get what they want but they should get what they need . 
  which is n't necessarily that expensive . 
  suppose a peaceful alternative in northern africa was created , it would become a magnet for positive things . 
  an experiment in problem solving . 
  the land grab by big agribusiness thats going on now is the very worst kind of post-colonialism colonialism . 
  what if - the gulf stream stopped moderating the climate in europe ? 
  many europeans would then want to move to northern africa , which would be - as it was a few thousand years ago ( 6000 ) much much wetter . 
  or , what if europe or north america or siberia became much warmer ? 
  actually , siberia is getting warmer , it seems . 
  or what if the whole world got colder ? 
  thats what happens after big volcanic eruptions , or basaltic volcanism . 
  google snowball earth , its not clear what caused that , i think . 
  we just do n't know everything , * the more we know the more we learn faster , but also , the more we realize we do n't know , too * ... we ca n't predict the future and we should always keep the inherent unpredictability of nature in mind . 
  so , the world should join together to find someplace where the climate migrants in each area can all live and farm or something . 
  maybe somewhere in north africa . 
  ** buy it , buy the land , so its not a land grab ** the world can create a new country , or a string of new countries , hopefully ones which are not corrupt . 
  then take the money which would have been spent on supporting them in the eu or elsewhere and use it to fund infrastructure there . 
  keep in mind that global climate change is unpredictable enough that we all really should be better to one another , we all , meaning the entire human race , need each other more than we think . 
  ultimately , whatever is learned from this experiment could be used to good effect in space , to help us successfully move out of our comfort zone into the rest of the universe . 
  if we can not deal with climate change , we dont deserve to be able to go into space . 
  if we ca n't deal with climate change , we 'll most certainly screw that up . 
  we cant hide something like that . 
  whatever we do with our climate change issue and the responsibility that places on us to help one another , ( and not just human beings , either ) will weigh heavily on our future success as part of the greater world which is the universe . 
  they have a web page at http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/tories-in-15-billion-nhs-sell-off-scandal/ where these particular companies and politicians - and the unite organizational media contacts are listed . . 
  but , this is a very old story . . 
  the conflicts of interest between uk ( and us , and eu ) legislators and the huge multinational corporations which stand to benefit greatly by free trade agreements - are huge and growing - remember the privatizations in eastern europe , which were all hugely corrupt and the main beneficiaries were organized crime ? 
  privatizations which all those countries * are still paying a huge price for * . . * `` free trade agreements '' have embedded `` ratchet '' `` standstill '' . . etc. . * which force the gradual , incremental privatization by stealth of national public healthcare systems , raising the costs of healthcare , medicines and giving corporations entitlements to the illicit profits that can not ever be ended without the taxpayers paying massive compensation to them for their `` expropriated property '' . 
  the term for the tort that is argued when a government regulates in the public interest and the corporations demand compensation for that `` change '' is `` indirect expropriation '' . 
  the name for the one way nature of the ftas is `` ratchet '' the name for the blockade which blocks any return to public services is `` standstill '' for example , gats has a standstill clause which you can actually read , here . 
  http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/gats_03_e.htm#comm so , * one corrupt government can silently make these changes and that creates a unbreakable noose which gradually privatizes the entire market segment , irreversibly * . 
  then often those former officials - now major stockholders of the companies that their actions themselves gave them entitlements to remain . . and to no reversing out of the privatization trap . . ( edit : for an eye-opening look at what i mean by no reversing , read this case between a dutch insurer and slovakia http://www.italaw.com/cases/417 http://www.italaw.com/cases/2564 ) for their brief assistance , the revolving door officials often then get to cash in . 
  hows that for mens rea ? 
  these politicians/companies are [ listed here ] ( http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/tories-in-15-billion-nhs-sell-off-scandal/ ) . 
  the issue has been pointed out again and again , and the connections - everywhere - seem to be getting more and more brazen . 
  its similar to the last 20 years in the us , do n't go down this path unless you want to end up like us which is a very horrible place for people . 
  people are being bankrupted right and left by medical bills , and almost all of them have `` insurance '' . 
  its a trap , the ftas are designed to take even the smallest privatization and turn it into the destruction of the entire public healthcare system . 
  read '' [ putting health first ] ( http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/putting_health_first.pdf ) '' which explains the ( wto ) gats , ( which the upcoming tisa is based on . ), 
  tisa is the one which is going to privatize * services * globally . 
  not ttip . 
  that fact alone should tell you something . 
  you should n't fault newspapers for reporting something that important , or pretend that anybody can report such things without name calling because its a very important piece of information that people need to know . 
  here in the us we have the same problem . 
  the huge corporations are literally in bed with legislators . 
  ( as in spouses are lobbyists for some of them ), 
  `` follow the money '' , investigative reporters often say . 
  edit : here is their press release - http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/tories-in-15-billion-nhs-sell-off-scandal/ which lists the corporations and politicians they are exposing the links between . 
  edit2 : i just found this much longer list - [ this other list i found via google ] ( http://socialinvestigations.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/compilation-of-parliamentary-financial.html ) and have no other information on it 's ` provenance ' . 
  somewhere on my computers i have a pdf chart which came from a much more reliable source - and basically uses graphviz to draw this huge chart of interconnections . 
  its several years old . . 
  i forget what its named . . 
  but i do remember its big . 
  this is the one i just found . . http://socialinvestigations.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/compilation-of-parliamentary-financial.html, 
  she was a bit senile . 
  reagan was too . 
  if they can make it profitable they should be able to do it . 
  an international ban with no exceptions is very much needed . 
  they could end up starting wwiii, 
  he asked if we had any proof that the dprk was much more militaristic than the usa . 
  yes , we do . 
  we have unequivocal proof in excess . 
  we have seen the prison camps and their kill zones from space with our own eyes , ( you can too , right now . 
  recent increases in resolution allow you to see the barbed wire and electric fence insulators . . 
  install google earth and then pm me . ), 
  * if you read the accounts you 'll see that their government attempts to rationalize virtually all of their human rights abuse and sacrifices they force the nation to endure using the most shameless militaristic arguments * . 
  let me give you an extreme example ( that i am certain you will think i 'm making up - and i forgive you in advance for it . . because nobody believe this , nor will you believe me when i tell you that ive been following this issue for 15 years and have been hearing these stories since the late 90s and they come from a lot of sources who have no reason to make it up . 
  interviews with people who have recently arrived in south korea who in almost all cases are just everyday people . . some of them have horrendous scars from torture on their bodies . 
  that are consistent with what they tell us . 
  most recently , a large number of women , who were interviewed about not about that , but about women 's rights in the dprk . 
  they brought the issue up themselves . 
  the most recent emergence of it for the first time outside of individual 's life stories - was not meant to be about that , it emerged spontaneously , but as i said i had heard it several times before - its been mentioned for years . 
  i had even heard about this island hospital , its commonly known there that this really horrible thing happens - what happens ? - ** they justify their use of disabled children - ( even children of favored members of the `` core '' songbun groups ! ), 
  in chemical and biological weapons `` research '' and vivisection by saying that they would be `` more useful to the nation '' being poisoned and then dissected alive than anything else they could do ** . 
  ** this is because that is framed by the government as a national defense issue . 
  effective satire because it makes us think ... we all know what it makes us think, 
  is this the 50 + year old propaganda organ ? 
  how bizarre, 
  landmines should be banned . 
  i really would like to see the world speak up for the right of people to determine their own futures . 
  ** peoples rights and the principle of universal human suffrage and representative government should take precedence over dirty deals between countries over superficial things like property leases . 
   well , i guess if you have to draw on a crack-pot authoritian regime with a hereditary line based on a god mythos and a starving population forced into military service . . well , i guess in that case ok .  edit : but do you have any proof that north korea has an active martial culture like the us ? 
  imo : what they have is much , much more militaristic than anything in the us .

  http://nkdb.org/bbs1/data/publication/political_prison_camp_in_north_korea_today.pdf http://nkdb.org/bbs1/data/kornkbdpaper/survey_report_on_political_prisoners_camp_in_north_korea_final_edit_5.pdf hrnk has also compiled a great deal of information , which makes extensive use of satellite imagery - http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/hrnk_hiddengulag2_web_5-18.pdf http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/nkhiddengulag_davidhawk ( 2 ) . pdf http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/hrnk_ken-gause_translation_5_29_13.pdf the first report from an inmate , venezuelan poet ali lameda who had been released ( as a personal favor to romanian dictator nikolai ceaucescu ) ali lameda : '' [ a personal account of a prisoner of conscience in the democratic people 's republic of korea ] ( http://www.amnesty.org/ar/library/asset/asa24/002/1979/en/0045d95d-bdab-47e0-a08c-dc969d5db2ae/asa240021979en.pdf ) '' amnesty international ( 1976 ) this is the historic first personal account by a westerner of the dprk 's prison conditions, 
  the first thing that people would say , look at hitler 's '' [ blitzkrieg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blitzkrieg ) '' however , a modern army defending their own homeland have a lot of potential tricks which they could use perhaps to make it a very costly advance . 
  poland might want to look at the defenses which north korea has set up to prevent tanks using highways . 
  all their roads have these very large concrete constructions along them which have pre-placed charges in them . 
  at a moments notice those charges can be detonated blocking that highway from any use for a very long time . 
  they should analyze where this can be done to get the maximum effect from it . 
  concrete is cheap . 
  most americans have no idea what 's being done in our names . 
  for example , most americans would be extremely angry to hear that the us is trying to use trade with the us as a lever to force other countries to privatize healthcare . 
  the `` free trade agreements '' are completely unknown to americans . 
  not ignored , unknown .
