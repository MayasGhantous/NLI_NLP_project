  america 's biggest disappointment too . 
  he pretends to be a liberal with huge pr efforts to turn largely superficial acts into unquestioning narrow , media coverage , and then behind closed doors he works to push a right wing neoliberal agenda that almost no americans are aware of and which most of us would disagree with . 
  look at how they sold `` obamacare '' and hide the free trade agreements , for example . 
  [ reid says obamacare just a step toward eventual single-payer system - las vegas sun news ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) must see . 
  something about *** genocide *** seems to rub a lot of people the wrong way , for some reason . 
  no , its not . 
  the media coverage that leave it out is . 
  very interesting ,, 
  what are your feelings on transparency ? 
  i live in the us where - were it not for ccpa , and one other us ngo , i would not have even known about gats or what is clearly an attack on public services globally . 
  so many things now , here , at least , revolve around various fta arguing positions taken by the us which are not widely known outside of the trade community . 
  were it not for ccpa 's , public citizen , tni , and a few other ngos , well written pubs , i would not know this issue existed . 
  i discovered quite a bit from the ccpa and public citizen pubs . 
  so many things that are going on in us politics at their core relate to trade policy but that fact is aggressively hidden . 
  its a crime how much we are being deceived . 
  in the us , there is never any mention of the underlying loss of policy space caused by ftas . 
  never . 
  so , that omission literally turns every politician into a liar . 
  because they all pretend there are other reasons for things - reasons that in all probability are just made up . 
  for example , gats 's standstill has blocked public services since 1998 . 
  only trade experts know that . 
  that lack of knowledge enables a lot of dishonest behavior . 
  for an example , google the phrase `` stepping stone to single payer '' now watch how this comment gets drownvoted . 
  this is a vitally important issue that absolutely nobody who does not live in the us is going to pick up because the media outside the us is going to fill in the holes and europeans or canadians just wont understand where those holes are for that reason . 
  did the russian media avoided honest reporting of accurate numbers ? 
  a few years ago i think i remember reading a series of articles comparing the actual demonstrations to the reporting of them . 
  have n't they had huge demonstrations in russia protesting obviously fixed elections , arrests of opposition figures , etc ? 
  they have . 
  is the uk turning into kansas ? 
  science uses metric !, 
  for good reason . 
  the good thing is that he 's being brought to justice , finally . 
  imo , the reason we are losing jobs is * deregulation and disinvestment in society * . 
  i do n't think the ftas framing of almost every act of democracy as `` regulation '' and it framing the work of democracies as `` non tariff barriers '' to be eliminated , is desirable . 
  ** democracy created the wealth that buys the products of industry . 
  ** ** if we want a actual recovery , we need more , not less democracy . 
  ** with that fact in mind , what would you suggest to bring about a real recovery , if you could ? 
  omg - have you ever driven by one of those places ? 
  you can smell them from many miles away . 
  driving cross country here in the us , in the middle of the country on major highways , you can often smell them - those places are just huge , i have no idea how big but they must be just huge , and their smell travels so very far . 
  its the worst smell you have ever smelled , ever . 
  would you be willing to bet `` reddit gold '' ( pending acknowledgement that its okay ) i am willing to bet you . 
  i will win if the situation described in the [ resilient societies nrc petition ] ( https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf ) and the greater problem illustrated by fukushima of meltdowns occurring in light water reactors when power is lost for any extended period , is true ... is at its core fundamentally true . 
  you will win if its `` complete nonsense '' as you put it . 
  i am arguing that the risk to all of us - to human safety presented by solar storms shutting down the entire global power grid and the likelihood of multiple nuclear meltdowns due to sudden loss of the `` ultimate heat sink '' ( cooling capacity ) is substantial enough that it has been acknowledged that we ( the us ) must now take concrete steps to investigate *** and develop a plan that addresses it *** in our own light water fission reactors . 
  they probably hate the hkers because they are a fairly articulate group of young people with a clear set of demands which sound utterly reasonable to outsiders . 
  they certainly do deserve some way to escape china if china gets worse , maybe dual citizenship ? 
  what kind of engineering ? 
   there are even jobs that i know of personally ( us south , engineering field ) that will pay off student debt 100 % as a signing bonus . 
  but relaying that is honestly hazardously close to starting a stemjerk so i 'll stop there . 
  no referendum on `` free trade '' `` agreements ? '', 
  its not at all clear in the article where this island is or what its legal status is . 
  meat needs to be kept clean and cold , thats not such a big thing , or should n't be . . - but factory farms are not known for their cleanliness - thats why they use chlorine as a disinfectant, 
  you know what is at issue here - a lot more than dangerous bacteria and factory farming ... its power trying to buy science . 
  this is a good place to start - ciel - http://www.ciel.org/publications/toxicpartnership_mar2014.pdf http://libcloud.s3.amazonaws.com/93/c7/2/3299/ciel_submission_on_ttip_sentate_finance_committee_hearing-clean.pdf http://www.ciel.org/chem/ec_science_19aug2014.html `` at a time when scientific opinion is central to eu policy making and legislative processes , the idea of a single person secretly advising the commission on all science related matters , from climate change , to toxic chemicals , gmos , fracking and fisheries , is not only unscientific , it is also in direct contradiction to the democratic process enshrined by the european union , '' says david azoulay , senior attorney at the center for international environmental law ( ciel ) . 
  `` it is critical that eu lawmakers have access to the best representation of wide-ranging and transparent scientific advice to carry out their work ; asking one single person to secretly determine what science ` is ' on a subject is a grave mistake . '', 
  you should actually be the person you try to convince others you are - even if that means you learn something . 
  what they really need is the ability to rule themselves . 
  corporations ( `` functional constituencies '' ) have the vote in hong kong , but people do n't !, 
  relevant !,

  people should know that far less than one percent of my fellow americans have any idea of what the word neoliberalism is . 
  almost none of us have ever heard of ttip/tafta , tisa , and the tiny number who have heard about tpp , only have the vaguest idea what it is due to almost zero news coverage in the us media . 
  also , obama was sold to americans as a `` liberal '' which in the us means left wing . 
  his privatization of health care was sold by telling americans it was a '' [ stepping stone to single payer ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) '' ( public health care ) . 
  the corporate interests who seem to be substituting their own interests for those of the general public as the determinant of policy in both the us and the eu . 
  the neolib dem party sold neoliberal obama and his privatization of health care by telling we americans it was a `` stepping stone to single payer '' health care - ( public health care , of all things ) well , guess what , they lied !, 
  ( of course ) to prevent any kind of discussion of real public health care and the subsequent discovery of [ the fta , health care connection ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) . 
  they prevented any kind of insight . 
  also , not even 1 % of all americans have even heard of tisa , ttip , tpp , etc. 
  the agriculture is the most crucial issue , there still is enough water to drink , i think . 
  but , as i said , these huge droughts happen , even without global warming , which probably makes it worse , according to noaa . 
  [ this petition explains why we need to phase out the kinds of nuclear power we have now ] ( https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf ) . 
  everybody should read this . 
  its about solar storms causing a global nightmare where dozens of nuclear power plants all melt down at the same time . 
  did you read the [ successful nrc petition ] ( https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf ) about the meltdown threat posed to the whole world by one solar storm just like the ones we 've already had in the recent past - obviously not !, 
  i 've been told that corruption cultivates/promotes apathy . 
  literally . 
  i have read that massive tax evasion by corporations and very wealthy individuals is the reason greece has so much trouble . 
  period . 
  so austerity is completely inappropriate . 
  are the powers that be abandoning the people of our own countries futures - perhaps trading them for the quite unpredictable gamble of access as a local to asia and africa where they see more growth ? 
  they seem to me to be going in that direction more than not . 
  i cant see another explanation . 
  if so , i think that is profoundly stupid . 
  i know that the big expansion of fracking they are planning is also going to include huge increases in workers from companies in other countries , probably as subcontractors or sub-subcontractors . 
  also , education . 
  this is why we 've seen so much push to privatize education a little bit , because of the intentionally little known gats which will then require it be completely privatized . 
  see wto/gats governmental services exception - how narrow it is . 
  its not migration , its temporary . 
  also , the employer 's relationship will be with the contracting companies , the contracting companies will deal with their sub contractors , and they will deal with their sub-sub contractors . 
  eventually you 'll get to individual people . 
  who will be much less able to have any influence on anything . 
  also , us and eu and australian workers will suddenly be directly competing with foreign firms for work . 
  google `` control fraud '' `` regulatory capture '' etc. 
  for what we have now in us/eu . 
  back to tisa . 
  i think it should be obvious that its plan is to create a club which the developing countries will feel they have to join and then offer jobs with a high perceived value in the `` rich countries '' as a trade for access to the growing markets with `` national treatment '' privileges . 
  ( the quietly more and more corrupt governments in the developed countries are trying to maintain and make more onerous the hierarchy at all costs . ), 
  they are trying to portray it as meaning that people in the developed countries will be brought in to offices elsewhere to train , etc , but what they are of course going to do is use it to improve their balance of payments which means large scale privatization of services and then mandating procurement procedures which allow corporations from trading parters equal opportunity to bid .
