  nuclear power plants are designed to disconnect automatically from the grid in the event of a local power failure or major grid anomaly ; once disconnected , they begin the process of shutting down the reactor 's core . 
  in the event of the loss of coolant flow to an active nuclear reactor 's core , the reactor will start to melt down and fail catastrophically within a matter of a few hours , at most . 
  in an extreme gmd , nearly every reactor in the world could be affected . 
  it was a short-term cooling-system failure that caused the partial reactor core meltdown in march 1979 at three mile island , pennsylvania . 
  similarly , according to japanese authorities , it was not direct damage from japan 's 9.0 magnitude tohoku earthquake on march 11 , 2011 , that caused the fukushima daiichi nuclear reactor disaster , but the loss of electric power to the reactor 's cooling system pumps when the reactor 's backup batteries and diesel generators were wiped out by the ensuing tidal waves . 
  in the hours and days after the tidal waves shuttered the cooling systems , the cores of reactors number 1 , 2 and 3 were in full meltdown and released hydrogen gas , fueling explosions which breached several reactor containment vessels and blew the roof off the building housing reactor number 4 's spent-fuel storage pond . 
  of even greater danger and concern than the reactor cores themselves are the spent fuel rods stored in on-site cooling ponds . 
  lacking a permanent spent nuclear fuel storage facility , so-called `` temporary '' nuclear fuel containment ponds are features common to nearly all nuclear reactor facilities . 
  they typically contain the accumulated spent fuel from ten or more decommissioned reactor cores . 
  due to lack of a permanent repository , most of these fuel containment ponds are greatly overloaded and tightly packed beyond original design . 
  they are generally surrounded by common light industrial buildings with concrete walls and corrugated steel roofs . 
  unlike the active reactor cores , which are encased inside massive `` containment vessels '' with thick walls of concrete and steel , the buildings surrounding spent fuel rod storage ponds would do practically nothing to contain radioactive contaminants in the event of prolonged cooling system failures . 
  since spent fuel ponds typically hold far greater quantities of highly radioactive material then the active nuclear reactors locked inside reinforced containment vessels , they clearly present far greater potential for the catastrophic spread of highly radioactive contaminants over huge swaths of land , polluting the environment for multiple generations . 
  a study by the nuclear regulatory commission ( nrc ) determined that the `` boil down time '' for spent fuel rod containment ponds runs from between 4 and 22 days after loss of cooling system power before degenerating into a fukushima-like situation , depending upon the type of nuclear reactor and how recently its latest batch of fuel rods had been decommissioned . 
  [ 9 ] reactor fuel rods have a protective zirconium cladding , which , if superheated while exposed to air , will burn with intense , self-generating heat , much like a magnesium fire , releasing highly radioactive aerosols and smoke . 
  according to nuclear whistleblower and former senior vice president for nuclear engineering services arnie gundersen , once a zirconium fire has started , due to its extreme temperatures and high reactivity , contact with water will result in the water dissociating into hydrogen and oxygen gases , which will almost certainly lead to violent explosions . 
  gundersen says that once a zirconium fuel rod fire has started , the worst thing you could do is to try to quench the fire with water streams , which would cause violent explosions . 
  gundersen believes the massive explosion that blew the roof off the spent fuel pond at fukushima was caused by zirconium-induced hydrogen dissociation . 
  [ 10 ] had it not been for heroic efforts on the part of japan 's nuclear workers to replenish waters in the spent fuel pool at fukushima , those spent fuel rods would have melted down and ignited their zirconium cladding , which most likely would have released far more radioactive contamination than what came from the three reactor core meltdowns . 
  japanese officials have estimated that fukushima daiichi has already released just over half as much total radioactive contamination as was released by chernobyl into the local environment , but other sources estimate it could be significantly more than at chernobyl . 
  in the event of an extreme gmd-induced long-term grid collapse covering much of the globe , if just half of the world 's spent fuel ponds were to boil off their water and become radioactive , zirconium-fed infernos , the ensuing contamination could far exceed the cumulative effect of 400 chernobyls .

  both nasa and the nrc agree that [ this ] ( https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf ) is a substantial risk . 
  they won . 
  its real . 
  their argument was compelling , get it ? 
  you can read that in the federal register . 
  us unemployment figures are a fraction of what they would be if americans has the eu 's safety net . 
  it does n't , so i would say at least half , probably much more of america 's unemployed people are n't counted as unemployed . 
  also , now there must be at least 10 or 15 million people who live in rvs and similar and basically have no real home . 
  tisa is a lot like gats , but much more aggressive in terms of scope ... 
  the us had high hopes that gats would private a lot more than it did , probably the biggest effects of gats has been in the us because the us being the primary zealots behind the ideology have to impose it on ourselves . 
  so no sweetheart deals for us on rx drugs , or public health care just because a hundred thousand people are dying a year because they cant afford it.nor has there been even a shred of honesty about this hidden ratchet tightening around the country 's future . 
  also , tisa is probably where all the services stuff is . 
  when you hear assurances that x wont be in ttip , what that really almost certainly means not that its not being done . 
  you would be wise to assume nothing . 
  it probably will be in tisa . 
  they are desperate people and desperate people do desperate things . 
  we 're all being ruled by compulsive liars so , to answer your question , no , tisa is not immigration reform , however tisa will allow corporations to move their staff from wherever to wherever they want and countries have to let them . 
  its modeled on gats - the fourth mode of gats supply , temporary movement of the labor commodity . 
  when labor contracts come up for renewal , they will be put into an international database - a procurement bidding system , forcing a huge percentage of all jobs in the member countries to privatize big chunks of whats currently public , so they are all then forced to do their procurements through a process which will allow any corporation in the member countries to bid , so there will be an incredible ** and very hierarchical ** web of subcontractors and sub sub contractors and sub sub sub contractors , all with the idea of making the powers that be in all of them even richer than they are today . 
  so jobs will be traded like chips in a poker game . 
  if they remained public services , they could never be traded like that . 
  also , there will be almost zero accountability . 
  public education is clearly in the sights for massive privatization . 
  so the ftas attempt to mandate a one way ** ratchet ** ever tightening privatizations triggered by every act , every event , every movement of any kind . 
  ratchet = core concept also , standstill , `` indirect expropriation '' `` investor-state dispute settlement '' ( isds ) `` trade barrier '' `` market access barrier '' `` trade distorting subsidy '' and dozens of others . 
  one goal seems to be to create an impossible trap that entangles the non-corporate world inextricably before it becomes fully aware of this even happening . . or perhaps to eliminate any vestigial moral frameworks or sense of shared wealth or common sense or human dignity or human rights or justice , that might get in the way of the most extreme mercantile dominion possible . 
  they are really working as hard and as fast as they can . 
  this is their 3rd attempt . 
  basically , god = profit . 
  its a symptom of large numbers of families falling off the edge of the world, 
  i 'm in the us . 
  it would make more sense to not have summer vacations and instead have lots of very short breaks and try to set up jobs for students that they could do at the same time . . - co-ops or something . . 
  i saw you trying to imply that the us is in better shape and that the us model that is much worse than the statistics might indicate , is better , and its simply not true . 
  both americans and europeans are being lied to in really destructive ways . 
  lots of people do n't get jobs right away if ever . 
  the kind of jobs most of earth has had until recently , are vanishing . 
  all around the world . 
  technology s doing those jobs cheaper and better . 
  so , people should go to school , but we have to accept , that unless we change , and invest a great deal more in education , that it should be for the knowledge 's sake . 
  its unlikely that even a four year degree in many fields will lead to anything approaching a guarantee of economic security . 
  more and more of society - and this will happen in developed countries earlier than elsewhere - will eventually be forced to live on very little if any work . 
  where do the kids go in the summer and over christmas ? 
  do n't count your chickens , before they hatch !, 
  https://www.indybay.org/uploads/2013/03/01/800_2013_world_lng_prices.jpg what about all the energy which may be needed to desalinate water for the southwest ? 
  every several hundred years there is a huge , many many decades long drought in the us southwest . 
  the last time it happened , it destroyed the anasazi - before they vanished ino the distant south ( and the hopi mesas ) they descended into cannibalism http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2014/09/02/california-megadrought/14446195/ americans are already unable to afford heating and cooling . 
  the huge energy cost increase that would come from the [ bad ttip energy ] ( http://action.sierraclub.org/site/docserver/analysis_of_eu_energy_proposal_ttip.pdf?docid=15744 ) ~ scam ~ ~ ~ ~ bailout ~ ~ would literally destroy this country . 
  more like aum shinrikyo or . . < censored , 
  good, 
  just say know ~ ~ no ~ ~, 
  kids are n't idiots . 
  they know how stacked the odds are against them now . 
  whatever they can do to stay in school and get the best education they can is smart . 
  in 20 years , the workplace is going to be very very very different than it is today . 
  much much more competitive , for the number of jobs that will exist . 
  they will be competing against the whole world for each job . 
  people will need to be extremely good at whatever they do to get paid for it . 
  and it going to take a quarter to a third of their lives to get that good . 
  once they get a job , many will probably be supporting their entire extended family . 
  because jobs will be very scarce . 
  wages will keep falling , too . 
  i 'm just saying , its your choice . 
  kind of like that stupid scene in `` the matrix '' . 
  http://www.italaw.com/cases/2101 not in their own countries https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4, 
  smart , or dumb ? 
  they should concentrate on renewable energy !, 
  anything is better than a [ global nuclear meltdown ] ( https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf ) in the next big solar storm . 
  we just missed one two years ago . 
  [ read this ] ( https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf ), 
  [ read this ] ( https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf ) , then apologize . 
  see no evil hear no evil . . speak no evil, 
  i did n't misrepresent it . 
  you are , because tisa is part of the plan and you 're pretending tisa doesnt exist . 
  the german greens know one thing you do n't and that is that we could easily be thrust tomorrow into an [ unspeakable disaster of dozens of simultaneous nuclear meltdowns ] ( https://www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/natureandnukes/petrulemaking262011.pdf ) if we get another solar storm like the `` carrington '' one in 1859 . 
  so , we need to wind down the fission reactors and focus on renewable energy and - as far as nuclear goes - nuclear fusion - not fission , because we dont have an acceptable fission and we should n't waste energy trying to find one because its likely to not deliver what we could get elsewhere . 
  we have no good way of dealing with the waste - no way that does n't have major problems . 
  for the problem - google ** `` loss of the ultimate heat sink '' ** `` resilient societies '' carrington etc. 
  i hope that they come up with an innovative solution that balances the various interests acceptably . 
  ftas attempt to pit the people of the world against one another so they do n't see the bigger picture as they fight for survival .
