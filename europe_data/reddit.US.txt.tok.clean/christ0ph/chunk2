  will these newly unemployed workers have any chance of finding alternative jobs ? 
  the cepr study is by definition unable to predict ttip 's net impact on employment levels , as the model used in its analysis assumes a fixed supply of labour . 
   * `` the european commission , however , admits in its own impact assessment that the effect of the job losses from ttip will be ` prolonged and substantial ' . 
  at a time when unemployment rates in europe already stand at record levels , the commission recognizes the ` legitimate concerns ' that those workers who lose their jobs as a result of ttip will not be able to find other employment . 
  '' *  * `` that is not all . 
  ttip poses a recognized threat to labour standards , undermining the quality as well as the quantity of available work . 
  ttip also aims to open up public procurement and public service contracts , threatening workers ' rights by means of increased privatization . 
  popular ` buy american ' provisions aimed at protecting local jobs in us states have been explicitly targeted for removal by eu negotiators , promising further mayhem . 
  '' *  * `` ttip will be a disaster for working men and women on both sides of the atlantic . 
  anyone under the illusion that it could be a ` gold standard ' agreement for labour should think again . 
  i think that the loss of ability to regulate is a crucial issue . 
  i do n't see how these things are seen to be `` legal '' . 
  you 're glossing over a lot of huge problems with these treaties . 
  [ `` the ttip will lead to at least a million job losses and threaten labour standards in us and eu '' ] ( http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/blogs/employment/ttip-don-t-mention-the-job-losses ),

  ] ( http://www.dw.de/with-ttip-eu-and-us-promise-a-transatlantic-trade-miracle/a-17935749 ) )  * `` and a final issue i have with all these new generation treaties is that corporations gain rights . 
  if you stand back and ask yourself who gains rights , it is not the citizens . 
  citizens in many of our countries have lost rights . 
  little rights that are sort of encased in technical aspects and most citizens do n't even realize it until it happens to them . 
  and with ttip and ttp they gain even more rights and so a lot of critical analysts are stunned by these two treaties . 
  please watch [ this video of testimony before the australian senate on 30 october 2014 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgqo2tsjqky ) which would have been two or three days ago for you , depending on when you read this . . , especially the list of cases senator richard di natale discusses at approximately 17:00 - he explains that the isds provisions stuck into these trade deals , ( isds ) will have effects which in his words `` nobody wants '' he 's questioning the wisdom of this scheme . 
  as am i. 
  [ big tobacco uses investor clauses to defend its killer products : senator richard di natale ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgqo2tsjqky ), 
  why dont you make a list of assertions which you see as `` my claims '' and if indeed they are both things that i am saying and important , i 'd be happy to try to `` prove '' them . 
  but as i have been saying for a long time , i suspect its you who is on shaky ground , factually . 
  look at the fact that matthew rimmer [ is taking approximately the same positions ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-opnhrbnme ) as i have been on isds , * and he 's being consulted as an expert by your government * . 
  that is hardly `` nuttery ''  here is another one . . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgqo2tsjqky if you look at the provider of that video youtube user `` ip observatory '' they have a substantial number of other videos with other people making related points to your australian government . 
  i do n't really understand what you see as `` my claims '' because i am just recounting the situation to you as i see it , and i am not in any way alone on this . 
  the things i am saying seem semi-obvious to me at this point . 
  well , why do n't you listen to dr matthew rimmer from the anu college of law [ giving evidence on investor-state dispute settlement ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-opnhrbnme ) to the senate committee for foreign affairs defence & trade on the 6th august 2014 ? 
  here is a document he 's written by the same name : http://works.bepress.com/matthew_rimmer/178/ also see http://www.youtube.com/user/drmatthewrimmer, 
  you 're trying to ignore the fact that even your own country-people are sick and tired of corporations using what amount to really dirty tricks with important issues that affect people 's lives . 
  its not what it seems . . 
  here is the recent testimony ( video ) go to the second page of results for seoul , and watch the video with an myong chul , its the first witness , starting at around 17:30 in the video . 
  see the problem ? 
  its my understanding that ftas are being passed that omit these contentious clauses - matthew rimmer in australia has written extensively about the options for those who wish to write [ ftas which do not have these problems ] ( http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1264&amp;context=matthew_rimmer ) . 
  cameron and the eu commission are arrogant . 
  employment numbers for people without advanced technology skill-sets will continue to decline - at accelerating rates due to exponential growth in labor saving technology . 
  that fact is not amenable to change by politicians . 
   * `` david bull , the executive director of unicef uk , said the charity was calling for an immediate review of the impact austerity measures were having on children -- suggesting that worse was to come . 
  '' *  * `` he said : `` it 's disappointing to see that 18 countries have managed to reduce levels of child poverty during that difficult economic period and the uk has seen it get worse . 
  `` if they can do it in poland , canada , germany and australia , why ca n't we ? '' * because of that very sorry conservative government in the uk that looks like some kind of parody of the worst us politicians . . 
  here in the us we now can watch uk political debate ( on cspan ) and its just - horrible to see them . 
  he says stuff which i just can not believe people let go by without a challenge . . 
  he reminds me of a very dishonest , abusive parent . 
  very bad situation . 
  plastic surgery is evil 2 . 
  asian guys are n't ugly ( nor are asian women ) 3 . 
  the only things which i dislike about korean culture are both easy to put behind you elsewhere . 
  they are - male chauvinism . 
  ( even as another male , this bothers me a lot - i expect women and men to be equals , this is not negotiable for me . . 
  i do n't like it when women expect me to be perfect either , as i 'm not . 
  also , racism in korea is a problem too i hear , both against non-asians and other asian cultures . 
  i actually think europe , particularly scandinavia , might be really a good place to move beyond that . 
  it would be like shock treatment . 
  i have no idea . 
  also , if you are lgbt i have no idea how that would be . 
  but , i do know that europeans are great people , generally . 
  and less racist than people in many other places . 
  i 'm sure that you will be able to manage - the simple fact that you are asking these questions is a good sign . 
  also , i personally prefer when asian people use their own names and dont adopt western names . 
  i would rather work to learn the asian naming style once than have my asian friends have to use an unfamiliar name . 
  germany is ahead of the curve if they are really rejecting ttip . 
  however , they have a nasty habit of bringing the same bad ideas back again and again here in the us , just with another name . 
  i would still worry until isds and ftas using it have been declared dead . 
  it is , they have a lot of info on their site , the original is worth checking out . 
  excerpt from http://ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/ttip%20jobs.html ... schwarzer also points to a recent review of ttip studies by the european parliamentary research service ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/etudes/join/2014/528798/ipol-join_et ( 2014 ) 528798_en . pdf ) which states : the regulatory core of ttip makes it extremely difficult for economists to come to grips with the expected economic meaning of the negotiation outcomes . 
  ntbs [ non-tariff barriers ] and mere regulatory heterogeneity create ` trade costs ' for market access , both ways , but it is exceedingly hard to assess authoritatively what the trade costs are , and what consequences they have , whether for goods or services . 
  yet , without good proxies of those costs and the scope for their reduction , an empirical economic analysis with proper modeling is basically impossible or mere sophisticated ` guess ' work . '' yet , at the same time , while the cepr study rules out the ability to forecast `` net employment creation or destruction '' , it does capture the `` reallocation of workers '' in a post-ttip eu , admitting that it is likely to bring `` prolonged and substantial '' dislocation to european workers as a result of its impact on different sectors : '' . . there will be sectors that will be shedding workers and that the reemployment of these workers in the expanding sectors is not automatic . . '' ( section 5.9.2 ) http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/march/tradoc_150759.pdf further analysis on this point by john hilary of war on want : http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/blogs/employment/ttip-don-t-mention-the-job-losses ` the cepr study calculates the level of displacement that ttip will bring to employment , cited as a percentage of the labour force in the eu and us . 
  under the ` ambitious ' scenario for ttip preferred by eu negotiators , the cepr reveals that at least 1.3 million european workers will lose their jobs as a direct result of the agreement . 
  in addition , over 715,000 us workers also stand to lose their jobs under this scenario , giving a total of over two million job losses in total . ', 
  going the other way hence , many fear that ttip is as likely to produce the opposite of its intended goals and may actually add to unemployment in some sectors , rendering any employment gains as negligible . 
  if ttip aims to drive down costs for consumers and increase competiveness , it is safe to suggest that this would require changes in the labour market , which may not always be positive . 
  globalization scholar saskia sassen in a recent deutsche welle interview , highlighted the flaws of this `` trade miracle '' : ( http://www.dw.de/with-ttip-eu-and-us-promise-a-transatlantic-trade-miracle/a-17935749 ) ` so yes , the household in a very sort of narrow perspective gains because they pay less , the famous example of this is of course low-cost chinese imports . 
  but the large question is does the economy in which this household ( s ) operates also gain so that you have a large shadow effect that is a benefit for a larger complex system rather than the pair of shoes that you buy for less money . 
  and there the figures are negative . 
  so the household may benefit , but it is a very particular and very short-term benefit . 
  and in the long-run the effect can be to lessen the dynamism of an economy to keep it from adding new jobs . ' as the eu and us are saturated markets , adding additional consumption through additional trade is limited . 
  instead ttip will rather redirect the flow of existing trade toward transatlantic flows , thereby reducing it in other areas . 
  as we have written , both the developing world and intra-eu trade are likely to suffer as a result . 
  http://ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/diversion%20of%20trade.html at the same time , the competitive gains reached through ttip will be measured in capital and labour . 
  with capital investment at an all time low across the eu , the aim will turn to making labour more productive -- i.e , more production with less workers . 
  jobs , at what cost ? 
  finally , there has been little attention paid to the costs to regions , governments and societies as a result of such a comprehensive deal , and the dangers of putting competitiveness ahead of all other concerns . 
  a report by \u00d6fse , the austrian foundation for development research , released in april this year , ( http://ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/ofse%20study.html ) analysed four reports on ttip [ ecorys ( 2009 ) , cepr ( 2013 ) , cepii ( 2013 ) and bertelsmann/ifo ( 2013 ) ] in an attempt to answer some of these issues . 
  it found that : costs of unemployment , including long term unemployment , might be substantial , especially during the 10 year transition period of ttip . 
  based on projected job displacement in one of the studies of 0.4 -- 1.1 million , our rough ( and conservative ) calculation suggests implied costs of $ 5 -- $ 14 billion for unemployment benefits , excluding costs for re-training and skills-acquisition . 
  in addition , foregone public income from taxes and social contributions from unemployment might accrue to $ 4 -- $ 10 billion . 
  this concern is echoed by dean baker who notes that ... ... there are reasons to believe the growth effect could go in the opposite direction . 
  the model used by the london cepr does not assume any negative growth impact from higher prices for drugs or other goods that might be more costly due to stronger patent and copyright protections coming out of the deal . 
  ( http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/why-is-it-so-acceptable-to-lie-to-promote-trade-deals ) so what should we think ? 
  when the commission claims that ` economic growth and increased productivity ' in ttip will create ` new job opportunities for high - and low-skilled workers alike ' ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/questions-and-answers/ ) it is worth taking it with a large grain of salt . 
  no doubt opportunities will be created for increased transatlantic trade , but what we may need to sacrifice in reaching that goal could be substantial . 
  in any rate , the quest for jobs in europe is unlikely to be answered by ttip . 
  do n't let anyone tell you otherwise . 
  `` we are concerned over the statement beginning ` we would still ... be taking as our starting point the result of the 2010 general election ' . 
  this demonstrates very clearly how the bbc appears to be acting as a worrying brake on democratic change ; i believe they are failing to grasp that the future of politics does n't look like the past . 
  `` in 2010 there was still a widespread belief that an economic recovery would see our economy and society continue much as before . 
  but more people are recognising every day that the business as usual approach to economics , society , environment and politics is now untenable . 
  `` this bbc attitude is contributing dangerously to the buildup of frustration and disillusionment with politics in the uk .
