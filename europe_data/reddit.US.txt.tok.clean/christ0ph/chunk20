  ** exponential growth in technology ** means that a great many entire categories of jobs are just going away , and the nature of that change is very different than it was in the past because its so very rapid now , and becoming more so quickly . 
  in the developed countries , most low skill jobs have already vanished , or are vanishing soon . 
  now its a great many medium and high skill jobs that are vanishing . 
  some ( maybe 10-15 % ) are morphing into even higher skill jobs , quite interesting ones , somewhere . 
  but most are just vanishing . 
  for good . 
  that fact , is a big big part of what 's driving the global push to close the doors and pull up the ladders to economic security . 
  it very much depends on what your parent situation is . 
  whether you have a place you can go to . 
  some people do , some people do n't . 
  do you mean 45k british pounds , euros or dollars ? 
  $ 45k a year is n't enough to live on in california . 
  not unless you live in a shared household and have a support network of friends who you can share meals with and are really frugal . . 
  if you made ** twice ** that you would * probably * ( still ) be able to rent your own place and have a car and save some money . 
  but - rents are going up all the time . 
  california is expensive . 
  its not a good place to start out in if you dont really need to be there . 
  for some kinds of work , its the place to be , but expect to struggle . 
  and if you have to save money to pay off debts or hopefully go back to school to get your phd , you need to make more money than $ 45 k , a lot more . 
  i do n't follow you , could you explain what you mean ? 
  people , ** please [ read this about the secret tisa trade deal ] ( http://www.ei-ie.org/en/news/news_details/2659 ) which is being negotiated in secret , many people feel its a threat to free public education everywhere . 
  ** tisa is the ** [ trade in services agreement ] ( http://www.world-psi.org/sites/default/files/documents/research/report_tisa_eng_lr2.pdf ) ** its probably going to be a direct attack on services like public education and public health care . 
  ttip may be a diversion away from tisa, 
  in the sciences , a phd is entry level to do any kind of research , which is what scientists want and need to do . 
  but , if you get good marks , in most other developed countries , you will get a level of assistance with your education that you would rarely , if ever get in the us . 
  the us system is really failing most americans - kids from poor and middle class families are really struggling now . 
  also , it seems as if there is a campaign to prevent middle class kids from even wanting to go to college and being realistic about the need to stay in school and not just get a four year degree , which is a road map to disaster . 
  i see so many bs stories on here about how people `` got a degree '' ( i.e. 
  any 4 year degree ) but then `` could n't get a job in their major '' . . 
  this is ignoring the fact that people with four year degrees have needed to stay in school and get a better degree for a long time , and that need is especially pressing now , and its been that way for a long time . 
  in the sciences , basically , a phd is entry level . 
  `` significant '' is like saying `` that guy was 20 feet from the shore and i threw him a `` significant amount '' of rope '' ( but he still drowned ), 
  did you get a very high psat , were you a national merit scholar ? 
  but it seems that poor students in the uk have an easier time of somehow paying for college than in the us . 
  if somebody can live at home with their parents for free and go to a degree granting institution near their home , that can save a huge amount of money . 
  the temptation to go away to college for its own sake should be resisted if there is any way to live at home , the chances of being able to afford it are far higher . 
  its a fraction of what it costs to go to most us colleges now . 
  it would even have been cheap 20 years ago . 
  people just have to choose well . 
  and keep in mind the fact that the default is that the cc courses are not eligible for university credit . 
  typically , if somebody is planning to transfer , there are only a few courses among a great many that they can take . 
  the others are worthless for transfer . 
  thats a trap for the unwary . 
  and as i said , a great many community colleges are not eligible for any university credit at all . 
  those are the ones that have very inexpensive tuition now . 
  there is no cheap way to go to college in the us any more if you actually want to get a real college degree . 
  you have to make sure its transferable credit . 
  most cc courses are n't - universities will typically award credit to a subset of community college courses from some community colleges , others can not issue transferable credit . 
  those two years in those schools wont earn any credit at all towards a college degree . 
  a little book of memes ? 
  but a two or four year degree is n't enough any more . 
  most of the job losses we see now are to people with two and four year degrees . 
  people have to stay in school and get a phd or at least an ms ( in fields like engineering ) this is n't new , its been like that for a long time . 
  in most business , the entry level is basically an mba . 
  tisa the secret '' [ trade in services agreement ] ( http://www.world-psi.org/en/psi-special-report-tisa-versus-public-services ) '' now being negotiated in secret between the us and 37 other countries , really pushes privatization of public education , and most other public services , so thats not a good omen . 
  nobody is saying we should stay the same . 
  people who can get a phd or its equivalent in some of the sciences , or even just an ms in some kinds of engineering , have a very bright future . 
  medicine , biosciences . 
  however education costs money . 
  by doing what they are doing they are intentionally creating a world of poor people where only a few will have the skills to simply be employed . 
  mao 's bookstore employer received funding in the 1930s from yale university . 
  ( gwb 's alma mater , best known for its secret `` skull and bones '' society , which john kerry also belonged to ), 
  you bring up a very important point . 
  production is increasing by leaps and bounds , but much of that is due to automation . 
  ** the problem is , suppose those 700,000 jobs had not vanished , instead of going into bankruptcy , those 700,000 workers would have been able to send 1.6 million of their children to college . 
  did you read '' [ putting health first ] ( http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/putting_health_first.pdf ) '' ? 
  you have to understand , the us sees public healthcare systems and programs that save money on drugs by getting governments involved in bargaining down prices , as anathema . 
  also , as far as i can see , these ftas do n't even pay lip service to the idea that any price should be `` affordable '' - in fact they explicitly avoid any kind of moral issue . 
  they basically see money as buying anything . 
  ** if a country can not outbid some other country for its own resources , tough luck . 
  this is interesting :  ** [ assessment of nafta 's impact on us manufacturing jobs ] ( http://www.epi.org/blog/naftas-impact-workers/ ) . . **  '' ** [ nafta 's impact on u.s. workers ] ( http://www.epi.org/blog/naftas-impact-workers/ ) **  * the north american free trade agreement ( natfa ) was the door through which american workers were shoved into the neoliberal global labor market . 
  *  * by establishing the principle that u.s. corporations could relocate production elsewhere and sell back into the united states , nafta undercut the bargaining power of american workers , which had driven the expansion of the middle class since the end of world war ii . 
  the result has been 20 years of stagnant wages and the upward redistribution of income , wealth and political power . 
  *  * nafta affected u.s. workers in four principal ways . 
  first , it caused the loss of some 700,000 jobs as production moved to mexico . 
  most of these losses came in '' ... * see http://www.epi.org/blog/naftas-impact-workers/, 
  not a peep about the think-tank study paid for by the austrian government - that [ estimates that as many as 1,000,000 jobs could be lost ] ( http://guengl.eu/uploads/plenary-focus-pdf/assess_ttip.pdf ) ( ! ), 
  because of ttip ? 
  nafta was responsible for very large numbers of manufacturing lobs being lost in the us . 
  source : http://www.epi.org/blog/naftas-impact-workers/, 
  did you not even read the [ study , commissioned by your austrian government ] ( http://guengl.eu/uploads/plenary-focus-pdf/assess_ttip.pdf ) , that found that it was not unlikely that as many as 1,000,000 jobs * would be lost * because of ttip ? 
  ( on both sides of the atlantic ), 
  thats a very simplistic and one sided view of these ftas that ignores the fact that what 's good for the corporations with all the lobbyists in washington and europe ( and the money to do extensive pr in the media and on blogs ) often is n't what 's best for the country or world as a whole . 
  one example , [ according to epi , nafta resulted in the loss of 682,000 good paying manufacturing jobs ] ( http://www.epi.org/publication/trade-deficit-mexico-resulted-682900-jobs/ ) . 
  another example of when the government allows corporations to have their way with catastrophic results , was the national city lines fiasco that turned the us from the country with the best and most efficient public transit system in the world , to a country that was addicted to fossil fuels , in only 30 years . 
  the privatization and intentional destruction of the country 's public transit network was accomplished by creating a holding company , ** national city lines ** , which under the cover of `` privatization '' bought up hundreds of municipal electric trolley systems - and then quietly destroyed them , initially replacing them with smelly `` modern '' diesel buses . 
  then the bus lines were intentionally cut back and neglected in turn , and in many american cities the bus lines eventually went out of business . 
  ** ( now , several decades later , because the dependence on automobiles and fossil fuels is incredibly wasteful , and millions can not afford cars , many cities are finding that these trolley systems really have to be rebuilt , despite the fact that re-purchasing trolley ( now called `` electric light rail '' ) rights of way is incredibly costly . ), 
  its also not common knowledge but this elimination of public transit was a huge contributing factor to the creation of a persistent underclass in america . 
  nafta cost americans 700,000 manufacturing jobs . 
  in other words , we lost 700,000 manufacturing jobs . 
  they are lying like crazy about that . 
  also , many of the jobs that first went to mexico ended up in asia and still more will if vietnam joins tpp . 
  ( wages are just pennies an hour there ) so mexico and central america are now reeling economically . 
  that 's why there are now a huge number of people trying to flee those countries , or at least get their children , especially young girls , out . 
  there is an [ epidemic of gang violence , hard drugs and rapes since cafta ] ( http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2014/08/central-america-crisis-belies-caftas-empty-promises.html ) because there are practically no jobs . 
  cafta was also devastating to mexican and central american farmers . 
  is it ethical to pit the poor against one another to lower wages ? 
  the rate of improvement in labor-saving technology is exponential . 
  that 's why wages are falling .
