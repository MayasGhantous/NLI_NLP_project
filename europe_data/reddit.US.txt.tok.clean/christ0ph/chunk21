  when you can buy a low power arm cpu for under $ 0.50 that can make more than 3 billion decisions a second , and run nonstop for 30 years without a vacation , or even a restroom break , that changes everything . 
  a race to the bottom . 
  you have to understand that here in the us , the auto industry never recovered from nafta , and so they are probably desperate . 
  more than 700,000 jobs were lost . 
  americans have huge healthcare bills , which dont go away even if we spend hundreds or in many cases thousands of dollars a month on `` health insurance '' . 
  americans still get hit with huge out of network healthcare bills which often bankrupt a family overnight . 
  canadian-quality healthcare would easily cost a us family $ 100,000 a year in the us , if it was even available . 
  for an example , read this story in the new york times from the other day about [ `` drive by doctoring '' ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/us/drive-by-doctoring-surprise-medical-bills.html ) . 
  tisa plans to globalize service industries . 
  the corporations that are winners of the new procurement contracts will be able to bring their own staff in . 
  although the rules on `` indirect expropriation '' and isds seem to prohibit increases in minimum wages after an fta is signed , there is no prohibition against lowering them , so its possible that lowered minimum wages and benefits may become common , as suuply increases and demand is falling due to huge improvements in labor saving technology . 
  for example , one us political candidate who looks like he might get a lot of support from a right wing think tank , has proposed `` eliminating weekends '' ( voluntarily ) . 
  i would n't let them in !, 
  would you ? 
  healthcare is a huge profit center . 
  there are hundreds of thousands , perhaps soon millions of euros which could be extracted from each european using the modern `` inelastic market '' technique pioneered in the us .

  okay , thanks !, 
  you 're right , i stand corrected . 
  they have to spray to keep it down ... malaria has been eradicated in 1974 but then it came back , when they stopped spraying, 
  but the ccpa paper is quite well researched , as are all of their publications . 
  also , i do n't think lanks 's assertion that ccpa is funded by labor unions is accurate either . 
  id never heard that before . 
  they seem to have a general appeal to progressive canadians and they do have the usual membership and fundraising activities . 
  ccpa publications are a very reliable - perhaps one of the better ones that i know of , source of info on at least a dozen ftas - every fta that involves canada , which is a great many - also on general trade-related topics - here is how to find them . 
  use the google search operator site : policyalternatives.ca < string  ( try combining fta names with other terms , or with file type selector filetype : pdf - - then google will return just their larger pdf reports - use just fta names ( examples - nafta ttip ceta gats , etc ) - they have a lot of material on gats . 
  gats and nafta are particularly useful because they both seem to have been prototype documents which concepts are borrowed from extensively you can and search terms together with a plus sign -, 
  calling these monstrosities `` free trade '' is like calling the equally coercive aca in the us `` health care reform '' - it kind of catches in your throat , because there is nothing free about it , they are coercive . 
  people should know about tisa , the trade in services agreement - this will effect everybody . 
  for example , this is where the all important services problems are , in all probability , much more so than ttip .

  ouch . . thank you for letting me know , you 're right . 
  i do n't know why i read it the way i did . 
  i 'm still glad i posted the stories i posted but you 're right i read it wrong . 
  are you swiss ? 
  i 'm curious about several things in the article . 
  it appears that the swiss get a better deal than even poor americans . 
  what about mosquito spraying ? 
  no spraying = malaria, 
  this study says 1m jobs would be lost `` on both sides of the atlantic '' however , those who retained their jobs might see an average income increase of several hundred euros by the next decade . 
  ( which could mean most incomes would fall while some might see large increases ) no estimate of the amounts lost due to privatization of social benefits but in the us ( compared to an identical canadian ) its probably in mid six figures over a lifetime . 
  ( healthcare cost comparison ) http://guengl.eu/uploads/plenary-focus-pdf/assess_ttip.pdf, 
  i 'm scared the world wont survive this century . 
  the swiss , or anybody else for that matter - should think long and hard before they allow privatization or new trade agreements that dont have explicit carve outs for everything that could remotely be related to health care services . . ( tisa !, 
  - isnt it - tisa - being negotiated in switzerland ? ), 
  i would absolutely not even want my worst enemy to be forced to move any closer to what we have here in the us , which is a major disaster for everybody except the politico-lobbying complex . 
  for example , check out these stories - just the last few days . 
  and i wasnt looking for them . 
  -- this is a story that shows how there is no longer any attempt to prevent or have accountability for these huge extra costs which are not covered by insurance . 
  often people are literally unconscious so there is nothing that they can say or do to prevent these huge sudden extra bills . . [ after surgery , surprise $ 117,000 medical bill from doctor he did n't know - nytimes.com ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/us/drive-by-doctoring-surprise-medical-bills.html ) ------- another horror story [ modern healthcare : underinsured aca enrollees strain community health centers ] ( http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140925/news/309259947/underinsured-aca-enrollees-strain-community-health-centers ) obamacare enrollees are straining the finances of community health centers around the country , some health center leaders say . 
  the issue is that many lower-income patients with insurance coverage through the federal and state exchanges bought bronze-tier plans with lower premiums but high deductibles , coinsurance and copayments and no federal cost-sharing subsidies . 
  when these patients face high out-of-pocket costs for care that falls below the deductible , they ca n't afford it . 
  so the centers are subsidizing that care by offering them means-tested sliding-scale fees . 
  when the centers , which are not allowed to turn away patients for inability to pay , try to get the insurers to pay , the claims are usually denied , and the centers have to write it off as uncompensated care ( dickson , 9/25 ) .

  [ kaiser health news : debate grows over employer plans with no hospital benefits ] ( http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2014/september/26/employee-insurance-hospitalization-coverage.aspx ) as companies prepare to offer medical coverage for 2015 , debate has grown over government software that critics say can trap workers in inadequate plans while barring them from subsidies to buy fuller coverage on their own . 
  at the center of contention is the calculator -- an online spreadsheet to certify whether plans meet the affordable care act 's toughest standard for large employers , the ` minimum value ' test for adequate benefits ( hancock , 9/26 ) .

  deregulation is what caused most of the problems so its definitely not the solution , however , regulation by corrupt officials is not the solution either because it is a form of looting . 
  the solution is perhas eventually more direct forms of government . 
  we all need to learn much more about technology because otherwise technology makes it really easy to steal and conceal your thefts . 
  thank you , you nailed it right on the head . 
  have you ever heard of william black 's term `` control fraud '' ? 
  jobs are going away everywhere due to automation . 
  so , we should try to figure out how to raise the educational level of society so we can move on to the next phase of humanity 's evolution which hopefully will include all of our survival as a species , our cleaning up the planet , and going out into space . 
  the competing vision would have us all at one anothers throats and distracted from the fact that we should all have lots more time and the resources to devote to learning because human life is too short to learn all the things we should want and need to learn . 
  a race to the bottom is bad and a horrible quality of life for everybody , including the rich . 
  it leads to genocide and wwiii, 
  the insider political class are increasingly corrupt , and have all sorts of conflicts of interests which they hide . . 
  they signal left but then they turn right . 
  here is an example , the us 's obama who basically shamelessly lied to get into office on the democratic ticket . . ( thanks to hundreds of thousands of gop crossover voters who voted democratic in the 2008 primaries to ensure that obama would be the democratic nominee ) of course as many can see , obama actually is a neoliberal and europeans would correctly identify him as coming from the center right - but , americans dont have that perspective . 
  most of us know nothing about ttip , tisa , tpp , etc , and are trying to understand why he keeps saying things that leftists say ( such a skilled actor ) but doing the things the right would do ( often in secret trade negotiations ) what i am saying is that politicians are breaking the rules that used to hold and the only weapon against this is lifting up these rocks and getting some light in there . 
  nothing else will fix the mess we have now . 
  one thing that distresses me a lot is the failure of the greek government to continue vector control measures that had been almost successful in eliminating malaria . 
  now malaria is back with a vengeance - malaria imposes a huge cost on society . 
  as do all really horrible , incurable chronic diseases of poverty . 
  the assertions that the various ftas here in the us would create large numbers of jobs ( here ) or improve the economy are unsupported by the facts . 
  in fact the opposite seems to be true . 
  eyes on trade [ has examined us trade with non-fta nations compared to fta nations ] ( http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2014/03/us-trade-deficits-have-grown-more-than-440-with-fta-countries-but-declined-16-with-non-fta-countries.html ) and non-fta trade appears to be doing better than trade with fta nations !, 
  however that does n't stop the proponents of more ftas from repeating them over and over again . 
   - free trade agreements have created more wealth than any protectionist measure ever could . 
  i hope you do n't mind my asking for a source . 
  i hope you feel better , take a nap , thats always good for one 's overall energy and creativity level . 
  what about `` provisional application '' ive read that applies to ceta . 
  wouldnt that mean its active righ away ? 
  also ive read that they plan to continue changing things for another two years . 
  glyn moody wrote a column about this in the spring . 
  i 'm pretty sure that like many ftas , it is provisionally approved once this preliminary version is presented - then they can work for another one or two years in private changing all sorts of things even as its already in effect . 
  dont make the assumption it is not in effect right away , most of them are now because it takes years to get them ratified , sometimes they never are . 
  to give you an example , in the yukos case , a huge 50 billion euros fine was recently awarded to a bunch of expat russian oligarchs against russia for breaking a * 90s era * energy treaty which had never been ratified . 
  90s era meaning immediately after the collapse of the former soviet union . 
  the winners were new russians ( oligarch/gangsters ) who were among the first to snap up state assets at bargain basement prices . . ( corruption ) the fta courts seem to often rubber stamp really corrupt , unfair deals . 
  no matter what you feel about russia , it should be obvious that any deals which occurred right after the collapse of the former soviet union were corrupt . 
  what about provisional application ? 
  give me one fact that the report contains that you claim is wrong -, 
  the agenda is hidden for a reason , and that reason is thats it is quite unpopular when its unmasked for what it is . 
  so its likely to fail if people simply expose it and dont take the attitude that its unstoppable . 
  for example , americans are being lept in the dark that these three ftas even exist . 
  thats because we would be strongly opposed to them if we knew what was in them .
