  if you look at savannajeff 's posts he almost never documents his assertions with facts or links , he just claims he does . 
  constant noise lowers a child 's lifetime iq by 10 points . 
  example of how the ftas are all being hidden from sight in the usa : http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ of course , its not just not true , single payer healthcare will never be right around the corner under ftas , its a shameless lie , because the ftas make it impossible . 
  by intent . 
  however , these lies are the reason that we americans do n't even know that the 3 ftas even exist , let alone what they try to do or how . 
  ( isds , indirect expropriation , standstill , ratchet , rollback , and especially the fact that they are irreversible by future elections . ), 
  we americans do n't know that they override future policy freedom at all - in fact , with good reason , when they are explained to us , most americans get angry and insist ( with good reason , i think ) that its unconstitutional . 
  we just do n't grasp that obama is actually pushing one agenda in the news media and at the same time , working to forever block and undermine good government and policy in these three permanent , irreversible ftas . 
  that 's being done quite dishonestly . 
  the only way they get away with it is by lying . 
  did you see the `` stepping stone to single payer '' url above ? 
  ( or google that phrase ) a shameless example of how these ftas are being hid in the usa . 
  you should visit their site , ( http://policyalternatives.ca ) they are a large ngo which does all sorts of great stuff for everyday canadians . 
  not what you say at all . 
  ** i think that some very minor unimportant sounding approval of preliminary text may activate ceta in a provisional application mode , which may be as onerous , or even more onerous than once its actually ratified !, 
  ** there is a very big desire to pass these things even by subterfuge . 
  they have been very dishonest from day 1 . 
  the same thing goes for ttip+tisa ( tisa is where the services stuff will be , because of all the developing countries in the tisa club , which will lead to a lot of services privatization at very low wages/benefits in developed countries , not ttip ) and tpp . 
  first attempt to push isds globally was in the mai , which caused a global scandal . 
  then they tried to expand the scope of wto gats , which failed , then here in the americas - ftaa , which was a laundry list of the same bad ideas , which failed ... 
  there is a lot of history to these things . 
  they keep trying to roll out the same laundry list of bad ideas , failing and then trying again a few years later - but never learning the lesson that isds is failing to be seen as acceptable for a good reason , its a threat to democracy . . 
  here is a video of [ scott sinclair from ccpa speaking ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9or5ecpe0de ) last year . 
  why do n't you folks judge for yourselves , rather than taking somebody else 's opinion as fact . 
  ccpa is one of the best sources for information on a great many ftas . 
  and their pubs are free , even though some of them are of book quality . 
  please do n't blame we americans !, 
  we 're being lied to too !, 
  europeans should be aware that the obama administration got elected by hiding this neoliberal agenda and almost no americans know about that neoliberal agenda or the three pending us ftas at all !, 
  ( especially ttip and the ultra-secret tisa , a very few , a bit more , know about tpp ) in fact , very few americans even know the slightest bit about neoliberalism . 
  we were sold the bill of goods that obama was a `` liberal '' which in the us mean left of center , and americans are still really in a state of shock that he consistently signals left and turns right , and most of us are just trying to figure it out . 
  please understand that we americans are intentionally kept completely ignorant of trade policy 's very existence , by a media that fails to report on anything related to ftas , at all . 
  with a media that blots out all news of ftas , many americans tend to disbelieve the occasional plea for attention to this issue or information presented to us on its significance . 
  so , out of the 350 million of us , perhaps a few thousand , at best , know the fact that the ftas hijack huge , important policy areas , or that they are working feverishly to superimpose an extreme ideology which nobody would agree with , over all of our laws , using trade policy , for good . 
  anybody who attempts to explain it is attacked by the right . 
  obama 's main allies on trade are on the right , but many leading dems are also covert neolibs . 
  corporate money has been controlling us politicians more and more each year . 
  we desperately need campaign finance reform . 
  no doubt , thats why they are trying to use ftas to render any future electoral reform completely ineffectual to legislate by means of their `` regulatory capture '' - # 1 means of doing that is these invisibly created `` rights '' - created by means of isds . 
  to use a european analogy , ceta is a bit like the spanish civil war and canada is guernica . 
  isds and similar , and perhaps also a provisional application subterfuge , which lets them leak a sanitized version and then approve a much more aggressive version in secret , might well be testing ground for a corporatism which should be recognized as a threat to the civilized world . 
  the same problem exists with ttip and the secret tisa ( which according to experts , is quite likely to be where the all important services stuff really is , not ttip ! ), 
  i could give countless examples of other really shameless deceptions to hide the ftas and their implications . 
  so , do n't blame us - meaning , we , the american people ( i 'm american ) we 're being lied to by our * politico-industrial complex * too . 
  its clearly a scheme by a tiny but very powerful group to quash the ability of our democracies to govern , both here and in the eu . 
  its being crammed through without public knowledge of its implications , even as - here in the us a disinformation campaign is raging to hide the fact that they quash our ability to set healthcare policy . 
  how do they hide that ? 
  [ see this link ! ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) . 
  ( * the 3 t-ftas block any new public healthcare , explicitly , by means of their standstill , ratchet and isds corporate entitlements , * so why is democratic senator harry reid promising that obamacare is a `` stepping stone to single payer '' ? 
  * ( google that phrase - to see how the aca has been marketed by shameless lying ! ), 
  and as you will notice , these ftas try to use `` investor-state dispute settlement '' ( or `` isds '' ) , `` indirect expropriation '' , `` standstill '' , `` ratchet '' , `` rollback '' and sneaky trojan horse clauses to make democracy impotent to change anything that adversely impacts a corporate investor 's profits , which basically makes it so governments can not do their jobs . 
  they are hiding that !, 
  the canadian ngo policy alternatives have ( in my opinion ) some of the very best writing on free trade agreements going back at least the last ten years . 
  if people want to learn about ftas - i cant think of a better place than their web site . 
  you can find the reports by using the google `` site : policyalternatives.ca '' operator along with the fta name , for example , gats , nafta , or ftaa will all return stuff , as will ceta . 
  check it out !, 
  i would also look at scott sinclair 's author page . 
  whether isds is in ttip or not , people should remember , [ tisa is being negotiated in secret ] ( http://www.bilaterals.org/?psi-special-report-the-really-good ) and that has the potential to be the one with the biggest impact on society [ because its the service jobs agreement ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) . 
  service jobs are more than 60 % of all jobs . 
  kind of like gats ii . 
  ( gats is the wto fta that for decades has been mandating one way services privatizations in the nations that have signed , like the us , canada , uk , etc. 
  and many others . ), 
  i am not at all sure about what is required by the so called `` provisional application '' do parts of it take effect immediately , even before its ratified ? 
  el salvador had no contract with this company at all . 
  article in the new york times showing just how incredibly out of control the us healthcare system has become . 
  must read . 
  have you seen the various arguments in the case documents ? 
  you can read them all on http://italaw.com, 
  seems like the corporations are winning these investor-state battles a lot . 
  even when the treaties remain unratified , like the 50 billion euro award with the yukos case a few months ago, 
  i suppose the countries can forgo trade with the us and eu ... 
  will the human race survive this century ? 
  i have made a few posts theorizing this would be the way they would do it , it appears that i was right . 
   * `` they can only get sued if there is no reasonable grounds for putting the new environmental standards in place . 
  '' * not true . . countries are sued all the time for violating some amorphous right to let other countries exploit their natural resources . 
  el salvador , one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere , [ was sued for $ 300 million by pacific rim mining company ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_rim_mining_corporation ) for '' [ changing the rules of the game ] ( http://www.italaw.com/search/site/el%2520salvador ) '' the company apparently had no presence in the country , there was no contract that was broken , btw . 
  they may need to buy or set up a subsidiary in a country with an fta with their country , or move their address of record to some other country with which their own country has an fta . 
  and then their country has to change some law or other condition ( or change some policy ) that adversely impacts their profits . 
  it can be very vague . 
  a mining company is suing [ el salvador ] ( http://www.italaw.com/search/site/el%2520salvador ) over some vague right to mine even though it seems to me that it would be likely to foul the nations water supply . 
  slovakia [ was sued over single payer and limiting health insurers profits ] ( http://www.italaw.com/search/site/achmea%2520slovak ) in the interim . . 
  what about provisional application there are some real gotchas in these investment treaties - even unratified , they may still be binding while they wind through the ratification process which can take years . 
  even if they are never ratified they may still be binding . 
  there is something called provisional application which i linked to some info on lower down . 
  i am pretty sure that countries can only very very rarely be sued for regulating . 
  it almost never happens . 
  although some countries now almost never regulate .

  they are free to do anything that does n't adversely impact any investor . 
  also , they could pretend to be in gridlock , arguing with one another so much that nothing can be done . 
  when the world found out about the mai in the 90s - as i understand it , there was a huge public outcry . 
  then did n't france back out - and because of the way the eu was set up , that nixed mai ? 
  skillful manipulators always try to `` divide and conquer '' by exploiting historical rivalries , etc.

  no , they are apparently on their way to being a traded commodity .

  my mother taught me the difference between right and wrong . 
  this is what i meant : http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/international-migration/glossary/provisional-application/ ** provisional application ** the growing use of provisional application clauses in treaties is a consequence of the need felt to give effect to treaty obligations prior to a state 's formal ratification of / accession to a treaty . 
  the obligations relating to provisional application are undertaken by a conscious voluntary act of the state consistent with its domestic legal framework . 
  ** provisional application of a treaty that has entered into force ** the provisional application of a treaty that has entered into force may occur when a state undertakes to give effect to the treaty obligations provisionally although its domestic procedures for ratification / accession have not yet been completed .
