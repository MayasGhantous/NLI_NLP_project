  the intention of the state would be to ratify / accede to the treaty once its domestic legal requirements have been met . 
  provisional application may be terminated at any time . 
  in contrast , a state which has consented to be bound by a treaty through ratification / accession or definitive signature , is governed by the rules on withdrawal specified in the treaty concerned ( arts .

  ** provisional application of a treaty that has not entered into force ** provisional application of a treaty that has not entered into force may occur when a state notifies that it would give effect to the legal obligations specified in that treaty provisionally . 
  these legal obligations are undertaken by a conscious voluntary act of the state consistent with its domestic legal framework . 
  provisional application may be terminated at any time . 
  in contrast , a state which has consented to be bound by a treaty through ratification / accession or definitive signature , is governed by the rules on withdrawal specified in the treaty concerned ( arts . 
  54 , 56 , vienna convention on the law of treaties 1969 ) . 
  provisional application may continue even after the entry into force of the treaty in relation to a state applying the treaty provisionally until that state has ratified it . 
  provisional application terminates if a state notifies the other states among which the treaty is being applied provisionally of its intention of not becoming a party to the treaty . 
  [ art . 
  25 ( 2 ) , vienna convention on the law of treaties 1969 ] ** provisional entry into force ** there are also an increasing number of treaties which include provisions for provisional entry into force . 
  such treaties provide mechanisms for entry into force provisionally , should the formal criteria for entry into force not be met within a given period . 
  provisional entry into force of a treaty may also occur when a number of parties to a treaty which has not yet entered into force , decide to apply the treaty as if it had entered into force . 
  once a treaty has entered into force provisionally , it is binding on the parties which agreed to bring it into force provisionally . 
  * the nature of the legal obligations resulting from provisional entry into force would appear to be the same as the legal obligations in a treaty that has entered into force , as any other result would create an uncertain legal situation . 
  it is the criteria for formal entry into force that have not been met but the legal standard of the obligations remains .

  now , one corrupt administration can bind a country 's future to their extreme corporate agenda , with no date that it ends , they claim the fta 's bind a country to the investor 's special interests , `` forever '' look at what happened in [ achmea v. slovak republic ii ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) . 
  an insurance company blocked a country from having affordable health care and their logic was ( which won , what they lost was only that they sued too early ) was `` this country 's market '' is our property . 
  a canadian ngo , policy alternatives has lots of really good publications explaining many fta issues . 
  this is an example of an essay on the 2005 ftaa fta ( obama 's trade policy is just as broken or even arguably - more broken than bush 's ) http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/2005/divide_and_conquer.pdf, 
  the issues which these courts decide can only be whether they are violating that agreement , which the countries almost always are . 
  all moral , legal , safety or other issues are not in their jurisdiction and wont be considered . 
  jeff , there is a greater issue here , you know . 
  okay , i 'm sorry , i thought that you were for some reason . 
  as i said earlier , neither i nor my friends , nor anybody else who knows me , has ever suggested anything other than that i 'm smart , make a lot of connections that elude other people , and am a bit blunt sometimes but in a way which neither they nor i would want to lose . 
  i can live with that . 
  i hold no ill against you . 
  and in fact i 'm trying to be helpful . 
  you 're trying to pretend you know the answer but someday , not far in the future you 'll be glad you had this conversation . 
  which reminds me , i 'm asking you again , would you be able to give me some examples of arguments for neo-liberalism that you respect ? 
  ive asked you a number of times . 
  ive noticed a pattern where you only reply to posts of mine that do n't make any kind of point . 
  maybe if they were n't under so much pressure by the privatizers they would not be so paranoid eh , jeff ? 
  no , i did n't mean ethyl alcohol, 
  i do n't implicitly trust national or state health departments - would you ? 
  do you understand that endocrine disruptors are often active at very low levels and/or at a particular stage of development even when the same chemical does not have that effect , or any effect , at a higher level ? 
  it may have a different effect or no measurable effect at all . 
  also , many chemicals as i said , are cumulative . 
  people can be exposed to them for a long time and then suddenly , the body says `` no more '' and everything falls apart . 
  that 's actually a lot more common than almost anybody realizes . 
  sensitizers can do that . 
  the only people who understand this seem to be toxicologists and immunologists . 
  ( its called priming ) also , and this is extremely important . 
  jobs are increasingly technical . 
  that means that a very low level of some toxicant can and often does render people completely unable to work in the workplace of the 21st century . 
  the ability to do certain kinds of thinking will make or break a person 's life . 
  we see it when doctors or lawyers get certain kinds of exposures . 
  suddenly , they can not do the work they used to do . 
  clearly , something happened . 
  that happens a lot . 
  your `` potentially toxic chemicals should be innocent until proven guilty '' approach is worse than inappropriate when the stakes are so high and the difficulty of tracing causes years of decades later so high . 
  its criminal . 
  when a government puts things in a secret fta that they could not ever get by means of the ballot box , that effect millions of peoples well being and health , and then lies about it , pathologically , i have a problem with that . 
  use pubmed , not wikipedia . 
  based on our experience with [ tetraethyl lead ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=tetraethyl+lead ) ... 
  manganese exposure is ** cumulative ** ( over ones lifetime ) and chronic exposure has for a very long time been [ known to be neurotoxic ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3886254/ ), 
  people should be aware that almost no mainstream us media ever mentions any of these ftas , or any of these isds suits , so much more than 99 % of all americans have not even the most remote idea this is going on . 
  nor do we profit from it . 
  the people who are pushing it are doing it in secret . 
  do you mean their global takeover of society - corporate sovereignty ? 
  this is [ a little chunk of a critique ] ( https://people.vrijschrift.org/~ante/ttip/vrijschrift-shortcomings-nl-study-isds.html ) of a recent dutch government study that concluded isds is great - these are shortcomings shared by many biased examinations of these issues i think . 
  -- cut here --------- this note concludes that the tietje , baetens and ecorys study fails to notice essential shortcomings of investor-to-state arbitration . 
  modern democratic societies separate powers : legislature , government , and courts . 
  investor-to-state arbitration on the other hand concentrates power . 
  the isds system gives arbitrators the power to review all decisions by legislatures , governments , and courts , but does not observe the separation of powers , lacks basic institutional safeguards of judicial independence , creates perverse incentives , and gives the us an unfair advantage . 
  specifically , the study does not mention serious issues with the fair and equitable ( fet ) standard , presents a stabilisation clause ( changes to laws are only allowed if compensation is paid ) as uncontroversial , presents an aspirational definition of indirect expropriation , which is industry friendly , not democracy friendly , as the accepted definition under international law , does not mention that in investment treaties investor rights trump human rights , does not mention serious sovereign debt issues , does not mention that isds lacks conventional institutional safeguards for independence : tenure , prohibitions on outside remuneration by the arbitrator and neutral appointment of arbitrators , does not mention that a for-profit asynchronous arbitration mechanism -- arbitrators are paid for their task at least 3000 us dollar a day -- creates perverse incentives : accepting frivolous cases , letting cases drag on , letting the only party that can initiate cases ( foreign investors ) win to stimulate more cases , pleasing the officials who can appoint arbitrators , discusses the icsid appeal procedure , without mentioning that the president of the world bank ( in practice appointed by the us ) appoints all three the arbitrators in appeal cases under icsid rules , which gives the us an unfair advantage , does not mention a study that finds that claimants from the us were 91 % more likely to benefit from an expansive resolution than claimants from all other states combined , mentions the loewen case without mentioning that the us pressured an isds arbitrator , does not mention that a system that gives the us an unfair advantage is a serious threat to the eu 's privacy protection , does not mention that we can not expect eu investors to win major cases against the us , does not mention that it is near impossible to withdraw from trade agreements , as a consequence flaws in the isds procedure in a trade agreement will be as good as impossible to solve , concludes that the risks of isds are overstated -- a conclusion which is based on flawed statistics . 
  they settled out of court for some huge sum i am pretty sure . 
  like many of these cases , the amount is secret . 
  why do they always need to get their way ? 
  isnt every investment priced based on perceived risk ? 
  citizens of countries all get the risk dumped on them now , and then have to pay off the companies gambling debts as well ? 
  so , neolibs divide and conquer , then ? 
  look at whats going on with canada and ceta right now before you say that , its quite eye opening . 
  well , in this case germany has some experience with the end result of this kind of thing which perhaps gives it some insight as to what our planet most urgently needs to avoid that other countries , like the us , lack . 
  that argument should be used . 
  please call this thing what it is , a global putsch . 
  because if you knew what they try to do and how they frame things , their backwards way of seeing things which is against the public interest and elevates corporations above countries , you would be very angry and oppose them . 
  for example , [ tisa , the next one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) , will attempt to [ privatize public services ] ( http://www.world-psi.org/en/psi-special-report-tisa-versus-public-services ) at great cost to society ( they can not be traded like chips if they are staffed by professional public servants - also that efficient and saves money ) even more than gats has . 
  at this pint i think we should realize they are always going to ** signal left and turn right ** , so to speak . 
  thats how compulsive liars work . 
   do you trust the people making the decisions or not . 
  no , the reason is , they have shown by their consistent willingness to make really gross misrepresentations , ( the 5 us media corpos basically are hiding the ftas very existence in the us ) the only people who seem to understand them are people who have had the misfortune to have had to deal with extreme compulsive liars , a style of politics which i suspect is more common in the us than in the eu . 
  but not for long because the effect of isds is to put a chill over any and all actions by government which might adversely effect some corporation requiring compensation by means of an indirect expropriation argument . . 
  this has the effect of making it so all the governments can do are things that benefit all multinational corporations and oftentimes that means they adversely effect the people . 
  the other option legislators have is to be in gridlock all the time and not do anything then either . 
  these deals are ** criminogenic ** in that they encourage politicians to become compulsive liars who then must keep continuing to liem must lie to cover up the big lie - [ promising changes they can not ever deliver - because of the ftas ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) , in order to manipulate the public - and get into and stay in office . 
  the people who are pushing these demonic pacts have nothing but contempt for us , the people of all of our countries . 
  listen [ to your australian doctors ] ( http://www.bilaterals.org/?ama-warns-on-risks-lurking-in-tpp ) , jeff . 
  ** people should investigate concepts like `` indirect expropriation '' too . 
  ** the audacity with which this power grab has been hidden from society is really striking . 
  for example , in the us the media has completely blocked out news about the 3 secret ftas and obamacare ( one way privatization ) has been hyped as being a `` stepping stone to single payer '' ( google that phrase ) here is an example of what i mean - this is a really shameless lie !, 
  ** [ reid says obamacare just a step toward eventual single-payer system - las vegas sun news ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) ** here is a 2009 paper that explains how the existing wto services fta , gats bars any kind of new public service - all ftas are designed explicitly to block new public services , and dismember existing ones . . especially single payer .
