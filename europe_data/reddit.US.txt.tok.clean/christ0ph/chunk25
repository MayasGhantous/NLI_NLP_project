  also , there is a significant chance that the drought in the us southwest may turn into a 100 year drought , as seems to happen every few hundred years . . http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2014/09/02/california-megadrought/14446195/ if thats the case , we 'll need cheap energy to protect agriculture in california and the southwest - and provide drinking water , also fracking , which they want to increase , could foul precious water supplies with endocrine disruptors . . especially if the water table drops , concentration of contaminants would rise . 
  at the page below , there 's another discussion of the pros and cons of the ttip energy deal , and i think the cons are more compelling - please read it . 
  http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2014/06/30/bipartisan-push-for-lng-export/ a jump in energy costs is something that could easily have major adverse effects on both employment ( and housing affordability ) in the usa . 
  food costs could also go up , a lot . 
  but the housing issue is not on their radar screen . 
  huge numbers of apartments were built here in the us in the immediate postwar era , by a form of public/private corporation that as far as i can tell is now barred by ftas . 
  so they cant be replaced . 
  if the cost to heat them jumps up , the owners ( they are all privately owned now ) may suddenly have a constitutionally protected legal loophole which will let them go out of business and tear those buildings down , replacing them with condos which in many cities would cost  $ 500,000 per unit , or more , a cost which almost none of the working people currently living there could suddenly afford . 
  nor could they afford to move . 
  most of them do n't even own cars or drive and public transportation here is not good , its nothing like what european cities have . 
  the us used to have the best public transportation in the world , but the national city lines privatization fiasco ended that . 
  a better approach to making business more stable would be a global shared initiative to wean the entire planet from fossil fuels and nuclear fission . 
  ( because of the solar storm risk ) that would be much wiser than suddenly subjecting us here in the us to sudden , rapid jumps in the cost of energy . 
  which would lead to a huge number of americans really being heavily impacted , losing their jobs and in many cases , homes , just so the already wealthy energy industry can make a killing selling lng to asia . 
  you are n't really making any sense to me , i 'm sorry . 
  are you trying to imply that only corporations matter now ? 
  what should determine wages ? 
  the changes can increase corporate profits , so if a country eliminated regulations , that would be okay unless those regulations protected the corporation from some loss of profit . 
  is n't it being hyped as the biggest trade deal ever ? 
  at least until tisa comes out which is services , like peoples jobs , health insurance , and all sorts of important stuff like that . . tisa is supposed to be even bigger . . around 60 % of all jobs are service jobs . 
  `` everything you ca n't drop on your foot '' . 
  the effect of `` indirect expropriation '' , ` standstill '' `` rollback '' etc. 
  clauses it seems to me is basically the same . 
  could ttip or other fta 's controversial `` indirect expropriation '' and `` isds '' provisions for `` investors '' be interpreted as blocking new laws legislating any increase in wages paid to employees in member countries ? 
  * the protection of an alien corporation 's property in a host country against `` direct expropriation '' has long existed in the international arena . 
  direct expropriations include nationalizations , physical seizures of assets or legislated transfers of assets to the state . 
  however such physical takings are no longer common practice . 
  nowadays , expropriation is mainly in the form of `` indirect expropriation '' : * *** acts and steps taken by governments which interfere with the right to the property or diminish the value of the property '' *** it seems as if the ftas give corporations ownership of a country under a fixed set of conditions . 
  cases were filed in private fta courts against egypt and kyrgyz republic which alleged that the investor-state provisions in ftas there barred legislation to increase wages . 
  its even worse in the us . 
  * we americans - thanks to 5 huge corporations controlling almost all of the us mainstream media , have not even been told that [ this huge cozy insider corporate deal ] ( http://ttip2014.eu ) exists !, 
  * ttip - which hopes to basically override all sorts of us and eu laws , including important policies and us state laws which protect many from toxic policy and [ chemicals ] ( http://www.ciel.org/publications/toxicpartnership_mar2014.pdf ) and potentially harmful foods , is completely absent from the us mass media . 
  okay !, 
  thank you . 
  you 're right . 
  do n't you want to know ? 
  i would . 
  next time you hear people bitching about the cost of running the nhs , you can tell them that the average american has to spend a quarter to half million dollars more than a brit over their lifetimes ( conservative estimate ) and for that we get what for all but the wealthiest of us is is increasingly abbreviated healthcare and generic drugs . 
  can you distinguish between good and evil ? 
  now there is where you do n't understand the problem . 
  ** single ** payer is a package of changes that allows ** high quality ** health care to be delivered for much less than what the us is spending . 
  single payer means single payer . 
  ** there [ is no such thing as a public option that would save money ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwbzz070m-k ) or do anything other than fail given the dozen or so other constraints wich have been put into place ( to pick the most obvious one , the promise from ftas and again , from their enablers in us government that under every and all conditions insurance companies would be preserved and not only that , continue to be immensely profitable !, 
  what you are proposing was made up by us insurance companies as part of their really quite devious strategy and it 's literally designed to fail . 
  its pointless . 
  it ca n't save money , or deliver high quality anything . 
  it is a trap that they knew was not ever going to be implemented , * it was just the bait in a bait and switch scheme . 
  * but , suppose it was implemented . 
  ( it actually could not work ) but suppose it could actually be implemented and somehow did save money , would not the prohibitions against public services kick in ? 
  also , suppose somehow it could overcome them , * it would be prohibited by ftas `` indirect expropriation '' prohibitions , from being a better deal !, 
  * because that is unfair to corporations , and prohibited by gats . 
  also , is n't there a prohibition on numbber of service suppliers that would apply if any barrier to new companies entry , like a supposed government monopoly was involved . 
  the insurance company / government coalition , the hundreds of lobbyists . . the drug companies , were 20 years ahead of the situation and they have been working tirelessly to close off all of the real money saving options for americans and others with these ftas , . . with no exceptions . 
  the math does n't work for the fake `` public option '' . 
  so many things were misrepresented - its really quite ugly [ see this web page ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/resources/pnhp-research-the-case-for-a-national-health-program ) . 
  single payer does n't work if its modified to not be single payer . 
  but , of course , thats the plan . 
  the specifics are probably on http://antiguawto.com, 
  i have to say , it strikes me as a bit strange , or something a bit stronger , that you 're trying so hard to dismiss the core points which i am trying to make . 
  i mean , you have a strange set of priorities . 
  lets not and say we did . 
  lets just dump the whole thing . 
  read the frigging pdf . 
  its secret for a reason . 
  did you see the financial chapter on wikileaks ? 
  how would you have done it ? 
  good, 
  what was it that clint eastwood said in dirty harry - do we feel lucky ? 
  if your claim is that these issues are of anything other than huge significance then you 're not reading the literature in the subject because the consensus in all the objective literature is that the gats and that the lack of a broad and explicit horizontal public services carve out - which needs to be explicit , is a huge global concern . 
  read gats article 21 and you 'll see that leaving gats is not even remotely easy , especially if a market segment which has a high profit associated with it is involved . 
  online gambling is so small as to have been under the radar , but health insurance is so huge that they would be compelled to make an example out of us . 
  talk about chilling effects !, 
  there is a cluster of fta penalties which are very functionally related . 
  the net intention and the net effect is clearly investor-state even if the way its implemented is lightly different between ftas . 
  clearly , the us is at tremendous risk that a foreign health insurance provider might enter the us market - all they want is to sell one policy in the whole country . 
  the minute the us does that , they will come in and we will be trapped . 
  in that case they gave antigua the right to commercially pirate some arbitrary value of us ip . 
  any idea how that worked out ? 
  it seems as if it would be hard to ascertain a great many things about that situation . 
  [ see the discussion beginning on page 8 here ] ( http://www.maine.gov/legis/opla/ctpchlthcaresub.pdf ) currently , no foreign health insurance providers ( as far as i know ) operate in any us state us yet . 
  but , they have an active request to create a single national naic model rule , with the wto . 
  see www.citizen.org/documents/usa.pdf also , the obama administration is aggressively courting foreign financial services firms , such as health insurers - trying to facilitate their entry into the us market . 
  if a foreign insurance provider either establishes a subsidiary in the us , or buys a us company , or more ominously , if an existing us insurer simply moves to establish themselves as residing in a post office box a signatory nation as many us corporations have indicated that they would like to do . 
  ( i think the likely reason is to take advantage of these special rights . ), 
  then everything completely changes . 
  they get the right to the condition of an open market continuing .
