  how much does a `` cadillac plan '' cost in the uk ? 
  as i said earlier , for some reason , people are going to great lengths to keep americans happily oblivious of tisa , ttip and even tpp . 
  ttip is frequently `` moderated '' as non-us as probably the person who posts the most on ftas , i am probably the person most familiar with the fact that all the larger subreddits here are not hospitable places for any posts about ftas , or public health care . 
  one of the dozen or so reasons given for deleting at least 70 % of the posts on them is `` not us news '' if it refers to ttip , the people in / r/politics and / r/news insist that / r/europe is the only place for it !, 
  public citizen is as good as it gets here in the us on the trade deals . . 
  i wish their web site was better . 
  clearly they do n't make that a priority . 
  however , they are not a blog , they are the # 1 source of info . 
  so , reddit trying to block them is * really f **** up * i 'm surprised you did n't know that they were the main us ngo on trade . 
  huh ? 
  jeff , i think you need to take a long hot bath . 
  unwind a little bit . . stop trying to `` win '' or `` shut out '' what i am saying . 
  i think you 're referring to a question ( ? ), 
  i asked you the other day , which you never answered !, 
  do you know ? 
  - since you claim to know so much about ftas , i asked you to [ watch this interview ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2014/6/20/a_plan_only_banksters_will_love ) , or read it , which is lori wallach being interviewed - on a very popular radio/cable tv show , ( democracy now ) she was interviewed in june about tisa . . she brought up something which has made me wonder a lot too . . tisa appears to be referring to gats and gats 's `` standstill '' . . 
  which was in 1994 or 1995 . 
  i wanted you to tell me what that means . . but you never did !, 
  it seems like it should be a simple question for you . 
  do you know ? 
  [ here is the leaked tisa chapter ] ( https://wikileaks.org/tisa-financial/ ) ( just one - financial services of probably dozens of chapters in tisa which is even more secret than ttip and tpp because its going to globally trade people and jobs like any other commodity . 
  tisa is the one which will probably effect health insurance services ( and health care services . . ) the most . 
  its basically like gats except more radical privatization and globalization will be mandated , and wider in scope . . and the most extreme - radical `` liberalization '' will be the default * unless there are explicit carve outs added now * . 
  you certainly do n't seem credible or convincing to me . 
  you show me even a single `` glaring hole in my logic '' as you say . 
  you certainly do n't . 
  like raising the minimum wage - or giving miners in a very dangerous mine a raise , or how about protecting their nation 's water supply from potential fouling . . ( which happened to the neighboring country already ) how about making a decision to back off of nuclear energy after an accident in a neighboring country created a problem with radioactivity that made some wild animals which had been hunted previously , already unsafe to eat , and after fukushima , the solar issue emerged which made it clear there was a global risk presented by solar storms which could cause a great many global radioactive meltdowns at the same time .

  thats true , as long as a ( wealthy or near bankrupted country 's - that matters not at all ) taxpayers are willing * and able * to pay corporations as much as ( 50 billion euros in a recent suit ) . 
  ( and then in some cases wait long periods , up to 20 years , i was told recently for the withdrawal to have effect . ), 
  they can buy back their country 's policy freedoms . 
   you cant `` overrule '' national laws with an isds no matter how much you and other people post on / r/europe about it . 
  isds clauses take the dispute out of national court systems and into international tribunals . 
  indeed . . *** money can buy a nation 's manumission *** . . 
  there is a discussion of this issue in the decision in [ achmea v. slovak republic ( ii ) ( near the end ) here ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) is n't that slick !, 
  three corporate lawyers moonlighting as judges get to decide huge issues of major national importance that have never been submitted to national referendum like public health care in the united states because they could never admit that the people would want a say so badly that the would win . 
  in fact , obamacare has been sold and kept in the united states by people like senator harry reid misrepresenting that obamacare ( privatization ) *** [ is a `` stepping stone to an eventual single payer system '' ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) .

  because of [ scott sinclair ] ( https://www.policyalternatives.ca/authors/scott-sinclair ) and his colleagues , http://policyalternatives.ca has very readable writing on ftas . 
  its among the best out there anywhere . 
  canada is a tiny country in terms of its population . 
  smaller than a lot of us states . 
  would you expect texas or california to have more than one ngo on what is intentionally made among the very difficult subjects to understand . 
  even practitioners often say that the subject is very difficult to understand . 
  the early ftas were made very ambiguous and that established the pattern of deliberate obfuscation . 
  its now well known that the drafters at that stage of these things intentionally made them difficult to understand to frustrate any attempt by the public from figuring out their agenda . 
  that did n't work well enough and now , at least in the us , they are now the subject of an enormous efforts at secrecy . . the governments which are pushing them have all made them secret ( although its easy to blame the us only , its all of them doing it ) the level of public lack of awareness in the us is nearly total , though . . 
  i am sure , the fact that 5 huge media corporations control almost all large us mass media helps . 
  [ watch this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9or5ecpe0de ) . 
  most cases never see a courtroom because they never happen . 
  thats the whole idea , to keep this out of the public eye and mind . 
  the term `` chilling effect '' is relevant here , as its used in copyright and patents . 
  the antigua - usa dispute over online gambling services is illuminating , as is achmea v. slovak republic : http://www.italaw.com/cases/417 http://www.italaw.com/cases/2564 as is the [ nafta dispute over single payer automobile insurance ] ( http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/nafta.pdf ) in ontario . 
  are you kidding ? 
  that statement is part of a shameless disinformation campaign to keep americans in the dark about the scope of the rights being given away by the legislators of both parties in collusion - it seems to me that desite the occasional hearing where they go to lengths to trivialize the magnitude of the problem ( smetimes its unavoidble ) the overwhelming tendency is to try to hide this issue . 
  they have to a great extent , joined together to not discuss the ftas any more than to pretend that they dont know the core issues at stake . 
  ( plausible deniability ) . 
  talk by us politicians these days is cheaper than air . 
  us political discourse and the issues described on blogs these days is a simulacrum , not real . . i.e , not unlike the truman show reality . . a fake tv land . 
  the fta agreements are the reality and the ftas are explicitly against any conceivable misinterpretation which places people above profit . 
  they [ reject any idea that suggests ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1261198/# ) that governments should or could [ have any way to limit prices ] ( http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2013/11/38-million-retirees-say-no-to-a-trade-deal-that-would-make-medicine-more-expensive.html ) . 
  visualize a feudal system tying the inhabitants of a land to always have to pay whatever is asked or pay whatever is asked ( they can not say no , we dont want it any more ) what would corporations do if given carte blanche to draw up binding deals to leverage their current positions of inappropriate and unwisely given power into permanent entitlement to tribute ? 
  one does n't have to look far into europe 's or especially , china 's 4000 year long recorded past to see the pattern . 
  the elites create a set of rules which impose an ever growing burden of tribute which grows ever more outrageous until the common people convulse with anger and shake that batch off , installing `` reformers '' who over the space of several generations become corrupt in turn and then the whole process repeats again . 
  you should read this paper - *** [ the potential impact of the world trade organization 's general agreement on trade in services on health system reform and regulation in the united states ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) *** also , obviously you do n't frequent the us subreddits because the minute you made a statement like you just did making the argument that government is responsible for health care quality in any way , the hordes of fake libertarian sock puppets who plague any public , un-access controlled us online discussion of health care would attack you making statements like this : `` what does health care have to do with government '' thats what you all have to look forward to . 
  you can join we americans in a real hell . 
  and to again answer your question , ttip is a multilateral ** investment ** agreement that as the video points out comes lock stock and barrel with a implicit frames which endorse as if they spoke ( they dont ) for - as their megalomaniac greed - goal of all humanity a broken backwards set of values * which frames compassion and equality as bad and privatization as so desirable that everything is structured to force it * force [ a very bad thing which more often than not fails miserably ] ( http://www.inthepublicinterest.org/sites/default/files/1213%20out_of_control.pdf ) but which facilitates looting - in a very sneaky way on countries and populations , then to keep this regime in place it , for free , gives corporations ownership of the market segments . . as in a new and previously unheard of invisible special entitlements worth billions of euros/dollars/zlotlys / pounds . . we all should be protesting this because its the largest theft in human history . 
  so outrageous that they get away with it because its impossible for normal people to believe - ( unless they have dealt previously with narcissistic personality disordered people or cults - thats what they are a cult ) - that they would be that stupid or evil !, 
  ttip , tisa , tpp and gats and nafta and dozens of others intended use is to irreversibly block public services at the moment they are needed the most . . block new and at every newly created opportunity ( movement ) like a noose , its intent is to transform every movement into a [ tightening of their *** ratchet *** ] ( http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/445656.html ) . 
  this isnt some anti-fta campaigner 's phrase , this is the way they are described to one another in the literature by its advocates . 
  so , health care in the usa is not locked up in privatization as they say , because the people have never and would never agree , we 've been [ promised single payer is right around the corner ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) , even as they work [ behind closed doors ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) to cut off any hope of it . 
  so we 're all in the same boat being fed the same lies . . 
  the us , uk , eu , as neo-liberals from all these nations team up to use the `` standstill '' ratchet and isds to dismantle the public health care and safety nets and deregulate every possible protection which they can think up a cockamamie legal theory to `` justify '' to some overworked legislators who they [ wont even let read the damn things except under surveillance ] ( http://www.ip-watch.org/2014/04/02/ttip-eu-commissioner-points-finger-at-us-secrecy-investor-state-provisions/ ) .
