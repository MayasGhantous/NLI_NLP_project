  so , they have been getting away with it , dismantling the safety nets of their own and other countries bit by bit . 
  if you subscribe to any of a number of services here in the us that provide - for a fairly reasonable amount of money , access to large numbers of * medicolegal * journals , or if you have access to a large university library which subscribes to them or similar , you can read about the strategy in legal journals dealing with * medical ethics * and law . . 
  if you live in the uk , i would also hunt down people like allison pollock who has written extensively on gats and the ftas and the impact on health care ( their privatization agenda ) bmj i think offers a feee basic subscription . . also pubmed.gov in the usa has ( for some reason ) only older papers on this issue , ( 1990s and before ) not more recent ones . . 
  if you are a serious researcher or a reporter or a blogger on medicolegal issues and can somehow prove that to me , i would be happy to spend the half hour or hour or so needed to put together an exhaustive list of such journal articles . 
  you could probably compile such a list yourself . 
  commercial services like hein online and jstor have free search . . ( you just cant read until you have access ) the university of california also has `` mylvyl '' search available ( i think ) from the public web . 
  ( the spelling might be slightly wrong ) perhaps you should also go to pubmed.gov and look up phrases like `` legal standard of care '' or `` gag clause '' there are free services too , google scholar , bepress , and many others . . 
  here , these two documents are a good snapshot of the us 's goals in terms of services not so long ago . 
  big chunks of the trade policy agenda laid bare . 
  tell me does this reflect even your values , jeff ?

  it has a lot to do with gats , which both the uk and us signed and endorsed . . because the us and some elements in the eu , push these ftas very aggressively . 
  in health care , its clear that privatization increases not decreases costs , btw !, 
  http://www.pnhp.org/resources/pnhp-research-the-case-for-a-national-health-program bookmark the link on the line above , you 'll find research that shows what i mean . 
  on the papers linked from above page almost every lie used in the us to sell the obama health care agenda is exposed . 
  unfortunately the current uk government is just as neoliberal as the obama , bush and clinton administrations are/were . . which means their goal is the ideological victory over the efforts to reduce inequality which flourished in the 20th century , replacing them with a set of documents that make it clear in no uncertain terms that ever increasing inequality is great , and desirable , and that efforts to reduce it are `` trade distorting '' or `` market barriers '' or `` monopolies '' or dozens of additional new frames which are so odious that they must go to great lengths to hide them , for now , from the public . . 
  some of them are explained here : http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/2005/divide_and_conquer.pdf https://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/competition-policy-wto-and-ftaa, 
  want to know what 's at stake here my friend ? 
  look at the prices here : http://pnhp.org/blog/2009/04/28/new-york-hmopos-death-spiral/, 
  the privatization is irreversible , thats a little explained part of the ftas beginning with gats . . 
  which the uk already signed . . thats why the nhs has been subjected to all the privatization that has occurred to date , you know . 
  do n't you folks realize that ? 
  no , my goodness , you have all been lied to too !, 
  just like us . 
  gats is only reversible by means of gats article 21 procedure which is made so expensive as to be intentionally impossible . . 
  it would cost a kings ransom , literally . 
  so , if these privatizations turn out to have been mistakes , there is no carve out so sorry . 
  [ read what happened to the slovaks ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) this letter explains what i mean . . also see the papers linked below .

  actually , canada 's health care system , which predated nafta , gats , and ceta - is under attack , as i am sure you must realize . . ( however , thanks to the ngo that wrote the linked documents - they have been fighting more effectively than other countries like the usa that have much less in the way of clearly written , well presented position papers spelling oyt the core issues . . which i link to some of here . . ** very important - if a system [ predates the ftas and is completely non-commercial meaning no privatization has already occurred ] ( http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/putting_health_first.pdf ) , it is in far better shape to withstand the fta attacks . . ** make no mistake , canada 's health care is under attack .

  they protect corporations from the normal functioning democracies and have a chilling effect on the ability of countries to bring about any kind of improvement ( as that might adversely affect some multinational corporation , and require huge compensation . ), 
  - politicians pretend this is n't the case because they want to be able to promise things which unfortunately , isds makes it so they can not deliver . 
  so in that respect , isds is criminogenic in that to win , a politician has to either expose the system , which means accusing the other politicians of being crooks , or they have to become a crook themselves by making promises they know they can not honor without changing this international system . 
  we americans have been lied to so much that 99 % dont even know about ftas , dont think isds could possibly exist when its explained to them , ( because it would be unconstitutional , is the common answer ) of course they have never heard of ttip , or tisa or gats ( they may have heard some vague things about tpp and copyrights ) but the most outragous way ttip has been hid is with blatant lies - millions now [ have been misled into thinking that single payer health care is right around the corner after obamacare !, 
  ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) obviously , americans still think that democracies still have full power to legislate when something needs to be changed . 
  ** even though the ustr has admitted to states that asked them explicitly that there were things they could not do - [ which coincidentally , blocked them ] ( http://www.maine.gov/legis/opla/ctpchlthcaresub.pdf ) from being able to offer actually affordable health care completely . 
  ** at the same time , politicians in other states ( vermont , massachusetts are promising some bizarre thing they call `` single payer '' but which is obviously not as its not single . . * as if there was [ no gats limit ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) at all !, 
  as long as they post it in groups that we americans rarely read . 
  they get deleted by moderators . 
  i have no idea if any pro-fta posts get deleted too . 
  ** however , i would not be surprised if even pro-ttip posts did get deleted because the intent of blocking them so aggressively is clearly to make it so americans have no idea that these ultra-secretive - completely unconstitutional `` talks '' are even taking place . 
  ** why do n't you try posting some pro-ttip posts in / r/politics and / r/news to see ? 
  you can say anything you want * as long as the common abbreviated name is mentioned as well as the important fact they are huge ftas , the largest ever , important to everybody in america , in other words , if i am right , a very high percentage of even your pro-fta posts that mentions them by name and obviously clues people in to the fact that they affect almost everybody , will get deleted on some pretext or other . 
  ( usually that they belong in some non-us or very lightly read group , like my attempts to post about the achmea v. slovak republic isds health care case . . they wanted me to post it in / r/slovakia - if you are successful in posting your * pro-ttip stuff * without making it look unimportant in the title , you win . 
  this is not for any prize , its just to ascertain the truth . 
  carve outs [ have to be explicit and go into these things before they are signed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) . 
  you do n't find that story a bit illuminating ? 
  why do n't you google '' [ stepping stone to single payer ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=stepping+stone+to+single+payer ) '' then . 
  read [ `` putting health first '' ] ( http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/putting_health_first.pdf ) [ reid says obamacare just a step toward eventual single-payer system - las vegas sun news ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ), 
  what they are doing is fighting a global war against the concept of a social contract . 
  people wont pay a lot more for things like healthcare and drugs if the government is involved acting on their behalf and paying part of the bill . 
  ** wealthy families in the us spend as much as $ 5000 a month on health insurance , to get a ppo plan that lets them go to any doctor . 
  everybody else who pays less gets care that 's limited and only around 10 % of all americans can afford even the most basic non-group coverage which could be remotely said to be adequate . 
  ** did you know that ? 
  isds in the ftas creates a system which overrules national laws . 
  dont you know that ? 
  `` investor-state dispute settlement '' or isds . 
  its true , the point they close with about the ideological agenda that the ftas try to lock in forever , is the most important thing that can be said - and it needs to be explained explicitly . 
  there is no way to whitewash this , or how much americans have been lied to to sell it . 
  for example , see https://www.google.com/#q=stepping%2bstone%2bto%2bsingle%2bpayer, 
  i dont know f a single country where people voted for this bs . 
  americans certainly didnt vote for anything . 
  if you picked 1000 americans , they have been repeatedly told that obamacare was a [ stepping stone to single payer ] ( https://www.google.com/#q=stepping%2bstone%2bto%2bsingle%2bpayer ) . . 
  there is much more to it than just that . 
  the goal is to make the standard of care expected to be delivered to the poor nothing or almost nothing , the working class a little bit more , the middle class a little bit more , with onl the very wealthy getting what could be described as midern , good quality health care . 
  this is a process that takes years . 
  ** google `` national city lines '' to see how it was done with public transit in the us . 
  ** thats one of the biggest reasons why we have such high social stratification , and the us underclass . 
  they destroyed public transit in the us to force people to buy cars . 
  seriously . 
  ** they were convicted of it . 
  i think you 're attempting to cover up one of the most hideous things that exist in the modern world , something which is clearly identifiable as [ ` atomization ' , a prelude to totalitarianism . 
  ] ( http://archive.org/details/originsoftotalit00aren ), 
  what the hell is going on in the story from st louis ( the two stories linked below ) this appears to me to be an act with major gats implications . . where does the kmov story fit in ? 
  it may be a smoking gun on the use of the ( already existing ) gats fta to lock in for private health care in the us , even if this whole scandal is exposed . 
  note who serco is . 
  a major player in global privatization . 
  http://www.kmov.com/news/investigates/more-workers-from-aca-contractor-say-employees-are-paid-for-no-work-259595671.html http://www.kmov.com/news/investigates/news-4-investigates-workers-paid-taxpayer-dollars-to-do-nothing-259002161.html perhaps the answer is the `` lock in '' which is explained well in [ this paper . 
  this skala paper ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) which is a must read . 
  its 27 year old author , nick skala , a brilliant law student and [ single payer activist ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwbzz070m-k ) , died suddenly on august 8 , 2009 , in chicago , shortly after it was published . 
  i think you are angry that all these facts are emerging that collectively make the intent of these things crystal clear . 
  this issue is one which all of us , including we americans why by and large have been lied to on a level which any european would not believe unless they had actually experienced it . 
  example : obamacare and the subsequent mess has been sold to us * as a stepping stone to single payer , * please look at this : [ reid says obamacare just a step toward eventual single-payer system - las vegas sun news ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ), 
  what you are really objecting to is the fact that the default trust which the supporters of these things used for exploit for so long to slip them in under the radar - is gone . 
  so now you can no longer , at least here in / r/europe , pretend that these ugly facts are `` conspiracy theories '' and that your usually unsupported assertions deserve trust and little in the way of actual scrutiny for whether they are true or not ( they arent , as shown by the fact that its now again been admitted that the ttip . 
  gats , tisa , tpp main intent is a one way privatization of public services and elimination of a government model that attempts to lower prices , isolating citizens when they most need help , when they are sick . . what they do is a covert undermining of global social contract , globally , exactly the time when a social safety net is most needed . ), 
  people here often try to imply that americans are pro ftas and accept ftas like ttip , tisa and tpp . 
  the fact is , there is clearly a conspiracy of silence and active campaign on sites like reddit to block out any information on them especially from americans . 
  especially on the big subreddits where lots of americans are reading , more often than not , stories about ttip , tisa , tpp , gats , tafta , nafta , cafta ( especially ones that use the initials or which spell out the names ) get deleted on various excuses , reasons are all over the map but the most frequent is that they often claim that all fta releted news is not american - not about america !, 
  another common one is the one / u/savannajeff tries to use below : '' '' [ -- ] australiasavannajeff [ score hidden ] an hour ago   *** `` do n't link to blogs as a source . 
  '' *** [ -- ] untied stateschrist0ph [ s ] 1 point 17 minutes ago  public citizen ( http://citizen.org ) is not a blog . 
  as you see , he 's trying to silence me using a really lame excuse . 
  public citizen is the oldest , most respected consumer and public interest organization in the us . 
  and they are the leading voice oon trade issues . 
  its not a private blog . 
  so , i have written the moderators of / r/politics many times telling them this and they still block all stories from eyesontrade.typepad.com and citizen.typepad.com . 
  if you care about americans being able to finally learn about ftas and that these things are bad for us too , write them and tell them that blocking posts from public citizen sites is wrong . 
  i moved a response i had written here at this level - about censor ship on some reddit groups of ttip , tisa , tpp , gats and all other ftas and public healthcare issues - a squelching of everything which could clue americans in about these monstrosities - basically - up to a higher comment level so it can be seen if people want to see it .
