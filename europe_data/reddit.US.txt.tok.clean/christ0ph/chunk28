  basically , we americans are being subjected to a north korea like information blockade of this issue . 
  ( note - i dont make that comparison lightly , i have been interested in and fighting the nk information blockade for  15 years . ), 
  on many subreddits pretty much all ttip and free trade agreement ( and single payer healthcare ) related posts get silently moderated away into oblivion more often than not . 
  that means that americans dont ever see anything at all about these ftas and 99 % of us dont even know they exist . 
  this allows the neoliberals to pretend that americans would support their policies when in fact americans were lied to about obama ( told he was left wing ) and obamacare ( told it was a liberal and not a conservative , right wing ideologically coercive mess designed to [ lock the country into for profit healthcare ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) against our will ), 
  but at that point - wont it be * too late ? 
  * ( shhh !, 
  big secret ! ), 
  public citizen ( http://citizen.org ) is not a blog . 
  why does it makes no sense ? 
  it makes a lot of sense to them . 
  the us drug industry spends a lot of money on politicians , and they always want something for that money . 
  they get it . 
  they politicos do n't get all that money to look pretty . 
  also its the principle of the thing . 
  poor people are poor and so they must be not so subtly punished for being so . 
  rich people must pay more and get more . 
  systems that varnish that are `` trade distorting '' or `` market distorting '' or `` trade barriers '' , or `` market access barriers '' . 
  they * devalue markets . 
  * they are framed by neoliberals as a theft from the rightful owners , corporate vendors of those products or services . 
  also , its an ideological battle , like the domino theory . 
  if the us allows public healthcare to persist anywhere , it might spread , like a cancer of abnormal value , poisoning profits . 
  thats why the ftas literally lock in bad decisions and corrupt decisions *** forever *** . 
  right now uk healthcare is free to the end users , but the us and eu neoliberals ( this is just their general philosophy ) feel that is a trade distorting subsidy because it does not offer poor people the `` opportunity '' to get less healthcare for their less money and rich people the opportunity to get more for more money . 
  ** its a matter of principle ** . 
  equality is wrong . 
  poor people must get less , rich people must get more or be able to opt out and take their money away leaving the system to collapse on itself . 
  but of course they can not say that , so all of the ways they do the things they do are based on gats . 
  see this document . 
  : http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm the approach they covertly want would be like the us where poor people would get very cheap ( as in less or no , - in other words , much much less than now ) and rich people could pay to get a lot more . 
  then they would use that as a starting point to increase profits still more . 
  the system has to be set up to pass costs to the end user as much as possible . . see `` skin in the game '' . 
  ultimately they want a flat tax that results in a higher cost to the poor and a lower cost for the wealthy , ( who will often move their assets around so they can pay no tax at all . ), 
  they feel that by cutting the insurance companies out of the deal , the uk is also stealing from them . 
  also , they blame high us drug prices on the public healthcare in other countries because they claim that forces the companies to shift their costs to the us which they allege spends huge amounts of money on research . 
  ( which is a lie , see here ) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1261198/ to see how the blowback of these policies effects americans see here : http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2013/11/38-million-retirees-say-no-to-a-trade-deal-that-would-make-medicine-more-expensive.html the first paper on drug prices is a very good one because it breaks it all down deconstructing their bs . 
  the us drug companies spend far more money on ceos , ** lobbying ** , advertising and dividends than they do on research . 
  ( they have been doing that for decades . ), 
  now eu companies patent more drugs . 
  eu companies are highly regulated . 
  they are still highly profitable . 
  the us drug companies have been getting their way for a long time and they are very , very spoiled . 
  if you look at us healthcare policy its 100 % corporate . 
  the people dont figure in this at all . 
  we are just like nothing to them . 
  their real agenda is raising health care and drug prices . 
  [ isds must go ] ( http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1264&amp;context=matthew_rimmer ), 
  you can read the [ neoliberal arguments in here ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) : its about the us but it all should apply to the uk too because you also signed gats . 
  something like this happened in the us , in new jersey , a few years ago . 
  the title sounds editorialized at first glance but if you watch the video and then investigate the facts , its 100 % true . 
  there is an ideological battle going on for the future of healthcare and society . 
  in their model , the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and that 's carved in stone by bad policy . 
  they are competing against the model which the nhs illustrates which sees a need for everybody to get the best possible quality health care because that reduces costs and has a ripple effect which helps all of society . 
  they feel as if that is preventing a general `` atomization '' and breaking down of the social contract , with their ideal being each person or family isolated and alone with no alternatives to go to for help . 
  that situation which we increasingly are dealing with in the us , is their profit maximization strategy . 
  its also a prelude to totalitarianism . 
  ( [ see arendt `` the origins of totalitarianism '' ] ( http://archive.org/details/originsoftotalit00aren ) 2nd chapter onward ) the way they see public healthcare is identical to the domino theory advanced in the 1970s and 1980s to justify us support of right wing dictatorships around the world . 
  they are against public healthcare and the reduction of inequality . 
  look at the fight by the us drug industry against government negotiation on drug prices , and by us agribusiness against `` trade distorting subsidies '' - basically provision of food to the poor . 
  they seem to almost always try to overtly or covertly oppose measures that reduce inequality . 
  see these documents for a good explanation . 
  slobodan milosevich was put on trial . 
  there is n't any statute of limitations for these crimes against humanity , so even after twenty or thirty , or even fifty or sixty or more years have passed , its important that they be put on trial . 
  i do n't know how i feel . 
  i would n't want to wear the clothes but at the same time , the people who owned them are dead . 
  i have a feeling that if i were dead , not needing them any more , i would n't care . 
  i would probably hope they went to some good use . 
  now every time those people put on those clothes , they will think of the passengers of mh17 . 
  i actually think thats a good thing . 
  war is really a horrible thing . 
  a nuclear war would destroy all humanity . 
  if any survived , it would be so horrible that they would probably envy the dead . 
  even a limited nuclear war has been estimated to kill 2 billion of the worlds people because the price of food would double . 
  most of those deaths would be children . 
  they would die from starvation and be distributed all around the globe . 
  they were cool until sometime in the early 90s - then - boom, 
  margaret thatcher , tony blair and david cameron ? 
   what happened to you england , you used to be cool we here in the us have had a similar bad run of * politicians * . 
  there are dozens of endocrine disruptors , and they are building up in people 's bodies . 
  these chemicals never existed in the environment before . 
  the science is extremely compelling , however , very few people are aware of it , it seems . 
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2713042/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3279464/ http://endocrinedisruption.org/endocrine-disruption/introduction/overview, 
   hopefully any toxins we are facing should be in moderation so that they do n't cause such mass epidemics of obesity why and how could that be if they go unregulated ? 
  99.99 % of us have no idea that they are even there . 
  they are in things that we are constantly in contact with , like ( just a few examples ) dental restorations , non-stick cookware , food packaging , and sleepwear/mattresses . 
  the problem is these chemicals are everywhere and the amounts seen in people 's bodies are increasing steadily . 
  we 're already way past the point where they have effects . 
  these chemicals change the body 's energy set point so they do make people fat . 
  they do n't have to eat more food , they just get fatter . 
  many of them mimic or block the action of sex hormones . 
  yes , thats true . 
  but , all other things being equal , when they give lab animals these chemicals , they ( and often their offspring ) get fatter in a dose-response relationship . 
  bruce blumberg invented the term obesogen and he 's written extensively on the subject http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=blumberg%20b[author]&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=25218215, 
  endocrine disruptors in the environment ( chemicals called obesogens in nonstick cookware , plastic food can liners , supermarket receipts , dental restorations , pipes , water bottles , pesticides , and so on . 
  they cause morbid obesity . 
  isds `` courts '' dont challenge local laws in court , they are private * supra-national * courts where countries have to defend themselves against international corporations . . the corporations usually settle for huge amounts of money . 
  or win . 
  countries have to pay if its found they are violating the fta . 
  nothing else matters . 
  none of those kinds of laws we are used to matters at all .
