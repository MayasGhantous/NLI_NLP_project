  everything is backwards . 
  giving people things is bad , for example . 
  its theft . 
  those cases are arbitral cases and they are brought in private courts . 
  you can read them at italaw.com . 
  [ here is an example ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) . 
  except now , with its arrogance and its embrace of isds and arrogant , undemocratic , bad bad trade policy , the eu is rapidly becoming another united states in terms of ultimately unsustainable , wrong , greedy , self-destructive policy decisions . 
  read page 9 of this pdf , http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/nafta.pdf the portion entitled ( the title is on page 8 ) `` a cautionary tale '' . 
  that will introduce you to the core concepts . 
  well , the date an fta is signed is a standstill , after that date then nothing can occur which adversely effects foreign corporate investors profits without it allegedly , unconstitutionally ( this supersedes the constitution ) being entitled to compensation from the taxpayers as a `` taking '' . 
  lawmakers can pass laws but when those laws are implemented the country can and does get sued . 
  for example , a french company sued egypt under isds * for increasing egypts minimum wage * . 
  i wish . 
  look , dont feel bad , nobody knows they are doing this . 
  they are going to great lenths to prevent most americans from having a clue that this is happening . 
  and its easy to see why . 
  this is the most outrageous thing that has ever been done against the people of this country and the world thats not genocide or similar . 
  but , to answer your question . . social security was created in 1934 * so it pre-existed gats * , and would be likely to be able to avoid the gats mandate to privatize if they do not or have not changed anything . 
  but they have and do change things , and that changes everything . 
  if any of social security is privatized , [ thats it , gats will destroy it ] ( http://www.citizen.org/documents/sos-1_socsec_final_0606.pdf ) . 
  thats how gats and its ilk are designed . 
  thats their goal . 
  as far as gats is concerned , i think the risk of gats or some similar fta eventually being used to tear apart social security is almost 100 % . 
  see this link : [ sos # 1 how new global `` trade '' talks threaten social security and medicare ] ( http://www.citizen.org/documents/sos-1_socsec_final_0606.pdf ) i think its inevitable if we stay on the path we 're on . 
  source ? 
  your assertions are unproved by facts . 
  show me those * new * public services in the us . 
  you 're not going to find any , nor will you find practically any honest explanations of why that is so , not unless you are [ very lucky ] ( http://www.maine.gov/legis/opla/ctpchlthcaresub.pdf ) . 
  instead 99.99999 % of the time , you 're just going to find lies and bs . 
  you do n't mention that canada 's healthcare is threatened by gats and now by ceta , or how . 
  you dont mention gats , nor do you mention the reasons why [ nafta ] ( http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/nafta.pdf ) and gats were significant , or their impact on services . 
  you dont explain what a `` standstill '' clause in an fta means or how it blocks any and all new services and you do n't mention ratchet - how that forces the incremental privatization of all public services whenever even the tiniest part becomes privatized - that country 's entire market segment is eventually forced to privatize . 
  thats the fta 's extremism that has to be hidden . 
  thats their secret intent .

  well , after yugoslavia broke apart they had genocide , war , etc. 
  was pre isds capitalism , before the heavy weapons in the trade pacts emerged , true capitalism ? 
  thats a valid question seeing how investor-state and its ilk are being used to attack the public interest in country after country . 
  the trade deals are a new legal regimen that supersedes the national laws , including the us constitution , in economic matters , which is basically almost everything , the way they frame it . 
  basically , any change a government makes which adversely effects a corporation can be the grounds for an `` investor-versus-state '' arbitration suit for billions of dollars against the country by a corporation . 
  el salvador is being sued because they dont want to let a mining company mine in a manner which would be extremely likely to pollute their country 's sole source of fresh water . 
  what 's happened is that in the last 20 years , a real monster has been created in the form of this isds , standstill and ratchet stuff that turns capitalism into something far worse , really far far worse , than what we all grew up with . 
  but the official trade policy of the us is in effect forcing *** privatization *** of every single thing you mentioned , on other countries , if they want to trade with us . 
  those trade pacts are also forcing the us to privatize all those things as well . 
  ( almost no americans realize this , and for good reason , we would not agree with it ) i would be happy to show you how that is being done . 
  just look closely at the three pending ( secrtive ) trade deals . . tisa , ttip and tpp , and gats , nafta , cafta , etc. 
  their predecessors . 
  the eu is doing it too . 
  just look at all the isds cases on italaw.com where some us or eu entity sues some small country because their social programs violate some trade deals mandate to allow unfettered capitalism . 
  egypt was even sued for raising their minimum wage . 
  slovak republic was sued by a dutch insurance firm , achmea , ( formerly eureko ) for trying to switch to single payer after they had signed a bit which had isds and a standstill clause . 
  ( the suit stopped them ), 
  well , if they sign a free trade agreement , that becomes a lock , thereafter they can not change their minds , apparently , [ if slovakia 's experience with a bit and healthcare ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) is any guide . 
  i 've been told repeatedly that in russia - immediately after the changeover , basically all of the state owned enterprises were instantly sold off at what people gathered were insanely low prices by people who had organized crime/government connections . . those people are the russian oligarchs of today , and they are incredibly wealthy , even by western standsrds . 
  ( in russia they called them `` new russians '' . 
  they were basically organized crime . ), 
  ** its still the exact same people running things , they just changed their skins so to speak . 
  yes , exactly . . the grass is always greener syndrome . 
  this is not good . 
  i suspect that they may have been forgetting the bad aspects of it , or perhaps have been too young then to realize how repressive and spirit crushing most of those regimes were , and how many lives they ruined . 
  by the 80s , most of the regimes in eastern europe had changed their modus operandi to a much less visible kind of oppression . 
  for example , in east germany , the stasi was still ruining many people 's lives but being much less obvious about it . 
  or so the scholars tell us . 
  ** edit : thinking about this , i think its important to point out that a newer , uglier capitalism is emerging in the form of the hidden and secretive `` investor-state '' ( isds ) `` ratchet '' , `` standstill '' , etc. ), 
  clauses in too many trade deals that now - are attacking the public interest aggressively !, 
  ** isds = investor state dispute settlement = really controversial `` super-rights '' for corporations that supersede national laws whenever they adversely effect the economic interests of corporations , the countries , and their taxpayers must now pay !, 
  governments are being sued for merely doing what their people have voted for . 
  and the corporations are winning these cases or stopping the behavior they sued about ( like single payer health care in achmea v. slovak republic ) often after a suit has been filed , corporations `` settle for '' huge but confidential payoffs ( which is basically winning ) its been estimated that some outcome which is against the public interest occurs in  70 % of them . 
  this stuff is an urgent , direct threat to democracy and the rule of law that is more serious than communism because it comes from within . 
  how screwed up this all is . 
  just make friends wit them . 
  be nice to them . 
  try invitig them over for dinner , a video or something , ive been friends with a lot of iranians in the us . . 
  they are often great people . 
  they have great parties . 
  lots of dancing . . 
  they are smart , many are quite successful . 
  `` their '' but , speaking about these people , what could be more stupid than that ? 
  i suppose there is no better way to remain ignorant than never speaking to anybody who is even the slightest bit different than you . 
  god forbid they might learn something . 
  the core tenets of the neoliberal `` religion '' which is being pushed by the us and eu ( which is largely unknown to most americans and europeans ) is hideously evil . 
  for example , look at investor-state dispute settlement ( isds ) which is the philosophy that allowed a french company to sue the state of egypt - * for raising their minimum wage * . 
  and it allowed a dutch firm to sue slovakia * for voting for and stating their intent to implement single payer health care for everybody * . 
  right now * el salvador is being sued for not letting a company mine there when the mining would require a serious risk of fouling the country 's only water supply . 
  * that is madness . 
  99 % of my fellow americans ( at least ) know so little about this that they just assume i am wrong when i tell them about them . 
  but i am not . 
  i think the likelihood of that statement being true in any population is around 0 %  * `` so that 's the reason why 84 % of muslims in egypt and 86 % in jordan is for death penalty for people who leave the religion ? 
  '' * seriously , every muslim i have ever known ( and ive known quite a few ) would have serious exception to a statement like that . 
  that makes sense . 
  the key to economic self-sufficiency and transcending greed and discrimination around the world is education . 
  the reason we are seeing all this madness is that low skill jobs are going away globally , ad the key to maintaining employment is learning . 
  every dollar that is spent on wars and not on learning is another mstake . 
  how will our species ever survive to go to the stars if we dont rise above this madness ? 
  if there is one core piece of wisdom which can be gleaned from the world 's religions its `` do unto others as you would have them do unto you '' . 
  that would also be a good piece of advice for inter-species interactions in the future out in space . 
  or even future interactions between humans and future self-aware machines . 
  wherever we came from , in the final analysis , we are all better off getting along than fighting . 
  all will then benefit . 
  all churches should be protesting .
