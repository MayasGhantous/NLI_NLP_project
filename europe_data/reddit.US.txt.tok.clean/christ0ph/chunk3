  what difference does that make ? 
  does anybody know if any of these planes carry ads-b transponders ? 
  ( wondering if anybody with a receiver - a $ 12 rtl2832 usb dvb-t dongle will do it ) has a record of the encounters . . 
  i am not the op but , here is what i suspect is one of their goals , which they can not tell us . 
  i think the ftas are increasingly used , to play groups off against each other , internationally , to keep wages and costs down . 
  another is dismantling the safety net now just as the developed countries really need it . 
  because the world is transitioning to a economy which is much more dependent on automation and much less on many kinds of workers . 
  privatizations are one way , its quite similar to gats in that respect , in fact , ttip refers to gats so much in its `` mandate '' document that i suspect a great deal could be learned by reading up on gats on sites like policyalternatives.ca just do a search for gats there . 
  a good start is `` facing the facts , a guide to the gats debate '' . . you also might want to read this essay '' [ gats and public service systems ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) '' the protections that its advocates talk up are illusory in practice . . 
  here is **[bilaterals.org index of articles about ttip ] ( http://www.bilaterals.org/?-ttip - ) ** and ------- cut here ------------ ** [ isds - 10 reasons why europe and america do not need business v state dispute rules ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/transport%20environment%20isds%20ttip.html ) ** here is their 10 reasons list . . ( the footnotes are lengthy and can be found at the article which is linked to above / [ ( also_here ) ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/transport%20environment%20isds%20ttip.html ) ) * for clarity 's sake , here 's our top-10 reasons why excluding isds from ttip is the only right way forward . 
  * - isds introduces the * ` fright to regulate ' * which is bad for people and the planet . 
  the all-encompassing result of the flaws of the isds system -- outlined further below - is that governments will feel a sword of damocles hanging over their heads when they plan public-interest regulations on companies . 
  the european commission 's argument that nothing in isds affects the ` right to regulate ' is beside the point . 
  the threat of a costly legal dispute with a very uncertain outcome will act as a deterrent for many governments to protect citizens or the environment . 
  - isds uses citizens ' money to bail out corporations for risky investments : in total ttip would enable 75,000 companies to seek damages from eu and us governments ( hence citizens , through taxes ) . 
  [ 4 ] although isds became a regular feature of investment treaties in the 1960s , claims have ballooned over the past decade : 57 known new cases were launched in 2013 alone . 
  - isds grants special rights to foreign investors over everybody else . 
  only foreign investors can use isds panels ; domestic ones , let alone normal citizens , have to keep using the regular legal system . 
  - isds upsets legal systems , introducing arbitration on legislation . 
  dispute settlement systems in normal treaties seek to resolve conflicts directly related to the treaty . 
  isds , in contrast , allows companies to sue government for any legislation they deem unfair or inequitable that is developed after the treaty ; effectively introducing arbitration on legislation . 
  isds does not even require ` exhaustion of local remedies ' -- further undermining democracy and the rule of law . 
  isds is not intended as a last resort should all other legal routes fail ; it is explicitly designed to take place outside the normal legal systems . 
  - isds is not bound to legal precedent , ignoring the abc of international law and introducing further uncertainty : the lack of case law in isds has led to inconsistent arbitral decisions with different legal interpretations of identical or similar treaty provisions , further increasing uncertainty and fear referred to in point 1 . 
  - isds is the only international dispute settlement giving rights to corporations instead of states : dispute settlement procedures in other international treaties are state-state - even the world trade organisation dispute settlement is state-state . 
  - eu-level isds has never been impact-assessed : isds is a new eu level policy that can result in billions of euros flowing from eu citizens to foreign corporations in the future . 
  despite this , the european commission has not bothered to prepare an impact assessment on it , in dire contradiction with its own guidelines , [ 5 ] and just started to insert it in trade agreements it started to negotiate after the lisbon treaty . 
  - isds proceedings take place out of the public eye : isds cases are held behind closed doors and are fully confidential , even if cases being disputed involve matters of public interest . 
  - isds is unnecessary . 
  even almost without isds , the eu and us already trade gargantuan volumes : both blocs barter around $ 1.6 billion ( $ 2.2 billion ) [ 6 ] in goods and services every day , with more than $ 2.6 trillion ( $ 3.5 trillion ) in two-way direct investment per year [ 7 ] -- all this with only one-third of eu countries ( or 7 % of eu 's gdp ) covered by isds . 
  apparently investors already place significant trust in the regular legal systems . 
  - better alternatives exist : whereas isds is a subsidy , from the public purse , for activities at risk from tighter regulations , risk insurance is offered by a host of private providers but also for example by the multilateral investment guarantee agency ( a division of the world bank ) and others . 
  [ 8 ] these 10 flaws are so intrinsic to the very system of isds that a reform -- as proposed by the european commission -- simply can not address them . 
  europe needs to follow the lead of countries like australia , brazil and india , and ditch isds instead of imposing it to the 93 % of the eu economy that has so far deemed it unnecessary . 
  maybe they are surveying the radar and radio response to the incursions - and recording it . 
  thats a little drastic , do n't you think ? 
  i do n't see that happening . 
  okay , lets see . . 
  well , the us has no reason for people to be included in statistics like most countries in the eu do , so unemployment stats in the us are very inaccurate . . 
  they greatly understate the employment situation here . 
  does she mean simply a physical book , cover to cover , ( understandable if she now reads books converted to ebook form ) or `` not read any new literature '' ( very bad ), 
  no , its not the same thing at all , as the rate of change increases exponentially . 
  so , the level of technological change which took a generation to occur 200 years ago , takes maybe , at the most three or four years today . 
  see a discussion about [ why people oftentimes do n't see that ] ( http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns ) here . 
  why ca n't you look at the issues which i am bringing up ? 
  because you know that i am bringing up important points . 
  i think we are both taking the same position , that the other is not engaging in good faith . 
  except i am . 
  lol . 
  but seriously , i am . 
  and i 'm not alone in making these arguments . 
  anything done in secret is probably bad . 
  i think that putting dishonest public officials , and cops in jail would be a good thing , since its an abuse of trust . 
  i 'm not `` pressuring you '' sorry if it sounded like i was . . 
  i was just trying to point out that a ** double standard ** should not be applied . 
  that says very good things about france to me . . that she is now a minister of culture , an extremely important issue to the french . 
  ( and rightfully so , i think ) i wish her the best of luck ... 
  discrimination against unwed mothers and their children , poverty . 
  wow - yes , both koreas were very poor in the past , now its north korea where the starvation occurs . 
  okay , here is my problem with the current situation . 
  the fact that they keep the texts of these agreements secret means that i can not take segments in the leaked documents at face value , because they are likely to change in either direction . 
  it would make a lot of sense for people to take a position that all of these agreements should be negotiated transparently and openly , in some new structure that allowed input nationally . . an online structure which itself could be hashed out first ... then it would be a simple matter to put these things up for a referendum if they limited democracy and regulatory adjustment of core issues in any way . 
  right now we have '' [ fright to regulate as described here ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/transport%20environment%20isds%20ttip.html ) '' , and thats not a good situation at all . 
  [ link to a long list of organizations ] ( http://www.bilaterals.org/?-social-movements - ) who take a critical look at the so called `` free trade '' ideology and its so called `` agreements '' . 
  please tone down your language . 
  its abrasive . 
  if you fail to even consider the arguments of the people who are speaking up against this power grab and why , you are not a scientist nor do you deserve to be claiming some authority status based on theses which you have not made available for reading . 
  you are repeating canned arguments about ftas which have been shown to be wildly misleading many times . 
  that is what facing the facts is about , read it . 
  look at what happened in the usa to see what they probably plan . . google `` national city lines '' to see how the us went from having one of the best to one of the worst public transit systems in the world in only 30 years . 
  they did it to force people to buy cars and to take the space that trolleys used to run in on streets for more cars , but it also arguably created the us 's underclass . 
  these people do deserve compensation . 
  so do their parents , if still alive . 
  otherwise it will happen again . 
  in the us children are taken away from poor parents all the time . 
  they are usually not adopted off - they are put into a truly horrible foster care system until the day they turn 18 and then they are on their own . 
  lots of young women are forced to give up infant children for adoption who are then basically sold - but that 's another issue . 
  if they send the poor to jail , they really should send those wealthy people who steal to jail - for a proportionately longer time , as they appear to have each stolen far far much more . 
  also , what are countries going to do as jobs vanish and automation becomes the norm rather than the exception ? 
  they need to understand that jobs simply do n't exist for those poor and usually fairly unskilled people and stop trying to punish them . 
  read it , read the whole thing . 
  you can skim . 
  clearly the 2008 election was a joint effort on the part of both parties to cover up a scheme to deceive the american people on health care , ( in other words , using isds to lock the country into bad hc . . more truly * criminogenic * deregulation of the financial industry/bailouts more fracking and a big bailout of the ponzi scheme for frackers , in ttip ... and continued militarism . 
  look at [ how they sold ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) aca ( privatization of health care ), 
  is it your habit to attack the messenger when you know you 're wrong ? 
  well , its author suddenly died . 
  just a few weeks after he [ made this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwbzz070m-k ) . 
  here is a good guide to the gats debate . . '' [ facing facts ] ( http://policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/facing-facts ) '', 
  this is useful , worth saving and keeping in order to understand these fta schedules . . http://www.normangirvan.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/kelsey-1-how-to-read-a-schedule1.pdf bear in mind , its both old , and its about another fta . . however , its an fta gats , which ttip explicitly refers to . 
  [ this is also useful ] ( http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/2005/divide_and_conquer.pdf ) for understanding the value system . . or lack of it . 
  `` what they want '' so is this . . https://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/facing-facts, 
  [ this shows ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) how they operate , in the us , on a crucial issue , health care . 
  what i am saying is that the `` amoral system '' which these ftas exemplify is not the value system of americans . 
  its alien to us . 
  they manage to get it as far as they have , by hiding it from us . 
  well , its the ustr 's position that us ftas * bar any new public healthcare * , right ? 
  yes , [ thats shown here ] ( http://www.maine.gov/legis/opla/ctpchlthcaresub.pdf ) ...
