  i think that this extremism is fairly new . 
  its not intrinsic to islam any more than the inquisition was intrinsic to christianity . 
  extremism , religious or not , is wrong . 
  its also often seriously wrong when countries attempt to impose their will on others by force . 
  she is n't a doctor , just a med student . 
  and hopefully not for long . 
  i hope that her university expels her when/if she ever comes back . 
  she should never be allowed anywhere near the medical profession . 
  i 'm sure this is not true . 
  this story sounds like bs . 
  i would be surprised if more than 1000 people in the entire us realized what was going on with the ftas and health care or how . 
   300 million people 's future healthcare and probably at least a third to a half million dollars in unnecesssary spending per person . 
  that much money pays for a lot of disinformation . 
  how else can i put this ? 
  its not some little thing - and the fact that its being hidden shows that there is intent to mislead . 
  i 'll be honest , i 've only heard good about the nhs , but as soon as i read that they had started to privatize parts of it i realized that gats was designed to wedge open the door and force an eventual privatization of the entire system . 
  the canadian ngo policy alternatives has an essay called [ putting health first ] ( http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/putting_health_first.pdf ) that shows why keeping their system completely free is essential to avoid the gats trap as they put it . 
  i am interested in where you think i 'm wrong . . 
  but , this is what i 've distilled and as far as i can tell its right . . as i understand it , standstill , ratchet , and isds together create a kind of trap which prevents the essential function of democracy - adjusting to changing times - from being possible insomuch as it might conceivably result in regulation which might `` adversely effect '' some corporation . 
  in other words , it eliminates their need to work with countries , and basically guarantees them profits at the expense of democracy ... 
  this regime - when it applies to services , prevents any new public services that compete with existing for profit industries , nomatter how limited in scope. , framing the public services as evil `` government monopolies '' . 
  isds also freezes the ability of governments to regulate if the things they do adversely effect ( any ? ), 
  foreign investors corporations profits - [ their taxpayers can be sued ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) . 
  for huge amounts of money . 
  the ftas are designed to create a global regime *** under the pretext of trade deals *** that mandates what is in effect a one way street to a privatized future for almost everything - services which in the past and to many of us , present , which are seen as public goods , are being targeted covertly to be privatized and commoditized - it should be recognized that this is silently taking away all that is good about governments - things which citizens still think their governments could do , never having had been told that they had signed away a country 's right to make positive changes - for example , the american public was told in 2008-9 that there could be a discussion about health care reform , but its now obvious that there could not have been , due to gats , unless you define `` health care reform '' as being exactly what they presented us with , which it was clear could not make health care affordable . 
  a good argument could however be made that the real goal was proping up prices despite their lack of sustainability . . 
  i think its clear that [ because of the gats and its ilk ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) there was a backroom decision made that no real debate could be allowed or even remotely possible because the problems could only be solved by real changes that clearly would violate these covert agreements . 
  which still can not be discussed honestly in the us without attracting efforts to blot out the facts . . is a maximal state of inequality the desired global outcome ? 
  not everything is privatized ? 
  very narrow exceptions seem to exist , ambiguously , for the actual governments themselves . 
  however , many many things which many have come to associate with governments like public education , and in some countries , health care , are framed as commodities and as `` market access barriers '' or `` trade barriers '' making it clear that they are not seen as a public good or as essential by the ftas . 
  they are seen as a target for profitmaking activity and that profitmaking is seen as infinitely more important than the education or the nation or provision of healthcare to its citizens . 
  how is my assessment wrong ? 
  multinationals in the eu [ use isds and file these truly horrible investor-state suits ] ( http://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?originalversionid=453 ) against countries too . 
  multinationals are multinational - they are a supranational construction . 
  lots of companies span multiple countries . 
  the governments of the eu and us unfortunately are controlled by the various corporate special interests to a degree that boggles the imagination . 
  americans , particularly , are really profoundly unaware of how pervasive and total this control is . 
  there is more knowledge and discussion in europe ( as shown by the fact that this conversation is occurring . ), 
  if you want to see some examples of what can happen with [ isds ] ( http://tpplegal.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/isds-domestic-legal-process-background-brief.pdf ) ( investor-state artificially created corporate `` rights '' ) standstill , ratchet , etc , you can look up investor-state cases and see the actual case documents ( ! ), 
  on http://italaw.com also , here is the unctad [ analysis of isds cases globally ] ( http://unctad.org/en/publicationslibrary/webdiaepcb2013d3_en.pdf ) in 2013 one example that you can see on italaw.com thats relevant is [ achmea v. slovak republic ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) . 
  ( and the earlier case in 2008 ) a dutch insurance firm sued the slovak republic to block the single payer healthcare that the country voted for . 
  you 're wrong , [ gats ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) had quite a horrid effect here on healthcare availability and affordability , an effect which [ began 20 years ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9or5ecpe0de ) given that the us wants desperately to export this `` successful '' [ sarcasm / ] ( at making healthcare more - not less expensive ) model to other countries that have to trade with us , because of the size of our economy , the obama administration - and this is something the american people know not nor would we support - is doing its damnedests to * `` insure '' * that it will have much more , [ by means of tisa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) . 
  you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  where are you ? 
  thank god this is no longer common - at one time , some huge percentage of women died during childbirth . 
  do people know that the czar used to have a colony . . in california ? 
  how so ? 
  you did n't refute anything i said . 
  i was just trying to explain to you that the gats fta and others of its ilk ( like tisa , for example ) create a [ one way street to radical global services `` liberalisation '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) . 
  the ftas goal is `` liberating '' services from what they seem to be framing as the late 20th century 's unfair ( to corporations ) government oppression . 
  actually , the entire text of ceta was leaked recently . . 
  i am sure that a lot of info is in there . 
  but , speaking generally about these deals and how they frame everything , basically , politics is unpredictable . 
  investors need stability and thats more important than ** everything ** else , and whatever exceptions that might be made they can not be made on the basis of poverty or compassion . 
  compassion is bad . 
  they are irreversible , we know that , right . 
  we also know its secret . 
  we know that they frame any kind of giving people `` trade distorting subsidies '' like food or below market rate health care as bad , not only because its unfair to and a theft from corporate investors , literally taking food off the table of agribusiness executives , also because it makes poor people appear richer when they really should be poor to encourage the best of those people to become rich . 
  right ? 
  better to just sell the poor less for more , since there is less of it , and have them pay for it , so they have `` skin in the game '' . 
  also , countries have to never make any change that adversely effects corporate profits or access to a market . 
  so no more public services and the existing ones have to be dismantled too in many cases . 
  because they are a theft from corporate interests of those customers . 
  looks like you drank the kool aid my friend . . 
  sorry to burst your bubble . . 
  if you mean some kind of inferior healthcare of last resort that costs money , us trade policy has created a bunch of so called `` free trade agreements '' that *** tie our hands forever *** . 
  because of them . 
  they are the predecessors of ttip , ( the subject of this thread ) and tisa , the similarly pending but even more secret trade in services agreement . . ( see the line endorsing the `` standstill '' and `` ratchet '' concepts , [ at the link here ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-%2f%2fep%2f%2ftext%2bta%2bp7-ta-2013-0325%2b0%2bdoc%2bxml%2bv0%2f%2fen&amp;language=en ) . ), 
  in order for public to actually be allowed without a complete shift in trade policy , would be impossible . 
  because we 're dealing with something much like an extremist religious cult , like isis or the taliban . 
  by their behavior , i am - strange as it sounds , 100 % convinced at this point that they would sooner do almost anything else than allow real public health care . 
  and yes , they will and do lie quite willingly to cover this up . 
  both parties are , incredibly . 
  but , the facts are there to see in the literature - most of it , ( with one notable exception ) from outside the us . 
  standstill means that the date of signing was the forever immovable high water mark for public anything , thats 1995 . 
  ( perplexingly , tisa [ may also use 1995 as its standstill date ! ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2014/6/20/a_plan_only_banksters_will_love ) ) . . 
  ratchet means that every movement can only be more privatization , and there can be no movement away from privatization . 
  like a ratchet . 
  visualize a one way street with no side streets . 
  or a noose , or a fish trap . 
  the us could have had public healthcare * if it had predated the signing of the first applicable agreements * ( [ gats ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) and [ nafta ] ( http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/nafta.pdf ) - in 1995 - and it [ would need to have been delivered as part of the governments function , and completely free ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) so as not to compete unfairly with any multinational corporation . 
  that is [ the official us position ] ( http://www.maine.gov/legis/opla/ctpchlthcaresub.pdf ) . 
  for the actual text , see here under `` standstill '' . 
  http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/gats_03_e.htm#comm there is a [ very well written discussion of this issue here ] ( http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/putting_health_first.pdf ) . . 
  how should society be governed , then , in your opinion ? 
  but , the united states is ** still ** a government of by and for the people , at least on paper . 
  so it is ** no place for a system that tries to eliminate the core function of democracy which is to allow government of that society to evolve - which means that it always must retain its ability to change all laws and policies with the times . 
  ( an ability which is subverted by isds ) ** they should instead try to sell their ftas to north korea . 
  democracy - when its functioning , allows societies to evolve naturally . 
  legitimate governments are frameworks for the facilitation of change , gradual , peaceful , constructive , evolutionary change, 
  i do n't see any basis for your characterization as neoliberal `` values '' as `` pragmatic '' i see them as based on an agenda that depends on deceiving the public as to its true goals which are ultimately destructive and dare i say it , parasitic in that they take from society without giving back what is necessary to sustain society into the future . 
  the reason these ftas are being pushed , with their long list of power grabs and artificially contrived and inherently alien * corporation - `` rights '' * which limit * human * society 's ability to control its own destiny - is an act of desperation by a narrow segment of society - a segment that is becoming more and more isolated and arrogant . 
  ( hurting itself in the process , as well as others . ), 
  this power grab is undertaken as a larger and larger segment of society is beginning to be aware of what 's been happening and its ultimate destination if the neoliberal proponents of these antidemocratic `` values '' are left to take over and destroy democracy all around the world . 
  i think implicit in that agenda is a subconscious desire on the part of those who espouse the neoliberal agenda to be stopped . 
  because in the final analysis , its whats best for everybody . 
  even them . 
  their quality of life will improve along with everybody elses in a world where democracy is understood to be a core value . 
  neoliberals claim to be for a globalized society but the fact is they seek to divide and conquer .
