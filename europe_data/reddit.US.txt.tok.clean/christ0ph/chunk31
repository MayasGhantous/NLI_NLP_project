  ironically , the people they are seeking to exploit are finding common ground . 
  because giving is fundamentally a win-win situation . 
  so , the neoliberals would be wise to back off , then , the positive parts of their vision might come true on their own . 
  but on the whole planets terms , not theirs , which are as i said , unsustainable . 
  we should all focus on meeting the biggest challenges we 've ever faced which is navigating the social implications of the exponential growth in technology . . which can be thought of as humanity coming of age , humanity difficult adolescent years . . our transition into adulthood . . 
  which is at its core making this coming economic transition away from the need for everybody to work , to a society based on responsible abundance and the quest for knowledge , where humanity recognizes its responsibility as stewards of this planet not just for itself but for all the living things that live here . 
  do unto others as you would have them do unto you . 
  that 's the real recipe for survival and growth . 
  rising above greed is the recipe for species survival . 
  there are far better models than the ones which these ftas espouse . 
  righto . 
  `` nothing '' what i 'm saying is that the sound byte/wedge politics is what 's become the norm here . 
  and its not good . 
  the fact is , they will discount everything , and i do mean everything that does not lead to their desired outcome . 
  they will never engage on any kind of issue of substance . 
  its not their way . 
  that 's what things are like in america now . 
  that style of government is now arriving in europe , and elsewhere it seems so unless you want to be arguing with yourself forever , get used to it . 
  how did i make myself look like a fool ? 
  i do admit i am saying what i think , but i have a fairly high degree of faith in my own ability to get the core ideas that you and others like you are promoting and recognize them for what they are . 
  the websites did n't tell them what to mail in any more than web sites for a given candidate force people to vote for them , or ads for products force people to buy them . 
  is n't it obvious to you now that these structures were set up to implement a sort of non-democratic takeover of the last vestiges of real democracy and they refuse to engage in anything which does not lead to that agenda . 
  ( but of course if the public doesnt speak up they will implement it anyway ) so , basically you have an almost foolproof system , jeff . 
  is that why you get so angry when the problems with it get pointed out ? 
   i think that those processes , although they have a place , should not be used in a free trade agreement between states with a balanced and working judical system . 
  this seems to be the consensus more and more and those countries that are continuing to whip the dead horse of isds seem really out of step with the times . 
  it appears the european commissioner expressed the opinion that a great number of the submissions were invalidated because they used an online guide to the questions which explained many of the concepts . . ( quite well , i thought . ), 
  here is the story : ** [ did you take action on isds ?

  i think somebody would have to be a real fool to think that the ec was actually listening after reading this . 
  ** [ eu-canada trade deal leak ` ridicules ' ttip consultation , campaigners say ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/science-policymaking/eu-canada-trade-deal-leak-ridicules-ttip-consultation-307797 ) ** here in the us * there have not even been fake `` consultations '' . 
  * they are terrified of any actual citizen input . 
  just as they were with the fake `` healthcare reform '' in 2009 . 
  so the media seems to have a blanket ban on any kind of real coverage . 
  stories here on reddit also get deleted pretty consistently , on various pretexts . 
  this is so true . 
  there is a lot to be said for avoiding structures so complicated that legislators can not possibly have the time to understand them . 
  that is asking for trouble . 
  does this ? 
   * '' there 's not much point asking the public , most of them are uneducated morons that do n't have much of relevance to say .

  would n't you be much happier in an authoritarian dictatorship ? 
  in your opinion , jeff , what kinds of public decisions do people ( or `` uneducated morons '' , as you put it ) have a *** right *** to participate in ? 
  are there any ? 
  is this what you mean ? 
  * `` fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power .

  isds is a form of intimidation directed against lawmakers , because if they change anything , they never know when their country will be sued for millions or billions if they make a change that adversely effects some company . 
  isds seems to me to meet the us definition of terrorism , for that reason . 
  the chilling effect is what happens . 
  most `` cases '' are never even brought . 
  what happens is that a country becomes unable to adjust to changing situations , it becomes enslaved , or shall we say , `` beheaded '' , by isds which is intended to terrorize public servants . 
  i am not a fan of revolutions . 
  more often than not they are manipulations of the public by the same cynical people they are revolting against . 
  does finland have a large private education sector ? 
  gats allows public services that are not competing with private industry . 
  as long as finland keeps their education system free of private schools , they can avoid [ gats one way street to privatization ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) . 
  that also explains why canada still has their public healthcare but the uk may soon not . 
  read [ putting health first ] ( http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/putting_health_first.pdf ) for more on that . 
  its only when a market segment has been privatized in small part that the ftas tear public services apart and privatize a country . 
  so , avoid any private schools and finland 's public education system will remain safe . 
  once there are private schools , then they need to be protected forever from government monopolies , says gats , etc. 
  people in the us strongly want public healthcare , because only 14 % or more probably , less can afford the current system which has not seen any reform at all as promised in 2008 . 
  tricky wording in polls and armies of astroturfers on blogs such as this one have been used to attempt to give the impression that there is consent when in fact there is not to the coercive neoliberal agenda . 
  that 's what i think is in store for europe as well . 
  i would advise against these agreements - other countries do n't want to end up in our situation . 
  in 20 years , we wont have the middle class that we do now due to automation . 
  there needs to be much more recognition of and preparation for that future . 
  we should be strengthening the safety net , not dismembering it . 
  whats with all the foul language ? 
  well , you know , [ gats compels privatization ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) education is a large industry and its valuable for a country to have such a large body of jobs that they can use for leverage in trade negotiations . 
  in some cases hundreds of thousands of jobs . 
  i think thats how they see it . 
  sort of as bait . 
  i would agree with you in cases where there was a functioning democracy . 
  i do n't follow . 
  maybe this is clearer ? 
  [ the gats and south africa 's national health act : a cautionary tale . 
  ] ( http://www.hst.org.za/uploads/files/chap2_06.pdf ), 
  i think i 'm supporting the things i say fairly well . 
  this is one argument where i would n't mind being wrong . 
  many less literate americans would probably interpret that as meaning `` nafta put more people on welfare '' ( which in the us means public assistance programs ) its easy to mislead by using culture-specific language in polls . 
  its unfortunately quite inescapable that nafta did lead to a lot of american worker 's jobs , * as its commonly said here * , `` going south '', 
  the way the trade talks work they must include an explicit carve out to exempt a service . 
  ttip yes , but i suspect tisa will be the important one for a financial service like healthcare payment . 
  well , thanks to these ftas , we can look forward to the [ demise of public education ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) which will mean a global return to illiteracy and innumeracy . 
  i hope you 'll be proud of yourself for your contribution to the decline of civilization .

  exponential growth in technology is driving large increases in the use of every conceivable form of labor saving technology - and rapid increases in productivity . 
  which leads to less demand . 
  that is also causing falling labor costs , all of which is making many businesses far more profitable and this is all causing a global concentration of wealth . 
  [ 92 % of the time ec spent in meetings for ttip ] ( http://ttip2014.eu/files/content/docs/images/ttip-eu-komission-infografiken_englisch_722px_3_0.jpg ) was with lobbyists . 
  only 4 % was with representatives of the public .
