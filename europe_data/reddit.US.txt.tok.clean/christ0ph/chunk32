  its even worse in the us , it seems . 
  regardless , i am telling you , ** the fta-isds entitlements are private and they are enforced by private courts that sit above countries , so a revolution in a country , or an election or whatever , even a plague that killed off everybody , is n't going to effect their obligations one bit . 
  it would n't matter , ftas anticipate revolutions and they are designed to survive them . 
  a revolution , election , etc , is n't going to affect the fta - obligations one bit . 
  look at [ south africa ] ( https://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/gats-and-south-africas-national-health-act ) . 
  their revolution made not one bit of difference to their gats obligations . 
  what would be the point of putting all this effort into these things if an election or revolution or something political could reverse them ? 
  only if they try to change something that affects a corporation adversely . 
  politicians have to do things , at least every few years , from time to time , they ca n't get away with pretending to be in gridlock 100 % of the time - all isds means is that all those things have to effect all corporations in a positive manner . 
  whet you do to the people does n't matter to the system . 
  just make sure its always good for the corporations . 
  are you a corporation ? 
  if you are not a multinational corporation whose business has been adversely affected by some legislation in a country your country is engaged in a fta with , you do n't exist to the isds system . 
  on the other hand , if you are a health insurance company who had your market expropriated by a country that passed a single payer bill , because their people could not afford for profit health insurance , then isds is for you . 
  sue . 
   * `` i can sue anyone for anything '' *, 
  but its my understanding that many lobbyists - probably thousands , are involved in these ftas , while none of the public are . 
  you think that is okay ? 
  i do n't . 
  i can live with everybody knowing the contents of it as its being worked out the whole way , yes . 
  i would like to see that , its far preferable to what we have now . 
   * `` one way that this is important is the way it sidesteps the power of the public and the media , because without extended debate over a long period of time , neither can get up any momentum to challenge a proposal . 
  '' * thats the whole idea . 
  they have been doing that here in the us for a long time , now i guess the eu 's oligarchs want in on the action . 
  well , you should know that to the moderators of / r/politics , virtually everything having to do with free trade agreements `` is a european issue '' . 
  generally , it seems as if there are people going around reddit trying to find an excuse to delete stories about ftas, 
  isds `` investor-state dispute settlement '' ttip ( or tafta ) '' [ transatlantic trade and investment partnership ] ( http://ttip2014.eu ) '' or `` us-eu trade deal '' or whatever . 
  gats `` general agreement on trade in services '' ( wto ) ustr united states trade representative, 
  i think the ttip in its present form is an attack by the worst on all society , not just the people of north america and the european union . 
  for the benefit of other readers , that list seems to be explaining all the hidden things that these three secret ftas , and their predecessors that are already in force try to covertly do - ( in the case of gats - have already done , at least in the usa , a fact which 99 % of americans do n't know ) and it attempts to call them out and nullify them explicitly . 
  ** it would give the two us parties a way out of their cover up without a big embarrassing scandal . 
  ** of course , then suddenly some huge debt would materialize making any actual change impossible . 
  are we figuring it out yet ? 
  why did they try to harmonize downward when any idiot can see that the us has been dysfunctional as far as the regulation of many chemicals since the 1980s . 
  a responsible response to that would be to push for something that worked that improved the health of everybody , not dumped policies that appear to me to be prudent . 
  well , we all are voting no . 
  isds brings out the worst in everybody . 
  australians are n't exactly happy about isds either , you know . 
  do you care ? 
  why do n't you ask ten randomly selected americans what they think of it . 
  i guarantee you will get a blank stare every time . 
  when i tell people about isds , they think i am lying because they ca n't believe that our government would sell the people out in such a sordid manner . 
  that 's the way that they do this , by lying . 
  they dont have any approval of anybody . 
  obama ran as a liberal , he was elected under false pretenses . 
  he has no mandate to do this stuff . 
  none . 
  and they were right . 
  nafta was a turning point here in north america , and not in a good way . 
  isds is literally an attempt to destroy the ability of governments to govern democratically . 
  these negotiations involve hundreds or thousands of lobbyists on a massive level but , at the same time , people and citizen groups are being completely ignored . 
  in the us , its even worse than in europe . 
  the tiny amount of time spent with ngos concerns is just for appearances sake . 
  they could n't care less what the people think . 
  actions speak louder than words . 
  isds changes the whole game and literally poisons it - the intentional effect of that is to literally poison good government . 
  they keep things like isds secret in the us for a reason , jeff . 
  not if they actually have any power to do anything . 
  the eu is becoming like the us in bad ways . 
  let me just leave it at that . 
  i agree , its easy to blame it all on the us , but the fact is , the people who try to pass these things might as well all be from mars for all they care about the rest of us . 
  they have thinly veiled contempt for the common people . 
  if they want trust , let them ditch isds and all of its ilk to show that they mean it . 
  start fresh . 
  because these deals are poisoned by bad policy . 
  really , we need a completely different approach . 
  for one thing , any harmonization needs to be up because endocriorine disruptors literally threaten the safety of all living things . 
  see http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/tag/endocrine-disruptors/ and http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/index.cfm the nerve they have to try this . 
  if they cant act responsibly about chemicals and other issues of global importance , and deal with the fact that in the us , there is a 20 year backlog of dangerous chemicals - many that have yet to be regulated . 
  if they ca n't be responsible , they do n't deserve to be in office . 
  or anywhere near it . 
  period . 
  completely different area . 
  completely irrelevant . 
  isds is unconstitutional and antidemocratic . 
  its wrong . 
  its dishonest . 
  its evil . 
  sorry , that 's just idiotic . 
  also , on obama 's past . . he is a person who has built a career out of [ selling out poor , powerless people ] ( https://bigham.wordpress.com/2014/04/03/the-late-robert-fitch-on-obama-the-change-they-believe-in/ ) . 
  hos trade policy is identical to bush 's - which was very bad . 
  i think that isds creates such a huge prize for corporations , if they can get - just for one term - enough corrupt politicians into office to pass one of these ftas , and lock in their ill gotten gains forever . 
  isds , standstill and the like creates what i would call a *** criminogenic *** environment . 
  that 's not good . 
  the idea of giving corporations entitlements to regulatory conditions that existed at the treaty 's signing is insane because it gives some insignificant industry control over policy for an entire country . 
  for example , in the us the entire country 's healthcare has been [ held hostage to gats for decades ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) , and its such an ugly secret that politicians of all kinds intentionally mislead the public on it . 
   * `` can we just block the ttip from happening at all please ? 
  '' * are you a lobbyist for a corporation ? 
  unfortunately , people 's needs apparently [ are n't being considered ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/lobbying%20ttip.html ) practically at all !, 
   * `` of the 560 lobby encounters that dg trade held to prepare the negotiations , 520 ( 92 % ) were with business lobbyists , while only 26 ( 4 % ) were with public interest groups . 
  so , for every encounter with a trade union or consumer group , there were 20 with companies and industry federations . 
   *** `` nobody , any where , ever , has called for a government to pre-approve ttip before they 've seen what 's in it . 
  '' *** well , ** what is `` fast track '' then ??? 
  ** it seems to me that that is exactly what fast track is !, 
  and they certainly make it * exceedingly difficult for us legislators to read these texts * too !, 
  so , prevent anything that will require any `` coverage '' as `` news '' , all news , and covertly spin these nets to limit democracy to nothing of substance in secret , is that the strategy ? 
  * it is when the `` proceeding '' means ending the exercising of caution !, 
  check this out ... * go to news.google.com . 
  type in ttip and you wo n't find a single article in the mainstream us media about it since july !, 
  links to critiques of the 2005 ftaa treaty ( which failed ) this was bush trade policy but obama 's seems to be very very similar as far as i can see . . http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/2005/divide_and_conquer.pdf https://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/competition-policy-wto-and-ftaa,
