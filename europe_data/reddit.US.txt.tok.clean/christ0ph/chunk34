  so , there would be just one country that would pretend to be several countries fighting perpetual wars with one another ( or terrorism ? ), 
  like orwell 's 1984 ? 
  or europe between the dark ages and the enlightenment ? 
  ( because all the royal families were related to one another/incestuous ) i could see that , especially since there are connections like gwb being former business partners with one of obls half brothers ( not a well known fact ! ), 
  the so called `` tea party '' was/is fake , its a creation of a pr firm that specializes in fake astroturf groups !, 
  i think executivemonkey is right in that the jobs which the working people of the whole world depend on to survive are going away really quickly , and the discussion that needs to happen about what the world will do is being suppressed . 
  i might disagree with his chronology on minor points but the gist of what he says is right . 
  with the exception that the increasingly privatized militaries will also use robots so there wont be much of a need for people there either . 
  except as the victims of military attacks . 
  to fill quotas . 
  the vibe i get from you is that your coworkers vote ukip as a way of saying no but have they ever considered that the powers that be are way ahead of them and are probably manipulating them to do exactly that . 
  because of course , positions can all be figured out by computer and the electorate sliced and diced by wedge issues . 
  thats what they do here in america . 
  do n't let them privatize the nhs . 
  here in the us , the forced privatization of healthcare is costing each american ( from what i can tell ) around $ 300,000 more than an identically situated canadian for health insurance and ( potentially huge ) out of pocket costs . 
  the amount of extra , additional money thats spent involuntarily on the for profit system is difficult to calculate because it requires knowing the healthcare inflation rate since 2000 which is debatable , but it is at least $ 250000 - $ 300000 over their lifetime , in today 's money , probably more , and for that most americans get increasingly abysmal , abbreviated health care . 
  i do n't think that one set of officials - one administration , one congress , should be able to bind the country forever into anything . 
  thats what is so odious about isds . 
  what that means is that one corrupt administration can basically sell a country out forever . 
  bluntly , its too easy to pretend you are something you are not and , with backing in high places , get selected . 
  i think we all see that now . 
  i 've read the jobs study . . ` leaked documents '' is too vague , there have been dozens of leaked documents it seems for each of the ftas . 
  but if you mean the jobs study , the gist of what i thought is that there was nothing there arguing for the thing that i could see . 
  it reminded me of obama trying to sell us obamacare by telling us that * the rate of increase * in healthcare costs would be reduced by two percent , over ten years . 
  when you consider what they seem to be trying to take away , for example , turning public healthcare to private , that could mean the euro equivalent of hundreds or thousands of dollars a month to families . 
  keep that in mind . 
  you bring up an important point , one not many americans realize yet , but our job market is shifting for good , its not temporary , and its shifting in a way which is going to mean unemployment for a lot of people is going to be the norm . 
  this is not the time to be getting rid of the safety net , this is the time to be improving it . 
  ive personally seen two - not one , two , europeans turn around and take their families , go back to europe , when confronted with the `` best '' healthcare the us had to offer and a sick family member . 
  and i really mean the best . 
  as far as i can tell . 
  that should tell us something . 
  they tell us its the best , but it is n't , it could be a lot better . 
  usually , yes . 
  but when they are bad , thanks to isds , now , they can get really bad . 
  i agree with you - for every bad corporation there are at least fourty or fifty small and medium sized companies that are incorporated , that treat their employees and customers well , that are just business people trying to do whatever they do * and that does n't typically include evildoing . 
  *  * `` corporations are not all investment banks ( and actually , until the last few decades , they were mainly partnerships ) . 
  non-profits are often corporations . 
  many small businesses are organized as a corporation . 
  hell , i am 1/3 owner of a corporation and i certainly am not anywhere near the wealthy class of people . 
  most corporations are not on wall street or even have publicly traded shares . 
  most corporations are closely held and owned by the main employee . 
  actually , i would say that ( gasp ) most corporations are not evil . 
  ( most corporations are n't that big ! ), 
  its just a few ( relative to the millions who are n't ) big corporations who really are evil - and they loom large in the public eye , for good reason , because they create an atmopshere of criminal privilege which poisons democracy , and they heavily impact society . 
  are n't these things irreversible , jeff ? 
  also , `` provisional '' approval of these ftas is still very scary , as shown by https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140801/05242228082/corporate-sovereignty-tribunal-makes-50-billion-award-against-russia.shtml, 
  what is a `` nonbiased '' source , to you ? 
  just one that agrees with you ? 
  if by theocracy you mean `` influence of fundamentalist christians '' they are n't as influential as they used to be . 
  what 's happened is the inside the beltway crowd are more corporate beholden now than they ever have been before . 
  many multinationals are american in name only now . 
  they certainly are n't almost ever held accountable to america or americans for the things they do . 
  i 'm surprised that somebody downvoted me because it seems indisputable . 
  they are renowned for being intentionally written to be so abstruse and ambiguous , as to be impossible for laypeople and even many law practitioners to understand . 
   their influence is considerably less than most people think . 
  thats simply not true . 
  their influence is huge , as shown by the woeful state of healthcare affordability in the us and the fact that the us drug and insurance companies are not trying to impose their '' [ successful model ] ( http://www.commonwealthfund.org/news/news-releases/2011/sep/us-ranks-last-on-preventable-deaths.aspx ) '' [ / sarcasm ] on other nations . 
  it means that dishonesty has become the norm . 
  i am just explaining what people were told . 
  they had no choice , the us elections are winner take all . 
  once obama had won the primaries ( with the help of hundreds of thousands of gop crossover voters ) he had as good as won the election . 
   * `` if you thought obama was a left-leaning liberal after he spent 10 years teaching at u chicago , i think that you only have one person to blame : yourself . 
  '' * lots of americans are working two or three jobs to make ends meet . 
  they have no time to investigate candidates early in the election . 
  and of course , the biggest reason was race , many , many , many americans just assumed that since obama was half black , he would be progressive . 
  that was a fatal mistake . 
  who do you , presumably a neoliberal , feel best explains the cause ? 
  there have been tons of leaks and the contents of all of them has been enough to illustrate that they are literally laundry lists of bad ideas , which politicians could not pass unless they were literally hidden from the public . 
  which is what they are trying to do . 
  read this : [ ttip : eu commissioner points finger at us secrecy , investor-state provisions ] ( http://www.ip-watch.org/2014/04/02/ttip-eu-commissioner-points-finger-at-us-secrecy-investor-state-provisions/ ), 
  you better beleive the public cares about this issue , when they get the chance to hear about it . 
  however , as i said , its never , ever discussed honestly in the us media . 
  thank you , i will read the paper , i 've bookmarked it in my must read list . 
  no , sorry , jeff , thats the facts . 
  the companies that push the hardest for the ftas here in the us are the banks , the drug companies , the agribusiness giants , the hollywood studios . . 
  isds , [ standstill ] ( http://www1.oecd.org/daf/mai/pdf/dg2/dg2953r1e.pdf ) , and ratchet , certainly are n't reformable . 
  cheap labor anywhere wont make a difference in the long run because the end state is a state of fairly complete automation . 
  at least thats what i suspect . 
  also , in businesses where cheap skilled labor is needed , it may be more economical to use telepresence - people on the other side of the planet , working over a fast network hookup . 
  many people are doing that in medicine . 
  i think that they see the middle class as doomed by the exponential growth in technology . 
  they want to get rid of things like european social programs while people still think they might somehow become rich in the future . 
  as soon as they are done for , then the gloves come off . 
  americans dont know about this stuff , there will be better deals in the future . 
  it is n't obama 's way or the highway . 
  obama is mistrusted now by both the left and the right . 
  there are people who almost certainly are paid to stir up division between the parties . 
  they go around dissing one party or the other , trying to conceal the fact that its the politicians who are doing this , and party has less to do with it than membership in some insiders washington/wall street/london/brussels axis . 
  eu corporations are doing the same things , they just are using america as their heavy . 
  we 're all in the same boat , the eu corps just are a little more sophisticated in how they hide their attempts to turn both europe and the us into a mono-culture of corporate dominated inequality . 
  chemical safety : [ ciel : chemical industry secretly manipulating us-eu trade negotiations ] ( http://www.ciel.org/chem/ttip_10mar2014.html ) http://www.ciel.org/publications/toxicpartnership_mar2014.pdf http://www.citizen.org/documents/7-10-14-letter-tafta-and-chemicals.pdf http://libcloud.s3.amazonaws.com/93/c7/2/3299/ciel_submission_on_ttip_sentate_finance_committee_hearing-clean.pdf, 
  according to [ this report on nafta at 20 ] ( http://www.citizen.org/documents/nafta-at-20.pdf ) , more than one million job losses can be attributed to nafta . 
   `` some sectors will grow and others will shrink '' ftas do not create jobs . 
  they keep saying that but the data does not back it up . 
  yes , you are right but if you talk to most americans they have no idea that this agenda is implicit in the neoliberal obama administration 's trade policy . 
  they dont even know the smallest thing about trade policy or that `` blowback '' from it now rules many aspects of domestic policy . 
  for example , healthcare policy . 
  the price of rx drugs in the us has soared since obama was elected .
