  the obama administration has forced truly bad policy on the country under the guise of `` healthcare reform '' that attempts to advance a neoliberal agenda and shred the last remaining pieces of public health care in a covert-aggressive manner . 
  the us has seen a net loss of jobs due to nafta . 
  somebody who advances unproven `` honesty theories '' . 
  i 'm interested in your positions but you are ignoring the core message i am trying to share with you , which is that with these ftas , there are core constructs which are really quite bad which have to go . 
  like isds . 
  the fact that people did not know about isds previously should not be used to justify its continued promotion . 
  we are seeing isds is being used for lawsuits against countries leaders for merely fulfilling their responsibilities to their people . 
  corporate profits are not more important than people 's rights to govern and their health and well being . 
  the current administration are fundamentally identical to the previous one on trade , which to say they are taking an extreme one that does not at all reflect american values . 
  the obama administration , however , is in one way worse than the previous administration in that it tries to portray itself as being for affordable healthcare , etc. 
  even as it covertly works in these hidden trade negotiations to make it more expensive . 
  your own australian health association recently came out against tpp , did you know that ? 
  ( there is an article about it on the bilaterals.org site you can find it by searching under either australia or medicines ), 
  tisa ignores the fact that the 2008 global economic crisis happened because of deregulation . 
  it tries to force much more of it . 
  tisa is the one that attempts to effect services the most . 
  so , its easy to say ttip wont impact services , if you pretend that tisa doesnt exist . 
  *** tisa , *** ** is the fta that is supposed to impact services . 
  ** they can and do it seems , happily say *** ttip *** wont , even as they are almost certainly negotiating in secret to use tisa to dismantle them . 
  this is how they have been shown to operate here in the usa . 
  google for the exchange between the maine citizens trade commission and the ustr over gats and dirigo health , the state-based healthcare provider that maine had to give up because it was unable to do what it needed to do to lower costs , because of gats . 
  then look at the misleading campaign in vermont for what they call `` single payer '' but which is actually a big nothing , which seems to ignore the fact that real single payer in the us is made impossible by gats . 
  as other jobs vanish , healthcare begins to take on a very unhealthy aspect where its increasingly looked to as a cash cow which can be milked for revenue . 
  that goal is inherently in conflict with healthcare affordability . 
  the legislators in the us on both sides of the aisle are complicit in their silence about gats . 
  they all are trying to hide its implications . 
  all seem to be joining in trying to hide the very real and ugly fact that gats and now these additional new pending ftas bend over backwards to block every single thing that could make healthcare affordable in the us . 
  the loss of public healthcare due to standstill and ratchet is a loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars per american over our lifetimes . 
  and the increase in the price of rx drugs has been substantial , in many cases 200 % or more in the past six years . 
  the cost to some families is thousands of dollars a month . 
  are they the `` winners '' you are describing ? 
  it does n't benefit americans , it may benefit some big corporations , but they arguably often are hardly `` american '' we are just their `` hosts '' for the time being , it seems . 
  ** btw , now many us corporations now seem eager to become european or canadian . 
  they claim that its due to `` high us taxes '' ( !!! ), 
  but in reality of course its due to isds then giving them the ability to sue the us government for any changes that adversely affect their profits !, 
  ** that carte blanche is a recipe for fraud . 
  that then becomes `` changing the rules in the middle of the game '' as the neoliberals put it . 
  the us could easily end up like the slovak republic , [ being sued under isds by an insurance company ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) ( for passing a bill to switch to a single payer health care plan ) . 
  see also : [ arbitrators dismiss claims by dutch insurer , but investor says it has achieved goal of averting slovak nationalization and creation of single-payer health system ] ( http://www.iareporter.com/articles/20140523_3 ) and [ slovakia prevails in investment treaty claim concerning universal health coverage ] ( http://www.oneillinstitutetradeblog.org/slovakia-prevails-investment-treaty-claim-concerning-universal-health-coverage/ ) and numerous articles on : http://spectator.sme.sk/ ( search on the phrases achmea or eureko ), 
   becuause of what happened 6 years ago , i am kind of skeptical about the benefits of market deregulation . 
  what do you think about tisa ? 
   in any case , i think an agreement of such importance should be voted on referendum . 
  yes , of course . 
  no referendum , no legitimacy . 
  so , by your logic , then , nobody should even discuss it ? 
  i dont think so . 
  `` trust us , we 're experts '' does n't fly after all these betrayals . 
  to hell with it . 
  you 're so smart . 
  the point i was trying to make is that now with the revolving door , there is no accountability for politicians . 
  they get elected , sell out and then [ go to work advising the businesses they used to regulate in how to evade regulation ] ( http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/dalbo/regulatory_capture_published.pdf ) . 
  they they become political appointees . 
  in the past , there was accountability , now , none . 
  there is a consensus here in the us that nafta led to a huge loss of jobs . 
  its not just epi . 
  the existence of isds was hidden from the public globally and we all have only recently become aware of it . 
  thanks to a deliberate , global pattern of deceit . 
  make the thread about simplistic , binary `` thought banishing cliches '' as robert j. lifton would say . 
  where is the honesty ? 
  honesty theorists like yourself need to show us some actual honesty . 
  i think you 're trying to distract attention from the very real issues with the core concepts in these ftas and the fact that they indeed are written to make it easier for big corporations to get changes which they could never get in the light of day . 
  no , but they dont realize that their membership in gats already subjects them to the gats-driven forced privatization of their nhs the minute they privatized it even the smallest bit . 
  see [ putting health first ] ( http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/putting_health_first.pdf ) americans do n't realize it either . 
  people here still think medicare for all or single payer in the individual states is possible , [ despite the fact that gats bars them ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) . 
  ** the ugly truth , that both parties betrayed the country and then colluded and continue to hide it , is just too hard a fact for most of us to live with . 
  ** so people 's minds just reject it . 
  i was trying to explain why jobs are vanishing - its because the us is n't investing in the future . 
  in short , they are vanishing everywhere . 
  as long as it contains isds , standstill , or ratchet , or tries to lower the precautionary principle , or is secret , i am against it . 
  americans have never heard of ttip . 
  most of us ( 99.99 % ) have no idea ttip , tisa or tpp even exist , and are being negotiated . 
  we certainly are not going to `` win '' anything from ttip . 
  it is solely for big corporations . 
  us ngos for the most part do n't even know about these things . 
  the us media doesnt cover them at all . 
  if they did they would be angry about them . 
  i am trying to support good policy for all of us . 
  i am against ttip as it is now . 
  i reject the zero sum game concept . 
  we can all `` win '' trade . 
  that 's what trade should be . 
  mutually beneficial . 
  note that people in this thread who are saying the us gained jobs because of nafta are lying , the us lost 700,000 jobs due to nafta . 
  ** [ u.s. economy lost nearly 700,000 jobs because of nafta , epi says ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/12/nafta-job-loss-trade-deficit-epi_n_859983.html ) **, 
  dirty south made a shameless deliberate ** mis ** - representation ** [ u.s. economy lost nearly 700,000 jobs because of nafta , epi says ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/12/nafta-job-loss-trade-deficit-epi_n_859983.html ) **,

  he has it backwards , 700,000 jobs were lost . 
  lots of american states are in the process of collapse too * because of nafta . 
  i am the op , i am american , and i am against ttip in its current form . 
  ( isds and the lowering of standards and dozens of other issues make me so ) i would support some future treaty - if first we had a completely transparent process , and if we started from scratch eliminating isds and all the standstill , ratchet , etc. 
  and used the precautionary principle to determine policy globally . 
  the us has not been keeping up with urgent needs to regulate , because all the government agencies which do so have been under continuous attack for more than 20 years . 
  here are some good articles from an american agricultural group that represents a saner approach to all this . 
  http://www.iatp.org/blog/201405/no-green-jobs-for-you-secret-eu-us-trade-agreement-threatens-minnesota%e2%80%99s-solar-rebate-an http://www.iatp.org/documents/10-reasons-ttip-is-bad-for-good-food-and-farming http://www.iatp.org/blog/201310/secret-trade-agenda-threatens-shift-toward-sustainable-food-system-0 http://www.iatp.org/documents/trading-away-localization-in-ttip, 
  there is no `` better paying job '' ahead for the millions of americans who only have a high school or two year college education because the cost of college makes it increasingly impossible for american families to afford . 
  shhhh !, 
  us agribusiness interests are very powerful and indeed , they want to prevent regulation of endocrine disruptors , etc. 
  they feel very threatened by the precautionary principle and the vision of a safer world it represents . 
  ** if they want any kind of agreement , the us should rise to the eu level , not the other way around . 
  the whole idea of consolidation is to allow them to cut jobs .
