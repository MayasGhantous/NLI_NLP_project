   yes , i would say that most of the population do n't know what they 're talking about with respect to the ttip , and just base their opposition to it off of fear-generating headlines and so on what `` headlines '' ? 
  ** if you look at the media here in the us there has not been a single story in the mainstream media about ttip since july . 
  ** they lie , people die . 
  ** he 's trying to use the argument they use here in the us . 
  ** *** they keep all stories about these ftas out of the media and then they accuse people like me of making it all up . 
  seriously , i deal with that every day here . 
  *** if the people here ever figure this out , they are going to be very sorry they lied so shamelessly . 
  you europeans , please , remember this fact . 
  the place to start is inform americans they are doing ths < because we do n't even know these things are happening . 
  that 's why they keep it so secret . 
  i am american and i am arguing against the ttip . 
  they are trying to say the armies of lobbyists and their trade negotiators and politicians represent us , but they do n't . 
  ** what we are seeing in the us is a scheme to destroy democracy by eliminating all the good things that governments can do , silently , with isds and ftas , leaving them only able to do bad things . 
  ** ** obama got elected on false pretenses . 
  he pretended to be a left-leaning liberal when in fact he was a chicago school neoliberal . 
  ** the 2008 election must have presented a huge challenge to tptb because it was clearly going to give `` a democrat '' a mandate to make big changes especially in healthcare payment and drug costs , foreign policy and financial reform . 
  obama has skillfully hijacked all three areas and left us worse off or at best , in essentially the same place we were under bush . 
  most americans now have some realization that he is not what he claimed to be , but they lack the definition because we americans have been isolated from any knowledge of neoliberalism by our media which has deliberately blocked stories which might inform people . 
  that has effectively turned the entire country into angry people who have no idea of why things are the way they are . 
  this is to prevent any kind of political awakening here . 
  do n't you think the word `` honesty theorist '' is more appropriate for people like you who persistently argue against the obvious facts ? 
  the devil is in the details and they can not be changed . 
  look at the recent $ 50b award against russia to a bunch of oligarchs . 
  the thing they do n't tell you is that was a [ `` provisional application '' ] ( http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/international-migration/glossary/provisional-application/ ) of an unratified treaty . 
  these things are filled with little details that make it so any involvement at all is a trap . 
  even if just one of the three similarly named ftas passes , the drafters have made it so we americans are screwed . 
  they are trying to build on gats to really eliminate public healthcare . 
  look at the poor brits , having this debate , they do n't even realize that their country and nhs , already bound by gats , which was signed 20 years ago , is already trapped . 
  [ like us in the us ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) . 
  nobody has told them , or us in the us , either . 
  they are world class liars , these politicians . 
  but at least under monarchy you knew who to blame . 
  there was accountability . 
  people whose money is their `` free '' speech and can not be limited . 
  the medium income in the us is falling due to automation . 
  you do n't want to follow our path . 
  the us is pretending that prosperity is right around the corner and ignoring the need for more education implicit in our exponential growth in technology . 
  not a single politician here acknowledges that barring big changes in our national priorities to invest in sustainable growth , 75 % of americans jobs are going away , soon . 
  their `` solution '' is to try to mandate the one way privatization of everything so currently public teaching and healthcare jobs can become bargaining chips in their globalization game . 
  germany 's approach which invests more in education and health , is far better . 
  you ca n't eat military hardware . 
  built on people can mean many things . 
  in some cases they are built on the exploitation of poor people by powers that be , something which has recently been identified as `` regulatory capture '' and `` control fraud '' . 
  why ca n't the whole world have honest government ? 
  because the multinationals wont allow it ? 
  that is what ttip tpp and the worst of them all , tisa , by means of the insanely broken isds are saying . 
  they are trying to silently kill democracy and putting just a few narrow , deep pocketed corporate interests above the interests of everybody else . 
  they lie , people die . 
  then why does n't the ttip try to raise labor and consumer/health/chemical standards rather than try to lower them to the lowest common denominator ? 
  they are taking advantage of the rampant corruption in the us and trying to export our corruption to the rest of the world . 
  food safety : http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm http://iatp.org/documents/leaked-document-reveals-us-eu-trade-agreement-threatens-public-health-food-safety http://www.iatp.org/documents/10-reasons-ttip-is-bad-for-good-food-and-farming, 
  [ this link is a website ] ( http://ttip2014.eu ) run by members of the european parliament who are against the ttip in its present form due to its giving of irreversible entitlements to corporate interests . 
  the european commission is pretending to listen to public opinion but the recent leak of the ceta shows that they are ignoring the public opinion as badly as the us government ( which is basically trying to hide the very existence of the ttip from the american public . ), 
  in my opinion , both `` governments '' are acting as if they were in thrall to deep pocketed corporate interests and were pointedly ignoring the public interest . 
  what is it then ? 
  ive heard statements to this effect a lot but they might be exaggerations . 
  still , there must be some truth to it . 
  nothing to say about what 's being hyped as the biggest trade deal ever ? 
  the eu media is full of stuff about it , why not the us ? 
  the last article on ttip in the ny times was in july . 
  wedge issue politics, 
  the us is being marketed as sort of like a mexico to eu countries . 
  low environmental standards , low wages , no unions . 
  global warming , so just wait a few years . 
  what do you think about the recent outcry in australia about tpp ? 
  laugh . 
  just laugh at them if they try that stuff . 
  how could they ? 
  in switzerland a cup of coffee costs $ 12, 
  just a few inches off at the top . . 
  they never had a vote on ttip . 
  saying they had a vote is like saying americans decide their president . 
  it sounds nice but its factually wrong . 
  just relax , `` do n't worry , be happy '' not, 
  would n't they be seen as vindicated now in the formerly occupied republics ? 
  soviet as in  20 years ago ? 
  last month there was a $ 50 billion award ( the biggest ever ) in an isds case brought against the russian government for breaking a 1990s energy treaty which had not even been ratified by the duma . 
  it was brought by several already extremely wealthy expat russian oligarchs . 
  they won . 
  the russian government is appealing it . 
  is a huge amount of money . 
  it strikes me as quite bizarre because russia had not even ratified the treaty . 
  they had no vote , so they tried to vote, 
  here in the us the media ( 90 % controlled by only 5 corporations ) seems to have an agreement to print * absolutely nothing * about them . 
  the us government is just obsessing to keep them quiet . 
  its because people would just go nuts if they realized what 's in them . 
  so many bad things . 
  its even worse in the us , the level of disconnect between commonly held beliefs and [ the truth on these ftas ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) is staggering . 
  for example , they are why health care in the us is such a bad deal . 
  the ftas are forcing us to get the worst deal of all . 
  the ttip and the other ftas seem to refer back to the generic gats rules on public services privatization . 
  see http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm . 
  no , it would be public universities ( and other public services ) which would not be allowed , because they `` unfairly compete '' with multinational corporate firms . 
  when a country makes a decision to privatize any part of a public service , its basically deciding to privatize that market segment completely . 
  thats why canada , despute having signed gats in the 1990s , wisely kept health care completely free , unlike the uk which is privatizing it . 
  the same things apply to education . 
  see http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/putting_health_first.pdf for a discussion of the issues in health care . 
  gats is the reason health care in the us is so messed up . 
  thats true . 
  there is a [ good discussion of the gats rules on public services here ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) .
