  basically , ftas treat education like a commodity to be bought and sold , like corn or bauxite . 
  ftas and public services do n't mix . 
  you people are unbelievable too , but for different reasons . 
  your arguments are ludicrous . 
  where is this trust ? 
  gone with mai , and [ ftaa ] ( https://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/divide-and-conquer-ftaa-us-trade-strategy-and-public-services-americas ) . 
  here 's a good example of what i am talking about . 
  [ reid says obamacare just a step toward eventual single-payer system ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ), 
  nice try but no go . 
  look at the history with [ gats and public services ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) - trying to privatize health care and education . 
  no thank you . 
  no , there are dozens of things in the leaks which have emerged from the ftas that almost no americans would want to see happen . 
  the obama administration is trying to portray itself as progressive on the us news media but in these trade deals they are undermining their stated goals right and left . 
  the biggest problem is with health care - energy is a close second . 
  the ftas ban all new affordable health care modalities . 
  they lock the country into for profit health care with no opportunity of escape . 
  the american people can not afford the agenda they are pushing on both health care insurance services and drug pricing/patents/generics . 
  so its been largely hidden , going back to gats and nafta ( which had similar `` standstill '' and `` ratchet '' provisions ) ( here is [ an example ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) of the problems they cause in health care ) silently , expansion of public health care has been prohibited while the last three administrations worked overtime attempting to set up ftas which would - if the government did things which `` adversely effected '' them , would trigger massive compensation ( i.e. 
  isds ) to those special interests out of the taxpayers money . 
  [ tisa is just the latest ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) of a string of ftas ( two of which failed - mai and ftaa ) which attempt to block access to public services undemocratically . 
  americans have not been told this , even as the us trade negotiators are trying to nail this policy down in as many ways as they can . 
  thats not why the american people elected obama . 
  we did n't elect obama the neo-liberal , we were fooled into thinking he was a progressive by the fact that he 's half black . 
  nobody here in the us knew anything about his work for the real estate industry in chicago , he portrayed himself as a community activist . 
  also , their failure to regulate chemicals for the last 25 years combined with their secretive push to `` freeze '' chemical regulation is really a bad , bad idea . 
  [ us states demand more say in ttip negotiations ] ( http://www.bilaterals.org/?us-states-demand-more-say-in-ttip ), 
  i live in the us and we 've been kept in the dark about these ftas . 
  they do that because the stuff that is in them seriously , profoundly goes against our values . 
  very very good . 
  but should n't the european statue be blindfolded , i.e. 
  blind justice ? 
  we did . 
  what did we get ? 
  [ lies ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) . 
  how can agreements be binding even to the smallest degree upon nations that do n't have any say whatsoever in their writing , and oftentimes , as in the case of americans , know not even of their existence ? 
  the european disunion ? 
  the untied states ? 
  update : [ did you take action on isds ? 
  eu trade commissioner says you did n't . 
  : commission considering counting thousands of responses as `` one '' ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/consultation%20isds%20discount.html ), 
  but do ftas actually lead to more and not less trade ? 
  i think that point is debatable . 
  i ca n't help it if i have a good argument and you do n't . 
  i thought there were 600 + corporate lobbyists with access to the us team , and not a single ngo representative . 
  if that is n't `` special interests '' what is ? 
  thats not a good thing to assume under the circumstances . 
   i 'm not saying people should n't worry a little about the deal . 
  but i know a lot of the people have irrational fears without even knowing what 's in the deal . 
  how convenient . 
  looks like they planned this one out meticulously . 
    90 % of those comments will be because there have been a hype about the ` evil corporations and their plan for world dominion ' . 
  tell me something you think is `` good '' about it . 
  anything . 
  well , here is an example , ** slovakia voted for single payer health care ** , but look what they got , a huge lawsuit . 
  http://www.italaw.com/cases/417 http://www.italaw.com/cases/2564, 
  i hope not . 
  isds has to go . 
  it is just asking for trouble with all the corruption we have now . 
  these legislators are elected for four years to minimize the damage any one can do . 
  allowing them to override that is basically giving the country 's future away to crooks . 
  one bad administration can literally ruin a country 's economic future by selling it to corporations in exchange for some high paid job lobbying when they get out of office . 
   no , only the negotiating papers . 
  the actual ttip will have to be passed by each of the 28 national parliaments as well as in the eu , in which case it will be put before the public . 
   < i  `` i just wish people would wait until we actually know what 's in that deal . 
  '' < / i  is n't it supposed to be secret for five years ( after they sign it ??? ), 
  to be honest , i was really conflicted about keeping the title as it is , which i dont think is such a good title , but when i change titles to be more descriptive , on both of these particular issues , ( ttip and anything connected to single payer healthcare ) both of which seem to be getting censored a lot here , then i 'm much more likely to have the post `` moderated '' even if the title is not inaccurate at all . 
  even when i simply use a line from the story that describes it better , they get deleted saying `` edited title '' many of my posts seem to get downvoted by bots . 
  or something . 
  another problem is that even though ttip is a us/canada/mexico / eu trade deal , the moderators of some groups basically insist to me that it is an europe-only issue and delete almost all fta related posts as being `` not us politics related '' . 
  the us media is similarly avoiding covering these ftas - at all . 
  europeans should know that . 
  we 've also been lied to about healthcare to the point where americans dont even realize these ftas have been in place for decades and that they bar new public health care . 
  ( by means of standstill clauses and also by means of the investor-state `` rights to everything staying the same '' they give corporations . 
  does this work ? 
  new video url : try this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlo3ghj6fwm, 
  i can only play the audio myself on one of my machines . 
  let me see if another browser can fix it . 
  you should be able to , in this situation . 
  especially since 100 aids researchers were on that plane . 
  recently the government of slovakia was [ sued by a dutch insurer ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) for attempting to switch to single payer after the country had signed an fta . 
  people [ should also read this ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) . . it shows how real this threat is . 
  they do n't help the us . 
  the us media has had practically no stories about the ftas . . americans are almost completely unaware these things even exist . 
  there is a reason for that , we would disagree with them . 
  the people who are pushing these ftas are making shameless arguments as to their supposed `` benefits '' but those arguments are specious and should be seen for what they are , attempts to hide the truly ugly nature of these ftas - they do not help create jobs , more often then not they have resulted in net losses of jobs , and they are unconstitutional and undemocratic . 
  the cost to each american of their blockage of public healthcare in the us is astronomical . 
  hundreds of thousands of dollars per person . 
  http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2014/02/fact-checking-froman-the-top-10-myths-used-by-obamas-top-trade-official.html http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2014/04/tpp-foreign-policy-arguments-mimic-false-claims-made-for-past-pacts.html, 
  makes things easier for the ultra wealthy to have no competition for jobs from the poor . 
  ha - do a little comparison between the us and eu . 
  its shocking . 
  did you know that existing ftas are the reason us healthcare is so bad/expensive ? 
  you heard me , thats what you 'll pay more than if you lived in canada , for crappier health care . 
  maybe almost as much for higher energy prices too . 
  hope you 're saving your money . 
  so , you 've got an extra quarter to half million dollars to spend for crappier health care then , i see . 
  the `` sacrifice '' seems to be [ rather one sided ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) . 
  it makes public healthcare impossible by the death of a thousand cuts . . changes can only be towards increased `` liberalisation '' ( privatization ) never away from it , even if its unsuccessful . 
  look at [ achmea v. slovak republic ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) and the usa . 
  two perfect examples of ftas screwing a country out of affordable public healthcare .
