  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4oqeeksd6s ), 
  its a new kind of law and its bites bad . 
  look at the recent case of achmea the dutch insurer who stopped slovakia from having single payerl it was a standstill clause , just like the clauses in gats , etc. 
  i did n't realize you were making a simpson 's reference, 
  its not a random fact at all , it was an important fact that weighed fairly heavily in the international criticism of his regime that made it inevitable that he would fall . 
  i was watching cnn coverage of the revolution going on in romania with my friend adrian who was born and grew up in romania , and `` escaped '' ( by walking through the mountains at night ) . 
  it was crazy , seeing that on tv . 
  at one point , somebody , i think it was ted koppel , showed a video of this huge room , just one in a monstrous underground complex filled with extremely expensive audio recording equipment that they found in these tunnels , which crisscrossed the entire city . 
  they were all being used in mass surveillance . 
  this is while many people in romania were basically starving or on the verge of starving . 
  there you go , another random fact . 
  ceausescu 's `` securitate '' used hollow bullets which caused massive bleeding in people who were hit by them . 
  for not shooting them with live bullets , of course . 
  let me guess , he rules by fear and intimidation ? 
  he was in power for a long time , and during that time , romania 's people 's lives ** were stunted ** . 
  lots of people were blacklisted by the government from having good jobs , basically , the government , and policy , not people 's skills , decided everything . 
  that is what happens in dictatorships . 
  imagine if everybody in your country , ( whatever it is ) had to have a security clearance to get any good job . 
  [ see here ] ( http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=4f1e0899533f7680e78d03281fe18baf&amp;wit_id=4f1e0899533f7680e78d03281fe18baf-2-1 ) north koreans forced to work 16 hours a day and executed for making the slightest complaint . 
  read this about a message an oregon woman found in [ halloween decorations ] ( http://www.oregonlive.com/happy-valley/index.ssf/2012/12/halloween_decorations_carry_ha.html ) . 
  that must have been such an ordeal for the romanian people , having these creeps steal half of the whole country 's lives . 
  kind of like being gang raped by a government . 
  : o people were so poor they had one light bulb which they would bring from one room to another . 
  romanians had to reuse condoms . 
   * `` considering the future will revolve around the world wide web , it strikes me as odd why the us congress does n't capitalize on this creating adequate legislation to favor these companies through customer satisfaction , instead of antagonizing the customers selling it self out to powerful lobbies like hollywood or data gathering companies . 
  '' * you make an extremely good point . 
  i was just thinking the other day of the incredible wealth of new services which i and a great many other people would be really excited to help build if only i was n't so concerned about privacy in the current political atmosphere that i would be certain that they would be misused . 
  just as many people are naive and stupid about what can be done with new technology , many of my friends , who were among the first to enter this world of the web , and who know it as well as they know their own homes - perhaps more - are in one way or another * pulling back * from their use of digital services , even cell phones , out of anger or frustration . 
  what may eventually happen is a separating of the world into the closed areas and the open areas . 
  the open areas would protect and nurture the values of freedom and responsibility , and would become areas of knowledge abundance and eventually , economic power and wisdom , and the closed areas would nourish the values of fear and paranoia , as well as false manufactured scarcity , secure in their knowledge that the dangerous creative energy of the open areas would not penetrate to disturb their hegemony , their poor [ growing ever poorer , and their rich growing ever richer ] ( http://ideas.repec.org/p/iza/izadps/dp1938.html ) . 
  and it would n't . 
  like a tree , it would route itself around the stunted growth areas , growing towards the light . 
  i think that the turkish government is probably worse than many americans realize . 
  but , some `` revolutions '' result in far worse regimes than their predecessors . 
  look at the khmer rouge , in cambodia , for example . 
  ( probably one of the very worst ) whenever there is a swing into extremism of the right or left , the chances get higher for a revolution and then a regime of the ( supposedly ) opposite political spectrum - but in fact , the two extremes are not so different in that extremes can and often do become tyrannical . 
  i hope not !, 
  also , i am not turkish . 
  maybe what would be appropriate would be for them to call for a new election ? 
  and have international observers , use paper ballots , transparent ballot boxes . . etc. 
  there is no denying that the situation in romania has improved since ceausescu , but they still have the highest child poverty of any developed nation ( the us is supposedly # 2 ) i think its safe to say romania still has a lot of problems that need addressing . 
  during the romanian revolution [ a huge network of tunnels ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-25/news/mn-715_1_secret-police ) was discovered underneath bucharest which were used for surveillance . 
  then , later on , they returned to denying that the tunnels existed . 
  i do n't think the us is at all unique in being involved in surveillance , unfortunately . 
  most ( all ? ), 
  nations are to some extent . 
  the www was invented at cern which is in switzerland . 
  the www is international . 
  the whole internet should be international in scope and governance . . 
  there should also be more choice and diversity in how addresses are resolved . 
  this not being my area i do n't know enough more about it to add much to the conversation . 
  americans are n't necessarily any worse ( or better ) than other governments . 
  i think what 's happening is that people are beginning to see the kinds of things which are really important to everybody . 
  the internet is still relatively new enough so that privacy has gotten short shrift in its development - and that 's worked to the advantage of governments who want to use it to various aims . 
  the more technology literate people make themselves , the more intelligent these discussions will become . 
  that will raise the transparency of what happens . 
  open source software offers many good alternatives to closed source , commercial systems . 
  also , the ietf , w3c.org , etc , have published a great many open protocols which are public and open to improvement by their user communities . 
  open cryptography generally is far more secure than commercial systems because it depends on public algorithms . 
  its not exactly what [ nicolai ceaucescu said ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ltw0wmhpg ) . 
  but still , ceaucescu 's last speech bears watching in this context . 
  website of [ the union of communist tyranny victims ' associations ( uokg ) ] ( http://www.uokg.de/cms/ ) former gdr prisoners : http://www.uokg.de/cms/ translate into english from german   http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=/language_tools&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.uokg.de%2fcms%2f -- `` our labour team lived on the upper floor of the factory with the windows covered , '' he told wdr about his time making hinges and other components for ikea furniture . 
  `` the machines were on the lower floor , and you had little rest . 
  on the factory floor you had no proper seating , no ear protection : no gloves . 
  conditions were even more primitive there then in the rest of the gdr . 
  it was slave labour . '' ----- ** _ note how fascist tyranny morphed easily into communist tyranny _ **, 
  somebody should tell these ftas - never say never ... 
  as long as its privatization . 
  they can not go back to public health care once they privatize it even one tiny bit . 
  that 's called the ratchet effect . 
  google `` standstill '' `` ratchet '' `` indirect expropriation '' ( *** firms would have to compensated for their lost expected profits if there is any change which impacts their profits !, 
  *** ) that means that even the smallest change to privatize one school or one kind of insurance , or sell water in one area , is like a noose that can never be undone that only gets tighter . 
  in your dreams - you should listen to me when i tell you these ftas are designed to quietly destroy public healthcare systems . 
  look at the uk if you do n't believe me . 
  that was caused by gats . 
  tisa is going to finish the job . 
  they still do n't even realize it . 
  its such an unpleasant realization that they are just in denial . 
  and who can blame them . 
  i have no idea what the situation with hong kong is . 
  although i would suspect that like many south asian countries they see a lot of potential future contract jobs ( in wealthy countries ) under mode four as being the payoff for participating in the entire fta system . 
  ftas have sections which decry the use of `` means tested subsidies '' because they distort markets . 
  so if i were you i would keep that in mind . 
  i know that means tested subsidies are always supposed to be temporary . 
  the neoliberal solution is to give the people who pay less , less . 
  for example , poor people could get `` copper plans '' which only pay half of their health care costs and give them a loan for the rest ( or perhas soon , put them into suspended animation until they have the money ) or robotic telemedicine delivered over the internet or from an ai instead of a doctor . 
  dont underestimate the power of this system to create extreme disparities in things like healthcare and education . 
  this is what it was designed to do . 
  they would n't invest decades of energy into creating it and bring it back over and over again under different names if they were not serious about implementing it . 
  when i saw that statement not long ago , i thought , yes , that is kind of how they do it . 
  dont underestimate the governments capacity or willingness to deceive the people right now . 
  this is all being driven by the exponential growth in technology that is eliminating the need for most ( not all ) human laborers , both unskilled and increasingly , skilled and office workers . 
  its a whole new world on the horizon and nobody has even the foggiest idea of what those many billions of people are going to do for money . 
  so they are trying to lock down the current system against the future , they are desperate to do that now before there is a global relization of this sea change . 
  really desperate . 
  this post ** is about tisa , the services agreement ** , not ttip - keep in mind that the multinational system uses jobs as a form of currency , jobs can not be traded if they are not in play , to be in play they must be privatized and managed by government - so then they can be put into the procurement system and put out for bidding - of course they want low cost countries companies to get those jobs and take half the wages , thats the whole idea .
