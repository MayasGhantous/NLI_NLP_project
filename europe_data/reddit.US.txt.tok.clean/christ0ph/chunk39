  the key word is manage . . however , there is every guarantee that they will not remain affordable . 
  thats the whole idea - profit , there is no profit in public health care !!!, 
  nor in other public services , no churning either , no power for politicians no bribes - ** they dont want that because so many jobs are going away for good so thats where the money is going to be , in the public sector . . ** get it ? 
  ... manages ... one could say the us system `` manages '' healthcare ( actually [ gats says we must outsource that too ] ( http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.405.5725&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf ) ) but ** that has absolutely zero bearing as to affordability - whih is entirely subjective - because any constraints on prices is against neo-liberal belief that the market decides every price for every thing . 
  if something is unaffordable , a good parallel is the attitute that says thats gods will , `` he must want those irish to starve '' . . basically it has the same effect . 
  good luck on that . .  in short , the fta system is for corporations and people dont have any standing in it except as the market , people dont really exist in the fta system , as far as i can see . 
  the intent was to create a new system that overruled the 20th century democratic rule of law system with regard to corporate interests and profits . 
  they were sick of people being put above corporations so they have been working day and night tirelessly to quietly replace it with this other system that explicitly says its not important . 
  *** also , as politicians have no standing , no statements or proclamations or ( this should be obvious ) quasi promises - this system is ciminogenic - it forces politicians to lie and become complicit because they must lie to justfy their own existence , and they are not about to tell the people they signed their rights away , woud you ? 
  - so no promises they make of any kind should ever be listened to in thse covered areas ( everything of economic importance to corporations ) because subsequently they will have almost no jurisdiction or standing once they sign away their people 's rights for those cushy jobs *** . 
  do n't confuse systems !, 
  these are new , fake courts and a new - wholly new system - to get what you want you have to be a corporation - its set up for them . 
  if they wanted to use national courts they would have but they want to set up their own kangaroo courts where they win all the time . 
  thats the whole point !, 
  ** they are making all sorts of truly outrageous lies both in the us and elsewhere to get rid of the responsibilities of government and still get paid as if they had not - so they will say anything to get it passed now . 
  is this the government that wants to prevent doctors from treating people in demonstrations ? 
  i think it is . 
  how outrageously evil . 
  good question . 
  very good question . 
  my guess it was shared outrage over ... something . 
  i do n't agree with this policy , i am just trying to explain it . 
  where have you been the last 20 years ? 
  read gats article 1:3 ( 1995 ), 
  read gats article 1:3, 
  like the massacre in [ battleship potemkin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unt6xyopdbs ) ? 
  good for them . 
  putin has been there for 15 years !, 
  we dont want to give people the wrong ideas about healthcare . 
  people would not pay for it if it was free . 
  so thats seen as a theft . 
  ( devaluing markets ), 
  they were buying and giving surplus locally grown food to poor people , in violation of the us agribusiness 's assertion that that was unfair to low cost providers here in the us . 
  another big issue is saving seeds . 
  farmers saving seeds - thats the way they used to do it , the traditional way , but we want all that to stop . 
  there were minoan `` colonies '' throughout the mediterranean and even some further away . 
  perhaps as far as india . 
  dont forget they were the model for atlantis myth , and also for tolkein re : `` numenoreans '', 
  it really does . 
  maybe its intent is partially to keep the king awake during his ( or her ) long kingly ( or queenly ) duties . 
  the minoan civilization was remarkably advanced . 
  they had multistory apartment buildings , plumbing , flush toilets , indoor heating and hot water . 
  i wonder where the world would be today if santorini had not erupted ? 
  probably at least a thousand years or so ahead of where we are now in technology . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/functional_constituency some countries give corporations votes , but do n't let people vote , yes , thats true . 
  if they miss work then that has a dollar value to the economy . 
  lost days , etc. 
  so to be counted they have to be employed and the worth of the cost or benefit is calculated based on their incomes . 
  children , housewives , and retired people do n't currently register on the risk-benefit ratio . 
  it appears the agreements are based on the territory and not on the government , so even a complete change of national leadership , name , political system , revolutions , etc , would not touch the property right to continue doing business in that market under effectively the same set of regulatory conditions . 
  for example , there is no expiration date . 
  right , exactly , there is no going back from privatization . 
  otherwise , governments could eliminate the value of an investment of several years for excuses like cost , as slovakia tried to do with health insurance in achmea ( formerly eureko ) v. slovak republic . 
  it was determined that they should have made that decision before they signed the fta with the netherlands . 
  so , their decision to privatize is irreversible because of isds . 
  its a whole new world , no longer will companies interests be second class citizens . 
  countries will still be free to legislate any issue that does not effect profits adversely without paying compensation based on the expected future profits . 
  these are the largest trade deals ever , they will effect 70 % of all jobs in at least 50 countries . 
  privatizing services lets the developed countries use those millions of high perceived value jobs as a kind of bait to get more leverage to enter the rapidly growing economies in south asia on favorable terms . 
  thats why we are giving up local sourcing and labeling requirements , which allegedly discriminate against low cost providers of goods and services . 
  new deal style programs and set-asides of any kind will also be impossible because they discriminate against our trading partners firms . 
  in exchange mutinationals will get access under `` national treatment '' and `` most favored nation '' rules . 
  so if a us engineering , healthcare or teaching staffing firm can become the low bidder on a job in india , say running a newly privatized school , they will have to give us the job and vice versa . 
  a level playing field . 
  obviously there will be winners and losers , as they say . 
  also , services are in tisa , not ttip . . tisa = trade in services agreement - see http://www.cesi.org/tisa-the-threat-to-public-services-by-the-backdoor/, 
  actually , in healthcare services `` more competition '' makes healthcare more , not less expensive . . see http://www.pnhp.org/resources/pnhp-research-the-case-for-a-national-health-program, 
  lol , thats exactly what they want you to think !, 
  tisa = trade in ** services ** agreement - even more secret than ttip . 
  thats the third of the 3 huge ftas . 
  tisa is the most secret one . . 
  ** tisa - the services agreement ** is in the wings , and this document is just a limited scope document of eu exceptions to ** ttip ** and many of those exact same things could and likely will be in tisa . 
  they want to trade jobs for markets , so it makes no sense to limit services to developed countries only , as jobs are the bait that would bring the developing countries into a big global tisa where the big services firms can locate in the countries with `` the most favorable environment '' see http://www.wti.org/fileadmin/user_upload/nccr-trade.ch/wp4/publications/working_paper_20143.pdf, 
  sounds like franco . 
  somewhere in cans the outtakes from the wicker man lie - the wicker man could be an even better film if they were found and added to it . 
  he was so good . 
  the very best at what he did . 
  i think the first and i still think the very best role i remember him in was as lord summerisle in the wicker man . 
  with britt ekland and edward woodward . 
  wow . 
  what a great movie . 
  in 1989 i demonstrated with chinese students against the crackdown in beijing , my friend and i were the first two americans to demonstrate in the whole country . 
  the first non-chinese-americans . 
  they were amazing . 
  they were very well organized . 
  they had a whole system set up to relay messages from faxes they were getting . 
  ( faxes could get sent out of the country ) i have copies of some of the faxes . 
  there desperately needs to be a global movement for sanity . 
  against denial of the worst excesses of the past in every country . 
  they do n't want to accept the fact that they fucked up many times in the past . 
  its a common problem in the us and china too . 
  but of course , ** if you can not remember the past you are condemned to repeat it . 
  not for long !,

  the endocrine society just released a study that shows a [ staggering cost in disease from endocrine disrupting chemicals ] ( http://press.endocrine.org/doi/10.1210/jc.2014-4324 ) in the eu . 
  hundreds of billions of euros each year . 
  people need to realize that we 're dealing with compulsive liars in governments who do n't seem to know what honesty is . 
  so the response needs to be absolutely huge and undeniable . 
  example on how arrogantly people are being treated . . the public consultation on ttip turned out to be a fabrication .
