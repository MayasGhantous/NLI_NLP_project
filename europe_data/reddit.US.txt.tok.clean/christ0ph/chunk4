  right ? 
  no , i am saying `` it will be like other trade agreements '' and the world has crumbled for by now , millions of people because of them . 
  here are 10 reasons isds needs to go , really the entire things need to go . 
  - isds introduces the ` fright to regulate ' which is bad for people and the planet . 
  the all-encompassing result of the flaws of the isds system -- outlined further below - is that governments will feel a sword of damocles hanging over their heads when they plan public-interest regulations on companies . 
  the european commission 's argument that nothing in isds affects the ` right to regulate ' is beside the point . 
  the threat of a costly legal dispute with a very uncertain outcome will act as a deterrent for many governments to protect citizens or the environment . 
  - isds uses citizens ' money to bail out corporations for risky investments : in total ttip would enable 75,000 companies to seek damages from eu and us governments ( hence citizens , through taxes ) . 
  [ 4 ] although isds became a regular feature of investment treaties in the 1960s , claims have ballooned over the past decade : 57 known new cases were launched in 2013 alone . 
  - isds grants special rights to foreign investors over everybody else . 
  only foreign investors can use isds panels ; domestic ones , let alone normal citizens , have to keep using the regular legal system . 
  - isds upsets legal systems , introducing arbitration on legislation . 
  dispute settlement systems in normal treaties seek to resolve conflicts directly related to the treaty . 
  isds , in contrast , allows companies to sue government for any legislation they deem unfair or inequitable that is developed after the treaty ; effectively introducing arbitration on legislation . 
  isds does not even require ` exhaustion of local remedies ' -- further undermining democracy and the rule of law . 
  isds is not intended as a last resort should all other legal routes fail ; it is explicitly designed to take place outside the normal legal systems . 
  - isds is not bound to legal precedent , ignoring the abc of international law and introducing further uncertainty : the lack of case law in isds has led to inconsistent arbitral decisions with different legal interpretations of identical or similar treaty provisions , further increasing uncertainty and fear referred to in point 1 . 
  - isds is the only international dispute settlement giving rights to corporations instead of states : dispute settlement procedures in other international treaties are state-state - even the world trade organisation dispute settlement is state-state . 
  - eu-level isds has never been impact-assessed : isds is a new eu level policy that can result in billions of euros flowing from eu citizens to foreign corporations in the future . 
  despite this , the european commission has not bothered to prepare an impact assessment on it , in dire contradiction with its own guidelines , [ 5 ] and just started to insert it in trade agreements it started to negotiate after the lisbon treaty . 
  - isds proceedings take place out of the public eye : isds cases are held behind closed doors and are fully confidential , even if cases being disputed involve matters of public interest . 
  - isds is unnecessary . 
  even almost without isds , the eu and us already trade gargantuan volumes : both blocs barter around $ 1.6 billion ( $ 2.2 billion ) [ 6 ] in goods and services every day , with more than $ 2.6 trillion ( $ 3.5 trillion ) in two-way direct investment per year [ 7 ] -- all this with only one-third of eu countries ( or 7 % of eu 's gdp ) covered by isds . 
  apparently investors already place significant trust in the regular legal systems . 
  - better alternatives exist : whereas isds is a subsidy , from the public purse , for activities at risk from tighter regulations , risk insurance is offered by a host of private providers but also for example by the multilateral investment guarantee agency ( a division of the world bank ) and others .

  `` lying git '' ? 
  sorry , i do n't know that one . 
  for me , `` git '' is a [ computer thing ] ( http://git-scm.com/ ) ... 
  look for a document by jane kelsey entitled `` how to read a services schedule '' then read this : [ gats and public services systems ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) - about the narrow interpretation of gats exceptions . 
  this is worth reading . . 
  it puts the issue into a longer context . . 
  this sounds to me like the old tar-baby briar patch routine . . you can bet whatever they have cooked up is just as bad without it as with . 
  according to some of the folks here , gats has no isds , the 1990s era gats is still quite nasty , its the reason the nhs is being privatized .

  do n't count on newly exported gas from the us , the energy companies have vastly overstated it 's extent in the past and its possible they are doing that now in hopes of turning ttip and its isds into a bailout/cover up of the ponzi investors . . 
  and he never has satisfactorily answered it . 
  while ive provided a great amount of data , additionally , the things i am saying reflect the values of both americans and europeans . 
  / u/savannajeff is basically saying `` trust us , we 're experts '' which would be exceedingly unwise , because its the equivalent of allowing a fox to guard a henhouse after innumerable chickens have already been found to be missing . 
  could you give me some examples of what you think is fabricated ? 
  in other words , a pump and dump situation . . 
  whenever something is made *** irreversible *** , that is no place for vagueness or ambiguity . 
  the [ precautionary principle ] ( http://www.sehn.org/precaution.html ) is a huge thing , imo . 
  especially with edcs - which [ are potent in very low concentrations ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3245362/ ) as we develop more complex xenobiotics ( man made chemicals ) '' [ better safe than sorry ] ( http://www.sehn.org/pdf/science,regulation.pdf ) '' makes more and more sense all the time . 
  its happening everywhere . 
  i think that at the root of the problem is the fact that the `` job '' as the world knew in the 20th century is morphing into a society where far far fewer people will `` need to work '' in terms of society being able to maintain the same ( or a higher ) level of productivity . . ( at a significant cost in resilience ) of course , just as their work is no longer needed , the billions of humanity still need to have an income to survive . 
  also , the education bar to employment is rising very rapidly . 
  is a race to the bottom on wages and labor conditions for those continuing to work inevitable ? 
  it should n't become what happens . 
  this is a good reference on us healthcare in comparative perspective - to other developed countries in particularly - `` lifespan science '' . . basically , people in the us have less access to affordable health care than people in most other developed countries . 
  http://www.iom.edu/reports/2013/us-health-in-international-perspective-shorter-lives-poorer-health.aspx or http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13497 stress also effects people healthy lifespans quite a bit . . [ this is basically a review paper with dozens of links on stress and the body 's responses to it ] ( http://physrev.physiology.org/content/87/3/873.long ) [ this shows how stress hastens the cognitive declines of aging ] ( http://www.sciencenewsline.com/articles/2014061811330013.html ) so there is a lot to be said for avoiding a `` race to the bottom '' as best as we can , in both the eu and the us !, 
  including an economic one . 
  [ the supposedly low cost health care in the so called `` affordable care act '' has huge hidden costs - so fewer and fewer americans all the time can afford to go to the doctor ] ( http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2014/october/09/charlotte-observer-hidden-costs-for-fully-insured-patients.aspx ), 
  yes , and environmental contamination , especially in eastern europe . . 
  if only we could put all of our heads together * to solve problems * , instead of * to not solve them * !, 
  europe uses a '' [ better safe than sorry ] ( http://www.sehn.org/pdf/science,regulation.pdf ) '' ( see links below also ) approach , the us uses an '' [ innocent until proven guilty ] ( http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/117-a104/ ) '' approach . 
  i think that when it comes to chemicals which have had adverse effects in animals , the ` precautionary principle '' ( see http://www.sehn.org/precaution.html ) approach is the * only prudent one * . 
  otherwise , we will have a problem that becomes impossible to fix not too far into the future . 
  for example , look at the emerging science of obesogens . 
  these largely unknown chemicals are everywhere in the environment , in plastic food packaging , in non stick cookware , in dental restorations , in matresses and sleepwear , in soda can liners , and dozens of other places . . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2713042/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3279464/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2718750/?report=printable, 
  well , the two have totally different * standards of evidence * when it comes to making regulatory decisions with public health impact ... thats very important . 
  the eu uses the [ precautionary principle ] ( http://www.sehn.org/precaution.html ) , the us uses an `` innocent until proven guilty '' approach . 
  these both discuss the issues at length . 
  http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/117-a104/ ( pdf version - http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/122/7/ehp.1408107.pdf ) http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1408107/ excerpt : similar distractions crop up in u.s. discussions , whether the participants are looking at incinerators , stem cells , or gmos . 
  what often sets european conclusions apart , however , is commitment to a tenet known as the precautionary principle . 
  the precautionary principle -- another way of saying `` better safe than sorry '' -- has been making its way into the regulatory practices of governments since the 1930s . 
  by the 1990s , major events such as the rio de janeiro earth summit began casting the idea in legal language . 
  in 1998 , the science and environmental health network convened an international gathering of scientists , philosophers , lawyers , and environmental activists at the johnson foundation wingspread conference center in wisconsin , yielding this succinct definition of the principle : `` when an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health , precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause-and-effect relationships are not fully established scientifically . '' members of the european union took note , and within two years had adopted a similar statement as the foundation for eu environmental regulation . 
  the result has imposed the juridical equivalent of `` guilty until proven innocent '' on any manufacturer seeking permission to introduce a product into the marketplace , demanding that public protection from potential harm be placed ahead of commercial interests . 
  such a requirement accounts for much of the administrative distance that separates europe from the united states , according to john bucher , associate director of the national toxicology program ( ntp ) , a multiagency toxicology and testing program housed at the national institute of environmental health sciences . 
  `` the u.s. system has evolved around the supposition that the government is responsible for providing information , or utilizing and acting on information supplied by industry , that would suggest that a particular chemical should n't be used in commerce , '' he says . 
  in other words , precaution is not imposed upon commercial interests as a default position ; instead , hazards and risks are defined by government on a case-by-case basis . 
  bucher suggests that although regulatory agencies evaluate the risks of agents fairly uniformly , they may pay more attention to cases that rise to political or social prominence . 
  nor can he and his colleagues in the ntp sway this tendency , since they lack the mandate of a regulatory agency and can not define or assess risk as part of their observations . 
  `` so we must couch things in terms of whether we have concerns over a particular level of human exposure that 's going on in the population , '' he says . 
  `` we do however , select agents for evaluation through our programs . 
  that we feel warrant regulatory agency consideration . '' the precautionary approach in the united states has been further stalled by a modest rider added to a congressional spending bill in 2001 -- two sentences with no official name but known alternately as the information quality act or the data quality act . 
  this seemingly minor legislation has become contentious for requiring federal agencies to optimize the `` quality , objectivity , utility , and integrity '' of the information supporting regulatory activities . 
  critics have highlighted this stipulation as a loophole for corporations to hold up the implementation of restrictions on their products . 
  for chris mooney , author of the 2005 book the republican war on science , this move represented `` an unprecedented and cumbersome process by which government agencies must field complaints over the data , studies , and reports they release to the public . 
  it is a science abuser 's dream come true . '' on the other hand , when the epa considered the endocrine-disrupting potential of the herbicide atrazine in 2003 , the data quality act was invoked to clarify the experimental methods that were being used to argue that such effects from this agent had been observed in frogs . 
  `` publication of a research article in a peer-reviewed scientific journal does not mean that the research has been accepted as valid by the scientific community and that it should be considered reliable for regulatory purposes , '' argued members of the center for regulatory effectiveness ( cre ) in correspondence published in the january 2004 issue of ehp . 
  a self-styled regulatory watchdog , the cre applauded the introduction of the legislation as a brake against an overzealous embrace of preliminary or incomplete research findings . 
  that said , the precautionary principle is not altogether absent from u.s. regulations . 
  in 2000 , the fda submitted a paper on its national food safety system to the organisation for economic co-operation and development , complete with an annex illustrating the role that precaution plays in the system . 
  this document outlined various adjustment factors that would be applied to account for prospects such as sensitive subgroups within a tested population , extrapolation from short-term study data to assess chronic effects , extrapolation from animal data to human application , and variations within a human population , such as age or sex . 
  still , the enforcement of precaution can raise new challenges that scientists do not yet know how to meet . 
  early in 2009 , the european parliament was putting the finishing touches on regulations banning chemicals that go into some of the world 's most widely used pesticides . 
  richard tren , director of the nonprofit organization africa fighting malaria , insists that the ban will prompt many nations on that continent to abandon their use of pesticides that are effectively and safely managing a public health scourge . 
  `` this is a victory for the environmental lobby and a defeat of sound science , '' he wrote in the 20 january 2009 edition of the vancouver newspaper the province . 
  `` sensible regulations should evaluate the risks posed by chemicals to humans and the environment based on sound scientific evidence . 
  regulators should n't be solely concerned with whether a pesticide is hazardous in the lab . 
  most important is how the pesticide is used and how diluted the active ingredient is . '' observers such as mcelgunn take another view . 
  `` dilution of toxicants is not a solution , even when all the science is in and we have a noael for sensitive end points , '' she says . 
  `` others would argue that sound scientific evidence should include both low-dose testing to uncover endocrine effects and neurodevelopmental effects , and cumulative assessments of substances that have similar properties or that produce similar adverse effects . '' for her part , rachel carson did not dismiss the use of chemical products , only their indiscriminate use -- and she charged policy makers with the responsibility to discriminate . 
  but weighing the scientific evidence in fulfillment of that responsibility is no simple task . 
  according to sarewitz , policy makers must deal with the harsh reality that there is not always one best way to use chemical compounds , which is why it can be so difficult to identify and eliminate toxicants . 
  `` we 're very glib about how easy that task is , '' he says , `` both in terms of the question of identifying what things do and the costs and consequences of getting rid of stuff . '' --------------------------------------------------- this discusses some of the recent history in the eu context . 
  when these agreements are in writing they specify that exemptions must be in writing . 
  they both ( tisa and ttip ) seem to refer to gats , so you should look to gats to see what public services ( besides the audiovisual services exempted by the french ) the gats rules are quite all-inclusive . .
