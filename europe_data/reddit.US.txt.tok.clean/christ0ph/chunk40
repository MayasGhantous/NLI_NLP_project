  i understand well enough `` how this works '' to recognize a pack of crooks when i see one . 
   and quite frankly , i dont give a damn on whether the us are exporting lng or not . 
  so you just care about discrediting what i brought up about ftas quite possibly resulting in the loss of minimum wage laws ? 
  i said a number things , which ones ? 
  but the us is not china . 
  also , china now is not the china it was then . 
  another problem is that because of isds , changes can only make business environments more profitable for multinational corporate investors , never less . 
  so , elimination of minimum wage lws is likely to be fta legal after signing an fta , but creation of a minimum wage law is likely to trigger an investor state lawsuit . 
  a similar situation occurred in egypt , egypt raised a minimum wage law and then they were sued in trade body by a french company . 
  they may be claiming to have invested in egypt because of their low wages . 
  in `` indirect expropriation '' cases , corporations sue taxpayers of countries for - `` expected lost profits '' that they claim to have lost because of a change , such as a law change or zoning regulation . 
  so , my original question was - as its my understanding that the european union was born out of what was originally an fta , i wanted to know what the status of these laws is now in europe . 
  blast from the past !, 
  read the fine print - https://www.citizen.org/documents/mode_four_h1b_visa_memo.pdf, 
  well , here is a problem - if there isnt public transparency , [ compulsive liars can promise the same important things to multiple groups of people ] ( https://www.citizen.org/documents/mode_four_h1b_visa_memo.pdf ) , and string them along forever , and never deliver to the ones who matter the most . 
  a little bit of advice - they always do that . 
  its their way . 
  50 countries are in tisa - the services deal . . lots of people seem to be confusing tisa and ttip . 
  the problem is its basically three free trade agreements , each one worse than the next - to understand ttip you also need to be able to see tisa . 
  unless you can see both , you wont understand the entire agenda , especially in areas that involve interrelationships between mode three - national treatment-and mode four - international temping -- and financial services like health insurance and banking , and healthcare related entitlements - for example , insurance firms getting entitlements to markets - like slovakia - the international trading of service jobs for market concessions which is basically privatization and temporary job contracts - and the procurement/bidding of same . 
  i 'm talking about disasters . 
  during disasters , often everything that possibly can go wrong , does . 
  no , we should not export lng . 
  deal with it . 
  what i am trying to say is that these trade deals may have grossly unexpected results - and that is an understatement . 
  for example , a ruling by wto that minimum wage laws stood as a barrier to market entry and that the us taxpayers had to pay a 10 million dollar a day fine , until the barrier was eliminated , would be a real tragedy in the us . 
   you are arguing with the backing of the possibility of a somewhat global volcano eruption - this is just unrealistic . 
  really huge volcanic eruptions effect an entire hemisphere - for example , a really large eruption anywhere in the northern hemisphere would likely effect around 2/3 of the globe , one around the equator likely would effect the whole planet . 
  typically , the effects on climate and crops vary quite a bit depending on how large the explosion was , what the constituents in the explosion are and how long it goes on . 
  see the chart at http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/laki-iceland-1783 re : us winter temps . 
  volcanism often produces large scale destruction of crops , but later on in the process , if the event laid down a layer of ash , sometimes that layer of ash helps to enrich the soil . 
  there you go again . 
  you are `` grossly misrepresenting '' the things ive said . 
  re volcanos - when they happen they cause many year long disruptions in global food supplies - for example , in europe http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/15/iceland-volcano-weather-french-revolution http://www.wired.com/2013/06/local-and-global-impacts-1793-laki-eruption-iceland/ the volcano argument is for conserving energy resorces that do n't reply on the sun , is basically what benjamin franklin , one of the founders of the us , and also an amateur scientist/renaissance man of his time , said . 
  --------  * `` the sun , at noon , looked as blank as a clouded moon , and shed a rust-coloured ferruginous light on the ground , and floors of rooms ; but was particularly lurid and blood-coloured at rising and setting . 
  at the same time the heat was so intense that butchers ' meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed ; and the flies swarmed so in the lanes and hedges that they rendered the horses half frantic ... the country people began to look with a superstitious awe , at the red , louring aspect of the sun . 
  '' *  * `` across the atlantic , benjamin franklin wrote of `` a constant fog over all europe , and a great part of north america '' . 
  *  * `` the disruption to weather patterns meant the ensuing winter was unusually harsh , with consequent spring flooding claiming more lives . 
  in america the mississippi reportedly froze at new orleans . 
  '' *  * `` the eruption is now thought to have disrupted the asian monsoon cycle , prompting famine in egypt . 
  environmental historians have also pointed to the disruption caused to the economies of northern europe , where food poverty was a major factor in the build-up to the french revolution of 1789 . 
  '' *  * `` volcanologists at the open university 's department of earth sciences say the impact of the laki eruptions had profound consequences . 
  '' *  * `` dr john murray said : `` volcanic eruptions can have significant effects on weather patterns for from two to four years , which in turn have social and economic consequences . 
  we should n't discount their possible political impacts . '', 
  greg neale is founding editor of bbc history magazine * '' -------------- bluntly , i document issues i post about . 
  you do n't . 
  so , until you can start arguing based on facts - i think your arguments are the ones which are lacking . 
  is this what they mean ?

  i personally feel that at least in the us , minimum wages are needed - and that they should be higher . 
   how can a minimum wage be a technical entry barrier ? 
  one `` being seen as '' a `` technical barrier to entry '' of firms from trading partners by a trade organization like wto is a hell of a lot different than being a technical barrier to entry in reality . . imo . 
  and the framing is designed to conceal the huge inequality . . 
  but the way that a trade organization may see a minimum wage as a barrier might be because they might frame it as blocking the main `` competitive advantage '' of the services/staffing firm from the developing country - which ** is likely to be price ** . 
  if you are the wto , who gains jurisdiction over globally traded markets - the wto - which elevates markets above everything , all other things being equal , who is going to win every battle , the expensive seller of xyz services , or the cheap one ? 
  also , [ see here : under standstill ] ( http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/gats_03_e.htm#comm ) , everything has to proceed towards more , always away from less `` services liberalisation '' . 
  thats the famous standstill , ratchet , etc. 
  the one way road to liberalisation with no exits . 
  just wait !, 
  ttip and its energy chapter are coming , soon .

  i ca n't see how the land could have suddenly materialized . . also there must be some reason neither serbia or croatia want it . . unexploded ordnance , maybe , ( mines ? ), 
  or a toxic waste dump . . 
  he 's right . 
  deals -- there are two , tisa is the services deal , ttip is everything else . . tisa is 50 countries , and hopes to be the successor to gats . 
  one of many big mistakes in both tisa and ttip is endorsing the 1995 gats agreement 's goal of mandatory privatization of services . 
  well , i have afeeling that this is likely to happen a lot with global warming . 
  the same thing applies to lots of coastal areas around the world . 
  thats a huge amount of extremely fertile arable land we are losing . 
  the us state of louisiana has lost a great deal of former land in the mississippi delta . 
  it does n't take much as the land in places like that if flat and very low elevation as it was deposited by the river as very fine soil that washed down from the mountains , etc. 
  we need to start thinking of soil as precious ad conserving it . 
  perhaps they should truck that precious soil away to higher ground where there is less chance of further erosion . 
  no , i do n't think it can be considered land for the taking because people fled for their lives during a storm and didnt come back for a few days . 
  that is under duress . 
  this reminds me of `` sealand '' which claims to be an independent monarchy on an old anti-aircraft gun platform off the coast of england . 
  we have to face the fact that there is a vitally important function to subsistence farming and farmers in poor countries that should not be framed in corporate terms , ever . 
  there is a value to certain kinds of inefficiency - because it creates resilience in a society . 
  google `` green box ''  fighting programs that give food for the poor ? 
  do you have a source for this ? 
  the nafta seems to have given foreign companies a new `` right '' to sue mexican towns for substantial amounts of money if they try to prevent or stop development for environmental reasons . 
  a canadian province , ontario , is being sued ( the lone pine case ) because they want to prevent fracking in the st. lawrence river valley . 
  personally , i think communities shoud have the right to do what 's best for their people . 
  there is a similar situation in el salvador , the pacific rim case . 
  a ( canadian ? ), 
  company is suing el salvador because they want to stop them from mining because the likelihood is high that the development would adversely impact the only water supply for a large area . 
  when people of a country 's health and future is at stake , i think the best interests of the people should take precedence over development for its own sake . 
  in electronics manufacturing , even amateur electronics manufacturers who manufacture products in fairly small numbers are buying cheap pick and place machines to automate their smt parts placement . . 
  so i think automation is pretty much the future everywhere . 
  for that reason i think these ftas are nuts because they are trying to dismantle safety nets that the world needs to be creating more of . 
  because in 35 years we 'll literally have machines that think and long before then they will be doing every job that is scriptable far eter than any human ever could . 
  we need new models and those models are ging to have to be positive ones because the models of our current system are broken . 
  we wouldnt have these armies of sock puppets arguin these really profoundly broken ideologies if we didnt have a big problem with wealthy people always being able to throw money at a situation and get their way . 
  it seems to me that there are people who in fact want to break everything and force rapid , disruptive change instead of have an honest dialogue about where we are going and thats bad for everybody and irresponsible . 
  if their arguments were good ones they would not be panicking . 
  wto and other neoliberal entities frame government subsidies of any kind of trade distorting and as thefts from corporations of markets . 
  ** for example , public health care is framed as an undesirable monopoly , irregardless of the fact that almost nobody in the us can afford adequate non-group health insurance any more ( the last year a majority - more than 50 percent could was in the early 90s ) - so less than one in six of our wage earners can afford this system that we still are forcing on people - why ? 
  because itsneoliberal ideology that we are using to try to privatize and plunder for ptofit the safety net of sick people all around the world . 
  attacking affordable public healthcare which has been shown to work - with an extremist ideology that cares not one whit if it kills liyerally millions of people as it has here . 
  a system that claims to support innovatiohn , but which in fact is designed to prevent innovative people from being able to afofrd to starting entrepreneurial businesses which would create jobs , ( tisa is also going to destroy a huge number of non-global businesses by pitting the foreign middle class against the us middle class for the same jobs ! ),
