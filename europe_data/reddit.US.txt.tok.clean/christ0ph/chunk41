  so that big companies can prevent competition and innovation - and which literally strips people of everything they have when they get sick from he ever increasing load of toxic chemicals around us , laws against which we are also using neoliberalism to try to block - all around the world - in ttip , for example - ciel.org has documented this - a system that does not allow any more than the richest people to afford `` insurance '' that adequately prevents bankruptcy - and that its business model is dumping people when they get sick - that does not matter . 
  having something work does not matter , the ideology is put on top . 
  you are trying to hide this fact , you know its true . 
  us manufacturing is automating so unless they are engineers , i doubt it . 
  made * by them * through corruption and the revolving door . 
  the main goal of ftas it seems now is to get rid of the global safety nets before society becomes aware of the changes - because they are really needed in the coming years and that will require progressive taxation and not a global race to the bottom as they are trying to scare the world into . 
  we 're all in this together . 
  even the wealthy would enjoy a much higher standard of living in a sustainable global multicultural society without the huge extremes caused by accumulated wealth . 
  for example , here in the us , the most unequal , tiered health care system in the world ( they even have separate waiting rooms , like in the old south ) - which is supposed to be the best in the world for the rich - well , i have news for you , it isnt - why ? 
  because you can not mix good care with crap care and hide the fact that some of it is truly crap care under bs . 
  thats asking for legal trouble - so it all has to become crap care . 
  one would be tempted to laugh , except its not funny . 
  it means that people who might otherwise get told about some health issue , are n't , because it isnt considered to be one any more , thanks to hmo pressure not to diagnose illness . 
  so , the tiered system is rapidly dragging he legal standard of health care for the wealthy down below - the legal `` standard of care '' the poor get in many european nations - for liability reasons !, 
  even in wealthy cities where the legal standard of care has remained much higher , its happening . 
  and doctors are confused . 
  dont fall for promises of jobs - the [ studies i have seen ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/ttip%20jobs.html ) suggest that the economics of these things are very much anti jobs - not pro jobs . 
  unless you mean jobs for people who are running services firms in developing countries that hope to be able to grab contracts after tisa servces liberalization in the wealthy countries , and indeed that will probably happen and be good for them , although workers in the developed countries will lose out because they can not compete on cost , even with minimum wage laws . 
  minimum wage laws may be struck down [ as trade barriers ] ( http://www.cuts-geneva.org/pacteac/images/documents/eac%20forum/forum17/eac%20geneva%20forum-%20wto%20note%2017.pdf ) , actually , because they stand as a trade barrier to the firms from developing nation 's winning contracts that they would be entitled to based on their main * competitive advantage * , low wage costs . 
  so - that should be illustrative of the changes we are going to see . 
  market forces are elevated above everything that society sees as right and wrong , and that is very wrong - the trade deals are built on 25 years of back room dishonesty by leaders we trusted who were stabbing the world in the back behind closed doors . 
  everything they are saying must be a lie because its all so dishonest our heads would explode if they told even a shred of the truth . 
  they have no intention of creating any new jobs for the former middle and working class in the developed countries . 
  this is just about profit and sleazy dishonest ways of eliminating democratic rule of law by the back door . 
  and derailing movements against corruption in both the rich and poor countries by keepng people on the brink of starvation during these transition years of the current system . 
  why ? 
  because whats really happening is abundance . 
  jobs should be cutting hours and passing more profits n to workers . 
  people should be spending that new free time in school . 
  they know this is true but they can not do it themselves , they need society to say no to them . 
  desperately . 
  its for their own good . 
  they are addicts and we enable them by fear . 
  the free trade deals are basically an attack on democracy - a preemptive attack . 
  do n't expect unskilled people to get jobs in manufacturing . 
  those unskilled jobs are vanishing forever globally . 
  even in the really cheap labor countries are automating . 
  the main goal is to get rid of the global safety nets because they are realy needed in the coming years . 
  again , manufacturing is rapidly automating . 
  people who dont have those technical skills need to facethe fact that those jobs they had 20 or 30 years ago with just a high school diploma or some college are gone for good , and deal with it . 
  they just tell people its temporary yo prevent any actual discussion of the important issues of where the world is going as jobs vanish - what we need is a society that refocuses on knowledge and learning and sustainable forward looking society , and moving out into space - all of us , all species too . . and not just greed . 
  the free trade deals are basically an attack on democracy - a preemptive attack . 
  manufacturing now is growing more and more technically sophisticated , so people are needed less and less . 
  so , the reason they are in mexico is less and less cheap labor - because automation is basically free labor . 
  it is is environmental ( lack of ) standards . 
  so many families have broken up because of dr-cafta , i have read . 
  whole towns depopulated , gang violence , lots and lots of bad effects on communities . 
  and apparently the us is incensed because farmers save seeds from one year to use in the next - what is the deal with that ? 
  also , why are they fighting programs that give poor people food ? 
  [ eu-canada trade deal leak ` ridicules ' ttip consultation , campaigners say ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/science-policymaking/eu-canada-trade-deal-leak-ridicules-ttip-consultation-307797 ), 
  its defined in gats article 1:3 whch is referred to as the definition in http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/st-11103-2013-dcl-1/en/pdf and a similar document in tisa , which is the broader ( more countries , - the rationale for needing a broader mix of developing and developed nations [ can be seen here ] ( http://www.wti.org/fileadmin/user_upload/nccr-trade.ch/wp4/publications/working_paper_20143.pdf ) . ), 
  tisa is the more secret fta that actually is * about * services including '' [ the fourth mode of supply ] ( http://www.google.com/search?q=%22the+fourth+mode+of+supply%22 ) '' . 
  all sorts of services - '' [ everything you can not drop on your foot ] ( http://www.google.com/search?q=%22everything+that+you+cannot+drop+on+your+foot%22 ) '', 
  200 % sounds like an awfully low amount . 
  it already has far exceeded that , it seems . 
  there were 150,000 responses to the requests for comments , almost all of them were against ttip . 
  that was a record . 
  and guess what - it turned out that their consultations were a complete sham - it came out that the panel had already made the decision and proceeded to act on it and the dates of when the other agreement was deciding on isds showed beyond a doubt that they were literally just wasting the time of the 150,000 people who responded - that is what they really should focus on . 
  they were literally only pretending to take consultations . 
  this is one of the reasons why a lot of people are wondering if the wuropean union continues to have legitimacy - as it seems as if democracy was definitely broken in that case - they were elegally required to accept real consultations and they did n't - they faked it - that is why they were trying to trivialize their content , its because they themselves were behaving in such a way as to make their proceeding invalid . 
  a similar dishonesty occurred in the us with health care reform and the 2008 election and subsequent `` debate '' . 
  it turns out that [ trade policy ( gats ) already predetermined the outcome ] ( http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.405.5725&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf ) - so the entire `` debate '' in 2009 was faked . 
  in the us , however , less than 1 % of all americans even realize three not one fta is being discussed and that they willi impact almost everybody negatively in a great many ways . 
  they are intentionally hiding them . 
  see the lnks i just posted a second ago just a moment ago in this thread . 
  ttip and tisa ( the services agreement ) [ borrow this definition ] ( http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/st-11103-2013-dcl-1/en/pdf ) in its entirety to define their `` scope '' and so understanding them requires we look at the jurisprudence surrounding the 1995 gats agreement to grasp the nature of the attack on services . 
  few people seem to have had the time to even read the now public '' [ mandate '' document ] ( http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/st-11103-2013-dcl-1/en/pdf ) in ttip and the leaked tisa documents so almost nobody seems to know this . 
  but a look at the literature on [ gats article 1:3 ] ( http://www.ciel.org/publications/publicservicesscope.pdf ) will open your eyes . 
  not even public education is excluded in any country that has even a single private school . 
  good descriptions of the extreme narrowness of the definition that proponents of these deals insists `` protects '' public services - do n't be folled by their misrepresentations !, 
  the definition in article 1:3 of the wto-gats agreement states : `` for the purposes of this agreement ... ( b ) ` services ' includes any service in any sector except services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority ; ( c ) ' a service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority ' means any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis , nor in competition with one or more service suppliers . '', 
  the `` governmental authority '' exclusion is very narrow . 
  this exclusion is far narrower than it may at first appear . 
  ( discussions at http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm http://www.ciel.org/publications/publicservicesscope.pdf , http://libr.org/gats/gats-article-1-3.pdf , http://www.ictsd.org/downloads/2008/06/cassim_steuart_part3.pdf and many others . 
  people need to know the meaning of this definition to understand the real nature of ttip and tisa . 
  article 1:3 of the wto-gats agreement - which is borrowed in its entirety in ttip and tisa , is cited by proponents as `` protecting government services '' from mandatory dismembering and privatization - however , that exclusion is so narrow as to almost never apply - gats article 1:3 states : * `` for the purposes of this agreement ... * ( b ) ` services ' includes any service in any sector except services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority ; ( c ) ' a service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority ' means any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis , nor in competition with one or more service suppliers . '', 
  the `` governmental authority '' exclusion is very narrow . 
  this exclusion is far narrower than it may at first appear . 
  discussions of the issues appear and should be read at http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm http://www.ciel.org/publications/publicservicesscope.pdf , http://libr.org/gats/gats-article-1-3.pdf , http://www.ictsd.org/downloads/2008/06/cassim_steuart_part3.pdf and many others . 
  imho , the use of gats article 1:3 to define the scope of services liberalisation ( privatization ) by the us - style trade deals is nothing less than an attack on the entire concept of governmental service and affordable public services . 
  maybe because most unskilled and medium skilled jobs are going away globally - and they see what the oiligarchs are trying to do ? 
  so , you ca n't deal with the fact that some people are real and have opinions ? 
  what is that called , projection ? 
  ask them, 
  i do n't understand a single word you said , are you drunk ? 
   * `` yeah man , it 's so weird ... * sorry . 
  maybe you should try again when you are sober . 
  there are literally trillions of dollars to be made from irreversibly privatizing the safety nets . 
  the scope will be huge , and the revolving door is going to be very big . 
  there will be jobs for them in these industries they can work as lobbyists and then go back into public service . 
  we in the us are very familiar with it , we call it `` the revolving door '' . 
  the payoffs are huge . 
  much too big for them to ignore . 
  actually , the scope of the new rules - based on gats article 1:3 - are very broad - very very broad - only services covered under the [ very narrow governmental authority ] ( http://www.ciel.org/publications/publicservicesscope.pdf ) are excluded - - the mandatory privatization and globalization/bidding/procurement criteria for ttip/tisa , ( basically it is an extension of gats - the fourth mode of supply ) is very broad and the new procurement rules will apply to everything that gets any government money at all . 
  even just a few dollars from a rebate . 
  so thats going to be more and more globalization and cross border trade in services - between all 50 tisa nations . 
  this is the long promised [ developing nations pay off from the globalization agenda ] ( http://www.wti.org/fileadmin/user_upload/nccr-trade.ch/wp4/publications/working_paper_20143.pdf ) . 
  you know , i have never met a single person in the flesh who supports these things . 
  why all the online support ? 
  something is n't right .
