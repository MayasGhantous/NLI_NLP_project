  well , how about [ lthat they have been lying that it would create jobs , that it would likely cost a huge number of jobs ] ( http://ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/ttip%20jobs.html ) . 
  how about it would [ gut the wise use of the precautionary principle ] ( http://ciel.org/trade_sustainable_dev/ttip_responses_12may2014.html ) in the eu , making it extremely hard to regulate still unregulated , known to be dangerous chemicals , including [ endocrine disruptors ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=endocrine+disruptor ) known to cause birth defects and serious illnesses such as cancer , diabetes , metabolic syndrome , morbid obesity , sterility , neurological damage , autism . 
  here is the precautionary principle that corrupt politicians and well connected agribusiness and chemical industry lobbyists want to overturn using ttip . 
  * `` the precautionary principle or precautionary approach to risk management states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment , in the absence of scientific consensus that the action or policy is not harmful , the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action . 
  '' *  * `` the principle is used by policy makers to justify discretionary decisions in situations where there is the possibility of harm from making a certain decision ( e.g. 
  taking a particular course of action ) when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking . 
  the principle implies that there is a social responsibility to protect the public from exposure to harm , when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk . 
  these protections can be relaxed only if further scientific findings emerge that provide sound evidence that no harm will result . 
  '' *  * `` in some legal systems , as in the law of the european union , the application of the precautionary principle has been made a statutory requirement in some areas of law . 
  they do n't care what people think , they always get their way . 
  its secret - and irreversible and antidemocratic - and it 's more likely to killjobs than create them , and it worsens inequality , and helps dismantle safety nets , but its good for the ultra big corpos . . what we know about whats in it , its like an extension of the bad ftas in the past all of which failed . . or were only endorsed in their most extreme forms by ideologically driven nations with hidden agendas . 
  i 'm sure they will find a way . 
  this one is actually three , tisa - the services part currently being negotiated in geneva - with thousands of corporate lobbyists - is the worst - tisa is the worst . . mai failed , gats 2000 failed - so this time they tried splitting all the bad stuff into three and lying over and over about everything . 
  more than 150,000 people responded to their consultation . 
  responses that they then claimed were invalid . 
  here is another resource on the scope of services privatizations . 
  people ca n't just move , they have to clean up corruption . 
  but once something has been privatized then the taxpayers would have to buy it back , often at huge huge cost - because the money is based on lost expected profits . 
  you have to understand , trade deals contain statements to the effect that privatization is the desired goal . 
  they snuck those things in there [ example 1 ttip - see where it refers to gats ] ( http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/st-11103-2013-dcl-1/en/pdf ) [ example 2 gats ( from 1990s - still in effect - they dont have finite terms - which is another problem ] ( http://www.ciel.org/publications/publicservicesscope.pdf ) and they do n't tell people this . 
  the name sounds similar to that of a company that sued egypt for raising their minimum wage * after * they signed a trade deal . 
  see [ veolia propret\u00e9 v. arab republic of egypt , icsid case no . 
  arb/12/15 ] ( http://www.italaw.com/cases/2101 ) this is despite the arab spring . 
  they are still fighting i think . 
  it hasnt been resolved . 
  people , please read up on [ gats article 1:3 ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) to understand a core concept in services privatization , the very narrow scope of exemptions from mandatory services privatizations that have not been explicitly carved out . 
  if your country pays its debts , no matter how illegitimate they are , and keeps water free , in other words , does not allow it to be sold , in any way . 
  ( you must [ read and understand the meaning of gats article 1:3 to understand this ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) ), 
  market inelasticity like that is the nirvana of profitmaking . 
  they would have to pollute it quite badly , or there would have to be a very serious war first in order to successfully sell or meter clean air .

  white gold , ive heard it called . 
  i 'm sorry , i just do n't remember where i read it . 
  it was a long time ago . 
  lol . . exponential improvements in technology have nothing to do with it ? 
  russia and north korea , isis , and the terrorism du jour are the unintentional saviors of the us defense industry . 
  that 's for sure . 
  when the former soviet union fell , frankly they were very worried that us defense budgets would be slashed . 
  but immediately , the iraqis kindly invaded kuwait , and the rest is history . 
  does the us pay them to do whatever they do ? 
  i doubt it . 
  but if it all did stop , i do n't know what they would do . 
  definitely they would do something . 
  they would n't let peace break out . 
  yes , they are . 
  very much so . 
  they are the end of real democracy . 
  the government is supposed to get out of the picture soon . 
  leaving the person and the kind of service they can afford which could be minimal , for exmple , i think its quite reasonable to expect some services like caring for the sick , may be done overseas , like on nauru . 
  ( which os specializing in things like that ) or for example , health insurance may include suspended animation until you can pay . 
  not care . 
  it may save your life but by the time you wake up , everyone you know is dead and your 25 million euro degree completely worthless . 
  for poor people they could have the head only option . 
  which would cost more to recover from . 
  ( they only store the head , since its smaller ) the point i am making is that since jobs are going away , the safety net is going away . 
  what use will the rich have to take care of the poor if the poor are no longer making them rich . 
  its about time . 
  scientology was designed from day 1 to be a scam . 
  it was a joke that succeeded . 
  maybe , but criminals from that era who remain unpunished still do need to pay for their crimes . 
  there is no statute of limitations for genocide or any other crime against humanity . 
  if the serb community does n't like that , they better be prepared to go it alone on the planet . 
  like north korea , for example . 
  idiots . 
  when can we get a normal government back ? 
  does anybody know ? 
  it certainly seems so . 
  even reddit mods often seem to find some way to blot out stories on the trade agreements . 
  this is a phenomenally small amount of coverage for trade agreements that in one way or another will probably [ effect almost everybody ] ( http://www.ttip2014.eu ) in the eu , the us and canada , some people a great deal ( for example , for some , the difference could amount to hundreds of thousands of euros in extra costs over a lifetime due to privatized health care due to ttip or tpp , or massive `` liberalization '' ( privatization ) of public services and public service jobs under tisa - things like the proposed deregulation of environmental and chemical laws will clearly come at increased costs to those in society least able to absorb those costs , the poor . 
  trying to find a good description of the recent election results . . swedes - what does it mean to you ? 
  ( note : a similar anti-precautionary law was passed in the us during the reagan era and its why the us has a backlog and lacks regulation of many known dangerous chemicals including many endocrine disrupters as well as very lax enforcement of existing environmental laws . 
  this has caused a lot of human misery including communities where a lot of people are sick but nobody can really get any justice . 
  despite the right wing assertions that america has `` too much '' litigation the fact is that lawsuits over a great many serious problems ( including medical malpractice which is arguably is the fifth leading cause of death in the us ) are at all time lows . 
  ------ ( obama 's trade policy is continuing this janus faced contradictory public vs. backroom disconnect - aggressively undermining the stated aims in his administration 's pr policy in their backroom trade deals . 
  especially on health care/rx drug pricing/environment/fracking / energy . ), 
  [ particularly illustrative example for europeans of the pr campaign by proxy ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) ( no , virginia , obamacare is not a step on the road to single payer , this is a scheme designed to throw media misled americans off the track so we wont figure out whats being done with the 3 ftas until its too late - or ( 3 ftas , 4 names beginning with t since ttip was introduced as tafta here in the us !, 
  ) , even though there is no need for two different names - both names are in english !!, 
  slick , huh - its like a big arrogant game for them , to mislead us . . also , they have been shrouded in such extreme secrecy that even legislators can not read them except under surveillance in s a small room , with no computers or aides allowed . . * so much for democracy under neoliberalism ? 
  * ( they are trying to execute a coup , basically , using isds and its ilk to turn democracy into an emasculated parody of democracy . 
  we already have that here in the usa because of isds . 
  a similar process was used to [ block out any discussion of single payer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwbzz070m-k ) , also see the following two links - a few weeks after that video , after publishing an [ amazing paper on gats and us healthcare ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) , nick skala [ was suddenly dead ! ] ( https://www.google.com/#q=nicholas+skala+memorial ) . 
  single payer , what the uk used to have , which poll after poll showed a majority of americans want . . and many still want , despite being told over and over again that its impossible , without being told that our rights have been sold - we know single payer is better so they are now trying to convince people that single payer means insurance companies are still there and still in charge , a situation which leads to ever worsening health care and denial . 
  a recent study in cio magazine [ showed that the forced privatizations of public services often fail ] ( http://www.inthepublicinterest.org/sites/default/files/1213%20out_of_control.pdf ) , and that a big reason for them is looting . 
  the goal is to keep these things in closed session with hundreds of lobbyists - behind our backs until its too late . 
  there also is virtually zero news coverage of the 3 ftas or dozens of other important issues in the us media another example - the other day 300,000 to 500,000 people marched on central park west for action to reduce greenhouse gases and fracking , virtually no news media covered the huge miles long event . . at the same time the media was all agog at the big story , a few dozen new yorkers lining up to buy iphones at the nyc apple store . 
  last time i looked there had been no major media ttip coverage since mid june !, 
  none . 
  if you asked 100 americans about ttip i would be surprised if more than one or two knew what it was . 
  and of course , we 've been told that the privatization of us healthcare by the ~ ~ neo ~ ~ `` liberal '' obama administration is just a [ `` stepping stone to single payer '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q= `` stepping + stone + to + single + payer '' ) !!!, 
  they have no shame ! ), 
  -------- during the gw bush administration a law put political appointees in charge of the final word as well as veto power on enforcement , promotions , and also forbade any unapproved statements to media at many regulatory agencies . 
  this politics before professionalism structure mimics one of the worst , most hated features of communism . . `` kommisars '' . 
  i do n't know if it is still in place but i suspect it is . 
  ( almost the people i knew who worked in federal agencies retired around that time . ), 
  its also a classic regulatory capture situation . 
  please compare the two statements below ... ------- this is the tories deregulation bill - 83 exercise of regulatory functions : economic growth ( 1 ) a person exercising a regulatory function to which this section applies must , in the exercise of the function , have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth . 
  ( 2 ) in performing the duty under subsection ( 1 ) , the person must , in particular , consider the importance for the promotion of economic growth of exercising the regulatory function in a way which ensures that -- ( a ) regulatory action is taken only when it is needed , and ( b ) any action taken is proportionate . 
  the bill goes on to clarify what a `` regulatory function '' might be : ( a ) a function under or by virtue of an act or subordinate legislation of imposing requirements , restrictions or conditions , or setting standards or giving guidance , in relation to an activity , or ( b ) a function which relates to the securing of compliance with , or the enforcement of , requirements , restrictions , conditions , standards or guidance which , under or by virtue of an act or subordinate legislation , relate to an activity .
