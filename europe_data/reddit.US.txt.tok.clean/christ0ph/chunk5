  very little is exempted under it , when businesses already exist supplying that service to * some * people . 
  people who look at what could be covered should take care to use the most extreme us interpretation ( in the understanding on commitments in financial service ) which is i understand the one being pushed . 
  note that as far as i know , even `` heads of government '' are forced to use this reading room situation . . * so they have plausible deniabiliy * . 
  also , how could anything which one head of government say effect others ? 
  we americans were given a pile of crap that in effect promised that if we elected obama and supported his privatization efforts , [ we would eventually get single payer ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=%22stepping+stone+to+single+payer%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8 ) public health care . 
  if these ftas pass , expect a great deal more lying because they are `` criminogenic '' - in that they promote politicians lying to tell the population that they have more power than they do . 
  the ftas will tie their hands as far as doing any kind of good thing . . because the way they work - it makes governments simply doing their jobs subject to liability to corporations . 
  so , to justify their existence , politicians end up having to become part of a big lie , which they then muct lie more and more to cover up . 
  thank you !, 
  i can not overemphasize that fact , its been going on for a very long time . 
  were it not for a snippet of a conversation on a long gone radio show that was accidentally captured when i was taping `` new music '' i would myself not know . 
  even ( most ) us public radio does n't discuss the ftas practically at all . 
  nobody here even knows this controversy exists . 
  tisa is the most secret for a reason , its going to pit the skilled workers in the developing world against those in the developed countries . 
  i am terrified what that is going to do . . tisa is very scary . 
  the reason the developed countries are pushing so hard to privatize public jobs is so they can then trade those millions of teaching , etc. 
  jobs - exchange them , for access for their exporters to the huge markets in the developing countries ( * where all the growth will be in their model of the future * . ), 
  its not a good model because it requires screwing a lot of people who are struggling now , and it will not lead to better working conditions for the workers who come either , they will be like the enslaved guest workers in the emirates , tied to a single job and unable to do anything - ask for better wages or working conditions because they will all be subcontractors or sub-sub-contractors etc. 
  the computerized tisa procurement system will encourage a complete devolution of accountability . 
  when things break as they inevitably will , it will be very hard to get compensation . 
  imagine how that would effect dealing with , say , an oil spill , or a really botched operation in a hospital staffed by a multinational staffing firm . 
  please make people aware that its not like americans want this , or wanted a neoliberal administration . 
  most americans have never heard the word neoliberal and have never been told about gats and have only the vaguest idea about the wto , etc. 
  they have intentionally deceived us . 
  99.99 % of us dont even know there are these treaties being negotiated in secret , or what they attempt to do and if americans did , we would be equally angry . 
  how little do we know about current us trade policy 's embedded ideology ? 
  we americans know so little that politicians get away with making promises which are completely impossible under ustr 's current fta ` commitments ' and under pending ` agreements ' , even more so . 
  [ example ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/search?q= `` stepping + stone + to + single + payer '' ) . 
  what are the chances that they could develop sustainable energy sources - maybe not this year , but , say , within the next few years ? 
  allyson pollock in the uk 's stuff is pretty good . 
  she has written about gats and the nhs quite a bit . 
  her predictions have come true , in spades . 
  ( its been going on since the late 1990s . ), 
  do they charge people * to leave ? * . 
  that is what i was getting at . 
  not if the drought continues , they will need it to desalinate and pump water . 
  otherwise the whole southwest may dry up without it . 
  millions of homes made worthless , many thousands of farms bankrupted . 
  you mean when people arrive , ( fairly normal on some level ) or when they * leave * , then , are they taxed again ? 
  ( i 've heard so many strange stories of taxation from europeans , nothing would surprise me any more . ), 
  # 1 he has zero standing . 
  as he 's just a politician . 
  that makes zero ability to make promises . 
  for example , [ look at this in the us ] ( http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/10/reid-says-obamacare-just-step-toward-eventual-sing/ ) , clearly , this is a promise that [ directly contradicts gats and us trade policy ] ( http://www.maine.gov/legis/opla/ctpchlthcaresub.pdf ) . 
  it makes no difference . 
  its just to make the uninformed people feel secure when they should be demonstrating for a complete dumping of the existing and pending ftas and new ones to be made with public involvement . 
  # 2 services = [ tisa more than ttip ] ( http://www.cesi.org/tisa-the-threat-to-public-services-by-the-backdoor/ ) ( trade in services agreement ) so its likely they are playing a shell game with you . 
  # 3 countries will likely end up having to exempt their services explicitly , ** [ unless there are no services similar to the ones involved ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/ournhs/john-hilary/on-ttip-and-nhs-they-are-trying-to-bamboozle-us ) being sold at all ** , otherwise the same broad mandatory privatization and [ extremely narrow exemptions ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) as gats applies . 
  # 4 since they refer to gats rules , it goes ** country by country ** so nothing said about any other country matters as to what is included or exempted , also gats which they refer to as their goal , [ states that the eventual goal is total privatization ] ( http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/gats_03_e.htm#comm ) . 
  # 5 since developed countries want access to developing markets , they want to have `` water '' ( bargaining chips ) in future ftas with india/china , they want those jobs to be `` in play '' . 
  as long as jobs remain tied up in public services they can not be traded for markets . 
  also , public services are not profitable . 
  too efficient . 
  they are protesting on principle because they want * the natural state of people 's bodies * to be legal . 
  i am 100 % supporting them on that . 
  that is the argument they should use . 
  the default should always be equality . 
  and legality . 
  default meaning - * the state we are born into . 
  * i think their point is basically that this is the natural state of the human body , and it should always be legal . 
  people should not be born into an illegal state . 
  ( nakedness ) if anything can be made illegal , it should never be that . 
  this is actually a really important thing . 
  seriously . 
  i think everybody is missing the point here completely . 
  lol , tax them to poverty ? 
  thats going to be like healthcare in the us , the tax to end all taxes . 
  do you think that the [ recently leaked ttip draft for chemicals sector ] ( http://www.ciel.org/chem/ttip_1oct2014.html ) reveals a toxic partnership ? 
  here , this has got a lot of data . . and its written by the iom , very high quality http://www.iom.edu/reports/2013/us-health-in-international-perspective-shorter-lives-poorer-health.aspx http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13497, 
  thats quite simply untrue . 
  for example , in achmea v. slovak republic '' [ arbitrators dismiss claims by dutch insurer , but investor says it has achieved goal ] ( http://www.iareporter.com/articles/20140523_3 ) of averting slovak nationalization and creation of single-payer health system '' see [ the actual case here ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) . 
  [ here is a primer on isds in ttip ] ( https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/edri_isds_answeringguide.pdf ), 
  llanita , what gives you the idea that public health services would be excepted ? 
  you should know that its completely meaningless what conservative politicians in your country say , ( just as in mine - unfortunately , our current president is also a neoliberal and fundamentally dishonest about these things - in keeping them secret - whenever the string ttip goes into a title , legions of astroturfers jump into the fray , attempting to argue both sides of an issue , but they make very unconvincing arguments on the side they want to lose . . also , they attempt to reassure the public when the public should be angry . . with the intent of lulling all of us into inaction at the moments when we actually could have done or could do something . . know that ftas attempt to dismantle the ability of elections to change anything important . . [ such as laws on toxic chemicals , for example ] ( http://www.ciel.org/publications/toxicpartnership_mar2014.pdf ) . . 
  they are designed to be irreversible . 
  in my experience , they are never in the public interest . 
  for example , [ tisa - the services agreement ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ppqnbxpa4 ) which covers 50 countries , could massively increase globalization of all services employment (  60 % of all jobs ) and mandate massively increase privatization - because a safety net is really needed in the coming years , the neoliberals of the world , want to dismantle public healthcare - in 50 countries , the eu , us , and a bunch of others . 
  tisa is gats 2 . 
  gats , is the fta [ that is responsible for the existing privatizations ] ( http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/sites/thecornerhouse.org.uk/files/23gats.pdf ) of the nhs . 
  which have been going on for over a decade , because of it . . and it makes them irreversible when they occur . . 
  the fact that almost no britons even know that should tell you something . 
  well , i think its a bundle of the very worst economic and political ideas ever , wrapped up in mistruths , - do you think it is going to be beneficial in general ? 
  no , i think its quite deceptive , i think that these ftas represent an attack on the gains which were made in the latter part of the 20th century , and an attack on democratic rule of law by a few very large corporations . 
  i think they are being presented in an quite intentionally deceptive way , and the media has basically decided to not cover them intentionally , because the less people know the more likely they are to go along with them . 
  - or is it going to a threat for the sovereignty of european people ? 
  yes , and for the us too , thats their intent . 
  they are a power grab which attempts to put corporate interests above those of the people of the world . 
  isds is the worst but by no means the only example . 
  they claim that the goal is to privatize and that privatization is good , however its often a huge failure . 
  they attempt to make all privatizations one way and irreversible , which is a mistake that is often regretted . 
  they attempt to pretend that the lessons of the 2008 gfc never happened and continue with deregulation when deregulation in the financial context has proven to be the worst possible thing for the people of a great many countries . 
  they - meaning almost all ftas are really bad policy . 
  - do we have to worry just reading what have been already leaked ? 
  people should read other web sites ( a good place to start is http://bilaterals.org ) and documents because all ftas are intentionally written so as to be almost incomprehensible to normal people , also they reference one another so , when a person says `` well that wont be in xyz document '' that may technically be true , its just going to be in this other `` agreement '' that you do n't know about , old or new . 
  ( [ like tisa ] ( http://www.world-psi.org/sites/default/files/documents/research/report_tisa_eng_lr2.pdf ) , which is almost completely unknown ) additionally , their fta goals , their `` value system '' is at best amoral and backwards to what most people think of as good and bad . . 
  this document is a [ good short introduction ] ( http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/nafta.pdf ) to some of them . 
  its about a us-canada fta which was the prototype of a great many others ( the other similar prototype is gats ) they are not most peoples goals nor are they the goals of the electorate in any country . 
  they are an under the radar coup . 
  - what is the coverage of the demonstrations , if any , in your country ? 
  zero .
