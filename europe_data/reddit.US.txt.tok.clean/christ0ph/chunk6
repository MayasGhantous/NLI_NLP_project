  months go by that not a single story is published in the mainstream media . 
  when i try to tell people about the existence of these ftas , people - since they have never heard of them , think i am lying . 
  - are there a huge movement in your country ? 
  no , as i said , the government and media are going to great lengths to prevent most people ( meaning 99.99 % ) from even knowing about them . 
  a previous `` free trade '' `` agreement '' , gats , [ is the reason ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) why us health care is so horribly bad . 
  ultimately , the goal is to make european healthcare as profitable - and the ftas [ make any change towards `` liberalisation '' ( privatization ) irreversible . . ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20140329000158/http://boell.org/downloads/hbs-ttip_2.pdf ) but , nobody here in the us realizes that , which is what they want . 
  that way , politicians can make vague promises which they have no intention of keeping - and get away with it . 
  * meanwhile , everybody with a brain in the country moves somewhere else . 
  * oops !,

  ( # 1 ) the insane cost of going to the hospital and doctor in the us , and ( # 2 ) the effect of 20 + years of higher environmental standards in the eu must have something to do with it . .

  what is their rationale for `` taxing the internet '' ? 
  that strikes me as * monumentally * stupid . 
  i do n't live there , so , i have no idea , to be honest with you . 
   * `` is it possible that there never was a russian sub ? 
  american ? 
  but its too small . 
  also , - excuse me for asking , but - does n't sweden have those areas wired with sensors of some kind ? 
  i would expect them to . 
  given their geography . 
  i think its more likely its swedish than american . 
  follow the money . 
  maybe some swedish defense contractor . 
  do n't the pending ftas have lots of special perks for defense contractors ? 
  ( exemptions from international services procurement rules ) so to keep jobs will need more paranoia/secrecy . 
  whose else would it be ? 
  supposedly it has to be small . 
  the `` whiskey on the rocks '' incident, 
  one thing that has to be said about this specific situation is that the topology of the stockholm area makes it exceedingly difficult to find a hidden sub in . 
  its among the worst places on earth actually for that . 
  its an archipelago of islands , narrow bays and inlets , however in most of those bays and inlets the water is quite deep . 
  so one would think they should have maintained this capability and not sold it off !, 
  the economies in the developed world are slowing down because of exponential growth in technology . 
  it is making it easier and easier to run businesses without many people . 
  that said , businesses need customers . 
  many are increasingly looking to the developing countries for growth - their markets . 
  please be a bit more specific , because that does n't sound like the experiences ive heard . 
   `` my family member has a * very * rare disease . '', 
  `` the nhs will only provide the treatment she is getting if her disease becomes life threatening . '', 
  that sounds like bs to me , because the nhs is very good with things like that . 
   the kicker is , the treatment is what prevents that . 
  it is expensive , she always meets her out of pocket maximums , but it beats dying or spending your life bed ridden . 
  i have lots of experience with bureaucracies and lots of experience with hmos and also lots of experience with astroturf and their smear campaigns , and that sounds a ** lot ** more like a us hmo than the uk 's nhs . 
  thats good but at the same time , * i can not overestimate how much the health care situation in the us is keeping americans who would like to return home , away . 
  the healthcare situation gets brought up all the time . 
  two that i know have moved back . 
  i know what my friends who are expats tell me . 
  and i know a lot of them . 
  they are worried about health care in the us . 
  they get decent healthcare where they are and they are afraid of us health care . 
  and they have every reason to be afraid . 
  how many americans are living outside of the us right now ? 
  a lot . 
  a lot . . look at costa rica , for example . . 
  ask those people why they moved . 
  i ca n't believe that you , as a us expat , are asking that question .

  i have no `` plan '' . 
  i do n't think we should make a huge and dangerous proposed change , irreversibly . 
  are you aware of the ttip fracking / lng export deal which would lift the 45 year old bar on us lng exports ? 
  the secret backroom deal to [ suddenly start selling us lng globally ] ( http://action.sierraclub.org/site/docserver/analysis_of_eu_energy_proposal_ttip.pdf?docid=15744 ) will be a huge mistake . 
  i would like the us to not make that mistake . 
  i think that the evidence is far stronger that a sudden jump in us energy prices ( heating and electricity ) would `` collapse growth '' . 
  the wise thing would be to leave that energy in the ground as a hedge against possible future needs , the possible occurrences which i just enumerated . 
  another danger is a volcanic eruption , such as the one in 1783 in iceland which caused a year of abnormally low sunlight and cold . 
  reduced light means less solar power and less wind , as well as a higher need for alternative sources of energy . 
  ( other than solar which would be significantly reduced . 
  wind might be reduced too by reduced solar radiation . ), 
  but , nuclear fission has the waste heat / solar storm issue . 
  coal has a particulates , co2 and mercury issue . 
  nuclear fusion is decades away from being available . 
  and we have this huge question mark , will the big drought in the southwest continue , if it does , we 're going to have to figure out a way to get literally millions of people and hundreds of thousands of farms , desalinated seawater or water shipped from other parts of the country . 
  i think this is quite debatable because fracked gas , tar sands , etc , has a huge cost compared to other forms of energy - both in methane and other pollutants and in energy required to extract it . 
  additionally , the huge drought in the us southwest , if it continues , will eat up a lot of that energy because it will require pumping water long distances - or giving up on entire sections of the country , which is politically impossible . 
  lacking a affordable source of energy , would create a real disaster at that point . 
  i think the us should take steps to make sure that should that happen , we are ready . 
  there also is an issue involving solar storms risk to the energy grid and especially nuclear power plants . 
  google `` loss of the ultimate heat sink '' . 
  however , the possibility of a `` superdrought '' - an extended period of drought is the most important issue near term . 
  historically , every few hundred years there appears to be a quite long extended period of drought in the southwest . 
  that is completely independent of climate change . 
  its part of the normal climate variability picture . 
  at some times , for example , the 13th century , two long periods of almost no rainfall were connected by a period of below average rainfall . 
  mobile homes . 
  and it is some huge number . 
  i also said nobody knows the actual number . 
  most of those people maintain a po box or something ( oftentimes they get mail forwarded to them by their children ) in their former location . 
  a lot of people also live outside the us . 
  millions of americans have fled the us because of the health care system . 
  they leave because they know that if hey get sick in the us , its likely to take everything they have , even if they have insurance . 
  so , they have left until things change . 
  but of course , tisa , ttip , tpp are designed to make the one thing that they need to be able to return , public health care , impossible . 
  many of them are in warmer climates , places like costa rica have huge american populations . . also there is a very large diaspora in the eu . 
  many of those people would like to return home but ca n't because of the healthcare situation . 
  do you know much about recent chinese history ? 
  if you did you would realize that they have had very bad times in the recent past . 
  wwii , was bad but the really worst disaster for china was in the late 1950s and early 1960s the `` great leap forward '' period especially was the time of an unbelievably bad famine in china . 
  what 's been happening in the us and in europe too , apparently , is all that money that should have been poured into educating the workforce for the future ( which means technology skills ) was instead given to the wealthy . 
  so now we are looking at an unmitigated disaster of low skill work force meets future unprepared for remaining employed .
