  what do you mean by `` chinese stores '' chinese food stores ? 
  other stores operated by chinese people ? 
  if i were you , i would focus on labor conditions and leave ethnicity out of it . 
  if there are abusive labor conditions anywhere , to anybody , that is an issue . 
  also , its wrong to give any group preferential treatment with one exception which i think the ftas are being insane to eliminate . 
  i think that governments should be able to give unemployed people both training and jobs . 
  in the us in the 30s , the government put millions of unemployed to work building a national infrastructure . 
  by making that impossible , the ftas are dooming a lot of countries to economic disaster . 
  also , governments should be able to have farmers markets that sell exclusively local , say , organically grown products . . 
  restrictions against local sourcing in some contexts are unnatural and wrong . 
  because goods coming from other lands have a hidden cost in the transport . 
  even if boats are traveling mostly empty in one direction and transport is very cheap , its still a cost . . 
  there are several large asian grocery stores near me and they are good places to shop because they have good produce deals ( i am american and they are too - as are the farmers , typically asian american family operations - all their produce is grown in the us - pretty much , and they have a mind blowing variety of foods from around the world but now almost all also ` made in the us ' ) and they are quite large - as in huge - one of these stores must be one of the biggest food ( chain ) stores in the us-and well stocked , as well as being cheap . 
  i think that by and large they are a big plus , not a minus . 
  i really , really doubt if they mistreat their employees . 
  their employees look well paid . . 
  probably as well paid or better paid than employees of the more traditional us food chains . 
  however , i do n't live in the city any more . 
  when i did live in the city i shopped at smaller asian food stores often too and there , the stores were usually family operations with entire families working there . 
  they were n't abusive families they were tightly knit families . 
  they were people you would see around , walking their dogs , on the bus , etc. 
  part of the community . 
  they were n't there to not assimilate , the younger members of families did assimilate quite well . 
  i live in the us , and we have the italian and chinese communities to thank for giving americans a re-introduction to a lot of good foods which the us had lost touch with . 
  were it not for italians and chinese restaurants ( the most popular ) and their creative use of vegetables , through a long period of generally bland us cuisine , we would be eating far worse than we are now . 
  they literally re-introduced the country to vegetables as important . 
  i was n't trying to be smug . 
  i 'm sorry , looking at my comment , i see it looked smug . 
  i have been through things like that . 
  i know how hard it is on people . 
  the problem and also the opportunity is technology . 
  its replacing a lot of jobs and that will mean massive changes . 
  nobody knows what we can do when we have a world where few people `` need to work '' ( except of course , for money ... ) that fact underlies all the acts of the global elites . 
  they are trying to get rid of safety nets precisely because they know they are needed more and more now . 
  the rate of change is increasing exponentially . 
  lots of europeans have moved to south america, 
   * nobody knows how many , actually . 
  * a lot . 
  is this a covert attempt * to make research results only available to students ? 
  there 's  25 million people living in cars or other vehicles in the us !, 
  nobody knows how many , actually . 
  a lot . 
  if russia were to stop invading european countries there would be zero risk of a conflict with the us . 
  the us would never want to attack russia itself to hold it , ( what would/could we do with it !? 
  that would be nuts . ), 
  the entire problem should be obvious to anybody who knows the history of russian involvement in europe . 
  eastern europeans must have a right to do what they want . 
  ** the postwar division of europe ( and the subsequent division of asian countries along the same model ) at the yalta conference was a huge mistake , one which that region is still paying for today in terms of stability . 
  ** if there is one lesson to be learned its that the people of a country should determine its government themselves . 
  philip morris asia limited v . the commonwealth of australia `` indirect expropriation '' `` investor-state dispute settlement '' http://bilaterals.org collects resources on isds . 
  here is a case you should read that is relevant to the uk http://www.italaw.com/cases/2564, 
  if americans knew what was being done in our names , we would not want europeans to end up in [ the situation we are in today ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/us/drive-by-doctoring-surprise-medical-bills.html ) . 
  i was watching the british house of lords yesterday and i was appalled at the - i dont know , - be aware that cameron is lying through his teeth about the nhs . 
  of course privatized health care is going to cost more , it always does . 
  its a black hole of corruption and waste . . public health care works , and it saves money , which is why the obama closet neoliberals , the us gop and your tories feel they need to kill it . 
  you have the `` vote of no confidence '' , use it, 
  this is good news !, 
  these mini subs are about the same size as north korean semi submersible craft . 
  they do n't look as fast above water . . 
  the key i suspect is educational level , also wealth does not necessarily equal or even map that closely to quality of life or happiness , unless people are both poor and can not get essentials like health care , housing or education . 
  a little bit more money is never going to matter if people get cancer at a young age or can not get the education they need to get and keep a job , which is increasing very rapidly . 
  in 20 years , some huge percentage of what people do today for work will be automated . 
  so people will need a good education to be able to absorb the news skills they will need to be able to work . 
  education is everything . 
  although there are simpler ways to know when satellites are overhead , i highly recommend using the wxtrack program because its got a lot of great features which makes its use a real pleasure . . 
  i dont use windows but i often run wine so that i can use wxtrack ( it also has a bunch of special iss-communications related features which i have n't used yet . 
  some of them may require purchasing it . 
  but they really are for very advanced users . 
  for example , people whose job it is to work as part of the project use it . 
  its used in displays at the various space centers . ), 
  its free to use for non-commercial purposes . 
  its the best satellite tracking program i know of . 
  it works great under wine on both osx and linux . 
  http://satsignal.eu/software/wxtrack.htm people can also sometimes listen to the iss with a $ 12 / r/rtlsdr dvb-t tv dongle - * if you live in the eu , may even already own one !, 
  the iss makes me think there still is hope for the human race to move beyond our troubled adolescence into our adulthood in space , together . 
  how democratic is the eu central government right now , and does it reflect values of the decider is a better question . 
  the ftas do n't reflect democratic values . 
  i am really disappointed in both my own government and the eu for pushing the highly undemocratic ftas and trying to hide the implications of things like isds - their hidden goal of covertly privatizing most services is the worst aspect of them . 
  the eu and usa government policies should stand for democracy , not the antidemocratic corporatism of ttip/tisa/ceta / etc. 
  people should know that if you have even a fairly common pair of * high power * binoculars or a good spotting scope , or a long lens for your camera ( `` 400 mm '' ) with a tripod , * you can actually see the shape of the iss * - you can see what it is , if you catch it shortly before sunrise or shortly after sunset . 
  ( the times when the contrast is the best ) seriously , you can see its shape , what it looks like . . easily . 
   you said it could be `` easily '' shown the country could not afford the insurance , yet they bought it anyway . 
  ** the people voted to end ** the country 's use of private insurance in 2006 . 
  people should know that a russian submarine captain probably saved the world from wwiii by disobeying orders given to him by moscow during the cuban missile crisis . 
  see http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsaebb/nsaebb75/ http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/index.htm he had previously been on a sub that suffered a nuclear accident and had seen several of his ship mates die agonizing deaths from radiation sickness . 
  that 's why he held back . 
  the world has come very close to nuclear war a number of times . 
  we are all very lucky to still be here . 
  nuclear weapons and the concept of winning any kind of nuclear war are insanity . 
  you 're confusing the mycaeneans ( hundreds of years later , much more war-like , and related to proto-greek cultures ) to the minoans ( that 's a very common mistake ) actually , the minoan `` linear a '' script , as far as i know , even though some of its characters may have been borrowed from for mycaenean script ( linear b ) - and also then incorporated into greek , * is unrelated to any other written language * and it remains undeciphered . . 
  i am pretty sure . . ( this period of history - and the minoan - a largely unknown , advanced proto-mediterranean culture , is pretty interesting , imo . . wish i had more time to dig into it a bit more deeply . ),

  did you read [ gats and public service systems ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) ? 
  i can see some countries where investors really do need very strong protections against expropriation if they have indeed invested a very large amount of money in building some kind of physical infrastructure . 
  but what about a case like achmea b.v. v . the slovak republic i and ii ? 
  there it can easily be shown that the country could not afford the insurance system , and at the same time pay doctors and nurses a living wage . 
  but they are still being forced to keep it .
