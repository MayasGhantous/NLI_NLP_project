  santorini was the spot of a huge volcanic eruption in 1700 bc which spelled the end of the minoan civilization . 
  ( and which really changed the mediterranean for 1000 years , ushering in a long period of upheaval ) the eruption and its aftermath were to become the basis for the plagues of egypt in the old testament of the bible . 
  the disaster clearly must have been the origin of the atlantis myth [ recounted by plato in critias ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantis#critias ) ( it was also recorded in chinese history [ as a time of famine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minoan_eruption#chinese_records ) ) it was one of the biggest events in ancient history . 
  your statement seems very wrong in the light of actual practice . 
  for example , here is a case which you might bring up to say that slovakia won , but if you dug a bit deeper you would find that they had actually lost , because they lost a previous case where an insurer claimed their passing a law that limited their profits to 20 % was expropriation , and won then , and in the second case , only lost [ because they sued them too early , before they had actually implemented to affordable healthcare law . 
  ] ( http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf ) more like a fairy tale for the gullible . 
  how can you argue for a system that freezes a country 's abilities to adjust to changes ? 
  if `` investors '' can not deal with that they should stay at home . 
  [ these things should be dumped ] ( http://www.bilaterals.org/?the-arbitration-game ) . 
  at this point it is mostly the us and uk governments that are pushing them and they are looking like they are out of touch with public opinion in the real world . 
  the only way that they have been able to avoid a huge public outcry in the us is by going to great lengths to hide their true nature from the public . 
  you know its true . 
   * `` len mccluskey , the secretary general of unite , the trade union , told ibtimes uk : `` karel de gucht has confirmed that isds , the mechanism that allows corporations to sue national governments for billions , is at the very heart of these talks . 
  this underlines the fact that this secretive deal is a massive danger to our nhs , and threatens to make the tory 's sell-off irreversible . 
  '' * mr. mc cluskey should read up on gats , the ( wto ) general agreement on trade in services , which was signed in 1995 , and it 's `` standstill '' which makes `` liberalization '' one way only . 
  https://www.google.com/search?q=gats+privatiztion+irreversible similar language is in the recently released ttip `` mandate '' but these facts are being hidden . 
  some good comments on the problems here : https://www.citizen.org/documents/public-citizen-comments-on-international-services-agreement.pdf, 
  do you have any examples ? 
   * `` to regulate for the common good , i.e. 
  education , health , environment , etc. 
  '' * do you see how a commitment to privatize virtually everything in the future and always procure using a globalized procurement system that could not `` discriminate '' by hiring local firms , could have a chilling effect on a country 's ability to respond to something like a major economic crisis ? 
  this is heartbreaking, 
  this is an interesting story of a previous incident . . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_submarine_s-363, 
  priceless, 
  and he [ described to the eu parliament ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwryywn7beo ) in a very human , real manner , that linus had been unable to deny that nsa had approached him in some way .

  for inland, 
  the hot springs back then were great . . 
  it is under the lake now . . 
  i used to go there with friends it was free and totally natural . . 
  it was really nice to lie in the hot pools , then come out and get covered up with mud , and let it dry in the sun . . really pulls the bad things out of your body . . its really a healing kind of thing . 
  this was not sludge , it was clean clay mud . . you could sell it for beauty treatments or make pots out of it . . there were different colors . . 
  anyway , pleasant memories of many years ago . 
  i 've been there . . 
  in fact an old friend of mine lives there . 
  i like it around there . . did you ever go to the old dry creek hot springs where lake sonoma is now ?

  which is worse ? 
  it seems as if the 3 secret ftas all keep trying to out-do-on-evil one another . 
  it looks like the russian presence in california ended in the 19th century http://www.parks.sonoma.net/rosshist.html, 
  it would be smart to read these statements in a very critical way . 
  for example , juncker 's definition of isds , what is it ? 
  also why are people assuming ttip has anything to do with public service privatization ( mandatory liberalisation/globalization of procurements of all kinds , the putting out for global bidding on contracts that come up ) that kind of thing will likely be in tisa , services represent an awfully large number of jobs which can be used to show that the developed countries are serious about giving the developing world some benefits from globalization . . 
  here are some criticisms of tisa , the 50 nation trade in services agreement http://www.citizen.org/documents/public-citizen-comments-on-international-services-agreement.pdf, 
  from : http://www.citizen.org/documents/public-citizen-comments-on-international-services-agreement.pdf ... . a positive list approach must be used for any commitments made under the isa . 
  regardless of the rules of the agreement , each negotiating party must maintain the prerogative to name the specific sectors that it intends to bind to such rules , whether concerning market access or national treatment . 
  a positive list approach better equips negotiators to exclude those sectors that are particularly sensitive as non-negotiable domestic priorities , such as energy , water , etc. 
  in addition , a positive list approach allows countries to maintain the policy space to implement future regulations to respond to crises ( e.g. 
  climate change , financial instability ) or respond to newly created services ( e.g. 
  the emergence of derivatives ) . 
  we urge ustr to reconsider the negative list approach for national treatment currently supported by ustr . 
  this is especially critical if the gats terms will be the basis for commitments in an isa , as the gats national treatment provisions require not only equal treatment , but also specify that `` [ f ] ormally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of the member compared to like services or service suppliers of any other member . '' 2 a limitless number of facially neutral regulatory policies , designed with no intent to discriminate , could alter the conditions of competition based on the business decisions of foreign firms . 
  this is an intolerable limitation on the prerogatives of congress and state legislatures to regulate the service sector in the public interest . 
  public services must be excluded from the agreement with a broad and authentic carve - out . 
  gats ' current `` exception '' for public services only excludes government services that are `` supplied neither on a commercial basis nor in competition with one or more service suppliers . '' 3 however , most government services ( like water , electricity , health care and education ) involve some public/private mix or fee structure and/or compete with private providers . 
  such sensitive sectors fall outside of this exception and thus are subject to gats ' deregulatory rules . 
  instead , the isa should include an unconditional carve-out for public services . 
  the agreement must include an effective general exception for public interest policies that excludes the self-defeating language of the gats article xiv `` exception . '' of the 35 times in which wto members have attempted to use the gats article xiv exception or the related general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) article xx exception to defend a policy measure , only one attempt has succeeded . 
  the rest have failed on one of three threshold tests required by the gats and gatt general exceptions .4 included in this 97 percent failure rate is the failure of the united states to defend its anti-internet gambling laws against a challenge from antigua and barbuda , which the wto has now authorized to sell $ 21 million worth of u.s. copyrighted material in retaliation . 
  in this case , and in many of the other failed attempts to apply the exception , the chapeau of the gatt and gats exceptions was the basis for the failure . 
  the isa presents an opportunity to design a general exception with a broader scope covering emerging issues , such as consumer data privacy and anti-abuse language that is more narrowly crafted so that it can adequately safeguard existing and proposed public interest policies . 
  ------ 4 of the 35 cases , the general exception was determined to be relevant enough to be considered in 27 cases . 
  twenty - six of those 27 cases failed to satisfy one of the three threshold tests required for application of the general exception . 
  two cases failed on the subject matter/scope threshold , with a tribunal concluding that the respondent failed to show that the measure was designed for the protection of human health or for securing compliance with laws or regulations which were not inconsistent with wto provisions . 
  eighteen cases failed on the `` necessary '' or `` related to '' threshold . 
  six cases failed on the chapeau threshold , with a tribunal finding arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination in the measures ' application . 
  try it now .

  do you see why these '' [ trojan horse clauses ] ( http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1264&amp;context=matthew_rimmer ) '' are problematic ? 
  you know that the eu just approved an fta with singapore - with isds, 
  okay , to answer your question , i need you to tell me , *** what exactly is isds , as defined by juncker ? 
  not at the rate we are going now . 
  there 's no time to waste , because they are pushing these ftas based on intentionally wildly wrong assumptions about the future job market . 
  the fact is , the rate of increase in technological growth makes any sweeping changes to `` liberalise markets '' a net negative for jobs . 
  basically , jobs are going to continue to vanish at an ever increasing rate and we should be honest about that fact or we will be making all the wrong decisions , which is what some powers that be want . 
  whatever growth occurs , the powers that be seem to be betting it will be in the developing world , not in the us or eu . 
  * they want more leverage in getting their firms , not workers , into those markets * and the only thing that they can trade under the current system will be jobs . 
  other people 's jobs . 
  the `` race to the bottom '' . 
  these `` agreements '' are hostile to the core concepts which civil society is built upon , such as democracy . 
  they repeatedly attempt to set up traps to steal important policy space from the unwary nations that sign them . 
  in order so that people like you could assert that they were harmless , they make statements which are intentionally ambiguous - but then their ambiguities have been interpreted in the ways least favorable to the public interest and most favorable to corporations , and as such are attempts to defraud society of its right to self governance . 
  they do not serve the public interest as they are being written today . 
  they take far more from society than they could ever give back . 
  so , what can we do ? 
  because underneath it all what 's really happening is machines are doing more and more and we 're in a global race to the bottom . 
  [ read the crtitique of tisa here . 
  ] ( http://www.citizen.org/documents/public-citizen-comments-on-international-services-agreement.pdf ) note that services are more likely to be in tisa . 
  not ttip . 
  if you ca n't see why i do n't trust you and your ilk , thats not my problem . 
  trust you , you 're an expert , eh ? 
  ever see the old shell game ? 
  welcome to trade deal shell game . 
   * `` the reason why people do n't fight is not because people are too comfortable , but too strained ; student loans , stagnant wages , increasing cost of health care are all strains on people . 
  '' * this is very true , and its also a good reason why , on some issues , folks on / r/europe should realize that some of us from the us are trying to help europe avoid some of what 's happened here . 
  it seems that many of you do n't understand what 's at stake for you . 
  you 'll understand it better if they eliminate your safety net . 
  which they are intending to do , nothing less . 
  if any `` regulatory convergence '' happens it should be in the direction of the world becoming more prudent in its policies , and not converging on a race to the bottom .
