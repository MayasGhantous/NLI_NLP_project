  there are probably a dozen closely related clauses in ftas that all have similar effects . 
  i guarantee you that this - its guaranteed to be a scam . 
  people who have never dealt with compulsively dishonest people or organizations do n't have a clue about these kinds of people , they are lucky . 
  they do n't ever tell the truth , they ca n't because most people 's heads would literally explode to realize how much they have been lied to , for so long . 
  truth is not in their vocabulary . 
  people soup !, 
  thank you , this is very interesting . 
  however , i wanted to also bring up the recent incident with the building which was allegedly `` accidentally built without an adequate elevator '' . . but googling , it appears this is a * controversy * now !, 
  who to believe ?

  it quietly forces privatization on europe and the us against their will , covertly by including the truly horrible [ 90s era wto gats fta ] ( http://policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/facing-facts ) by reference - which [ tries to conceal by calculated ambiguity ] ( https://www.princeton.edu/jpia/past-issues-1/2006/8.pdf ) , endorsement of an [ endpoint of near total privatization of public services ] ( http://www.iatp.org/files/gats_and_public_service_systems.htm ) , a radical privatization of services , as its goal , including [ health care ] ( http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/national_office_pubs/putting_health_first.pdf ) and education , despite the fact that very few people would choose that outcome if they knew this . 
  [ tisa , which is in the wings ] 9http : / / corporateeurope.org/blog/342-civil-society-groups-oppose-deregulation-and-privatisation-proposed-services-agreement-tisa ) , attempts to privatize and globalize services in ( to start ) 50 countries - it will likely attempt to then use the service jobs as `` water '' trading leverage which means that many jobs will almost certainly be used in a sense as bargaining chips in globalization , at least thats what ive been told will probably happen . 
  as bait to bring developing countries into the system . 
  i suspect thats a big part of the reason why they seem to really want to [ privatize education ] ( http://www.ei-ie.org/en/news/news_details/2659 ) - the jobs have to be privatized first . 
  chemicals - ttip eliminates the pesky precautionary principle and [ imposes the concept of `` innocent until proven guilty '' into the area of [ chemical regulation ] ( http://libcloud.s3.amazonaws.com/93/c7/2/3299/ciel_submission_on_ttip_sentate_finance_committee_hearing-clean.pdf ) , which is in my opinion a really bad policy ] ( http://www.ciel.org/publications/toxicpartnership_mar2014.pdf ) - the eu 's current precautionary principle , makes far more sense . . for the us to adopt the precautionary principle , and attempt to catch up with our 20 year backlog of chemicals which need to be regulated more would be much safer . 
  we particularly need more attention paid to the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals ... 
  must see this web site : http://www.theworstroom.com note that all those castles must cost a * huge amount to heat and maintain * . 
  it could easily cost several hundred thousand dollars a year just keeping them from falling into disrepair . 
  neoliberalism is exactly that.a deal with the devil , because it puts profit above the public interest , and to get the highest profits it worships inequality , i.e. 
  power , above all else . 
  its another power mad ideology . 
  its not something that won , freedom won in the 90s , not capitalism . 
  neo-liberalism is way beyond capitalism , its a power grab . 
  much more like fascism - but similar to communism too in that all radical ideologies are dangerous . 
  its true agenda is being hid , its a radical increase in inequality to counter the influence of automation and the abundance and potential freedom from drudgery it creates for society . 
  btw , stalin was clearly insane . 
  a madman , he killed everybody who questioned him , even his own family . 
  he killed all of the old communists too . 
  the video is really good . 
  watch it . 
  the problem is , russia still has n't fully put the past behind them . 
  they are backsliding . 
  wow, 
  millions of people were killed by stalin . 
  back in the 90s i read this article . 
  i remembered it the other day and looked it up . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/magazine/the-secret-of-a-siberian-river-bank.html?pagewanted=all the guy who managed the cover up of the bodies surfacing after the flood in the 1970s is now in the russian duma . 
  its easy to mislead with statistics . 
  really gorgeous work . 
  its so cool to see traditional styles done like that . 
  [ ttip ] ( http://www.bilaterals.org/?-ttip - ) is just half of a pair , the other side is tisa ( [ trade in services agreement ] ( http://www.world-psi.org/sites/default/files/documents/research/report_tisa_eng_lr2.pdf ) ) which will cover services and probably effect a lot more people 's workplaces . 
  [ public services ] ( http://www.world-psi.org/en/psi-special-report-tisa-versus-public-services ) , and the ( potentially millions ) of former public service jobs may be privatized irreversibly and then contracted out internationally . 
  the bear is a feeling animal and it is just beyond wrong to mistreat animals . 
  a big problem is presented by the current reversion back into a more repressive russia . 
  when perestroika came it was long overdue and it to some extent helped heal some major wounds which were the result of many decades of what can really be only described as genocide in some countries . 
  there was the `` holodomor '' in the ukraine that resulted in the deaths of millions of people from starvation . 
  there were horrible deportations of hundreds of thousands of eastern europeans to siberia , almost all of whom died , in the era between russia 's annexation of the baltics and hitler , and then , of course , hitler killed millions of eastern europeans and then , after he was defeated , and after the war the slaughter resumed . 
  so its not just about putin , its about the very very well justified fear in eastern europe , which can not be described adequately in words , that russia is capable of any kind of barbarity - due to its past . 
  because people are still alive who remember stalin and the terror . 
  i posted two links a bit lower , please scroll down . . the second one in particular leads to a web site about the legacy of the stalin era in estonia . 
  the ( other ) web site that i have bookmarked in russia that has a large body of material about the victims of the nkvd and kgb is not working for me right now . 
  not a good sign . 
  the magic of natural refrigeration . 
  of course its not your fault .

  the un is not some kind of beacon of enlightenment . 
  its far better than * nothing * , though . 
  the un is perpetually underfunded . 
  the whole ngo thing is not really working . 
  grant funding of ngos poisons their ability to take controversial positions . 
  you want to know the truth . 
  a lot of ngos are not helping the problems they profess to want to solve . 
  if their survival depends on a problem , they may become covertly unwilling to ever actually help solve it . 
  < sarcasm  they are not the only ones with hidden agendas , of course , many governments are even worse ! < / sarcasm , 
  the bottom line is , governments that have these issues and their successors , even after there have been shifts in form of political systems or whatever , almost always have numerous `` apparatchiks '' who were also associated with the previous regime ( and for many other reasons ) , they as far as i know , ** never ** want to face their pasts honestly so investigations are ** always ** a cooperative effort on the part of the ** global ** community . 
  in fact , its essential . 
  edit : just on a hunch i googled one of the names in that article . . a person involved in the 1979 cover up of the river bank incident is apparently in the russian duma now . 
  reminds me of the '' ** national city lines ** '' privatization disasters in the us ( or how the us went from having the best public transit in the developed world to the worst in only 30 years ), 
  every time there is a heavy rain in some areas of russia , bodies emerge . 
  decomposed bodies . 
  lots of them . 
  from the stalin era . 
  ask them what their hidden agenda is . 
  if you dare . 
  here in the us , former congresspeople and senators commonly make huge amounts of money , in some cases , millions of dollars a year working as lobbyists for the industries they had just been regulating . 
  we call it `` the revolving door '' . 
  no , i think you are showing yourself to be a fool for not seeing that they would never go to all this trouble to hide them and split them up into pieces , which are only revealed little bit by little bit , give them intentionally similar names , etc. 
  if i was wrong . 
  consider the [ health care situation in the us ] ( http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/nick%20skala%20gat%20and%20health%20reform.pdf ) , how much money is lost to each of us in america , due to our country being hijacked into the most expensive possible health care imaginable . 
  what is the effect on poorer americans . 
  water is a similar issue . 
  people literally can not live without water . 
  in other words , its potentially more valuable than gold . 
  gats is being used just as a trap would be , to privatize water services all around the world . 
  this is excerpted from : ** the wto 's threats to global water security : the general agreement on trade in services and beyond ** from ifg.org url : http://204.200.203.35/pdf/cancun/issues-wtowater.pdf ** forced water privatization : the general agreement on trade in services ( gats ) ** the gats takes the decision of whether or not to privatize water services , and under what conditions , out of the hands of communities and governments and puts it into the hands of the wto . 
  the gats is a liberalization agreement which applies to all government measures affecting services , including water , education , health care , social security , libraries and prisons . 
  the gats covers hundreds of types of water services -- sewer services , freshwater services , treatment of waste water , nature and landscape protection , construction of water pipes , waterways , tankers , groundwater assessment , irrigation , dams , bottled water , and water transport services , just to name a few . 
  the agreement requires that governments reduce their role in the provision and regulation of services as much as possible and increase the role of private companies . 
  no government measures affecting the trade in services , whatever its aim -- environmental or consumer protection , labor standards , universal service , fair competition , etc. -- is beyond gats scrutiny . 
  all signatories to the gats ( including the u.s. ) have already committed to move toward the privatization of their service industries . 
  through negotiations , including those in cancun , governments specify which of their own services will be liberalized and make requests of other nations . 
  the u.s. has not yet listed water services in its gats commitments ; however , the european union has speci\ufb01cally requested that the u.s. open its water services to for-pro\ufb01t water companies in its gats negotiating positions . 
  private ownership of once public water systems is one way that corporations are making steep pro\ufb01ts from water . 
  communities around the world are \ufb01ghting water privatization because of its devastating impact on consumers , workers and the environment . 
  for example : great britain : between 1989 ( when water was privatized ) and 1995 , there was a 106 percent increase in water prices in the uk , while pro\ufb01ts of the privatizing companies increased by 692 percent . 
  as a result of these price hikes , literally twice as many households had their water cut-off after privatization as were cut-off before . 
  in addition , the private companies \ufb01red almost 25 percent of the work force , approximately 100,000 workers . 
  finally , between 1989 and 1997 , \ufb01ve british water privatization companies were found guilty of 128 environmental offences . 
  cochabamba , bolivia : after privatizing the water systems in cochabamba , bolivia in 1999 , aguas del tunari , a subsidiary of the bechtel corporation , implemented massive price hikes . 
  families earning a minimum wage of $ 60 per month suddenly faced water bills of $ 20 per month .
