  the palestinian-israeli conflict . 
  internal iraq shia sunni conflicts . 
  iraqi and iranain war . 
  kuwaiti and iranian war . 
  the jasmine revolution . 
  sour saudi-iranain relations . 
  it 's not that we could n't be successful , but people do n't commit . 
  it 's like obama when he found our assad used chemical weapons . 
  he went to congress and emphasized how incredibly small this military intervention would be . 
  at which point it 's like , then why are we going ? 
  do we want to win , and end this once and for all ? 
  or are we going to keep posturing . 
  this `` there is no good option '' shit is an excuse . 
  there is a good option , people just do n't like the consequences that come with it . 
  too bad that not acting has its own consequences , sometimes even worse ones . 
  regardless of how you feel about the iraqi invasion , both in the early 90s and 2000s , pulling out without the job done was a mistake . 
  but people ca n't think beyond the tip of their noses , they see a few dead bodies and hear a few sob stories and scream war is bad . 
  well that 's just fine , but now how does that make you feel when the bodies are coming from your own back yard . 
  i guess keeping to yourself did n't work out so well , did it ? 
  especially in our hyper globalized economy -- this is what everyone advocates for . 
  this is what the eu is . 
  this is what nafta is . 
  and asean . 
  and opec . 
  but go ahead . 
  do n't listen to me , i 'm sure our strongly worded letter will just make everything disappear again . 
  or should i quote president obama about how this has `` somehow become routine '' . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're joking , but austria borders slovakia and slovenia . 
  it 's worth noting that even this is n't that black and white . 
  wikipedia seems to have [ conflicting information . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_metro_systems ) [ london 's opened in 1863 , according to wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_underground ) , maybe 1855 . 
  [ and new york 's kind of had an ambiguous start . 
  with developments/precursors as early as 1844 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_new_york_city_subway ) . 
  however , at-grade non-electric rapid transit was available in [ 1868 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_york_city_subway#cite_note-9 ) . 
  the concept of a metro did n't start off as `` lets build a metro ! '', 
  -- [ it was trial and error , before they switched to electricity , because people did n't like the smoke underground ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_rapid_transit ) , which is likely where these dates are from . 
  yes , it 's not british . 
  is n't hell supposed to be underground ? 
  older immigrants have a harder time learning languages . 
  to expect them to integrate fully is unrealistic . 
  younger ones will pick up german . 
  i mean , face it , if an anglophone moved even to one of the nordic countries : there would still be a sizeable amount of people who they would struggle to communicate with him/her . 
  that is a strong initiative , even if there will always be a few deadbeats . 
  the functioning language of germany is german , and people will follow that because they do n't want to lose opportunity and face social ostraciziation . 
  to think that arabic is going to take over german is far fetched . 
  and let 's pretend that it does ( which it would n't ) , why does it matter ? 
  whatever reason you come up with can be applied to a lot of other dying german dialects . 
  to the sami in the nordic counties . 
  or whatever . 
  it 's a destruction of culture , yes -- but things change : things are constantly changing . 
  change is n't always bad . 
  and as long as the principles which the people of germany decide on stay in tact , whatever they might be , then i do n't think it 's necessarily a problem . 
  i live in texas . 
  i 'm half mexican , half chinese . 
  i know both spanish and chinese . 
  and what you say is n't entirely untrue . 
  yeah they will form ghettos . 
  the same way many mexicans have here : who ca n't speak english and are locked in poverty . 
  but their children will speak english . 
  their children will be american , the same way those children will grow up german . 
  but in the long term , that barrier just disappears . 
  the same way how americans do n't know what european they are or whatever . 
  it stops mattering because they integrate . 
  it wo n't happen overnight , but the german language is not under assault from these people . 
  if anything , it might actually help it , since germany 's birth rate is n't the highest : and these people will learn german . 
  i do n't entirely agree , but i do n't think it 's a bad idea in practice . 
  so germany has a lot of arabs , it 's only natural to facilitate communication . 
  the same way many of the american border states end up teaching spainish . 
  you can make the argument they do n't integrate either , see as how there are definitely regions in texas and new mexico in particular where the mexican culture is overwhelmingly strong . 
  i do n't think arabic will necessarily be useful , because i do n't see a strong economic outlook for the time being in those nations . 
  but things change quickly , and people are n't giving you enough credit for that . 
  they own a sizeable amount of the world , and they 're not going anywhere . 
  chinese is near impossible to learn for a westerner if the will power is n't there . 
  this is n't like picking up german or french where half the words are the same . 
  so i do n't know how feasible that is . 
  i think what his point was was that these people probably are n't really that far right . 
  they may have a far-right belief . 
  but as far as the dissolution of the swedish welfare system , economic policy , or even women 's rights etc. 
  -- they 're probably not that `` far-right '' . 
  i say this being pretty leftist on immigration policy within the us , while maintaining what most of reddit would see as rightist values . 
  the google document clearly states : prefer not to answer : 4.9 % high school or less : 30.6 % apprenticeship : 3 % baccalaureate program or associates degree : 21.4 % bachelor 's degree : 24.3 % masters degree : 13.3 % doctorate : 2.5 % so , yeah -- the majority ( or plurality -- the more precise term ) have a high school degree or less . 
  edit : expanding on this . 
  that is about 60 % which do n't have a 4-year degree . 
  and while that certainly does n't mean the rest are stupid ( once again , i 'm not saying this ) -- there * is * a degree of maturity , and changes in perception that come with both being older and more educated . 
  whether or not they intend to complete said degree is irrelevant , because it 's not like it magically makes these users less educated or older just because they will be older or more educated in life . 
   my point is n't just that you are being harsh . 
  that 's fine . 
  my point is that you are being unreasonably and unfairly harsh . 
  ... what ? 
  that does n't even make sense . 
  define unreasonable first . 
  you do n't like what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm sorry , that does n't mean i 'm being `` unreasonably harsh '' . 
   it 's not as diverse as the true european population thus , it is more ... homogeneous . 
  just the gender statistic in and of itself : 90 % male makes that painfully obvious . 
  why should n't i be harsh ? 
   there is a large range of users yes . 
  so there 's the word `` large '' . 
  less than 3 % were over the age of 40 . 
  almost 80 % were under 30 .
