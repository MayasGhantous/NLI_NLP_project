you 're under arrest for insulting a foreign quasi-dictator . 
   there is not a black white democracy or not . 
  hey , we tried that one . 
  it did n't go so well . 
  we 're just more polite than our foreign policy lets on . 
  is that a fisheye lens , panorama , or just a really awkwardly shaped room ? 
   you 'd take down a statue of stalin , would n't you ? 
  today ? 
  no , probably not . 
  anything that 's stood for the past 25 years probably has historic significance itself . 
  i 've seen several statues of depicting him from the yalta photographs , for example , which hardly seems offensive but i 've heard of calls for his removal in those depictions as well . 
  similarly , i would n't remove statues of robert e. lee or jefferson davis in the us , which are somewhat controversial , too . 
  nor would i remove statues of christopher columbus , who has also become controversial as well . 
  horatio nelson has been severely criticized for what happened in naples , yet he still stands at trafalgar , does he not ? 
  and what of jan van riebeeck , the statue that stands opposing cecil ? 
  surely the man who brought colonialism to south africa in the first place is equally to blame ? 
  removal just smacks of whitewashing . 
  leave the statue up . 
  teach people what he did . 
  a statue is not for honor . 
  it 's for memory . 
  the reality is that many historical figures are not black or white figures of good and evil . 
  they 're going to be shades of grey , because that 's what humans are . 
   well , exactly . 
  he repented for wrongdoing . 
  no , he did n't want to be remembered as a `` merchant of death '' . 
  that does n't mean he was repentant , just that did n't want to be remembered * infamously * . 
  presumably cecil rhodes felt exactly the same . 
  he wanted to be remembered as someone who enabled people to be educated . 
  you can see that in his will :  cecil rhodes ' goals in creating the rhodes scholarships were to promote civic-minded leadership among young people with ( in the words of his 1899 will ) `` moral force of character and instincts to lead '' , and ( as he wrote in a 1901 codicil to his will ) to help `` render war impossible '' through promoting understanding between the great powers . 
  -- [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhodes_scholarship ) wow , what an asshole , right ? 
  in the 1980s and 1990s , bill gates was one of the most vilified executives for unscrupulous business tactics . 
  make no mistake , what microsoft did was terrible . 
  most of what is listed [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criticism_of_microsoft ) comes from when he was in charge . 
  today , however , he 's going to be remembered as one of the men who beat polio . 
  there will be statues to this man across the world when he dies . 
  so , it 's far enough to be removed from his initial investment that it 's not his money , but not far enough to be removed from the man himself ? 
  is n't that a little absurd ? 
  why are n't people campaigning to eliminate alfred nobel 's name from his prize , then ? 
  that man set up his prizes * literally * to clear his name . 
  unless it went bankrupt , it is . 
  most funds survive by investing the initial endowment , and then paying the benefits and administrative costs based on the resulting income from that investment . 
  unless you want to argue that money you earn from investments is n't yours , this is still his money . 
  because compromising your principles undermines your arguments you make from a moral high ground . 
  beyond that , biting the hand that feeds you always looks a bit rude . 
  i suppose that explains the sufi dervishes . 
  i feel like `` economic situation '' is a [ spoiler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spoiler_effect ) on this survey . 
  `` unemployment , '' `` the state of member states ' public finances , '' `` rising prices/inflation/cost of living , '' and `` taxation '' seems to cover a pretty broad spectrum of economic issues already . 
  why is the fifth category such a general category then ? 
  i understand the question asked was pretty open , but it really skews the meaning of the results when we ca n't tell what `` economic situation '' means . 
  bmi would n't bother me so much if it did n't relate mass with the * square * of height . 
  bmi 25 is 200 lbs or 90 kg . 
  the only time in my adult life i weighed about that i was severely depressed and not eating . 
  you could count my ribs without me raising my arms , and my doctor threatened that they would put in a feeding tube if i did n't start gaining weight . 
  edit : y' all can hate , but it 's the truth . 
  i 've been 220-250 for the past 20 years , had doctors talk to me about bmi because my stats say i 'm overweight but i 'm not in appearance . 
  i 've had a body fat tests run , and they come back at about 15 % pretty consistently , and that 's healthy . 
  that does look remarkably like this comic . 
  german styling , italian reliability , french craftsmanship . 
  depends . 
  copyright typically protects against copying a work without the consent of the copyright owner . 
  in order to transmit a digital work online , you have to make a copy of it . 
  back in the early days of computing , there were discussions that running a program was technically violating copyright because it copied the program from the disk to memory . 
  it was exacerbated when hard disks came about and suddenly you were copying the program from the disk to your hard drive and then into memory . 
  the whole concept of an eula came up because of that . 
  they had to license the purchaser of the software with enough rights to make copies for the program to run . 
  only some eulas granted the right to make backups . 
  then why did you say :  it 's not exactly a finnish ** word ** and not :  it 's not exactly a ** finnish ** word, 
  words are allowed to have spaces in them without being idioms . 
  they 're called open compound words ( as opposed to hyphenated and closed compound words ) . 
  for example : butter knife , school bus , mobile phone , web browser , etc. 
  molotov cocktail , believe it or not . 
  well , if you ask him , at least . 
   as a brit , i ca n't fathom why that is so much of a deal . 
  because the boomers are getting old , and old people often have nothing to do other than pine for the good old days , police the behavior of everyone around them , and vote . 
  ha , ha , ha , do n't be silly . 
  they want to get to romania , belarus , and ukraine . 
  or finns want a land route to eastern europe without paying russian import duty and taxes . 
  to corporate bean counters worshiping at the shrine of shareholder profits ? 
  of course not . 
  [ supposedly , they updated it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s4zgt.jpg ) . 
  of course , no canada , no australia , no new zealand . 
  i wonder why they even use the flags anymore , honestly . 
  christianity : just like your old gods , except wine and crackers every sunday !, 
  poland , probably . 
  do n't worry , the actual quote -- `` those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety '' -- [ is taken out of context , anyways ] ( http://www.npr.org/2015/03/02/390245038/ben-franklins-famous-liberty-safety-quote-lost-its-context-in-21st-century ) :  [ franklin ] was writing about a tax dispute between the pennsylvania general assembly and the family of the penns , the proprietary family of the pennsylvania colony who ruled it from afar . 
  and the legislature was trying to tax the penn family lands to pay for frontier defense during the french and indian war . 
  and the penn family kept instructing the governor to veto . 
  franklin felt that this was a great affront to the ability of the legislature to govern . 
  and so he actually meant purchase a little temporary safety very literally . 
  the penn family was trying to give a lump sum of money in exchange for the general assembly 's acknowledging that it did not have the authority to tax it . 
  the `` essential liberty '' that franklin talks about is the freedom to defend the colony from attack in the french and indian war ( i.e. , the seven years ' war ) and the `` temporary safety '' was , presumably , temporary * financial * safety of the penn family or temporary safety of the position of the governor . 
  idea being that if the governor did n't do something about the invasion because he was afraid the penns would remove him , the french and their allies would certainly see to his removal when they conquered the colony . 
  that does n't mean the usage that it 's used for today is n't valid , of course . 
  still , i prefer edward snowden 's quote discussing erosion of rights :  arguing that you do n't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you do n't care about free speech because you have nothing to say . 
  and [ the context in which he wrote those words ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/36ru89/just_days_left_to_kill_mass_surveillance_under/crglgh2 ) is very much on topic . 
  so , who gets to rename westminster abby ? 
  well , probably not salvador dali . 
  given the amount of conflict in the area , it may be 50 % in a few years . 
  no , classical liberalism says that the quality labor ( the smart and the skilled ) will choose to work in industries that provide the best compensation .
