  are you almostmadeithappen , butsadlydid n't - phobic because you filled your glass with coke too fast and it spilled , but almost did n't ? 
  made up retarded words do n't help anyone . 
  if anything , remote control will be used for terrorism not for stopping it . 
  i also doubt that current battery technology is anywhere near feasible for moving the weights lorrys do . 
   the passport laws palani is accused of breaching are part of a number of measures taken by denmark to attempt to stem the flow of fighters to the middle east . 
  the country is second only to belgium in the number of jihadi fighters per head of population in europe . 
  the law aims to prevent individuals travelling when a journey may involve issues such as national security or `` a substantial threat to public order '' . 
  i have no words to describe how baffled i am . 
  i hope they 'll take away the police 's guns in new gun laws aimed to stem terrorism , instead of admitting who the perpetrators are and focusing on them , when it 's them getting gunned down . 
  maybe then they 'll realize actions have consequences out here in the real world . 
  women broke a glass ceiling in 2016 , just not the one they were planning on , i guess . 
   never talks back . 
  who 's fault is that ? 
   us-backed terrorist meh , they 're not wrong on that , half-truths like that are often basis for a frustrated ` fuck you ' to the western mainstream ~ ~ propaganda ~ ~ media . 
  convenient , is n't it ? 
  you , as the foundation is the one who gets to decide what counts towards `` program expense '' , and what is n't , given that 's all you have to put on the publicly available tax reports , meaning you are the only entity who gets to decide what is and what is n't allowed to be counted as `` charity activity '' , even tho direct aid make up a tiny fraction of your spending . 
  even more convenient how you refuse to accept the td link , where they copy verbatim what the clinton people said ( to each other ) . 
  maybe taking a look there , reading the mail where they talk about how they need to shush the guy whom they 're rending a gigantic office space to be left empty . 
  if they write that as `` program expense '' , that gigantic empty office space is a charitable spending as well in the eyes of the watchdog . 
  i do n't take anything i read at td as true , i look up the source , where the verbatim quoute is from . 
  if it 's not there , i ignore it . 
  i do n't take any partisan piece as gospel . 
  they file their travel costs as `` program expenses '' , that 's where the money is , yet `` your source '' goes along with it , and does n't call it out being travel expenses , which it is . 
  do n't ruin your brain either . 
  http://www.dailywire.com/news/8561/7-things-you-need-know-about-clinton-foundation-aaron-bandler funnily enough this includes your cn , which at first refused to rate them , because of their ` atypical ' business model ( yep , i agree tho , a charity that spends a tiny fraction of it 's money on actual charity is very atypical ) . 
  i 'm not going to imply anything here , but somehow they 've quickly changed their mind after they 've publicly put the clinton foundation on a list composed of organizations with less-than-stellar reputation . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5bbira/a_simple_guide_to_the_clinton_foundation/ which mostly goes into the leaks , given how the leaks are `` wrongthink '' , i only found the td , which you might not accept . 
  the clinton foundation/machine is the same grade of corruption as trump keeping his business , the only difference is the clinton foundation is actually functioning and is actually worldwide , while i 'm personally not convinced trump 's company is . 
  i 'm honestly puzzled how people seem to be so incredibly scared about `` the sacred democracy being ruined by evil russzian hakkers '' , while the dnc leaks draw up how clinton literally bought her nomination , if that 's not the exact opposite of democracy , then i might just be out of touch with the meaning of the word . 
  also just to clarify : i think both us prez candidates are pure cancer , the only reason i 'd take trump is to see clinton 's machine crash and burn with the billions they 've `` invested '' into buying the presidency . 
  so what people are * allowed * to consider when voting ? 
  since exposed corruption is n't one of that . 
  so what stops corruption ? 
  keeping the same people in , hoping their royal bloodline will luckily breed corruption out of itself ? 
   cdu/csu is conservative , but not pro-russian still peddling to give 20b euro infrastructure to russia , but if that 's the german definition of ` not pro-russian ' , i guess the eu will just have to get in line . 
  sounds oddly convenient for the corrupt government officials . 
  or they push the agenda they need to in order to get paid/keep their jobs , altho suggesting this , i guess , is a ludicrous conspiracy , much like how obfuscating polls and calling elections against the data to suppress voter turnout has to be , even after it 's happened again . 
  that 's not what the eu overlords seem to think when it comes to literally any other country , i guess some people really are more equal than others . 
  i 'm sure someone like the dalai lama is very concerned about the latest leftist corporate media 's * madeup-name scapegoat * , unlike most `` moral authority progressives '' , he does have to deal with actual issues in his daily life . 
  your parents and grandparent 's generation want kadar-era , because they have no idea that 's where most of the debt crippling the country came , and they were n't the ones getting murdered and kidnapped by the regime . 
  the russians have the same work camps the nazis did , without the gas chambers , people from towns/villages next to these camps did n't even knew they existed , only realized it in the '90s when the news started to appear . 
  people want the `` give me work and liveable wage '' kadar-era , which never actually happened . 
  people lived like shit , but since there was no one else to compare it , they accepted it ... that and the fact if they 'd speak up to anyone about it , they 'd find themselves in a work camp for 2 years . 
  people keep talking about how corruption is ruining ee , - which i agree with - , yet they 're yearning for an era where corruption led by incompetent ` useful ' idiots was literally the only way any of the government functioned . 
   pro-putin [ ... ] as is a huge portion of the population . 
  could you please provide some source on that , since i doubt hungarian people are so keen on having the relive the worst dictatorship of their existence . 
  hungary voted for it , i guess it 's time for a random eu paper-pusher to get interviewed about how orban is `` dangerously pro-putin '' , just to keep the narrative going . 
  spoiler alert : he wo n't ever go there . 
  you forgot russian hacker , altho i guess that 's more of an usa thing . 
   true method of defeating terrorism is recognising it 's causes yet you claim i 'm just here to `` justify terrorism '' . 
  palestine is fighting because it was turned into an open-air prison `` state '' . 
  eu did n't done that , not taking sides , just pointing out this inconvenient fact you 've glanced over . 
  seems like horseshit . 
  funnily enough spreading `` fear '' like this is actually populism , but hey , what do i know , i 'm prolly authoritarian evil monster . 
  i have not seen a word about le pen/nf voters in there ? 
  so did the clintons , does that mean they 're pro-putin too ? 
   many people voting le pen are pro putin i 'm sure that 's accurate . 
  not sure what graph , i 've looked up the numbers and it ' clearly not half , i should 've checked beforehand instead of saying a random number . 
  she got half the votes obama did , against a guy that by leftist metric is literally satan . 
  most of the foundation money is spent on `` expenses '' , that are overlapping with both the campaign and the `` clinton machine '' . 
  they are not idiots , they wo n't wire the money to the warchest , because that 's illegal . 
  instead they pay travel/staff/hosting expenses from the foundation , that they wo n't have to spend from the warchest/superpacs ( which they claimed have no direct contact with - which is illegal - , proved false by wl ) . 
  hillary is literally a lawyer , she and her very sizeable team wo n't break the law when it comes to money , they have no reason to , there 's more than enough legroom to operate . 
  pay one thing from the left pocket , pay the other from the right . 
  they control the money , it 's just different names on the papers to make it legal . 
  she lost millions of votes , just look at previous elections . 
  be sure to stick to the progressive mainstream media , so you can be `` honest with yourself '' , without reevaluating anything based on reality . 
  will juncker dare go against the reddit experts on the matter , tho ? 
  i think that 's the question we should be asking . 
   do n't make up stuff then maybe you should talk about the point i 've raised instead of the one you pretended it was . 
  `` europe '' did n't care about the european interests being harmed , when it was eastern-europe , now it suddenly cares when it 's their own . 
  `` europe '' did n't care about what eu/european interests were harmed when the russia sanctions hit eastern-europe , instead called everyone who did n't want their agro export to take a hit a pro-putin anti-european far-rightwing puppet . 
  ` european values ' for thee ... 
  marxism refers to the group equity , and the cultural part refers to the groups/labels that define individuals . 
  there 's no outside oversight . 
  even when they caught they can leverage the cases to be handled internally . 
   it seems to be `` anyone i do n't agree with '' that 's probably every negative label nowadays , which is unfortunate , when actual fuckwits need to be described people just shrug the labels off , because it has been bastardized so much . 
  they are more productive than others statistically , which means they are more qualified for the job , that 's the opposite of discrimination . 
  as for the rest , try opening a history book first . 
  the media can lie all they want , it 's not anti-semitic to criticize a convicted insider trader for funding political ngos that undermine foreign societys around the world . 
  the article is lying : `` orban accused the `` billionaire speculator '' of wanting to ** `` settle a million migrants '' in the european union ** , something soros called ** `` disinformation '' ** . '', 
   firstly , he believes that the eu should make a commitment to ** admit at least 300,000 refugees each year ** from front-line countries . 
  from http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/20/soros-lays-out-his-plan-for-europe-to-avoid-george-migrants.html or does anyone believe that the illegal migration will magically stop in 2018 , so europe does n't reach the 1m number soros is accused of ? 
  ( that the eu already exceeded in 2015 , but i do n't dare say it , since it might get me accused of anti-semitism ) i do n't know why articles with multiple objectively false statements are allowed here . 
  you 've said after the war , which neither of your examples were . 
   starvation in capitalist countries since the war is much much more  the irish famine ( s ) and the bengal famine ? 
   how many famines occurred in various european colonies ? 
  imperialism is separate from economic systems , just as the capitalist west had bloody colonies , so did russia in east europe . 
  i think we can all agree that imperialism is immoral . 
   ok so when it happens today its not the economic system 's fault ( capitalism ) but when it happened then it was socialism 's fault ? 
  100m communist bodycount is n't a worldwide data , it 's the bodycount of communist regimes in their own country . 
  the deaths due to famine and epidemics that you are referring to are happening in the 3rd world , in countrys separate from the 100m bodycount countrys . 
  however capitalism did make a giant contribution to the development of the 3rd world . 
  https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/ feel free to look at what capitalism does to child mortality for example . 
   the tragedies in the ussr occurred for pretty much the same reasons you cited ( corruption , incompetence and extreme ideologicism ) . 
  the tragedies occurred , because communism as an economic system is not viable , let alone prosperous . 
  that coupled with genocidal dictators is what caused them . 
   however you seem to implied mass foreign ownership of land and resources is n't a problem . 
  i do n't think i 've implied that , but even if i did , the `` foreign '' countrys whose corrupt politicians sold their natural resources for pennies on the millions for a personal kickback and `` kingdom '' are the ones who are responsible for this , not the system , where this very conduct is considered illegal . 
   thomas sankara yes he did , then - surprise , surprise - went on to become an authoritarian dictator , when people started opposing him .
