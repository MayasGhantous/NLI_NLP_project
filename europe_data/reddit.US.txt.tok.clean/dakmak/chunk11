   being assassinated by western powers as far as i am aware he was murdered when his coup-bro and his associates staged yet another military coup , after which the main coup-bro went on to convict and execute his 2 associates . 
  western powers aside , the `` leadership '' of this country seem murder - and backstab-happy enough on their own . 
  hey guys , nothing to see here , he is just being attacked for being jewish , that 's all these neo-nazi , actual nazi , antisemitic , xenophobic , transphobic , illiberal , backwards , islamophobic , ableist eastern european uncivilized white supremacist have been pushing for more than half a century ... oh shit , it 's actually israel , start screaming about palestine instead !, 
   more people have died from famine and malnutrition since the start of the century under capitalism people die in 3rd world countrys , because their government is corrupt , incompetent , genocidal and the social structures are unstable , not because old macdonald was allowed to own a farm on the other side of the world . 
   thats not even counting children dying from preventable disease . 
  strange you would bring that up , given how lacking the communist systems were in innovation , especially in those fields ( apart from chemistry and physics all they did was make better weaponry , that sure helps prevent diseases ) . 
  to me it looks like the world is using capitalist vaccines with capitalist aid to help 3rd world populations , while communism struggles to feed it 's own people in the first place , despite having the same technological and intellectual starting point as the rest of the 1st world . 
  if it was up to the communist dreamland to help the 3rd world , all they 'd do is starve together . 
  they clearly do n't know what they rioting for , either . 
  that or the 100m dead bodies is part of the pitch . 
  france is different tho , using the state of emergency to arrest and monitor a bunch of climate activists ahead of the climate accords ( the actual activists , not the rioting/looting `` activists / '' `` protesters '' '' ) . 
  because somehow that ties in with the state of emergency that was enacted to fight terrorism . 
  2016 data : sweden : ~ 30 % rejected ~ 49 % subsidiary protection ( person granted subsidiary protection status means [ ... ] who does not qualify as a refugee but [ ... ] ) ** ~ 19 % refugee status ** germany : ~ 31 % rejected ~ 25 % subsidiary protection ( person granted subsidiary protection status means [ ... ] who does not qualify as a refugee but [ ... ] ) ** ~ 40 % refugee status ** from : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d7/distribution_of_first_instance_decisions_on_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applications%2c_2016_%28%25%29_yb17.png, 
  ye , well , neither do they , since the means of production and governance tend to land in the hand of a dictator , whenever `` the people '' '' '' '' '' '' '' `` seize it '' '' '' '' '' '' '' . 
  one upon a time , 100 million dead people later : we just need a better dictator ( like me ) , and it 's finally going to be real communism . 
  it 's because she 's jewish . 
  or is that a soros only cop-out ? 
   ah yes , the gorillions coming in the future for the past 7 years the migration is on the rise , for the past 2-3 years is already being referred to as a crisis . 
  without getting into the whole shit-flinging contest : why do you think this number will suddenly drop to 0 or at least pre-2010 levels in order to avoid enormous demographic change ? 
  what will suddenly change , since the ideological direction of the eu leadership wo n't ? 
  they publish what is sent to them , they ca n't just access government documents from around the world , regardless how hard r/politics cries about it . 
  projected demographic change is n't exactly a surprise to anyone , who 's ideological views still allow them to accepts the reality of facts . 
  it was the same argument for obama having unconstitutional powers which is fine , because he is the good guy and the us is a strong democracy . 
   itself debunking the pull factor and safety myth . 
  how come ? 
  what i bolded is the admission that the smugglers are doing exactly what the ` pull factor ' theory says ? 
  i 'm not saying the rest does n't matter , but they do start with admitting it . 
  the nature of the smuggling changed , in accordance with the theory they are supposedly disputing . 
  i 'm not an expert so take this with a train of salt . 
   '' [ ... ] ( sar ) activities as a potential ` pull factor ' for irregular migration . 
  several [ ... ] have claimed that the presence of rescue boats close to the libyan coast serves as a ` magnet ' or even a ` bridge to europe ' , ** tempting smugglers to send larger numbers of migrants in increasingly unseaworthy vessels ** , thereby increasing the overall death toll . '', 
  then from the report they are citing to show , why they do n't exclude the 1200 deaths from the 2 april '15 catastrophes :  `` while it could appear that only ** the ruthless smugglers who overcrowded unseaworthy boats to the point of collapse are to blame ** , the report focuses on the deeper responsibilities of eu agencies and policy makers . '', 
  if they excluded the 1200 deaths that go against their narrative , this is what their figure 3 would look like : http://i.imgur.com/fuhvkrm.png that report also fails to give sufficient reason why the ( skewed data 's ) correlation proves their suspected causation . 
   `` because migration is seasonal ( there are more arrivals in summer than in winter , ** other things being equal ** ) , we only look at arrivals in the equivalent months '' `` other things '' , however are not equal . 
  http://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/mediterranean/location/5205 unhcr 's monthly breakdown of sea arrivals to italy show that the numbers are fluctuating far too much to simply consider every other factor , * except one * , equal . 
  they really are baiting people into drowning , i 'm glad someone is trying to get it legally recognized . 
  all momentum did was obstruct everything while proposing zero solutions . 
  hungary already has a party like that lmp , `` greens '' , i guess . 
  they started out the same , revolutionary lefties who are against corruption and for reforms . 
  jumped the 5 % parliamentary threshold and stayed there ever since . 
  the only thing momentum did other than obstructionism is the dear leader interviewed here illegally entered a news organization and took pictures and video of a journalist there without his consent , to `` call out his propaganda machine '' . 
  the journo in question made a piece on how momentum is facing allegations of pocketing millions , i guess they forgot to mention that in this interview ... 
  anyhow , no opposition party will get majority until the mszp establishment and the renamed/further fractioned surrogate partys concede to a fresh batch of politicians who are n't branded corrupt and useless . 
  no opposition party can sway away the loyalty votes from them , this has been shown time and time again . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  it was orban 's fidesz that extended the holocause denial laws to `` punish those , who deny the genocides committed by national socialist or communist systems , or deny other facts of deeds against humanity '' . 
  there is nothing liberal about holocaust denial , and it is n't accepted in hungary , either . 
  but i guess , i should n't let facts get in the law of the circlejerk , since clearly hyper-liberal cultural relativism is a far bigger crime in hungary than genocide denial . 
  labour talking about the failure of the `` war on terror abroad '' is very rich . 
  where was that labour party when blair gave the go-ahead for an unjustified invasion , just because bush stroke his ego and made him feel important as an international leader ? 
  also i did n't saw where he echoed your statements in the link . 
  all i saw was him blaming foreign policy for the continued domestic terrorist threat , and many others - including labour 's former home secretary - saying he is wrong , and disingenuous for turning a domestic tragedy into a political platform . 
  if people dismiss everything critical of migration as `` anti-immigration scapegoating '' , then they wo n't see that there are numerous very real problems that are n't solving themselves , and will worse until it ca n't be ignored anymore , problem is , solving them then will be much more difficult . 
  not letting facts get in the way of ideologys has the same effect . 
  claims that #panamapapers themselves are a ` plot ' against russia are nonsense . 
  however hoarding , dc organization & usaid money tilt coverage -- wikileaks ( @wikileaks ) april 6 , 2016, 
  you gave zero sourced proof to support your claim . 
  the article you 've linked only mentioned the sourced quote i gave . 
  you can pretend all you like , i genuinely do n't care , but when you opened with `` do n't lie on the internet , because it 's easy to prove it wrong '' , i expected a tad bit more than your current absolutely not proof . 
  you did n't prove me wrong . 
  the only actual quote that was linked in this conversation was by me , the wl twitter which said the exact opposite of what you are saying . 
  feel free to link a reputable source , or a direct quote with source to prove your point , because thus far you have n't done that . 
   even a story on rt comes up first in the list of a google search . 
  run along . 
  is rt a reliable source now , all of a sudden ? 
   assange accused the leakers of being a cia plot to hurt putin . 
  claims that #panamapapers themselves are a ` plot ' against russia are nonsense . 
  however hoarding , dc organization & usaid money tilt coverage -- wikileaks ( @wikileaks ) april 6 , 2016  tip for arguing : do not blatantly lie on the internet , it 's so easy to prove you wrong . 
  they focus on the west , because unlike with russia , not everyone understands how corrupt and criminal they are . 
  the way the pp were leaked goes against wl 's conduct on transparency , which is to release everything you can , and let the people decide what 's important . 
  unlike in the pp where nobody is allowed to know the full extent of the corruption and criminal acts . 
  wl said that , because that 's what the corporate media did in the west . 
  target unreachable , but known enemies of the people instead of reporting on the domestic perpetrators that we actually have the authority to persecute . 
  i do still think the outrage is justified , given how the icij chose to censor most of the documents . 
  i still think that corporate funded `` ngo '' censoring damning intel on the rich is objectionable . 
   wikileaks strangely tried to paint the panama papers as fake and a cia plot to harm putin . 
  why are you lying ? 
  wl criticized the icij for not releasing all the damning documents . 
  taxcapone pretending his cancerous out-of-touch spineless threats are n't what pushed uk over the fence with brexit , by continuing with his cancerous out-of-touch spineless gestures . 
  * very presidential *,

  breaking a country 's governing system with nothing to replace it is a gigantic mistake , and hurts the people you want to help . 
  if the half a ~ ~ decade ~ ~ * century middle east debacles did n't showed this to us , i do n't know what will , if ever . 
  they provoked russia without having the protection of nato 's article 5 . 
  if the west was honest , they would n't have egged this on , especially if they knew , that they will simply refuse to help and walk away with their strongly worded letters . 
  was poland a defacto vassal of germany ? 
  i guess googleing is just too hard , even if you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  do you think the two situations are comparable ? 
   however ukraine is occupied because it acted out its sovereignty to become closer to western europe . 
  is it closer , then ? 
  that 's my point . 
  i 'm not from the usa , i just use the flair to flush out prejudice . 
  here 's my point : ukraine is economically dependent on russia . 
  all the west offered was `` moral support '' . 
  where is the west when ukrainians are dying ? 
  where is the west when crimea and eastern ukraine is stolen ? 
  fukcing nowhere !, 
  ukranians were egged on to grasp `` the freedom '' , yet all they have is ruin . 
  this is exactly what 's wrong with the middle east . 
  the west jumps in to `` bring freedom and democracy '' , and when the actual work begins they are nowhere to be found .
