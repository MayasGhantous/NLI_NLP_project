  so , i 'll ask again : is ukraine better off now , that they 've `` chose democracy '' ? 
  they made the choice to go against russia , without being in nato . 
  is ukraine better off now tho ? 
  the country went to war with russia and has 0 support . 
  all these groups and nations and `` the eu '' egging on the ukrainians , like democracy was at the tip if their fingers and all they had to do is grasp it . 
  do n't get me wrong , i resent russian occupation , but i do n't see how the current situation is an improvement over it . 
   they get to stay . 
   i do n't doubt that . 
   so it 's the same shit . 
  i do n't think that 's how the law works , or says . 
   and you 're attempting to use one papers prediction to say that all polling is bad ? 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  i 'm not saying that . 
  i did n't follow polling to say it was bad . 
  what i have a problem with is how the outcome was ~ 90 % + clinton , when in fact - as you 've also pointed out - the race was in the margin of error . 
  to me that reads like it should 've been in the 50-60 % range . 
   is he willing to pay up ? 
  for what ? 
  the turkey deal is financed by the eu . 
  the migrant housing in mena countrys are fincanced by the unhcr . 
  what should orban pay for ? 
   most likely no , so in the end , this is just talk . 
  he is willing to negotiate with third countries , if germany is willing to pay up for a deal , that 's great !, 
  what deal did german pay out of it 's pockets for thus far ? 
   should be returned to the safe countries of origin or transit . 
  why wrestle with erdogan if the eu has the size and leverage to strike a deal with their politically weak home countrys ? 
   so the majority of migrants coming to germany and sweden the country that welcomed the most were actual refugees and were given asylum sweden : ~ 30 % rejected ~ 49 % subsidiary protection ( from the link you posted : person granted subsidiary protection status means [ ... ] who does not qualify as a refugee but [ ... ] ) ** ~ 19 % refugee status ** germany : ~ 31 % rejected ~ 25 % subsidiary protection ( from the link you posted : person granted subsidiary protection status means [ ... ] who does not qualify as a refugee but [ ... ] ) ** ~ 40 % refugee status **  do you read what you write ? 
   and you do know that the vote was within the margin of error right ? 
  if something is within the margin of error i do n't put it at 90 % + probability . 
   the majority of people that came to europe were asylum seakers . 
  if they get asylum , they need to be repartitioned in europe . 
  i 'm done with this convo . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:distribution_of_first_instance_decisions_on_ ( non-eu ) _ asylum_applications , _ 2016 _ ( % 25 ) _ yb17.png http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:distribution_of_final_decisions_on_ ( non-eu ) _ asylum_applications , _ 2016 _ ( % 25 ) _ yb17_ii . png  yeah , turkey will say no . 
  what then ? 
  turkey is not their home country . 
   orban lives in his little world where 1 million asylum seakers are not in europe . 
  they 're already in the eu . 
  he has been campaigning to close the balkan route since 2015 . 
  everyone said it 's useless/stupid . 
  since it happened in 2016 , in part because of the fence that everyone condemned , and with the rest of the balkan countrys , that everyone said are moot points , because they are n't schengen/eu , the flow has been stemmed to a trickle there . 
   so we should sort the refugees at the aegean sea ? 
  taking the pressure of greek islands would 've helped a ton . 
  greece is clearly not in a position to fund their border duties . 
  in 2015 the land border with turkey was a problem too . 
   what outside of the eu ? 
  they were already in the eu . 
  and where do you send them ? 
  6return illegal migrants should be returned to the safe countries of origin or transit . 
  this is 2 points down from what you copied . 
  in case you are wondering on `` how ? '', 
  that 's partly the next point ( 7 ) . 
   the way they refuse any cooperation to work on the refugee problem . 
  you should read up on it yourself , instead of repeating what the politicians/media have wrote for you . 
  in 2015 he already called for a join solution , including letting member states help protect greece 's border , unifying safe country regulation across the eu , and sorting migrants at the border . 
  in 2016 he met with eu leaders and member state reps to discuss his 10 point plan that builds on the eu . 
  http://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/here-it-is-hungarys-10-point-action-plan-for-the-management-of-the-migration-crisis/ i 'm not here to campaign for him , but the mainstream media and political status quo is simply lying about him when it comes to migration , which , given how their go-to posturing is moral superiority , seems ironic . 
  copy-pasting this for the `` russian `` links '' allegation '' : [ in 2014 the one nuclear power plant of hungary gave 53,6 % of the electricity ] ( http://hvg.hu/kkv/20150204_csokkent_a_paksi_atomeromu_bevetele_bar_2 ) . 
  the oldest block ( it has 4 ) has an already extended certification to run until 2032 . 
  they either get paks2 or 90 % + of their energy will have to come from russia . 
  i 'm not expert , but getting one nuclear plant built , that runs for 60 years ( citation needed ) is much better than being 90 % + dependent on russian energy . 
  the eu wo n't build south stream , and the last time i 've checked germany is still backing russia 's nord stream 2 ( and the current 1 , as well ) , so for a poor as shit country like hungary there is just no alternative left . 
  it 's either a one-time nuclear plant from russia ( which was - if i recall correctly - considerably cheaper than the competing offers ) , or a half a century pledge for virtual russian control over the energy sector . 
  there is no way they can magically replace their energy production in it 's entirety with renewables , when they ca n't even build a nuclear plant without the contractor footing a big chuck of the bill . 
  i know , that the past few years , the red scare 2 is the go-to political stance when arguing against non-mainstream/establishment politicians , but out here , in the real world politicians have to make actual decisions , and in this case , they chose the much lesser evil . 
  especially if you give a damn about the environment . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5fnzwg6xh4 guess you have n't seen this one in the news . 
   we sure as shit did not , you utter liar . 
  you were/are the eu before eastern european countrys joined . 
  you said yes to it . 
  maybe hold your politicians accountable , instead of being `` revisionist '' about who allowed eastern european countrys to join . 
   most eastern europeans are pro mass immigration , literally millions of them migrated to the west for economic reasons it 's legal , and part of the most important system in the eu : single market . 
  both sides entered the legal union knowing that . 
  it 's not comparable to the illegal , uncontrollable mass migration . 
   anyway , soros isnt actually that pro immigration but nithing wrong with supporting ngo 's that help immigrant . 
  you are just spreading far right propaganda because it fits your xenophobic narrative . 
  thanks for the cancerous bait . 
  maybe you can read his personal beliefs that is supported by his billions to find out what he is working towards instead . 
   also go read a economics book if you dont understand trading . 
  like wtf has insider trading to do with that ? 
  is that what you are going to tell to the xenophobic , antisemitic courts that pronounced him guilty ? 
  glad you know better than them . 
  i guess trading rules are only there to keep hard working , honest people down in a xenophobic , antisemitic , islamophobic , alt-righteous , transphobic , white-supremacist , sexist society . 
  if i forgot to add any mandatory virtue signal , please let me know , and i 'll add it later , in compliance with the * moral superiority complex guidelines * . 
  on eu level the government ( currently orban and co ) are the only ones who can push for a change , there is no way the even lighter weight meps could do anything , especially since the leftist ones are against orban 's every policy , because he is their opposition , so i 'm guessing you are left with orban 's meps or maybe jobbik 's , but siding with jobbik is prolly political suicide . 
  to me it seems like orban 's party is the only thing that can change anything on an eu level , for a hungarian voter . 
  i personally doubt that you can legally exploit them any harder than the current ( ee ) migrant work force already is in some cases . 
  why would german companys hire a mena migrant who needs extra education compared to their eastern european counterparts ? 
   there 's no alternative whatsoever , the message is you either support their vague yet to be proven conspiracy allegations or kneel down before the public enemy soros and the eu . 
  i mean realistically what alternative is there ? 
  which ngo are they talking about ? 
  musk had to take the government bailout to save tesla , but that means he has to create jobs in the us . 
  if he just shipped off production overseas/out of sight he could work with the same production costs the rest of the industry already does . 
  you can vote a party out of power at the worst every 4 years . 
  you ca n't vote entire demographics out of your country , especially 2-3 generations down the line . 
  altho if you refuse to acknowledge the issues , i guess there is n't really a point in discussing it . 
  but hey , `` my socially homogeneous , low unemployment , high income neighborhood is as safe & sound as it every was , so i guess people just need to tone their phobias down '' . 
  ee had to join via national referendums . 
  you ca n't convince people to give up thing without giving something in return . 
  plus , obviously , having a relatively stable economy is an important part of maintaining a functioning market to sell on . 
   also education in ee is often shit so you cant even compare it to western education .
