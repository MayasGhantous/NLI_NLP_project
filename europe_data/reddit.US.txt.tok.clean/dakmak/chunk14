   10/10 for being too afraid to actually address the arguments . 
  thanks for the prejudice and the lies . 
  i 'll address your `` argument '' , sure . 
  sanctuary citys `` fight '' deportation , by refusing to cooperate with federal authorities , who need local cooperation , because they do n't have infinite resources , time and manpower . 
  knowing that and still refusing to cooperate is being on the side of unchecked illegal immigration , because that makes them literally part of the problem . 
  so yes , when people say :  there is no person anywhere in europe who is not critical of unchecked immigration and illegal immigration . 
  then you reply :  seriously . 
  not here and not in the u.s. . 
  if you refuse to acknowledge that aiding illegal immigrants in staying in a country illegally is being for illegal immigration , then there is nothing me - or anyone for that matter - can say that will change your point of view , because you are either speaking from complete ignorance , or an ideological dogma . 
  neither of which is productive in any sort of rational argument . 
  9/10 for form on those mental gymnastics . 
  realistically , what will mena countrys do ? 
  we fund the unhcr camps , that if they lose funding will ravage the mena host countrys first . 
  we give aid to mena countrys , yet have absolutely zero foreign policy influence on them , not even about taking their own people back . 
  eu has the absolute upper hand , but refuses to act , because of ideological and political reasons . 
  ban everyone from applying for asylum ( for 5-10 , or w/e years ) if you arrive on the sea , so we can finally stop baiting tens of thousands into drowning . 
  joint member frontex forces on the outer borders . 
  while your application is being processed you remain in a closed transit zone on the border you 've entered . 
  instead of one politician ransoming the eu out to erdogan , it 's time we invest in each other . 
   seriously . 
  not here and not in the u.s. 
  the us has sanctuary cities that literally mean they fight the federal deportation of illegal migrants . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   normie eu family maybe it 's you who the eu should be deporting wherever . 
   in le pen 's case , by making french society more hostile towards muslims . 
  le pen is only getting votes because of the issues stemming from what you claim is coming * because * of le pen . 
  i 'm saying it 's chronologically the other way around . 
  you are implying le pen and the like are creating the breeding ground for terrorists , when it 's chronologically the other way around . 
  the islamist problem was the first , not le pen and the like getting anywhere near forming a government . 
  people just were n't allowed to talk about it when it was `` only '' parallel societys , low employment migrant ghettos and the decline in public safety/social cohesion , the increased and unsustainable strain on welfare programs and spending . 
  isis is n't orchestrating societal divides , they are the benefactors of it , after the fact that it was allowed to develop . 
  they are bombing , murdering , enslaving and ravaging , because that 's what they are , that 's their model of a society , not to convince * otherwise an engineer muslim man * to mow down evil westerners . 
  as for the post you 've linked comparing the millennia old sectarian divide of the islamic world to civilized western societys trying to put their foot down to preserve societal progress is a dishonest and pointless comparison . 
  or you could read the isis manifesto where they tell you , all they want is destruction , if you are n't one of them . 
  but i guess blaming * everyone else * will help . 
  you ca n't win if you do n't die !, 
  vote canadian in the french election !, 
   isolated attacks how come ? 
  they 're connected in ideological motivation and are n't that far between ( if we are counting the foiled ones as well ) . 
  so they were murdering and violently oppressing everyone left-and-right , except gays ? 
  huh , makes sense , i guess . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/27/paris-climate-activists-put-under-house-arrest-using-emergency-laws it 's obviously not the same scale , but the same principle . 
  they did use it against climate activists , putting them under house arrest and such . 
  but i guess going after ngos is only bad if politicians we do n't like are doing it . 
  i 'm sure one of the ~ 15 copy-pasted * verynotsuspiciouslysmall * subs will give an accurate representation of the 63m people who voted for trump . 
   good quality journalism . 
  can you link the video you 've watched , please ? 
   but was there a reason to fire 59 missiles at $ 80 million total ? 
  ( real question ) to show commitment and strength ? 
  pretty ironic that it took electing trump that people started to question political leaders , just because thus far the ( mainstream ) media were complicit in manufacturing consent , when trump just lies openly on his own , that people are finally able to stop taking things at face value . 
  i 'm glad people are putting price tags on each military action , maybe it will prevent the next iraq , when people have a perspective of the price ( not just financial ) of decisions , instead of getting an `` oh well , we are 5 trillion $ s in so far '' years down the line . 
   oppositely the reaction to the chemicals bombing which afaik was very ineffective ( enlighten me if i am wrong ) . 
  if anything this was the best possible response to such complicated situation , something most people did n't expect possible from the trump administration . 
  they 've hit assad to show intent , strength and determination of upholding geneva convention without jeopardizing his ability to fight isis . 
  they 've hit russia 's ally ( assad ) without giving a change for russia to exploit the justified american response to a nerve gas attack , by alerting russia in advance . 
  how would nato members fight each other ?

'', 
  '' , the link above . 
  i did n't really find a reputable source in english with all the examples , but you can google `` vitpixling '' and see for yourself . 
  a few specific cases are being talked about here and there , but `` whole collection '' i only found on questionable sites , so i wo n't link it . 
  some other stuff i 've source checked : the last time official crime numbers based on ethnicity was published in sweden was 2005 . 
  despite repeated calls , the taxpayer funded statistics were not made available . 
  edit : looks like since last time i 've posted spesia 's article on this , reurope has put it on the undersireable 's list . 
  one of the most controversial topics when it comes to sweden is the rapes/sexual crimes . 
  the governmental script has been like this : ( http://www.government.se/articles/2017/02/facts-about-migration-and-crime-in-sweden/ - scroll down )  the number of reported rapes in sweden has risen . 
  but the definition of rape has broadened over time , which makes it difficult to compare the figures . 
  it is also misleading to compare the figures with other countries , as many acts that are considered rape under swedish law are not considered rape in many other countries . 
  for example : if a woman in sweden reports that she has been raped by her husband every night for a year , that is counted as 365 separate offences ; in most other countries this would be registered as a single offence , or would not be registered as an offence at all . 
  willingness to report such offences also differs dramatically between countries . 
  a culture in which these crimes are talked about openly , and victims are not blamed , will also have more cases reported . 
  sweden has made a conscious effort to encourage women to report any offence . 
  yet , from https://www.bra.se/download/18.35c681d4143337cb6b29e9/1395068367808/2013_1_ntu_2013.pdf ( annual crime survey , it 's called i think ? ), 
  on page 47-48 it says that `` most of the sexual offences are committed in a public place ( 50 % ) , and the perpetrator ( s ) are most often unknown to the victim ( 63 % ) '' so , - to me - it seems like the swedish establishment 's `` script '' on why the number of rapes is increasing is based on blatant misinformation and misrepresenting data . 
  again , - to me - it seems like if they 'd released the repeatedly called for taxpayer funded statistics on perpetrators by ethnicity people could get a factually correct picture on where crime is coming from . 
  because it is coming from somewhere , contrary to other western civilized country 's tendecys swedish crime is on the increase ( https://www.bra.se/bra/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/crime-statistics/reported-offences.html ) so , when experts talk about media freedom , i ca n't help , but feel like government misinformation , lack of access to taxpayer funded statistics ( that are made available in other civilized country 's ) , systematic ( self - ) censorship and misinformation in compliance with government mandated `` ethics '' rules is not something that should put you at number 8 , for the 2016 press freedom index . 
  like legitimizing sharia courts to deal with them behind closed doors ? 
  eh , do these indexes actually reflect reality or just a flawed way of trying to quantify complex issues in a single number based on arbitrary scopes ? 
  i mean the media freedom index ( or w/e the name is ) has sweden up near the top , despite their public broadcasting 's code of conduct saying they should try to hide/misrepresent crime involving non-natives , or the countless times they 've been caught with misinformation ( recoloring pixelation , etc ) . 
   should have made a shift to the left instead . 
  what would that mean in terms of policy ? 
  not op , but the video i saw from them was the gmo one , because it was posted here . 
  i felt like the flashy graphics convinced people about the quality even if they presented the issue in a very one-sided manner , which - to me - seemed problematic , since their undertone was `` let 's clear up misconceptions about this great thing '' . 
  i have no problem with the science end of the things , just to clarify in advance . 
  they 've completely ignored the economic ( real world ) consequences , while pretending they did n't already knew how `` the market will fill in the blanks '' tend to end , especially when gigantic corporations `` hide '' their operation behind 3rd world borders from the prying eyes of regulatory and inspection bodies . 
  giving absolute worldwide monopoly to a handful of corporation when it comes to the foodstock of the entire species , with the only actual safety net being `` i 'm sure/hoping they 'll do it right '' , seems absolutely mad , yet this is what they 've campaigned for , completely ignoring how turning agriculture into a high entry cost industry would completely change the socioeconomic situation for most people on earth , especially the poorer 2/3 , who are already the most vulnerable to change . 
  to me this one , and most of the other videos from the same type of `` science presenters '' seem to fail at giving a realistic approach to things ( especially when politics is involved ) , while masquerading as you can simply explain things `` sciencily '' and that 's all there is to it . 
  i 'm not a computer expert , but does n't that img tag at the end mean they put the yandex company logo out ? 
  so how is that secret ? 
  seems pretty weird to me why they would try to steal data with a client-side code . 
  thanks for the write up , what i 'm interested is actual sources . 
  also corruption does n't make you pro-putin , and the government 's corruption was n't the topic either . 
  any proof of anything ? 
  if only any of these articles mentioned at least one concrete piece of evidence ... is germany going back to it 's eastern roots in russia , because merkel is pushing for nord stream 2 ? 
  - see i can make baseless spins too . 
  pretty ironic how `` the report '' suggests better media literacy education to young people , given that would expose their own fear-mongering . 
  ahhh , the glorious , wonderful socialist paradise of scammie sanders , venezuela . 
  i 've been informed , that it is a worker 's paradise , a just society built on socialist values and norms . 
  any country , including the usa , or in this case france should strive to be like venezuela . 
   as islamists are still muslims , just with a very perverted understanding of their faith . 
  is there really a difference in lexical meaning or is this the kind of `` migrants we like are refugees , migrants we do n't like are migrants '' ?
