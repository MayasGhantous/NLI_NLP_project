it was also popular in the uk too in the early 20th century . 
  it died out there when the nhs decided not to cover non-therapeutic genital surgery given all the infant fatalities it had caused ( [ gairdner , 1949 ] ( http://www.cirp.org/library/general/gairdner/ ) ) . 
  it was popular in canada , australia and new zealand in the past too . 
  canada 's down to around 15-30 % . 
  australia 's down to 10 % , and nz 's down to less than 1 % . 
  you can read more about the history of medicalized genital cutting in [ / r/intactivists/wiki : timeline of medicalized genital surgery ] ( / r/intactivists/wiki / index #wiki _ 19th_century ) . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  til cosmetic tail cropping/docking is illegal in many european countries including sweden , norway , finland , denmark , switzerland , austria , germany , the netherlands , greece , cyprus , luxembourg , the uk . 
  and speaking for vets in the us , the avma issued a statement opposing cosmetic tail docking . 
  https://www.avma.org/kb/resources/faqs/pages/frequently-asked-questions-about-canine-tail-docking.aspx http://kb.rspca.org.au/why-is-the-rspca-opposed-to-the-tail-docking-of-dogs_135.html http://awc.upei.ca//files/awc/tail_docking.pdf, 
  a little analysis shows that 2012 aap statement was incredibly deceptive . 
  the authors of that statement were obviously intentionally trying to take advantage of doctors ' , parents ' , and journalists ' natural inclination to misinterpret the meaning of the phrases and the implied omission of that first sentence of the quote . 
  the conjunction choice `` but '' instead of `` and '' was also explicitly deceptive ensuring misunderstanding the first part of the sentence . 
  this deception cleverly succeeds in using logic against the reader through what appear to be innocent mistakes . 
  making the minimized subtext explicit , the sentence would read : the aap found that the ** [ extremely minor ] ** health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks ** [ of the surgery -- not the `` risk '' of not performing non-therapeutic surgery as most people mistakenly assume they meant ] ** , *** [ and ] *** the benefits are not great enough to recommend universal newborn circumcision . 
  right . 
  the primary benefit of genital cutting is to the culture that is then able to build up weird social and cultural borders based around denigrating the foreskin . 
  to see this , just look at almost any reference to intact foreskin in us popular media . 
  this idea of insulting parts of the body making parents think they should amputate healthy parts from children is fundamentally the same problem as female genital cutting . 
  europeans are in a much better position to appreciate that fact than we are in the us . 
  until relatively recently , people did not realize that genital skin destruction surgery destroyed 30-50 % of the surface area of the penis including what are most often the best feeling parts of the penis ( [ taylor , 1996 ] ( http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/ ) ; [ meislahn & taylor , 2004 ] ( http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-4011-0_3 ) ; [ sorrells , 2007 ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2006.06685.x/abstract ) -- [ nsfw relevant diagram ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/sorrells.gif ) ; [ bronselaer , 2013 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374102 ) ) . 
  [ podnar ( 2012 ) ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21883821 ) found that foreskin destruction routinely depresses the ability to elicit a normal penile reflex response . 
  quoting [ basu ( 2011 ) ] ( http://books.google.com/books?id=8vmo3vpqi0cc&amp;pg=pa81 ) :  circumcision is essentially a surgical excision of the prepuce and it involves removal of many of the fine-touch corpuscular receptors . 
  the exposed glans mucosa after circumcision becomes abnormally keratinized with an increase in the number of cell layers in the mucosal epithelium of the glans . 
  as the urethral meatus is exposed , it becomes prone to irritation . 
  at operation , the frenular artery may need to be tied thus depriving the anterior urethra of its major blood supply . 
  the combined effect of urethral ischemia and irritation may predispose to the development of meatal stenosis in 5-10 % of circumcised males . 
  as most of the penile dartos muscle is removed , only a few bundles of muscle are left at the circumcision scar . 
  it has been observed that the flaccid penis in circumcised males tends to hang less vertically than in those with complete anatomy . 
  loss of dartos muscle support presumably explain this difference . 
  certainly , the loss of most of the penile dartos muscle renders positional adjustments of the penis during erection and with temperature changes , rather difficult . 
  for unknown reasons , keloid formation after circumcision is quite rare . 
   circumcision or amputation of the prepuce at the level of corona of glans removes many of the fine-touch corpuscular receptors from the penis . 
  there are several different theories regarding what happens when the nerves of the sensory receptors of the prepuce are transected during circumcision . 
  some have speculated that after circumcision , these nerves regenerate and develop new encapsulated receptors . 
  accordingly , the proponents of this theory believe than any loss of these receptors is temporary and would not be apparent after 6 months of circumcision . 
  however , this theory is contrary to human and animal studies that in a nerve transaction with amputation of the distal tissue , the proximal nerve undergoes acute axonal swelling . 
  without the distal nerve , attempts at reinnervation results in a bulbous , disordered tangle of axons , schwann cells and fibrous tissue . 
  histology of the male circumcision scar shows amputation neuromas , schwann cell proliferation and the bulbous collection of variably sized neuritis . 
  amputation neuromas do not mediate normal sensation and are notorious for generating pain . 
  it is conjectured that any change in the sexual behavior after circumcision may be related to a central nervous system alteration by retrograde axonal degeneration , or to peripheral nervous system damage from loss of the prepuce-ridged bands and amputation neuroma . 
  is that good ? 
  yeah , this person might be lying . 
  there are a lot of genital surgery promoters on reddit who will say anything to promote the surgery . 
  two nurses i know said that infant genital surgeries are the most brutal things that they 've ever seen as nurses . 
  one said she has needed some time to be alone to cry after the infant genital surgeries she 's had to take part in . 
  on a side note about nurses , in the us , many doctors and nurses at us hospitals are not allowed to tell parents * that the surgery is elective * or explain that the word elective means non-therapeutic . 
  only concerned with the money they make from the surgery , the hospitals want to take advantage of the fact that ignorant new parents often mistakenly assume the surgery is therapeutic . 
  to add to your reference of realistic genital surgeries , there are a few videos of surgeries in [ / r/intactivists/wiki ] ( / r/intactivists/wiki / index #wiki _ circumcision_videos ) that do represent typical surgeries . 
   the foreskin is not a disease or a condition that is exactly the issue at the heart of this debate . 
  those who support genital cutting consider the human penis to be innately deformed . 
  the cultural effects of involuntary non-therapeutic genital cutting are very interesting . 
  the practice divides human cultures into two groups , those who respect children 's bodies and those who think the intact penis needs destructive surgical `` correction . '', 
  of course it should be considered significant that the concept that the intact human genitalia is so flawed it requires destructive surgical correction is exactly the same idea behind female genital cutting . 
  the cultural logic runs deeper . 
  the idea that the foreskin is somehow feminine or vagina-like is present in some anti-foreskin cultures like much of africa and the us . 
  this creates a cultural idea of masculinizing the penis by amputating its feminine part . 
  female genital cutting is very often performed for the obvious corollary bad idea , feminizing the vulva by amputating its masculine part ( s ) . 
  along with the fact that the foreskin is normally a valuable part of the body ( which is more obvious in genitally intact european cultures ) , the other key misunderstanding underpinning this debate ( on finally restricting involuntary non-therapeutic genital modification ) is that the anti-foreskin movement , the force promoting medicalized genital cutting , has never been acknowledged by the mainstream media . 
  by ignoring the idea that their sort of bias exists , they 've been able to misrepresent themselves and their biased findings as unbiased medical researchers and normal/legitimate research . 
  they are propagandists misusing science to deceive to promote genital cutting for cultural or other purposes . 
  europeans are in a much better position to see that this is obviously propaganda rather than legitimate science . 
  many european medical organizations and authorities have acknowledged the cultural bias in , for instance , the aap 's recommendation of parental choice in non-therapeutic / `` elective '' genital cutting of children . 
  do n't let these people deceive the world into cutting their children 's genitals . 
  they convinced the us to cut children 's genitals when people had not developed any ethical ideas about respecting the child 's right to autonomy over his ( or her ) own body using unbelievably terrible science . 
  unbelievably terrible science was all it took to convince people 100 years ago . 
  now they have much better ( looking ) research , and they 're trying to expand genital cutting practices into asia and south america and maintain legal protection of genital cutting in europe despite the majority of european doctors opposing `` elective '' destructive genital modification ( especially northern european doctors ) . 
  \\* please do n't let them succeed in deceiving the rest of the world . 
  please stand against involuntary non-therapeutic genital cutting , citizens of europe ( and especially denmark at the moment ) . 
   [ circumcision ] 's a cultural thing inherited from a religious tradition that only made sense because anything related to sex in the past was taboo , including cleaning their own privates . 
  that is correct . 
  here 's evidence from [ / r/intactivists/wiki : timeline ] ( / r/intactivists/wiki / index #wiki _ medicalized_foreskin_destruction ) :  [ circumcision ] does not necessitate handling of the penis by the child himself and therefore does not focus the male 's attention on his own genitals . 
  masturbation is considered less likely . 
  alan f. guttmacher , should the baby be circumcised ? , * parents magazine * , vol . 
   the prepuce is one of the great factors in causing masturbation in boys . 
  here is the dilemma we are in : if we do not teach the growing boy to pull the prepuce back and cleanse the glans there is the danger of smegma collecting and of adhesions and ulcerations forming , which in their turn will cause irritation likely to lead to masturbation . 
  if we do teach the boy to pull the prepuce back and cleanse his glans , that handling alone is sufficient gradually and almost without the boy 's knowledge to initiate him into the habit of masturbation ... 
  therefore , off with the prepuce !, 
  william j. robinson , circumcision and masturbation , medical world , vol . 
  speaking of smegma , men think circumcision makes them incapable of accumulating anything like that , but that 's not true unless the surgery was done so `` tightly '' ( destructively ) that it 's what the pro-surgery crew on reddit considers `` botched '' by virtue of excess tissue destruction . 
  [ [ / r/intactivists/wiki : explanation of differences between foreskin destruction surgeries ] ( / r/intactivists/wiki / index #wiki _ categorizing_variations_of_foreskin_destruction ) ] the recent claim that normal-tight cuts can be considered botched is just the pro-surgery/anti-foreskin movement 's attempt at damage control . 
  it is not what they really believe ( at least not the sadist-pervert ringleaders of `` medical '' anti-foreskin activism like [ vernon quaintance ] ( http://www.circleaks.org/index.php?title=vernon_quaintance ) , [ jake waskett ] ( http://www.circleaks.org/index.php?title=jake_h._waskett ) , and [ brian morris ] ( http://www.circleaks.org/index.php?title=brian_j._morris ) ) . 
  then , if you look at the medical literature ( authored by anti-foreskin activists ) , you 'll see that the pro-surgery/anti-foreskin movement has never considered excessive destruction of the skin of the penis to be a drawback . 
  in fact , on their websites and in their comments they leave all over the internet , you can see that the anti-foreskin movement has always promoted the maximum destruction of tissue as ideal . 
  this movement is ridiculously deceptive . 
  they approach the promotion of involuntary non-therapeutic foreskin destruction surgery like they 're engaging in wartime psychological warfare necessary to save their homeland . 
  in a sense , they are . 
  the cultural blemish that is the anti-foreskin/involuntary non-therapeutic foreskin destruction movement is an inevitable part of the fundamental cultural problem of allowing involuntary non-therapeutic cultural mutilations to be performed on children ( for whatever reason some surgery-loving perverts on the internet can imagine ) . 
  non-therapeutic surgery could be assumed because * infant * foreskin destruction surgery is essentially never therapeutic . 
  according to the royal college of surgeons of england , there 's almost never any medical indication for foreskin destruction surgery until after the age of 5 ( [ ref ] ( http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/publications/docs/male_circumcision.html ) ) . 
   the foreskin is not a disease or a condition . 
  in the us and islam and other genital cutting cultures , the foreskin is culturally perceived as a deformity . 
  some men seem to consider it vagina like . 
  the anti-foreskin movement is very active on reddit . 
  you can see them saying things to this effect pretty regularly . 
  along with pathologizing the foreskin , conflating * therapeutic * surgical destruction of defective foreskin and * non-therapeutic * / cultural destruction of healthy foreskin is one of the main ways the anti-foreskin movement has promoted foreskin destruction in the us . 
  obviously this lube idea must be a joke . 
  the forces originally behind the anti-foreskin/anti-masturbation movement in british and us medicine were originally religious , but it has since become its own movement ( though still obviously reinforced by religious interests and individuals ) . 
  money has been a significant part of the anti-foreskin movement too . 
  in the right circumstances , a doctor can make a huge amount of money doing infant genital surgeries .
