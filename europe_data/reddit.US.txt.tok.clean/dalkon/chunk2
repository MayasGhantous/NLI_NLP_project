  even in places with relatively low rates of genital cutting like canada ( 15-30 % ) , a doctor can net more than a million dollars a year doing nothing but infant genital surgeries . 
  tbf europeans are n't the only ones who can see non-therapeutic/cultural genital cutting is abuse of parental rights . 
  [ a 2012 online survey of australian doctors ] ( http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/strong-opposition-to-newborn-circumcision ) found 74 % believed newborn circumcision should not be offered and 51 % considered it tantamount to child abuse saying it should never be performed . 
  why would n't any doctor anywhere be allowed to do that ? 
  infant genital surgery is a non-therapeutic/cosmetic/cultural surgery . 
  there 's a difference between opting out of performing cosmetic surgery on infant 's genitals and denying therapeutic medicine . 
  foreskin amputation is a body modification that destroys a part of the body . 
  do you consider the foreskin to be something other than a part of the body ? 
  \\* tbf i never said i thought it destroys a child 's genitals * entirely * , i only said it destroys a part of the body . 
  while it is not large , the foreskin is a very significant part of the human penis . 
  it 's normally the most sensitive part of the penis ( [ sorrells , 2007 ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2006.06685.x/abstract ) -- [ nsfw relevant diagram ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/sorrells.gif ) ) , and the majority of men with intact foreskin agree that it 's the best feeling part of the penis ( [ meislahn & taylor , 2004 ] ( http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-4011-0_3 ) ) . 
  from a religious perspective , should n't we all agree that the religious significance of doing something ( like destructive genital surgery ) voluntarily must be greater than the religious significance of forcing a body modification on a child ? 
  what does the community actually get out of infant genital surgery ? 
  what other parts of children 's bodies do you think communities should be permitted to have the right to destroy ? 
  source ? 
  many studies have found a higher prevalence of premature ejaculation among men with circumcised foreskin . 
  [ o'hara & o'hara ( 1999 ) ] ( http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/ohara/ ) reported more premature ejaculation in circumcised men . 
  ( 2005 ) ] ( http://www.cirp.org/library/sex_function/masood1/ ) reported that circumcision is more likely to worsen premature ejaculation than improve it . 
  [ richters ( 2006 ) ] ( http://www.cirp.org/library/general/richters1/ ) found that the rate of `` reaching orgasm too quickly for at least one month in the previous year '' was 20 % higher for circumcised men ( 26 % of circumcised men ) . 
  [ tang & khoo ( 2011 ) ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21492404 ) found circumcision , not intact foreskin , was correlated with premature ejaculation . 
  [ bollinger & van howe ( 2011 ) ] ( http://www.biomedsearch.com/article/alexithymia-circumcision-trauma-preliminary-investigation/271664388.html ) found that , `` circumcised men are 2.56 times more likely to suffer from premature ejaculation , and , when the data were adjusted to include erectile dysfunction , that risk rose to 4.88 times '' . 
  a recent multinational population survey using stopwatch assessment of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time ( ielt ) found that turkish men , the vast majority of whom are circumcised , had the shortest ielt ( [ waldinger et al. , 2005 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16422843 ) ) . 
  [ kim & pang ( 2006 ) ] ( http://www.cirp.org/library/sex_function/kim2006/ ) reported decreased ejaculation latency time in men circumcised as adults , though the decrease was below statistical significance . 
  [ frisch ( 2011 ) ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21672947 ) , a survey of men and their female partners in denmark , found that the female partners of men with circumcised penises were twice as likely to say that their sexual needs were n't fulfilled and three times more likely to have frequent orgasm difficulties . 
  as a possible explanation of how circumcision increases the incidence of premature ejaculation , [ zwang ( 1997 ) ] ( http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/zwang.html ) theorized that the removal of the foreskin and prevention of all indirect stimulation of the corona may cause premature ejaculation in some men . 
  whether this is why or it is something more complicated , there 's significant evidence that intact foreskin does not cause premature ejaculation , normally it helps to prevent it despite making the penis more sensitive . 
  there * is * also a higher incidence of delayed ejaculation ( also mentioned in frisch , 2011 ) , which you appear to be referencing as a good thing , but it 's worth pointing out that circumcision increases the incidence of both orgasm timing problems . 
  that 's called mezizah and i 'm pretty sure that it 's legal everywhere . 
  what country did you think had a law against it ? 
  \\* the only people who still do it with direct oral contact ( as was adopted in the 5th century ) are the minority fundamentalist wing of judaism , the haredi . 
  most jewish circumcision uses a glass tube to prevent direct oral-genital contact ( and a significantly higher risk of wound infection ) . 
  the nyc health department has * spoken * against the practice ( yet has taken no action ) . 
  there are rumors israeli politicians may be considering banning it there . 
  the reason direct oral-genital contact in destructive infant genital ritual surgery has not yet been banned anywhere on earth is because not many people do it since rabbis finally accepted the glass tube with the 19th century medicalization of ritual genital surgery . 
  you can read more about this history in [ / r/intactivists/wiki ] ( / r/intactivists/wiki / index #wiki _ religious_foreskin_amputation ) if you 're interested . 
  the application of a slight vacuum itself does n't seem like a terrible idea , i could see how it could modify how the scar develops positively , but non-therapeutic infant genital surgery itself is not ethical . 
  destructive genital surgery should always be voluntary or therapeutic . 
  destructive child genital surgeries are more closely related issues than you seem to understand . 
  there are three very bad cultural ideas that male and female child genital surgeries share : 1 . the human genitalia evolved incorrectly 2 . these natural genital deficiencies can be corrected with destructive genital surgery and 3 . parents have a right to perform destructive , non-therapeutic body modifications on their children . 
  the damage in female genital surgery may be intentionally worse , but male genital surgeries amputate more tissue and kill far more boys every year . 
  they 're both awful traditions . 
  why does it have to be a competition ? 
  men in the us tend to be belligerently proud of our penis scars . 
  the amount of intentional damage from female genital cutting might be worse usually , but they are both destructive child genital surgeries . 
  child genital surgeries are inherently comparable . 
  people who say they 're incomparable do n't seem to understand what incomparable means . 
  saying that one is worse is comparing them . 
  they 're not just comparable , as far as anyone can tell , male child genital surgeries actually kill hundreds more children every year . 
  in a few provinces of south africa alone , 500 boys have died in the past 6 years , hundreds experienced penectomy and other gross mutilations and half a million needed to be hospitalized for their injuries . 
  traditional male child genital surgeries are a bigger public health crisis , yet they 're ignored by the us and un who are too busy promoting child genital surgery for boys to acknowledge any harm in male genital surgery . 
  men in the us are offended by the fact that the foreskin is a normal part of the human penis . 
  it 's so foreign to us here that most men consider the foreskin to look inhuman , like the human penis is somehow naturally deformed . 
  doctors in the us believe the foreskin has no purpose , so amputating it is harmless at worst . 
  there 's a simple reason for our doctors ' ignorance . 
  a canadian survey showed that most doctors who believe destructive infant genital surgery is worth doing are repeating what was done to them ( [ muller , 2010 ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s1875686710000503 ) ) . 
  it 's unbelievable how uninformed so many doctors can be about this , but this is the way it has been in the us since the early 20th century when child genital cutting was first adopted because it was believed to prevent masturbation . 
  there 's also an unbelievable amount of ignorance . 
  in the us , almost no one knows that the foreskin is usually the most sensitive part of the penis ( [ sorrells , 2007 ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2006.06685.x/abstract ) -- [ nsfw relevant diagram ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/sorrells.gif ) ) or that the majority of men with intact foreskin agree that it 's the best feeling part of the penis ( [ meislahn & taylor , 2004 ] ( http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-4011-0_3 ) ) . 
  cultural mutilations change cultural perception . 
  the altered cultural perception then makes it very difficult to stop doing them . 
  this problem of cultural misperception is the same with circumcision as with every cultural mutilation like tribal tattooing , scarification , foot binding or female genital cutting/mutilation . 
  living in the us my whole life , i only learned more about circumcision and how it 's a significant violation of children 's body autonomy after my boyfriend read about it and realized that he actually feels mutilated by his infant circumcision . 
  once you look at the foreskin as the normal part of the penis that it is , circumcised penises look like something painful happened to them . 
  the conspicuous feature that is the foreskin is replaced with a prominent scar . 
  it 's unbelievable that parents can do this to their children without any medical reason . 
  even in europe , where you would think people should know better , the only restrictions placed on male infant genital surgery are two or three countries require a physician to be present . 
  considering the fact that [ many european medical organizations oppose non-therapeutic infant genital surgery ] ( / r/intactivists/wiki / index #wiki _ medical_associations_against_involuntary_genital_cutting ) , why are n't there any restrictions placed on it ? 
  have you read any academic literature on female genital modification ? -- sorry -- female genital surgery/cutting/circumcision / mutilation . 
  \\* female genital surgery only came to be viewed as a human rights violation in the 1980s . 
  until the 1970s , it was still being promoted by doctors in the us for making it easier for a woman to orgasm ( * supposedly * ) . 
  in decades before that , it had been promoted for even more nefarious purposes like to reduce sexuality and prevent masturbation ( the same intent as most male surgery at the time ) . 
   as recently as the 1950s , physicians in the united kingdom and the united states also performed fc/fgm to `` treat '' hysteria , lesbianism , masturbation and other so-called `` female deviations . '', 
  -- [ * female genital mutilation : a practical guide to worldwide laws & policies * , rahman & toubia , 2000 ] ( http://books.google.com/books?id=keg6gaudxqec&amp;pg=pa7 ), 
  that 's just the journal that published the paper . 
  i did n't mention the authors because there are a lot of them . 
  you can read who authored the paper on the pdf if you 're interested . 
  in fact , i 'll extract the author list for you : abdulcadir j , ahmadu fs , catania l , essen b , gruenbaum e , johnsdotter s , johnson mc , johnson-agbakwu c , kratz c , sulkin cl , mckinley m , njambi w , rogers j , shell-duncan b , shweder ra . 
  if you 've ever read any of the academic literature an female genital modification , you should recognize some of those names . 
  have you read any academic literature on female genital modification ? 
  when asked about comparing male and female genital surgeries , ayaan hirsi ali , the author of * infidel * and herself a victim of female mutilation , said that male genital surgery is [ `` worse than incision of a girl '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naeoqvznn8i ) . 
  if the majority of female `` mutilation '' is only as destructive as male genital surgery ( or less destructive ) , why is male genital surgery still being legally sanctioned ? 
  male and female genital surgeries are both performed for the pernicious cultural idea that the human genitalia evolved incorrectly and parents should correct their children with surgery . 
  it 's the same cultural idea whether it 's applied to male or female children . 
  every culture that applies this logic to female children also applies it to male children . 
  for children of any sex , destructive genital surgeries are performed because culture makes parents think the human genitalia evolved incorrectly and that the child 's genitals need to be corrected with surgery . 
  this motivation is the same for both male and female child genital surgeries . 
  it 's less effective to oppose child genital surgery for only one sex . 
  it 's counterproductive to promote male genital surgery even while trying to eliminate female genital surgeries . 
  \\* a group of global experts on female genital mutilation wrote a paper about how the narrative of female genital surgeries that 's popular in the west is highly distorted . 
  the distorted mutilation narrative is standing in the way of the cultural dialog that could lead to cultural reform of genital surgery traditions , both male and female . 
  - the public policy advisory network on female genital surgeries in africa , `` seven things to know about female genital surgeries in africa , '' * hastings center report * , no . 
  -- [ pdf file ] ( http://www.taskforcefgm.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hast81.pdf ) -- [ excerpt in the / r/intactivists wiki ] ( / r/intactivists/wiki / index #wiki _ the_popular_perception_of_female_genital_surgeries_is_distorted ) \\* * most opponents of female genital surgeries have also been opposed to male genital surgeries because ultimately they 're very closely related ideas . 
  for example : hanny lightfoot-klein in * prisoners of ritual : an odyssey into female genital circumcision in africa * , 1989:193 :  the reasons given for female circumcision in africa and for routine male circumcision in the u.s. are essentially the same . 
  both falsely tout the positive health benefits of the procedures . 
  both promise cleanliness and the absence of `` bad '' genital odors , as well as greater attractiveness and acceptability of the sex organs . 
  the affected individuals in both cultures have come to view these procedures as something that was done for them and not to them . 
  nahid toubia , m.d. , sudanese physician , in fgm and responsibility of reproductive health professionals , * int ' l journal gynecology & obstetrics * , 46 ( 1994 ) pp . 
  127-135 :  the unnecessary removal of a functioning body organ in the name of tradition , custom or any other non-disease related cause should never be acceptable to the health profession . 
  all childhood circumcisions are violations of human rights and a breach of the fundamental code of medical ethics . 
  it is the moral duty of educated professionals to protect the health and rights of those with little or no social power to protect themselves .
