   cutting any healthy part of a child 's body , including the genitals , is wrong . 
  the female clitoris and the male foreskin should be guaranteed the same protections as the nose , the hand , or any other body part . 
  cultural and religious reasoning must be respected , reviewed , and possibly reformed on the basis of interpretation inspired by the values of social justice inherent to all cultures and religions . 
  we must respect all parts of our children 's bodies -- including their known and unknown functions -- whether on the basis of belief in their evolutionary necessity or the perfection of god 's creation . 
  medical reasons for cutting the genitals should be the same as those that govern surgery on other parts of the body . 
  they must be based on a clinically verifiable diagnosis of immediately life-threatening disease , injury , or deformity and not on notions of prophylaxis , be it moral ( to protect against sexual misconduct ) or physical ( to protect against unforeseeable disease ) .

  in a sense , just as the us was 100 years behind europe in coming to oppose female genital surgeries ( especially clitoridectomy ) , africa is apparently still another decade or two behind the us . 
  infibulation ( mentioned in op story ) is done in parts of somalia and uganda is very shocking and obviously senselessly destructive but it 's worth remembering that it makes up less than 10 % of female genital surgeries in africa . 
  there needs to be more focus on less destructive genital surgeries because that 's what the majority are . 
  every culture regards `` mutilation '' as something other cultures do . 
  they look at their own genital surgeries fondly . 
  this is as much a problem in the us with male surgery as it is with male and female genital surgery in many african and islamic countries . 
  do you think a child can be jewish if his foreskin is n't amputated without his consent ? 
  i feel sorry for a culture that thinks involuntary genital cutting defines itself . 
  did you realize that outside of circumcising cultures , nontherapeutic foreskin amputation is the anti-science position ? 
  a more interesting comparison between fetal abortion and foreskin amputation is that some of the biggest advocates of both these elective medical procedures have hailed from johns hopkins university . 
  along with the guttmacher institute and planned parenthood , johns hopkins has always been at the forefront of the medical promotion both involuntary foreskin amputation and fetal abortion . 
  \\* i 'm not taking any stance on abortion here , because i do n't know when human life begins . 
  i just think it 's remarkable that the same institution is largely responsible for both practices whenever people compare the practices to each other . 
  ... and it 's all illegal .

  i could continue listing reasons why you 're wrong , but you get the idea ? 
  as usual , someone from a genital cutting culture is somehow unable to comprehend fundamental similarities between male and female cultural genital modifications . 
  ( see how that sounds ? ), 
  i mentioned differing cultural definitions of mutilation , the potential minimalness of female child genital cutting , shared cultural justifications and parental motivations , the fact that boys are affected by cultural child genital cutting , and the uk medical community 's stance on male child genital cutting . 
  is that shoehorning male cutting into the debate on child genital cutting ? 
  child genital cutting/modification/mutilation is essentially one problem . 
  focusing on either to the complete exclusion of the other has divided the issue in people 's minds . 
  while no one questions the horrors of female child genital cutting , people are not aware of how minimal it can be in many cases and why it should be opposed on the basis of personal body autonomy , which is much more effective than trying to convince people their treasured cultural genital modifications are mutilation ( even when they obviously are ) . 
  ( for an example , consider how you feel about excising foreskins from boys . ), 
  to deny child genital modifications are the unitary problem they are , you might be ignoring or being ethically inconsistent about the significant fraction of female genital cutting that is less severe than those forms that receive the most attention . 
  there are forms of female genital cutting that are comparable to or objectively less severe than male genital cutting . 
  they 're also unethical but for violating the child 's personal body autonomy with the parents ' social or cultural considerations rather than for common negative sexual effects . 
  this was among the dutch medical association 's ( knmg ) considerations when they explained the issue of body autonomy in their [ 2010 statement on non-therapeutic circumcision ] ( http://knmg.artsennet.nl/publicaties/knmgpublicatie/77942/nontherapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-2010.htm )  the official viewpoint of knmg and other related medical/scientific organisations is that non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors is a violation of children 's rights to autonomy and physical integrity . 
   - non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors is contrary to the rule that minors may only be exposed to medical treatments if illness or abnormalities are present , or if it can be convincingly demonstrated that the medical intervention is in the interest of the child , as in the case of vaccinations . 
   - non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors conflicts with the child 's right to autonomy and physical integrity . 
   until a few years ago , the attitude towards circumcision was fairly permissive , and circumcision was legitimised by appealing to freedom of religion and supposed medical benefits . 
  in recent years , the attitude towards circumcision appears to have been changing . 
  this is probably partly the result of the debate about female genital mutilation ( fgm ) . 
  with the global condemnation of this practice , including in its non-mutilating , symbolic form , the question regularly arises why circumcision should be judged differently than fgm . 
  here 's what some dedicated anti-fgm activists have said about male genital cutting .

  - and here 's what some prominent feminists like alice walker , gloria steinem , shamis dirir and germaine greer have [ said or written about it ] ( http://www.noharmm.org/fgcsay.htm ) . 
  fgm is an unfortunately problematic term , and fgm traditions have been especially resistant to eradication in large part because `` mutilation '' does not mean the same thing to everyone . 
  female genital mutilation sounds like it would only refer to infibulation and severe clitoridectomy , the only female genital surgeries that seem to be widely regarded as mutilation ( without controversy ) . 
  in reality , it refers to any cultural genital surgery whether ritual or medicalized . 
  female child genital cutting includes surgeries that are objectively much less severe than male child genital cutting like non-excisive incision of the clitoral prepuce and/or clitoris . 
  it also includes surgeries that are like male genital cutting in excising only skin and membrane . 
  and even when clitoridectomy it performed , it 's often so minor that doctors ca n't tell whether surgery has been performed or not as many of these cases that have been heard in courts have shown ( including [ munby ( 2015 ) ] ( http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/02/on-the-supposed-distinction-between-culture-and-religion-a-comment-on-sir-james-munbys-decision-in-the-matter-of-b-and-g-children/ ) in the uk and the `` fgm '' [ case currently taking place in sydney ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/female-genital-mutilation-trial-doctor-says-removal-of-clitoris-part-was-medically-possible-20150917-gjoyr8.html ) ) . 
  just as some people consider the foreskin to be a deformity making destroying it kindness , they may regard parts of the female genitalia as unclean , unattractive and `` excessively fleshy . '', 
  this is not merely an idle , `` what about men ? '', 
  internet concern , supporters of female genital cutting in cultures with female cutting traditions have pointed to the hypocrisy of the acceptance for non-therapeutic male cutting . 
  `` american parents circumcise their newborns so that the sons will look like the fathers ... what , they ask , gives americans the right to apply a different standard to african women ? '', 
  as this question highlights , male genital cutting is not merely an ethical problem on its own right . 
  it is intimately tied to female genital cutting where female cutting is also traditional . 
  as hanny lightfoot-klein wrote : ` the [ main ] reasons given for female circumcision in africa and for routine male circumcision in the united states are essentially the same . 
  both promise cleanliness and the absence of odours as well as greater attractiveness and acceptability . ' as [ earp ( 2015 ) ] ( http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/male-and-female-circumcision-are-equally-wrong/ ) explained the ethical violation in child genital cutting is not ( and should not be ) based on any particular damage to sexual function or feeling of having been harmed by the surgery :  as the social anthropologist sara johnsdotter has pointed out , there is no one-to-one relationship between the amount of genital tissue removed ( in males , females , or indeed in intersex people ) , and either subjective satisfaction while having sex , or a feeling of having been personally harmed because one 's ` private parts ' were altered before one could effectively resist . 
  medically-unnecessary genital surgeries -- of whatever degree of severity -- will affect different people differently . 
  this is because each individual 's relationship to their own body is unique , including what they find aesthetically appealing , what degree of risk they feel comfortable taking on when it comes to elective surgeries on their reproductive organs , and even what degree of sexual sensitivity they prefer ( for personal or cultural reasons ) . 
  that 's why ethicists are beginning to argue that individuals should be left to decide what to do with their own genitals when it comes to irreversible surgery , whatever their sex or gender . 
  various forms of female genital cutting may be objectively much more damaging than cultural male genital cutting , but many others are not . 
  all cultural child genital surgeries are performed to normalize parts of the genitalia that are regarded as inappropriate or unnatural for cultural reasons . 
  in both cases , parents believe they are acting in the child 's interest by destroying part of the child 's genitals . 
  in both cases , unfortunately a majority of modified individuals consider their child genital surgeries to be enhancements and value the modification as a tradition keeping it alive for another generation . 
  some of europe 's national medical organizations have been better about recognizing the ethical problems with male child genital cutting as well , and have stated that it should be discouraged . 
  in information for parents about circumcision , the bma stated :  it is now widely accepted , including by the bma , that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks . 
  ... very similar arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural procedures , such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification . 
  furthermore , the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose not to be circumcised must also be taken into account , together with the damage that can be done to the individual 's relationship with his parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the procedure . 
  ... parental preference alone is not sufficient justification for performing a surgical procedure on a child . 
  while the bma has stated serious reservations with non-therapeutic child circumcision , they have not gone so far as to say that it should be discouraged like many other european medical organizations have .
