  as the second sentence of this article states , only 9 of these cases involved minors . 
  that 's obviously too many , but the headline is incredibly misleading . 
   the forskin has no feeling someone who was only informed by us , muslim and/or african medical authorities might be forgiven for believing such nonsense . 
  in the us , medical authorities misinform us about this .

  cultural/religious male and female genital cutting are even more similar than you have explained . 
  they are fundamentally similar for both destroying erogenous parts of children 's genitalia . 
  as you noted , there are forms of female genital cutting that are much less severe than male genital cutting including wholly non-excisive forms . 
  people from cultures that cut girls and boys alike find it hypocritical that they are permitted to cut their sons but they 're not permitted to cut their daughters . 
  supporters of female genital cutting have pointed directly to the hypocrisy of us child genital surgery standards : `` american parents circumcise their newborns so that the sons will look like the fathers ... what , they ask , gives americans the right to apply a different standard to african women ? '', 
  the idea that the intact penis is too fleshy , unclean , unattractive , immoral , and/or `` unnatural '' is essentially identical to the idea that the unmodified vulva has exactly the same negative qualities . 
  the purposes of both male and female surgeries are identical : to achieve the modified aesthetic and to simplify hygiene by simplifying the genitalia . 
  they are performed at around the same age in similar conditions in cultures where both surgeries are traditional . 
  female , male and intersex child genital cutting are all unethical because they are performed on children to `` normalize '' their genitalia for social , cultural or religious reasons . 
  numerous anti-fgm activists have opposed male circumcision as well .

  anti-fgm activist and sudan 's first female surgeon , [ nahid toubia ( 1999 ) ] ( http://books.google.com/books?id=ljzz9zvd_kqc&amp;pg=pa1 ) wrote :  cutting any healthy part of a child 's body , including the genitals , is wrong . 
  the female clitoris and the male foreskin should be guaranteed the same protections as the nose , the hand , or any other body part . 
  cultural and religious reasoning must be respected , reviewed , and possibly reformed on the basis of interpretation inspired by the values of social justice inherent to all cultures and religions . 
  we must respect all parts of our children 's bodies -- including their known and unknown functions -- whether on the basis of belief in their evolutionary necessity or the perfection of god 's creation . 
  medical reasons for cutting the genitals should be the same as those that govern surgery on other parts of the body . 
  they must be based on a clinically verifiable diagnosis of immediately life-threatening disease , injury , or deformity and not on notions of prophylaxis , be it moral ( to protect against sexual misconduct ) or physical ( to protect against unforeseeable disease ) . 
  and as 15 fgm researchers collectively wrote in `` seven things to know about female genital surgeries in africa '' :  the widely publicized and sensationalized reproductive health and medical complications associated with female genital surgeries in africa are infrequent events and represent the exception rather than the rule . 
   female genital surgeries in africa are viewed by many insiders as aesthetic enhancements of the body and are not judged to be `` mutilations . '', 
   customary [ child genital ] surgeries are not restricted to females . 
  in ... societies where there are customary female genital surgeries , there are also customary male genital surgeries at similar ages and for parallel reasons . 
  ... as a broad generalization , it seems fair to say that societies for whom genital surgeries are normal and routine are not singling out females as targets of punishment , sexual deprivation , or humiliation . 
  a fundamental purpose of both surgeries is to simplify hygiene by simplifying the genitalia . 
  they are performed at around the same age in similar conditions in cultures where both surgeries are traditional . 
  put simply , the idea that the unmodified penis is excessively fleshy and that it is ethical to destroy the most sensitive skin of the penis for negligible benefits is closely related to the idea that the vulva is too fleshy and that it is ethical for parents to destroy some of its most sensitive parts . 
  as [ earp ( 2014 ) ] ( http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/male-and-female-circumcision-are-equally-wrong/ ) wrote :  as the social anthropologist sara johnsdotter has pointed out , there is no one-to-one relationship between the amount of genital tissue removed ( in males , females , or indeed in intersex people ) , and either subjective satisfaction while having sex , or a feeling of having been personally harmed because one 's ` private parts ' were altered before one could effectively resist . 
  medically-unnecessary genital surgeries -- of whatever degree of severity -- will affect different people differently . 
  this is because each individual 's relationship to their own body is unique , including what they find aesthetically appealing , what degree of risk they feel comfortable taking on when it comes to elective surgeries on their reproductive organs , and even what degree of sexual sensitivity they prefer ( for personal or cultural reasons ) . 
  that 's why ethicists are beginning to argue that individuals should be left to decide what to do with their own genitals when it comes to irreversible surgery , whatever their sex or gender .

'', 
  this policy has been endorsed by other dutch medical organizations including : the netherlands society of general practitioners , the netherlands society of youth healthcare physicians , the netherlands association of paediatric surgeons , the netherlands association of plastic surgeons , the netherlands association for paediatric medicine , the netherlands urology association , and the netherlands surgeons ' association .

  in the us , clitoral prepuce/hood surgeries ( termed `` female circumcision '' ) were popularized along with male circumcision in the early 20th century . 
  it never became as popular as male cutting though . 
  these ideas slowly became less popular with us doctors but they persisted even until the 1970s though it was only for cosmetic purposes by then . 
  in 1958 , c. f. mcdonald said `` the same reasons that apply for the circumcision of males are generally valid when considered for the female . '', 
  in 1959 , w. g. rathmann found that among the benefits of female circumcision , it cured psychosomatic illnesses and marital problems and would `` make the clitoris easier to find '' for the husband .
