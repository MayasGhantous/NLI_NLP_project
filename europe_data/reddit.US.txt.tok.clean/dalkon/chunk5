   nope , there is not actually . 
  did you read the second article i linked about the `` sharp rise '' in halal abattoirs slaughtering without stunning because of the growing traditional slaughter movement ? 
  the islamic anti-stunning movement is more culturally isolating than banning cruel methods of slaughter , is n't it ? 
   if you 're referring to the stunning issue , it is ok for islam . 
  there 's actually a lot of disagreement about that , is n't there ? 
  globally , only some halal abattoirs have converted to pre-stunning , but most do not . 
  \\* apparently in the uk , [ most do ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11378667/sharp-rise-in-halal-abattoirs-slaughtering-animals-without-stunning-them-first.html ) , but there is a growing traditionalist anti-stunning movement of people who believe that stunning is not halal . 
  as far as most contemporary economists are concerned , repairing all the destruction and waste in war is indistinguishable from economic growth . 
  the idea that repairing destruction is economic growth is called the broken window fallacy ( not to be confused with the theory of the same name ) . 
  it was first advanced by bastiat in 1850 . 
  do you think the longstanding us led attempt to destroy assad 's regime made it more or less difficult for is/daesh to invade syria ? 
  french people , how does the affect how you feel about your government 's involvement in syria ? 
  does this make you want your military to be more or less involved in syria ? 
  i also wonder if this makes any us policy makers regret all our attempts to overthrow assad destabilizing syria since 2010 with sanctions , attacks and arming `` rebels '' ( or whoever takes our weapons ) . 
  haha . 
  it was just a joke .

  new york city 's health department tried ~ ~ banning ~ ~ \\* restricting it in only the most minor way possible by requiring parents to sign a consent form that simply stated that they consented to the surgery being performed . 
  ( notably no one has ever tried to ban it . 
  ) \\* after a number of months they decided they did n't have the authority to do so even though courts had upheld their right to do so . 
  i hope so , and you would think we would have to , but powerful cultural memes like child genital surgery rarely evolve the way one would assume . 
  for instance most people in the us look at the role of evolution in genital surgery in perfect opposition to how you view it . 
  americans tend to assume the foreskin must be a deformity therefore destroying it is `` evolution '' ( rather than a bizarre cultural superstition ) . 
  part of the problem seems to be that most americans are n't aware how much more minimal and organized the foreskin is than they had ignorantly assumed ( [ for example ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jill-di-donato/circumcised-or-uncircumcised-sex_b_1380359.html ) ) . 
  in the us , peter remondino , a popular doctor and medical publisher promoted the idea genital surgery was evolution in the 19th century ( his logic being because we wear clothes now ) , and a psychologist was promoting the idea as recently as 2003 . 
  the psychologist 's logic was the highly implausible theory that the foreskin was such an evolutionary disadvantage because it could allow impregnation from another man 's semen in the orgies of primitive man the psychologist imagined that it made destroying it `` evolution . '', 
  genital surgery seems to affect perception . 
  that seems to be a large part of why overcoming cultural genital surgery has taken so long . 
  without any knowledge of the subject , it may be easy to see this as a non-issue and feel like defending what our culture does because cutting seems natural to us ( in the us ) . 
  what we 're ignoring is that the foreskin does n't just contribute to the sensitivity of the glans , it is also very sensitive in itself . 
  the foreskin is more sensitive and normally feels better than the less sensitive foremost two thirds of the glans ( [ sorrells , 2007 ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2006.06685.x/abstract ) ; [ meislahn & taylor , 2004 ] ( http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-4011-0_3 ) ; [ podnar , 2012 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21883821 ) ; [ bronselaer , 2013 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374102 ) ; [ van howe , 2013 ] ( http://books.google.com/books?id=nb9eaaaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa29 ) ) . 
  can you see how genital cutting would still be unethical for girls even when it 's only cutting skin and membrane like male cutting ? 
  that 's why male cutting is unethical too . 
  members of that small committee have also subsequently stated they were largely concerned with defending the surgery from growing questions of its ethics ( which of course they also avoided discussing to any meaningful extent in their statement ) . 
  this is a topic where fundamentalist religious bias has always been allowed to enter and to influence the discussion as it were not fundamentalist religious bias . 
  there 's nothing as politically charged as tribal/cultural/religious child surgery . 
  the aap has a history of making spurious child genital surgery recommendations . 
  the aap only discovered how strongly people felt about girl 's right to body autonomy [ when they suggested allowing minor female genital cutting ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2010/health/05/27/aap.retracts.female.genital.cutting/index.html ) to be performed by doctors in hospitals in order to prevent more destructive surgeries from being performed on girls by medically unqualified people . 
  body autonomy supersedes utilitarian analysis for girls . 
  our regard for the body autonomy of girls is so high it makes many consider medicalized and even undetectable involuntary surgical modifications of girls unethical . 
  how is it considered ethical to hold boys to such a radically different standard ? 
  if appeals to authority mean more than the obvious ethics , european medical authorities have disagreed . 
  the [ danish medical association ( l\u00e6geforeningen ) ] ( http://www.laeger.dk/nyhed/download/docs/f14151/h%c3%b8ringssvar%20om%20vejledningsudkast%20om%20omsk%c3%a6ring%20af%20drenge.pdf ) and [ danish society of family physicians ( dsam ) ] ( http://www.dsam.dk/flx/forsiden/nyheder/kommentar-til-vejledning-om-omskaering-af-drenge/ ) recommended non-therapeutic male circumcision should be restricted to being performed only with personal rather than parental consent . 
  in 2013 , the [ nordic association of clinical sexology ] ( http://www.nacs.eu/data/press_release001.pdf ) wrote :  the penile foreskin is a natural and integral part of the normal male genitalia . 
  the foreskin has a number of important protective and sexual functions . 
  it protects the penile glans against trauma and contributes to the natural functioning of the penis during sexual activity . 
  ... the foreskin is a functional and highly sensitive , erogenous structure , capable of providing pleasure to its owner and his potential partners . 
   as clinical sexologists , we are concerned about the human rights aspects associated with the practice of non-therapeutic circumcision of young boys . 
  to cut off the penile foreskin in a boy with normal , healthy genitalia deprives him of his right to grow up and make his own informed decision . 
  unless there are compelling medical reasons to operate before a boy reaches an age and a level of maturity at which he is capable of providing informed consent , the decision to alter the appearance , sensitivity and functionality of the penis should be left to its owner , thus upholding his fundamental rights to protection and bodily integrity . 
   every person 's right to bodily integrity goes hand in hand with his or her sexual autonomy . 
  [ ritual circumcision ban recommended in sweden and denmark by medical associations ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/27/circumcision-ban-sweden-denmark_n_4674547.html )  the sweden medical association , which counts 85 % of the country 's physicians as members , recommended setting twelve as the minimum age for the procedure and requiring a boy 's consent in a resolution which was unanimously passed by the ethics council , reported the svenska dagbladet . 
  the danish college of general practitioners , a group with 3,000 members , made a statement that ritual circumcision of boys was tantamount to abuse and mutilation , according to danish newspaper bt . 
  they polled their readers and found that 87 % were in favor of a ban on non-medical circumcision . 
  `` curing '' masturbation was part of it , but it was really more the fact that there has just been a huge amount of circumcision propaganda in the us starting with the first president of the ama , lewis sayre who claimed circumcision might cure basically anything , so it was at least worth trying in every case . 
  he eventually changed his mind , but he published his newer reservations much less enthusiastically than he had his original error . 
  then there people like peter remondino claimed the foreskin caused masturbation . 
  american medicine was horrible when circumcision was first popularized , but after it was popular , there was no going back at least not without research about the foreskin which would not begin to be produced until the 1990s . 
  it 's a pretty wild chapter of history . 
  [ from ritual to science : the medical transformation of circumcision in america ] ( http://www.cirp.org/library/history/gollaher/ ) .

  did you know that the ritual surgery included oral contact until the 19th century ? 
  mbp was an official part of the ritual . 
  german jewish doctors totally reformed it against a huge amount of resistance to change . 
  a md who later became a jewish historian wrote a book about the history of the tradition in 2005 https://books.google.com/books/about/marked_in_your_flesh.html?id=sf6fbjne0yyc, 
  that was n't what the study you 're thinking of ( bossio 2016 ) actually found . 
  like other studies that actually looked at the foreskin at all , they also found that the foreskin was the most sensitive area of the penis , they just did n't find the sensitivity of * the rest of the penis * changed much from excising it . 
  that actually agrees with all previous studies . 
  bossio spun it into circumcision propaganda though because that 's her thing . 
  one of her techniques for making her study better circumcision propaganda was the standard circumcision propaganda of defining the penis as not having foreskin , therefore removing that significant part of the sensitivity of the penis has no effect on her definition of `` the penis . '', 
  this article explains this and some other points about circumcision research http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-earp/does-circumcision-reduce-_b_9743242.html, 
  or even more comparable , there are forms of female child genital cutting that only cut skin and membrane . 
  some consider such surgeries religious . 
  what 's the ethical difference between that and male cutting ? 
  male cutting is more destructive than a number of forms of female genital cutting ( that are usually ignored in the discussion about the issue ) . 
  rebels or `` rebels ? '', 
  most of the us military equipment for `` iraq '' actually going to isis might highlight the point that it would be foolish to take our governments ' word for who they say they 're arming . 
  that was just the first article i saw that was from before paris . 
  i 'd be surprised if there were n't a lot more like it that say the uk did more than talk to them . 
  should i look ? 
  is that in question ? 
  my point was that because the uk played some role in syria before any other eu state did , their paying for the cost of the crisis is slightly less unfair than it is for the rest of the eu . 
  i made that point too strongly originally though , so thank you for the correction . 
  if the world were fair , the us and other countries involved ( especially those who benefited ) would deal with any humanitarian crisis they caused instead just causing these enormous disasters with no regard for consequences and then expecting europe to be generous . 
  caring about destroying peoples ' lives might have stopped some governments ' big plans for rebel-assisted regime change in syria .

  the uk took part in the us plan to overthrow assad by aiding the rebellion which , along with russia 's aid to assad , made the syrian refugee crisis the size it is . 
  did any other european countries ? 
  why does the rest of europe want to pay for the foolish regime changing rebellion their governments were not so foolish as to support ?
