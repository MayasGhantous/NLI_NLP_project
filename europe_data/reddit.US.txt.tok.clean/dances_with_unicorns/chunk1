that 's nice in theory , but the problem is that under the franchise system there are neither incentives nor means for the individual franchise holder to improve the network . 
  so , high-speed rail in the uk is still considerably behind what france and germany have been doing , and there 's still no train going directly to edinburgh airport ( you have to take a bus from haymarket , waverley , or inverkeithing , generally adding another half hour or so to your journey ) . 
  on the plus side , british trains are still more punctual than amtrak ( though that 's mostly just because they do n't give freight trains constant priority over passenger trains ) . 
  mind you , it 's not that i 've found the experience in britain all that bad ( the trains are still clean and reasonably punctual ) , but it does n't compare to the french tgv or the german ice . 
  `` fair game '' is a precise translation of `` freiwild '' . 
  they literally mean one and the same thing and have the same figurative uses and connotations . 
  `` game '' in particular refers to animals hunted for sport or food , as well as their meat . 
   sorry but its internal eu matter , no un mandate required . 
  sending troops to lybia ( as the gp suggested ) would most definitely not be an internal matter for the eu . 
   eritrea is not sub-saharan check [ a map ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6492961.stm ) ? 
   and you can be pretty much sure the refugees are not crossing sahara on foot . 
  did n't say so . 
  [ does n't help ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/niger/10421186/rising-risk-of-desert-migrant-deaths-as-more-africans-try-to-reach-europe.html ) . 
   boko haram has been beaten back . 
  also , the country is huge , hundreds of thousands can be easily accomodated there . 
  the conflict is still [ very much ongoing ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/18/un-says-14m-children-have-fled-boko-haram-extremists ) and refugees have been scattered across the region . 
  while boko haram have moved to more of a guerrilla type of war , that does n't make the civilian population safe and it will take some time for things to return to normal . 
   well , there is a huge country next door with a presently well-developing economy . 
  can they not go there ? 
  ethiopia is already flooded with refugees ( primarily from south sudan ) and is pretty poor . 
  nobody from sub-saharan africa comes to europe unless they are desperate . 
  they first have to cross the sahara , where many die of thirst , and then somehow have to make it across the mediterranean . 
  the vast majority of african refugees stay in africa . 
  eritrea is one of the worst totalitarian countries in existence ; it 's been described as africa 's north korea . 
  there are few refugees who are more legitimate than eritreans fleeing from their regime . 
  nigeria is dealing with [ boko haram ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_baga_massacre ) , with hundreds of thousands of displaced persons resulting from the conflict . 
  the third major country of origin for refugees is somalia , still ravaged by an ongoing civil war , resulting in over a million refugees and displaced persons . 
  the fourth largest source of refugees from africa is mali , another country with an ongoing civil war . 
  there is a reason why there are literally [ millions of refugees and displaced persons in africa ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4a02d7fd6.html ) . 
  same in syria . 
  does n't give you permission to start an invasion . 
  and you 'll secure a un mandate for that how ? 
  because otherwise , conquering part of a sovereign country to resettle people there would be just slightly incompatible with international law . 
  the article does n't actually talk about refugee camps ; he vaguely mentions `` safe places in africa '' and `` their home regions '' . 
  it would also likely require a constitutional amendment that he ca n't expect to get passed in the upper house even if he gets the social democrats to agree . 
  i do n't think this is an actual policy proposal ; he 's most likely playing to his party 's base . 
  in any event , any country in africa that is safe is [ already packed with refugees ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4a02d7fd6.html ) . 
  they 'll say , `` thanks but no thanks . '', 
  this is [ nothing new ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/working_opportunities_with_additional_expenses_compensation ) . 
  it 's been part of hartz iv since its inception ( though i do n't recall when exactly it was opened up for asylum seekers ) . 
  note that this is mostly limited to charitable and non-profit work . 
  this is because under the law these activities must not compete with regular employment . 
  certain kinds of work for for-profit enterprises may still qualify . 
  the goal is to give people something to do so that they do n't sit around all day [ 1 ] . 
  the compensation of one euro per hour ( actually $ 1 - $ 2.50 per hour ) is meant to offset additional costs such as getting to work and clothing wear and tear . 
  [ 1 ] much of the criticism of the program in the hartz iv context comes from its workfare aspects ; i.e. 
  when it is non-optional and when long-term unemployed people are ordered to participate or lose their benefits . 
  this does not apply here . 
   however , if they do qualify , greece has to give them citizenship and they can then simply move elsewhere in the eu . 
  even if they could , that would likely backfire . 
  the right to reside is contingent upon your ability to support yourself ( or have family and friends support you adequately ) . 
  if you ca n't , then other eu countries can kick you out and your country of citizenship is on the hook for supporting you . 
  currently , refugees can not be sent back to greece under dublin ; however , greek citizens who can not support themselves could most definitely be sent back . 
  the 2 % requirement is a totally arbitrary target with no connection to reality . 
  europe ( i.e. 
  not even counting the us or canada ) is outspending any power that could conceivably be a military threat several times over . 
  and that 's not counting that with russia being a nuclear power , possible threat scenarios change radically . 
  the actual problem that several countries face is that they need to spend their money more wisely instead of just spending more . 
  germany , for example , needs to fix its logistics and procurement issues ( broomsticks ftl ) . 
   and in a circumstance like that maybe the law should be looked at as in need of an update ? 
  the law already allows for the preventive detention of certain dangerous offenders even after they 've completed their prison sentence ( in theory even indefinitely ) . 
  in this case , the court did n't decide to do this , but settled for post-release supervision with an ankle bracelet . 
  this honestly seems to be more of a case of hindsight being 20/20 ; we have no idea how dangerous he actually appeared to be when he was released . 
  that 's not what i was saying . 
  germany could bump its sentences up to us levels in * general * , but i do n't think they want to ( say ) trade their homicide levels for those of the us . 
  in general , their criminal justice system seems to be working relatively well when it comes to preventing violent crime . 
  and they can not just bump up the sentencing for this one person in particular , nor can they just randomly keep him locked up without cause . 
  german law does allow for continued preventive detention of certain dangerous offenders after a completed prison term , but apparently he did n't qualify . 
  you ca n't just detain somebody in the us indefinitely , either , just because you think he 's a threat or even if there 's an order for deportation that can not be executed ( [ zadvydas v. davis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zadvydas_v._davis ) ) . 
  this guy was sentenced to eight years in prison for participating in a conspiracy to commit murder and membership in a terrorist organization . 
  he seems to have served the sentence in full ( once you account for pre-trial detention ) . 
  the crime did n't justify a life sentence and it would have been really hard to make a case for preventive detention after completion of the sentence , it appears . 
  he was under post-release supervision ( hence the electronic ankle bracelet ) , which can be extended indefinitely if there is evidence that the person may be dangerous . 
  it 's bild . 
  the one `` newspaper '' that can make the daily mail look good in comparison . 
  no , that was not the point . 
  the point was whether terrorists would want to acquire a forged syrian passport . 
  you were talking about potential terrorists a moment ago , now you 're talking about asylum seekers in munich ? 
  where 's the connection ? 
  my point , as you may recall , was that forged syrian passports are n't really a good choice for terrorists . 
  what that has to do with actual asylum seekers , i do not know . 
  not quite . 
  a prison sentence of 3 + years makes deportation mandatory , but any non-suspended prison sentence * can * result in a deportation ( [ \u00a7 53 ( 1 ) , \u00a7 54 ( 1 ) aufenthg ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/englisch_aufenthg.html#p0688 ) ) unless you 've been lawfully present for 5 + years ( \u00a7 56 ) . 
  it must also have been an intentional crime ; crimes committed out of negligence do not result in deportation . 
  the principle of non-refoulement usually still prevents deportation in the case of refugees . 
  yeah , it seems to be a statistical outlier . 
  and even if not , it would be at best an ... umm , micro-surge ? 
  that said , it * has * surprised me that the afd has n't been moving up in the polls at least a bit . 
   i did not show sympathy to him . 
  and i never claimed that . 
  another misrepresentation . 
   what 's important is , you used that case to make a point . 
  a point about the definition of helplessness under german law that you carefully ignored because you could n't refute it . 
  instead , you tried to move the goalposts . 
   she lied infront of the court . 
  they let her no stand as it is to save face . 
  this new claim is fascinating , because it 's simply an unproven assertion you make and you have n't made an argument to support it . 
  there is no evidence in the record that she said anything that was untrue . 
  nothing she said was contradicted , either by other witnesses , by the rest of her own testimony , or by circumstantial evidence . 
  also , i 'm not sure if you 're realizing it , but namecalling does not make you look more convincing ; instead , it looks like you 're trying to distract from an argument that you can not win .
