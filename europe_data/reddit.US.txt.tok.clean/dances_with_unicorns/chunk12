  alternatively , grow a sense of empathy and think about what can reasonably be done for innocent victims of senseless violence . 
  [ 1 ] the iraq war created is , which , as you may recall , is a major player in the syrian civil war and currently holds most of the parts of syria not in government hands . 
  there was plenty of [ resistance in denmark ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_resistance_movement ) . 
  most importantly , the danish resistance managed to [ save almost all the jews in denmark ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rescue_of_the_danish_jews ) ( [ memorialized in song by fred small ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ondboiwzsdq ) ) . 
  this is actually a bit of a downside of living in the us . 
  over here , my husband and i can get away with just having one car ( which is collecting dust in the garage much of the time ) , use public transit and bike and walk , while in america with two jobs we 'd probably need two cars ( and i think with a household income of about $ 120k we do qualify as middle class ) . 
  so , despite the higher gas prices over here , we do actually save a fair amount of money and live a healthier life . 
  in part this is of course because america has a much lower population density than germany ( which is where we live now ) , so it is much more difficult to have decent public transit in the us outside of the major metropolitan areas . 
  but in part it is indeed because there 's a stereotype that public transit is for the poor . 
   unless you plan on working at mcdonald 's part-time you 'll have maternity leave , paid vacation , healthcare , etc. 
  the bls [ is n't quite as optimistic as you ] ( http://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-2/paid-leave-in-private-industry-over-the-past-20-years.htm ) when it comes to paid maternity/family leave . 
  and while any decent job offers paid vacation , average vacation time is [ considerably less in the us ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/06/08/countries-most-vacation-days/2400193/ ) than in the rest of the developed world . 
  healthcare should be sort of on par post-ppaca ( other than network restrictions , which are still uniquely american ) , assuming the supreme court does n't manage to mess it up still . 
  you 'll pay more , and you pay more out of pocket , but you pay less in taxes . 
  america is a pretty darn nice place to live if you are single and have a good income ; europe ( or at least the better parts of europe ) tends to come out on top if you have a family and/or are poor/lower middle class ( which may not mean working for mcdonalds , but simply being a single earner family because you ca n't afford daycare and a second car ) . 
  there are really only three ways in which you can lose money on government-issued bonds . 
  ( 1 ) the issuing government defaults . 
  note that the qe program focuses on buying bonds from economically stable countries ; it 's not buying up greek bonds [ 1 ] . 
  if germany , italy , france , or spain were to default and their economy implode , the eurozone would have much , much bigger problems . 
  for what it 's worth , they 're not realistically going to let greece default , either , but greece exiting the euro is at least a hypothetical possibility [ 2 ] . 
  note that afaik the ecb has n't bought any greek bonds as part of its qe program yet . 
  they may eventually do so ( in modest amounts ) , assuming that the situation in greece allows for it . 
  right now , however , the ecb is primarily buying bonds from the bigger euro countries , most of them from germany . 
  i stress again that there are plenty of things that can go wrong with the qe program , but any government defaulting on its bonds ( other than the greek one ) is n't a realistic concern . 
  ( 2 ) inflation . 
  actually , the ecb wants to hit a higher inflation target . 
  that 'd be a good thing . 
  this is a case where a central bank is in a different situation compared to a private investor . 
  ( 3 ) you can obtain much higher interest rates elsewhere because the economy is growing again . 
  this is not so much a loss , but an opportunity cost ( which the ecb does n't really care about the same way a private investor would ) . 
  mostly , the ecb would break out the champagne if that actually happened . 
  [ 1 ] the ecb did buy billions of greek junk-rated bonds a in 2010-2012 , but that was a different program -- essentially debt relief -- , not qe . 
  [ 2 ] which would happen only if the rest of the eurozone agreed that letting greece leave would have lower costs than continuing to support it ; that would also take any remaining greek debt into account . 
  no , i mean a legislative act that changes the constitution . 
  i wish it were n't so , but that 's the way it is . 
  the greek crisis is only a relatively small part of the euromess . 
  it keeps making headlines because it 's a problem that does n't have an easy solution : the problem is that it is [ impossible for greece to pay its debt back ] ( https://medium.com/bull-market/greece-surplus-stimulus-and-strategy-e7532522e192 ) , so there 's going to be a lot of political theater during the next few years where the eu is trying to figure out how to arrive at a politically palatable solution . 
  that is going to be painful , but compared to the ongoing problems in italy , spain , portugal , and france , it 's still something that 's manageable . 
  in purely actuarial terms , the whole greek public debt could be written off easily enough ( or at least enough of it to put it back at manageable level ) ; it 's only a tiny fraction of the total public debt of the eurozone . 
  it 's a political question in that spain and italy would rightfully ask why greece should be privileged in such a way ; and there 's the moral hazard concern , too . 
  these issues are what make it a politically intractable problem . 
  however , the economic crisis caused by the conservative obsession with austerity is much , much bigger than greece . 
  it affects every single country in the eurozone directly and several outside of it indirectly ( and the uk is responsible for its own austerity-induced pain , though somewhat moderated by the bank of england 's own qe program ) . 
  it has created a credit crunch everywhere , keeping investment low and unemployment high . 
  and , of course , interest rates are also low as a result . 
  that 's where the paradox of thrift occurs ; economic growth is anemic throughout the eurozone . 
  this is probably a confusion over terminology in that the ecb is buying bonds ( at least according to what i can hear on the news ) , which are [ among the safest investments you can make ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/the-risks-of-sovereign-bonds.asp ) . 
  which is why even spanish and italian bonds have a [ ridiculously low yield ] ( http://markets.ft.com/research/markets/government-bond-spreads ) at the moment . 
  however , bonds still represent sovereign debt . 
  no , you can thank [ wolfgang sch\u00e4uble and his allies for that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paradox_of_thrift ) . 
  the whole point of the qe process is to kickstart liquidity/lending =  investment/economic growth =  interest . 
  whether that will still work is an open question ; while qe helped pull the us out of the recession , the conditions in europe are somewhat different , and recovering from years of self-imposed austerity and its consequences is not going to be easy . 
  nope . 
  at least not in the sense that `` printing money '' is traditionally used . 
  quantitative easing means that a central bank creates money and then purchases assets with that money . 
  the difference to what happened in zimbabwe or weimar -- where governments printed money in order to irreversibly spend it , e.g. 
  on reparations in the case of weimar -- is that this process is reversible ; not only can the central bank sell the assets back ( and then destroy the money ) , this happens pretty much automatically when the purchased assets mature . 
  why would a central bank do this ? 
  somewhat simplified , because there 's too little money in circulation . 
  note that the central bank only creates base money , normally a minority of the total money supply ; the majority of money is created when banks lend money through the so-called [ fractional reserve banking ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fractional-reserve_banking#money_creation_process ) process . 
  when banks stop lending , the money supply starts drying up , and businesses and households run into liquidity problems because they ca n't get loans ( google europe + credit crunch ) . 
  the basic idea behind qe is that the central bank steps in and injects liquidity in the market in order to counter this ; then , once the market has recovered and the normal m2 money creation process through bank lending is working again , to take the excess money out of circulation again . 
  note that just because the process is reversible does not mean that nothing can go wrong . 
  for starters , anytime you inject trillions of money into an economy , this can have unpredictable effects . 
  in order to change the * meaning * of the article , a constitutional amendment is required . 
  nobody else has the power to override what the parliamentary council established in 1949 . 
  that might conceivably take the step of saying that they now mean to include same-sex marriage and otherwise leave the wording unchanged , but a legislative act is still necessary . 
  it does n't , but there 's no doubt among legal scholars that this was the legislative intent and that the word marriage in article 6 of the basic law can not be interpreted to include gay marriage . 
  remember that article 6 was drafted in 1949 , when homosexuality was still a crime in germany . 
  fortunately , the federal constitutional court ruled that article 6 does not mean that the legislative can not create a civil union for gay couples with the exact same rights and responsibilities that a marriage provides ; in fact , it has repeatedly held ( unanimously , including the conservative judges ) that it is unconstitutional to discriminate against gay couples by giving them less rights in such a union compared to a marriage . 
  it was n't that they did n't want to do more , but they could n't . 
  same-sex marriage not only requires a constitutional amendment , even the civil unions had to be watered down initially because [ the conservative majority in the bundesrat did n't consent ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz#verabschiedung_des_lebenspartnerschaftsgesetzes ) . 
  it would require a constitutional amendment ( = 2/3 majority in both houses of the german parliament ) . 
  edit : the one thing that can be done without such a majority is to give civil unions the exact same rights as married couples , and this is likely to happen anyway ( because the german federal constitutional court takes a dim view of discrimination ) . 
  but in order to call it marriage , [ article 6 of the german constitution ] ( http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/gg.htm#6 ) has to be amended . 
   yes but as long as they are not violent it is still protected by free speech laws . 
  but violence is being alleged , up to and including involvement of party officials in a [ racially motivated serial murder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nsu_trial ) . 
  there 's probably a misunderstanding here , but you ca n't ban a political party in germany just because they hold or express radical ideas ( or ideals ) . 
  a ban also requires the party acting on this belief ; in essence , when it rises to the level of a criminal conspiracy . 
  conceptually , the goal is similar to that of 18 usc \u00a7 241 . 
  there are a number of rather silly anti-speech laws in germany , but this really is n't one of them ( at least not in principle ) . 
  the reason why the german government [ 1 ] has been moving for a ban is that the npd is said to have actively supported -- supported as in `` providing opportunity and/or means '' , not just verbal support -- racially and ethnically motivated crimes ( such as the nsu murders ) . 
  [ some people , including a former judge at the federal constitutional court , have expressed doubts ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2013-12/bundesverfassungsgericht-karlsruhe-npd-verbot ) that the government can prove anything beyond the mere expression of anti-constitutional ideas ( a previous attempt in 2004 failed for related reasons ) , which would cause the federal constitutional court to rule against a ban [ 2 ] . 
  this is not to say , of course , that this provision can not be abused ; the previous ban of the kpd ( the old communist party of germany ) during germany 's own mccarthy-esque era had some rather questionable aspects . 
  [ 1 ] strictly speaking , the process was initiated by the bundesrat , the upper house of the german parliament . 
  [ 2 ] a separate concern is that driving the npd underground may be counterproductive , but that is unrelated to freedom of speech issues . 
  the thing is that there 's not a single measure for unemployment ; this is not about `` a journalist reading statistics wrong '' but simply a matter of different metrics being used . 
  eurostat ( which is where the numbers are from ) uses a [ different definition ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/glossary:unemployment ) than the german government ( which uses the definition in [ \u00a7 16 sgb iii ] ( http://dejure.org/gesetze/sgb_iii/16.html ) ) . 
  the eurostat values are based on ilo standards and are therefore suitable for a comparison between countries , whereas the german government 's numbers are not . 
  eurostat also does n't obtain its data from the national governments , but conducts [ its own survey ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/glossary:labour_force_survey_%28lfs%29 ) . 
  yup , which is why i noted that i 'd only qualify that slightly ; i did n't mean to express disagreement . 
  i 'd qualify that slightly by saying that edinburgh ( banks ) and aberdeen ( oil ) are also significant economic centers ( though not on the same level as london ) , but yeah , that 's basically it . 
  this reform attempt predates the cologne events . 
  it was motivated by the well-known problem that under german law it has often been hard to prosecute rape ; an attempt to prosecute rape could fail , for example , because the victim did not physically resist ( say , because she was afraid ) or did not resist enough . 
  if you speak german , [ here ] ( https://www.frauen-gegen-gewalt.de/fallanalyse-zu-schutzluecken-im-sexualstrafrecht.html ) is a study that examines some of these problems using actual cases . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.jurawelt.com/sunrise/media/mediafiles/13792/tenea_juraweltbd52_kieler.pdf ) is a dissertation that ( inter alia ) discusses the case law ( esp . 
  you can see from the dates that this has been debated for a long time . 
  under english law , reasonable belief in consent suffices . 
  consent does not have to be explicitly stated . 
   never really fully understood the point of having such generous benefits in countries like germany or the uk - how do you then stimulate people to actually work and contribute if they can leech off for life off the system and still maintain a relatively decent standard of life ?
