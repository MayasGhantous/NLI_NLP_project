  and this is common for the upper houses in bicameral legislatures ( example : germany 's bundesrat ) . 
  they are still democratically accountable . 
  a bicameral legislature where both chambers were to be elected the same way ( direct election by the people ) would be redundant . 
  the reason behind such a bicameral system in a federal or confederated system is that not only do the citizens of the eu have democratic rights , but also the citizens of the member states as democratic subsystems of the whole . 
  this setup ensures that , for example , the people of estonia have a voice that represents estonian interests , and not the interests of whatever party their meps belong to in the european parliament . 
  the reason why the council uses ministers rather than directly elected representatives ( to the point of convening in different configurations with different national ministers for each area ) is that the legislation that passes through the council requires a fair amount of expertise in a variety of areas ( the parliament uses specialized committees that report to the parliament to deal with the same problem ) . 
  meet [ sean delonas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sean_delonas#controversies ) , until recently a cartoonist for the new york post , america 's [ answer to the sun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_york_post#criticism ) , and also owned by rupert murdoch . 
  income from interest made up some 15 % of total income at one point ; these days , the fund 's reserves are being depleted because the population is aging . 
   the social security fund in the us is not funded , it is no different to schemes elsewhere . 
  eh , what ? 
  the [ social security trust fund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_security_trust_fund ) most definitely invests its money and uses that to pay out benefits , though the entirety of social security payouts has ( so far ) been a mix of pay-as-you-go and earned interest from the fund . 
  i 'd argue that this is a bit more complicated . 
  first , you can also have state-run pension funds . 
  see the us or the netherlands . 
  state pensions need not involve direct transfers from the younger generation . 
  second , even pension funds draw on the economic activity of the younger generation . 
  this is especially true for defined benefits ( as opposed to defined contribution ) schemes ; see the current debate around the social security trust fund in the us . 
  the main benefit of pension funds is that they allow the society to claw back money from the investment market without taxation . 
  but a hugely lopsided generational imbalance also means huge pension funds , where pension funds become ever bigger parts of the economy , eventually dominating it . 
  third , pension funds have their own risks , such as financial crises or the current situation , where interests are almost universally low . 
  direct intergenerational transfers tend to be more resilient in such a situation . 
  fourth , the real issue goes a bit deeper . 
  in most western societies , scarcity of goods or services is not an issue . 
  money is therefore just an instrument for allocating those goods and services ; an aging population is thus not an existential crisis , as long as increases in productivity mean that a smaller segment of society can provide what it needs , but it can greatly affect the incentives that money creates . 
  automation creates a similar effect in that it becomes possible for ever smaller parts of society to generate the same or better standard of living for all ; the question is not whether the non-working parts of society can be supported , but how money can retain its current function in a society with a shrinking labor force . 
  it is technically an obligation , but as sweden showed , it 's pretty easy to avoid it indefinitely if you do n't like it . 
  for what it 's worth , i think making it a requirement was always a bad idea . 
  even if the euro were n't such a clustermess . 
  of course it is . 
  plenty of countries have ftas with the eu without free movement of workers . 
  it 's access to the single market that is invariably tied to free movement of workers , because free movement of workers is one of the four freedoms that define the single market . 
   if i am not mistaken , unanimity is only required in the case of a mixed agreement . 
  i am referring to to the various conditions listed in article 207 ( 4 ) . 
  ( edit : article 218 ( 8 ) sentence 2 may also come into play . ), 
  i do n't feel even remotely confident assessing them , but some legal experts at least have opined that they matter . 
  they are unrelated to the issue of eu-only vs. mixed agreements , as far as i can tell . 
  it is also worth noting that the decision to classify ceta as an eu-only agreement ( which only affects areas that the eu is competent to legislate in and thus requires ratification only by the european parliament and council of the eu ) or a mixed agreement ( which touches upon the competences of the member states and therefore also requires ratification in the member states ) is reviewable by the cjeu under [ article 218 ( 11 ) tfeu ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_the_functioning_of_the_european_union/part_five:_external_action_by_the_union#article_218 ) . 
  every member state , the commission , the council , and the european parliament can ask the court to rule on that matter . 
  in fact , this is currently happening with [ the singapore fta ] ( http://eulawradar.com/case-a-215-the-eu-singapore-free-trade-agreement-a-mixed-agreement/ ) , where the commission itself has requested an opinion from the court . 
  what might make the situation interesting is if ceta were to be classified as an eu-only agreement because it does not affect member state competences ( hypothetical , i do n't know the answer ) . 
  in that case , ratification by the member states were a voluntary act to give it additional legitimacy and might be the politically smart move , but not a required move . 
  all that said , ceta can not be ratified without at minimum the consent of the parliament and the council ( and gabriel currently threatens to withhold consent in the council if ratification does not also happen in the member states ) . 
  additionally , and while i personally do n't have the requisite expertise to really assess the issue , at least some legal experts seem to think that under [ article 207 tfeu ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_the_functioning_of_the_european_union/part_five:_external_action_by_the_union#article_207 ) , ceta ratification requires unanimity in the council . 
  in that case , every single member state has the power to stop ratification . 
   i like the scientific comparison , but its a bit muddy because if you have an expert , they can only be peer reviewed by another expert in the field ( that was a principle set out since halley and newton ) . 
  and until that happens , an uncorroborated claim remains a data point . 
  something that you may want to take into consideration , but do n't want to rely on . 
  more importantly , this really applies only to active research . 
  everybody can get a working knowledge of , say , calculus , basic macroeconomics , or how the eu functions . 
  a great many of the dodgy claims that were being advanced during the brexit debate were easily falsifiable even by non-experts , especially where they did n't rely on empirical observations , but established fact ( such as the false # 350 million a week claim ) . 
   i thought the idea put across this sub with brexit is that the comman man should listen to experts ? 
  it 's not about unquestioningly accepting every claim ; in science we do this thing called `` peer review '' for a reason ( imperfect as the process is ) . 
  questioning and analyzing a hypothesis or claim is something that you should always do . 
  what you should n't do is blindly disregarding in favor of claims made up from whole cloth , just because you resonate more with your own preferences . 
  [ this paper ] ( http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/europa/aktuell/160624-bm-am-fra_st.html ) by foreign ministers jean-marc ayrault and frank-walter steinmeier might be interesting in this context ( scroll down to `` fostering growth and completing the economic and monetary union '' ) . 
  it at least seems to have a different thrust than sch\u00e4uble 's paper . 
   but i think there will be some changes , for instance you may have to actually have work before coming to the uk . 
  what would be the point ? 
  you do n't have to pay social assistance if somebody comes to your country and is still looking for a job . 
  article 24 ( 2 ) citizens rights directive . 
   will the eu end all agreements with them or negotiate ? 
  the so-called `` guillotine clause '' will terminate all agreements automatically when one is no longer renewed or is terminated . 
  example from the agreement on freedom of movement : * `` the seven agreements referred to in paragraph 1 shall cease to apply six months after receipt of notification of non-renewal referred to in paragraph 2 or termination referred to in paragraph 3 . 
  well , the point behind article 7 is really to protect against wholesale abandonment of democratic values , fundamental rights and such , i.e. 
  if a member state were on its path to becoming north korea lite . 
  if we were to set the threshold * that * low that just delaying the recognition of a non-binding referendum could trigger it , then most member states would at some point be in violation of the article 7 criteria in some way or another . 
  keep also in mind that the referendum was always said to be non-binding ; forcing the uk to adhere to it now -- making it de-facto binding -- would mean trying to override the legislative intent of the parliament of a sovereign nation , and then the uk would have all the rights in the world to be pissed off . 
  the commission can not really do anything against the will of the european parliament and the council of the eu . 
  for most legislative acts , [ the so-called ordinary legislative procedure in article 294 tfeu is followed ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_the_functioning_of_the_european_union/chapter_2:_legal_acts_of_the_union,_adoption_procedures_and_other_provisions#article_294 ) ( graphical explanation [ here ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/external/html/legislativeprocedure/default_en.htm ) for people who do n't enjoy legalese ) . 
  as you can see , if the commission delivers a negative opinion on an amendment during the second reading , it takes unanimity on the council in order to override that , which can throw a ( temporary ) spanner in the works by forcing legislation to go to the conciliation committee . 
  but after the second reading , the commission only has an advisory role by chairing the conciliation committee , and the parliament and the council decide the final outcome among themselves . 
  in practice , the procedure is often modified ( which is what happened here ) . 
  informal `` trilogue '' negotations between commission , parliament , and council are held ( upon referral by the ep ) ; if an easy consensus can be reached , that consensus is then adopted during the second reading using the usual formal steps . 
  this speeds up legislation where there are no major disagreements between parliament and council . 
  note that this step is sometimes criticized for its lack of transparency . 
  but in the end , the commission has only so much power over the final outcome as parliament and council allow it to have . 
  once legislation gets to the third reading , the commission is out of the picture . 
   in my opinion the wording used shows that article 7 may be used if the uk government choose to try to ignore the result of the referendum or delay too much . 
  i do n't see the article 2 violation that would be required for invoking article 7 ? 
  dragging the notification out for * too * long to the point where it 's effectively ignoring the referendum result * might * be considered a serious breach of the `` values of democracy '' , but taking the time that is genuinely needed to get all your ducks in a row should not be an issue . 
  you can find the legislative history [ here ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;reference=2013/0309%28cod%29 ) . 
   what you are saying is that deliberations are already finished and its going for a vote . 
  i 'm not sure if i made myself clear , but the legislation passed last year . 
  what we 're talking about is the berec guidelines , which are n't binding , but are recommendations for the national regulators . 
  you should be able to democratically influence your national regulator through whatever options your member state has ( elections , petitions , an ombudsperson , talking to the mp for your constituency , etc. ) . 
   what a legislative initiative could have prevented was the need for such blatant cronyism in the first place - also a mep could sponsor a law to abolish it if it does not work , faster than the commission would admit it messed up . 
  but you are right - in this case it is not that relevant indeed . 
  i do n't see the cronyism , to be honest . 
  for example , zero-rating is trickier than people think . 
  completely `` blind '' network neutrality works only for unlimited plans ; metered or capped plans implicitly discriminate against high volume traffic , such as video . 
  the proposed berec guidelines recommend against the national regulators permitting the zero-rating of individual applications or services , as that would incentivize use of such services and reduce user choice , but to only allow zero-rating of entire classes of services ( such as * all * video , for example ) . 
  this is more or less a direct consequence of the regulation , as `` commercial practices '' ( this includes zero-rating ) `` shall not limit the exercise of the rights of end-users laid down in paragraph 1 . '', 
  paragraph 1 reads :  1 \\ . 
  end-users shall have the right to access and distribute information and content , use and provide applications and services , and use terminal equipment of their choice , irrespective of the end-user 's or provider 's location or the location , origin or destination of the information , content , application or service , via their internet access service . 
   this paragraph is without prejudice to union law , or national law that complies with union law , related to the lawfulness of the content , applications or services . 
  i.e. , commercial practices may not limit the user 's choice of application or service . 
  also , some of the things they ask for are already provided for in the regulation . 
  for example :  specialised services should not slow down a users ' regular internet service . 
  but article 3 ( 5 ) of the regulation already states :  providers of electronic communications to the public , including providers of internet access services , may offer or facilitate such services only if the network capacity is sufficient to provide them in addition to any internet access services provided . 
  such services shall not be usable or offered as a replacement for internet access services , and ** shall not be to the detriment of the availability or general quality of internet access services for end-users ** .
