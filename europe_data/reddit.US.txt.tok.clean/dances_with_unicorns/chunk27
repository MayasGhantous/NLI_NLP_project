  second , be careful what you wish for . 
  if the european parliament , for example , became the only chamber in a traditional unicameral system , then a tyranny of the majority would be a very real risk . 
  and that 's something that you do n't want to happen in a polity with half a billion citizens . 
  there is a reason why modern democratic systems have all these checks and balances and multiple veto points ; veto points that do * not * simply align with the majority of citizens , but protect the interests of subgroups ( such as the council those of the member states ) . 
  this is not to say that there is n't plenty of room for reform -- the current structures are historically grown , not purposely designed , and have plenty of poorly thought-out aspects [ 1 ] -- but you should be very careful with making it easier to pass eu-wide legislation . 
  that 's a genie that can be very difficult to put back in a bottle . 
  [ 1 ] the worst parts are probably the euro-related additions to the treaties that were made after the financial crisis , because they bypassed the normal checks and balances of the eu 's legislative process and used a treaty process instead ; likewise , a number of pre-lisbon framework decisions [ 2 ] were grandfathered in ( such as the eaw ) that really could use revisions . 
  [ 2 ] framework decisions [ used to be de facto non-binding ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/framework_decision#jurisdiction_of_the_european_court_of_justice ) , because there was no enforcement mechanism for them . 
  the major problem in this regard is not the risk of tariffs being introduced , but the regulatory non-tariff barriers , which hurt the service-oriented british economy much worse than the manufacturing-oriented german economy . 
  for example , volkswagen already has to manufacture cars specifically for the uk ( the whole `` driving on the left '' thing ) . 
  adhering to whatever additional regulations the british government might introduce for cars is n't going to be a big deal , as there are already separate production lines . 
  conversely , the financial services industry in the uk -- which accounts for a massive 10 % of the uk 's gdp -- pretty much depends on [ `` service passporting '' ] ( http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/pages/authorisations/passporting/default.aspx ) , with presumably [ very bad consequences for the city of london ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/opinion/brexit-will-destroy-the-city-of-london-as-we-know-it/ ) if passporting were to end . 
  moreover , [ only 7.1 % of germany 's exports go to the uk ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/deu/ ) ( the magnitude is roughly similar for other eu countries ) , while about half of the uk 's exports go to the eu . 
  this creates a hugely asymmetric negotiation position . 
  less than you think , i 'd guess ( or switzerland and sweden , both of which also run huge non-euro current account surpluses as a percentage of gdp would be screwed ) . 
  keep in mind , for example , that part of the motivation for introducing the euro was that many neighboring countries ( esp . 
  france ) already were forced to follow frankfurt 's monetary policy in practice , but without having a say in it ; for those countries , there already was a de facto currency union . 
  more importantly , germany is not only one of the world 's largest exporters , but also the world 's third-largest importer ( after the us and china ) . 
  german businesses insert themselves at critical points in the value chain and provide tools ( `` things that make things '' ) ; their exports are fairly price-insensitive as a result . 
  this is why china , of all places , is one of the major export markets for german products . 
   so let me get this straight ... european nations want to charge people ... for linking to other people 's websites ? 
  let 's be clear : the idea of ancillary copyright for the press is a bad one , but calling it a tax on hyperlinks is also ridiculous hyperbole . 
  what this is about is the following situation : a news aggregator produces a site made up exclusively or almost exclusively of snippets from various news sources , but produces no ( or almost no ) original content in the process . 
  you thus end up with close to 100 % reproduced material , but because the copied parts are small enough to individually fall under fair use/fair dealing or similar provisions of national copyright laws , the site owner does not have to pay for their use . 
  while this is economic exploitation of another 's work , exploitation at the margin always happens ( see the countless harry potter and twilight clones , for example ) . 
  one can not have legislation for every minor thing that may economically exploit a copyrighted work without creating adverse effects -- there 's always a need to strike a balance between protecting copyright owners and not stymying legitimate activities -- , and existing legislation for ancillary copyright has had plenty of them . 
  for example , the german law effectively gives power to large news aggregators such as google to force publishers to license their material for free , while smaller news aggregators lose out . 
  oops . 
  the spanish law tries to work around by making compensation compulsory , but -- as noted by the article -- had the effect of google simply pulling out of that market , probably because they found that it was no longer profitable . 
  but it is n't a link tax , either . 
  normal fair use/fair dealing provisions for quoting and referencing material still apply ; heck , they may actually * require * you to reference the source . 
   one last time . 
  you may not have noticed that you are talking to a different person now . 
  i did not participate in your original exchange . 
  here , i was simply offering a factual correction of an inaccurate claim ( namely that '' [ t ] here is no mechanism that would compel commission to care about parliament 's opinions or desires when related to amendments of legislation . 
  literally the only power ep has is veto . '' ), 
  the bigger picture of the balance of power in the overall legislative process is something that i did not discuss . 
  by the way , an additional reason why it is factually inaccurate is that the ep also has the power to sack the commission ( article 234 tfeu ) . 
  while , like other nuclear options , this is very rare -- it only happened once with the santer commission -- it is a threat that the ep can use vis-\u00e0-vis the commission , should the commission prove recalcitrant . 
  the more practical problems that you encounter is that the eu 's legislative process ( much like that of the us congress ) has so many veto points that you 'll see a lot of horse-trading going on ; but that 's the exact opposite of a claim that the ep substantively has only veto power . 
   again , it 's the legislative power that matters . 
  the only power that ep has is to vote on proposals put before it by the commission . 
  there is no mechanism that would compel commission to care about parliament 's opinions or desires when related to amendments of legislation . 
  literally the only power ep has is veto . 
  this is simply not true ; the ordinary legislative process definitely accounts for the ep proposing amendments to legislation ( article 294 ( 7 ) ( c ) tfeu ) . 
  heck , a good part of committee work in the ep revolves around churning out a veritable mass of amendments ( you can go and read committee reports on the ep 's website , check for yourself ) . 
  however , what we 're dealing with here is not ordinary legislation , but the ratification procedure for a treaty . 
  this is actually a fairly complicated area of eu law , and i think the article does not adequately address the issues involved . 
  briefly , as with internal legislation , it [ matters whether the eu has exclusive or shared competence ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv%3aai0034 ) in an area . 
  where it has exclusive competence , it can negotiate and conclude an international agreement according to the rules laid down in [ article 207 tfeu ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_the_functioning_of_the_european_union/part_five:_external_action_by_the_union#article_207 ) and [ article 218 tfeu ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_the_functioning_of_the_european_union/part_five:_external_action_by_the_union#article_218 ) without the direct involvement of the member states . 
  where it has only joint competence with the member states , the agreement has to be ratified by the member states as well . 
  the question in the case of ceta ( and ttip ) is whether we 're dealing with a so-called mixed agreement that does not fall within the exclusive competence of the eu and thus requires ratification by the member states or an eu-only agreement that can be ratified by the council of the eu and the european parliament on their own . 
  of particular interest here is article 218 ( 11 ) tfeu ( see link above ) , which specifies that any member state , the european parliament , the council of the eu , or the european commission can bring the question of whether an agreement is compatible with the treaties before the cjeu . 
  this includes the question of whether the eu has competence to ratify the agreement on its own or whether ratification by the member states is also needed ( e.g. 
  [ opinion 2/91 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a61991cv0002 ) ) . 
  note that the german government [ requested a legal opinion ] ( https://www.bmwi.de/bmwi/redaktion/pdf/c-d/ceta-gutachten-einstufung-als-gemischtes-abkommen,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi2012,sprache=de,rwb=true.pdf ) on whether ceta would be a mixed or eu-only agreement . 
  unfortunately , the text is in german and there does not seem to be a translation available ; but the author arrives at the conclusion that ceta is a mixed agreement . 
  finally , it is not unlikely that per article 207 ( 4 ) tfeu ratification of ceta may actually require unanimity in the council of the eu , not just a qualified majority . 
   or the indirect or ` semi-elected ' argument and why in the eu setting it would differ from u.s. and uk you can read it here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_deficit_in_the_european_union this does not actually seem to spell out any difference . 
  can you be more specific rather than pointing to the page ? 
   and here : http://www.eu-facts.org.uk/the-referendum-debate/leave-arguments/leave-argument-the-eu-is-undemocratic/ this seems to be carefully engineered rhetoric to make things sound different from the way they are ; for example , that `` members can not be put in place or removed by the european electorate '' ; the same is also true for the uk . 
  both in the eu and the uk , the power to remove or replace the head of the executive lies with the legislature , not the electorate . 
   example case happening now : https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/eu-parliament-rule-ukip-meps-immunity this is parliamentary immunity that the * directly * elected members of the european parliament have and for which similar provisions exist in various member states . 
  it extends only to speech , anyway . 
  more general parliamentary immunity also exists to protect meps from arbitrary prosecution , but that can and is usually lifted in the case of actual crimes . 
  it exists to safeguard the functioning of the legislature against abuses by the executive ; and again , it applies to the directly elected members of the legislature only . 
   it 's the indirect elected officials that makes the process undemocratic to many eurosceptics . 
  in addition , these ` representatives ' have total immunity while ` representing ' the people . 
  not to put too fine a point on it , but neither david cameron nor barack obama ( nor their cabinets ) are directly elected . 
  that does not make either system undemocratic . 
  especially in eu member states , direct elections are atypical except for legislatures ( and in bicameral legislatures , it 's uncommon for the upper chamber to be elected directly ) . 
  it is unclear why the same mechanisms that are used in democracies all over europe would only make the eu undemocratic . 
  i am also not sure what you mean by `` total immunity '' . 
  as i noted , the european commission , for example , can be removed by the european parliament through a motion of censure ( article 234 tfeu ) . 
  this is not a theoretical threat , either ; the santer commission was forced to [ resign this way in 1999 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/santer_commission#resignation ) . 
  members of the council of the eu and the european council can be removed through whatever means the constitutions of their member states provide to kick out their governments ( such as a motion of no confidence in the uk ) . 
  it 's a common misunderstanding . 
  in reality , everybody in the eu who is in a position of power has been either directly or indirectly elected by eu citizens . 
  the european parliament is elected directly by eu citizens . 
  the members of the council of the eu ( council of ministers ) and the european council ( collective heads of state ) are individually elected through the governments of their member states and accountable to the voters of those member states . 
  the council of the eu is the upper chamber of the legislature and exists to safeguard the interests of the individual member states and the principle of subsidiarity . 
  the european commission is elected by the european parliament and can be removed by the european parliament through a motion of censure . 
  the european council proposes a candidate for commission president ; by convention , that is the `` spitzenkandidat '' of the party that won the ep election . 
  that candidate then proposes commissioners ( one from each member state ) to the european parliament ; the parliament then conducts confirmation hearings and either confirms or rejects the commission . 
  changes to the commission can occur during hearings , such as in 2014 , when the ep rejected alenka bratusek , the proposed slovenian commissioner , over allegations that she had been nominated via backdoor dealings . 
  note that this does not mean that everything is fine ; democratic accountability ( directly or indirectly ) is a necessary , not a sufficient condition for a functioning democratic system . 
  specifically , the actual concerns that the leave campaign has tend to be over the principle of subsidiarity , not democratic accountability . 
  the [ principle of subsidiarity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subsidiarity#general_principle_of_european_union_law ) demands that actions should be taken by member states , not the eu institutions , wherever that is possible . 
  it is difficult to make an objective argument here ; even the loosest of confederations can not in practice give * every * member state complete veto power , or you 'd have constant gridlock ; this is why we have the council of the eu , which requires a supermajority for most decisions , but unanimity only for a few and the [ yellow card procedure ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_legislative_procedure#national_parliaments ) that allows a minority of member states to intervene early in the eu 's legislative process if they think that the principle of subsidiarity is endangered . 
  but whether that 's enough or too little is very much a matter of opinion . 
   did n't know that . 
  it 's the so-called [ paradox of thrift ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paradox_of_thrift ) . 
  it 's a direct consequence of the fact that in a closed economy , inputs equal outputs . 
  one person 's spending is another person 's income ; cut somebody 's spending , and somebody else 's income will go down as a consequence . 
  while national economies or the eu are not fully closed economies , treating them as closed is still a good approximation unless you run a huge trade surplus . 
  this is different from households and businesses , which are n't closed economies . 
  i 'd start with : * the pregnant workers directive . 
  * the working time directive . 
  * the parental leave directive . 
  * various consumer protection laws ( such as limiting card owner liability for card fraud ) .
