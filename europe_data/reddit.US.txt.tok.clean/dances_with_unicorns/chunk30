  lots of the hate is targeted at things that are factually wrong , so you waste time explaining why the european commission is n't unelected or that the european parliament does n't just have a veto power , but can actually amend legislation . 
  as a result , you never get to the meat of actual problems , such as whether there 's a point to having 28 commissioners or whether that leads to a bloated bureaucracy or the question of agricultural subsidies or that of lobbying-related transparency or the use of inter-institutional agreements as part of the ordinary legislative procedure , because you 're too busy debunking superficial lies and ignorance . 
  that sounds like a good argument to bring up before the cjeu . 
   the counterargument is that you are here viewing only one purpose of the deadline , i.e. 
  that it may be to exercise pressure on the leaving state to get done with it . 
  but the deadline can also be read to have a different or at least additional purpose : to have a cooling-off period and the option to extend this cooling-off period also makes sense . 
  this is very similar to how divorce proceedings work in some jurisdictions , after all . 
  i note that i am not advocating for one side or another of this argument . 
  i am just pointing out that there * is * an argument ( if you doubt me , i can point you to several legal scholars [ arguing it ] ( http://verfassungsblog.de/is-article-50-reversible-on-politics-beyond-legal-doctrine/ ) ) and that it may take the courts to settle it . 
  it 's actually something that 's being debated by legal scholars . 
  and quite seriously , too . 
  briefly , the vienna convention on the law of treaties ( aka the `` treaty of treaties '' ) states in article 68 that notifications for withdrawal are revocable :  * article 68 . 
  revocation of notifications and instruments provided for in articles 65 and 67 *  * a notification or instrument provided for in article 65 or 67 may be revoked at any time before it takes effect . 
  * a problem arises because the eu is itself not party to the vclt . 
  however , per article 3 ( 5 ) teu , the eu is bound by customary international law ( this is how the cjeu has consistently ruled ) :  * 5 \\ . 
  in its relations with the wider world , the union shall uphold and promote its values and interests and contribute to the protection of its citizens . 
  it shall contribute to peace , security , the sustainable development of the earth , solidarity and mutual respect among peoples , free and fair trade , eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights , in particular the rights of the child , as well as to * *** the strict observance and the development of international law , *** * including respect for the principles of the united nations charter . 
  * thus , a key question is whether article 68 vclt is part of customary international law and whether article 50 teu displaces article 68 vclt or works in conjunction with it . 
  and this is why it would ultimately be up to the cjeu . 
   there 's a reason our economy has powered ahead post crisis whilst greece is about to get its 15th bailout . 
  well , it depends on what you mean by `` powered ahead '' . 
  * [ decline in real wages ] ( http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2016/07/uk-real-wages-decline-10-severe-oecd-equal-greece/ ) , on par with greece . 
  it is easier to have low unemployment if your workers are willing to work for little . 
  * [ considerable less productivity than the us , germany , france , and italy . 
  ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfinalestimates/2015 ) * as the economist [ noted ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21647785-what-more-important-state-economy-or-peoples-wages-answer-might ) , the recovery was in large part driven by ( 1 ) immigration and ( 2 ) rising house prices . 
  well , this has less to do with national marriage laws and more with the problem of recognizing foreign laws , which usually requires a bit more flexibility . 
  ending an existing marriage ( as opposed to not permitting that a wedding takes place ) can have far-reaching legal consequences ( inheritance , shared ownership of property , existing children and pregnancies , a spouse 's authority to make healthcare decisions in case of incapacitating illness , etc. 
   transnational migration [ hmm . 
  ] ( https://sociology.ceu.edu/courses/transnational-migration )  *** academic program : ***  * master of arts in sociology and social anthropology *  *** course description : ***  * this course aims to assess the usefulness , limitations , and challenges of the transnational migration paradigm in the current historical conjuncture . 
  for 20 years ago , in its initial formulation , transnational paradigm for the study of migration , challanged the researchers in multiple disciplines to rethink their approaches to immigration , ethnicity , nationalism , gender , class and status , racialization , religion , globalization , and family studies . 
  since that time there has been a rapid growth of multi-disciplinary scholarship what has sometimes been called `` transnational studies '' and various agencies including the world bank and several non-governmental organizations all around the globe began to celebrate transnational migrants as heroes of development . 
  the aim of this course is to reflect on the relationship between the transnational migration paradigm and fundamental structural and cultural changes that are reconfiguring the conditions of migration , including its directionalities , actors , systems of governance , social movements , and academic frameworks of study . 
  the course will focus on the different kinds of institutions involved in this process and their change in time ; concentrate on the key concepts of transnational migration perspectives , like ethnicity , community , locality , sovereignty , and multiple membership . 
  one of the main objectives of this course is to analyse the interface between migrant formations and the state and the challenges transnational migration poses to religious and political formations , citizenship schemes , agencies of development , and to urban politics . 
  * you know , this sounds like a perfectly good anthropology course to me . 
  teaching it is a [ prof. dr. ayse caglar ] ( http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/socio-cultural-diversity/scientific-staff/prof-dr-ayse-caglar/ ) :  *** ayse caglar *** * was research group leader holding a minerva fellowship at the max planck institute for the study of religious and ethnic diversity . 
  since february 2011 she obtains a chair at the university of vienna . 
  * neither the max-planck society nor the university of vienna tend to hand out positions to just about anybody . 
   * ayse caglar is vice president of the international institute of sociology and member of the advisory board of the wissenschaftskolleg , berlin , the internationales forschungszentrum kulturwissenschaften , vienna , the interdisciplinary centre for comparative research in social science , budapest , vienna , and a panel member for the evaluation of european research council starting grants . 
  * she seems to be a very reputable scientist teaching a course in social anthropology . 
  what exactly is your problem ? 
  ( nevermind the selective picking of some courses you do n't seem to like and ignoring entire academic programs . ), 
   then get rid of the council ( or rename it ) and make it a proper senate where 1 country = x senators ( i personally think 10-12 is fine ) . 
  make them directly elected , or at least half directly elected and half appointed by each country 's government . 
  two problems with that . 
  the turnout for european elections is already pretty low . 
  i might feel more favorable if turnout were higher , but right now i think it 's a good idea that the council is de facto chosen in national elections with higher turnout ( which are also spread out over the legislative term of the european parliament ) . 
  the purpose of the council is ( inter alia ) to safeguard the principle of subsidiarity ( which is also why it uses qualified majority voting ) . 
  this requires representatives whose interest is in making sure their countries ' national interests are protected . 
  the european parliament already tends to vote along party lines and if the council started doing the same , that might not be so good for smaller countries . 
  there 'd be a definite risk of a `` tyranny of the majority '' here , which you ca n't afford in a confederation . 
   it 's usually the commission they complain about , since before lisbon , it was pretty much at the discretion of the council ( negotiated behind closed doors ) who got named `` commission president '' . 
  to be precise , this had already been de facto settled [ between 1993 and 2004 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_of_the_european_commission#parliamentary_oversight ) . 
  there are some interesting similarities here to how in great britain the house of commons slowly wrangled powers away from the monarchy . 
  they already were n't recognized . 
  here 's what changes : * marriages where one partner was under the age of 14 are and were against the ordre public ( because age of consent starts at 14 ) . 
  * forced marriages were not legal , anyway . 
  * marriages where one partner was 16 years or older were recognized , as german law allowed such marriages , too ( assuming the courts agreed ) . 
  they will remain legal unless a court decides otherwise . 
  * marriages where one partner was 14-15 years old and where the marriage was consensual were left to the discretion of the courts . 
  as i understand it , recognition of such marriages was uncommon , but happened occasionally if that was in the best interests of the minor . 
  ( there was a case in bavaria , where the couple was so in love with each other that they kept seeing each other secretly and the court decided that it was better not to break up the marriage as they could n't stop the relationship , anyway . ), 
  they will now be categorically be annulled . 
  * the law also will no longer allow minors age 16 + to get married in germany with the consent of a court ( which was a rarely used exception , anyway ) . 
  also , if this shocks you , let me [ introduce ] ( https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/13/witness-child-marriage-us ) you [ to the situation ] ( http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/child-marriage/united-states/ ) in [ america ] ( http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-child-marriage-united-states-20170211-story.html ) . 
  you can google it . 
   did get it explained that germans do not have a word/culture for `` white lie '' the closest is `` notl\u00fcge '' `` distress lie '' hence germans can be very direct . 
  try `` fromme l\u00fcge '' ( literally , `` pious lie '' ) . 
  is there an actual study that defines the terms and what metrics were used ? 
  for large countries , how are regional differences addressed ? 
  or is this just an accumulation of stereotypes ? 
  honey , to extract a concession or something else , you have to do something that the other side can not just ignore ( or , for that matter , mock outright ) . 
   why is it toothless ? 
  give it a few months and you may hear americans thinking `` 300 billion '' every time they hear `` germany '' . 
  well , even assuming that it is n't going to be roundly mocked in the american media , it 's toothless insofar as it wo n't affect german policy decisions , one way or another , and will make other countries only think that the american president behaves like a petulant child . 
  germany regularly gets worse from turkey and russia and that has n't had any effect , either . 
  playground bullying tactics that are effective against five-year olds have little power in the arena of international relations vs. other sovereign states . 
   and as far as influence , what kind of influence do you think most americans care about ? 
  it 's not so much what americans care about -- many of them do n't know enough about foreign policy to have an informed opinion -- but america 's actual foreign policy needs . 
   as an american who voted.enthusiastically for president trump , this is exactly the kind of reckoning with europe many of us want . 
  `` reckoning ? '', 
  do you genuinely fail to understand how utterly toothless this action is ? 
  the only thing it may have accomplished is that it further lowered american influence in the world . 
  the author is a [ sketch writer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_sketch_writing ) . 
  it 's humor . 
  it 's not factual reporting , it 's not even an opinion . 
  it 's not even specific to the guardian . 
  have a look at michael deacon at the telegraph doing the same thing on the other side of the political aisle . 
  it 's just expert trolling by politico . 
  you can safely assume that their page views are through the roof . 
  i 'll just say that genuine turkish beef should go well with freedom fries and liberty cabbage . 
  generally , all legislatures have the power to discipline their members for their conduct . 
  this is no different in the us , either , where article i , section 5 of the constitution says about congress that '' [ e ] ach house may determine the rules of its proceedings , punish its members for disorderly behavior , and , with the concurrence of two-thirds , expel a member . '', 
  now , in practice , expulsions for anything but criminal convictions , election fraud , or outright rebellion against the us ( during the civil war ) have been rare , and censure ( the disciplinary measure for lesser infractions ) is just a public dressing-down , but there 's no reason why the senate or house could n't also adopt other measures . 
  they ca n't , and that 's a good thing , no matter how much of a jerk he is , because it could easily be used to undermine elections .
