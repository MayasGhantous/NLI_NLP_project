  the only way that politicians get past the law ( not counting totalitarian states and such ) is by amending it . 
   also your example of the british parliament makes no sense because it clearly is a domestic case . 
  the relationship between the uk and the eu will be defined by politics , not law . 
  it shows very poor understand of politics if you believe otherwise . 
  i gave that example for the sake of familiarity . 
  legal disputes within the eu ( to which the uk would still belong at the time ) are settled before the cjeu all the time . 
   i always find it a bit strange that people would use legal arguments in politics . 
  lots of political questions are settled by the courts where there is a dispute . 
  ideally , sides will reach an agreement , but often that is not the case . 
  i mean , just look at how the dispute over whether the british parliament had to be involved in the notification was settled by the british courts . 
  political will can not override the law . 
   but what would happen if someone breached article 68 of the vclt ? 
  this is not how any of this works . 
  the vclt is not a penal code . 
  what could happen ( purely hypothetically ) is that the british government may decide to withdraw its notification , possibly citing the vclt . 
  if the eu wo n't accept that , the dispute will then be settled before the cjeu . 
  this is untested legal territory that would raise questions similar to the previous dispute ( i.e. 
  whether parliament would have to be involved in the notification ) , but with somewhat different parameters . 
  so i do n't think that anybody can be certain at this time . 
  it 's not that easy and the problem has been discussed by legal scholars before . 
  the problem here is the interaction between article 50 teu and article 68 of the vienna convention on the law of treaties ( the `` treaty of treaties '' ) . 
  article 68 vclt provides that notifications of withdrawal are revocable . 
  the eu itself is not a party to the vclt , but is bound by customary international law per article 3 ( 5 ) teu . 
  thus , an important question is if article 68 vclt is part of customary international law . 
  another question is whether article 50 teu displaces or operates in conjunction with article 68 vclt . 
  these questions would in the end be answered by the cjeu . 
  these questions do n't have 100 % obvious answers , but there is a very clear possibility that article 50 notifications may be revocable , regardless of what the council says . 
   nazi germany specifically targeted jewish people , but nobody is going out of their way to steal , withhold or invalidate syrian 's passports . 
  this does not matter , as neither eu law nor the refugee convention are specific to syrians . 
  they are general laws/treaties that apply to all refugees . 
   but even worse was the decision to let in people without documents , which is the exact opposite of what was intended . 
  both the refugee convention and eu law expressly do not require passports or other travel documents . 
  this is very much intentional , as refugees frequently do not have them for no fault of their own . 
  political , religious , and ethnic persecution often includes withholding travel documents ( for example , in 1938 germany invalidated all jewish passports ) and civil war can make it an impossibility in practice to obtain one . 
  obviously , this does not apply to illegal immigrants , but short of mind reading , there is no way to tell illegal immigrants from genuine refugees at the border . 
  each time such statistics are being discussed , this point is being brought up as something that people think is a glorious insight that nobody had ever thought of before and obviously invalidates the metric . 
  no , it 's not a joke . 
  it 's a [ well-known measure ] ( http://www.poverty.org.uk/summary/social%20exclusion.shtml ) of * relative * poverty , which is about social deprivation , as opposed to * absolutely * poverty , which is about material deprivation . 
  relative poverty is not harmless . 
  as a metric ( even if an imperfect one ) , it 's a proxy for social exclusion and economic disenfranchisement ; it is related to intergenerational social mobility ( or lack thereof ) and a host of other very real problems that society faces . 
   that is one informed taxi driver . 
  is it true though ? 
  ( humbly asking ) there have been [ allegations ] ( https://www.nzz.ch/international/spd-kanzlerkandidat-martin-schulz-streitbarer-und-streitlustiger-europaeer-ld.141633 ) that schulz prevented the creation of an special investigative committee for the luxleaks scandal . 
  this is known to be false , because such a a committee was created ( taxe ) and it [ delivered a report ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/taxe/home.html ) on not just luxleaks , but problems with corporate taxation in the eu in general . 
  another claim is that schulz [ blocked the work of taxe ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/euro-finance/news/schulz-denies-blocking-taxe-committee-s-luxleaks-investigation/ ) by preventing an extension of its mandate . 
  however , taxe 2 was [ created with a new mandate ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/tax2/home.html ) , so this does n't seem to be entirely true , either . 
  this is not to say that something fishy did n't happen , but i doubt that a taxi driver is actually all that well informed . 
  also , taxi drivers have a long and storied [ history as literary devices for journalists ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/04/all-news-fits-thomas-friedmans-expense-account/349583/ ) . 
   frankly , waiving an immunity is a judical action , it should n't be done by a political body on `` routine '' . 
  it 's only routine if it 's a genuine request . 
  immunity does not exist to protect meps from prosecution , it exists to safeguard meps from politically motivated harassment . 
  once it has been established that this is n't the case , it is n't the role of the ep to protect meps from the consequences of their actions . 
   the eu is a union , it holds it 's constituents to a certain standard and it should not invite north korea . 
  it was a hypothetical example , do n't read too much into it . 
  and it 's not safe to assume that something like this can not happen in a member state ( or article 7 teu would n't be necessary , either ) . 
   i 'm confused about why sharing pictures means a person loses their parliamentary immunity . 
  let me explain again what i posted below . 
  she does not ( and can not ) lose her immunity against charges about opinions expressed and votes cast in the performance of her duties . 
  however , being an mep does not put her above the law . 
  this is a different type of immunity , which exists to protect the ep , not her , and the ep can ( and usually will ) waive it if there are genuine allegations that an mep broke the law outside the narrow protection offered by the former type of immunity . 
  the [ `` protocol on the privileges and immunities of the european union '' ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a12012e%2fpro%2f07 ) provides for two types of immunities , under article 8 and 9 , respectively . 
  article 8 immunity protects meps against all charges relating to opinions expressed and votes cast in the performance of their duties . 
  it can not be waived . 
  article 9 immunity protects meps against any and all prosecution ** while the ep is in session ** ; the goal here is not to immunize them from prosecution , but to ensure that the functioning of the ep is not disrupted by ( say ) a member state deciding to arrest all communist meps prior to a critical vote . 
  the ep will routinely waive this kind of immunity in response to any genuine request by law enforcement , as the purpose is not to protect the mep , but the proper functioning of the ep . 
  they do not decide whether she is to be prosecuted , but only check whether the request for prosecution is genuine and in accordance with the laws of the member state making that request ; the ep is n't a court and does n't have the expertise or procedures to rule on innocence or guilt . 
   they still held a vote on whether she is to be prosecuted or not . 
  that really has no place in an elected parliament . 
  nope . 
  i think you do n't know how parliamentary immunities work .

  why did i hear that in trump 's voice ? 
  you can google for it ( `` d5 dice '' ) , but brace yourself . 
  and if you 're truly a purist , a d20 works also . 
  signed , an amber diceless fangirl . 
  d5 dice exist , you know , and it 's easy to repurpose a d10 . 
   it is classed as a disorder which is essentially mental illness . 
  nope . 
  it 's classified as a disorder because sex and gender are at odds , causing distress . 
  the goal of any treatment is to remove this distress , either by making it possible for the patient to live with it or by removing the cause of the distress ; sex reassignment therapy is an accepted treatment for gender dysphoria . 
  also , the world health organization 's icd-11 draft has it as a sexual health condition under [ `` gender incongruence '' ] ( http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd11/browse/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f411470068 ) , in part to avoid such misunderstandings . 
   it has nothing to do with bigotry . 
  your hostile , prejudiced , and frankly ignorant attitude would indicate otherwise . 
   care to explain why the suicide rate for transgenders is obscenely high ( something like 10-15 times higher than the national average ) ? 
  it almost seems like they regret doing irreparable damage to their bodies ... that [ research ] ( http://www.sebastianmitchellbarr.com/blog/2015/10/8/why-are-transgender-people-more-likely-to-attempt-suicide ) is still in its infancy , but in large part it seems to be driven by the same causes that also lead to high suicide rates among gay , lesbian , and bisexual people : the seemingly infinite capacity for hate that some people have towards people who are `` different '' . 
  bullying , discrimination , shaming , etc. 
  leads to increased suicide risk ; successful transitioning on balance reduces suicide risk . 
   treat transgenderism for what it is : a mental illness . 
  well , as it so happens , psychologists and psychiatrists disagree with you there , and thankfully , they are currently writing the rules , not bigots . 
   yet , here in the eu , to an outside observer like myself , it looks like the eu is reaching in during a national election and interfering in a similar fashion , both from attacking le pen 's wallet over the eu funds before a formal investigation and now this lifting of immunity from prosecution over violent image laws . 
  meps enjoy two kinds of immunity . 
  one that protects them from prosecution in general without the consent of the european parliament , the other protects them from prosecution for opinions expressed and votes cast in the performance of their duties . 
  the latter type can not be waived ; the former type exists not to protect the mep , but the functioning of the european parliament so that law enforcement can not randomly detain ( say ) members of a particular parliamentary group . 
  it will routinely be waived upon a genuine request by the authorities of a member state in order to investigate or prosecute the mep , as the goal is not to interfere with the normal function of law enforcement , but only to protect the ep against law enforcement trying to interfere with its normal function . 
  otherwise , meps could commit ( say ) robbery without fear of consequences .
