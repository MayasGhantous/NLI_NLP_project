  edit : also , on the allegations that le pen misappropriated funds . 
  those investigations are being conducted by [ olaf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_anti-fraud_office ) , the european anti-fraud office , established according to article 325 tfeu . 
  olaf conducts its investigations independently of the eu institutions and member state governments under the authority of its director-general , per regulation [ 883/2013 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2013:248:full:en:pdf ) . 
  article 17 ( 3 ) of the regulation :  * the director-general shall neither seek nor take instructions from any government or any institution , body , office or agency in the performance of his duties with regard to the opening and carrying-out of external and internal investigations or to the drafting of reports following such investigations . 
  if the director-general considers that a measure taken by the commission calls his independence into question , he shall immediately inform the supervisory committee , and shall decide whether to bring an action against the commission before the court of justice . 
  * the current director-general of olaf is giovanni kessler , a former italian prosecutor , who to the best of my knowledge is above reproach . 
   but are n't `` fianc\u00e9 '' and `` fianc\u00e9e '' pronounced the same ? 
  yeah , but they are n't common words , so it 's not like rote memory should take over . 
  and one refers to a man and one to a woman , so if you mix them up ... 
  homophones tend to trip up native speakers more than those for whom english is their second language . 
  i 've been told that this has to do with us learning how to pronounce them long before we 're learning how to spell them , while non-native speakers learn spelling and pronunciation at the same time . 
  i 'm not sure if there 's actual research supporting this , though . 
  that said , i do n't get why people mix up `` affect '' and `` effect '' all the time , and do n't get me started on `` fianc\u00e9 '' vs. `` fianc\u00e9e '' . 
  the ring of the nebelux ? 
  it 's a problem caused by illegal moose immigrants . 
  it 's true , i heard it on fox news . 
  rose monday floats are a political contact sport in germany . 
  it 's more about speaking truth to power than multi-layered satire . 
  nope . 
  nobody is above the law , not even intelligence agencies . 
  they may have more latitude than law enforcement in gathering intelligence , but they 're still subject to the law . 
  the problem is that the bnd apparently broke the law , according to the reporting in the german press . 
  nothing new ( it 's hardly the first incident in a long litany of bnd scandals ) , but it 's still illegal . 
   how is paying the bills that we were already commited to pay and playing by the standard set of rules hardline ? 
  well , in all fairness , there 's plenty of debate over how much the uk actually has committed to . 
  for example , some eu politicians argue that the uk should keep contributing until the end of the current [ mff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiannual_financial_framework ) period , even if they leave before it ends and even for obligations that were not agreed to before they leave . 
  the other problem is that the two year schedule is so tight that the british government obviously would prefer to have the various negotiations run concurrently . 
   okay but the way our market system is set up , companies seem to have no problem wrecking the environment . 
  that seems like a fatal flaw in the system . 
  there are counters to that . 
  we can regulate and punish such behavior . 
  in any event , abandoning the free market will not magically make people selfless angels that forget greed . 
  obviously , it 's mathematically impossible to have economic growth indefinitely . 
  at the same time , the heat death of the universe ( and assuming we do n't find a way to leave our solar system , the end of the earth ) means that we do n't have to do it indefinitely , just for a long time . 
  more seriously , there 's no evidence that ( especially if we focus on improving energy intensity ) not to keep going for quite a while as long as we do n't wreck our planet ; centuries , probably . 
  and we do n't really have an alternative working economic model that allows us to make do without growth , so we need economic growth at a minimum until we figure out such an alternative . 
   someone has to say it . 
  neoliberalism has failed , the longer we take to accept that the worse it 's going to be . 
  the problem is that neoliberalism has just become a generic swear word of the hard left with no connection to its original meaning . 
  ludwig erhard , the father of the german social market economy was considered to be a neoliberal . 
  you will continue to need a free market for economic growth ; what you ca n't rely on is trickle down effects , aka voodoo economics . 
  if you want to reduce inequality , you will need to do that through taxation and redistribution , but without a free market , you also wo n't have much to redistribute . 
  the trick is to find the right balance , not to slander one or the other as `` neoliberalism '' or `` socialism '' . 
  it sort of is ( \u00a7 1 stvo ) , but only after the fact , i.e. 
  if it contributed to an accident . 
  according to some brief research , \u00a7 23 stvo does not seem to be applicable ; while \u00a7 23 stvo requires you to operate your vehicle in a way that your sight is n't impaired by passengers , animals , freight , devices , or the state of your vehicle , articles of clothing are not part of the list . 
  well , the thing about an independent judiciary is that `` political backing '' should not be a factor in interpreting the law . 
  obviously , in practice this is sometimes not honored , but given the composition of the cjeu , british populist sensibilities are unlikely to play much of a role . 
  and that you personally do n't like it does n't change the fact that this interpretation has fairly [ broad support among experienced legal scholars and practitioners ] ( http://verfassungsblog.de/is-article-50-reversible-on-politics-beyond-legal-doctrine/ ) . 
  no , that 's what legal scholars like paul craig , professor of english law at oxford , [ say ] ( http://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/brexit-foundational-constitutional-and-interpretive-principles-ii/ ) . 
  the general legal argument does not revolve around the original intent . 
  briefly , the vienna convention on the law of treaties ( aka the `` treaty of treaties '' ) states in article 68 that notifications for withdrawal are revocable :  * article 68 . 
  revocation of notifications and instruments provided for in articles 65 and 67 *  * a notification or instrument provided for in article 65 or 67 may be revoked at any time before it takes effect . 
  * a problem arises because the eu is itself not party to the vclt . 
  however , per article 3 ( 5 ) teu , the eu is bound by customary international law ( this is how the cjeu has consistently ruled ) :  * 5 \\ . 
  in its relations with the wider world , the union shall uphold and promote its values and interests and contribute to the protection of its citizens . 
  it shall contribute to peace , security , the sustainable development of the earth , solidarity and mutual respect among peoples , free and fair trade , eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights , in particular the rights of the child , as well as to * *** the strict observance and the development of international law , *** * including respect for the principles of the united nations charter . 
  * thus , the key question among legal scholars at the moment is whether article 68 vclt is part of customary international law and/or whether article 50 teu displaces article 68 vclt ( i 'm simplifying here somewhat for the sake of keeping the explanation understandable ; there are additional pro/con arguments that become increasingly complex ) . 
  resurrections do n't come cheap . 
   only 22.4 % less free time so not exactly aligning with the pay difference . 
  careful with percentage math . 
  22.43 % less free time means working 28.9 % more . 
  moreover , if you check the [ oecd employment outlook ] ( http://www.oecd.org/els/oecd-employment-outlook-19991266.htm ) for the most recent data , you will find the following : average annual hours worked : 1790 ( us ) vs. 1371 ( germany ) , or about 30.6 % more . 
   better to be poor in germany than poor in the us no doubt . 
  but stuff is cheap in the us , along with being paid more , but yes inequality is higher so probably it 's just the rich in the us who are much richer than the rich in germany . 
  but that 's only a guess . 
  i guess you have n't tried being a parent in the us ? 
  prepare to spend half an income on childcare , for example . 
  also , if you 're poor , the housing situation in germany is better and so is urban planning in general ( lack of food deserts , better public transportation ) . 
  price levels in the [ us and germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity#oecd_comparative_price_levels ) are n't much different overall . 
   well making more money as well but yeah it 's completely one sided . 
  the `` making more money '' is based on gdp per capita , which is a rather crude proxy . 
  better to be poor in germany , better to be rich in the us ( somewhat simplified ) . 
  you 'll also work a lot more in the us . 
   the ' 9.2 times more likely to go to prison ' and ' 5.4 times more likely to be murdered ' are kind of shocking . 
  yes , but for most people it 's not actually `` 5.4 times more likely to be murdered '' , as there are vast regional differences . 
  the wide availability of guns does lead to an increased risk of altercations suddenly becoming homicide even in normally peaceful areas , though . 
   and apparently germans are healthier and live longer despite paying nearly half what americans pay for healthcare . 
  not really surprising . 
  american healthcare can be excellent ( assuming you 're not part of the uninsured or underinsured minority ) , but healthcare delivery and health insurance is horribly inefficient . 
  well , keep in mind that the oecd average in 2015 was 490 for math and the test is calibrated for a standard deviation of 100 points . 
  a fair amount of the differences are just statistical noise ( easy to see if you compare the 2012 and 2015 results , which can fluctuate a fair bit even for the same country ) . 
  thus , i would n't read too much into a difference of just a few percentage points . 
  well , yeah . 
  heidi was the cause of one of the [ most traumatic events in nfl history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heidi_game ) , after all ( though it was n't the animated version ) . 
  not uniquely hungarian , i 'm sad to say ... 
  because the eu has a complex system of checks and balances ( including a bicameral legislature , a charter of fundamental rights , and a court of justice ) that member states generally trust -- based on experience -- to do the right thing ( or at least not to screw up too badly ) . 
  this system also allows for incremental changes to how free trade works within the eu . 
  a trade agreement has little to offer in terms of checks and balances and also lacks means to easily amend parts that turn out to be broken after the fatct . 
  while in theory one can always withdraw from a trade agreement that is untenable , this means that the only realistic option to amend it is getting rid of it entirely . 
  also , free trade within the eu has always been primarily a means to an end . 
  read the [ schuman declaration ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/symbols/europe-day/schuman-declaration_en ) to understand that the ultimate goal has always been to ensure that `` any war between france and germany becomes not merely unthinkable , but materially impossible . '', 
  think of the eu as an economic version of mad , where going to war against another member state is just too painful to consider , because you 're indirectly destroying the foundations of your own economy . 
  this is nothing new and is something that has been debated for years . 
  in fact , the uk has traditionally been one of the worst offenders when it comes to scapegoating ( though hardly the only one ) . 
  i would n't really call it a `` wonderful benefit '' of brexit , as this would reverse cause and effect . 
  well , lammert 's proposal `` fixes '' the problems that the federal constitutional court had with the old system simply by amending the constitution . 
  while this may turn out to be unavoidable in the end , you do not want to rush constitutional amendments . 
  also , an electoral reform shortly before an election always raises concerns that it may be motivated in part by a desire to exert control over the composition of the legislature . 
  given that lammert 's proposal would likely benefit the bigger parties and hurt the smaller parties , this is not purely a theoretical concern .
