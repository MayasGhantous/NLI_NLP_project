  if it is n't taken out of the economy , then it ca n't be used as a `` countercyclical '' ( lol ) measure . 
  in reality , germany partakes currently in money creation . 
  kfw borrows and lends money , like any other bank , except with a public mandate . 
  it does not `` take money out of the economy '' , it [ creates money by participating in the fractional reserve banking process ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/money_creation#money_creation_by_commercial_banks ) . 
  public investment banks also traditionally [ have a countercyclical role ] ( http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_831.pdf ) . 
  this should really not be anything new . 
  it is one of the most well-known roles of public investment banks . 
  obviously , the ecb is also currently creating money as part of their qe efforts , but it should be noted that the german bundesbank has generally [ been unhappy ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/12159750/bundesbank-chief-on-collision-course-with-mario-draghi-over-qe.html ) with the qe program , in large because of worries about asset price inflation . 
  and i know how qe works , thank you , but that 's an unrelated mechanism , though with similar goals . 
   the reason that germany benefits from a common currency is simply that it becomes more economical to have european business centralised . 
  the problem with this claim is that german is largely about [ small and medium enterprises ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mittelstand ) , not large and centralized firms . 
   i never said a weak currency . 
  i said a common currency . 
  the reason why the euro as a common currency benefits germany is generally assumed to be that otherwise , germany 's currency would have appreciated , weakening its ability to export . 
  if you have an alternative economic theory that you want to advance , please explain it . 
  i had only your comment to go by , which prompted an interpretation in line with what the common reasoning of economists would be . 
   it is surprising you are unable to read two sentences . 
  also , i do n't think answering reasoned disagreement with a personal insult helps your argument . 
  while having a comparatively weak currency helps a bit , this means less these days than it once did . 
  most developed countries participate in only a few links of the value chain ; they import goods , add value , then export the improved goods . 
  for example , look at how the massive devaluation of the pound barely helped british exports ; while exports became cheaper , imports became proportionately more expensive . 
  germany never devalued the mark , not even once , and had high growth when the euro was at its strongest . 
  this is because a lot of the goods and services that german businesses exports are not particularly price-sensitive . 
  this is just how the german economy developed over the past seven decades . 
  this works also because germany developed economic structures to work around its inability to devalue its own currency [ 1 ] . 
  wage deflation during recessions is an accepted part of the german system of collective bargaining ( in lieu of currency devaluation ) ; germany has a huge public investment bank ( kfw 's current balance sheet is about half a trillion euro ) so that it is not as dependent on a central bank for money creation and can also use public investment as a countercyclical measure . 
  the problem is not so much that germany benefits from a currency that is too weak , but that several other euro countries do not have comparable mechanisms to substitute for their lack of monetary policy levers . 
  that said , traditional monetary policy has been pretty ineffective in recent years ( not just in the eurozone ) , so it 's not clear if even having those policy levers would help . 
  [ 1 ] before the euro , not really an inability , just a really , really unpopular measure . 
  germany is the quintessential example of what mariana mazzucato calls an [ entrepreneurial state ] ( http://marianamazzucato.com/the-entrepreneurial-state/ ) . 
  a country that is neither interested in socializing the economy nor being a distant laissez-faire regulator , but constantly and actively invests in itself . 
  as she [ put it ] ( http://marianamazzucato.com/2015/03/16/europe-should-do-what-germany-does-not-what-it-says-it-does/ ) :  * that is , europe should have a common investment plan so that more countries do what germany actually does ( e.g. 
  investing in r&d and vocational training , constructing a strategic public investment bank , investing in science-industry fraunhofer institutes , envisioning a green transformation of all sectors through their ` energiewende ' policy , and redistributing wealth between its regions ) ... not what it says it does ( tightening its belt ! ) . 
   on the other as u/spirit _ inc said there is little accountabilty on their work , so it 's hard to emphatize with them . 
  i 'd argue that this is largely on the press . 
  accountability is dependent on adequate reporting and reporting on what 's going on in brussels and strasbourg is often extremely poor . 
  the confirmation hearings for the european commission in 2014 make for a good example ; in several member states you could have been excused for not knowing that they were even happening , because the press pretty much did n't report on them at all ( whether out of incompetence , lack of interest , or to actively push a narrative of the ec being unelected ) . 
  otherwise , the usual mechanisms are in place that you 'd expect of democratic institutions . 
  the members of the european commission ( executive ) , the european parliament ( lower house of the legislature ) , and the council of the eu ( upper house of the legislature ) are all elected , either directly or indirectly and are thus accountable to the citizens of the eu . 
  there are the usual mechanisms that you can expect in a democracy , from judicial review of legislation to [ parliamentary questions ] ( https://epthinktank.eu/2014/12/05/parliamentary-questions/ ) . 
  but these mechanisms ca n't work properly if the public remains ignorant of them or , worse , is actively misled . 
  obviously , this does not mean that the political system of the eu could not be improved , but most people do n't even have the background to understand why ( say ) the use of inter-institutional agreements in the ordinary legislative procedure may be a problem ( most do n't even know what either iias or the ordinary legislative procedure are ) . 
  first , the problem that the uk faces is not tariffs , it 's regulatory [ non-tariff barriers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-tariff_barriers_to_trade ) . 
  these have become increasingly important in the modern world , much more so than tariffs . 
  for example , the reason why ferrero does n't export kinder surprise eggs to the us is not any sort of tariff , but because us food safety law does not allow for confectionery to contain toys . 
  one of the big achievements of the eu is that it managed to get 28 countries to agree harmonize most of these regulatory barriers . 
  this is a major reason why the eu has the precautionary principle and a bicameral legislature with lots of veto points and an independent court to oversee the application of treaty rules ; they 're means to the end of getting legislation that everybody can reasonably trust . 
  a hard brexit will put an end to unbureaucratic access to the single market ; british companies will then have to obtain separate approval for their products in the eu-27 and they will face additional complications when exporting goods and services to the continent . 
  not because the eu is nasty , but because that 's just the way international trade works . 
  obviously , this will also work the other way round , but the uk is a much smaller market for the eu-27 than the eu-27 are for the uk . 
  second , a singapore-style tax system is probably not the answer . 
  for starters , the uk is already below the eu average when it comes to tax revenues as a fraction of gdp and at the low end for western europe . 
  cutting it much further could easily jeopardize core areas of public spending , especially given the strain that the nhs is already under . 
  also , singapore has a [ trade surplus ] ( http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/singapore/trade_balance/ ) that makes germany 's look tiny . 
  the uk has a consumption-based economy . 
  rebuilding it to be an export-oriented economy would not be an easy task ; manufacturing in the uk is weak and if you want to export services , those pesky non-tariff barriers become an even bigger problem . 
   your second point sounds like you ( no offence intended , just an observation ) do n't really like to question authority . 
  it 's just that i like facts rather than your invented alternate reality . 
  what you claimed to have happened has never actually happened . 
  there was no unilateral decision by merkel or the german government to accept immigrants . 
  i was simply giving you the abbreviated version of why it was n't possible ( as a sort of reductio ad absurdum ) rather than explaining the actual events yet again . 
  for a more detailed explanation , see [ my older comment here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/5e8bh1/question_from_an_american_to_germans_how_do_you/daatjvt/ ) . 
   a week before her snap decision she told a palestinian girl to go home on german tv . 
  no , she did n't say that . 
  a complete transcript ( in german ) is [ here ] ( https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article144094607/was-merkel-und-das-maedchen-wirklich-besprochen-haben.html ) ( careful , autoplay video ) . 
  she actually avoided commenting on the girl 's case and merely explained germany 's asylum policies in fairly general terms . 
   there was a backlash and that 's why she made this decision to accept immigrants . 
  she did not make a decision to accept immigrants . 
  she would not even have had the power to unilaterally make such a decision . 
  ( germany does not have a presidential system , where the executive and the legislature are co-equal branches , but a parliamentary democracy , where every substantive matter is subject to approval by the legislature , and merkel also heads a coalition government and is dependent on the consent of the social democrats in planning and executing policy . ), 
  if you read the text of the directive , you will notice that it is not limited to cookies , but refers to any information stored on the user 's computer , whether that 's cookies or something else . 
  the directive allows you to do this without explicit consent ( regardless of the technology used ) if it is necessary for the functioning of the site . 
  shopping carts are one example . 
   but something interesting did happen there . 
  my present understanding is that they got sentenced for ` politically motivated ' arson rather than ` racially motivated ' arson in a country where a particular kind of racial motivation ( antisemitism ) triggers extra punishment . 
  not quite . 
  there is no such crime as `` politically motivated arson '' or `` racially motivated arson '' in german law . 
  nor does a `` particular kind of racial motivation ( antisemitism ) '' trigger extra punishment . 
  motive affects sentencing , and that is what this is about . 
  base motives -- of which racism is just one example -- can be aggravating factors . 
  it is nonsense . 
  the trial court did convict them of attempted arson ; nothing `` justified '' there . 
  however , it also found that the crime may have been politically rather than racially motivated . 
  proof beyond a reasonable doubt is still a thing in liberal democracies ; neither of the offenders had a history of antisemitism , and thus , while there may have been an antisemitic motive , the prosecution was unable to prove that , especially as the perps were drunk at the time of the crime , apologized afterwards , and voluntarily made material restitution . 
  there was no way for the court to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was racially rather than politically motivated . 
  note also that the appeals court was bound by the findings of fact reached by the trial court and could not change that assessment . 
  the problem is more that the eu did n't realize how much the online advertising mafia was willing to play hardball . 
  per the directive , you must have the option to refuse all cookies that are not necessary for the operation of the site ( such as shopping cart cookies ) ; for the most part , that only affects tracking cookies . 
  but virtually no commercial site implemented the refusal option ( see [ this eu page ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm ) for an explanation of how cookies should be used ; note the explicit option to refuse cookies in the example ) . 
  they did n't , because user tracking is pretty much [ mandated ] ( https://developers.google.com/ad-exchange/rtb/cookie-guide ) by the online ad exchanges . 
  and national governments also backed out of enforcing this rule ( e.g. 
  by creatively interpreting `` informed consent '' ) . 
  the text of article 5 ( 3 ) of the directive is :  * 3 . 
  member states shall ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned is provided with clear and comprehensive information in accordance with directive 95/46/ec , inter alia about the purposes of the processing , and is * *** offered the right to refuse such processing by the data controller . 
  *** * this shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out or facilitating the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network , or as strictly necessary in order to provide an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user . 
  even other fossil fuels would be less bad than lignite . 
  plus , it did n't help that germany started dumping nuclear power * before * having a replacement . 
  no matter what you think about the viability of nuclear power in the long term , giving up on nuclear power as a transitional energy source was n't exactly the smartest idea . 
  in economics , a bubble occurs when an asset is overpriced relative to its actual value . 
  increase in consumption has nothing to do with asset prices .
