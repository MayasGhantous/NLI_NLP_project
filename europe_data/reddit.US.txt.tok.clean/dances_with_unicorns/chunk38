  the brexit referendum would have failed under these criteria , as only 37.4 % of all registered voters voted for it . 
  the bigger problem is , of course , that all of the recent referenda ( brexit , the av vote , or scottish independence ) had issues with actually informing voters . 
  the campaigns were all run on the traditional partisan model with heavily biased media and a strong scorched earth component to boot . 
  this is simply not a good model for a working direct democracy . 
  if you want direct democracy , then the voting process at a minimum needs a mechanism that ensures that voters are reasonably informed about the issues involved . 
  not quite . 
  it replaces the entire ladder as a method of judicial review , from rational basis review to strict scrutiny . 
  how these methods evolved independently and how they relate is actually some fairly [ interesting territory for comparative constitutional law scholarship ] ( https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/8/2/263/699991/american-balancing-and-german-proportionality-the ) . 
  these days , it 's commonly a universal limiting principle , i.e. 
  it constrains any and all government action ( or , for the eu , union action ) and not necessarily just with respect to fundamental rights . 
  the principle of proportionality is a core limiting principle in the treaties . 
  it 's not a political term , it 's a common technique of constitutional review , which had its origins in prussia 's administrative courts in the 19th century , was adopted as a limiting principle by germany 's federal constitutional court after ww2 and from there spread to many other jurisdictions ( for example , it was used in south africa to declare the unconstitutionality of capital punishment ) . 
  it 's more commonly applied to fundamental rights issues ( per article 52 ( 1 ) of the charter of fundamental rights of the eu [ 1 ] ) , but applies to the treaties in their entirety via article 5 teu :  1 . 
  the limits of union competences are governed by the principle of conferral . 
  ** the use of union competences is governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality . 
  under the principle of conferral , the union shall act only within the limits of the competences conferred upon it by the member states in the treaties to attain the objectives set out therein . 
  competences not conferred upon the union in the treaties remain with the member states . 
  under the principle of subsidiarity , in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence , the union shall act only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed action can not be sufficiently achieved by the member states , either at central level or at regional and local level , but can rather , by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action , be better achieved at union level . 
  the institutions of the union shall apply the principle of subsidiarity as laid down in the protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality . 
  national parliaments ensure compliance with the principle of subsidiarity in accordance with the procedure set out in that protocol . 
  ** under the principle of proportionality , the content and form of union action shall not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the treaties . 
  ** the institutions of the union shall apply the principle of proportionality as laid down in the protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality . 
  note that the principle of proportionality does not just mean that the action is proportionate . 
  it 's a [ four-pronged test ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proportionality_\\ ( law \\ ) #european _ union_law ) , in essence . 
  the objective of eu action must be legitimate . 
  the means to accomplish that objective must be suitable to meet that goal . 
  no less intrusive means to accomplish the same goal are available . 
  the means are proportionate towards the end . 
  whether the principle of proportionality is applicable to the firearms directive is something that i 'm not qualified to assess , however . 
  [ 1 ] * `` any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by this charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms . 
  subject to the principle of proportionality , limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others . 
  i 'll go with a `` government of laws and not of men '' instead . 
  oops . 
  brain short-circuited , obviously . 
  fixed . 
   all the europeans up in here talking about how in reality they actually make more one way or another in some contrived fashion . 
  this is gdp per capita ( ppp-adjusted ) , not income . 
  luxembourg has high gdp because it 's a tax haven . 
  there 's no such thing as `` europe '' in this context . 
  germany and sweden have completely different economic profiles compared to romania or greece ( or even france and the uk ) . 
  even within western europe , productivity ( gdp/hours worked ) [ is all over the place ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfinalestimates/2015 ) . 
  the average american earns more than the average european from a wealthy european country , but that usually comes at the cost of [ working proportionately more ] ( https://data.oecd.org/emp/hours-worked.htm ) . 
  4-6 hours of annual paid leave , universal paid parental leave , unlimited sick days , and other periods where an employee does n't work or works part-time do n't come for free . 
  this is a tradeoff : income vs. work-life balance . 
  it 's pretty dramatic how [ hours worked per employee ] ( http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/files/2017/01/pikettybloglemonde03012017dataf1f9en_page_5-768x543.jpg ) were continuously dropping in germany and france , while they remained largely unchanged in america . 
  america is considerably more [ unequal ] ( https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inequality-of-incomes-before-and-after-taxes-and-transfers.png ) than the wealthy european countries and also has [ low social mobility ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_mobility#/media/file:intergenerational_mobility_graph-1.jpg ) , i.e. 
  both high inequality of income and inequality of opportunity . 
  if you look at [ actual income distribution curves ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/08/15/this-chart-might-make-you-feel-better-about-american-inequality/ ) , the bottom quintile of american incomes look more like italy than germany or denmark . 
  if you look at discretionary income ( i.e. 
  income after taxes and bills ) , about [ half of america lives paycheck to paycheck ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/half-of-americans-are-desperately-living-paycheck-to-paycheck-2017-04-04 ) . 
  high income does not necessarily translate to high liquidity or savings , especially as many american households have some form of debt to pay off at any given time . 
  trump was elected in large part by americans who did have a middle-class income , but did n't think they were economically in control of their lives . 
  this does not mean that europeans are necessarily better off ( even for the richer european countries , it 's more of an income/work-life balance tradeoff , as i wrote above ) , but the richter european countries do tend to offer better economic stability and more equality of opportunity . 
  because then there 's no incentive for a murderer to reconsider , for starters . 
  once you 're guilty of an attempt , it 'd be in your best interest to follow through , just to make sure you silence the victim , even if you suddenly regret it or if there 's an unexpected snag in your plans ( most murderers are amateurs , not habitual criminals ) . 
  generally , penalizing a nonlethal crime with a life sentence or capital punishment eliminates or reduces the incentive for offenders to leave their victims alive : they risk the same penalty either way and killing the victim eliminates a crucial witness . 
  racism generally includes discrimination on the basis of ethnicity , especially as a the term `` race '' as applied to humans is not a scientific term and has historically been [ applied to nationalities ] ( http://www.bartleby.com/182/301.html ) , too . 
  in british law in particular , a `` racial group '' can [ mean ] ( http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/rrpbcrbook.html#a04 ) `` any group of people who are defined by reference to their race , colour , nationality ( including citizenship ) or ethnic or national origin . '', 
  article 258 tfeu and article 7 teu are completely independent . 
  article 7 proceedings can be initiated regardless of any prior action under article 258 and this is what 's happening right now ( a cjeu judgement following an article 258 complaint would take months , if not years ) . 
  these are infringement proceedings under article 258 tfeu and happen all the time ( such as when a member state does not implement a directive in a timely fashion ) . 
  in the end , each member state is sovereign and the worst the court can do is order financial sanctions , which are too limited to deter a truly unwilling member state ( i think they cap out at under $ 100 million annually for poland ) . 
  hence , what is being talked about here is to invoke article 7 teu for the first time . 
  article 7 is far more far-reaching in that under it a member state could in principle be stripped of any and all rights of eu membership , including voting rights . 
  it is a far graver sanction , because it is meant to be used against member states that undermine the core principles of the eu laid out in article 2 teu , and hence also far more difficult to get underway : to enact article 7 , unanimity between the member states is necessary , and the decisions under article 7 are furthermore subject to judicial review by the cjeu . 
  this makes it unlikely that article 7 action will go beyond the warning stage , as it takes only one other member state to veto that , and hungary is extremely likely to do that ( because hungary itself is worried that it may become the subject of article 7 proceedings , too ) . 
  this is only the part about that one law . 
  the commission 's overall concerns [ are far more extensive ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=46116 ) and include concerns about the preexisting changes to the constitutional tribunal , inter alia . 
  well , this is a bill that 's being pushed by congress , not the trump administration . 
  from the eu 's perspective , the question is not whether projects such as nord stream 2 are a problem ( nord stream 2 has plenty of eu critics ) , but about the perceived american meddling in local politics . 
  it 's about the same as if the eu tried to force america 's hand on keystone xl . 
  in short , it 's not about the bill being good or bad . 
  that it may be in the eu 's best interest does n't change the question of whether america should be able to make that decision on behalf of europe . 
  america throwing its economic power around to get its policies implemented by other countries is nothing new and many countries do not exactly have happy memories of that . 
   that 's not what i read for the tpp for example . 
  there were issues with what you mentioned but the first issue always was jobs . 
  that was n't about domestic jobs , but labor standards and labor rights abroad ( i.e. 
  part of the regulatory non-tariff barriers that i mentioned ) . 
   i do n't have all the data , so i ca n't really give you a pages long reindustrialization plan , this is more of a general idea for an approach : 1 . 
  that 's not what i was asking . 
  my point was about * existing * policies , ones that you obviously regard as failures with regard to managing globalization , and i wanted to know what specific examples you can give me of those . 
  if you genuinely believe that governments are not competent or motivated enough to implement fairly simple redistributive policies to offset inequality caused by globalization , what makes you think they can or are willing to pull off something like what you propose , which is far more complex and whose effects are far more difficult to predict ? 
  it is not even clear that this proposal would work out in practice . 
   the us had talks for trade agreements with asia and europe while domestically they had n't reformed enough . 
  and the issues that people had with the proposed trade agreements were things such as mismatched health and safety regulations , not about the issue of trade as such . 
  america in particular has historically been quite content to conduct most of its trade under wto rules , because wto tariffs are already very low and negotiating dozens of treaties is difficult . 
   domestic policies have to be changed the right way and have to include economic downturns to lift up the general population before tumbling into another adventure . 
  this honestly does n't make sense to me . 
  can you give a specific example to illustrate what you 're talking about and how , in your opinion , there has been a poorer recovery from downturns as a result ? 
  i 'm not sure what `` easing up on it '' means . 
  do you realize that most trade is already tariff-free or only has negligible tariffs ? 
  the [ weighted mean applied tariff rate ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/tm.tax.mrch.wm.ar.zs?view=map ) is currently 1.57 % in the eu and 1.64 % in the us . 
  most modern free trade agreements are about harmonizing regulations so that regulatory non-tariff barriers can be reduced . 
  and the `` suffering '' part is , to be blunt , bollocks . 
  if there 's suffering , it 's generally because politicians screwed up domestic policies for one reason or another , usually independently of the domestic policy . 
  or because of economic downturns that would have hit you one way or the other . 
  and what alternative approach do you think would have avoided that problem ? 
  then that 's a problem with those governments ( or their voters for letting them get away with it ) . 
  there 's nothing that makes it inherently impossible . 
  who is `` they '' ?
