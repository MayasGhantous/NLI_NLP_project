   the poland governement knows that even if it turns into an authoritarian country , the eu will never kicked them out because the eu has no balls at all . 
  the eu wo n't kick them out because the eu simply * can not * . 
  there is no way to remove a country against its will from the eu . 
  article 7 proceedings are the closest thing , but -- as a safeguard against abuse -- require unanimity ( other than the sanctioned member state ) . 
  that , too , is impossible because hungary wo n't agree . 
   but i actually symphatize with popper !, 
  if you 've read the open society you know the part about the paradox of freedom . 
  popper himself identified that intolerance must not be tolerated . 
  in germany we have this principle enshrined in our constitution too , we call it militant democracy . 
  liberal society must be defended proactively , if necessary by force . 
  popper did not dispute this . 
  then you seem to be misunderstanding popper . 
  his key argument is that `` who should rule '' is the wrong question to ask . 
  rather , it should be : `` how can we so organize political institutions that bad or incompetent rulers can be prevented from doing too much damage ? '', 
  and he sees a representative democracy as a key ingredient to the solution , as it provides a nonviolent and institutionalized approach to get rid of bad rulers ( note how direct democracy does * not * do this ; when the people as the sovereign start to exercise power themselves , nobody can overrule them ) . 
  note also that i was citing popper because he 's a very accessible writer , not because he 's the definite authority on the subject . 
   this issue is n't just trump , and it wo n't be gone when he leaves . 
  this is a cultural divide between two very politicized groups in the country , roughly split along urban and rural lines . 
  how long will the american system absorb this culture war ? 
  in the long term , there is no guaranteed solution to this , but an authoritarian system would be even worse . 
  let 's just say that as a card-carrying member of amnesty international i do not share that optimistic evaluation of singapore . 
   given current developments i find it very hard to argue that somehow the threat to liberalism is an overreaching government and that hobbes vision is inaccurate . 
  well , i very much know that i 'd rather not have trump presiding over an authoritarian government instead of being limited by the checks and balances of the american constitution . 
  you have so far not explained how you are planning to ensure that a good guy is always in charge and never a bad guy ( plato 's fallacy with regard to philosopher kings ) . 
  and you apparently need to read up on popper at the very least . 
  i recommend both the `` open society and its enemies '' and the chapter on `` public opinion and liberal principles '' in `` conjectures and refutations '' . 
   we are seeing decaying institutions all over the west . 
  when elections happen more participation almost always means more extremism . 
  and we 've seen that before and recovered from it . 
  your claim seems to be ( 1 ) that this trend is irreversible in a liberal democracy and ( 2 ) that an authoritarian government ( hungary , poland , anyone ? ), 
  could be guaranteed to reverse this trend . 
  this does not seem to follow . 
  well , * she * has both american and german citizenship , and at least she has read more than just hobbes . 
  if you skip locke and montesquieu , not to mention more recent philosophers , you do n't get to define what liberalism is . 
   and that is not true . 
  hobbes for very good reasons is considered to be a liberal philosopher , despite being very authoritarian . 
  you 're confusing liberalism with active direct democratic participation . 
  which is a different beast . 
  no , i just recognize that hobbes is at best a borderline case when it comes to defining liberalism ; he was one of the earliest philosophers to explore the matter and his ideas were n't very evolved ; the idea that liberties could be secured by something other than a strong ruler had n't really crossed his mind . 
  when your entire argument consists of `` but hobbes said '' , then it 's not a very strong argument . 
  the problem with both authoritarian states and weak democracies is generally that they lack checks and balances . 
  a strong authoritarian government provides no guarantee that it will remain benevolent , as there 's nothing preventing it from turning evil . 
  i am not confusing liberalism with active direct democratic participation ; i have no idea where you get that idea from , as i have n't mentioned direct democracy at all and tend to be pretty critical of it . 
  liberalism is built ( inter alia ) upon the idea that checks and balances should make it hard to curtail liberties , rather than trusting the benevolence of any given person or organization . 
  my point is that `` authoritarian '' and `` liberal '' are polar opposites . 
  and `` authority '' does not imply `` authoritarian '' . 
  to quote wikipedia :  * authoritarianism is a form of government characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms . 
  individual freedoms are subordinate to the state and there is no constitutional accountability under an authoritarian regime . 
   they 've always been authoritarian as hell , but to uphold liberal values i think my oxymoron detector just went off ... 
  oddly enough , american hegemony did n't exactly work out in latin america and did n't prevent the enmity between greece and turkey , both nato members , but only greece becoming an eu member . 
  granted , the american habit of supporting or installing dictators in latin america did n't exactly help matters there , but europe had its share of dictatorships , too and somehow managed to integrate them peacefully into the eu when they became democracies and encourage their development as democracies , rather than quickly turning them back into dictatorships ( operation pbsuccess , the 1973 chilean coup d'etat ) . 
  american foreign policy during the cold war was a heavy-handed clustermess , with pretty much the sole exceptions being the eu ( or rather , what would become the eu later ) and japan . 
  hence , it should n't surprise anybody if people look for explanations why things worked out differently in these regions , given the apparent lack of aptitude american administrations had in exercising a stabilizing influence . 
  are you saying that you are willing to basically let an `` islamic radical '' criminal go free , regardless of the severity of the crime that he or she committed ? 
  do you understand that you would basically give them carte blanche to commit murder ? 
   european countries have an agreement where people that have been sentenced for crimes that involve them being imprisoned serve in their home countries . 
  thats to make it not appealing to commit crimes in countries with more lenient prisons . 
  this is the [ convention on the transfer of sentenced persons ] ( http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/0900001680079529 ) , and you completely misunderstand it . 
  first , it requires the consent of the sentenced person . 
  second , its intent is not what you claim it to be :  * the convention is primarily intended to facilitate the social rehabilitation of prisoners by giving foreigners convicted of a criminal offence the possibility of serving their sentences in their own countries . 
  it is also rooted in humanitarian considerations , since difficulties in communication by reason of language barriers and the absence of contact with relatives may have detrimental effects on a person imprisoned in a foreign country . 
  i am honestly not sure why people are so worried about tax payer expenses . 
  prisons mostly have fixed costs and the variable costs are not even a rounding error in the public budget . 
  more importantly , the impartial administration of criminal justice can not be measured in euros . 
  why should being a foreigner allow you to ( potentially ) escape years of prison ? 
   immigrants , asylum seekers , and others who are present at the pleasure of the host state can be deported for any reason-there is no inherent right for any to be present . 
  this is simply not true . 
  there 's no such thing as being `` present at the pleasure of the host state '' , especially for asylum seekers . 
  the right to asylum is enshrined in both the german constitution and various and sundry treaties that germany has ratified , including eu law . 
  asylum seekers can be deported , obviously , but only after a proper judicial process and only in accordance with the german constitution , eu law , and international law . 
  it does not hold for immigrants , either . 
  expulsion requires a basis in law , and the german constitution gives everybody the right to challenge any and all administrative decisions in the court system . 
  in german law , this whole attitude runs counter to the `` willk\u00fcrverbot '' , or `` prohibition of arbitrary decision-making '' . 
  the executive and courts are bound by the laws , and the legislature is bound by the constitution . 
  this is not about germany deciding `` to feel good about themselves '' , but touches upon core of the [ `` rechtsstaat '' principle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rechtsstaat ) and what sets a liberal democracy apart from an authoritarian state . 
  because it 's an overstatement . 
  american soldiers did n't do it single-handedly , but in an alliance with britain , the soviet union , and several other countries . 
  the blood toll of ww2 was mostly [ born by the people of the soviet union ] ( http://www.fallen.io/ww2/ ) . 
   the people who beat this couple up need to be deported immediately . 
  you seem to be unfamiliar with criminal justice systems in liberal democracies in general and germany in particular , so let me give you a quick primer . 
  you are presumed to be innocent of a crime until convicted in a court of law . 
  that holds even when guilt seems obvious ( because there have been too many cases where things turned out to be not so simple ) . 
  the criminal justice system loses nothing by carefully evaluating the evidence before convicting them . 
  this is reflected in the proverb that `` the wheels of justice turn slowly , but grind exceedingly fine . '', 
  note that there may be varying degrees of involvement and culpability , too ; for example , the ( presumably german ) security guards also seem to have been involved in bullying them . 
  in the case in question , it may not be easy to determine individual culpability quickly , as those who are involved , even only tangentially , may invoke their right to remain silent . 
  in germany , law enforcement has a duty to investigate and prosecute every criminal offense ; with very limited exceptions , there is no prosecutorial discretion . 
  there will be an investigation , and if a conviction is likely , an indictment will happen and the matter will go to court . 
  if the prosecution chooses to drop the case , the victims can appeal that decision to the courts and force prosecution . 
  an immediate deportation would possibly deprive the victims of their right to see the perpetrators prosecuted . 
  if convicted to a prison term , it is unlikely that the perpetrators will be deported immediately , because that means that they 'd escape their punishment . 
  deportation would happen after release from prison . 
  as , for example , in the [ case of the death tugce albayrak ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-court-rules-on-deportation-for-tugce-albayraks-attacker/a-37937330 ) . 
  also , obviously , any german nationals involved in the attack could not be deported . 
  i think it 's entirely fair . 
  you may have forgotten about the political movement in the 80s and 90s [ 1 ] to keep asylum seekers out of germany , which culminated in a constitutional amendment in 1993 designed to do just that ( it was pointed out back then already that germany is entirely surrounded by safe third countries ) , as well as the ugly events of rostock-lichtenhagen , m\u00f6lln , and solingen . 
  i have n't forgotten that . 
  [ 1 ] [ google 's ngram viewer for `` ausl\u00e4nder raus '' ] ( https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=ausl%c3%a4nder+raus&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1945&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=20&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3b%2causl%c3%a4nder%20raus%3b%2cc0%3b%2cs0%3b%3bausl%c3%a4nder%20raus%3b%2cc0%3b%3bausl%c3%84nder%20raus%3b%2cc0%3b%3bausl%c3%a4nder%20raus%3b%2cc0 ) is also interesting in this context . 
  does n't matter , because eu law applies instead , and eu law ( namely the qualification directive and the dublin regulation ) does n't allow for quotas , either . 
  here 's how it works , per article 3 of the dublin regulation : 1 .
