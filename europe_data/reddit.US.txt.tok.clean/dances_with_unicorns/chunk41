  an asylum seeker shows up at the german border and requests asylum . 
  germany now has an obligation to find out which member state is responsible for processing the request . 
  in virtually all cases , that 's the member state where the asylum seeker entered the eu , usually greece or italy . 
  ( there are cases , such as family reunification , where other member states have responsibility , but they are few and far between . ), 
  if `` there are substantial grounds for believing that there are systemic flaws in the asylum procedure and in the reception conditions for applicants in that member state '' , then a deportation to that member state becomes impossible and the responsibility falls upon germany to process the asylum request . 
  this is usually the case for asylum seekers entering via greece or italy . 
  it is important to understand that germany has nobody but itself to blame for this situation . 
  when dublin was originally enacted , the goal was to shift responsibility for dealing with asylum seekers to the eu periphery so that the eu core would n't be bothered . 
  well , greece and italy have run out of capacity now , and that 's the whole reason why the system has broken down . 
  had germany back then pushed for a system where asylum seekers would be distributed more fairly , it would n't be stuck with the current situation . 
   not a fallacy , but a fair asumption of / u/sultry _ somnambulist 's opinion , considering his response and total disregard for any danger of high debt ( `` there is no unhealthy level of debt '' ) . 
  that is also true , but this is also where things get more complicated . 
  there really is per se no unhealthy level of debt unless we get to really implausibly high levels ( obviously , once debt service exceeds national income , you have a problem , but no country has ever had debt even remotely that high ) . 
  britain had a 250 % debt/gdp ratio following the napoleonic wars and 240 % debt/gdp ratio following ww2 and recovered from that , for example . 
  japan has a debt/gdp ratio of over 200 % and while it could do better , the economy is not imploding ( in part because the debt is mostly internal ) . 
   hmm , i wonder what got them to this situation . 
  i wonder why they are forced to enact austerity policies and do n't just borrow more money on the market without creditors dictating conditions . 
  any idea ? 
  well , not an `` unhealthy level of debt '' per se . 
  for the years prior to the financial crisis , greece 's debt/gdp ratio was around 100 % and that was fairly constant . 
  that 's higher than average , but not higher than that of the united states for the past few years . 
  i do n't think you mean to imply that america is about to crash like greece ? 
  greece 's problems were structural in nature . 
  the fallacy here is that you assume that this would result in an increase in debt/gdp ratio . 
  the goal is to increase gdp through investing in the economy ; as long as gdp growth exceeds borrowing , you come out on top . 
  people seem to have this naive idea that the only purpose of borrowing money can be a [ helicopter drop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helicopter_money ) . 
  but when you invest the money ( e.g. 
  in the infrastructure and education ) , the result is an improving economy . 
  and not to put too fine a point on it , but german government bonds currently have * negative * real yields . 
  in other words , people are willing to pay for germany to take their money . 
  the problem that greece has is that it 's suffering from growth retardation as the result of austerity policies and therefore can not grow its way out of the debt trap it is in . 
   while that is technically true you should not underestimate how much healthcare costs in the us compared to here . 
  the healthcare costs are honestly a bit of a red herring . 
  granted , the problem affects way too many people , but if you get health insurance through your employer or belong to the upper income brackets , it 's just not a big deal . 
  a bigger problem is that high earners are high earners in part because low earners are comparatively worse off . 
  inequality before taxes and transfers is about the same , but it 's massively lower in germany or france or the nordics * after * taxes and transfers ( [ source ] ( https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inequality-of-incomes-before-and-after-taxes-and-transfers.png ) ) . 
  and while germany could improve on its social mobility , it 's still [ significantly better ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_mobility ) than what america offers : in america , the best way to become rich is to be born at least wealthy , and if you 're born poor , there 's a much higher chance that you will remain poor . 
  lots of americans ( `` temporarily embarrassed millionaires '' ) seriously deceive themselves about income as a measure of meritocracy . 
  there are two components to why you can have significantly higher income in america than in germany or france ( obviously , america massively outperforms the poorer european countries , so let 's focus on the richer ones ) . 
  one comes down to work-life balance . 
  average income per hour worked is about the same in both the us and germany , give or take . 
  you work 30 % more in america , but you also earn 30 % more . 
  4-6 weeks of paid annual leave , paid parental leave lasting a year , unlimited sick days , and so forth do n't pay for themselves . 
  tanstaafl and all that . 
  if you 're middle class , that 's the tradeoff you make ( plus , of course , differences in lifestyle ) . 
  this is a decision that everybody has to make for themselves , and there 's no right answer as to what is `` better '' . 
  different people want different things out of their lives . 
  it should be a good life , either way . 
  also , the higher taxes in germany are not really a difference maker for middle class families . 
  you pay into the pot , but you also get very tangible benefits : comprehensive health insurance , pensions , unemployment insurance , long term care insurance , paid parental leave , heavily subsidized childcare and education , and so forth . 
  even where you pay a bit more than you get out of it ( amortized over the course of your life ) , it has the effect of making your expenses less volatile and your economic situation more stable . 
  it 's a wash , basically . 
  then , for the top 20 % or so , your main additional benefit is that america is simply less redistributive and you benefit from having to give less money to the rest of society . 
  from a purely economic perspective , that is better if you 're part of that crowd ; but from a social ethics perspective , you do have to ask yourself whether you 're willing to take the [ omelas deal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_ones_who_walk_away_from_omelas ) . 
  if you are , you will almost certainly be better off in america . 
  also , the ideal person to emigrate to america is young , healthy , college-educated without children . 
  lots of the social transfers you benefit from in germany occur while you 're a child or in education , often taken for granted ( starting with paid leave for your parents and ending with tuition-free college ) . 
  if you are a single adult , you then become a net contributor to german society ; if you 're a parent , then germany looks much more favorable again ( at least these days ) , unless you 've struck it rich in the meantime . 
  spending half a parent 's income on childcare ( per child ) is no fun , not to mention some of the absurd views on parenting that american society has started to develop during the past years . 
  my husband and i could earn a whole lot more in america ( both of us have doctorates in computer science , you do the math ) , but we are also parents of two young girls , and since we are already earning more than we can reasonably spend , it makes sense for us to trade the extra income for work-life balance . 
  there are diminishing returns on income , and the hours in your life are finite . 
  mind you , if the situation were right , i 'd move back to america in a heartbeat ( it 's home , after all ) , but that would be more about non-monetary benefits such as emotional ties and the ability to be closer to my parents ( though the opposite would be true for my english husband ) . 
  the wikipedia pages mixes up two databases with different methodologies . 
  or there are transcription errors , because the data does n't match up with the 2013 numbers of the conference board total economy database ( one of the sources used ) , which has 68 for the us , 66 for france , and 65 for germany ( and 90/91 for norway and luxembourg , respectively ) . 
  see british ons data [ here ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfinalestimates/2015 ) and a historical analysis by thomas piketty [ here ] ( http://piketty.blog.lemonde.fr/2017/01/09/of-productivity-in-france-and-in-germany/ ) . 
  if you look at the development of average real wages , they stagnated in both america and germany during that period . 
  there really was n't much of a difference . 
  and it was also more of a consequence of reunification and the fall of the iron curtain . 
  it 's not like unions purposely wanted their members to not earn more . 
  the fact that every other american family [ lives paycheck to paycheck ] ( http://www.marketwatch.com/story/half-of-americans-are-desperately-living-paycheck-to-paycheck-2017-04-04 ) should serve as a valuable reality check that things are n't maybe just as straightforward as you think . 
  no , ppp adjustments and accounting for disposable income is n't enough ( disposable income , for starters , does n't account for bills ; you need discretionary income for that ) . 
  on top of that , income and expenses in america are more volatile ; there are more ways to suddenly become unemployed or to incur huge unexpected expenses . 
  obviously , america is still a pretty nice place to live and americans are pretty well off compared to most of the rest of the world , but the devil really is in the details . 
  think of the danish family in copenhagen who does n't even own a car because they do n't need one and who may have a hard time comprehending the very idea of student debt . 
  think of the fact that working more often also means spending more because you have less time to do things on your own or at your own pace . 
  another thing to consider : the average american earns 30 % more than the average german , but also works 30 % more . 
  and it 's not because of underemployment . 
  underemployment is low in germany , [ 3.5 % of the labor force ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/underemployment_and_potential_additional_labour_force_statistics ) . 
  in other words , germans have apparently simply opted for better work-life balance at the expense of income . 
   french is the language of love . 
  german is the language of command . 
  hmm . 
  i report , you decide ? 
  [ french . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aculsvlxac&amp;t=2m13s ) [ german . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsqqbjposbw ), 
   there are very few countries that have these rates atm . 
  my point exactly . 
  we 've been dealing with deflationary pressure due to a misguided procyclical policy , so that should n't be surprising . 
   comparing merkel 's stance in brexit to schr\u00f6der 's refusal to partake in the iraq war is nonsensical , because - once more - there is no german negotiation stance - only an european . 
  i did n't do a comparison , i drew an analogy . 
  analogies are rarely perfect . 
  and i expressly noted that the current situation is n't remotely like the iraq war . 
  of course there is a german negotiation stance . 
  that the eu as a whole has a negotiation stance does not preclude germany from having its own and trying to steer negotiations in directions it would prefer . 
  the eu-27 are n't a hivemind . 
   angela merkel will not be able to transform whatever happens at these tables into a substantial voter gain like schr\u00f6der could with the war . 
  which i explicitly stated myself in the second paragraph i wrote . 
  let me explain then . 
  you were trying to parse my comment overly literally by focusing on a single phrase and giving it a nonsensical interpretation .
