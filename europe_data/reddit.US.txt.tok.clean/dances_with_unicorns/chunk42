  i did the online equivalent of raising an eyebrow , at which point you tried to engage in a verbal sparring match to distract from the issue . 
  i then demonstrated that two could play that game . 
  has this helped your understanding ? 
  i did n't say `` 3 % '' and i did n't say `` consistently '' . 
  i said `` 2 % -3 % '' , which is a perfectly normal growth target for a developed country during economic expansion . 
  so , you agree with what i am saying and admit that you were just trying how far you could push hairsplitting as an extreme sport ? 
  totally . 
  what the german government thinks has zero influence on negotiations . 
  riiiight . 
  umm , you 're showing a chart that 's limited to the years when germany was the `` sick man of europe '' . 
   between 1-2 % is ideal , we do not want our economy to overheat . 
  typically , economists favor a growth rate in the 2 % -3 % range . 
  that 's a single quarter after less than 2 % growth for the past couple of years , not to mention the rest of the eurozone and the fact that it 's largely driven by foreign demand , while domestic aggregate demand remains weak . 
  well , there is this small matter of the current brexit negotiations and that popular german attitude towards leading british politicians might affect the german negotiation stance , especially in an election year . 
  remember how schr\u00f6der managed to benefit from bush 's unpopularity and publicly opposing him during the run-up to the iraq war ? 
  while something of this magnitude is unlikely to happen again -- after all , what may has done is not even close to starting an actual war , embracing torture , and all the other things that made bush unpopular -- it 's not like it 's going to help , either . 
  growth is weak and inflation is low , so the countercyclical response would be to increase spending , especially as germany has basically been following more of a procyclical policy for the past few years . 
  i have honestly no idea what you are trying to say ? 
   so a couple of the more gaping holes in what you have assumed from that quote are 1 , the uk does n't negotiate trade agreements , the eu does on our behalf and 2 , they very rarely cover services . 
  i would really appreciate it if you stopped putting words in my mouth , though i 'm not holding my breath . 
  you keep suggesting that i say or assume things that i 've never said and i see no point in continuing to argue with what appears to be a dishonest debater . 
   and somehow you translated that to 188 billion of service exports to non - eu countries . 
  umm , no ? 
  i did n't mention any numbers and nowhere did i say that * all * service exports to non-eu countries are predicated on this . 
  an obvious counter-example would be tourism-related services . 
  nobody is saying that the british economy would collapse . 
  the point is that it 's a net negative , not a net positive . 
   he is n't even talking about services . 
  correct , he 's talking about * all * exports . 
  that includes services , obviously , since the british economy is extremely service-centric . 
   source ? 
  this is what , your third response to my comment ? 
  are you going to delete this one , too , before i can answer ? 
  in any event , i thought this was well-known . 
  see , e.g. , michael dougan 's [ well-known talk ] ( https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2016/06/22/transcript-professor-michael-dougan-eu-referendum/ ) , where he explains it in everyday terms :  * first of all , the uk 's trade policy so far has been very very clever in a very sort of entertaining way . 
  we actually have not that much to offer in terms of trade relations because we are a very open economy already . 
  we basically buy goods and services with whoever we please because we are a very open economy . 
  *  * what the uk does as a trade strategy is we bargain away access to other people 's markets , the italians , the spanish , the portuguese , the romanians , so as to win trade agreements with the rest of the world . 
  *  * that is the uk 's basic trade strategy . 
  we bargain away the rest of the single market to get access to other people 's markets . 
  if we are not part of the single market anymore we actually do n't have an enormous amount of bargain power . 
  that 's the point . 
  the uk sells services ** to ** other countries by offering access to the eu . 
  also , it 's not about the ratio . 
  it 's that the service industry and its access to the eu is of strategic importance to the uk economy . 
  the financial services industry , for example , is not just an important factor by itself , but also supports an ancillary part of the domestic economy around the financial centers in london and edinburgh . 
  the high-performing parts of the service industry are also generally high-productivity sectors , which the uk needs due to [ its already low productivity ] ( https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfirstestimates/2015-09-18 ) . 
  here 's the problem with this argument : the uk 's exports are disproportionately made up of [ service exports ] ( https://data.oecd.org/trade/trade-in-services.htm ) ; in fact , it 's the second largest exporter of services in the world after the us . 
  and the reason why this number is so large is in good part that the uk serves as a low-regulation gateway to the eu . 
  obviously , the ability to fill this role would be significantly impeded following a brexit . 
  no other major european country has exports that are so skewed towards services instead of goods . 
  that 's in large part because of the erosion of the british manufacturing base , of course . 
  drug offenders make up only a [ minority of prisoners ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/02/08/what-we-get-wrong-about-mass-imprisonment-in-america/ ) . 
   are the majority still revengeful when it comes to prisoners , or is their indication of a more humane attitude ? 
  honestly , it 's not like american popular opinion is that much different . 
  what 's different is that american voters have the power to exert much more influence , both on politicians and ( ! ), 
  [ judges ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pol7l-uk3i8 ) . 
  in germany ( for example ) , the constitutional court would just say , `` nope '' , and cite article 1 of the german constitution and that would be that . 
   what events of 1960s do you suggest had an effect that would only manifest in 1980s ? 
  i do n't see how the `` crime wave of 1960s '' can explain it . 
  umm , i am talking about the surge in crime that started in the [ 1960s ] ( http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm ) ? 
  this is a fairly well-known phenomenon ; just google `` crime wave 1960s '' . 
   what events of 1960s do you suggest had an effect that would only manifest in 1980s ? 
  i do n't see how the `` crime wave of 1960s '' can explain it . 
  legislation usually occurs with some delay and increase in incarceration rates due to longer prison sentences also only show up once people have been in prison longer than they would have been under the old sentences . 
  the main things that happened at the political level were called `` nixon '' and `` reagan '' and a general political shift towards conservatism . 
   iow the crime rate dropped ~ 50 % in 20 years , yet twice more people are in prison . 
  if not private prison lobbying , how do you explain this ? 
  have a look at [ proposition 184 ] ( https://ballotpedia.org/california_proposition_184,_the_three_strikes_initiative_\\ ( 1994 \\ ) ) in 1994 , which passed with 71.8 % of the popular vote . 
  there was no private prison lobby behind it , just anger at a couple of ugly crimes . 
  as for the drop in crime rates : again , these take effect only with delay ; as crimes go down , the number of newly sentenced prisoners also goes down , but somebody serving 25 to life will be in prison before and after . 
  nope . 
  private prisons are a fairly recent phenomenon , make up only a small minority of prisons , and could n't explain the magnitude of the difference , anyway . 
  the root cause was the crime wave of the 1960s and populist demands for politicians ( and elected judges and other officials ) to be `` tough on crime '' . 
  this was very much driven by voters . 
  remember that three-strike laws were frequently enacted or strengthened by popular initiative . 
  a majority of american voters , in short , approve of a criminal justice system with a strong retributive component . 
  recent attempts to improve the situation have been primarily driven by government officials who have to deal with the fallout from retributive sentencing . 
   the german country has been doing great things , i do not think `` spending '' money on useless things is something i would prefer countries follow on . 
  agreed . 
  however , as the article notes , germany has plenty of * useful * things that it could spend money on , so this would n't be a problem . 
  this is absolutely normal . 
  as in many other parliaments , most of the actual work happens in committee meetings . 
  the debates primarily serve to inform the public ; for that , not every mp has to be present , and they could get little actual work done while listening to somebody else talking . 
  roll-call votes , such as for the same-sex marriage law , are one of the exceptions , because there everybody 's vote is recorded ( plus , mps were free to vote their conscience on a controversial subject ) ; for other occasions , it is generally sufficient to have a subset of mps present whose numbers reflect the relative majorities of the parties . 
  interparty agreements ( similar in spirit to pairing agreements in the british house of commons ) , along with the possibility of quorum calls , ensure that this is n't abused . 
  this was the final reading of the law , which had already been cycled through various and sundry committees , debated , picked apart , and amended ; there was n't going to be any last minute surprise change or any intra-coalition conflict that could have called the vote in question , so there was no point for most of the mps to participate in a glorified photo op . 
   how will the biggest trade block in the world ever find 5-7 extra billions a year ? 
  there are other options , too . 
  the eu 's budget is not like a nation 's budget in that only a minority of its expenditures involve constant obligations . 
  it currently takes in approximately 1 % of gdp of each member state , spends about 6 % of the total on actually running the eu , and basically redistributes the rest through various programs . 
  you can see the redistributive effect [ in this table ] ( http://english.eu.dk/en/faq/faq/net_contribution ) . 
  the rate of contributions is set as part of the [ multiannual financial framework ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiannual_financial_framework ) . 
  there are a number of options the eu has : 1 . 
  change nothing . 
  this will lead to poorer countries benefiting less from the redistributive effects , but contributions stay the same . 
  raise contributions from 1 % of gdp to about 1.05 % of gdp for all member states ( this is still going to be a net increase in receipts for poorer member states ) . 
  about the level it was for the previous mff . 
  make contributions more progressive , i.e. 
  richer member states paying proportionately more .
