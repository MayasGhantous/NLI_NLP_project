   your country had no problem outlawing nazi salutes the ban on nazi salutes ( and nsdap symbols in general ) is a side effect of the ban of the nsdap as basically a criminal organization ( enacted , incidentally , while germany was under allied control ) . 
  you can not effectively ban a party if it can just be reconstituted under a different name , using the same symbols as before . 
  [ which , obviously , is something that would never happen in america . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_control_act_of_1954 )  and expressing disbelief of the holocaust . 
  under germany 's equivalent of the [ `` false statements of fact '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_statements_of_fact ) exception to freedom of speech , and restricted to instances where denying the holocaust is able to endanger the public peace . 
  ( mind you , i think that it 's unnecessary and quite likely counterproductive , but the law against holocaust denial is the absolutely least problematic restriction on freedom of speech that germany has . ), 
  that 's a uk thing ; the us senate , for example , can not be overruled by the house of representatives , either . 
  i honestly find much of his argument to be borderline dishonest . 
  take his criticism of the council of the eu , for example . 
  the council is the * upper house * of the european legislature , and upper houses rarely are elected following the one person one vote rule . 
  the us senate is n't , the german bundesrat is n't , and the british house of lords is n't even elected . 
  and that 's perfectly fine . 
  nobody thinks that america , germany , or the uk are n't democracies because of that . 
  having both the lower and upper house elected using the same rules rarely serves a good purpose , as they 'd have majorities that operate in lockstep . 
  the point of an upper house is generally to introduce another veto point to safeguard another constitutional principle in addition to popular interest ( which is what the lower house is there for ) . 
  in the eu the council as the upper house protects the interests of the member states and the principle of subsidiarity ( a similar role to what the upper houses of the american and german legislatures have , at least in theory ) . 
  it exists so that the european parliament as the lower house ca n't have a `` tyranny of the majority '' where a left-of-center or right-of-center majority legislates its political preferences for the entire eu without their say-so . 
  similarly , his claim that the european commission is appointed and not elected is misleading in the extreme . 
  the european parliament both has the power to elect and to remove the commission and the nomination of the commission president is de facto the ep 's prerogative and has been for over a decade . 
  in fact , it was the uk along with hungary who opposed that and wanted the member state governments ( through the european council , not to be confused with the council of the eu ) retain the power to pick the commission president . 
  the member states do get to nominate the individual commissioners ( other than the president ) , but they have to pass a vote in the european parliament . 
  now , he does have some valid points , but most of these are overstated and he misses out on lots of valid criticism that ca n't be phrased in a demagogic fashion and would first require admission that there 's also something right . 
  the [ actual data ] ( http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2016/07/uk-real-wages-decline-10-severe-oecd-equal-greece/ ) does not seem to support that claim . 
  yes , but part of the reason for having your own currency is that you can devalue the currency rather than internally deflating your wages ; yet , britain still deflated its wages . 
  note that i 'm a bit more critical of the euro than the op , but he or she has a point that britain did n't really use having its own currency to its own advantage as much as it could have ( outside of qe ) . 
   that 's where merits come from . 
  that 's not what merit means , at least not in the sense of meritocracy . 
  merit is about objective ability and talent , and not * social perception * of a person 's value . 
   you mean whoever you vote for wo n't be worse than another one ? 
  your original claim was that by restricting yourself to a subset of possible candidates you would n't be able to choose the best candidates . 
  i pointed out that , regardless of how you define best , that 's not realistically true , because by any conceivable metric , the absolute top of the range is massively overpopulated ; you have to many candidates where you ca n't even tell who is better than the other . 
   still the parties have to take into consideration current social trends . 
  if there are indications that , say , people would vote for women , it would be stupid to not include women on parties ' lists . 
  which has nothing to do with merit and only with social norms . 
   i simply do n't know how is your 1 % related to difference between superbly qualified women and superbly qualified men . 
  it means that even if you narrowly restrict yourself to the best 1 % -- at which point , it becomes nearly impossible to tell differences , because you ca n't just assign a numeric rating -- the pool of possible candidates is so vast that you wo n't have to give up a candidate for a worse one even if you introduce arbitrary restrictions . 
  i know that there are exceptions . 
  my point was that it only affects naturalization , not ius sanguinis citizenship . 
   is n't it still based on people voting ? 
  candidates are chosen by the parties . 
  in any event , voting is rarely meritocratic . 
   what do you mean ? 
  what is unclear about what i wrote ? 
  germany not allowing dual citizenship only applies to the naturalization process , not if you have citizenship from birth . 
  in the case of people whose parents/grandparents were stripped of citizenship by the nazi regime , it 's not naturalization , but the restoration of birthright citizenship , something that was illegally taken from you and your ancestors and should never have happened in the first place . 
  political positions are currently to a large extent filled through `` old boys ' networks '' ( regardless of country ) . 
  the assumption that the existing system is a meritocracy is ... rather optimistic . 
  even if you wanted to make being the `` top 1 % '' of registered voters a precondition for a job in parliament , you 'd have over 200,000 french men and women each to choose from ( assuming `` top 1 % '' is even meaningful in politics ) . 
  you could have an entire parliament filled only with superbly qualified women , where ( in terms of qualification ) you could n't tell the difference from a parliament of just superbly qualified men under a microscope . 
   edit : if i am incorrect , if so , explain my mistake ? 
  the quota program is about resettling refugees from greece and italy in order to provide relief for these countries . 
  these are refugees that you yourself defined as `` real refugees '' . 
  in addition , for the legal definition of a refugee per the convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees it only matters if your home country ( or country where you 're habitually resident ) is safe , not where and how you fled . 
  passing through a safe third country * may * affect your asylum procedure ( in that you sometimes can be sent back to it ) , but it does n't change your status as a refugee . 
  if you 're fleeing from ( say ) political persecution , this just means that you may get asylum in that safe third country instead , but you 're still a refugee . 
  productivity in the economic sense has little to do with working hard , but more with value added per hour worked , which is largely dependent on the type of work you do . 
  a carpenter may be working harder than somebody in the financial services industry , but the financial services person will add more to the gdp per hour worked . 
  this is also why countries with lots of important natural resources tend to rank comparatively high . 
   the only answer is that the vote was held in secret , or informally without a record . 
  informally ? 
  possible . 
  as you probably know , not all votes in the commons [ require a division ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/division_of_the_assembly#house_of_commons ) , if there 's a clear and unambiguous majority . 
  but to assume that the british parliament votes `` in secret '' is serious tinfoil hat territory . 
  it is an act of parliament . 
  do you seriously believe that an act of parliament can be enacted without an actual vote ? 
  in fact , we can see in the hansard on 16/02/2006 the following notification of the bill having received royal assent after votes in both the commons and the lords :  the speaker notified the house , in accordance with the royal assent act 1967 , that her majesty had signified her royal assent to the following acts , agreed upon by both houses :  racial and religious hatred act 2006  european union ( accessions ) act 2006  equality act 2006  terrorism ( northern ireland ) act 2006  transport ( wales ) act 2006 . 
  this does not square with the economic realities , sorry . 
  it 's about taxes and transfers , not minorities . 
  if you compare income inequality [ before and after taxes and transfers ] ( https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/inequality-of-incomes-before-and-after-taxes-and-transfers.png ) , you will see that inequality in the us before taxes and transfers is about the same as in germany and france . 
  but while taxes and transfers in germany and france reduce income inequality to a gini of about .29 , the us ends up with a gini of about .39 . 
  it 's really not any more complicated than that . 
  where minorities come into play is that in america race -- via discrimination and historical lack of social mobility -- plays a disproportionate role in who gets the poorly-paying jobs , not how many there are ( this is determined by the structure of the economy ) . 
  check the [ european union ( accessions ) act 2006 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_%28accessions%29_act_2006 ) , for example . 
  i did n't say that the people supported it . 
  it 's just one more example of the british government making the eu a scapegoat for its own decisions . 
  accession to the eu treaties requires a treaty change that needs to be unanimously approved by all member states . 
  the uk actually pushed particularly hard for the eastern enlargement of the eu , [ especially the conservatives ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/21/tories-conservatives-eu-enlargement-bulgaria ) . 
  the uk then largely waived its right ( that germany and austria availed themselves of ) to [ have restrictions on freedom of movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_european_union#free_movement_issues ) for a transitional period . 
  it has less to do with lobbying laws and is more of an indirect effect . 
  american elections are horribly expensive . 
  winning the average senate seat will put you back some $ 10 million or so ( there are seats that are considerably more expensive ) . 
  house seats are a relative bargain at a bit over $ 1 million a pop on average . 
  this gives rich american companies a lot of leverage over members of congress , even though there are laws that limit the amount of direct donations . 
  it also tends to put rich americans in congress , who on balance tend be more favorably predisposed towards corporate interests . 
  american implementation of [ antitrust law ] ( http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/03/our-four-decade-antitrust-experiment-has-failed ) has become increasingly forgiving of monopolist behavior as long as it was supposedly in the best interest of consumers ( even if the consumer benefits were short-lived and were soon outstripped by a resulting lack of competitition ) . 
  this is less likely to happen in the eu , which -- as a polity that spans dozens of countries -- lacks homegrown monopolies that transcend borders [ 1 ] . 
  i note that i 'm not saying that eu politicians are inherently more saintly than american politicians ( any liberal democracy should work on the assumption that power corrupts and build checks and balances into its systems ) , but that the mechanisms at play lessen the actual leverage that corporations have in the eu . 
  [ 1 ] some people complain that the eu does not have companies such as google , microsoft , amazon , or apple . 
  but this is not all bad . 
  while one can argue about how the eu could better support innovation , having lots of big and influential monopolists ( or near-monopolists ) has its share of downsides . 
  i 'm talking about the phrases `` democratic republic '' and `` democratic people 's republic '' as a whole , not the constituent words on their own . 
  it 's the same thing as with a `` people 's republic '' , or worse , a `` democratic people 's republic '' . 
  it 's simply nomenclature that disguises substantive shortcomings ( and by shortcomings , i mean `` doing the opposite of what you claim to be '' ) . 
   you saw a lot of bitching about the fines the u.s. imposed on db - but similar fines had been imposed against other financial institutions years earlier , because they 'd fucking cooperated . 
  all the reporting that i read said that deutsche bank got off easy ? 
  ( [ example ] ( https://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/12/23/doj-bestows-early-christmas-present-financial-giant-deutsche-bank ) . ), 
  that 's got nothing to do with things being `` local '' . 
  phillips and siemens were hit with hefty fines in the past , too . 
  the problem is that the european commission only has the powers that have been explicitly delegated to it . 
  the difference is that the european commission has broad authority to regulate anti-competitive conduct , but little power over the car industry .
