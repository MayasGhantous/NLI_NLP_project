  greece , hungary , etc. 
  can indeed impose penalties for illegal entry and presence ( except in the rare cases where refugees actually come directly from the country they are fleeing ) . 
  they can not , however , revoke your status as a refugee as a result . 
  that status depends solely on article 1 . 
  and while you 're a refugee , you have rights under the convention . 
  these countries can deport a refugee to a safe country ; however , deportation requires that the receiving country accepts the refugee . 
  and the core problem is that none of the safe countries the refugees have passed through are willing to accept the refugees back . 
  and they can not deport them to their home country as long as that home country is n't safe . 
  the canadian integration process is honestly not all that different from what germany does these days ; you may have noticed that the kids that you saw in the first part of the documentary had been taught more or less the same things as the canadian immigrants . 
  as far as the point system goes , it is currently actually much harder for a non-eu citizen without a college degree to immigrate to germany than to canada , let alone obtain citizenship . 
  a point system is being discussed as an alternative for making immigration for qualified individuals * easier * . 
  currently , the bulk of immigrants ( not counting asylum seekers ) comes from within the eu ; net migration from turkey is actually negative . 
  with respect to asylum seekers , canada has the advantage that an asylum seeker has to cross either an ocean or the united states first . 
  many of the current problems stem from the guest worker years , when german companies practically hired entire villages from rural turkey to work in germany without any attempts at integration whatsoever . 
  many of them settled permanently in germany while retaining their original culture and parallel societies developed as a result . 
   whatever the reason , refugees believe they are welcome to germany . 
  they believe that because newspapers like the spectator spread misinformation . 
  this only makes mandatory decriminalization of illegal entry and presence contingent on coming directly from such a country . 
  entering illegally does not strip you of your other rights as a refugee . 
  your status as a refugee depends solely on what 's going on in your home country . 
  see article 1 ( and the protocol ) . 
  a lot will depend on whether he expects to actually implement these policies ( after all , he wo n't run labour as a dictator ) or whether this is more of an attempt to move the [ overton window ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overton_window ) to the left . 
  even more will depend on the uk 's economic situation in 2020 , which nobody can predict at this point . 
  if the economy is chugging along nicely , then the conservatives are likely to stay in power , no matter what labour does ( as long as fptp remains in place ) ; if the country is undergoing a recession , then there 's a good chance that the government will be kicked out just because . 
  deep policy analysis goes only so far where voters are concerned ; 5 % unemployment will almost certainly keep you in office , 15 % unemployment will almost certainly get you kicked out ( because the alternative ca n't really be any worse ) . 
  in between , it 's anybody 's guess . 
  i 'm not sure about your point , since my comment above does not assume they come directly from syria ; the opposite , in fact . 
   the european commission , has proposed that the eu should take 160,000 refugees . 
  this marks a considerable increase on the 40,000 the commission proposed last july . 
  but there are already 4m syrian refugees living outside their country . 
  germany alone expects to get 800,000 asylum applications , from syria and elsewhere , this year . 
  sigh . 
  at least the ft should be able to get the facts right . 
  this plan is about ** relocating refugees from hungary , greece , and italy to the rest of the eu ** ( [ source ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-junker-proposes-new-refugee-quota-plan-1441792202 ) , [ non-paywalled infographic ] ( http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/wo-ax792b_eumig_9u_20150909190320.jpg ) ) . 
  it 's about fixing the dublin regulation ( at least temporarily ) . 
  it 's not about `` taking refugees '' , it 's about providing relief for these three countries . 
  seriously , have they fired all their fact checkers or is this kind of lazy journalism the new normal ? 
  well , there is article 31 ( 1 ) of the convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees . 
  under article 31 , criminal sanctions shall not be imposed  on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1 , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence as a result , many countries generally decriminalize illegal entry or presence for refugees in general without being too strict on the letter of the rule for coming * directly * from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened . 
  a practical concern is also that there are some limits on the penalties you can reasonably impose . 
  refugees usually ca n't pay fines and if you want to impose prison sentences , then you generally only fill up your prisons and delay deportation proceedings . 
  deportations are mostly a practical impossibility at the moment , but it remains to be seen whether prison sentences buy hungary anything . 
  hungary has way more refugees than prisoners at the moment and it 's doubtful that there is enough prison space or if short prison sentences are in any way a meaningful deterrent . 
  well , the point of the quota system would be to relocate refugees ** away from ** hungary ( and greece and italy ) . 
  it might be to encourage them to vote ** for ** such a measure , though . 
  it is pretty much impossible for a politician not to say something that ca n't be taken out of context . 
  the real problem here is the modern brand of clickbait journalism that aims at gaining traction through social media links . 
   assuming you understand german , how would you explain this ? 
  by [ reading the entire interview ] ( http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/angela-merkel-das-grundrecht-auf-asyl-kennt-keine-obergrenze-aid-1.5383275 ) and not quoting a sentence fragment taken out of context . 
  better still , by considering the entire policy of the german government . 
   she 's not a fresh politician that may not know the downsides to the `` we welcome all syrians '' part of her speech and how it would be a juicy soundbite . 
  please provide an actual citation for that speech . 
  thank you . 
   does anybody still believe she said `` everybody come in '' ? 
  an echo chamber does not concern itself with silly things such as facts . 
  after reading the actual proposal , i 'm not sure what the `` threat '' is . 
  dublin in it 's current form is n't working anymore , insofar as sending refugees back to countries of entry has stopped being an option in most cases ; so any `` threat '' of having to leave dublin would be rather toothless . 
  if anything , having a more equitable system for relocating refugees might actually benefit switzerland in that incoming refugees may be moved from switzerland to other countries . 
  if not , they can opt out of the new version of dublin and should n't see much of a difference . 
  it does n't even show the maximum speed that the connection is capable of , because that can be impaired by many other things . 
  the problem is that if you 've already got a 50-100 mbit/s connection , most people are happy and do n't care about higher speeds ( 100 mbit/s is the rough equivalent of watching 20 netflix hd videos in parallel ) . 
  so , upgrading to ftth is costly , but you have few customers who will pay for that , because only a small minority will actually need it . 
  and without customers paying for it , you wo n't get the investors to fund it . 
  conversely , if you build a network more or less from scratch , you can put in the most advanced tech you have available at that moment at little additional cost . 
   german government [ relaxed ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-cabinet-bill-eases-rules-for-asylum-seekers/a-18028279 ) rules on asylum seekers . 
  this article provides only a very abbreviated view of a single cabinet decision that is part of a more complex long-term legislative push to streamline and realign the asylum process in germany . 
  this streamlining includes both changes that are favorable for refugees and changes that are not . 
  a common theme is avoiding complex discretionary administrative processes ; this includes things such as declaring certain countries to be safe countries of origin ( making denials of applications easier in obvious cases ) and simplifying benefits schemes . 
   or the german president [ welcoming ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30599339 ) immigrants in his christmas speech . 
  if you check [ the actual speech ] ( http://www.bundespraesident.de/shareddocs/reden/de/joachim-gauck/reden/2014/12/141225-weihnachtsansprache-2014.html ) , you will find that he did n't actually say that . 
  or anything like it . 
  the bbc article does some pretty heavy editorializing . 
  google is not your friend here ; it 'll give you anything from short summary articles up to and including downright misleading ones ; you wo n't get the nitty-gritty details of actual policymaking and you wo n't be shown the bigger picture . 
  popularity does not equal accuracy . 
  it 's essentially confirmation bias writ large . 
  it has been posted several times , actually . 
  for example , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hr2uj/riot_breaks_out_at_overcrowded_refugee_camp_in/ ) and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jgm7z/koranintoilet_triggers_riot_in_suhl/ ) and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hsodg/germany_refugee_riots_injure_15_after_koran/ ) . 
   that is total nonsense . 
  she has invited the massive wave by her policy . 
  citation needed . 
  just because this is a claim that is being regurgitated on this sub day after day does n't make it true . 
  nah , i 'm more surprised at how thoroughly uninformed a professor of politics can be on matters of policy . 
  it does n't matter one whit whether the refugees are fingerprinted in hungary or germany ** as long as germany ca n't send them back to hungary ** . 
  yes , the rules ( dublin iii ) are there for a reason , but that reason is for the ( poor ) eu periphery to serve as a refugee umbrella for the ( rich ) eu core . 
  the sooner the eu gets rid of this and distributes the burden in a more equitable fashion , the better [ 1 ] . 
  nor has germany actually behaved hippie-like ( i do wonder , though , what that comparison says about the good professor ? 
  ) ; germany has made the following policy decisions , none of which should be remotely controversial : 1 . 
  not to deport syrian asylum seekers that arrive in germany back to a country of entry because of their virtually 100 % acceptance rate and because the eu periphery ca n't take anymore . 
  taking a small amount of refugees in from hungary to provide temporary relief for hungary . 
  seek a more equitable distribution ( based on population and gdp ) of refugees in europe ( this is honestly what dublin iii should have been from the start ) . 
  internally , process asylum applications faster , handle integration faster in the case of successful applications , deport faster in cases where the application was denied . 
  angela merkel is not and has never been a hippie . 
  she 's a populist and a thoroughly ruthless politician . 
  she 's been doing the absolute minimum necessary to keep the situation under control ( that she can unilaterally do ) and nothing more . 
  the rest is pretty much the invention of reporters trying to create a narrative and anthropomorphize nation states . 
  [ 1 ] and yes , ideally we want there to be fewer refugees , but that 's easier said than done . 
   the best solution is we treat them like shit once they get here , put them in prisoner camps and just make sure they 're as uncomfortable as possible and hopefully they 'll get the message . 
  good look with getting this past the national courts or the ecthr . 
   again , these are not refugees fleeing war and seeking safety , because they 're already safe in jordan and turkey . 
  that 's not relevant for the definition of a refugee under international law , actually .
