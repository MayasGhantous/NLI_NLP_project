  according to the convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees , a refugee is somebody who :  owing to wellfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it . 
  coming from turkey only matters for purposes of article 31 of the convention , which decriminalizes illegal entry when coming directly from a territory where their life was threatened . 
  note that fleeing from war does not necessarily make you a refugee , but even then the [ principle of non-refoulement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-refoulement ) under customary international law applies : nobody can be deported to a country where their life is at risk . 
  the problem is not finding people in refugee camps or deporting people who are n't refugees ( well , it can be a logistical challenge , but not a serious political or legal problem ) . 
  the problem is what to do with refugees who are fleeing from war or political or religious persecution once they 've arrived on your territory . 
  it may surprise you , but germany 's and austria 's policies are pretty much the same as the uk 's . 
  germany not wanting to take more refugees ** was exactly why the dublin regulation was created in the first place ** . 
  refugees are coming to the core of the eu now because the eu periphery where most refugees are entering have stopped playing umbrella . 
  but germany and austria have no countries to send most refugees in back to ( especially from syria ) . 
  the only countries they could in theory be sent back to ( hungary , turkey , greece , syria ) are n't options anymore because that would result in germany and austria violating constitutional and international law . 
  ( and , frankly , because hungary , greece , and turkey would simply refuse , and sending them back to syria would violate too many laws and treaties to count . ), 
  the uk is in a more advantageous situation solely because it is an island , which makes getting there rather more difficult for refugees . 
  again : once you have refugees that are on your soil , you 're generally stuck with them ( turkey has n't invited all the two million refugees it currently has , either ) . 
  deporting non-refugees is ( legally ) easy . 
  ignoring refugees in another country is also easy . 
  deporting refugees can be impossible . 
  a quick translation ( with some annotations in square brackets ) :  `` it is import to clarify the following : those who need protection shall get protection . 
  those who can not expect to remain will have to leave our country . 
  and therefore we also talked about removing perverse incentives . 
  this means that cash benefits at initial reception centers shall be replaced by in-kind benefits . 
  a key concept will be that of safe countries of origin \\ [ probably for determining who will get only in-kind benefits ; this had been discussed before ] . 
  cash benefits will be paid at most a month in advance and social benefits will be reduced for those who are required to leave \\ [ because their application for asylum/stay of deportation was denied and the decision was final ] . 
  those who are required to leave will also \\ [ actually ] have to leave the country . '', 
  if you are an interpreter , you ca n't have a systemic understanding of the asylum process , and given that asylum seekers with an unknown country of origin [ make up 1 % -1.5 % of asylum seekers ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states,_2013_and_2014_yb15_iii.png ) would indicate that anecdotal evidence is insufficient . 
  my point exactly : an account with over 1k comment karma and very few actual comments smells of being curated so as not to be caught in contradictions when people look at your account history . 
   i have worked in many different countries for several immigration departments . 
  no , you have n't ; nobody get 's entrusted with the exercise of one of a country 's sovereign rights for `` many different countries '' . 
  and your extremely short and recent account history is another dead giveaway that you 're making stuff up from whole cloth . 
  [ far from all asylum seekers ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states,_2013_and_2014_yb15_iii.png ) come from syria . 
  it does n't really mean `` economic liberalism '' . 
  it its normal usage in europe , the term refers to [ classical liberalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classical_liberalism ) . 
   in which case , why is europe taking in people who 've already reached a safe harbor ( without some sort of agreement with turkey to help ease its burden ) ? 
  first , because you can not send them back to turkey if turkey wo n't accept them . 
  there 's a turkey-eu readmission agreement , but the only result of sending large numbers of refugees back to turkey is going to be turkey withdrawing from that agreement . 
  short story : you can not make a sovereign country do something that it really , really does n't want to do . 
  turkey , on a per capita basis , is shouldering a much , much higher burden than the much richer western countries , so the west gets pretty much zero sympathy lamenting about how we 're being overwhelmed . 
  second , because the national laws of several member states ( plus the echr in many cases ) do not allow them to send refugees back to turkey ( or greece or hungary , for that matter ) while those countries are operating beyond capacity and acceptable conditions for refugees can not be guaranteed . 
   that pretty much puts the lie to their being any sort of refugees . 
  nope : it just means that the countries bordering on syria are finally overflowing and can not handle any more . 
  note also that a huge chunk of syrian asylum seekers have actually come to europe under a unhcr resettlement program and mostly did n't go through turkey at all ( though many were taken from lebanon and jordan to provide some relief for those countries ) . 
  the problem that minimum pricing tries to address ( which taxes do n't ) is businesses using alcoholic beverages as a loss leader . 
  it 's basically a very targeted predatory pricing law , justified by the effects that wide availability of cheap booze has on public health . 
   your numbers are old . 
  thanks , mine were the ones i could quickly find . 
  in any event , that reinforces my point that syrians primarily flee to neighboring countries even more . 
  even for syrian refugees , it 's not really correct . 
  that 's the telegraph editorializing . 
   well , it became that since merkel commented on allowing all refugees in . 
  this is not actually what the german government said . 
  the gulf states are n't signatories to the convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees , while the eu member states are . 
  the refugee convention specifically deals with the lack of visas and work permits . 
  ( note that lebanon and jordan are n't signatories , either , but respect the principle of non-refoulement under customary international law . ), 
  as for your third point , the following is what the article starts with and what the comment about distance refers to :  although those fleeing the syrian crisis have for several years been crossing into lebanon , jordan and turkey in huge numbers , entering other arab states - especially in the gulf - is far less straightforward . 
  this is not about comparing travel distance between the gulf states and europe , but between the gulf states and lebanon , jordan , and turkey . 
  syrian refugees by region ( [ source ] ( http://www.unhcr.at/uploads/tx_n4mteaserobjects/unhcr_report_on_syrian_refugees_in_europe.pdf ) ) : 1 . 
  turkey : 789,678 3 . 
  jordan : 602,182 4 . 
  iraq : 225,475 5 . 
  egypt : 138,101 5 . 
  europe : 123,600 ( this does not account for the about 6.5 million people displaced * within * syria ) . 
  more perspective : total annual public spending in germany is some $ 1.2 trillion . 
  [ this ] ( http://thelearningcurve.pearson.com/index/index-ranking ) seems to be the ranking in question . 
  while there are likely to be problems with greek education ( especially given the current economic situation ) , i 'd take the ranking with a lot of salt . 
  first of all , several of the indicators are of questionable validity . 
  for example , the timss is a curriculum-based math test , and it does not always match any given country 's curriculum . 
  for another example , tertiary graduation rate is essentially meaningless for cross-country comparisons . 
  see , e.g. , switzerland , which has a low tertiary type a graduation rate because of its strong apprenticeship system that does not make going to college always the best career choice ( and in other countries , going to college is often a de facto substitute for vocational training ) . 
  germany made a unilateral declaration to not apply a specific part of the dublin regulation to syrians , i.e. 
  to not send them back to where they entered the eu if they applied for asylum in germany instead . 
  the press then made a complete ( and very sensationalized ) hash of it , which is where the confusion comes from . 
  the german government 's official statement was :  `` dublin procedures of syrian citizens are currently as far as possible factually not carried out by the federal office of migration and refugees . 
  asylum procedures that are not concluded yet will be processed in germany . 
  this new regulation is a guideline , not a binding formal directive . '', 
  there is no need to clarify anything ; dublin allows governments to voluntarily process asylum seekers that apply for asylum in their country instead of sending them back to the country of entry , it 's just usually done on a case-by-case basis . 
  a government doing this does not absolve other governments of their obligations under dublin ( no matter how misguided dublin 's original design is ) . 
  that said , it would generally be a good idea to alleviate hungary 's ( and greece 's , etc. ), 
  burden and let more of the richer eu countries contribute their fair share , but that happens to be a matter of much contention at the moment . 
  grad students are cheap labor for universities the world over . 
   when was the last time a uk proposal of a change in the eu caused even an official level discussion , let alone a vote ? 
  well , the two eastern enlargements of the eu were [ directly championed by the british government ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/21/tories-conservatives-eu-enlargement-bulgaria ) ; the british government was successful in getting those adopted ( though nobody repealed the law of unintended consequences ) . 
  the data retention directive was pushed through by the blair government in the aftermath of the 2005 london bombings . 
  it was eventually killed by the ecj in its current form , but it was passed even against the vehement objections of the european parliament 's german alde rapporteur . 
  for a more recent overview of british influence on eu policymaking , see [ here ] ( http://www.britishinfluence.org/scorecard ) . 
   easy for facebook to move their door knocker to the uk . 
  the uk also has laws against the incitement of racial hatred . 
  they are actually pretty common in europe . 
   german law means fuck all in dublin . 
  it 's a different country . 
  the brussels i regulation , i.e. 
  the `` council regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters '' , ( and for criminal matters , the eaw ) says otherwise when it comes to the enforcement of court orders . 
  of course , it 's unlikely that it would come that far , since it 's highly improbable that facebook 's german subsidiary could evade court orders to such an extent to make this necessary . 
   what 's ireland got to do with it ? 
  facebook dublin is facebook 's european hq . 
   german laws are not european laws . 
  ireland actually has similar laws regarding the incitement of racial hatred , which should make the enforcement of court orders against facebook dublin relatively easy . 
  facebook has german and irish subsidiaries . 
  what makes you think that they are outside the jurisdiction of the german or european courts ? 
  this was exactly what maas pointed out : they are doing business in germany , so they have to obey german laws . 
  it would be different if they were a purely american company with no presence in germany . 
  no need to tell me .
