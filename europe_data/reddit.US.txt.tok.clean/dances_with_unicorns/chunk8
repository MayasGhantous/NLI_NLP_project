  the only mechanisms with significant countercyclical capability outside the central banks are the public strategic investment banks of * some * countries , notably germany 's kfw and spain 's ico . 
  going from a reporting rate of 10 % to 11.8 % honestly would n't be much of a change . 
  especially over five years . 
   germans have to fight for higher wages !, 
  you 're late to the party . 
  real wages in germany [ have been rising since q1 2014 ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/presseservice/presse/pressemitteilungen/2015/07/pd15_245_623.html ) , days lost to strikes [ have been rising since 2010 ] ( http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article139949585/willkommen-in-der-streikrepublik-deutschland.html ) and are going to hit a [ record high this year ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-mark-record-year-for-strikes/a-18450024 ) . 
  also , the german government instituted a statutory minimum wage of $ 8.50 in january . 
   the german economy is driven by comparativly low wages and therfore the missing domestic demand is substitued by the massive exports . 
  not really . 
  hourly labor costs in germany [ are n't particularly low ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/hourly_labour_costs ) and salaries in the export sector are pretty high to begin with ( compensated for by fairly high productivity , leading to competitive unit labor costs ) . 
  the average annual wage is comparatively low only because germans work the second least hours per year in the eu ( after the netherlands ) . 
  real wages in other countries have stagnated or even deflated , too , which is part of why germany did n't have raises , either . 
  finally , a major reason why german exports have expanded is because germany has increasingly been able to sell to china ; a market where it 's pretty much guaranteed that a developed country ca n't underbid the local wages . 
  yes , germany needs to get its trade and current account surplus under control , but the story is more complicated than `` low wages '' . 
  for example , germans tend to be pretty risk-averse and less likely to take out loans and mortgages than people in other countries , leading to lower domestic consumption ; this is exemplified by the low rate of homeownership ( second only to switzerland ) . 
  germans are a nation of habitual savers , and it 's really hard to blame them for living within their means . 
  they are n't functionally identical . 
  the concept of `` moral rights '' , for example , is a major difference between anglo-american and continental european copyright law ( in theory , the us is obliged to implement moral rights per article 6bis of the berne convention , but in practice that only happened for vara and was handwaved away in general ) . 
  for another example , the concept of `` work for hire '' simply does not exist in continental europe and copyright assignment is legally impossible in several countries . 
  these differences are significant enough that they created major headaches for the uk in order to harmonize british and continental european practice ( british copyright law had more in common with the us than with continental europe ; statute of anne vs. kant and beaumarchais ) . 
  this is not to say that one or the other is better , but simply that it 's not accurate to describe them as functionally identical . 
  patent law also has significant differences . 
   as an example , the us extended its copyright term in the 70 's ( from 50 years from the death of the author to 70 years ) under pressure from european countries to conform to their 70-year period . 
  eh , this happened primarily because disney was afraid of the mickey mouse copyright expiring . 
  this is why the copyright term extension act is often ( mockingly ) called the mickey mouse protection act . 
  [ prisoner 's dilemma . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prisoner%27s_dilemma ), 
  i would guess that this has more to do with the selection of criteria for the hdi than with the atkinson index ; you can make composite indices say pretty much whatever you want , and the hdi for greece is n't that much worse than for the us even when not adjusted for inequality ( or at least was in 2013 ) . 
  keep in mind that , for example , greece has a higher life expectancy than the us and that american life expectancy is [ particularly bad for the poor ] ( http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/01/not-everyone-living-longer ) . 
  or that nearly 50 million americans ( out of a population of about 319 million ) [ live in food-insecure households ] ( http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/impact-of-hunger/hunger-and-poverty/ ) . 
  the ihdi uses the [ atkinson index with \u025b = 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atkinson_index ) to adjust the hdi . 
  intuitively , the atkinson index [ measures the loss of welfare due to inequality ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2652960/#__sec2title ) :  an intuitive interpretation of this index is possible : atkinson values can be used to calculate the proportion of total income that would be required to achieve an equal level of social welfare as at present if incomes were perfectly distributed . 
  for example , an atkinson index value of 0.20 suggests that we could achieve the same level of social welfare with only 1 -- 0.20 = 80 % of income . 
  the theoretical range of atkinson values is 0 to 1 , with 0 being a state of equal distribution . 
  so , ihdi = hdi * ( 1-a\u025b ) . 
  as for :  it sounds like `` sure there 's more infant mortality in that country but that 's ok because the top earners are relatively even worse off than low earners '' . 
  does n't make sense . 
  the atkinson index ( unlike the gini ) is subgroup decomposable , so if everyone is worse off ( or if you can arrange the populations so that each subgroup is worse off ) , then the value adjusted by the atkinson index is lower , too . 
  mathematically , 1-a\u025b is the quotient of the geometric mean and the arithmetic mean ( for \u025b = 1 ) , so higher inequality despite a higher or equal average value ( arithmethic mean ) implies that the geometric mean is much worse . 
  if you want to look at these kinds of composite indices , it really depends on which one you pick ; selection of factors and their relative weight matters a lot . 
  for example , the [ inequality-adjusted hdi ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-3-inequality-adjusted-human-development-index ) has the us on par with eastern europe and greece . 
  and if you look at the [ other chart in the context of something more than just brics countries ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/15/this-chart-might-make-you-feel-better-about-american-inequality/ ) , you 'll see that tim worstall cherry-picked that one and that in the developed world , the us looks more like italy , while things look better for the poor in denmark and germany ( and presumably the rest of the nordic countries , austria , and the netherlands , too ) . 
  plus , relative poverty in america typically results in social segregation , which is a big problem with being poor in the us : you grow up and live in poor ( and often crime-ridden ) neighborhoods , you 're dependent on crappy public transport that no middle class person would ever use , you have to send your children to struggling inner schools : you 're being set up to fail . 
  meanwhile , people in germany or the netherlands or denmark have trouble wrapping their minds around concepts such as `` food deserts '' or `` trailer parks '' , problems that are utterly alien to them [ 1 ] . 
  [ 1 ] example [ here ] ( http://theprotocity.com/food-deserts-fat-makers-or-fairy-tales/ ) : `` food deserts seem to be non-existent in amsterdam '' . 
   can germans clear up for me why it was ridiculous to start an investigation against these journalists ? 
  state secrets , per \u00a7 93 of the german penal code , are only those secrets that would pose a grave danger to germany 's ** external security ** [ 1 ] if revealed . 
  in particular , note that terrorism is a matter of internal security . 
  external security relates to operational intelligence , military deployments , membership in military alliances , and such . 
  but netzpolitik published documents that revealed information about the internal structure of the office for the protection of the constitution , which is germany 's ** domestic ** intelligence service . 
  you 'd have to squint really hard to find a threat to germany 's external security , let alone a grave one . 
  in short , there was no `` there '' there . 
  note that while leaking other government secrets is a crime for government officials , the law expressly makes it legal for journalists to publish those secrets once leaked , as long as they do nothing but receive , evaluate , and publish the information ( [ \u00a7 353 ( 3a ) of the german penal code ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p3016 ) ) . 
  and , of course , as long as they are n't state secrets per the definition \u00a7 93 . 
  [ 1 ] the german term is '' \u00e4u\u00dfere sicherheit '' and often translated as `` national security '' , but the contemporary use of `` national security '' is far more expansive and not really an accurate translation when talking about the law . 
  this sounds ... strangely familiar . 
  yeah , i think i 'd rather see an opt-in scheme , with prices in countries that have n't opted in being capped at the opt-in level . 
  the article also is n't very clear how this is going to work with the different vat levels across the eu . 
  related : may they finally move to end the vatmess problems for small and medium businesses ? 
  and how are national price fixing laws for e-books going to be affected ? 
  kohl is probably a special case ; without reunification , he may not have lasted that long . 
  merkel also benefits from unusual circumstances ; technically , there 's a left of center majority in the bundestag , and under other circumstances ( counterfactual alert ! ), 
  germany might have a social-democratic chancellor now , but the left party is still too toxic for the social democrats or greens to form a coalition with . 
  the federal prosecutor and the federal office for the protection of the constitution are both part of the federal government . 
  the federal prosecutor must follow the orders of the federal ministry of justice ; the federal office for the protection of the constitution is part of the federal ministry of the interior . 
   the charge was pressed by the president of the constitutional court , not the government jesus christ , no . 
  the charges were filed by the office for the protection of the constitution ( germany 's domestic intelligence service ) , which has nothing -- absolutely nothing -- to do with the constitutional court . 
   the thing is that you can not really avoid it if you want to keep in touch . 
  you absolutely can . 
  people who care enough will find other ways to stay in touch with you ( and vice versa ) . 
  note : the data protection commissioner of schleswig-holstein lost a similar case in 2013 , with the superior administrative court of schleswig-holstein ruling that facebook was only subject to irish data protection law ( where they are incorporated ) , not german law . 
  however , since then google spain v. aepd and mario costeja gonz\u00e1lez happened , and the cjeu ruled that a data controller doing business in a member state is subject to the data protection laws of that member state , in particular :  article 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) of directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning that processing of personal data is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller on the territory of a member state , within the meaning of that provision , when the operator of a search engine sets up in a member state a branch or subsidiary which is intended to promote and sell advertising space offered by that engine and which orientates its activity towards the inhabitants of that member state . 
  while the cjeu judgment talks about search engines , the underlying reasoning also applies to other internet services that process personal data . 
  the data protection commissioner of hamburg is now arguing that per the google ruling , facebook is likewise subject to german data protection law . 
  and per \u00a7 13 of the german telemedia act , a provider is required to permit anonymous or pseudonymous use where this is technically possible and reasonable . 
  actually , not all protests are lawful . 
  in germany , they must be registered with the authorities 48 hours before the event and they must not endanger public safety . 
  given that the german language reporting describes these incidents as `` straftaten '' ( crimes ) or `` delikte '' ( offenses ) , it appears that these indeed were n't lawful protests to begin with or had escalated . 
   the way you dismiss this as something that does n't even make much of a difference shows how the crisis looks different from outside than inside . 
  i would n't jump to conclusions just because of my flair . 
  i have been living in europe ( on the `` inside '' , as you call it ) for the past decade , ever since i married an english guy , and am half-german ( including dual citizenship and with a lot of family in central europe ) myself . 
  yes , i know that anything that smells like a transfer union is unpopular ; it being unpopular , however , does not mean that it can be avoided , especially if the alternative were to be the ez blowing up . 
   10 % unemployment rate . 
  i 'm not sure why you are limiting yourself to the lower end of the range i suggested , nor why you include croatia ( not a ez member ) or slovakia ( not a ez member for the majority of the time period you are looking it ) . 
  nor why you assume that the implicit stimulative and deficit-cutting effect of unemployment reinsurance would n't result in more economic growth and less unemployment , thus reducing unemployment rates . 
  a 10 % cutoff would obviously result in more frequent transfers ; a 15 % cutoff ( or something in between ) would limit this scheme to pretty catastrophic events . 
  my bigger concern would be that unemployment numbers are comparatively easy to fudge ; while there 's relatively little concern that governments will actively drive unemployment up ( not only would that still be a net negative , such governments would get voted out of power pretty fast ) , manipulating numbers might be a different story ( see the whole elstat mess ) . 
  also , to reiterate , while such a scheme * may * be enough , this is already taking an optimistic position ; in reality , we can expect that more is needed . 
  in any event , the current collection of kludges is unlikely to last forever . 
  for example , if italy ( with about nine times the gdp of greece ) were to get hit by a crisis comparable to that of greece , would the esm be able to handle that ? 
   keep in mind that unemployment rates in different countries of europe are permanently different . 
  this is what the deductible is for . 
  the point is not to have the ez contribute to a country 's unemployment benefits as a rule , but to offset the costs when they reach an unmanageable level . 
  have it kick in when unemployment reaches a certain threshold ( say , between 10 % -15 % ) . 
  these things are less permanent than they may appear ; e.g. , poland 's unemployment is currently about ten percentage points lower . 
  some countries may be net beneficiaries and some net contributors even over extended periods of time . 
  that 's normal for risk pooling systems . 
  the net contributors still benefit from not having to deal with the side effects of fiscal shocks or only with less severe ones . 
   even more so how is the sum set when wages and incomes are in completely different levels depending on nationality ? 
  that 'd be down to the actuaries to hash out .
