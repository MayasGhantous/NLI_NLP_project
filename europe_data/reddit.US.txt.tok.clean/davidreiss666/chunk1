also , there are holiday celebrations , sometimes local or regional things in the us , where everyone goes around saying `` kiss me , i 'm irish '' or st. patrick say . 
  dyngus day ( polish ) , italian or columbus day festivals , hellenic festival , etc. 
  where they were have street fairs , large community parties , etc. 
  especially in the north east and mid-west , where every major and many minor immigrant groups have celebration fairs and stuff about their heritage . 
  the local city has a old political saying about those running for office . 
  it does like this : welcome , this is where everyone is irish , even the english . 
  everyone is italian , even the greeks . 
  everyone is polish , even the germans . 
  and everyone is jewish , even the catholics . 
  every ethnic group has their celebration and every group invites all the others to be members of their group ... even if just for a weekend . 
  so , one of his right hand men , lavrentiy beria , was n't a corrupt sob ? 
  he defended soviet culture so well that being a culture that existed for centuries often got your entire town deported to the northern siberian waste land with the hope that you and your neighbors would die a horrible death . 
  trofim lysenko and lysenkoism , learning was so very valued that the idea of actually studying real biology and real evolutionary science got you sent to the gulag . 
  summoning marshal of the soviet union , / u/georgy _ k_zhukov , to deal with some of this crap in a bit more of an in-depth fashion . 
  i do a lot of spam stuff . 
  also , time-zone compensation .

  correct . 
  war plan red was the american plans from the pre-ww2 era for a hypothetical invasion of canada . 
  the british and canadian military created a plan called defence scheme no . 
  1 for a joint uk-canadain attack on the united states . 
  the were both created for hypothetical/what-if situations . 
  neither were actual real wars plans . 
  the em-50 project needs to be revived . 
  turkey dd much of the same to it 's own jewish population . 
  in 1948 there were about 80,000 jewish citizens of turkey . 
  today it 's about 17,000 . 
  the jewish people were forced out of pretty much all the arab world in the years immediately after the founding of israel . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_exodus_from_arab_and_muslim_countries in 1948 libya had about 35,000 jewish citizens . 
  the current jewish population of libya is so low that the official un estimate is zero . 
  i going to go out on a limb here , but i would bet hard currency that you do n't like how the word * literally * has taken to meaning `` figuratively '' in many contexts . 
  as in , i bet your head literally explodes when you hear it said aloud . 
  may i ask , have you ever once wondered in more than a joking or annoyed manner if any persons head ** literally ** exploded ? 
  / u/raerth , well ... 
  i had to be more popular than somebody . 
  i 'm just surprised it was you . 
  weird . 
  i do n't get it . 
  other mods - get me a beer , it 's not a popularity contest . 
  :-) especially / u/theskynet and / u/skuld ... you guys are terrible and evil and stuff . 
  but , knowing me ... that might be a good thing though . 
  or me . 
  most of the base list here was originally based on [ this list here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/liberal/wiki/newssources ) . 
  more specifically , mary was invited . 
  william happened to be her husband . 
  other than spam work , i leave most of the day to day stuff to the other mods . 
  there are some graphic artist guys who do the graphics . 
  theskynet is around to make sure every word in the english language has an official misspelling . 
  skuld is time actually traveling prince george from a post apocalyptic future where heavy metal has died out after the great burn . 
  aschebescher is here to keep us supplied in good low quality weird german nsfw content . 
  and beer . 
  pretty much , i 'm the normal person of the mod team . 
  there were other crusades , other than those against the muslims of the near east . 
  * [ albigensian crusade ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albigensian_crusade ) against the cathar movement in southern france . 
  * [ northern crusades ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades ) in the baltic region . 
  and the [ reconquista ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reconquista ) can be viewed through the lens of crusade as well . 
  i have one of the single most active accounts on reddit . 
  where would i find the time to have alt accounts ? 
  use some logic here . 
  also , do n't believe everything you read . 
  guess what , other people often like to lie . 
  i could make up a bunch of stories about you and post them everywhere ... it would n't make them true . 
  but it might make other people around reddit say `` hey , i heard that silly_crotch guy was the guy who murdered and ate the pope '' . 
  raerth is a european moderator in the us-zone of / r/politics . 
  and i contribute a lot of submissions to the subreddit . 
  many of which have been well liked . 
  and is n't theskynet actually living inside a salt mine in a mountain in colorado . 
  it 's just some terminal interface for him is active in the united kingdom at the moment . 
  he 's probably going to school over there for some reason . 
  or he thinks `` kill all humans '' sounds better in an english accent . 
  i 've made that very criticism of myself in a few places . 
  i get curt an short with people sometimes . 
  but then , i also step up and deal with some of the crazier people most others moderators ignore too . 
  i try and answer people , and for that i get a target painted on my back from time to time . 
  i 'll field this one ... that would be because the other mods here know the so-called stuff in subreddit drama is n't true . 
  i do n't get into many debates with people who like to lie about things because i do n't really care what they think about me . 
  i know the truth , my friends and co-moderators ( those people i respect ) know the truth ... and i do n't need to insist that i am innocent to people , who to be frank ... have no business involving themselves in my life . 
  thank you . 
  now , where is the moderator liquor cabinet ? 
  i need a drink , and i have a case of ouzo i need to put away . 
  ( and do n't tell the / r/technology guys i took the ouzo . ), 
  i removed a shit load of spam . 
  things that still need to be removed for being spam . 
  i do that same thing now at / r/getmotivated , / r/history , / r/bestof , / r/food , etc.
