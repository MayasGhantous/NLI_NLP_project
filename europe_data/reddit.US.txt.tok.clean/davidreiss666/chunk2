  spam is not a small problem and spam is still spam . 
  i had done more than 120k spam reports in my time on reddit . 
  that 's the second most of any mod ever on reddit . 
  only / u/kylde has done more spam reports . 
  considering i did n't remove the threads in question that you complained about before , that should tell you something right now . 
  but then , as i already pointed out ... you like to ignore actual facts . 
  in short , they are still being removed ; you just choose to ignore it . 
  good day to you . 
  you 're still cooler than she is . 
  not true . 
  i was the mod who took / r/history private . 
  / u/creesch later put it back online a few hours after / u/nallen made / r/science public again . 
  they were made public again because / u/kn0thing made threads in / r/modtalk and / r/defaultmods and seems to be addressing the issues . 
  getting his direct attention was the goal . 
  of course , the fact that it took several hours to get the attention is still a bit whacked . 
  people want to make crap up . 
  but then , they often like to do that because some people are just crazy . 
  i was removing racist bullshit from here . 
  things i continue to remove from other subreddits i mod to this day . 
  heck , the thread you guys complained because you thought i remove was ** not even removed by me ** . 
  it was removed by another mod of / r/europe who is ** still ** a mod here . 
  but i stood by his removal and continue to stand by it . 
  removal of that thread was the correct action . 
  it 's still removed at this time . 
  the current mod team here continues to remove similar threads every day . 
  not that you care really , because facts are actually unimportant to you . 
  racism and hate are a major problem on reddit . 
  we know this because the users of / r/europe have said it was a problem . 
  see these threads from / r/europe on the storm front problem : * https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1w3fnr/seems_we_are_important_enough_for_stormfront_to/ * https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2y0tbb/headsup_popular_neonazi_site_daily_stormer_is/ and it 's a problem faced by all of reddit . 
  for example , the definitive / r/history comment statement on the problem . 
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2puapu/alfred_hitchcocks_memory_of_the_camps_very_nsfw/cn0a25e?context=3 the history-based subreddits of / r/history , / r/historyporn , / r/askhistorians , / r/badhistory , etc. 
  all ban users for racist and hate-filled opinions every day . 
  be they racism , holocaust denial , neonazis , neoconfederates , pro-slavery or simple history-fact denial . 
  world war two happened , denying it will get you banned for that alone . 
  and no , the mod teams do n't care if you agree with how we mod the subreddits . 
  if you do n't like it , then you are free to unsubscribe at your earliest opportunity . 
  back to the issue of subreddits going private , / r/history was taken private after a long discussion among the mod team . 
  we were the fourth default subreddit to go private . 
  only a few minutes after / r/movies did so . 
  i was the one who made the setting change to take it private . 
  we then made it available again after the admins had made statements in various backroom mod-only subreddits . 
  / r/science had already decided that it was time to come back , and we followed suit because the admins will giving the stated mod-issues the required attention . 
  others links that explain what was happening follow : * [ outoftheloop thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/ ) * [ subreddit drama thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/ ) * [ bestof thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3bw7ms/top_mod_of_riama_explains_why_its_been_set_to/ ) in short , mods doing their jobs are important for reddit . 
  mod tools have not been updated in several years . 
  tools like / r/toolbox which were created by people like / u/creesch and / u/agentlame are stop gap measures that they themselves have asked for the admins to copy their work for the benefit of all communities on reddit . 
  i could continue to go on here , but you wo n't read it and are n't really interested in what i am saying . 
  but somebody else might be interested in the actual facts , and so i post this answer for them . 
  we were removing the other threads to clean up racist comments . 
  they were overwhelming the other threads . 
  not many other mods were around , and after a while we did recognize the the lack of any threads about this topic was a very bad idea all around . 
  so this thread was created to allow for the discussion to take place in a more controlled fashion . 
  there are now seven stories from major news organizations listed above . 
  and people can include links to other stories in their comments . 
  we ca n't just allow racists to overwhelm and control the discussion here . 
  this is not a perfect solution , but it 's the best solution we could come up with at the time . 
  it was a genocide . 
  that 's accepted by historians world wide .

  you are 100 % outside the mainstream world at this point and only hanging out with people who deny the holocaust of the jewish people during ww2 and [ other nuts ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3004yd/mindless_monday_23_march_2015/cpouqbe?context=3 ) . 
  to support what you say , i want to note that [ norman borlaug ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norman_borlaug ) supported gmos . 
  he saved the lives of billions of people in the [ green revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_revolution ) . 
  he was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1970 , when he was already well known for then having saved one billion lives . 
  today the numbers would be at least 3-4 billion human lives . 
  he was sure that if he had had access to gmo technology back when the green revolution was starting , that could have saved millions more . 
  in his quest to produce pest resistant forms of corn and wheat , they needed to produce tens of thousands of manually produced cross breeds . 
  you have to grow each of those cross breads , determine if they work , and then confirm that they work . 
  and while corn and wheat grow quickly , they still take weeks to months to grow . 
  all to find 5-10 individual breeds that met their initial requirements . 
  where as he figured that gmo produced strains would have saved his teams years worth of research time . 
  and in those years how many millions died of starvation ? 
  borlaug said a few things that i think are important and which i think address some of your detractors underlying yet unwarranted assumptions . 
  --  i now say that the world has the technology -- either available or well advanced in the research pipeline -- to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people . 
  the more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology ? 
  while the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low-risk positions , and pay more for food produced by the so-called `` organic '' methods , the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income , food-deficit nations can not . 
  --  some of the environmental lobbyists of the western nations are the salt of the earth , but many of them are elitists . 
  they have never experienced the physical sensation of hunger . 
  they do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in washington or brussels . 
  if they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world , as i have for fifty years , they would be crying out for tractors , and fertilizer , and irrigation canals , and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things . 
  -- in short , i think we need to head the words of borlaug . 
  he not only know what he was talking about , but he proved it time and time again through his long career . 
  there is a good argument to be made that he was the single most influential person to have ever lived . 
  mexico , pakistan , india , china , etc. 
  are all net-good exporters today . 
  in the first three the core-work itself was done directly by borlaug , in china it was done by chinese government officers who were purposely copying borlaug 's work . 
  as a percentage of the human population , there are fewer people starving today than at any point other in human history . 
  that 's because of norman borlaug . 
  for others here , who i am sure would like more facts , i will drop the following informational links about gmos in general here : * [ the gmo controversy ] ( http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-gmo-controversy/ ) * [ persistent anti-gmo myths ] ( http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/persistent-anti-gmo-myths/ ) * [ 8 lies about gmos ] ( http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/8-lies-about-gmos/ ) * [ should there be mandatory gmo labeling ? 
  ] ( http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/should-there-be-mandatory-gmo-labeling/ ) * [ gmo facts and fiction ] ( https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4454 ) * [ genetically modified organisms : jeopardy or jackpot ? 
  ] ( https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4112 ) each of these articles themselves contain further link-citations to more supporting evidence . 
  lastly , once again to restate my original thesis : borlaug supported gmos . 
  pinochet was in power during the war . 
  well , a good number of the longer ones are mine . 
  and i use longer titles cause that has always been my preference . 
  i do n't know ... 
  but i would guess i am currently responsible for about 10-20 % of the links submitted to r/europe . 
  i hit lots of european news organizations though . 
  i 'll take a look around and see what else i find out there . 
  but i am a political junkie . 
  i 'm a mod over in r/politics and r/worldnews and a lot of other places too . 
  ( r/technology , r/scifi , r/history , r/health , r/help , r/modhelp , r/apple probably being the majors . ),
