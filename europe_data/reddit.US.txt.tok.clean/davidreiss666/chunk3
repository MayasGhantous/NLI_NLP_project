  any sort of special requests you would like to give me while i 'm making my daily rounds ? 
  if you need anything from me , just ask . 
   he did not create a hellenic empire actually , yes . 
  alexander did create the great big greek empire that stretched from epirus to india . 
  and it collapsed into lots of pieces , some big , some small , after his death . 
  but it helped to spread greek hellenic culture into north africa , the middle east , central asia and western india . 
  alexander rightly gets the credit for much of that . 
   and african americans are making an equally ridiculous case in the book black athenians . 
  and arguing that cleopatra was black . 
  well , the name of the book is not `` black athenians '' . 
  it is [ black athena ] ( http://www.google.com/search?q=black+athenians&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;client=firefox-a#hl=en&amp;sugexp=ldymls&amp;pq=black%20athenians&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=black%20athena&amp;cp=10&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=bb&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us%3aofficial&amp;source=hp&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=black+athe&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=88bea1bcf80a26ed&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1077 ) . 
  and yes , it does try and claim that cleopatra was black . 
  and , in my capacity as the primary mod of r/history , i 'll even denounce it here and now as pseudo-historical trash . 
  but the book was addressing the ptolemaic egyptian kingdom and africa in general there . 
  it was not talking about greece proper . 
  but yes , it is a bunch of bs . 
  somebody should file a formal complaint with the danes over the name of greenland . 
  i mean , it ai n't green . 
  i think the international criminal court needs to be involved there . 
  okay . 
  i 've held off on making my snide comment . 
  but here goes . 
  come , join the eu -- we need help with the preparations for the break-up party . 
  those threshold limits you 're talking about are for individuals though . 
  not government orders . 
  i am not even positive if those things officially apply to large companies . 
  what kind of safeguards could you have in place ? 
  threat of force ? 
  german , french and other troops standing at the ready ? 
  and let 's face it , who cares about greece ? 
  what happens if italy or spain pulls something ? 
  is that not the real worry ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's a secret swiss plot to take over europe . 
  is n't it ? 
  :-) is n't this the issue with the euro entirely . 
  do n't let in people you do n't trust . 
  and do n't trust people who might do something really stupid . 
  it 's like the the whole issue with the secret club when you were eight ... only writ large on an international stage . 
  germany and france and the others would need to walk away very quickly . 
  the reality of the situation is the euro would break apart in an afternoon . 
  which in international politics is pretty damn fast . 
  i see that happening through something other than the eu though . 
  that 's where i look toward the g20 . 
  purely as an aside , one of the lesser titles of the holy roman emperors was `` king of the germans '' . 
  sort of in the same way that one of the queen of england 's lesser titles is `` lord of mann '' ( in reference to the isle of man ) . 
  you repeated a comment . 
  this is even more of an open secret than the whole `` israel is a nuclear power '' open secret . 
  really , are there people who think nato is just a book club ? 
  if you think that in today 's world there is endless military spending , you might want to look into pre-ww2 era . 
  where the size of the british , french , and german military programs was on the order of 4-5 times the current us military . 
  and those were nations that are roughly the equivalent of current canada . 
  is that the world you want ? 
  cause if so , then there will be 40-50 nations each with similar sized militarys to those of the pre-ww2 era . 
  all it would take is political will on their part . 
  nato , the eu , nafta , the un , and other like organizations are working properly . 
  the eu is only possible because nato exists ... heck , nato now all-but-acts as the eu 's official military branch . 
  could things be better ? 
  of course . 
  but that is always true . 
  there is always room for improvement . 
  that is the question : is the threat gone ? 
  if you disband does the threat come back ? 
  the problem with turkey entering the eu is going to be much more a sociopolitical question than any real issue to do with turkey . 
  though , there are some real economic issues with regard to turkey . 
  but most europeans are going to view turkey as mostly non-european in nature ... if just because the small strip of europe they do own is very small , and -- of course -- the religion issue . 
  lots of europeans may not be full-on christians , but when they are n't they are non-practicing christians ( or maybe ex-christians ) of some kind . 
  and getting their heads around muslim members of the eu is a tad sociopolitically difficult . 
  basically , a different cultural mind-set . 
  it will take years for them to get used to the idea . 
  so , that is why most observers put turkish ascension to the eu 20 + years out . 
  as to the real economic issues . 
  they are manageable as long as turkey improves their economy . 
  it will take time , but as it gets better ... well , that will go a long way toward lessening the sociological issues discussed above . 
  all in all , i think turkish membership in the eu will probably be a good thing .
