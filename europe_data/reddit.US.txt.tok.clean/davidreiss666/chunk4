  ## what is the sidebar ? 
  * the [ `` sidebar '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ovtmd4k.png ) is the list of information pertaining to a specific subreddit . 
  at the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit . 
  it also contains the link to `` subscribe/unsubscribe '' from that subreddit . 
  underneath that it generally lists the rules , guidelines , relevant information , similar subreddits , etc. 
  ** note : ** many mobile reddit apps require you to press a certain button for the sidebar to show up . 
  every subreddit has a sidebar . 
  please do n't forget to look for it even if your app does n't immediately show it !, 
  [ here 's an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0 ) * you should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit , and if you do n't understand a rule message the moderators to ask . 
  this ensures that your post stays on the subreddit , as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed . 
  * have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit ? 
  ask the moderators there !, 
  [ here 's an image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/asq0zho.png ) that shows you where you can typically find the link to message the mods . 
  -- ## who are moderators ? 
  what do they do ? 
  * each subreddit is a community with its own focus . 
  the mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules . 
  for example , / r/android is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the android operating system . 
  anything not directly related to android is removed by its moderators . 
  similarly , / r/apple is a subreddit dedicated to discussing apple and its products . 
  * moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to * only the subreddits they moderate . 
  * they can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit . 
  moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar , so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good !, 
  ## who are admins ? 
  what do they do ? 
  * [ meet the admins . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/about/team ) the admins are like super-moderators . 
  they have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more . 
  they are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users . 
  * the admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits , letting the moderators and the community decide how its run . 
  ** however , ** the admins will enforce the [ rules of reddit ] ( http://www.reddit.com/rules ) on every subreddit . 
  be familiar with these rules . 
  failure to follow these rules may earn you a ** sitewide ban ** , or the closing down of a subreddit . 
  -- ## what is reddiquette ? 
  * [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) is an ** informal ** set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit . 
  as reddit has grown , certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged . 
  reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you are n't left wondering why your posts are n't well-received . 
  you might not be banned not following reddiquette , but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you do n't . 
  -- ## help !, 
  what happened to my post ? 
  * reddit is a huge forum with millions of users . 
  many posts are made here every day . 
  many , many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users . 
  other posts just do n't fit the subreddit . 
  moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility . 
  some moderators use bots to help them report posts , some moderators do it all themselves . 
  every subreddit is different . 
  if you find your post not showing up in the subreddit , your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it 's not showing up . 
  * please note : when you message the moderators , all moderators can read it !, 
  it 's a shared inbox !, 
  * * * i can still see my post but others say they ca n't ? 
  * nothing is really removed from reddit , if a mod removes something it is de-listed for others to see . 
  you can still see it with a direct link . 
  * * my post was removed because it was spam ? 
  what gives ? 
  * spam is a tricky subject , reddit has several base rules but much of it is left for moderators to decide . 
  reddit 's [ faq ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq ) has a good section explaining it . 
  -- ## i have a great idea for a subreddit !, 
  * awesome !, 
  [ message the moderators ] ( http://i.imgur.com/asq0zho.png ) so you can talk to them ## i have a great idea for reddit as a site !, 
  * awesome too !, 
  post it in / r/ideasfortheadmins ## what if i do n't like the moderators or how the subreddit is run ? 
  * that 's okay , reddit was built to handle just that !, 
  first though , make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there are n't any misunderstandings , or if you ca n't just compromise . 
  otherwise , make your own community !, 
  [ here is an excellent guide ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101 ) for starting and moderating your own subreddit . 
  * moderators are people , too , so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns . 
  we care about the communities we help run and would hate to see users leave because of something that we can help fix !, 
  -- ## what if i need help with something else ? 
  * try / r/help for general help on reddit . 
  / r/askmoderators can also help you out if you need to ask mods about anything .
