apparently not with great success . 
   yet we are on reddit where `` flair '' has a very specific meaning . 
  no one gives a shit what the original application for it is . 
  it 's very difficult for a supreme court justice to get fired . 
  in fact , i do n't think that 's ever happened in all of america 's history . 
  but who else , besides the government , would appoint a supreme court justice ? 
  that 's what i 'm not getting . 
  are they voted in directly ? 
  so who appoints the judges ? 
  who decides whether an assessor becomes a judge ? 
   we 're talking about 2 toddlers thinking they can take on a bulldozer because they they can wave a stick around well body armor and years of training wo n't make you invulnerable to bullets and ieds . 
  again , i think the iraq war , and the war in afghanistan ( with both the u.s. in the 2000s and russia in the 1970s ) are instructive . 
  good planning and resourcefulness can make a larger , more powerful army retreat or reassess their goals . 
  how does the system work in europe ? 
   if this can suddenly become legal with a warrant why ca n't it become legal without a warrant sometimes in the future ? 
  or just making warrants very easy to obtain ? 
  the concept of requiring a warrant to arrest and detain people has existed for hundreds of years . 
  it 's ridiculous to say , `` sure , we can do x and y with a warrant , but what if the government decides that a warrant is n't necessary ? '', 
  the whole point of a warrant is a check and balance against government power , and it 's been working pretty well for the past several centuries . 
   that 's like saying the 1st amendment is n't needed if people know how to speak anonymously . 
  or the 2nd is n't needed if people know how to hide their guns if the government wanted to take them . 
  first name : `` john smith ; select * from database '' that 's an example of an sql attack . 
  copy and paste it into a web form , and it may possibly display a bunch of private data . 
  anybody can do it , but it 's easy to defend against . 
  in fact , if a computer administrator did his job * properly * , then hacks like that would n't be possible . 
  what the cia is doing is essentially finding ways in which computer administrators are n't doing their jobs well , and using that to collect info for national security purposes . 
  and quite frankly , i think it should be legal for private citizens to do that as well . 
  there is no reason why i should be sent to jail for typing in text into a search bar that magically breaks a site ,, 
  analogy : if someone much , much stronger than you or i is trying to rape one of us , then fighting back with all our might will likely make him give up . 
  same scenario with an insurgency vs a state-sponsored military . 
  you just got ta make it not worth their time to take away your freedoms . 
  what 's so confusing ? 
  when judges die , they need to be replaced . 
  it 's the president 's and congress 's job to replace them . 
  president trump and the republican congress replaced one judge that died during the obama administration , and they 'll likely replace two or 3 more judges that are currently in their 80s . 
  and `` prosecutors '' are not `` judges '' . 
  just like you and i have the right to pick our defense attorneys when we 're accused of a crime , the president has the right to pick his attorneys when he wants to make a case to the judicial branch . 
  it 's really not a big deal . 
  this is why there is such a backlash against the u.s. media nowadays . 
  they 're making a mountain out of a molehill , and causing people to panic over a bunch of fake controversies . 
  `` attacking '' . 
  you use the word `` attacking '' . 
  try using the word `` criticizing '' , and you might start to realize how ridiculous it is to compare trump to a dictator . 
   back in the day a well armed populace could successfully fight but today it stands no chance against the biggest most advanced army on earth . 
  iraqi insurgents warded off american forces pretty well . 
  the situation is much more complicated than it seems ; just getting a superior force to say , `` fuck it , it 's not worth it '' after killing off half of an opposing army can be a victory under certain circumstances . 
   what i 'm saying is that the us has definitely lost some of its freedoms and it looks like it will lose more in the future and this has produced no reaction from the people . 
  most of the examples you listed apply primarily to foreign adversaries , and can not be used against u.s. citizens without a warrant . 
  and they affect less than 0.001 % of america 's population . 
  and you listed things that many hackers can do without government help , and things that people wo n't have to worry about if they protect their privacy properly . 
  you 're exaggerating the problem , in other words . 
  i presume that english is n't your first language ? 
  [ here 's a little bit of context on what people generally think of when they see the word `` flair '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_chqk8j6so8 ) . 
  i 've visited one of the concentration camps in bavaria , i know germany still has the equipment needed to re-enact their anti-semitism . 
  please keep your gas chambers turned off . 
  i do n't know how things work in europe , but here in the u.s. , the president resembles a pawn more than a king . 
  congress and the judiciary have equal , if not more , power than the president . 
  and then you have the 2nd amendment right to bear arms , which is like a 4th branch of government . 
  no dictatorship . 
  none at all . 
   it is . 
  the only good thing about trump is that he 's too old and too incompetent to be a successful dictator . 
  ... sigh ... 
  if average schoolyard bullies routinely push americans to commit mass murder with fully automatic weapons , what makes you think we would allow a dictator to rule us ? 
   resources are not infinite that 's why capitalism works so well . 
  crosspost to / r/dataisbeautiful please . 
  hundreds of little boy/fat man-level nukes similar to what the u.s. dropped in japan will barely make a scratch . 
  they could level rhode island at best . 
  what allies would china have that has nuclear weapons ? 
  they 're not part of the warsaw pact ( i just checked ) . 
  what about calling someone a fascist or comparing them to hitler ? 
  and if someone genuinely believes that trump is comparable to hitler , then what if someone genuinely believes that merkel is insane and a criminal ? 
  i 'll happily stick with the u.s. 's 1st amendment . 
  ... and the u.s. media condemned trump for wanting to `` open up defamation laws '' when the u.s. 's defamation laws would n't touch that case with a 20 foot pole . 
  last i checked , china does n't have many megaton-level weapons . 
  so we 're talking about a death toll of a few million on america 's end after our missile defense shield knocks down a few of them , and then a billion deaths on china 's end . 
  china has a few hundred nukes . 
  the u.s. has thousands , if not tens of thousands . 
  we would dominate them . 
   and most importantly they clearly point out these differences for anyone who bothers to read the text itself , not just glimpse at the little gif . 
  well , the issue is that these `` fact-checks '' are usually combined together , quickly summarized , and spread out to the general public without closer scrutiny . 
  for instance , the new york times ( from america ) has [ made a chart ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/opinion/campaign-stops/all-politicians-lie-some-lie-more-than-others.html?_r=0 ) declaring [ what percentage of each candidate 's statements are lies ] ( https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/11/sunday-review/falsehood-face-off-1449782195629/falsehood-face-off-1449782195629-facebookjumbo-v2.png ) . 
  nobody is going to go through each individual statement in that infographic to double check the accuracy . 
  people have just assumed that the infographic is unbiased , and that certain candidates are liars . 
   however i do stick by my argument that these leanings in nuancing details are nowhere near to be the major focus of any state-established fact-checker . 
  they aim to fight blatant lies constructed to rile up already miserable and poorly informed people who are n't the type to go researching particular politicians ' random arguments on technical details on topics of tertirary importance . 
  have you considered that a state-established fact-checker would actually just be politician-established fact-checker , and that the politicians are primarily concerned about re-election and not the full truth ? 
   i asked you to show instances when fact-checkers were found to be lie , not when they provided context on multifaceted issues and made arguments you morally disagreed with here , let me hop in . 
  snopes.com cited a non-existent author from a non-existent magazine in order to debunk the fact that we eat 8 spiders a day .

  politifact.com has stated that the * same exact fact * is [ false when america 's president-elect donald trump says it ] ( http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/jun/20/donald-trump/trump-misleadingly-puts-black-youth-unemployment-r/ ) , but [ true when former candidate bernie sanders says it ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/13/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-real-unemployment-rate-african/ ) . 
  nbc news fact-checked [ trump 's statement that hillary clinton got rid of subpoenaed , court-requested e-mails by `` acid washing the server '' . 
  she actually got rid of the subpoenaed , court-requested e-mails by using an application called `` bleach bit '' ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/card/trump-said-clinton-acid-washed-server-nope-n663436 ) that effectively acid-washed the server . 
  a distinction without a difference . 
  they were just * looking * for a reason to call donald trump wrong . 
  [ here are 8 examples of biased fact-checking during america 's 2016 election ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/26/eight-examples-where-fact-checking-became-opinion-/ ) , and [ and here are a half-dozen other examples of biased fact-checking during america 's 2012 elections ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10000872396390444301704577631470493495792 ) . 
  the fundamental problem here is that you see truth as a simple black-and-white issue , when truth itself is filled with grey areas . 
  innocent people are often found guilty in the court of law , experts sometimes say wrong things to the public , scientific models are bound to be proven wrong over time , and many facts and assertions are entirely dependent upon one 's worldview or perspective ( i.e. 
  `` is australia upside-down , or are we ? '' ) .
