  * notice how there is no future tense form of the verb * to walk * . 
  the future tense always requires an extra word . 
  it 's for this reason that we say english verbs only have two tenses . 
  that does n't mean that english can not express more than two tenses , but rather that the verbs on their own can not do this . 
  they require auxiliary verbs . 
  on one hand this makes conjugating english verbs relatively straightforward , but the [ sheer number of auxiliary verb combinations ] ( https://i.stack.imgur.com/7fbro.jpg ) used to express tenses in english can make verb usage extremely complex . 
  english has a lot of silent letters too . 
  what 's complicated about remembering that * kernel * and * colonel * are homophones ? 
  fortunately english is very tolerant of pronunciation variations so most people could probably figure out what you 're trying to say from context . 
  as a native english speaker i never realized this until i started learning other languages . 
  english has very few gendered nouns . 
  it only has two tenses ( past and present ) . 
  there 's no formal pronouns . 
  conjugation of regular verbs is pretty straightforward . 
  we do try to make up for it with the non-standard spelling though . 
   short and long sounds are a mistery . 
  sheet and shit might as well be the same word . 
  we would always get a good chuckle when our spanish teacher would talk about the beach and it came out sounding like ` bitch ' . 
   estonian has four tenses ( no future tense ) while english has around twelve . 
  linguistically speaking , english only has two tenses . 
  using the verb ` to work ' as an example , the tenses are past ( i worked ) and present ( i work ) . 
  if you want to express future tense in english you have to add modal verbs . 
  for example to express future perfect you have to say : `` he ** will have worked ** by the time we arrive . '', 
  same in english . 
  it 's actually kind of interesting when you look into the reasons behind the stereotypical accents of other languages . 
  for example the stereotypical italian accent in english adds vowel sounds to the end of words . 
  this is because almost all italian words end with a vowel sound . 
  another thing i noticed with spanish speakers is that they will add an ` e ' sound to the beginning of english words that begin with 's ' followed by a consonant . 
  so stupid becomes estupid , start becomes estart , street becomes estreet , etc. 
  this is because spanish words that begin with 's ' are almost always followed by a vowel . 
  heh , no they do n't rhyme . 
  some words that rhyme with ** food ** : rude , nude , crude , brewed , sued , lewd , prude some words that rhyme with ** wood ** : hood , good , could , should , would , stood, 
  blame the french and the great vowel shift . 
  fortunately new words that enter into english are mostly standardized , although we still insist on not anglicizing the spelling of loanwords . 
  the one place you would not use contractions in english is in formal writing . 
   england , scotland , wales , and northern ireland are countries , britain is not . 
  they 're all countries . 
  britain ( or the uk if you prefer ) is a sovereign country that is made up of four constituent countries . 
  it is a country of countries . 
   first of all britain is not a country of course it is . 
  what else would it be ? 
  it 's important for things like citizenship . 
  my great grandfather was italian and because of that i can be recognized as an italian citizen , even though nobody in my family speaks italian or has set foot in italy in over 100 years . 
  it 's easier for me to get an italian passport than it is for someone with non-italian parents who was born and raised in italy simply because i have an italian citizen in my ancestral line . 
  meanwhile in the us all you have to do is be born here and you automatically get citizenship . 
  it does n't matter what your ancestry is . 
  identity politics is more related to race ( among other things ) which is not the same thing as ancestry . 
   i 'm not as obsessed with it as the yanks are ; but i 'm not as violently allergic to it as the euros are . 
  here is the difference between how americans and europeans think of ancestry : to americans ancestry is interesting but not important . 
  to europeans ancestry is important but not interesting . 
  for americans our ancestry can be an interesting hobby but it has no effect on our daily lives . 
  in europe your ancestry is a core part of citizenship and national identity . 
  the vibe i 've gotten from italians is that they think americans romanticize the mafia too much . 
  i like the idea behind monarchy . 
  it 's a symbol of continuity . 
  it can focus better on solving problems and making preparations for things that have a long term payoff . 
  it 's less susceptible to fear mongering and emotional manipulation . 
  democracy is way too shortsighted . 
  also the masses are stupid . 
  brexit is the poster child for why impactful , far-reaching national decisions probably should n't be decided by popular vote . 
  the big downside to monarchy of course is that you can end up with a really crappy monarch . 
  i think aluminum pans are much more common here than cast iron . 
  in general most households have a mix of aluminum , cast iron , and non-stick . 
  [ culdesac in english . 
  ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/pronunciation/english/cul-de-sac ), 
  english also tends to ignore the singular/plural rules in italian when borrowing words . 
  for example in italian * panini * is plural but in english it 's singular . 
  the plural in english would be * paninis * . 
  there are a * lot * of italian loanwords in english . 
  a large portion tend to be related to art , music , or food . 
  english has a [ bazillion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/outline_of_german_expressions_in_english ) german loanwords but * schadenfreude * is my favorite . 
  i feel like that 's not super common though . 
  that salute predates the nazis by many decades . 
  the author of the pledge of allegiance first described it in the 1890s . 
  [ here are some kids using it in 1915 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/bellamy_salute_1915.jpg/1920px-bellamy_salute_1915.jpg ) , several years before the nazi party was founded . 
  decades later hitler adopted what came to be known as the nazi salute because he assumed ( wrongly ) that it was an ancient roman military custom . 
  because the salute became associated with the nazis , congress eventually passed a law that changed the salute to a hand-over-the-heart gesture which is what is used today . 
   no wonder you guys managed to elect an authoritarian president . 
  you 're really bad at spotting stuff like that ... 
  the pledge is over 100 years old , so not exactly a harbinger of authoritarianism . 
  it 's against the law to force someone to say the pledge or punish a person for not saying it . 
  there was a [ supreme court case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_virginia_state_board_of_education_v._barnette ) about it . 
  perhaps , but most of us do n't give a shit about the pledge . 
   i might be wrong , but from what i read online americans seem to have more distrust in their government than any other people . 
  that 's why you 'll often get some eyerolling from americans when we hear non-americans call the pledge creepy . 
  the pledge has such little meaning to most of us and it does n't really carry the connotations it might in europe . 
  the pledge does n't really have the kind of baggage for us that it might in germany . 
  sort of like how the nazi flag is sometimes casually used in asian countries . 
  americans do n't really think about it that way . 
  plus almost nobody says the pledge past elementary school . 
  those are newsworthy because they 're exceptional . 
  we do n't have freedom of movement but there are things like nafta that make it easier for americans to live and work in canada . 
   beach and bitch is another one . 
   my colombian spanish teacher always pronounced beach like ` bitch ' . 
  we always found that hilarious . 
   american media makes them look really popular they 're not uncommon but i would n't say they 're popular . 
  the average american does n't go to strip clubs . 
  there 's a social stigma against them and they 're largely seen as trashy so they 're often located in poorer parts of town . 
  a redo election because people based their vote on current events ? 
  i do n't think so .
