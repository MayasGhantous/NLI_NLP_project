  like it or not , trump legitimately won . 
  irrelevant . 
  he won because he got to 270 electoral votes . 
  that 's all that matters . 
  how is that different ? 
  that 's stupid . 
  a president 's policies have nothing to do with his legitimacy . 
  heh , to us you are . 
  in the us the vast majority of our italian immigrants came from southern italy so that 's what we think of when we think of italians . 
  the stereotype endures : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc8tfiookvu, 
  we 're loud in general , not just when we 're tourists . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i 've heard in the past that people who did n't grow up eating hershey 's chocolate bars tend to think they taste bad but this is the first time i 've seen them described as `` literally tasting like vomit '' . 
  hershey 's is pretty low quality though and is seen as sort of the `` mcdonald 's of chocolate '' , even among americans . 
  we do have some high quality brands but they 're not as widely available and are more expensive . 
  we 're not exactly known for our chocolate making or candy in general . 
  that 's a loaded question ( no pun intended ) . 
   germany has a base in the usa . 
  is it an actual german base or is it german facilities on a us base ? 
  ugh , it 's spreading . 
  i had no idea this has become a thing outside the united states . 
   what does it do that only benefits american interests ? 
  it serves american interests but it does n't * only * serve american interests . 
  right , i 'm just saying that english verbs have no future tense . 
  just present and past . 
  this is my personal observation . 
  i do n't think eu countries or the us seem richer . 
  i think each offers a different lifestyle . 
  americans tend to be more optimistic and comfortable with risk so there are a lot more opportunities for success here . 
  i 'm a software engineer and i 'm easily making double or triple what i 'd be making most places in europe , and i do n't even live in a high cost of living area by us standards . 
  things i want to buy are cheaper and my taxes are lower . 
  i also have excellent health insurance . 
  of course that also means there 's more opportunities for failure . 
  there 's a social safety net but it has a lot of holes . 
  if you fail hard you 're more or less on your own . 
  on the flip side europeans appear to value stability . 
  while there 's less risk taking and opportunity , in exchange there 's an emphasis in a minimum quality of life . 
  things are more expensive and houses are smaller but there 's a lot of great social services . 
   their terrible healthcare and university system these things are expensive but are far from terrible . 
  people from all over the world come to our universities . 
  hmm , let 's see . 
  the us does n't have low literacy levels or a high rate of population growth . 
  our health care is expensive but certainly not poor . 
  public transit could be more extensive but the infrastructure is not third world by any means . 
  yeah , a loose cannon is n't necessarily crazy , just unpredictable in a negative way . 
  they 're similar but have different meanings so are often not interchangeable . 
  i do n't either but apparently we have a word for it . 
  technically english verbs do n't have a future tense either . 
  you have to add auxiliary verbs to express the future , although they are not time specific . 
  `` i study '' ( present ) vs i ** will ** study '' ( future ) . 
  kind of like in english how we have * niece/nephew * and * aunt/uncle * but no word to refer to either of them collectively or in a gender neutral way . 
  last week christmas wreaths had been put up at the train station i use to commute to work . 
  earliest i 've seen it yet . 
  i quite like scottish accents . 
  i 've heard of that word but its usage seems to be mostly colloquial . 
  yeah , i get what you 're saying . 
  just wanted to point out that we do actually have a word for `` 24 hours '' . 
  `` i slept the whole day '' implies you slept sunrise to sunset . 
  `` i slept a whole day '' or `` i slept for a day '' implies you slept for 24 hours . 
  depending on context * day * can mean 24 hours or just daytime . 
   i often hear professionals ( maybe even weather presenters ? ), 
  say `` subzero temperatures '' . 
  since celsius is n't commonly used in the us we will usually hear the weather guy say `` freezing temperatures '' . 
  is that kind of like a [ callback ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/callback_%28telecommunications%29 ) ? 
  something i noticed about english is that there are gendered nouns for parents ( mother/father ) , children ( son/daughter ) , siblings ( brother/sister ) , etc. 
  but there 's no word for `` female cousin '' or `` male cousin '' . 
  there 's also no word to refer to `` nieces and nephews '' or `` aunt and uncle '' collectively . 
  you 're fine . 
  it 's okay to use male and female in the context of language . 
  it 's perfectly fine to use male and female in the context of language . 
   the much simpler word that i miss in english often is `` para '' ( day + night , 24 hours ) . 
  that 's literally what the word * day * means . 
  if you said `` i have n't slept for a day '' i would take that to mean you have n't slept for the last 24 hours . 
  the english word for that is * smegma * . 
  in english we have two ways to express love for someone : ** `` i 'm in love with you . 
  '' ** and ** `` i love you . 
  '' ** the first always implies romantic love and you would only say it to your boyfriend/girlfriend or spouse . 
  the second can be used for anyone you care about deeply ( i.e. 
  your family ) but can also mean romantic love , so there 's some overlap . 
  the first is also not said very often so you would n't use it on a casual basis . 
  we would usually say * freezing * . 
  frost is technically correct but it 's more commonly used to describe a thin layer of ice . 
   pakkanen : temperature that 's colder than 0 \u00b0 celsius in english we would call that * freezing * or * frost * , although frost is mostly used to describe a thin layer of ice rather than temperature . 
   anteayer : the day before yesterday . 
  we used to have * ereyesterday * but it 's incredibly archaic . 
  we use * apartheid * in english too , but usually only in the context of south africa . 
  in the us we would refer to it as segregation . 
  household implies that everyone is living under the same roof . 
  you can have immediate family that are not part of your household . 
  i agree that * lust * in english does n't have to imply anything sexual but earthporn is a bad example because it 's a play on the sexual meaning of * lust * and it also is n't a real word . 
   english lust implies sexuality not always . 
  it 's also commonly used to mean a deep longing for something . 
  if you said , `` john has a lust for power , '' there is no implied sexual meaning there . 
  the english * lust * also does not have to be sexual . 
  not always . 
  demonyms like iraqi , icelander , israeli , kuwaiti , slovak , turk , etc can be used the same as german or italian . 
  not all females are women though . 
  but yeah , female sounds more clinical and academic . 
  it 's commonly used in some circles though , like the military . 
  * spaniard * is also easier because you can say `` i am a spaniard '' instead of `` i am a spanish person . '',
