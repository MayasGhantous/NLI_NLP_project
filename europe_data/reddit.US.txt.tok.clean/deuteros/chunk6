   from atlanta : mexico , central america , cuba , the caribbean and canada are all closer than that ( by air ) and all very expensive . 
  it 's generally much cheaper to fly from atlanta to san francisco than it is to fly from atlanta to a much closer international destination . 
   for a middle age person , is $ 1000 for an all inclusive trip to mexico does that include airfare ? 
  where i live a round trip flight to mexico can easily cost $ 400 - $ 1000 . 
   really that expensive ? 
  perhaps not , but it would be for a younger person . 
   abut 2 million trips from sweden to spain each year , the distance from sweden to spain is about the same as the distance between atlanta and phoenix . 
  you can travel a long way and still not leave the country . 
   that 's 20 % of the population . 
  roughly 20 % of americans travelled internationally in 2016 , so it 's not like none of us are doing it . 
  but because the us is so big and international travel is more expensive there 's far less incentive to leave the country . 
  we also get less time off so that may also be a factor . 
  i 'm an american who does not enjoy small talk with strangers . 
  it 's never happened to me either , but i 'm not the type of person who voluntarily talks with strangers so that could be part of it . 
  it 's not unusual . 
  international travel is expensive from the us . 
  you can fly from the uk to italy for $ 50 but if i wanted to fly somewhere `` close '' like canada i 'd probably have to pay over $ 400 unless i tried to hold out for a really good deal . 
  i could go by car ( which i 've done once ) but the closest international border is an 11 hour drive away . 
  a drive like that in europe would take you through several countries . 
  also the us is such a huge country . 
  i could get on a plane and fly 6 hours in one direction and still be over american soil . 
  there 's so much to do here that there 's less incentive to pay the extra money to travel internationally . 
  it 's generally not to make friends . 
  i think sunday being the first day of the week is an anglosphere thing . 
  it 's from the resurrection . 
  early christians sometimes referred to it as the `` eighth day '' . 
  english has a bunch of auto-antonyms . 
  these are words that have more than one meaning where one of the meanings is the opposite of one of the other meanings . 
  for example : ** sanction ** - can mean * approval * ( `` i received his sanction to continue my research '' ) but it can also mean * to penalize * ( `` the us will sanction russia '' ) . 
  ** off ** - usually means * inactive * or * not currently functioning * ( `` the computer is off '' ) but it can also mean * on * or * activated * ( `` the alarm has been going off for the last 10 minutes '' ) . 
  there 's nowhere in europe that only gets 12 hours of sunlight in the summer . 
  i live in atlanta which is farther south than anywhere in europe and we still get over 14 hours of sunlight during the summer . 
  times square is a tourist attraction . 
  i do n't think it 's popular with new york natives . 
  that looks awesome . 
  birthright citizenship also makes it easier to integrate into american society . 
  you do n't end up with multiple generations of people who are born and live in the country and do n't have citizenship . 
   your hs is piss easy with a lot less workload . 
  that 's why you guys do one extra year of university for undergrad . 
  high school has nothing to do with how long it takes to get a degree at an american university . 
  most american universities have a liberal arts curriculum which exposes students to a broad range of subjects outside their concentration . 
  most european universities do not have a liberal arts curriculum and have a completely different academic structure . 
  we have grits which is similar to polenta . 
  did you buy bread from the bakery or the bread aisle ? 
  there 's a huge difference in quality . 
  weird . 
  i 've never heard of `` russian tea '' . 
  that 's a swedish pancake . 
  there 's a gazillion different kinds of pancakes . 
  americans generally would n't confuse mexican food with spanish food . 
  spanish food is actually pretty rare here , at least where i live . 
  to be fair , hershey 's is probably our shittiest chocolate . 
  i do n't like pbj sandwiches either . 
  they 're mostly eaten by children . 
  our swiss cheese is nothing like cheddar . 
  i 've never heard of deep fried pizza . 
  maybe it 's a regional thing . 
   fresh bread just is n't a thing here where do you live ? 
  pretty much every grocery store has a bakery inside that makes fresh bread daily . 
  it was maybe 20 years ago . 
  now you can find it in any grocery store . 
  we do have law enforcement at the federal level though . 
  they just do n't have any constitutional authority to enforce state or local laws . 
   because what you have now is a hundred different gangs of thugs operating independently and with very varying levels of oversight . 
  so replace them with one gang of thugs with no oversight ? 
   a single unified police force would be among the first things i 'd propose . 
  why ? 
   how can you protect something that has n't already been granted ? 
  the constitution was heavily influenced by the enlightenment which was big on natural or inherent rights . 
  the idea is that there are certain rights that everyone has by merely existing . 
  some of these rights are explicitly enumerated in the bill of rights . 
   i can see the value of writing that down in american culture , but this question just does n't really translate to my world . 
  it 's important to consider the historical context . 
  the us constitution was primarily an enlightenment document written in a time when the major european powers were ruled by monarchies , and by extension any rights they had were given to them by the monarchs . 
  the anti-federalists were worried that without a codified bill of rights there was little to stop the president from becoming a king and infringing on people 's inherent rights . 
  the english bill of rights which is about 100 years older expresses similar sentiments . 
  contrast this with european constitutions , most of which are less than 100 years old . 
  they were written in a time when democracy was commonplace and democratic ideas were not new , so their authors had different motivations for what they ultimately included and excluded . 
  it 's not a modern interpretation . 
  the militia was n't an official organization . 
  it was simply every able-bodied man . 
  private citizens could own fully armed warships if they wanted . 
  that 's only about 2 % of the population , many of whom do n't even drive . 
  nyc is the exception though . 
  i always thought it was roughly translated as `` oh no !, 
   but this social construct is virtually non existent in germany or austria . 
  the rest of the world is not like germany . 
   but there is not the slightest doubt that we are one species without sub-groups . 
  okay but we are talking about social constructs , not biology . 
  in my area the price of gasoline is $ 0.52 for a liter , which is about # 0.43 . 
   so , how do you see race ? 
  [ it 's complicated . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_and_ethnicity_in_the_united_states )  for me it 's an word for an anachronistic worldview for something that just is n't there . 
  it 's a social construct but that does n't mean it 's not a reality that affects people 's lives . 
  yeah , it seems like a misunderstanding of how other cultures see race . 
  i do n't think nazi stuff has as much of a stigma in asia as it does in the west . 
  the electorate is split up in all sorts of ways , not just by race . 
  i do n't think you understand what you are asking . 
  `` white '' is not an ethnicity .
