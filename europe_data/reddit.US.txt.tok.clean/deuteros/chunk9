  is it the combination of the * r * and * l * sounds that make those words more difficult ? 
  in a general american accent there are a many words with ` r ' that have no vowel sound . 
  some examples : world , hurled , curl , whirl , bird , girl , word , church , birth , burglar , worm , turtle, 
  because we spell it * aluminum * . 
  `` particularly '' is another tough one for some non-native speakers . 
   i 'm pretty sure it 's a name from native american language and maybe frankicised ( is that a word ? 
  the french version of anglicized ? ), 
  during the colonel period . 
  massachusetts was never a french colony so the name is an anglicization . 
  the french called them almouchiquois . 
   the american way is two syllables . 
  in which accent ? 
  the pronunciation i hear most often is * skwirl * which has one syllable and rhymes with whirl . 
  [ that 's probably not true . 
  ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/not_enough_room_to_swing_a_cat#etymology ), 
   but everyone uses the alternative version . 
  i 've only heard the original version . 
  i did n't even know people said it the alternative way . 
  a lot of people are just lazy or hate cooking . 
  i personally love cooking and make everything from scratch when i can . 
   on a side note : i 'm not really an expert but i 'm pretty sure here you ca n't just go and build stuff in or outside your house , even if it 's still your property , but you need an authorization from the local government . 
  that 's mostly true here as well . 
  when we remodeled our kitchen a few years ago we had to get a permit from the city government where we live . 
  when the project was complete we had to have an inspector come and make sure the construction was sound and followed all the building codes . 
   this kinda defeats the purpose of pickup trucks in the first place are there not people who do that sort of thing for a living ? 
  if i hire someone to do some work in my house ( e.g. 
  fix a furnace , install a toilet , replace the roof , etc ) or do some project on my property they 're probably going to need some kind of truck to carry all their equipment . 
  no drive through grocery stores but we do have [ drive through convenience stores ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iynj9dg.jpg ) ( sometimes called a `` brew thru '' ) . 
  they 're not common in my area though . 
  it 's not so easy to leave . 
  especially if you do n't have a college degree or are n't in an in-demand field . 
  you could say the same thing about cured meats and that 's still common . 
  so , like a cake ? 
  weird . 
  never seen one of those before . 
  it 's not actually cheese . 
  just to clarify , that 's not something that is commonly owned . 
  i personally do n't know anyone who has one . 
  work trucks are very common in rural areas . 
  it 's not vegan though . 
  it 's made from cheese . 
  `` plastic cheese '' as you call it is required to be labeled * cheese food * which is legally defined as a product that is made from cheese , rather that being actual cheese . 
  pickups are incredibly useful though . 
  admittedly the larger ones are overkill for most people though . 
  does that matter ? 
  the us has a full presidential system but there is a clear separation of powers between the executive , legislative , and judicial branches . 
  i do n't think parliamentary systems are more immune to those things . 
  also russia is semi-presidential , not presidential . 
  they have a parliament and prime minister that exists alongside the president . 
   that 's a ridiculous stereotype that seems to have been perpetuated by soldiers from the us who visited the uk during wwii when people were being given rationed . 
  that 's not true . 
  the stereotype about british food tasting bad has been around since at least the victorian era and exists in many countries outside the us . 
  that 's because german car companies market themselves as luxury brands here and price their cars that way . 
  they 're more expensive than most american and japanese cars . 
  no , it was taken from the spanish after the spanish-american war . 
  the japanese only occupied it for a couple of years during world war ii . 
  i 've never heard of this tradition . 
  must be a regional thing . 
   meh , i 've seen americans being amazed how most taxis in germany are mercedes . 
  germans usually do n't care that much . 
  put yourself in our shoes . 
  imagine that companies like gm , ford , and chevrolet were perceived as higher end luxury brands in germany . 
  germans visiting the us would see that many of our police cars , taxis , garbage trucks , etc. 
  were `` luxury '' cars when to us they would be nothing special . 
  can you see how that might be interesting to someone ? 
  that scenario is how americans perceive german cars . 
  yeah , * to go * is an irregular verb and a lot of irregular verbs will have additional forms , but the auxiliary verbs are still required . 
  for instance you could n't say `` i gone '' . 
  english does n't have grammatical gender but it does have natural gender and contains a good number of gendered nouns -- probably more than you realize . 
  there 's people specific nouns : boy/girl , man/woman , brother/sister , son/daughter , mother/father , uncle/aunt , nephew/niece . 
  there 's nouns that refer to an occupation : king/queen , emperor/empress , prince/princess , priest/priestess , waiter/waitress , steward/stewardess , actor/actress , host/hostess . 
  then there 's other random gendered nouns : widower/widow , god/goddess , hero/heroine . 
  some types of english contractions are considered acceptable in writing . 
  in formal written english contractions are never used with the one exception of * o'clock * which is always written and spoken as a contraction . 
  * of the clock * is archaic and using it would be an extreme formality . 
  in semi-formal and informal written english it 's acceptable to use contractions like * you 're , you 'll , you 've , i 've , i 'm , we 're , he 's , she 's , do n't , ca n't , wo n't , does n't , was n't , is n't , are n't * , etc. 
  there 's also a category of what are called informal contractions that are very common in spoken english but are almost never acceptable to write out . 
  these include * got ta * ( ` have got to ' ) , * gon na * ( ` going to ' ) , * wan na * ( ` want to ' or ` want a ' ) , * kinda * ( ` kind of ' ) , etc. 
  some others that may or may not be acceptable to write are * ai n't * and * y' all * . 
  formal english is used in things like legal documents , contracts , professional publications , business documents , etc. 
  i 'd say technical documents would also qualify . 
  the one exception to the contraction rule is * o'clock * which is always written out as a contraction . 
  * of the clock * is archaic and virtually never used in conversational or written english . 
  is n't * del * a common contraction for * de el * ? 
  hard to say . 
  when trump becomes president the republicans will control both houses of congress so at this point i feel like the chances of impeachment are low , especially if trump acts as a rubber stamp for whatever agenda they have . 
  right now i 'm betting that many congressional republicans are in `` wait and see '' mode to see how a trump presidency plays out before taking a side . 
  however if trump 's conflicts of interest , recklessness , and friendliness towards russia become too much for the republicans to bear without seriously damaging the party , i can see it happening . 
  it 's worth noting that impeachment just means the president is charged with acting unlawfully . 
  it does n't always result in removal from office . 
  he also has to do something impeachable , so congress ca n't just impeach him because they think he 's a shitty president . 
  he actually has to commit an impeachable offense * while he is president * . 
  there 's actually a constitutional way to remove trump without impeachment . 
  if the vice president and a majority of the executive cabinet declare to congress that the president is unfit for office ( e.g. 
  `` he 's crazy '' ) the vice president will become acting president . 
  congress is then required to meet and if they also decide that the president is unfit then the vice president continues to be acting president . 
  linguists generally only recognize two tenses in english . 
  we do the basic tenses this way : * past : * i * ** walked ** * home . 
  * * present : * i * ** walk ** * home . 
  * * future : * i * ** will walk ** * home .
