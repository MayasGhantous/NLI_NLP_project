   most likely . 
  the usa would need to provide a very strong response or nato , and our other mutual defense treaties , would lose a lot of credibility . 
   lets put it this way : when the us was at war with japan , did they let japanese come into the us and walk freely amongts the population ? 
   oh wait , not they interned even fuckin americans not one of the proudest moments in our country 's history, 
  oh , ok . that makes more sense, 
  army chief of staff gen. george w. casey , jr. stated that `` every guard brigade has deployed to iraq or afghanistan , and over 300,000 guardsmen have deployed in this war . '', 
  so i would n't exactly call them meter maids . 
  although as a reserve component they fill a different role than active duty military . 
  i do n't think the usaf has any other new aircraft to fill the strike fighter role . 
  you can be sure they 're going to make the damn thing work well , no matter how much money they need to plow into it . 
  i do n't know . . we have [ national guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_guard_of_the_united_states ) units that sometimes provide additional security at [ airports ] ( http://dmna.ny.gov/blog/images/1257343362--091103-a-2441b-0024.jpg ) and other public spaces . 
  they can quickly provide additional manpower and equipment to supplement local forces which may not be fully prepared to handle a situation such as this . 
  i 've found them to be very professional , many times more so that the local police force .

  huh til that pump action rifles are a thing . 
  why would you buy one over a semi-auto or bolt action rifle ? 
  you do n't get the variety of rounds like you would with a shotgun , semi-auto will fire more quickly , and bolt-action is cheaper and simpler . 
  the ntsb is responsible for accident investigation , and the fbi is responsible for criminal investigations . 
  sometimes they run parallel investigations ( twa flight 800 ) . 
  other times the ntsb hands over the investigation to the fbi ( [ austin plane crash ] ( http://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/pages/ntsb_transfers_control_of_investigation_of_austin_plane_crash_to_fbi.aspx ) ) . 
  usually the fbi will establish that an intentional act did not lead to a crash and leave the investigation to the ntsb .

  wooooo !!!, 
  well i was totally off ... 
  i split the word up incorrectly and things went downhill from there . 
  i was thinking lita would sound like litany or litigation , and then maybe uen = `` you-in '' ( lita-you-in ) . 
  there are n't many words that end in uen ( less that end with auen ) so i did n't really have much to base that off of . 
  `` lee-town '' makes it much easier to recognize that the ` tau ' is pronounced like the greek letter tau . 
  at that point the pronunciation makes a lot more sense . 
  i 'm still trying to figure out how to pronounce that . 
  kinda like little u.n. ? 
  the end is just a bunch of vowels . 
  wow !, 
  clearly we 're not the only ones who are flag enthusiasts . 
  haha i think as long as people treat the flag with respect it 's ok . also apparently burning us flags [ can be hazardous to your health ] ( http://www.news.com.au/world/how-burning-the-american-flag-can-kill-you-protester-dies-in-pakistan/story-fndir2ev-1226477229229 ) . 
  it 's 255 x 505 ft ( 77 x 153 meters ) and weighs 3000 lbs ( 1360 kg ), 
  fixed, 
  it 's actually a federal law , but in practice it is not enforced . 
  if you 're interested wikipedia has a pretty good article about the [ us flag code ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_flag_code ), 
  i think we may have [ different ] ( https://i.imgur.com/fg0wl9q.jpg ) [ definitions ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ce6ricn.jpg ) of [ flag ] ( https://i.imgur.com/zl6fwyi.jpg ) [ crazy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/hoover_dam_with_large_american_flag.jpg ) . 
  edit : [ one more ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sb0xtia.jpg ) for bear4188, 
  i 'd say the [ us patrols in the south china sea ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/24/us-southchinasea-usa-patrols-china-iduskcn0si04y20151024 ) are a much more important example of standing up to china . 
  i do n't know that anyone here really cares about the dalai lama , but i guess it 's another chance to stick it to china 's leadership . 
  there are some quality comments on that article . 
  it 's cool we still have [ ameristralia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zuyzf9n.jpg ), 
  there 's a relevant story in the news today : [ colorado movie gunman james holmes assaulted by fellow prisoner ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/24/shooting-denver-idusl1n12o05120151024 ) . 
  most likely they will isolate him for the rest of his life . 
  that , or another prisoner will kill him . 
  haha . . 
  i was expecting something closer to [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yfcmlbs.jpg ) . 
  i have 6 rifles and a truck . 
  if that 's not enough i think we can pick up some grenades in sweden . 
  for the love of god can we ban fish from the office microwave ? 
  thanks oba ... dad, 
  in the us most salaried workers are exempt from overtime pay . 
  i could tell my boss to fuck off and stay home on the weekend , but i think i 'd lose my job pretty quickly . 
  baseball is already huge in japan and korea . 
   i have heard that working unpaid overtime is a common thing for salarymen , this is so that they wont get ostracized by their fellow coworkers and superiors . 
  so just like the u.s. then, 
  maybe we should move some bases from germany to poland just in case . 
  canada is our bro . 
  it 's totally different . 
  we 're street smart not book smart . 
  $ 29,010 after tax rebates in the usa . 
  for comparison you can get a ford f-150 for $ 26,540 . 
  yea but have you seen how robe and wizard hat ends ? 
  i do n't blame them for trying it .

  mandarin chinese has the highest number of native speakers , but english has the highest number of total speakers .

  and then when wintertime rolls around , the bats simply freeze to death . 
  ehh . . at this point it 's probably easier to make autocorrect really really good . 
  could you imagine how hard it would be to agree on spelling simplifications ? 
  we ca n't even agree on how words should be spelled in different parts of the world . 
   in the first year , `` s '' will replace the soft `` c '' . 
  sertainly , this will make sivil servants jump for joy . 
  the hard `` c '' will be dropped in favour of the `` k '' , which should klear up some konfusion and allow one key less on keyboards . 
    there will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year , when the troublesome `` ph '' will be replaced with `` f '' , making words like `` fotograf '' 20 % shorter . 
    in the third year , publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible . 
  governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling . 
  also , al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent `` e '' is disgrasful .
