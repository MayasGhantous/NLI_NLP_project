we are expanding our capabilities and cooperation in the pacific theater . 
  our forward deployed military might alone could level most countries naval and air warfighting capabilities .

  speaking with my english friends it seems that the concern is not other eu citizens coming to britain but the loads of economic migrants from poorer countries who come over . 
  they are costing the taxpayers much $ $ and they are making it harder for true asylum seekers to find safety . 
  be careful , someone might call you a racist while you stand up for the rights of women not to be mutilated . 
  will this lead to less people trying to get to europe by boat ? 
  or will it just lead to more extreme measures being taken by would be immigrants ? 
  i was under the impression that french fertility rates were around 1.4, 
  they are just crazy russians . 
  many of them were russian , a ton of first generation americans as well . 
  sounds like my kind of party . 
  i lived in eastern washington state where there is a significant russian population . 
  russian people can either be your best friends or your worst enemies . 
  also it takes time to understand russian culture as they can seem rude and offputting at first . 
  those pesky russians !, 
  awesome !, 
  no right police or anyone getting shot ? 
  must be nice to be able to protest like that . 
  you think you are safe becuase of your culture . 
  when the few people in charge of business in your country see how insane profits are for american corporations they are going to want a piece of that pie . 
  it is only a matter of time until your governments are bought out the way ours has been . 
  see how close acta came to becoming a real thing with only a few lobbying groups in the usa pushing it . 
  now times this by 100 . 
  my concern with this is that european corporations may begin to mimic american corporations . 
  ie , take away special pay , layoff as many people as possible , the creation of a part time work force that is not allowed to work more thatn 28 hours a week at min wage with no benifits , and more . 
  i doubt this . 
  i do n't want to totally doubt the efficiency of the ukrainian military ... but i would expect better performance from the red army . 
  also , its pretty fucked up to celebrate the death of russian soldiers . 
  they are russians , not isis members , they are still human !, 
  we have stuff like this in the states . 
  its fine if they are going because they want to . 
  just because someone opposes unmonitored immigration does not make them a racist . 
  i think that the politically correct term os `` economic refugees '' . 
  an upvote is not an agreemant button . 
  i upvote pwople with totly different viewpoints if they present an intelligent argument . 
  fantastic way to continue the discussion . 
  who are ypu to say incoming migrants want to live off yhe state ? 
  if your coubtry takes in migrants . 
  your country should be willing to put them up and help them get on theor feer onstead of throwing them into ghettos and complaining whne they burn a car or two . 
  wtf are they thinking ? 
  we have such a grand oppurtunity to spread our civilization into space and beyond , yet we still play petty power games with big stakes . 
   within the next few years they are not going to be trading lollipops with russian soldiers . 
  they will be trading ordnance . 
  the domestic militaries must be able to put up a fight , they are fighting/prepping for the defense of their citizens and cities . 
  this is ** not ** acceptable for a power such as germany . 
  the us can not be expected to foot the bill for all of europe 's defenses !, 
  i love nutella , but i can get some at the store . 
  no surrender !, 
  murica forever !!, 
  i see you alot on this board . 
  it does not make you a `` sjw '' to support a basic freedom such as free speech . 
  i am a veteran and i think isis should be bombed into oblivion , but if someone in a free country wishes to freely express their political opinions than that is fine with me . 
  until there is an attack , there is no harm being done by people using their freedom of speech . 
  if they were thought to be linked to the actual terrorist organization then they should be investigated . 
  if they are just some jackasses spewing bs than that is their right . 
  no , but immigration/free speech are large and complex issues that many feel passionate about . 
   they live here and let us pay for their social security ? 
  how are you paying their social security if they are working and paying into the same system you are . 
  with all the immigration of muslims into europe it is now part of european culture to support isis . 
  if enough of your citizens support it , then it becomes a part of your culture . 
  regardless of where their ancestors came from . 
  pretty much . 
  this would happen in america . 
  europeans tend to be more tolerant i think . 
  how is it `` right '' to arrest someone for their political opinions ? 
  they can wave isis flags all damned day , but as long as they are not taking part in the organization or commiting any crimes ; they are just expressing their beliefs . 
  you still ca n't stop people from expressing their beliefs just because their beliefs are terrible . 
  there is now a large population of arabs in europe . 
  guess what . 
  now islam is a part of european culture . 
  they , as citizens , have the same rights you do when it comes to freedom of speech and expression . 
  even if what they are supporting is fucking terrible . 
  who are you to say that promoting the islamic state is anti-european . 
  if european ** citizens ** support it , then it is part of european culture . 
  does not matter if the people in question have ancestory in africa or the middle east . 
  i do n't support their cause . 
  i think they are shitheads . 
  i do support their right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression though . 
  if you ban someone from expressing thier political opinion ( even if they are terrible ) that is repression and it is not ok . 
  why would it get you arrested ? 
  i understand no one likes isis ( fuck those guys for real ) , but at the same time it is a violation of their right to free speech . 
  good point . 
  i should be a citizen in the next few months as long as there are no more silly 's with my paperwork . 
  i 'll check it out . 
  out of curiosity . . what is the job market like for social workers and counselors ? 
  i have considered keeping computers the hobby they are and moving my studies into a more people oriented field . 
  edit : thx guys . 
  awwww yeah !, 
  i have been in process of getting irish citizenship through my grandparents and it was disheartening to hear how shitty the economy/job prospects were over there . 
  it is good to hear things are picking up though , makes me hopeful of maybe working there someday . 
  i am a computer science student and i hear the tech sector is doing pretty swell . 
  nukes are tempting but are not the awnser . 
  you do not want nuclear war to become a normal thing . 
  also , it can quickly escalate into thousands of cities being destroyed and set back our civilization thousands of years . 
  maybe instead of shoving immigrants into ghettos france could take the time to try and educate the migrants they let in . 
  or france could come up with some social programs to help people get out of poverty . 
  if you ca n't do this with immigrants you are letting in , then you have no business allowing it . 
  i understand the historical differences , but i still do n't like the slippery slope that is censorship : - /, 
  any limits on free speech are unacceptable .
