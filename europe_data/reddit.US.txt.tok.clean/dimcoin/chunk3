  banning their speech though is a huge infringement on their rights . 
  the politically correct term is `` economic migrant '' i think . 
  these are good words and all . 
  in the end though , europeans will just continue to use us services until something better and local is created . 
  i might be wrong , i heard it off hand . 
  half the population of sweden emigrated at some time in the past , not sure if it is true . . 
  110,000 people in a year ? 
  i thought sweden had a population of around 4-6 million . 
  how can sweden handle such a load ? 
  that 110,000 figure seems unrealistic . 
  next on the agenda : banning vpn 's for `` national security '' . 
  do n't be sorry for having an opinion and posting an idea . 
  this is / r/europe not nazi germany ... right ... right ? 
  i see alot of people who are very keen on just letting anyone from an impoverished nation enter the continent . 
  my question to them is , would they support a ferry system between africa and europe , or asia and australia . 
  also , would they be willing to pay a voluntary tax to fund said ferry system as well as integration programs from their income . 
  edit : my answer to both of these would be `` no '' . 
  those facts are totally racist bro . 
  i worked for at&t . they gouge on prices and their new `` mobile share '' plan is terrible in how much it overcharges people . 
  they do have fantastic customer service though , if you can get to a tier 2 rep. 
  the teir 1 reps are worthless . 
  verizon is the worst phone company in the states from what i have seen . 
  good coverage , but everything else is terrible . 
  at&t as well as verizon unquestioningly handed over data from what i understand . 
  what fool would trust them in europe not to do the same again ? 
  why was this woman in southern pakistan ... 
  woah , woah , woah . 
  ** i did not say that . 
  ** it still behooves the mexican immigrants to learn english and attempt to integrate . 
  from sources that i have seen on here , immigrants in europe do not attempt to integrate or learn the language . 
  the mexicans in southern california are not very educated , but they work their ass off for under the table money that they often send home . 
  source = 14 years in san diego . 
  people have full university course loads , work full time and have social lives . 
  learning a language would take up less time then a full time university roster . 
  it is just like a rainy version of southern california !, 
  the uk did their part when they committed troops to fighting terrorism and rebuilding in iraq/afghanistan . 
  it is not their responsibility to take care of the people of north africa or the middle east . 
  what about just granting citizenship to the `` travelling people '' in whatever country they were born in and they just settle down like everyone else ? 
  are there still slavers in europe ? 
  i wonder what good russia would gain from trying to intimidate nato countries ? 
  although , i do wonder if we would really do anything if russia decided to obliterate tiblis or some other minor countries capital . 
  russia has so many more nukes than anyone else at the moment . 
  i understand their want to improve missile defense and delivery systems . 
  however , why make more nuclear warheads ? 
  i live on the border canadian/american border . 
  walk less then half a kilometer from the border crossing and you can find areas that are unguarded or have very scant survellence . 
  walk 20 miles ( 32 km ) and you can accidentally walk across the border without knowing it . 
  america in the 1800 's which had an uninhabited ( if we are not counting the natives ... ) `` wild west '' full of resources and opportunity . 
  i hate to use a term i have heard neo nazis use but europe seems `` full '' . 
  as in there are no vast ( we are talking the size of all of western europe ) areas of uninhabited land . 
  you can get black market gasoline ? 
  i bet it is because saunas are awesome . 
  i guess they call it ** `` white pride world wide '' ** for a reason . 
  some of the asylum seekers may be to old to learn german effectively . 
  i see it here with chinese immigrants who come to canada at an old age and are often too old or too busy with family to learn english or french . 
  it sounds like this guy just wants to control his wife though ( which from what i can gather is part of his and her native culture ) . 
   i do n't think you can go by a map of lightpolution to see how much nature 's left . 
  fair enough . 
  wow . 
  is there no wilderness or areas you can drive for 3 + hours without seeing a town/city left in europe ? 
  edit : what i meant to ask was if there were any large swaths of wilderness left ? 
  i still blame england . 
  why is england doing this now ... in 2013 ? 
  is it friday ? 
  i am on vacation and thought it might be sunday . 
  i am doing vacation correctly . 
  the governments of europe are the ones lapping up american policy . 
  edit : i would ** love ** to see a european power stand up to america on such ridiculous issues . 
  well mr. president . 
  that sure was fast ... 
  i was under the impression that the countryside in the north , the northern frontier and also the major city of gao were still battlegrounds ripe with extremist muslim insurgents . 
  almost all of my classmates are surviving/paying using student loans . 
  tuition is expensive in the states and you get to keep any money leftover after paying tuition for personal expenses . 
  i am happy to see france exerting itself . 
  i am against illegal immigration . 
  ( although in the u.s.a. 
  i do support asylum for some mexican workers ... but that 's a totally different issue ) . 
  but , if i were someone fleeing poverty or war in libya i would much rather chill out in southern france , italy , or belgium then seek asylum in neighboring countries located in africa . 
  america will bring the freedom . 
  people worry too much about this . 
  why is the rent so cheap ??? 
  assimilation to the borg is mandatory, 
  those boat crossings seem incredibly dangerous . 
  if they are migrating off the books . 
  would they not be considered illegal immigrants instead of `` migrants '' ? 
  sounds like a government job to me !, 
  aces high by iron maiden . 
  i keep reading on here that germany is an industrial powerhouse . 
  is there a chance at all that other eu nations may want to bolster their manufacturing ? 
  i watched a france24 report a few months ago about how france is continually losing jobs to overseas factories . 
  as an american factory worker who came into work one day and was laid off while being told `` china took our lunch '' by my boss . 
  it seems disheartening to see the eu following the same path the us does . 
  is there any push at all to keep manufacturing in the eu instead of shipping it off continent ? 
  yeah , i can understand that . 
  however , america already has forces in mass in europe . 
  i think that the european countries should maintain their military . 
  but if they let america take a lead in keeping up a military presence , they can spend some of what they would put into their military into fixing their economy . 
  this is what japan did after ww2 . 
  what about doing what japan did for much of the latter part of the 20th century and let the usa take on the role of defender ? 
  take the money you would spend on defense , and invest it back into the economy .
