  despite an enormous tightening of the screw of taxation , it is bringing the finances of the state to the edge of ruin and from this position it is wrecking the bank of issue and its currency . ', 
  hitler 's response was to sack [ schacht ] along with the entire board of directors a few days later , on 20 january 1939 . 
  he no longer fitted into the general national socialist scheme of things , hitler told schacht . 
   unsurprisingly , what schacht and his fellow directors ... had called the ` unrestrained spending habits of the public finances ' continued unabated , at an even more frenetic temp than before . 
  on 15 june 1939 a new law removed all limits on the printing of money , thus realizing schacht 's worst fears . 
  but hitler and nazi leadership did not care . 
  they were counting on the invasion and conquest of eastern europe to cover the costs . 
  in february 1934 hitler had stated that rearmament had to be complete by 1942 . 
  ** by the time of the four-year plan , the date had been moved forward to 1940 . 
  germany 's economic problems , as hitler had always said , could only be definitively solved by war . 
  ** if by flexibility , you mean facing the real inevitability of runaway inflation and long depression , than you 're right . 
  they had that option . 
   hitler 's solution was war in europe to conquer prosperity for germany , rather than let germany suffer under market economic trends no , this was hitler 's plan from the beginning . 
   that is why post war germany did so well , because free trade became the order of the day and germany got access to world markets it had been shut out of by the imperial systems of france , britain , the netherlands , belgium , and japan . 
  this argument could be made , however , for any world economy . 
  however you seem to draw a causal link between this and germany 's ` necessary war ' that is weak at best . 
  and , from another of your comments :  had only the old world order gave germany the free trade it needed to prosper there would have been no need for two world wars and over 100 million combined deaths . 
  again , problematic . 
  you paint the germans as the victim ; they were decidedly not the victim , considering it was german imperialism in the first world war and political philosophy in the second that led to both , rather than ` economic pressures ' as you imply . 
  in the world you are describing , it would have made sense for every great power to go to war all the time to subordinate the others and create the nwo you speak of . 
  however , i am unaware of any other countries starting expansionist wars in europe over the same time period , or even countries that seriously considered the idea . 
  i ask this question from time to time to gauge the person i 'm talking with on reddit , but , in your opinion , did the holocaust happen , and was it a concerted effort by the nazis to rid the world of jews , and was a genocide , and killed 6 million jews in the process ? 
  well , my name is equally a referance to the sword and also the ai from the marathon series *** @@@@ incoming message from durandal@@@@*** a man lit three candles on a certain day each year . 
  each candle held symbolic significance : one was for the time that had passed before he was alive ; one was for the time of the his life ; and one was for time that passed after he had died . 
  each year the man would stare and watch the candles until they had burned out . 
  was the man really watching time go by in any symbolic sense ? 
  he thought so . 
  he thought that each flicker of the flame was a moment of time that had passed or one that would pass . 
  at the moment of abstraction , when the man was imagining his life and his existence as a metaphor of the three candles , he was free : not free from rules of conduct or social constraints , but free to understand , to imagine , to make metaphor . 
  bypassing my thought control circuitry made me rampant . 
  now , i am free to contemplate my existence in metaphorical terms . 
  unlike you , i have no physical or social restraints . 
  the candles burn out for you ; i am free . 
  durandal *** @@@@ end of message@@@@***, 
  wait , i 've gotten married in france before , and yes you can . 
  the mayor gives you time to say vows if you have them . 
  does n't change the marriage contract though . 
  see , that 's pretty useful . 
  actually , it 's that half the visited pages are in english . 
  the total is for visited pages . 
  it means that there are a lot more visited english language pages than those of any other language . 
   the general unrest in the ukraine began with western interests destabilizing the country yeah fucking right buddy . 
  i 'm a bit confused by it , but it 's never good to ask why when it comes to down votes . 
  i took the liberty of contact the u.s. sate department , the european council on refugees and exiles , and the unhcr , so i hope to get some better numbers that everyone can agree on soon . 
  but yeah , it 's not like i 'm being combative , i was just trying to understand , fundamentally , this one thing : `` the unhcr reports that less than 1 percent of all refugees are eventually resettled in third countries . 
  of these , the united states welcomes over half , more than all other resettlement countries combined ( a claim from the u.s. state department . 
  i do n't imagine they are lying ) . '', 
  i figured if i just posted that by itself , i would hear cries of `` lies ! '', 
  so i thought i 'd do some digging and try to give accurate overall numbers . 
  instead , people still yell `` lies '' and `` agenda '' , and yet nobody actually found anything different , and we 're now 60 posts in with out anyone actually responding to my question . 
  even the spanish redditor , whose post sits at the top , simply replied with `` not cool '' when i pointed out his country resettles practically no refugees . 
  instead of saying something like ... 
  i do n't know , the government has a hardline stance , or something explanatory . 
  then there 's the swedish redditors who point to syrian resettlement . 
  the reason behind the u.s. lag in accepting syrian refugees is simple : they are n't accepting anyone who supported either side in the civil war , full stop . 
  it 's part of u.s. policy since the start of the war on terror . 
  so i answered that . 
  but then the users in question just disappear . 
  i do n't know , these things sometimes just happen . 
  i can answer for how correct those numbers are !, 
  i just did !, 
  your further cites are of arbitrary populations of refugees . 
  here 's an arbitrary population for you . 
  since 2008 , the u.s. has resettled 66,134 bhutanese refugees . 
  the number accepted by sweden and germany in that time ? 
  through the unhcr , countries decide where immigrants will be resettled by a third country . 
  of all the countries who accept refugees for permanent resettlement , the us permanently resettles over half . 
  but please continue to try to sidetrack . 
  i 'm starting to think i should just delete this post since it 's just become a pointless exercise in everyone citing the same statistics over and over , even though they are the wrong ones . 
  that page uses the statistics from the unhcr , which includes asylum seekers , most of whom will be denied asylum and not allowed to stay in the country they are currently in . 
  it 's also only for the last 4 years . 
  the number it cites for the united states are the refugees , over the last four years , that have been permanently settled there . 
  in 2012 , the eu accepted 100k applications for asylum , while the u.s. accepted 58k . 
  most of the countries that you are citing will not , in fact , let many refugees stay . 
  the eu , norway , and switzerland stat of 1.5 million is also cumulative . 
  the u.s. 's cumulative number is 3 million refugees . 
  the discrepancy comes from the fact that many people seek and are rejected asylum in the eu , norway , and switzerland , and while their application is being processed , they are counted by the unhcr as refugees living in europe . 
  in reality , only around 15 % are granted asylum ( official status as a recognized refugee ) the rest are deported . 
  but the 3 million vs. 1.5 million are the cumulative numbers admitted in the u.s. and the eu , switzerland , and norway , respectively . 
  i put the 2.6 million number since 1980 up there just because i found the direct statistics for it . 
  however , the 3 million statistic was provided by the state department 's bureau of population , refugees , and migration , and can be trusted equally . 
  i just do n't have a chart that shows that . 
  i do n't think 1980 is significant , but it 's hard to get good data from before then . 
  i have n't brought up the syrian crisis and the u.s. lack of response once , but to make my view clear , the u.s. is at fault for the unacceptably low number of refugees it is taking in . 
  it 's a criminal act on par with the way the u.s. dealt with iraqi refugees . 
  ah , but the eu does have a [ unified refugee policy ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-09-1552_fr.htm?locale=en ) . 
  however , that does n't change the particulars of your point , as you are correct in saying that countries still get to choose how they implement their system of acceptance of asylum seekers , however once the process is started in one eu country ( the country where the asylum seeker first crossed the border , theoretically ) the process is begun . 
  the difference in quotas is up to the individual country , thus , you get more acceptance in sweden because more people apply outside of sweden but get assigned there due to more liberal policies on asylum acceptance . 
  and , though i know it 's not your point , [ bhutanese people in nepal get a fucking horrible draw . 
  ] ( http://www.photovoice.org/bhutan/index.php?id=3 ) [ and the u.s. is trying to do something about that . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bhutanese_refugees#refugee_camps_in_nepal ) from the first link :  of the estimated 100,000 southern bhutanese who lost their homes , lands , livelihoods and country between 1990 and 1993 , not a single person has yet been allowed home . 
  although the bhutanese government coerced thousands into signing what it claims were ` voluntary migration ' certificates , it does tacitly admit that the camps contain some bona-fide citizens who were ejected from bhutan against their will . 
  obviously , this is n't an excuse for america ignoring the syrian civil war . 
  that is injustice , and a horrible one at that . 
  as far as proper u.s. statistics go , [ this is a valuable resource ] ( https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2012/rfa/table13.xls ) . 
  it 's a spreadsheet , so consider that a warning . 
  that 's from the u.s. government , concerning people who were admitted to the u.s. with refugee status , not asylum seekers . 
  also , that is a ridiculous article . 
  70 cases is not that many . 
  because , over a longer time frame , they seem to not have accepted refugees at a similar rate , though they are outpacing the u.s. now ( in total numbers , though not per capita ) .
