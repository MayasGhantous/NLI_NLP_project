i 'm in favor of letting the russians save you all next time and us staying out of it, 
   that 's an intersting version of how ww1 started , a little different to the mainstream view . 
  have you ever considered questioning your history books or asking people from the balkans about it ? 
  traditional hebrew script looks very similar to phoenician . 
  modern hebrew is actually written in `` assyrian script '' . 
   it 's toothless insofar as it wo n't affect german policy decisions let 's see you say that when we extract some sort of payment or economic concession . 
  i did research in statistics and applied mathematics at the university of washington and the technion . 
  my local trump meetup includes university of washington faculty , successful software engineers , medical professionals , and many others with advanced degrees . 
  you might be served by using your own eyes and observations rather than relying on editorials disguised as `` news '' . 
  why is it toothless ? 
  give it a few months and you may hear americans thinking `` 300 billion '' every time they hear `` germany '' . 
  and as far as influence , what kind of influence do you think most americans care about ? 
  ** beautiful ** as an american who voted.enthusiastically for president trump , this is exactly the kind of reckoning with europe many of us want . 
  many americans are not thrilled with europeans who talk endless trash about us and then rely on us for defense , our testing of pharmaceuticals , research institutions , and parrot our popular culture . 
  i know it might not be a popular opinion here , but thought you all might appreciate a window into the thought process of many americans . 
  for your demographic curiosity , i 'm under 30 , graduate school educated , and living in a major city . 
  oh yes ... jordan , [ the lovely place where 110 of 120 mps voted to pardon and release the soldier who slaughtered 7 jewish school girls ] ( http://www.jpost.com/middle-east/jordanian-mps-release-island-of-peace-massacre-murderer-309626 ) . 
   muslims and christians and jews have lived in europe side by side , for centuries in many cases . 
  if by `` living side by side '' you mean the conditions of the ottoman empire and islamic spain , i think most people do n't want to return to that . 
   europe has not been asked to solve all of the problems , in fact it has been asked to do one thing by these people . 
  give them a place that they may live . 
  why ca n't they ask saudi , pakistan , indonesia , iran , or any of the large , existing muslim countries . 
  i think islam is a far bigger threat . 
  in france and belgium , the jewish community has been targeted multiple times violently . 
  edit : i edited because i see you are jewish . 
  maybe the nationalist parties are different in europe . 
  in the us , i ( hebrew speaker and ethnic jew ) feel quite comfortable with our supposed `` far-right '' , voted and campaigned hard for president trump , join marches and speak out against islamism , and am very optimistic . 
  obama played some numerical games , and that is widely cited . 
  if i was n't drunk now i would send . 
  do n't fall for the fake news , many of us in the us are happier than we thought . 
  jobs are being added and debt is getting cut . 
  vote right . 
  your children will thank you, 
  jokes on them when the dutch come out and vote for geert in record numbers, 
  coulter 's law, 
  other countries can follow our example too !, 
  it is an actual social marxist cult, 
  as someone with jewish heritage , i will smugly look at you , wag my finger , and say , `` not diverse enough !!! '' . 
  those jews and the crazy communists on the left are psychos , not worth listening to . 
  and do n't listen to the haters at the un . 
  they are toothless , jealous , and not worth caring about . 
  israel has been doing it for a while with no real consequences . 
  sounds good . 
  i would not cry a single tear if us bases leave spain and i 'm latino . 
   you inevitably do n't know this , but the only time article 5 of nato has been invoked was after 9/11 ahhhh yes . 
  the predictable smug european response . 
  well you are wrong . 
  much of us do know . 
  and some countries were much better than others ( spain ) , others barely contributed a nominal amount of troops , and others were outright obstructionist ( turkey ) . 
  ** the view from an american trump supporter **  - wishing the eu to disintegrate . 
  while we are done from forcing our way of lives on others internationally , many americans sympathize with those who resist large unaccountable global bodies ( especially socialist ones ) trying to force things , like regulations and migrants , to people who do n't want them . 
   - threatening to pull out of nato . 
  great !, 
  why should the us pay for estonia , turkey , greece , albania , or spain 's defense ? 
  having seen europeans bash americans repeatedly in forums and in-person over the years , ** this feels like a big rip-off ** . 
  i 'm not of european origin ( like an increasing amount of americans ) , and really do n't care about european problems , especially self-inflicted ones . 
   - pulling out of trade agreements . 
  why would we take any advice from countries that have persistent , widespread youth unemployment ? 
  why incentivize jobs going * away * from the country ? 
  the huge tpp may have had the goal of containing china , but why not have smaller , bilateral deals that are more dynamic and flexible , over a huge opaque monstrosity ? 
  it is bizarre how much leftists want to materialize `` anti-semitism '' whenever it is convenient to them . 
  there are plenty of jews against soros . 
  gosh ... 
  i 'm a hebrew speaker and think that assertion that `` targeting soros = targeting jews '' is ridiculous . 
  many of the early greek philosophers spent time in the persian empire and we 're heavily influenced by them . 
  definitely ** not ** academically legitimate . 
  most jews eat bacon these days . 
   the different religions tolerated each other and lived together , which is more than can be said of other regions what other region is comparably backwards to the middle east in this regard ? 
   mosques , churches , synagogues it 's all there . 
  do you realize that the synagogues in the middle east are almost completely empty now ? 
  ( with the exception of a few in tunisia , turkey , and iran ) have you ever been to a middle eastern church ? 
  they all require armed security guards and metal detectors ... if you want to visit the istanbul synagogues you have to apply to their website weeks in advance and show them your passport . 
   we should get from our high horses from time to time , we 've had our own share of historical massacres . 
  yes . 
  i think europeans need to stop trying to push their way of life on people who do n't want it . 
  this is the unicef chart on fgm prevalence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/female_genital_mutilation#/media/file:fgm_prevalence_15%e2%80%9349_ ( 2016 ) . jpg note : even christians in places like ethiopia , eritrea , and egypt regularly have fgm done to them . 
   people there are actually a pretty diverse bunch . 
  diverse in what way ? 
  yes , there are many different ways people observe judaism in israel , but there is a lot of shared culture , traditions , history , and genetics . 
  most people in israel live in a town that is homogeneous and there are laws to preserve that . 
  haredi towns are normally over 90 % haredi , arab villages are almost always 99 % arab , and secular towns tend to be overwhelmingly secular . 
  of course , the cities are different , but even there , the neighborhoods are generally distinct . 
  in egypt , the overwhelming majority of the people have similar genetics ( ancient egyptian mixed with a little arab . 
  christians are mostly without the arab mixture but they are less than 10 % ) . 
   not a lot of place for ethnic strife . 
  there were regular massacres against jewish people , from morocco to yemen to iran ( i know , they were n't ottoman ) , where jews would get slaughtered and robbed in big numbers every few decades . 
  anyone who tries to sell you this , `` jews lived peacefully under muslim rule '' fairy tale is selling you a myth . 
  and guess what , in those areas , ** jews lived in the jewish quarters ** . 
  in iran , jews were even forbidden to live around non-jews in many cities until around 100 years ago so they had distinct neighborhoods . 
  that is why there is a `` jewish quarter '' in many arab cities - because they were not supposed to live around muslims under sharia law . 
   i just told you that nobody wants a fucking ethno state . 
  have you ever actually * been * to the middle east ? 
  i would say the overwhelming majority of people there prefer to live in an ethnostate . 
  there are ever decreasing numbers of americans willing to bail western europe out of this slow suicide . 
  did n't spain have to kick out granada muslims again in the 1600s after trying to coexist post 1492 ? 
  so promoting kids is now anti-lgbt ? 
  the eu 's main leaders are childless and that is weird . 
  when people with a different language show up , demanding taxes and young men for fighting , and prohibit the native inhabitants from speaking their own language , i will call that colonialism . 
  for those who do n't know , there are large areas of the southeast of turkey that are nearly 100 % kurdish . 
  given that europe was forced to decolonize , i think turkey should do the same if they wanted to actually be a part or europe .
