  ontario and west coast usa . 
  they are insanely similar . 
  canada is more expensive and , as a whole , colder ... but over all there 's really not a huge difference . 
  you could cross the boarder and not realize you 're in a different country to be honest . 
  as a californian i felt that ontario was way more similar to where i grew up than the south of the usa is .

  correct me if i 'm wrong , but outside of the london , i feel like houses are not that expensive , no ? 
  there 's a `` british tv show '' section on netflix that i just discovered so i started watching a show called `` escape to the country '' and was amazed at how cheap some of the homes were . 
  man do the french ( and italians ) know how to make some amazing cheese . 
  i was amazed at how cheep amazing cheese was while i was there . 
  i agree , i found german cheese to be gross but to each their own . 
  yeah that does n't surprise me, 
  sorry , i worded it wrong , it was the bar of a restaurant . 
  yeah , i figured he was being comical , it was amusing to both of us nonetheless . 
  haha i love this answer . 
  i was on vacation in prague with my mom . 
  we went to a bar and he asked my mom what size beer she wanted , she responded with `` small please '' . 
  he then asked me and i said `` sma ... actually large '' . 
  he stared at me for a good 10 seconds then stated `` good . 
  small for woman , large for man , you 're man not woman '' . 
  nyc pricing is not indicative of the whole country , especially considering it 's the 9th most expensive city in the world . 
  good cheese is not really expensive . 
  i 'm not sure why so many americans feel the need to hire landscapers , my mom and dad love to tend the garden . 
  my aunt lives in this [ neighborhood ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@33.4684923,-112.085681,3a,60y,35.35h,81.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scowfvekodmvrt1hcbciyxg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) and as you can see the lawns are even that big , yet 90 % of her neighbors legit hire people to do their lawn for them . 
  i 'm not sure why you 're getting down voted for this comment . 
  we often get canadians on `` ask an american '' who state how similar the us and canada are . 
  i remember a while back this topic got brought up and some canadians commented saying that they were perplexed as to why europeans act like the usa and canada are so different . 
  in europe , are germans and sweeds known for having more poly relationships than your average european country ? 
  ummmmm what ? 
  have you ever even been to canada ? 
  the usa and canada are insanely similar countries , especially when it comes to culture . 
  i 've posted this before but . 
  it seriously baffles me how some europeans view canada .

  i do too . 
  buuuuut sadly we are a country with 320 million people . 
  her dad 's parents , meaning her dads father and mother . 
  my mom 's mom is german and both of her dad 's parents are german also so i guess there is just german ancestry throughout my moms side . 
  to avoid any confusion i do n't even say i 'm german at all anymore . 
  i went to the netherlands and did n't order any hookers or smoke any weed . 
  canada and the usa have had some schools participate in school shooting drills in the past . 
  i have never once done a school shooting drill and i do n't know anyone who has ever done a school shooting drill . 
  i 'm from the west coast and what i 've noticed is that referring to yourself as irish/italian/ect . 
  is much more of an east coast thing , they seem to take pride in their ancestry a lot more than we do out west . 
  yeah i agree , i guess a good comparison would be if someone from ireland went around referring to themselves as californian because their great grandparents immigrated from san francisco 70 years ago . 
  do a lot of americans actually mean we are ____ when we say `` i 'm irish , german , ect . '' ? 
  my friend recently said `` oh i 'm half italian '' to which i asked him a question about italy and he responded with `` why the fuck would i know ? '' . 
  i have to admit , i 'm i 've been guilty of saying `` oh i 'm half german '' because my grandma is from berlin , and everyone in my mom 's family including her speaks fluent german , but do i actually consider myself german ? 
  not at all , i consider myself 100 % american ( i do n't refer to myself as half german anymore , especially after joining reddit ) . 
  i had no idea that it pissed germans off so much , and i 'm sure if more americans realized this , they would stop referring to themselves as such . 
  british people are n't fond of the us at all ? 
  i 've been to the uk and have friends who are british , that 's simply not true lol . 
  while i agree the netherlands barely comes up in day to day conversation ( alongside with most european countries aside from the uk ) to say that no one in the us even cares about the netherlands is a huge understatement . 
  if that was the case then why do over 1 million americans visit the netherlands each year ? 
  there 's 30 million lol, 
  [ looks just like the actual paris , does n't it !,

  haha i was being a little tongue and cheek with my scots comment . 
  i 've watched tv shows with scottish characters and i 've listened to scottish youtubers , and i 've had no problem whatsoever , but i could n't for the life of me understand what was going on in shetland . 
  my family and i legit had to turn on the subtitles , we found it pretty comical . 
  yeah it 's a state that 's located in new england . 
  [ there 's a lot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/locations_in_the_united_states_with_an_english_name ), 
  not to mention scotts basically speak a different language  . 
  i am not kidding when i say that i had to turn on the subtitles in order to understand what was going on in `` shetland '' . 
  new england, 
  haha indeed . 
  there are even twenty `` rome 's '' in the usa and two `` new rome 's '' . 
  most of them are located in the midwest for some reason . 
  haha exactly, 
  good points . 
  i 'd also assuming that the amount of american tv and films that are seen overseas help with this , alongside the usa being in international news quite often . 
  i 'd say that a lot are joking around , but there 's a good portion that genuinely believe what they write . 
  if reddit has taught me anything it 's that some europeans can be just as ignorant about the usa as americans can be about europe . 
  haha yeah i definitely realize that people were n't being that serious , i just never realized that germans were known for their bread , so it was interesting to learn . 
  hahaha i did not , i think she would just roll her eyes if i did , she literally has no sense in humor , it 's ironically comical . 
  i 've learned that germans feel very strongly about their bread . 
  seriously , i had no idea it was such a point of pride haha . 
  it lead me to do some research on german bread , and actually lead to an amazing conversation with my grandmother a who is from dahlem ( berlin ) about y' alls bread . 
  gotcha , that makes sense . 
  there was a recent poll out and 1 out of 4 canadians do n't think they have a culture of their own . 
  i think this stems from the fact that they consume so much of our news , tv , and everything alongside sharing a boarder with us that their culture is essentially our culture with a few unique qualities of their own . 
  i think that as a country we are more exciting ( for good or and for bad ) but at the end of the day they are so influenced by us that you could drive across the boarder and not really realize that you 've entered another country . 
  there 's not much of a difference to be honest ... 
  while it 's more expensive than most it 's not super abnormal to shop at whole foods , my state has 60 locations and most of my friends shop there . 
  it 's not generic , you 're correct , but i was more so trying to state that there are a variety of supermarkets here where you can find descent bread , if your closet supermarket does n't carry any . 
  what i 'm not understanding is when people say `` bread in the us is the worst '' because our bread selections is not the same nationwide and the quality varies by supermarket . 
  you can some super shitty bread here , but you can also get super good bread , just like anywhere else . 
  what supermarket did you go to if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  for instance [ this ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0d/8e/da/c8/just-part-of-the-bread.jpg ) is your standard bread selection at the supermarket `` whole foods '' which has multiple locations in every large us city , and even in small cities . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.lasplash.com/uploads//324b/54c2aa234bbd3--2.jpg ) is also a local bakery near my house that a lot of my friends visit . 
  you got me at byob . 
  thanks for the suggest , i 'll make sure to check that out too !, 
  thanks for the recommendation , will make sure to try some . 
  i 'm traveling to london soon , and literally so excited to try y' alls curry . 
  yeah , i noticed that too in italy . 
  we did n't run into any communication problems in venice , rome , florence , and milan , it was more so when we went to the small towns in the countryside ( which is understandable ) we spoke spanish while in italy and that got us by for the most part . 
  i think he was being tongue in cheek with his statement , mate . 
  it seriously baffles me how some europeans view canada . 
  i remember some swedish guy saying `` oh i could never live in the us it 's way too difference than sweeden , but canada would feel like i 've never left sweeden '' .
