  i wish i could up vote this more than once . 
  yup !, 
  the tribe i did my presentation on was the iroquois , such a fascinating culture they had . 
  yeah i think there should be more of a global push when it comes to history . 
  we learned about the ancient greeks and romans , learned a great deal about uk history , french revolution , and spanish history to a certain extent . 
  though , i do agree with you about canadian history . 
  i do n't think we even spent a day on canadian history in my school , that 's pretty insulting seeing as they are our neighbors to the north . 
  op , what state are you in ? 
  i 'm located in arizona we spend a couple of months just learning about native american culture , then each student in my class had to write a full report on a different tribe and present it to the class . 
  ah okay , well then texas definitely sounds like the place for you . 
  especially if you like wide open spaces and guns haha . 
  just curious , what about the texas culture seems appealing to you ? 
  i 'm black and i go up to northern ca once every three weeks , and i 've driven extensively throughout the area . 
  i 've never once meet a white supremacist . 
  i do n't think it 's that prevalent of an issue that it would persuade someone from moving there . 
  it 's fine , you have to deal with raiders and dodger down here in la too . 
  haha wow ... thanks for catching that , i have no clue wtf i was talking about . 
  it 's not worshiped at all . 
  i 'm so confused by ops question . 
  i have n't said it in 5 years . 
  we do say it every morning in school , but half the kids do n't even say it and the other half just mumble it . 
  nothing . 
  the scenery is amazing , i 've lived there and it 's essentially a boring and more expensive version of the usa . 
  the funny thing is that a lot of them list canada cuz they hate american culture yet if they 've ever been to/lived in canada they 'd realize that both our cultures are insanely similar ( aside from our southern states , but let 's be honest 90 % of american states having nothing in common with the south ) . 
  it 's also a fairly popular thing to praise canada as a way to make a dig at the usa . 
  i 've been to italy also and it really does n't resemble arizona at all . 
  i mean maybe you could say that the weather is similar in certain parts of the state . 
  you are right about the whole spaghetti western thing though , which i always found to be interesting . 
  i 'm so jealous , that sounds amazing !, 
  yup , maternity leave definitely differs from company to company . 
  i 'm actually not sure what my company has ... i 'll have to look it up . 
  i believe for the state of california you are granted up to 12 weeks for maternity and parental leave . 
  most tech companies such as facebook , google , netflix , ect . 
  have amazing parental leave and time off . 
  for example , my friend works at google and they decided to get rid of his department . 
  they are giving him a full year to search for a job while still paying him . 
  yeah all of our sick and vacation days are paid also ... but it sounds like you guys have it more figured out than us when it comes to going about work/social life for sure . 
  germany is nothing like kansas . 
  kansas is arguably one of the most boring/ugliest states we have . 
  i 'm from arizona , located in the southwestern part of the country . 
  honestly , i do n't think we compare to any country in europe but if i had to pick one it would be spain . 
  [ this pic of spain looks like south/central arizona ] ( https://previews.123rf.com/images/stevanzz/stevanzz1211/stevanzz121100029/16459436-tabernas-desert-mountains-in-spanish-desierto-de-tabernas-europe-only-desert-almeria-andalusia-regio-stock-photo.jpg ) . 
  between the palm trees , cacti , bougainvillea , spanish missions/architecture and language throughout the state i definitely think spain takes the cake . 
  though if we are speaking from a european ancestral standpoint , it 's germany . 
  hmmmm . 
  we have 15 vacation days and 5 sick days that we are allowed to take ... most people use their `` sick days '' as vacation . 
  totaling 20 days off . 
  this on top of 10 national holidays and my office closes from december 23-january 3rd . 
  i work in corporate america , so i guess that 's pretty good for us . 
  are you not regulated to a specific amount of sick days in slovania ? 
  we could n't have done it without ya < 3, 
  not sure if you can answer this but are germany and sweden really that americanized ? 
  also , wow , i was not aware that they celebrated halloween in mainland europe . 
  i would n't call it an entirely british seeing as it was distributed/funded and marketed by 20th century fox , which is an american company . 
  yeah that guy seems like he wants to be nationalistic for the wrong reasons ( pure race/white pride bs stuff ) . 
  i totally agree , there are definitely some that take their ancestry a little too far * cough cough italian-americans * and it must be hilarious yet odd at the same time for you guys , but as i said the vast majority do n't and we apologize on their cringe worthy behalf haha, 
  i think europeans take what we say way to literally . 
  i say i 'm half german because my moms family is from germany and my grandparents are german , i do not consider myself german in anyway shape or form . 
  even in the olympics i will root for the uk and australia before i would germany . 
  it 's just a way of description , which is not to be taken literal . 
  it 's weird i know haha . 
  haha it 's always been connected . 
  it connects to venice beach , which is officially part of the city of los angeles . 
  sm is small but it 's connected to the second largest city in the usa so that kinda makes up for it haha . 
  my grandmother and mother are german , do n't worry this has been an argument in my household also . 
  i live in santa monica , not a bad choice !, 
  yeah san francisco would be awesome , if only it was a little cheaper . 
  i ca n't tell if you 're serious or not ? 
  do you really think that all 320 million americans are living in fear on a day to day basis . 
  i do n't know anyone who has been shot . 
  you do realize the vast majority of crimes are centered in impoverished areas in certain cities , right ? 
  to be honest life in the us for most of americans is actually rather [ boring ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@33.9334267,-84.6135358,3a,60y,279.62h,79.78t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scwrhagwulnf2fpgp7ftomg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ), 
  that 's interesting because i see so many french tourists in california . 
  of the european tourists in san francisco this weekend alone i 'd say the most represented were french . 
  what are the other two ? 
  not op but in terms of cities i 've been to venice , florence , rome , milan , bologna , and verona and i 'd have to agree , that i found venice to be the most beautiful too . 
  yeah no worries , i kinda figured that . 
  as i stated i expierenced absolutly no racism in london , paris , berlin , vienna , copenhagen , or venice ... places like london and paris had a lot of black folk so maybe they are more used to blacks than other areas in europe . 
  i just want to clarify that the vast majority of people i meet in europe were lovely people . 
  i just ran into a couple of racists , but that would happen on just about any continent . 
  hahaha that news paper article is hilarious . 
  it 's so foreign to me to imagine living in a country with a small black population ... to put things into context new york city alone has over 2 million black people . 
  i believe that 's more than double the population of oslo !, 
  yeah i think that the arizona design is pretty cool , looks great in front of a sunset . 
  the whole banners vs flags is not a clear distinction in the us . 
  wow that has a lot going on , it 's almost hard on the eyes ... i 'd say our buissiest state flag is [ maryland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_maryland#/media/file:flag_of_maryland.svg ) . 
  i love your british flag , have one on my house key chain !, 
  i can ... and it looks [ idiotic ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=american+flag+face+paint&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_1salzvztahux8wmkhe0jd_4q_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950#tbm=isch&amp;q=american+flag+face+paint+soccer&amp;imgrc=jqmd8nefq-fovm: ), 
  i kida like my homestate of arizona 's [ flag ] ( https://statesymbolsusa.org/symbol/arizona/state-flag/flag-arizona ) . 
  what are your thoughts ? 
  i also think [ nyc ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/u/us-nyc.gif ) has a great flag [ la ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_los_angeles#/media/file:flag_of_los_angeles,_california.svg ) on the other hand ... 
  haha no it was just first name . 
  haha it 's not that random . 
  i have some examples . 
  the other day , waiting at the checkout line , i had a batch of eggs in my hand and the woman in front of me started a conversation with me because she thought the packaging was odd , she asked if she could see the egg carton i was holding , so i gave it to her so she could get a closer look , this lead to a 5 min conversation . 
  then later on i was waiting next to another guy for something to print , it was taking a while so he decided to introduce himself to me , we got to talking and it turns out we both went to school in the same metro area . 
  so it 's not totally weird here , but i 'm assuming this is n't the norm in northern europe . 
  i will admit it can be super annoying at times , and i 'm never the one to start the small talk . 
  spatzle is god 's gift to earth lol ... but i loooove me some rouladen, 
  that 's so interesting .
