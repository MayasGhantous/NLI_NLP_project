there is pressure in brussels to hammer out the ttip details next year , before america becomes preoccupied with campaigning for the 2016 us presidential election . 
  so typical . 
  lbj escalated immensely in vietnam , yes , but his domestic polices are also a part of his legacy . 
  civil rights act , voting rights act ( ty for gutting this , conservative justices ) , medicare , etc. 
  admittedly , much of this success can also be given to the victories of the civil rights movement , but the polices should still be a part of his legacy .

  there 's also a wrecked russian fur ship on the wa coast . 
  you want that too ? 
  does this mean that swedes are secretly okay with climate change , assuming it wipes out denmark ? 
  hatch chile season in new mexico is on one of my lists of vacations . 
  and then congress would have to admit them . 
  i * so * see * that * happening . 
  yeah , we do n't get nuance at all . 
  jerk jerk jerk lel ` muricans xd, 
  which founder are we talking about here ? 
  hamilton ? 
  adams ? 
  madison ? 
  jefferson ? 
  washington ? 
  rum is always important . 
   socializing of state debt in the us in 1791 i have never seen any text use this phrasing for what was done here . 
  there were some nutty religious conservatives expressing support for putin some months back , but now with what has happened over the past several weeks i am sure they are shutting up pretty damn fast . 
  when you have jake tapper of cnn , an anchor who does not rock the boat ever , on the 24 hr network that tries to play up its pretend impartiality , criticizing the reaction by the police , you can say that there has been a reaction from all sides against what is happening there . 
  american then washingtonian . 
  you know , other than the majority of that panel who were pretty level headed in that discussion .

  only when the quasi war is mentioned can we shit on the french . 
  other than that , most of it is stupid jokes . 
  clearly the next list is to post the list of natural unesco world heritage sites . 
  the federal government in the u.s. gaining more power over the expense of the states is a good thing . 
  states in the u.s. have tended to be the more repressive institution in the history of the u.s. 
  there is a reason the 13th , 14th , and 15th amendments are , broadly speaking , restrictions on state power . 
  it took the federal government , not the states , to ensure some semblance of equality when the segregationist states were howling for inequality to continue . 
  yeah , i just find it amusing that it is dressed up in drag during pride week . 
  washington state itself has a history of socialism . 
  at least both states share the weed and craft beer thing in common . 
  also beautiful landscapes .

  i appreciate the diversity in style here . 
  nearly every us capitol building is in the same neoclassical style . 
  i do love [ washington 's ] ( http://imgur.com/a/03kwc#0 ) however , but that is likely cause i live here . 
  more often than not there is only one option , depending on region . 
  comcast or time warner , both of which operate as monopolies in those regions . 
  comcast wants to buy time warner as well , iirc . 
  still needs doj and fcc approval , however . 
  a note about this text : it is a collection of texts that he has written over the years . 
  this could be an article that was written in the late '90s or early ' 00s . 
  assuming that is the case , this percentage could have changed over the past decade or so . 
  edit : and yeah , he does that quite a bit throughout his writings , including his most recent book . 
  thank you , herpderp chrome plug in . 
  if my copy was not in storage , if i was not lazy , and i was not a little tipsy , i would scour his sources . 
  but i am all three of these things . 
  it is a fairly commonly cited statistic . 
  i read it in robert mcchesney 's * the political economy of media * . 
  and this guy is hardly what i would call a wingnut . 
  lefty , yes , but not a wingnut . 
  yeah , that 's why florida exists though . 
  try and contain all those people ( and jewish retirees ) . 
  which region ? 
  i love a good ipa myself and seattle has several breweries that make good ones . 
  i 'm sure he 's devastated . 
  / r/worldnews is such a good barometer for accurate and well minded reactions . 
  that looks inedible . 
  mayonnaise on pizza ? 
  the fuck ? 
  many countries are prone to be persuaded by propaganda , that is the nature of propaganda . 
  and the example you provide is a good example of propaganda , but it is also an example of a city that was the most affected by the september 11th attack on the world trade center . 
  it shows how bin laden was a symbol that was used during the decade following that event and up to his death . 
  so yes , effective propaganda i suppose . 
  oh yes and that video was clearly effective at what it does , given the like/dislike ratio , the number of views , and what i assume the comments are saying . 
  luckily wikipedia is a thing for when my memory poops out on me . 
  it is outdated , and i desire heavily to update the damned thing . 
  there are two mechanisms in article v that can allow for that . 
  a constitutional amendment can be introduced into congress , and it must then pass both houses of congress by 2/3 , before then going to the states for ratification , which requires 3/4 of the states to do so . 
  or a constitutional convention could be called by the states , 2/3 of them , and convention could then be held . 
  the issue here is that it requires it to come from state legislatures , which are controlled by one of the two parties , or from congress which is in the same boat . 
  i mean , look at how close the [ equal rights amendment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equal_rights_amendment ) came to passing . 
  it is a slow process . 
  you could only really sue if your personal voting rights were being abridged , such as on the basis of race or sex or age , and only because of amendments to the constitution ( 15 , 19 , 26 ) . 
  the issue with the system is that the framers thought they were creating a system that would be free from the divisiveness of political factions , when in reality political factions emerged not long after ratification and the first government . 
  if you look at , for example , the way we elect members to the house , all it says that if you have the franchise , you can vote for your member every two years . 
  fair enough .
