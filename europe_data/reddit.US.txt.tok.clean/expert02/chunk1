a continuing failure to grasp the depth and seriousness of vladimir putin 's grievances with the us and eu there are no grievances , just a lust for power . 
   an obscure clause in eu copyright rules means no one can publish photos of public buildings in belgium , like the atomium , or france 's eiffel tower at night without first asking permission from the rights owners . 
   the eu 's 2001 information society directive contains a clause that says photos of architectural projects in public spaces can be taken free of charge . 
  but the clause is optional . 
  france , belgium and italy decided not to transpose it into national law . 
  so it 's not `` an obscure clause '' preventing people from taking and publishing pictures of buildings . 
  it 's an active choice by these nations to deny their citizens rights that others have . 
  so the title *** should *** have said `` there are women politicians in bulgaria , here 's a picture of some . '', 
  all i see is two women standing . 
  maybe they 're giving a speech . 
  how is this supposed to demonstrate `` the role of women in bulgarian politics '' ? 
  the us misplaces that amount on a regular basis . 
  that 's a rounding error for us .

  thought this was / r/ifiwonthelottery, 
  this article is over 10 years old . 
   i do n't believe they lie about such budget surplus numbers i believe they do lie . 
  have n't you been reading the news ? 
  russia 's cutting budgets for basic stuff to expand the military , the ruble is weaker than ever , growth is almost nothing , and they have to spend reserves . 
  combine that with the fact that all news in russia is essentially state controlled now , and they have been proven time and time again to blatantly lie for propaganda ... 
   people should n't jump to conclusions based on this news . 
  you mean conclusions like ...  the mask was attached with a strap around the passengers neck . 
  this does not happen without deliberate action , either by the passenger or someone with access to the crash site before the international investigators came . 
  except , like the article says , it could have happened during the crash . 
  i do n't get what point you 're trying to make . 
  are you saying there was some sort of conspiracy to ... what , put a mask on this guy 's face ? 
   it is entirely possible that the mask was put on after the crash by rebels . 
  that is n't even hinted at in the article , and makes no sense . 
  the mask somehow getting looped around a passenger 's neck during the chaos of the crash , on the other hand , is plausible . 
   first , it can remain a member . 
  second , it can withdraw after a six-month notice and join belarus as *** the only other european nation not in the body . 
  *** ... what ? 
  let 's see , four of those nations are large arms producers ... and then there 's serbia . 
  it 's okay , we drink lots of pineapple juice , so it tastes sweet . 
  latvia : ` putin is potato ', 
   but article v has never been tested and no one knows if americans or french people would be willing to die for estonia or poland in a war with a nuclear power . 
  the americans are . 
  we love being heroes . 
  the french will do it so they wo n't be called cowards . 
  so putting the chicken in water makes it `` not fresh '' ? 
   in the aftermath of russia 's annexation of crimea in march , a petition for the `` secession of alaska from the u.s. and joining russia '' appeared on the `` we the people '' section of white house 's website . 
  the petition had received more than 35,000 signatures one week after it was published . 
  wow . 
  that 's hilarious . 
   armeninan diaspora in moscow exists for centuries i do n't say i 'm german because some ancestor centuries ago was born there . 
  you can hardly say someone is from a country if they 've never been there . 
  how many economic wars has russia fought before ? 
  it sounds like this was a series of crashes , not one big crash with 150 cars as your title says . 
  yeah , i 've noticed a major increase . 
  if an account is 2 + years old , has not been used until recently , and posts nothing but content supporting or defending a subject in a single subreddit - that 's a shill . 
  or block aircraft from entering eu airspace if they 're coming from a russian airport or have just flown through russian airspace . 
  they 'll have to redirect to a nearby non-eu nation first . 
   they will wale up only when russia starts knocking at berlin again ...  my point is , saying `` the russians attacked and invaded poor germany in wwii , we should have stopped them '' is total utter bullshit and i really hope nobody here is seriously trying to say that . 
  the first statement is nowhere near your claims in the second statement . 
   my point is , saying `` the russians attacked and invaded poor germany in wwii , we should have stopped them '' is total utter bullshit and i really hope nobody here is seriously trying to say that . 
  nobody *** has *** tried to say that . 
  invasion :  an instance of invading a country or region with an armed force . 
   an incursion by a large number of people or things into a place or sphere of activity . 
   an unwelcome intrusion into another 's domain . 
  by any of those definitions , the ussr sending forces to berlin is an invasion . 
  whether it was in response to another invasion or not is irrelevant . 
  it 's still an invasion . 
  the soviet union *** did *** invade germany . 
   the soviet union did certainly not invade germany . 
   and of course they marched to berlin you contradict yourself . 
  wonder how they define `` resilience '' and `` performance '' . 
  so russia has territory that used to belong to the ukraine ... 
  it is n't just referring to `` gods '' but `` idols '' as well . 
  you should educate yourself . 
  they do seem to have a poor imagination . 
  i guess `` thou shalt have no other gods before me '' did n't make it into the koran . 
  was referring to russian planes violating us airspace . 
  they do the same thing to the us and britain , and i 'm sure lots of other countries ( maybe not china or north korea ) . 
  i wonder what they would do if someone shot one of those jets down . 
  axis of evil ? 
   i believe a limited conventional conflict between the two is possible , but so absolutely risky that the option is n't really an option . 
  give the us about 2 years . 
  russia 's antagonism is forcing the us towards another republican president . 
  now that i think about it ... as soon as obama became president , putin started invading people . 
  russia has the largest country on the world , and global warming is making it more and more habitable . 
  they have no excuse for expansion . 
  by the time any of that happens , the western world 's technology will be so advanced we just wo n't need cheap labor anymore . 
  there 's already lots of serious talk about cutting the average workweek and implementing basic income - because we are already so efficient at production that we just do n't need everyone to work that much . 
  i look at that title , and have to wonder if this is due to rising income inequality . 
  best thing the ukraine could do right now is put down the rebellion by the end of the month , and petition nato at next month 's annual conference for immediate membership on the condition that the ukraine will give up crimea . 
  crater ? 
  the other guy looks like [ patton oswalt ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0652663/ ) . 
  demons in bed , 
  because begging lifts people out of poverty . 
  russia is the fox news of nations . 
  which is the desired state of all pricks . 
  the 50 us states have unique cultures , but the same language . 
   seville ~ ~ bans outdoor noise ~ ~ * passes standard noise ordinance laws *, 
  oh yes , the mystical elite . 
  this is totally about rich people and not the current situation .

  pretty sure that 's murica . 
  i prefer `` stoopid dumbass '' , red highlight , and ignore . 
  i especially like going into controversial threads and threads with lots of comments and checking out the bottom . 
   it 's a huge task , as we 've had over 70,000 take-down requests covering 250,000 web pages since may .
