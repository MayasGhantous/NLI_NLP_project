  so we now have a team of people reviewing each application individually , in most cases with limited information and almost no context . 
  that sounds really expensive . 
  are they charging the people submitting these takedown requests ? 
  in any case , i think google should be free to ban you from their services after they receive the takedown request . 
  from search to youtube to gmail - permaban . 
  and each and everyone of them is on a potential terrorist list somewhere . 
  america , for one . 
  making your own lime or living off the grid , either one is enough to get you put on a list . 
  in some nations , that 's enough to get you put on a terrorist watch list . 
  did anyone check the sites they say are censored ? 
  most are n't . 
  even reddit is n't , according to that blocklist website . 
  * damn commie also , hope the res developers included an easter egg to ignore this and highlight freedom . 
  what you 're doing is like saying `` you need to support that homeless man that 's broken into your house and taken up residence ! '', 
  yes they are . 
  these people need to stay where they are and try to improve their own countries , rather than break laws by immigrating illegally . 
  they should put a fence at the 12 mile border mark . 
  does n't have to go to the seafloor , just 30 feet below the surface and 20 feet above . 
  that is a terrible video . 
  ca n't see crap . 
  i 'm here for all your second opinion needs . 
   mutually exclusive i do n't think you understand what that phrase means . 
  thinking about borscht . 
  you and everyone else , *** bub *** . 
  move along .

   would you also say to jews fleeing hitler that they should `` get back where they came from '' ? 
  well , that is basically what happened . 
  no country wanted to take the jews when hitler was trying to send them away before exterminating them . 
  russia has been acting like a child pretending to be an adult . 
  or someone getting `` drunk '' off non-alcoholic beer . 
   yes , you seem to know nothing about cyprus indeed . 
  and you are a douchebag . 
  i thought it was obvious to everyone from the beginning that russia 's push into southern and eastern ukraine was so they could withdraw and be seen as giving concessions . 
  basically , a ploy by russia to distract people from and convince them to accept the annexation of crimea . 
  has ukraine asked for military assistance ? 
  was skimming some of the articles in the sidebar .

  that russian guy who 's shaving . 
  why did he cover his lips in shaving cream ? 
  just take it from [ george ] ( https://sacredpalmistry.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/george-w-bush-middle-finger1.jpg?w=307 ) [ bush ] ( http://chuck69.com/bush-finger.jpg ) and [ barack ] ( http://thefinanser.co.uk/.a/6a01053620481c970b017ee897876c970d-500wi ) [ obama ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bhbp1yn.jpg ) . 
  it 's a 12 day old account . 
  probably not sarcasm . 
   in the us the idea of a border fence is often seen as an impractical political joke . 
  no it 's not , 9 day old account person . 
  let me ask you a question . 
  why are n't you concerned about homeless people in america ? 
  what are you doing about *** that *** problem ? 
  found the commie . 
  you just go ahead and keep believing that . 
  duh , because i was copying his manner of typing without capitals to bring extra emphasis to my anti-no-capitals statement ? 
   and if you do n't care about people on another continent , why even bother posting on the europe subreddit . 
  america has to keep an eye on our ~ ~ subjects ~ ~ `` allies '' . 
  more like these countries fucked themselves up . 
   maybe you should have used your shift key when you started typing your first sentence . 
  never mind the fact `` i '' is always capitalized . 
  duh , i was making a point . 
  dumbass . 
  i cant be expected to care about people on another fucking continent . 
  also learn how to use your freaking shift key . 
  guess what . 
  people have suffered and been homeless for thousands of years . 
  do n't try to blame this on the us , i 'd say the us has done far more to improve the average quality of life of all humans on this earth than any other country . 
  well , i can agree it would be uncomfortable . 
  what do you expect me , a tourist , to do ? 
  feed *** your *** homeless ? 
  fix *** your *** problem ? 
  take notice russia , *** this *** is how you send your soldiers on `` vacation '' . 
  says the guy from belarus .

  us house had the lowest energy usage . 
  more efficient . 
   aside from very rare roof damage you do n't hear about destroyed homes in case of huge winds seeing as how europe does n't get a lot of hurricanes ...  brick/rock walls keep cool house in summer and proper wall design keeps heat from escaping in winter due to thermal mass . 
  having a lot of thermal mass does n't mean it 's more efficient . 
  the r rating of wood is significantly higher than brick . 
   those houses can last literally centuries *** can *** being the key word . 
  stone is heavy , and is more likely to lead to ground settling , which leads to cracking of the foundation and walls , which means expensive repairs . 
   due to lack of free space you do n't deal mostly with mices/rats/bugs etc as there is almost no space to accomodate them in empty spaces ( biting through brick is also way harder than through wood ) that seems purely anecdotal to me . 
  the small cracks that a brick/stone house will develop will lead to plenty of bugs . 
  i 've seen bugs in stone/brick houses . 
  http://www.kultur.gov.tr/en,35285/wood-as-a-building-material-its-benefits-and-disadvanta-.html http://www.ehow.com/info_12148730_disadvantages-using-brick-build-houses.html, 
   of course . 
  it isnt that uncommon to have 150 km/h wimd speed over here . 
  thats like starting 2 . degree hurricane . 
  why our buildings wont fall apart and when the hurricane hit us , everybody loses their mind ? 
  a hurricane is a lot more than wind speed . 
  your schools must not be very good if they do n't teach you about kinetic energy . 
  hint : air that is heavily loaded with water has a lot more mass and momentum , and delivers a larger impact to structures . 
  and places in us hurricane zones may be subject to these winds multiple times per year ( i see you had to go back to 2011 for your article ) . 
   how can you even compare wood with bricks ? 
  well , let 's see . 
  wood is more flexible , so you do n't have the problem of masonry cracking . 
  it 's lighter , so there 's less load on the foundation and on the land . 
  again , clearly the education in *** slovakia *** ( some 2nd world nation ) is pretty poor if they are n't even teaching you about basics like tensile strengths of materials . 
   americans that came to see their ancestors graves told me that the bricked house is sign of wealth . 
  congratulations for your anecdote .
