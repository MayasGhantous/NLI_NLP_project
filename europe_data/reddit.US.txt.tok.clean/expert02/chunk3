  does n't mean anything . 
  there are shitty brick houses and nice ones . 
  there are shitty wood houses and nice ones . 
  at least with a wood frame house it 's relatively easily to upgrade the infrastructure ( like piping , wires , etc. ), 
  as opposed to a brick or stone house . 
   95 % of all europe buildings are from brick or other stuff like that  99 % of all american buildings are weird mix of metal , wood , plastic etc. 
  and ... you think that makes european buildings better ? 
  us homes are built to much better standards than most euro homes . 
  for example , they 're far more able to stand up to nuclear blasts . 
   in general in europe it is common to design walls in such way that they will keep temperature but it will not export or import it . 
  ( double walls , styrofoam etc ) . 
  same with windows designs and so on . 
  duh , that 's what buildings are built like in the us . 
   this is why europe does n't need to deal with ac industry . 
  inteligent building design for place where they live no , it 's solely because of geographical position . 
  us building codes are among the most strict in the world . 
  and unlike many other countries , we actually enforce our codes . 
  so basically germany is saying `` hey , we are teh stoopidz , plz dont oprate in are cuntry facebook '' . 
  let 's just rename the north atlantic ocean to the american ocean . 
   greeks would have to pay taxes , or else the irs would come and start seizing personal assets , as well as put everyone through painful audits . 
  there is even a possibility of the national guard being sent in to maintain order . 
  the irs does n't fuck around . 
   obama would declare a state of emergency for greece and send over food rations . 
  fun fact : the us governments ( combined ) do n't have more than a few days of food for the country stored . 
  if there were a nuclear winter , they would not be able to feed you . 
  what little food they had stored would be kept for workers , soldiers , and government officials . 
  most people who survived the bombs and the fallout would die from starvation . 
  fema relies on being able to quickly buy food , and i do n't know of any states or local governments that stockpile food . 
   greek government would get a federal controller to hack their budget into shape . 
  and most likely track down the most expensive corruption and put a stop to it . 
  also , a few new nato members , as greece is blocking some from entering nato . 
  would the us join the eu ? 
  cyprus situation would be resolved quickly . 
  russia freaks out because of the us presence in the aegean sea . 
  in the us , when something gets violent like this , you either get tear gas , fire hose to the participants , or rubber bullets . 
  op figured he would try to cash in on some sweet karma with a shitpost . 
  i could have fixed that in a few minutes with a couple cans of green spray paint . 
  how do we make this happen ? 
   they was doing useless work , like measure sights who was well measured by professional company 's . 
  what ? 
   blaming the unemployed for not being good enough is just an excuse to justify not hiring . 
  not to mention blaming the young for not contributing to the system . 
  guess what !, 
  people contribute to the system their entire lives . 
  a one minute black and white video with no context and no audio !, 
  what damning proof of everything you 've said !, 
   if the uk simplifies it , americans wo n't change . 
  if america simplifies it , even america wo n't change . 
  if the eu does it , every english speaking country will probably troll them . 
  unless they started in the schools . 
  when it comes to universal languages , english is the best we 've got . 
  sure , mandarin has more speakers , but it 's geographically limited . 
  same with hindi . 
  the internet and most programming languages were made in english , english is spoken in more countries than any other language , and apparently it 's not all that difficult to learn . 
  of course , the language could use some cleanup . 
  simplifying spelling of certain words , for example . 
  tl ; dr a very , very small group of old guys is upset about some construction done on their apartment block 5 years ago , and are trying to use their status as soldiers 70 years ago to turn this into some `` russia treats vets so terribly '' thing . 
  american myself , but thinking of any soldier using their position ( especially after so much time ) in this way is sickening . 
  one apartment building having an annex built onto it is not nearly the same thing as systematic mistreatment of veterans . 
  this is a terrible stunt to get publicity , nothing more . 
  eat my downvote , commie . 
   pedant and now i know for sure you 're trolling . 
   insists it fits a description well , when it *** does *** fit a description , yes , yes i will . 
   he cribbed from an unknown source wikipedia article on `` invasion '' . 
  i see , so it 's not enough that it meets the definition , `` a historian '' must `` describe it as such '' . 
  the french landing in america during the revolutionary war was indeed an invasion . 
  they landed forces on soil claimed by britain with the intent of removing control of that area from the british . 
   if that 's your criteria for defining an invasion , then i 'm sure you 're aware of the successful french invasion of your country , during the revolution . 
  fine , if you want to get technical :  an invasion is a military offensive in which large parts of combatants of one geopolitical entity aggressively enter territory controlled by another such entity , generally with the objective of either conquering , liberating or re-establishing control or authority over a territory , forcing the partition of a country , altering the established government or gaining concessions from said government , or a combination thereof . 
  how did the invasion of 1688 not qualify as an invasion ? 
  it was a foreign nation landing troops . 
  do n't like that one ? 
  scroll up and there 's quite a few others after 1066 . 
  but of course the brits would rather downvote someone popping their bubble than accept the truth . 
   its history ( a former colonial power not invaded since 1066 ) false . 
   i may to . 
  full disclore : `` i may to ** o ** . 
  ** f ** ull disclo ** su ** re : '', 
   there would likely by a nato response whether they were a part of nato or not . 
  yeah , i seriously doubt that . 
  no nato country is going to go to war against russia for a nation that played the neutral game and lost . 
  if a russian sub was 40km away from washington dc , it would be in the potomac river, 
   it has been shown that nasa is way better at job creation and technological innovation than the military . 
  and where did nasa get the technology to get started ? 
  the military . 
  a rocket that can go into space can blast a target on the other side of the world . 
   the cold war was essentially a giant military arms race that has produced tons of civil technology as a by-product . 
  like the space program , not possible without technology designed for icbm 's . 
  not every project is a success . 
  those both involve lots of tunnels , which are naturally expensive . 
  a bridge should n't be . 
  the fact that a five minute video is needed to explain it does n't really help their case . 
  if their sole logic for changing the location was `` americans might not know wales is in the uk '' , then it 's a bad call . 
  but the article makes out like the movie was a movie about wales that also had a gay rugby player in it . 
  yeah . 
  i 'm *** really *** sure they chose to change the setting to ireland because of the *** name *** . 
  all i need to know is wales is part of the uk and britons are weird . 
   this is just one of the reasons why hollywood is generally so stale and uncreative ( with exceptions in some areas , ofc ) . 
  so , what fresh and creative movies are uk studios publishing ? 
  it 's their own fault .
