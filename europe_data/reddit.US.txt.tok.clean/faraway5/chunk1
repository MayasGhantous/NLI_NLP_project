pretty hard , black boxes contain a lot of data , at least 80 streams . 
  also they do n't contain radar data , i do n't think a civilian jet has a radar . 
   a russian blogger reportedly used a dashboard camera to capture video of the sa-11 missile system -- also known as a buk -- aboard a military truck saturday night . 
  the blogger followed the truck for more than a mile after it crossed the border from ukraine , according to the daily mail . 
  sadly it 's bullshit . 
  they saw something that looked like buks on two trucks far away from snijne . 
  here is the video that was posted awhile ago with geolocation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0ef2_fjka4  \u0422\u0435\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0443\u0432\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0442 \u0417\u0420\u041a '' \u0411\u0443\u043a '' ( \u0441\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 . 
  that 's 500km away . 
  it does n't have wheels ... 
  it has tracks . 
  though here is a possibility : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4hjmev5xg0 just to point out looks like its missing one missile . 
  the title says `` militants are transporting buk to the russian border '' . 
  the recording either is fake or rebels are confused which rebel group did it . 
  they say that the plane was shutdown by a checkpoint near chernuhino . 
  since manpads are out of questions , the question obviously is how cossacks from chernuhino got hands on a buk system that was spotted 40km away in snizhne . 
  google map chornukhyne or in cyrillic \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u0445\u0438\u043d\u043e, 
  the same can be said about ukrainian forces . 
  let 's wait for the confirmation especially when ukraine claimed that rebels do n't have capabilities to shutdown planes at 6500m : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10973212/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-shooting-down-jet.html, 
   why would the ukrainian government shoot this down ? 
  while its most likely rebels fucked up , there is one fact : ukraine few days ago claimed that rebels did n't have capability to shot down jets and then blamed a russian jet fighter . 
  so you do n't mind russia carpet bomb ukraine for shooting down their passenger jet : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia_airlines_flight_1812, 
  he does n't tweet . 
  he has only 2 sources of communication : http://www.icorpus.ru and some weird forum . 
  china is # 1 , russia is # 2 . 
  if you follow / r/ukrainianconflict you would notice a bunch of videos claiming ( by ukrainian individual soldiers ) that ukrainian forces are taking heavy casualties . 
  looks like a huge influx of armor in the hands of separatists .

  while i am a naturalized american , still confused : georgians are orthodox christians !!, 
  ukraine has marines or \u043c\u043e\u0440\u043f\u0435\u0445\u0438 ... 
  but i guess i know that since i am from odessa . 
   satire not hate , but seriously america , if you vote this bitch in , we will give you a stern glare . 
  i 'll actually vote the first time in my life to prevent her from becoming a president . 
  not technically true , since it does imply all of the serbs . 
   last but not least is the conviction that russia is not part of western civilization . 
  it is also not part of china . 
  it is not part of the muslim world . 
  well this part is correct , russia was never part of the western civilization . 
   russia itself , it is asserted , is a great civilization . 
  uh while i agree with this sentence , the article 's definition is way over thought . 
  and then the article is going complete retard :  accordingly , i feel that we should make it clear to the ukrainians that if they are determined to resist , as they say they are and seemingly they are trying to do so ( albeit not very effectively ) , we will provide them with anti-tank weapons , hand-held anti-tank weapons , hand-held rockets -- weapons capable for use in urban short range fighting . 
  ukraine has plenty of those . 
  anyway using tanks in an urban warfare is retarded , russians already learned that during the first chechen war . 
  ukraine does n't need military help , ukraine needs economic help . 
  so far i have n't seen much of that . 
  but this is a neo-con magazine , not much can you expect from it . 
  you got unlucky in russia and got one of the newer constructions probably brezhnevki and later . 
  khrushovki and stalinki were much better , well stalinki were awesome . 
  my mom had one and it had like 10 feet ceilings . 
  why do n't you send your kid to an american public school ? 
  / lol, 
   primarily western once yea , american schools ( 77/200 ) . 
  but tertiary education does n't really show how educated the population is . 
  that is the case with usa , a lot of students in our schools are n't americans . 
  and let 's not talk about american school education , the whole thing is just a nightmare . 
  i am still trying to figure out what to do with my child . 
  um you did pick the worst ranking , here is the complete list : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_state_university#academic_reputation, 
   i said , the last one million wells drilled . 
  i do n't know when the last one was , but this is what i read in a very reputable journal . 
  since you ca n't provide a time period then my original quote stands - epa said that fracking contaminated water . 
  so why do n't you answer the question that i 've asked you three times already : what time period are you talking about ? 
  i think you are the one that ca n't read the truth . 
  and what exactly you said ? 
  about what time period are you talking about ? 
  if 2013 is ancient then you need to check the calendar . 
  and since is that ? 
  1 year ? 
  10 years ? 
  there are many cases of contamination , let 's see : http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article1366371.ece http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/24/fracking-contamination-case-texas-judgement_n_5208624.html http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/06/scientists-tests-prove-fr_0_n_5461967.html, 
   of the last million fracked wells in the us , none have poisoned aquifers . 
  yea right , what a lot of crap . 
  us government agency said :  as early as 1987 , researchers at the united states environmental protection agency ( epa ) concluded that the hydraulic fracturing process can and has contaminated groundwater http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/environmental_impact_of_hydraulic_fracturing_in_the_united_states/wiki/environmental_impact_of_hydraulic_fracturing_in_the_united_states, 
   in fact , they were richer per capita in 1989 . 
  i do n't think that 's a fact . 
  in 1989 ukraine did n't exist as a country , poland did n't go through a split , ukraine did . 
  when soviet union fell it had a devastating effect on ukraine . 
  or they just will deal as businessmen . 
  make money , not war . 
  though a war is profitable sometimes :-(, 
   i speak for canada where i 've been living for the past 10 years . 
  i am an american and for a very long time ~ 20 years . 
  currently i do n't know of an easy way of getting into canada . 
  usa is even worse , we just finished getting our canadian part of the family into usa and it was n't that easy . 
  for canada you need to have a job and for that english must be very good . 
  the online site i know - http://www.cic.gc.ca/ and without a job the answer was - no way . 
  obviously step 1 is learning english , so they 're working on it . 
   odessa is a multicultural city where people are used to easily identify the origins of people around . 
  this is true , but one thing we 're also do n't identify ourselves as ukrainian . 
  we 're odessits , we have our culture , our language and our history . 
  most or practically everybody i know in odessa is against the current government and consider them criminals . 
  but also not many support russia - my parent 's generation is generally supportive of russia , while my generation is indifferent . 
  who goes on these meetings/protests ? 
  probably very few odessits and plenty of pro-ukrainian or pro-russia tourists . 
  like yesterday it was pro-ukrainian tourists that burned 40 people in that building . 
  yes , the country is being divided , since pretty much they 're forced into two camps where there is no middle ground . 
  ukrainian people lost 40 % of their income - they 're paid in hryvna and the currency went down a lot . 
  the prices on everything increased a lot . 
  a lot of people are looking to get out , but nobody wants to accept immigration from ukraine ( i checked us/canada ) . 
   i disagree with your opinion because the hate towards the terrorists have been growing jn the population . 
  i doubt that ukraine is going to break up without it . 
  it sounds harsh as fuck and the methods ( burning houses ) is not really morally ok but today was a day where the ukrainian side won .
