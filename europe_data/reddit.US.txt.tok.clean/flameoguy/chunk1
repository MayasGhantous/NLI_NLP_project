but , if you remove peas by default , then you will end up eating people 's potatoes even if they only put a few peas on the plate . 
  ( what ? ), 
  at least he used the sauna . 
  that counts for something . 
  if they were in western ukraine the could be hungary instead . 
  uh , sure ... 
  dutch , my fellow american . 
   birch forests [ this checks out ] ( https://www.google.com/search?espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=finnish+forest&amp;oq=finnish+forest&amp;gs_l=img.3...469.5043.0.5120.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.krb9tltrkk8#imgrc=xtkewlvuvowi8m%3a ), 
  the australian wedge tail eagle is a glorified vulture . 
  i thought slovakia was that garbage dump that poland and hungary shared . 
  was i the only american who had to remember the map of europe in school ? 
  i think i might be biased here , with all those history classes about the habsburgs . 
  small world !, 
  if there was any people that was willing to learn from its past , it would be the germans . 
  or , more broadly , the un, 
  yeah . 
  if nicholas ii did n't begin mobilizing troops , and if wilhelm ii did n't immediately decide to put the schlieffen plan into effect by declaring war on the entente , then war could have been avoided . 
  unfortunately , the militaristic atmosphere and the competing alliances probably would have resulted in war eventually , regardless of franz ferdinand 's death . 
  shelled it , actually . 
  i would n't be so sure of that . 
  there are [ clearly ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@50.3585994,2.7730143,499m/data=!3m1!1e3 ) crops being grown near neuville-saint-vasst , a village between lens and arras . 
  if the area was completely unfit for habitation as a ` zone rouge ' implies , there would n't be sheep on that land either . 
  in that case , america is n't exactly a shining example of pure democracy that i can use to pretend that i am better than you . 
  maybe someday ... 
  well , morocco did n't get in . 
  well , that does n't sound democratic at all . 
  why do n't we just all start smoking and make the immigrants go back because they do n't want to be coughing all the time ? 
  to be fair , it is a bit overloaded with symbolism .

  it only features one caption and ( if you 've heard of the belgian congo ) quickly and simply gets the message across . 
  like 1812, 
  that type of capitalism seems uniquely american . 
  no , just a council of unelected oligarchs to choose the president . 
  god bless america and our democracy !, 
  i guess the french are a tad less vengeful than the russians . 
  i do n't think germany ever pressed the issue . 
  i could understand considering it 's filled with commieblocks and old soviet missile silos . 
  if you were to raze london and build a london-sized city right on top of the ruins , i would be tempted to refer to the new city as ` london ' . 
  it 's worth nothing that many cities today are built on old cities . 
  it would n't be such a stretch to call kaliningrad ` k\u00f6nigsberg ' even though most of the actual prussian city is completely demolished , and the current city is almost entirely soviet construction . 
  `` hello fellow irishmen , i am also irish like you ! '', 
  always gets on the nerves of irish people when i visit my family in galway . 
  hill croats, 
  not-so-great britain, 
  i was hoping to see a comment from an australian, 
  if you really want to piss off a german , just say , `` wow , i did n't know you spoke nazi ! '', 
  no , standard mexico is just mexico . 
  on a scale from old to new : the european country -  the american country -  the state, 
  russian swedes do have a habit of getting angry . 
  finns are linguistic gods , i do n't know what you are talking about . 
  i knew someone from finland and they spoke flawless english , as well as swedish , german , and spanish . 
  no , of course not . 
  colonialism fucks places up . 
  / r/animalporn, 
  what ? 
  iceland to panama, 
  i think you mean * alsace-lorraine * , if you 're referring to the french provinces on the rhine . 
  this guy omits diacritics like a pro . 
  trump is american , fuck off heritage nerds .

  green = romanaboo countries, 
  australian , probably, 
  i 'm more worried about the beautiful austrian outback . 
  trains do n't go very far here . 
  i 'll take * misleading color scales * for $ 200 , alex. 
  yes , a stereotype and categorization is the same thing . 
  how am i supposed to afford a high-res map when i 'm saving up to pay for healthcare ? 
  you 're right , ` russians ' is better . 
  was n't ` central europe ' just a term invented to describe the area around the czech republic ? 
  and you are dutch lol, 
  the people on the float probably are , but this guy is bragging about how much he loves to reference american politics . 
  i have no reason to be salty !, 
  dutch people aggressively focusing on american politics is hilarious . 
  i thought we finally tricked the dutch into flying us flags . 
  or he just used the subreddits in the sidebar . 
  i hate when muslims bring their greek polytheism to sweden . 
  what ? 
  switzerland is a great country . 
  you should be glad you live there rather than some second-rate nordic country . 
  excellent comment . 
  high resolution ... jpeg ? 
  that looks pretty-much the same as the map ? 
  that was hell for those men . 
  why do we fight wars ? 
  really ? 
  what part of the country were you educated in ? 
  yes, 
  money collected by church = charity, 
  russians, 
  no , anyone who passionately denies the existance of vikings has a complex . 
  meh , it made the transaction easier . 
  a nickel is better than a nockel . 
  i 'm sure the local charity will appreciate your contribution . 
  perfect , hm ? 
  can confirm , share a head with a buddy of mine . 
  sounds nuts, 
  my cousin joe told me,
