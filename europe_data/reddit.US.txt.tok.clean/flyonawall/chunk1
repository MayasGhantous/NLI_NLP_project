yea , for some reason people seem to forget how much you still have to pay even when you do have insurance . 
  ca n't really blame them . 
  where religious missionaries work is often referred to as the `` mission field '' . 
  believe it or not , i actually first heard that joke on the mission field . 
  why were they there ? 
  what did they hope to accomplish ? 
  looks like they say shit more than fuck . 
  you just have to stop caring about being down voted . 
  stop caring about how many people read and agree with your opinion . 
  down voting does not mean you can not discuss something . 
  i get down voted all the time and it mean nothing to me and plenty of people will still discuss it . 
  all morality aside ... when major journalism bodies are pushing for accepting refugees , it makes me think they are supported by those in power and that would mean those in power have ulterior motives . 
  those in power never ( ever ) do things just for humanitarian reasons , they have a `` bigger picture '' in mind . 
  they clearly want to flood germany with refugees and are using the media to push for public support of that agenda . 
  why ? 
  why do the people in power , in germany , with the power to control both the message and the actions , want to flood germany with refugees ? 
  pretty funny in english if you ask me . 
  yes , there actually is a lot of evidence for biology in homosexuality but that really does n't even matter . 
  it is a moot point . 
  consenting adults should be able to choose anyway ; they should be able to choose who they want to love . 
  why not ? 
  so even if it is not biology , it is choice , it is still their choice and has nothing to do with you . 
  if you do not want to make that choice , then you do not have to make that choice . 
  you can follow your belief that you do not want to be homosexual and you can `` shun them '' so long as you do not infringe on their rights . 
  i `` shun '' religious people too . 
  that does not mean i get to tell them what to do or who they marry . 
  i do n't get to tell them how to raise their children , even though i would like to be able to . 
  why ca n't gay rights be seen as universal ? 
  and even if they are not , that has no bearing on what we do here in the us anyway . 
  womens right are not universal , never-the-less , women have the same rights here in the us as men . 
  no liberal is forcing their teaching on you . 
  believe what you want . 
  bury yourself in your beliefs . 
  but do n't expect to be able to bury others in your beliefs . 
  you do not have to be homosexual or even like homosexuality . 
  ** all you have to do is leave them alone . 
  ** you can enforce your `` rules '' and `` laws '' within your group ( within limits - you are not free to kill or rape , etc. . . ) . 
  no one is asking any religious person to change that . 
  you are only prevented from forcing your rules on others and in the public sphere , you have to respect the rights of others , regardless of your religious rules . 
  i can not make you marry a homosexual and you can not make me follow your rules . 
  would you approve if i tried to force you to follow my beliefs and my `` religious '' rules if i had them ? 
  do i have the right to tell you how to raise your children because i believe i know a better way ? 
  of course change is sometimes bad and eventually that has to change again too and no , decision makers are not always benevolent . 
  these are all reasons why we need everyone , including minorities , to have a voice and to make sure no one religion gets to dictate all the rules . 
  do you think all change is bad ? 
   you should n't be surprised if more and more non-hispanic kids learn spanish in school and adopt other cultural traits . 
  you still seem to be confusing acceptance with biological change . 
  accepting and even embracing latin culture does not make you latin . 
  just as embracing and accepting homosexuality in others does not suddenly make you homosexual ( unless you are repressing your own natural homosexual desires ) . 
  you also seem to confuse allowing others to do something you do not want to do , with doing it yourself . 
  just because someone else is allowed to do something does not mean you have to do it . 
  you also do not have a right to be `` free from foreign influences '' , what ever that means to you . 
  ** you do not have some right to live in a sheltered bubble where people are only allowed to do what you believe in . 
  ** that is a terrible idea and goes very much against the freedoms the us was founded on . 
  your freedom of religion ends at the point where you try to force others to follow your religious beliefs . 
  no one is asking you to be homosexual or marry a homosexual , only that you leave others alone to follow their beliefs . 
  other beliefs and other religions do not take away your freedom of religion . 
  you are still free to practice it and still free to believe what you do . 
  you are free to teach your children but you can not expect everyone else to follow your beliefs and your children are going to see the rest of the world at some point . 
   it might just be you who in the future will be subject to state pressure to accept a new official idea that is completely alien to you . 
  of course there will be changes , society is always changing . 
  it is not supposed to be stagnant . 
  we learn , we improve and society improves too . 
  edit : and just to add a point , the state i live in does not follow all of my beliefs . 
  there are a lot of things i disagree with , like all the religious stuff that is supported by public servants and the indoctrination of children . 
  no , i do n't get everything i want either . 
  i have to tolerate the presence of religions all all the terrible things they do . 
  if it were up to me , i would prohibit them from teaching their children religion ; i would make them wait to teach it once they were old enough to understand it . 
  no indoctrination allowed , but see , i do n't get to tell you what to do , even though it goes against what i believe . 
  you seem to be confusing * the idea * of being accepting of something and pressuring people to become that thing . 
  they are not the same thing . 
  yes , `` common sense '' and norms can be changed in society ( as they should sometimes change ) and possibly manipulated . 
  that still has nothing to do with pressuring people to become gay . 
  no one is pressuring people to become gay , only accept gays . 
  for example , say we become accepting of hispanics , does that mean we are pressured to become hispanics ? 
  we may be pressured to accept them but we are not pressured to become them . 
  i see no problem at all with pressuring society to accept homosexuality , ** there are things we do need to pressure society to accept and change ** , like letting women vote , allowing slaves to go free and allowing consenting adults to love who they want * ( limited to other consenting adults ) * . 
  edit : for clarification added the words in italics, 
  no , i do n't see the correlation at all or how that has anything to do with the topic . 
  how does that have anything to do with society accepting people ( and no longer persecuting them ) for having an alternate sexuality ? 
  people are gradually becoming more accepting of homosexuality , approaching ( or at least beginning to approach ) the degree to which they accept heterosexuality , how does that in any way pressure a heterosexual into being homosexual ? 
  and how exactly is this pressuring them to be gay ? 
  what , pray tell , is supposedly pressuring them to be gay ? 
  there is nothing in that article that supports the title and they include a clearly misleading statement . 
  the abstract of the journal article does not even mention obesity . 
  this is the summary of their findings in the scientific study they claim to be referring to :  the findings from this analysis contradict several common assumptions . 
  since 2000 , ( 1 ) price ( especially of hospital charges [ +4.2 % / y ] , professional services [ 3.6 % / y ] , drugs and devices [ +4.0 % / y ] , and administrative costs [ +5.6 % / y ] ) , ** not demand for services or aging of the population ** , produced 91 % of cost increases ; ( 2 ) personal out-of-pocket spending on insurance premiums and co-payments have declined from 23 % to 11 % ; and ( 3 ) chronic illnesses account for 84 % of costs overall among the entire population , not only of the elderly . 
  three factors have produced the most change : ( 1 ) consolidation , with fewer general hospitals and more single-specialty hospitals and physician groups , producing financial concentration in health systems , insurers , pharmacies , and benefit managers ; ( 2 ) information technology , in which investment has occurred but value is elusive ; and ( 3 ) the patient as consumer , whereby influence is sought outside traditional channels , using social media , informal networks , new public sources of information , and self-management software . 
  the science abstract says : chronic illnesses account for 84 % of costs overall among the entire population , not only of the elderly . 
  and the article says : about 85 percent of medical costs are spent on people younger than 65 , though people do spend more on healthcare as they age . 
  you might want to check your facts . 
  you know what is actually the biggest medical expense ? 
  old people . 
  long lived old people are where the money is really at . 
  obese people die too young to lead to much expense . 
  why stop at bmi ? 
  why not also punish those who do n't use condoms , have a lot of different sexual partners , get drunk , fail to see a doctor or take their medicine , regularly participate in high risk sports activities , etc. . . everyone who does anything that increases the risk of needing medical care should pay more .
