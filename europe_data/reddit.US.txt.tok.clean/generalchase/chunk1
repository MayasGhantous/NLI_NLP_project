as s color blind person this made me laugh . 
  i do n't get the color scheme either . 
  the s.s. may have been known for their resolve , but there are many cases where regular army divisions fought more effectively . 
  lol is that a division of the cyber police . 
  nice source . 
  is he a bond villain ? 
  he did n't specify gender . 
  you could very easily drop one on the front lines and make a breakthrough . 
  you do n't have to nuke moscow . 
  we also had the ability to start mass production in august . 
  i hope i never have to fight for anything . 
  i 'm not going to argue against your hypothetical situations that are based on hyperbole . 
  well seeing as how we let the ussr take over half of europe . 
  i see that as a failing but i was n't there . 
  i assume eastern europe would be in a lot better shape had we fought the soviets out of eastern europe , but this is all my opinion and not based on fact . 
  it seems to me to solve the problems europe is facing the eu needs more power over the nations it represents . 
  germany is leveraging it 's power against the greater good of europe , and no one wants to give up national power to an institution that can be taken advantage of like that , and i ca n't blame them . 
  would n't have any weapons ? 
  bruh do you know what my flag flair is ? 
  this is all very hypothetical . 
  i never said i 'd fight . 
  i said i 'd like to believe i 'd fight ( if the cause was good enough ) . 
  that i would do . 
  he lives in a very sad world . 
  drinking himself to sleep under his giant portrait of uncle joe , while quietly sobbing . 
  so is this european union unfeasible ? 
  from my perspective it just looks like big germany is using all of the poorer countries to keep itself prosperous . 
  i 'd like to believe if this happened in america i 'd grab one of my rifles or two and fight . 
  i have no idea if i 'd be able to though . 
  as always america has your back except for that ww2 nonsense, 
  this makes me happy . 
  i would n't worry about it . 
  the german military is n't what it used to be . 
  i do n't even think their air force has any working planes . 
  just a shit show every way you look at it . 
  i believe it gets to chomp away at tanks thin roof armor . 
  actually do something ? 
  complaining over the internet is much easier . 
  so should we come back ? 
  last time i checked it was france that fucked libya . 
  i got a good chuckle out of that . 
  be careful if you do n't love criminals more than you love your children you are a bad person to these people . 
  i 'm pretty sure having a mental problems is a prerequisite of mass murder . 
  i never said europe was more peaceful . 
  just showing the middle east was not as peaceful as u/aemilius _ paulus was making it out to be before european intervention . 
  but not bullshit . 
  that 's absolutely gut wrenching awful . 
  wow great argument . 
  so it 's ok to for muslims to convince people to kill because of their religion ? 
  or are you saying all the isis people have mental issues ? 
  exactly . 
  we agree completely . 
  the eu is more like a confederation . 
  i would but it 's too expensive to remove . 
  also there is the whole fact that the federal government can totally force a state what to do and how to do it . 
  are you sure you 've studied history ? 
  i believe the ottoman 's had nearly 400 straight years of wars and putting down rebellions and insurrections .

  this is pure gold . 
  so far . 
  people like to lump the eu as a country comparable to the united states . 
  if the eu ca n't handle this immigration crisis i think it 's time to retire that comparison . 
  american here , it 's the guns . 
  does russia 's population count ? 
  that and they ran out of people to shoot . 
  happy cake day, 
  do you trust uncle sam ? 
  hey i make no claims to the accuracy of the state department . 
  this was about nation wide policy . 
  if your visas was denied you can contact the state department . 
  do you have any source on that by the way ? 
  it 's not about danger . 
  it 's about people over staying their visas . 
  we just need a rail road . 
  how are you not downvoted into oblivion ? 
  rip wallonia, 
  i 'm not sure that is likely . 
  has n't thier market been trying to correct itself downward only to be artificially propt up by the communist party ? 
  japan paid dearly for their invasion of china . 
  yo ... you do n't like us russia-san, 
  there is no real need fire knives . 
  just buy cut up meat and veg from the super market, 
  lol ... you are coming off as really crazy . 
  que ? 
  does china have a lot of iron mines ? 
  or do they import the iron ore ? 
  well when we left germany to the german people ... well you know how it ended . 
  what 's that turkey has oil now ? 
  just do n't go to democrat controlled cities . 
  isis destroyed a lot of archeological ruins in palmyra and killed a very brave historian there . 
  if make a lot one might be true, 
  what ... 5 year plan ?
