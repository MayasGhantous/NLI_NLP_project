  after all , the roman and chinese empires knew of one another and traded goods over the long distance between themselves . 
  so while i look forward to dna evidence to confirm the `` asian '' individuals in this study -- and expect that that is not far off -- news outlets would do well to read thoroughly the articles they 're covering and not exaggerate their headlines .

  it 's the opposite . 
  like / u/drkhanmd said , the `` nicotine high '' is evident very quickly , especially when one starts smoking or very rarely smokes . 
  tolerance builds rapidly , though . 
  i have n't felt that `` high '' in years , and i 'm a light smoker ( and vaper ) . 
  that 's cause there 's usually drinking involved . 
  well , at least with my family . 
  for example , would n't be family christmas without my dad getting drunk before midnight mass and falling asleep in the pews !, 
  that 's why i had to word it the way i did , since it 's not explicit . 
  you 're right that there are restrictions on private organizations on their right to association , but i 'm not sure that 's even relevant to this discussion . 
  since you brought up balancing of rights and restrictions that come from that balancing , by allowing political parties , what other rights are being abridged ? 
  back to my first point in my first response , what do you think will be fixed by disallowing political parties ? 
  disclaimer : i 'm not a constitutional lawyer ( or any kind of lawyer !, 
  maybe armchair ... ) , so i apologize if i 'm understanding you incorrectly . 
  it 's also 4:30 am here so my brain is only barely working . 
  there is some credence to what he 's saying . 
  even before trump , this view could be seen , at least here on reddit , among even liberals . 
  admittedly , even i , a strong anti-trump person , have thought that europe needs to start pulling its weight . 
  i support the creation of an eu military force as one way to maybe do that . 
  it would n't outright replace us military support , but rather the two forces would complement each other . 
  ( not that i know anything about how militaries work ) but that does n't mean i want us to withdraw from nato or refuse to support our allies . 
  that 's utterly ridiculous . 
  i do n't want isolationism like trumpists wants . 
  `` parties '' exist in even single-party states as informal factions that have their own agendas and goals . 
  more importantly , the first amendment , through the rights of petition and assembly , allows for the freedom to associate , including political parties . 
  is there such thing as a democratic coup , if they 're attempting to overtake a legitimately elected government ? 
  probably tons of stuff ready to go just in case . 
  newspapers , public parties , memorabilia and clothing , etc. 
  just the way it is . 
  you 're right , but he pulled the trigger to get things started . 
  the people of the uk , afaik , can not call their own referendums . 
  they can tell their mps they want one , but it 's up to westminster to actually hold one . 
  cameron did n't * have * to hold this referendum . 
  there was no legal mandate that he had to follow . 
  sure he promised it , but that 's not the same as legally binding . 
  good on him for following through on a campaign promose , i suppose . 
  afterall who woulda thought this was going to happen ? 
  certainly not him . 
  and judging from responses , apparently no one else . 
  yeah , and ? 
  there are something like [ 11-12million illegal immigrants in the country ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/ ) , with about half coming from mexico . 
  is it a problem ? 
  i suppose it is , since it does drain resources from the public coffers , especially if undocumented workers are n't paying into the system . 
  though i hear many undocumented workers do try to pay taxes . 
  but is it a huge problem ? 
  one that needs to be addressed before every other problem ? 
  that highly depends on a person 's viewpoint , political ideology , and personal upbringing , among many other factors . 
  ha , this was my exact thought . 
  man , we truly are our father 's son . 
  no problem . 
  even i had to look up the exact definition of qualified majority ( w/rt to euro laws ) . 
  you make a good point , but even at the time of the uk 's joining into the eec in 1975 , the uk would 've passed a supermajority . 
  [ it was 67 % to 32 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975 ) . 
  additionally , i think it could be argued that when the uk joined the eec , the uk was n't as tied to the now eu as it today . 
  the eu 's mechanisms and apparatuses are institutionalized in the relationship between the eu and its member states . 
  breaking these bonds and linkages that have existed for 40yrs is going to be tough . 
  by analogy , it 's easy and orderly to construct a building , but it 's less easy and very chaotic to tear it down . 
  and in this case , it 's not even completely tearing it down ; it 's taking out core structures of the building , but expecting it to still stand . 
  given that , was it really appropriate to set the goalposts as simple majority ? 
  it mattered less in the beginning , but it matters a lot now . 
  qualified majority does n't mean only `` qualified '' people vote . 
  everyone still votes , but perhaps the votes from each constituency are weighed differently . 
  or instead of simple majority , a `` supermajority '' of 2/3 approval . 
  50.1 vs 49.9 is still practically split even . 
  but 66 % vs 34 % is a clear delineation . 
  can confirm . 
  i 'm 1/16 native american and at least 50 % irish ( possibly even 100 % irish on st. pat 's ) . 
  and i 'm a full-blooded filipino whose parents came to the us in the 70s !, 
  ^ ^ ^ 100 % ^ ^ ^ american ^ ^ ^ cuz ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ math ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ check ^ ^ ^ out, 
  hmm ... that does n't sound right . 
  i 'm not sure where you 're getting your information or if you 've ever even been to the us . 
  anyway , speaking from experience and from what i 've seen , having lived here my entire life , and as a native born child of immigrant parents ... 
  most immigrants quickly integrate and become assimilated . 
  immigrants ' children born in the us are `` automatically assimilated , '' by virtue of them being born and raised here . 
  and that 's how it works . 
  an adult may never fully assimilate or integrate , but their children certainly will . 
  the children * will * become americans whether the parents want them to or not . 
  you can read all about that at / r/asianparentstories . 
  warning , most stories there are not pleasant . 
  imo , the us is far more hands-on . 
  immigrants are quickly urged to learn english if they do n't already , to learn a skill or get educated , to get a job , and to get involved in their communities , with the goal to eventually attain full citizenship . 
  plus there are lot more things that are so ubiquitous , we do n't even consider how overt they really are . 
  expectations of celebrating the 4th of july , singing the national anthem at sporting events ( which is strange ) , reciting the pledge of allegiance at schools ( even stranger ) , us flags literally * everywhere , '' among other things . 
  all these things make you , or even force you to become american . 
  i ca n't argue the point on self-segregation . 
  it certainly exists in the us like it does elsewhere , but i 'm not entirely sure how that 's the most important factor in harmonious relations between ethnicities and cultures . 
  yeah , i just wait for people to start posting videos of the funniest and/or most ridiculous songs . 
  speaking of , you got any ? 
   as it turns out , reddit is hyperbolic when it comes to the us \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  triggered ... fuck . 
   all that 's left now is for people to learn from this calamity . 
  they , we , never learn our lessons . 
  '' [ wo n't somebody please think of the children ?!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh2swsvrrmo ) '' takes on a whole new meaning . 
  `` did n't know , '' in this case . 
  ha , well that 's the story here in kansas city . 
  and apparently we have more fountains than any city except rome .
