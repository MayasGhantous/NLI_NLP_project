why would a company not want their customers to be served in whichever language they feel comfortable in ? 
  this is a bad buisness move , and just a generally douchey thing to do . 
  why should n't they speak whatever they want on break ? 
  so when you 're freezing does the thought of your countries wealth keep you warm some how ? 
  [ here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&amp;tl=ro&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lemonde.fr%2feurope%2farticle%2f2014%2f11%2f04%2ffederica-mogherini-je-serais-heureuse-si-l-etat-palestinien-existait-au-terme-de-mon-mandat_4517448_3214.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) it 's kinda easy to translate it yourself through google . 
  assuming god is n't on the russians side of course , 
  and russia obviously is n't being punished enough , because even though most countries do n't recognize crimea as russian territory , crimea ** is ** russian territory . 
  laws and treaties do n't mean anything if they ca n't be enforced . 
  let 's not generalize , arguably the most important southern country ( italy ) is a net contributor . 
  russophone means russian speaking . 
  i think you mean the most russophillic country, 
  i 'm not sure i understand what you 're saying . 
  how does having one 's language become an official eu language lead to english dominance ? 
  i was n't aware that people donated breastmilk, 
  why are n't they that bad in italy ( except calabria ) ? 
  whats going on in belgium ? 
  i am 1st generation and i still keep in close contact with my italian cousins and watch/read italian tv/newspapers . 
  i 'm not saying i 'm as italian as an italian , but i do have a strong connection to italy . 
  well it 's just over generalizations so please do n't be offended , but i 've always though the english were a bit arrogant . 
  alright as an american with a strong connection to italy here 's [ mine ] ( http://imgur.com/4lbapkc ), 
  after the question about how many languages you speak , there should be a question about which ones in particular you speak at conversational and proficient levels . 
  how is this being cocky ? 
  i do n't think europe has to worry too much about this . 
  even now the eu is only 7 % of the global population , but [ 23 % ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/thumb/c/cd/share_of_world_gdp%2c_2012_%28%25%29.png/800px-share_of_world_gdp%2c_2012_%28%25%29.png ) of global gdp . 
  europe is always going to be pretty important even if it is just a small percent of the globe . 
  i do n't think knowledge of english leads to better standards of living . 
  look at the caribbean where everyone speaks english but the locals are still very poor . 
  i think it is ignorant to assume that just because a few wealthy north european countries are really good at english that learning english will lead to prosperity . 
  you can watch italian tv [ here ] ( http://www.italiatv.org/ ) . 
  yes because there are interstates everywhere . 
  i do n't think its fair to spend for estonia and finland . 
  if they want to do that there should be eu wide projects that truly help every member state . 
  i do n't see how estonia 's lack of funds makes it an eu project . 
  why would the eu do this and not finland and estonia themselves ? 
  even if it was an arabic emblem why would police investigate it ? 
  is being arabic illegal in ireland ? 
  i think priority is given to minority languages . 
  southern italy is still richer than eastern europe though , and i bet the top 10 % of people in eastern europe are a lot better off than the bottom 10 % of canadians . 
  how is it possible that the top 10 % in italy is worse off than the bottom 10 % in canada ? 
  we know you really want to , 
  when americans think of europe we think if the big countries mostly , so if we go there we do n't really think to visit the smaller countries as much . 
  it was directed , produced , and written by italians . 
  it is a spaghetti western which is an italian genre , and it was filmed in europe . 
  spain was used to simulate the american west . 
  these are members of lega nord which is a small political party . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.lapadania.net/detail_news_display?id=4215&amp;typeb=0&amp;salvini-e-buonanno-all-europarlamento--no-sanzioni-alla-russia ) is an article on why they did it in italian . 
  maybe i do n't know tattoo culture but is there a reason it 's associated with english ? 
  do youngsters not speak norwegian ? 
  what exactly is wrong with that ? 
  i 've seen the english version too and it is the same . 
  maybe its because i never saw star wars , but it seems fine . 
  except the cut after darth vader tells the kid that is a bit too sharp . 
  should be the other way around though . 
  libya is the most developed country in africa , and eritrea is the north korea of africa . 
  libya has the highest hdi of all of africa , but then again eritrea is kind of a terrible place . 
  so it 's a mixed bag . 
  i watch italian dubbing all the time and it 's fine . 
  i think it 's sad that some countries ' languages have so little importance that they are n't even used in movies , tv shows , or even books . 
  when i listen to any european raido stations it is usually either [ radio rai ] ( http://www.rai.it/dl/portaleradio/page-f089dd82-1513-4849-aa98-4c759191be51.html#slider-4 ) or [ radio margherita ] ( http://www.radiomargherita.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74&amp;itemid=81&amp;lang=it ) . 
  i sometimes will also listen to euronews . 
  i live in the us so i can only listen to them online . 
  in my car [ z1077 ] ( http://www.z1077.com/main.html ) ( a st. louis music station ) is always on . 
  english , italiano , and espanol, 
  that seems like the best way to do it , that 's what i do now . 
  otherwise i think it may get too complicated . 
  * are the icelanders in dangers , or is this something that happens frequently ? 
  * leave him alone , is it really that difficult to read what he writes when he puts english under french ? 
  * the article says that he received a good education before getting the job , so is n't it possible that he is verry qualified for the job ? 
  but the fact that no one else was asked for an interview makes me think that this is a case of nepotism . 
  ci\u00f2 che stai facendo \u00e8 molto interessante , penso che forse anch ` io comincer\u00f2 a farlo  * what you 're doing is really interesting , i think i might also start doing it *, 
  i do n't see any chance of this happening at all . 
  i 'm not saying i do n't believe you , but what rhetoric are you talking about specifically ? 
  the article you linked to has one sentence on mogherini with absolutely no sources to back it up . 
  glad to see federi *** c *** a was nominated in spite of the fear mongering tactics used by eastern europeans . 
  and i have to say i 'm disappointing that so many people on this sub believe tusk should not be eligible just because he does n't speak english . 
  as long as he speaks a european language that should be all that matters . 
  thankfully this is sub is a very small portion of the greater european mind set . 
  i guess only time will tell . 
  i 'm actually bilingual in italian and can speak spanish pretty well . 
  and you would be surprised at how advanced computer translation is becoming . 
  i do n't see why it ca n't be as good as human translators in 10-20 years, 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't understand . 
  how will better translation programs lead to other languages dying out and forming english varients ? 
  the empire spread english within the empire , which granted is a large area . 
  however english dominance in all fields even amongst the common people did not start untill after ww2 in which the us became the sole superpower in the world . 
  and we are more than a decade away from total english fluency in europe, 
   p.s. 
  : is n't it an irony that the britian has become one of the most eurosceptic countries also europe has been more and more adapting the english language and culture over the last 100 years and will probably continue to do so ? 
  i do n't think this is ironic at all since the spread of english in europe and around the world has little to do with the uk but everything to do with us dominance . 
  also i do n't believe that language will be an issue in the future because in the future machine translation will have reached the point that learning another language will lose its value . 
  i do n't see how this is possible . 
  if automation happens and robots run everything that wo n't be good for the companies . 
  if no one has a job or is making any money then how will these robots be payed for ? 
  you might say the answer is a basic income but where to we get money for basic income if there are no more taxes since no one has a job anymore ? 
  edit : also if in the future everyone knows that robots will do all the jobs then i guess there would be no point to any schooling . 
  honestly i do n't think humans will let this be a thing because it would 100 % change everything about our society . 
  is it true that most maltese speak at least 3 languages ? 
  ( maltese , english , and italian ) . 
  if so do you guys ever mix the three while talking among yourselves ? 
  rome , berlin , valletta , and lisbon are so beautiful .
