  oh look everyone france and the uk are fighting * that has never happened before . 
  every nation decides what to do about russia for themselves . 
  contrary to what some people might say , europe is n't literally in vassalage to the us ... so both ? 
  i do n't really understand the distinction . 
  `` should the us be # 2 , or not participate at all '' -- do you mean committing troops , or joining a sanction ? 
  imo , a few things 1 . 
  the us is war-weary 2 . 
  even if we drive russia out of ukraine , we might just be driving ukraine into the eu sphere , which does n't necessarily help us interests . 
  we 're not the `` world police '' -- ukraine is n't an ally , or even a member of nato . 
  why should we fight * russia * for them ? 
  to be fair , hungarian is about as close to `` secret ancient alien language '' as we 're gon na get in our lifetime . 
  nobody complains about greek megathreads , though . 
  armenian is as isolated as albanian, 
  hey , we do that too !, 
  you estonians are pretty cool . 
  wan na join our union ? 
  well , to be fair , the netherlands rose out for salty depths of the oceans in the mid 17th century , so it 's perfectly reasonable for 16th century ottomans to get it wrong . 
  a list where the nords are somewhere the middle . 
  the myths were true !, 
  ^ ( must be all that homosex ), 
  hold on just a fucking second ; are you implying that european means `` non-muslim '' right there with that azerbaijan bit ? 
  obviously the first island was just too big , right ? 
  thank god they did n't send him to ice or ire land . 
  would n't that involve giving a shit about greece , though ? 
  ^ ( too far ? 
  probably one of the greatest plot twists in history . 
  `` chinese guy says he is the brother of jesus . 
  twenty million people die . '', 
  `` peasant girl suddenly takes control of the medieval french military . 
  reverses the 100 year 's war . '', 
  `` defeated war general pops out of fucking nowhere and immediately sends the continent into chaos . '', 
  guy returns from island vacation , upsetting literally everyone . 
  turkey is a - y. 
  okay , so . 
  let 's say you 're putin . 
  your adviser comes up to you , and says , `` latvia has just joined nato , a military organization built in explicit opposition towards you . '', 
  do you lean back in your chair and think , `` ah , well , they 're going to remain neutral , then '' ? 
  that is to say ; do you really believe that you were being neutral just now , or that latvia is * actually * being neutral against russia , or are those things you think they should be doing , but are n't ? 
  you 're saying `` we should be neutral '' , but you 're also saying `` we should oppose russia '' , so you 'll have to forgive me if i 'm a little bit unclear . 
  i personally think we should handle russia the way we 've handled iran , north korea , and how we * have * handled nuclear disarmament . 
  i mean ; the sidebar includes armenia , georgia , and azerbaijan . 
  they might as fucking well include tunisia , lol . 
  if the eu loses greece , then bulgaria will become the only road into turkey , which would be a huge blow to their imperialist desires / s [ you can see the eu reaching out to istanbul , like a claw . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/european_union_member_states.svg/540px-european_union_member_states.svg.png ) eu may be forced to expand into northern africa before long . 
  reach turkey through syria . 
  yes , i 'm fully aware that russia is an aggressor , but the question remains , `` how do you de-escalate russia '' ? 
  i 'm surprised that georgia and turkey are excluded , given how hyperactively certain / r/europe is that both of those places are european . 
  building up a wall against russia does n't exactly de-escalate the situation . 
  nato 's not attacking , but they 're surrounding russia , from their point of view . 
  it 's not necessarily an unfair view , either . 
  adoption ? 
  it 's not like children and their adoptive parents have any less of a loving relationship than children and their biological parents . 
  heck ; with adoption , you fucking * know * the kids were wanted . 
  not every biological family can say the same . 
  i see we 're just shitting on iceland , then . 
  so , what i 'm understanding is this , and please forgive me if i 've misunderstood : the rest of the eu needs to invade greece and abolish slavery in order to preserve the union of europe ? 
  * groan * now they 'll believe in the effectiveness of online petitions , upvotes , and harassment . 
  let 's not pretend like the gypsies do n't have a secret agenda against all the good citizens of / r/europe . 
  well , we * do * have a ton of other responsibilities atm , like keeping the blue parts of the map safe . 
  but not having to defend the entire european continent sure would be a load off our back . 
  here 's the question though ; if europe started pulling its own weight , would the us stop covering for all the slack and size down ? 
  does n't that make now a good time to invest in drachmas ; once they seem like they ca n't go any lower ? 
  there are literally a hundred currencies in the world that will be more stable than bitcoin over the course of the next two or so years . 
  literally any of them would be better . 
  seriously ; you mention massachusetts before vermont ? 
  a scapegoat for politicians ? 
  idk , i 'm not an expert on greekish politics . 
  / r/paradoxplaza you 've heard of the civilization series , right ? 
  i truly do enjoy those games , especially c ** iv ** , but comparing civilization to the paradoxplaza games is like comparing checkers to chess . 
  it also messes with you a little bit . 
  `` belgium is a fake country '' `` austria and hungary are n't supposed to be that small '' `` remove kebab '', 
  well , uh , yeah , actually . 
  : i all of those places are in europa universalis . 
  as one of * those * people who literally ^ ^ metaphorically could not shut up about paradox plaza games to save a toddler 's life , i fucking love those games . 
  that 's easy shit , dawg . 
  can * you * point to cincinnati on a map in the us ? 
  how about omsk in russia ? '', 
  ^ ( the joke is that i , as a representative of *** the united states of america *** , am not smart enough to realize the difference between the two words . 
  but do n't tell anyone ! ), 
  why would we need the archaic british language ? 
  air guitar * didldidldidl waaaahhhh *, 
  hear that , europe ? 
  japan thinks we 're a prodigy . 
  ukip wants the eu , but with england in charge of everything . 
  hey , man , as long as they 're calling it soccer , i 'm cool with it . 
  i do n't know if you noticed , but the flair is `` united kingdom of the netherlands '' , and i was hoping that would be especially egregious ? 
  did i do it right ? 
  what would you like me to change it to ? 
  lizard people in government ? 
  who would ever believe such ridiculous nonsense ? 
  you know very diddly darn well what i meant . 
  if i were to anthropomorphize all of the world 's leaders , merkel would be something really really slippery . 
  i would n't say eel , because that does n't really catch her demeanor ... but she always has a way of getting out on top , does n't she ? 
  but yeah . 
  they 're older than balls . 
  not that the language has n't evolved * at all * since then , since it still has loan words and shit , but while the latin was transforming into modern languages , basque was already old . 
  iirc the leading theory ( yeah , * theory * . 
  i know , right ? ), 
  is that it 's a leftover language from pre-roman times . 
  really ?
