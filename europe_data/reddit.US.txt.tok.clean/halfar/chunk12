  well , fine . 
  i guess a londoner is ruining it for everybody again . 
  what if we just idk burned london to the ground ? 
  surely everyone would be happy it sounds like ? 
  i find that an aptly placed `` amirite '' can solve pretty much anything having to do with this kinda issue . 
  that 's a pretty fucking big `` unless '' , do n't you think ? 
  actually , we just do n't * know * how much nuclear material is hiding out there in the world , so it 's kinda impossible to verify their security situations . 
  all we know is that there 's a lot that is n't accounted for . 
  the ussr collapsing fucked a lot of shit up . 
  it 's like its 2002 all over again . 
  so the us is allowed to kill whoever it decides is a `` terrorist '' ? 
  cool !, 
   it 's on / r/all that 's even worse than usual / r/europe horseshit, 
   what do muslims have to do with any of this ? 
  it 's / r/europe , dude . 
  i was on the understanding that the dutch hate water as well as all aquatic creatures . 
  the idea of clean treaty borders in europe have always been fantasies subject to the whims of the swiss . 
  edit : shout out to the new eu4 dlc for doing the right thing and making cleaner borders, 
  the difference here is that when you were a twat , i moved straight past it and addressed your arguments . 
  when i was a twat , you could n't say anything , shut down , and deflected your entire argument onto my personality . 
  your opinions on me personally do n't make my argument weaker , you know . 
   this is about being completely hidden away and it 's ** beyond obvious ** that if you are wearing a burqa you wo n't be expressing your thoughts outside of the home . 
  do n't use that kind of rhetoric . 
  ; / that 's exactly the same fucking shit you see in every crazy reactionary subgroup . 
  ** it 's so obvious the government is planting microchips in your cereal !, 
  ** it 's so obvious that obama is a muslim !, 
  it 's so obvious that < x  . 
   this is about being completely hidden away and it 's beyond obvious that if you are wearing a burqa you wo n't be expressing your thoughts outside of the home . 
  what , ** specifically ** , about the burqa , obligates that a woman is `` completely hidden away '' and `` wo n't be expressing your thoughts outside of the home ? 
  have you simply never had a conversation with someone wearing one ? 
  does the niqab cover their mouth and leash them to their doors ? 
  have you never seen a niqab out at market ? 
  if you really want to have an `` it 's so obvious '' argument , it should be * so obvious * that nothing inherent about the burqa does any of the things that you 're describing , so a law that only bans the burqa does nothing to address the larger problems that you 're trying to tie to the burqa . 
  it 's a simple deflection , as i 've mentioned . 
  there are very serious concerns about muslim women being oppressed that wo n't ever be addressed as long as we think the solution has anything to do with what fucking clothes they wear . 
   it just does not happen in any society where the women wear burqas . 
  so ; a woman who wears a burqa ** will not ** be expressing their thoughts or leave their home . 
  this stands to reason that nobody will ever see a woman wearing a burqa outside their home , and that nobody will ever see a woman wearing a burqa expressing their opinion ... which is just belligerently wrong , since we can pull out an infinite number of examples disproving it , since it 's an absolute claim . 
   destruction of identity outside of the confines of the home simply is the purpose . 
  christ . 
  you 've got a * super * narrow perspective on this . 
  i think maybe you should actually just try to talk to people who wear the niqab and burqa , and find out it 's not as all exclusively how you describe it ... unless you seriously think they 'd use the words that you just used . 
   the proponents of this practice in the religious community even states that this is part of the goal . 
  that and some idea about preserving the honour of the woman and her family . 
  [ citation needed ]  when having this conversation with you i ca n't help but think of maajid nawaz and his comments on the regressive left and their embrace of all the worst elements of islamism in an attempt to be multicultural . 
  do n't be a fucking asshole , man . 
  as i said before ; engage fairly , or fuck off . 
  you do n't need to build up strawmen to address my arguments if your arguments are worth a single fuck . 
  i 'm not saying fucking anything about `` the regressive left '' or `` embracing the worst elements of islamism in an attempt to be multi-cultural '' -- the ** only ** things i 'm talking about are the burqa/niqab and a woman 's right to choose how she fucking dresses . 
   ou argued strongly that tools are not designed with a purpose in mind . 
  i mentioned assault rifles being build with a purpose in mind . 
  how am i being unfair in assuming that you think this tool also is n't build with a purpose in mind ? 
  the problem is that you 're not even pretending to attempt to understand any other purpose of the niqab/burqa , which is as ridiculous as thinking the hammer can only be used for one purpose , when the reality is that the hammer is a tool that can be used in many different ways for many different purposes . 
  you are n't honestly considering any reason for wearing the niqab outside of suppressing women , and that 's the problem . 
  in your mind , or at least in the arguments you 've expressed so far , the niqab can only ever be used as a tool for eliminating the humanity of women . 
  which is just wrong on every possible level . 
  if abso-fucking-lutely nothing else , it 's `` designed '' so that you do n't have to wander around naked , just like a shirt , or pants , or shoes , or underwear , or hats . 
  that 's two purposes . 
  no are we saying that all swiss muslim women that choose to wear the niqab/burqa are brainwashed ? 
  so what , precisely , do you believe the danger is with letting children see nudists ? 
  to be absolutely clear , i 'm not making an argument against what you 're saying , it 's not a rhetorical question , and i just want you to clarify your point in detail so it 's easier to relate back on topic . 
  will banning the niqab make those ^ ^ straw women believe they 're equal , or is it a different issue that needs to be addressed on that matter ? 
  dude , do n't fucking call me out on immaturity when your opener was  this rant is a bit incoherent and strays from the topic a bit but i 'll respond . 
  i hope you were n't expecting a * positive * response there , were you ? 
  like , great fucking god , dude .
