  i 'm not gon na act like you were doing me a tremendous service by replying and starting out with an insult . 
  your input is n't * that * magnificent . 
  do n't dish it if you ca n't take it , idiot . 
   read the comment i replied to , it mentions asking women how they feel . 
  i 've got a response for it right here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3u7auy/swiss_region_will_fine_women_up_to_6500_for/cxcqitn care to actually try and respond , or was , `` aha !, 
  the best you can do ? 
   if not , explain to me , how a woman is supposed to interact with the local population of any country if she is wearing a burqa . 
  since this would be utterly unsuitable for most professions , these women remain unemployed and suffer the negative social consequences for it . 
  it 's irrelevant . 
  if a woman chooses to do something stupid that affects her professionally , that is her choice . 
  i could ** precisely ** use the same argument against tattoos and body mods , but people still have the right to put 6 spokes in their face , give themselves lizard eyes , and cover their entire skin in tattooes . 
   you ca n't tell two people who are wearing a burqa apart and that is the design of this article of clothing . 
  yes ; they want to not be objectified , as you want when you hide your giant tits underneath a xxl hoodie . 
  they have the right to do that . 
  i hide my ass in loose-fitting pants . 
  sometimes , i have a bad hairday , and hide my hair underneath a cap . 
  everyone has the right to not want to be objectified -- shit , what do we objectify more than our ** faces ** , mr. acne ? 
  thinking that two people wearing burqas/niqabs are completely indistinguishable is , at essence , shallow thinking . 
  the words you speak , the thoughts you express , the way you behave ; these are all things that are still seen over cloth . 
  maybe they do n't want their philosophy to be disgarded because of a mole , or whatever . 
  ** regardless , it is their right to do so . 
  **  since i 'm making the assumption that you are the type of person who probably wo n't even admit that assault rifles do n't fucking assume my positions on anything i 'm not talking about , buddy . 
  i have n't said a single fucking word about guns , so do n't build up a strawman to argue against if you ca n't argue against my points on their own . 
  engage fairly , or fuck off . 
   this rant is a bit incoherent and strays from the topic a bit but i 'll respond . 
  thanks , dicknuts . 
   my point was not about islamic women in switzerland only . 
  it word be stupid to suggest this issue applies solely to switzerland . 
   it is no secret that islamic culture sees women as inferior . 
  as such , women need to toe a fine line when doing things outside the norm/things that their male family members do n't want them to do . 
  sorry , buddy , but i 'm explicitly only talking about the law in switzerland , since that 's the topic . 
  not the suggested clothing law of wahhabists in saudi arabia or any shit like that . 
  the parameters here have been pretty clear since the start . 
  nobody 's talking about banning niqabs or burqas in repressive islamic societies ; we 're talking about fucking switzerland here . 
   a choice needs to be truly free to be a real choice . 
  yes , and this swiss law takes away that choice , so it 's not `` truly free '' at all . 
  it seems like we 're in solid agreement there , at least . 
   similar to north koreans who oppose kim , muslim women will face consequences , generally , ** in switzerland ** . 
  do n't let the scope of this conversation get out of hand . 
  we 're talking about laws that affect ** swiss women . 
  ** the consequences that a korean would face for defying the kims , and the consequences that a muslim would face for defying isis are ** not at all the same thing ** as some completely and utterly ambiguous force that 's pushing for women to wear niqabs in switzerland . 
  it 's not at all an apt analogy , i 'm afraid . 
  switzerland is exerting zero pressure to compel people into having no choice ... or at least , they were , before this law . 
   by the way , i have talked to women who have chosen to cover up and they have all told me it was because they did n't want to be objectified/judged for their appearance . 
  fair enough . 
  i think covering the hair is obviously ok so you think it 's okay for a woman to not want to be objectified on the basis of her hair , clothing , or body , but it 's * not * okay for a woman to not want to be objectified on the basis of her face ? 
  that does n't seem just a tiny bit incongruous to you ? 
  either way ; it 's fine if you disagree with the choice to cover your face . 
  that 's your right . 
  but if someone ** does choose ** to cover their face , that should also be their right . 
  legislation should n't be based on what your opinion ; it should be based on what the rights of individuals should be . 
  that 's your opinion . 
  somebody else can make the argument that there is some amount ( if tiny ) of pretense or arrogance in wearing `` dressed up western '' stuff , like , y' know , jeans and shit . 
  it 's tough to frame this in a way for someone who 's possibly ( and fairly ) never been near the same frame of thought . 
  hrm okay ; what if you wanted to wear clothing that said * nothing * ? 
  you wanted to make as little a statement as possible with your clothing , for whatever reason . 
  you believe something along the lines of `` i only need the humblest clothing because that will help keep me modest '' or something . 
  you want to be a simple pilgrim that for whatever reason wants to avoid expressive clothes . 
  what do you wear ? 
  you do n't want anyone to objectify you based on your appearance , so you wear a loose hoodie to hide your giant knockers . 
  that 's using your clothing to hide objectification . 
  you might also wear loose pants , so people are n't staring at your ass , as you have the right to do and want . 
  you do n't want people judging you because you 're a guy with curly red hair , so you wear a hat . 
  the face is incredibly important to how we judge/objectify people . 
  certainly more important than our tits , ass , and hair . 
  * it 's possible * is about as weak a way you can phrase that as possible . 
  * it 's possible * misogynists will use the burqa to oppress women * it 's possible * they 'll use legos and friendship purity bracelets . 
  north koreans vote kim because there are people that will harm and attack them if they do otherwise . 
  if you really want to make this into an analogy , which i do n't recommend , it 's analogous to some shadowy islamic leader that rules in switzerland , has a military in switzerland , and has worldwide political immunity , forcing swiss muslim women to wear the burqa . 
  in either case , the solution ( in theory ) is to dismantle the kim family/shadowy muslim swiss leader . 
  which plays solidly into my point ; banning the burqa is , at most , an extremely superficial move against a much larger concern that has the potential into fooling people into thinking they 're actually doing something about the oppression of women . 
  if there 's some * threat * or concern that 's forcing or influencing swiss islamic women into wearing the burqa against their own will ; addressing ** that ** is the primary concern . 
  it 's anti-islamist theater that insultingly takes away agency from swisss islamic women . 
  if you 've got a leaky faucet , you fucking fix the faucet ; you do n't just put a bucket down and empty the leaked water every once in a while and dismantle your principles of free expression and emancipation . 
  a hammer by itself is just a hammer . 
  it has no ideology . 
  it feels no emotion . 
  it has no malice . 
  a hammer can be used as a tool to bash another man 's brains in , but this does not reflect poorly on the hammer ; only the man who is doing the brain-bashing . 
  the hammer can also be used to build a house , or many houses , and this still says nothing for the ideology of the hammer , or its emotions , or its malice , or its charity , or its diligence , or anything else . 
  the fact that you keep using the word * tool * should completely and fully discredit your argument . 
  tools are not evil ; the people who abuse tools are evil , but that does n't mean we should ban hammers or burqas . 
  unless you 're simply denying the fact that the burqa can ever possibly be used by anyone who is n't a complete brainwashed idiotic muslim woman ... there 's simply no justification . 
  and there is n't . 
  there are plenty of free-thinking muslim women who can make their own personal choice to use the burqa that does not revolve around them being brain dead puppets of some shadowy organization that wants to oppress and demean the female gender . 
  and for those people , there is not a single fucking right in the world to tell them what they can and can not wear ( mostly , because security w/e ) . 
   it confines them to the family home and excludes them from any kind of public life . 
  let 's be real . 
  if a burqa is doing all of that ; then we 've got a completely different and bigger issue that we need to deal with , and it 's the sudden sentience of clothing . 
  fortunately , real life is not * kill la kill * , and you were making a ridiculous and stupid exaggeration . 
  a burqa does not confine people to homes , and a burqa does not exclude people from public life . 
  if anything ; legislation saying that burqas are illegal in public do a much better job at forcing women into privacy than the actual cloth itself does . 
  your indignation against the suppression of women is entirely misplaced . 
  those that would use the burqa/niqab to oppress women are n't just gon na fucking stop oppressing women if they ca n't use cloth ; i can fucking guarantee you that . 
  the important action is to limit and dismantle the actions of those that would oppress women . 
  this is just ridiculous pandering that goes against switzerland 's values of , well , emancipation , right ? 
  like ; you 're still not admitting that this directly goes against switzerland 's values , ** in your own words ** . 
  by absolute definition , using political or legal means to restrict people is the opposite of emancipation . 
  using politics/law to restrict people from wearing the burqa , therefore , is the opposite of emancipation . 
  the only way you can reconcile this is to say that switzerland does n't value emancipation , and/or that it values something that is very much * explicitly * not emancipation .
