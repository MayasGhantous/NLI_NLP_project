  idk, 
  we can do both . 
  we 're fucking america , baby . 
  ( - \u203f \u25d5 \u273f ) even a quarter wit should be capable of understanding that having a livable wage does n't necessitate dismantling the military . 
  in 1968 the minimum wage was $ 10.71 in 2013 usd . 
  were we not the guardians of the delicate rest of the world back then ? 
  obama also had endorsements from the democratic establishment , and a lot more money . 
  it 's not so simple . 
  i definitely agree with your perspective on bernie . 
  he 's had a ton of chances to go for clinton 's neck but has chosen not to do so because of how much more he values good discourse over , well , winning elections . 
  and -- in fairness , clinton has also been doing a good job at this . 
  even as bernie supporter that kinda wants him to get a little scrappy , i 'm overall happy with the tone of the democrat process so far . 
  but i do n't think he seems `` weak '' . 
  heck , the debates were yesterday but i keep hearing the word `` angry '' to describe him . 
  honestly , i 'm about 100 % certain winning the election is n't bernie 's only goal ; he 's also got a vested interest in shifting the entire democratic base to the left , which you definitely saw in clinton the other night . 
  `` a race to the left '' , i 've been hearing . 
  a clinton victory is n't a terrible loss in his eyes . 
  say what you will about any individual candidate ; the democrats clearly have their shit in more order than the republicans , and it 's starting to manifest itself in more overt ways . 
  the republican debates have been shitshow compared to last night , they ca n't even find a speaker , and they nearly send their support tumbling again with * another * pointless government shutdown . 
  his position is that he 'll try to be a rallying force more than a political office navigator or w/e . 
  i.e , he believes the most effective way to insitute those policies is by galvanizing people into bitching at their representatives . 
  really ? 
  all the polls have sanders beating trump 1 on 1 . 
  what does he think he is ? 
  a filthy * european * or something ? 
  i assure you the rest of us good non-communist americans are nothing like this ... 
  * sander . 
  it 's much more complicated than that . 
  hillary has had a huge shift to the left since the campaign started ; the debate 's been described as a `` race to the left '' . 
  now , obviously i do n't think hillary is being completely 100 % genuine , but i also do n't think she 's just an evil bitch demon that is literally incapable of not lying . 
  the shift , though possibly slightly overstated , is real . 
  and i think a lot of trump 's appeal is reactionary hoo-hah , not so much anti-establishment ... but that 's partially because i 've started to associate the tea party libertarian wackos with `` the establishlemnt '' internally , so idk . 
  they 're called slippahs in many many places , especially hawaii . 
  it 's a lot worse than that ; the top 0.1 % control more than the bottom 90 % . 
  it 's not like those parties ca n't get representation in the primaries . 
  i 'd infinitely prefer having a primary process whittle down a field of ~ 20 or so people down to 2 for the general presidential election than end up with a candidate getting barely over 30 % winning . 
  europe 's doomed ** for real ** this time guys i know it, 
  riiiight but the op title is n't about spanish culture , conquered lands , opening of trade and colonization routes , or the process that basically led to the cration of the usa and the conformation of the modern , ewstern world as we know it today ^ and ^ all ^ that ^ really ^ heinous ^ other ^ colonial ^ shit . 
  it 's just about columbus . 
  the title is pretty clearly making columbus the focus unless i 'm taking crazy pills again . 
   what europeans did to others was no more egregious than what europeans did to each other and what those others did to one another . 
  but nobody is saying that shit was n't atrocious either , lol . 
   today , 523 years ago columbus arrived to the americas for the first time . 
  happy national day , spain !, 
  do n't conflate fucking * columbus * hate with spain hate , lol . 
  that 's just being ridiculous . 
  there 's too much good about spain for anyone with even a quarter wit to suggest that columbus , as bad as he was , ruins its legacy . 
  lol fucking * sure thing * , buddy . 
  worst things mexican militants do is deal drugs . 
  they 're not known for their brutality or anything , lol tell ya what why do n't you go ahead and search `` cartel '' on liveleak ? 
  see how much you enjoy seeing a dick get ripped off with a chainsaw and smeared on a skinned face nailed to a wall . 
  dude there are about a billion reasons to murder someone before ` they walked across a rather arbitrary border '' . 
  i take it capital punishment gives you an erection ? 
  your view on this is fucking ... horrendous . 
  terrifying . 
  buddy hitler 's been dead for a while now if europe genocides syrians can the us nuke brussels ? 
  that the world we want ? 
  i just wanted to say * thank you * you 're the first person in this shitty thread to actually have something worth munching on . 
  no pedantics , no hardcore ideology , but an actual fucking * response * to me . 
  i thought that if my thoughts were so easily countered there would be a plethora of ... not bullshit coming my way . 
  anyhoo , it 's 3am here so i 'm gon na pass out and read this in the morning . 
  what i 've skimmed seems interesting and will give me content to expand my thoughts on . 
  thanks again !, 
  are proposals a sign of power ? 
  is belgium or hungary incapable of making a proposal ? 
  you 're gon na have to go over the actual mechanics of how germany exerts its influence here . 
  a party in the us can vote to defund an institutions literally over a hundre times in one year , but that projects the opposite of power to me . 
  right ~ ~ there 's a shit ton more mexicans in a smaller space ( ~ 5 or 6 states ) with fewer `` natives '' and no buffer countries and fleeing the cartels which have an even more brutal track record than isis ~ ~ uuh whoops i meant to say that everything is perfect in mexico and 11 million people just went on permanent vacation and abandoned their old lives because siesta or something and there 's none of all that pedantic `` refugee !, 
  no , immigrant !, 
  no , migrant ! '', 
  horseshit , which is nice , since everyone agrees that they 're welfare queens that just sap away at my precious tax dollars by asking for stupid shit like healthcare and government services . 
  they generally do n't have as much education as syrians , which is also great because it means they are n't as good at planting bombs . 
  oh right and ** the 're not muslimists derp ** you wan na know how many illegal mexicans are in texas ? 
  about 1.7 million . 
  you wan na know texas ' population ? 
  27 million . 
  can you fucking imagine if poland , at 38.5 million , had 1.7 million illegal immigrants ? 
  holy shit the freak-out . 
  trust me , saying you 're anti-immigrant makes you sound just as much of an insufferable asshole as saying you 're anti-refugee does . 
  i can imagine exactly zero scenarios where someone says `` i 'm anti-immigrant '' or `` i 'm anti-refugee '' in real life where i do n't want to puke out a bill of rights or some shit 5 minutes later . 
  he actually has a record backing him up , unlike trump so that seems pretty diddily-iddily darn unlikely . 
   conflict zones syria was an extremely safe place before assad started murdering peaceful protestors . 
  i do n't know if you know much about mexico , but `` conflict zone '' barely scratches the surface . 
   pretty traumatized lol , isis is gon na have to step up its fucking game if it wants to be half as traumatizing as the cartels . 
  the worst those guys do is decapitate , which is almost absurdly mild by cartel standards . 
   little educated syrians , while typically not having an equivalent of american college education , are particularly well educated compared to their cousins from other parts of the world . 
  mexican illegals almost always end up as labor hands and are not known for their higher education whatsoever . 
   honor cultures i take it the entirety of your knowledge about syrian culture comes from the back of a neo-nazi cereal box or something ? 
   lawless environments top kek . 
  top kek all around . 
  there are many lawful environments in syria ; the exact opposite . 
  fsa ; isis , assad ; all of these are lawful environments . 
  just like the cartel/mafia in mexico . 
  the problem is that the laws are absolute shit , not that there are n't any . 
  trust me , you do n't wan na end up in the `` lawless '' parts of mexico . 
   already extremely conservative environments oh , right . 
  because fucking low-income catholic mexicans are known for their undying loyalty to liberalism and support for progressive social causes . 
  give me a fucking break . 
   social state in a western country with welfare , minimum wage and medic care it 's gon na costs a lot while gaining nothing . 
  ** why would you have social welfare programs if they are not meant to be used ?
