  ** seriously ; do you just imagine immigrants staying on welfare for their entire lives or some stupid shit like that ? 
  if given the chance , the less educated ones will get jobs in low-level labor . 
  they 'll spend a shitload on taxes and spend the rest of their money on shit they need , which stimulates the economy . 
  and guess what !, 
  pretty much all of europe 's population is in freefall !, 
  so unless you start popping boner pills right this second , you 're gon na need a lot of low-level tax payers to ease the burden of an aging population . 
  let me ask you ; would you prefer a dollar today , or two hundred dollars in a year ? 
  ** these fucking programs exist to help people become productive . 
  ** gfdi, 
  smart does n't mean you should have faith he 'll be a good leader . 
  what if he 's not just pretending to be a republican ? 
  what if the obscurity he hides his platform behind is to hide the fact that he does n't * have * a comprehensive platform ? 
  sounds like almost entirely conjecture tbh , which is probably not the most dazzling attribute for a candidate to have . 
  i see it as the significantly more evil to the lesser evil of not murdering them . 
  : / compared to other multicultural places , and places with a significant amount of immigrants , this shit just seems outrageously petty . 
  the us has 11 million illegals and 350m people . 
  europe has ... a few million illegals , less than even turkey , and 500m people . 
  time , as always , will march past the senseless panicking . 
  this shit 's almost as bad as the red scare and thankfully is not replicated in the real world . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_refugee_population sort by `` natives per refugee '' ; sweden tops the eu at # 14 and 107 natives per refugee , which means all of europe has more than 100 natives per refugee ... which means the refugees are less than 1 % of the population everywhere in europe . 
  yeah , you 'll have to forgive me if i 'm not as horrified as the rest of this stinking sub . 
  would it change your mind if most of what he 's said is extremely anti-immigration ? 
  i 'm not going to exaggerate at all ; this sub is more opposed to immigration than him . 
   more guns ai n't gunna solve yer migrant problem . 
  jesus fucking christ why is everyone being so goddamned pedantic over such a fucking minor and insignificant thing seriously you know ** very goddamned well ** what the point i was making was , yet all of you still decided to take the pedantic route instead of actually addressing the fucking point, 
   yeah , they actually count less since they 're basically your neighbours you 're gon na have to expand on that point because frankly ; who gives a shit ? 
  for much of history , being neighbors was a cause of * tension * , not a cause of friendship . 
  border disputes , domestic affairs , ** immigration . 
  **  immigrant too , just like them . 
  right . 
  a lot of our ancestors were just people who thought europe was a complete shithole , but again ; who gives a shit ? 
  are americans just inherently more friendly and welcoming than europeans ? 
   by the way , they 're already there , we have immigrants too who live here for decades , so no they do n't count . 
  i take it you do n't really know anything about the mexican immigration * crisis . 
  * : /  the uscis last released numbers for march ( arround 15k people i think ) thats almost the same as germany took in over the course of 2 weeks . 
  if i were the `` united states citizenship and immigration services '' i 'd stop releasing those numbers too because they 're ridiculously small . 
  so the refugees in europe just need to wait it out , is that right ? 
  you wo n't have this complaint once they 've lived in germany for `` decades '' ? 
   what not means taking people who have a completely different lifestyle . 
  i take it you do n't know much about mexico at all . 
  it 's not america with spanish subtitles , brother . 
   means taking people who have a completely different lifestyle . 
  some women tries to find you a cheap flat to rent ? 
  `` no '' problem solved !, 
   this is an actually clash of cultures . 
  i 'll bet $ 100 you ca n't find a massive immigration movement where people * did n't * complain about it being a `` clash of cultures '' oh ; wait . 
  it does n't fucking exist . 
  it 's just the dogwhistle of xenophobes throughout * literally * all of recorded history . 
  fucking german barbarians !, 
  they do n't belong in roman culture !, 
  they can never be real americans like us beautiful anglos !, 
  no such thing . 
  morocco , algeria , and tunisia are populated entirely by the maghrebi ... are you seriously gon na get outdone on cultural tolerance by fucking ** algeria ** buddy ? 
  kurds and iraqis can never not try to murder each other !, 
  that 's it !, 
  several centuries is more than enough !, 
  we * must * kick the muslim tartars out of lithuania !, 
  basque living amongst spaniards ? 
  do n't make me laugh . 
  mexico is a failed state : ethnic europeans can not live with native populations * or * mixed populations . 
  same logic applies to every where in central america . 
  and south america . 
  and the caribbean . 
  most of the pacific islands too . 
  parts of north america . 
  the war in south sudan is literally just about ethnicity , right ? 
  derp derp derp do you even know what a fucking india * looks * like ? 
  there are over two thousand fucking ethnicity in that country with a shitload less personal space and you 're whining over only a couple ? 
  really , dude ? 
  no ; seriously ; i 'm gon na make that last point again . 
  study indian demographics . 
  your brain in particular will probably short circuit within about 15 minutes . 
   you said it would simply not work , which for germany it actually would since they 're pretty good at keeping walls and keeping people inside/outside of walls . 
  the burden is on you to explain how a wall that covered a part of a war-ravaged city in europe is in ** any way ** translatable to building massive impenetrable walls across thousands of miles of geographical borders in a setting where the fucking ocean is also a factor . 
  these people are being extremely literal and nitpicky and it 's really annoying . 
  : / `` guns are n't gon na solve this problem '' `` well , ** technically , ** '' technically who gives a fucking shit omfg technically murdering innocent immigrants is an inherently shitty idea that 's not even worth the piss in my bladder and does n't deserve to even be entertained . 
  dude do you really wan na fucking do this do you really want to get down to the absolute purest technicalities and implied meaning and bullshitbullshitbullshit about such a minor and insignificant thing i 'm sorry if i seem agitated , because i absolutely am and you do n't deserve that . 
  i 'm getting so fucking sick and tired of the nit-picking and technical responses here tbh . 
  you know the us has 11 million illegal immigrants right ? 
  or are syrians , eritrians , afghanis , and iraqis just * super * immigrants that take 10x as much effort and yet have half the wall-jumping skills of mexican immigrants ? 
  a wall 's a shitty idea over here , a wall was a * super * shitty idea in berlin , and a wall is a shitty idea now . 
   just saying that the statement that using guns would not help is n't a correct statement . 
  there 's that `` extremely narrow perspective '' i was talking about . 
   :( i 'm not fucking interested in making a technical argument about the benefits of massacring innocent people being a benefit to an immigration crisis , sorry , i 'm interested in the whole picture . 
  i am not and have not been talking about the immigration issue in a pure vacuum , but that seems to be literally the only thing people here are concerned about . 
  : / c'mon , man , this is frustrating . 
  did the '' ** you 're right , but ** '' not suggest anything there ? 
  i agree that murdering migrants would * help * the immigration issue in a vacuum , then quickly * got back on topic . 
   only sheer distance works . 
  i did n't say the would n't avoid the country ; i said that the migrant problem would n't be solved . 
  that 's twice this has happened . 
  : s yes ; massacring innocent people * would * deter immigration , in the same way that syria massacring innocent people deters immigration . 
  there 's no way a fucking genocidal-like immigration policy is going to solve these problems in a way that makes anyone except the neo-nazis happy . 
  why is this idea even entertained ?? 
  for all the good stuff the un does , they ar truly the unsung hero of our era . 
  * sigh * no matter . 
  humanitarianism does n't require fame . 
  we 're talking about massacring minorities on a large enough scale that it becomes a significant deterrent towards more immigration ... which is probably just about the level where people get sincerely compared to hitler . 
  thankfully , yeah , anybody seriously suggesting `` just shoot them all '' is a lunatic that lives far far outside reality . 
  somehow i doubt the un would ignore 5,000 dead immigrants in vienna .
