  well ; who else is offering solutions ? 
  who else is acknowledging the fact that mass immigration ** is ** a current reality , ** will continue to be ** a reality , and has a solid plan for dealing with them ? 
  it 's not like germany is seen as a `` leader '' because they 've got knives at everyone 's throats . 
  germany to those people is leading by * example * , not by force . 
  what exactly are the repercussions for going against germany on this issue , anyway ? 
  person at the podium shouts `` we need to take care of a problem '' -- that 's not undemocratic , really . 
  it seems like kind of a wishy-washy argument , though there could obviously be some hidden depth to it . 
  * is * there any force that germany is opaquely displaying against other eu nations ? 
  here 's my guess . 
  someone did some analysis , found that about 800 k migrants are coming to germany or w/e , told merkel , who then said `` we 're gon na deal with 800k migrants '' . 
  same guy does analysis for like , finland . 
  tells merkel they 're gon na get 30k refugees or w/e . 
  merkel says `` finland needs to deal with 30k people '' . 
  there are n't any `` other means '' in relation to `` go or get murdered '' because it 's a constant threat . 
  you 're talking about yanking people out of cars and shooting them in the head when they look foreign and do n't have the right id . 
  your dad 's syrian and you forgot your driver 's license ? 
  bang , dead . 
  you 're brown and found a racist troop ? 
  bang , dead . 
  you 're in a crowd of syrians protesting the brutal massacre of innocent civilians ? 
  bang , dead . 
  no , i do n't think any rational person would respond to 20 or so cops going off and murdering 100 people at train station . 
  i honestly think the problems with that should be self-evident . 
  : / being an immigrant does n't warrant the death penalty . 
  turning european countries into syria to prevent immigration is n't a solution for anybody except the most wretched lunatics . 
  you 're right , but only in a very narrow perspective . 
  it might deter immigrants , but it wo n't stop them , and it 'll create ** much ** bigger problems . 
  even those bloody yanks generally know better than to just gun down people at the border . 
  take it from a burgerman more guns ** might very well solve the issue of immigration , and only immigration ** , but it will also cause a shitload of massive problems that are even worse edited for clarity . 
  why do n't we take it down a notch there buddy i 'm gon na ask like 3 questions and we 're gon na try not to turn it into a shitfest ok ? 
  would you say that merkel is/has been doing more or less than her contemporaries in the eu leadership ? 
  do you think that migrants are simply never going to be contributing members of the economy ? 
  do you think a dollar today is worth more than 5 dollars in a year ? 
  no those are * good * minorities . 
  it 's impossible to stop the refugees from coming . 
  walls are n't going to do it , and guns are n't going to do it ; only sheer distance works . 
  turkey and germany are both within walking distance of syria and iraq ; the former much so . 
  merkel 's praise comes from here recognizing and understanding these facts ... and not being kind of a bitch about it . 
  `` okay . 
  we 're about to get a ton of refugees and there 's no easy or humane way to stop them , so let 's get to work eh '' kinda mentality that this sub * probably * does n't agree with . 
  it 's a well known fact that mexicans are an unusual sight in south texan walmarts . 
  * nods idiotically *, 
  right , but they 're the minority , like natives in the americas . 
   the only reasonable/permanent option is to rid the world of the religion itself . 
  you 're not gon na convert a billion and a half people to atheismo without several genocides , so yeah , you were implicitly supporting genocides . 
  canada 's definitely in an interesting position with an interesting philosophy . 
  benefits of the ocean and no unstable borders whatsoever , but they also have that whole `` mosaic '' identity . 
  heck , even mexico has that old `` the spanish fucked the maya and created the mexicans '' joke ... and , of course , the americas are sometimes more tolerant of immigrants , being made up almost entirely of them . 
  [ sometimes . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/er5c3zj.jpg ) the idea of an ethnic state is probably pretty foreign to ... most people , now that i think about it . 
  we could 've split india into 5 massive countries if we were going with that line of thinking , or just as easily a few dozen , as it was before english rule ... not to mention malaysia , indonesia , russia , just a ton of african states ... really , i guess the idea of an ethnicity defining a country is foreign to everyone except europeans and , idk far easterners ? 
  i mean , fuck me , even morocco/algeria/tunisia have had the berbers living among them for centuries . 
  though i 'm pretty sure most of this sub is opposed to multiculturalism on principle , so it unfortunately does n't really matter that much to them . 
  german again . 
  why does everyone keep using german sources ? 
  my german 's not good enough for this shit . 
  worse yet , there 's a giant pop-up , and the text is super faded , so i ca n't even not read the german . 
  i 'm looking for something * credible * , you know ? 
  not huffingtonpost or telegraph anecdote bullshit . 
  like , a government report that can convincingly link increased muslim immigration with a significant spike in crime . 
  census reports . 
  shit like that . 
  actual well-done statistics . 
  i hope it 's not considered a rhetorical device to ask for non-shit sources that ... that are also english . 
   if isis wants to bomb us we wo n't make it easy for them . 
  that necessitates limiting your liberties !, 
   imaginary ? 
  are turks fighting kurds an imagination ? 
  was this beheading of soilder in london imaginary ? 
  are muslims zones in sweden an imagination ? 
  or maybe killing journalist in france was not a real thing ? 
  i dont think so . 
  there are almost * certainly * a thousand things that will kill you in england , sweden , or france before an islamist will kill you , but you 're not even half as terrorized about those things as you are muslims . 
  i 'm betting sharks are , again , a much bigger threat than muslims . 
  are you gon na outlaw beaches ? 
   people 's movement is more dangerous than terrorism ? 
  lel , sure okey . 
  again do n't force us perspective upon europe since your country was founded on completely different grounds and beliefs . 
  the point there was that a secular movement is almost infinitely more threatening than islamist attacks . 
  again ; there are at least a thousand things that are more likely to kill either of us anywhere in europe or the us than muslim terrorists , but your fear is being extremely disproportionately funneled into muslims ... which , unironically , ** is exactly what isis wants from you . 
  **  not really , i am more convinced that they will basing on other european countries . 
  it is more of centrainty . 
  you 're scared of what they ** could ** do to you . 
  that 's why you 're promoting the xenophobia . 
   and we are far from xenophobia , in my opinion . 
  we have vietnameese community which we respect . 
  liking one fucking ethnicity does n't exclude you from being mindlessly hateful of others !!!, 
  if i say i like asians but hate blacks , that makes me a racist , no ifs ands or buts . 
   not liking islam is n't xenophobia since islam creates more problems than solutions in europe . 
  it is calld being rational in here . 
  harmful ideologies should not be imported to europe . 
  here 's a quick question ; which do the refugees value more ; their religion , or european opportunity/welfare ? 
  where do you * really * think their priority lies ? 
  ... and what about native muslims in poland ? 
  tartars and all that who 've been a part of your country for centuries ? 
  you hate them , too ? 
   it is calld being rational in here . 
  harmful ideologies should not be imported to europe . 
  then i should warn you ; there 's no fucking thing such as `` moderate '' nationalism . 
   i believe that they culture is too far from ours for them to coexist with polish catholics in numbers eu wants us to .
