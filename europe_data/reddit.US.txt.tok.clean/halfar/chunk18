  it 's fine if you think that the numbers are too big , and we can disagree with each other fairly on that issue , but are you really just inherently opposed to the concept of fraternity and egalitarianism ? 
  are n't those the blocks upon which poland joined left the soviet union and joined the eu ? 
  the eu was built to unite europe , not to split it in half , which why including easten europe ... and poland ... was so critical . 
  it has a significant bond with the us , canada , nz , and australia , as well , but the fear of division is still almost belligerently obvious . 
  are we uniting people under the nato/eu banner , or are we just splitting the world in half , which is the exact opposite of the eu 's goal ? 
   well the videos are pretty self explaining they really really really really really really are not . 
  videos are a complete and utter shit news source ... but the articles seem decent enough . 
  thanks for them . 
  gives me a little bit to read about . 
  are there any names besides grey wolf i should look into , or background/historical context of the current issue type stuff ? 
  you said this was 2nd + generation turks/kurds fighting ; anything about how these dumbasses end up fighting in the streets of germany , or is it kinda similar to how 2nd/3rd generation disenfranchised muslims get radicalized by isis ? 
  erm , sorry , do you have any * english * sources ? 
  my german 's not good enough for this . 
  well , okay dick , i 'll just ask the same question again , since my criticism of your point still stands in that the source you brought up , the op , did n't answer this question :  do you have any statistics that show immigrants as an extremely dangerous source of rape and murder ? 
   sure it does , but why do n't we hear about polish terrorists attack ? 
  what do you think ? 
  again , excluding the 9/11 attacks ** 14 years ago ** , what instances of major terrorism have happened in the us ? 
  if we 're going by cold hard numbers , we should be more scared of shark attacks in utah than terrorists . 
  seriously ; how can you possibly so scared of such an imaginary insignificant threat ? 
  there 's nothing stopping them from attacking poland now ; what changes once they become immigrants ? 
  if isis wants a bomb in poland , it does n't matter how draconian their immigration laws are ; they 're gon na bomb you . 
   lack of muslims might be one of few things ** smh ** we have way more muslims in the us per capita , but we are n't constantly being attacked by terrorists . 
  you know why ? 
  ** because muslims are n't inherently terrorists . 
  **  are muslims prone to terrorism ? 
  this would be an interesting question . 
  they 're sure as fucking shit more prone to hate crimes than white people , which is `` terrorism '' from a muslim perspective . 
  you know what 's infinitely more dangerous than islamists in america ? 
  the sovereign citizen movement . 
  biggest cop killers in the country . 
   no i am no afraid . 
  i am cautious because i have nothing to fear . 
  i am sitting in one of the safest countries in the world and i like it . 
  i want to keep it that way , because why would i risk changing it ? 
  ** that is being afraid of them . 
  you are afraid that they will damage your safety . 
  ** ( \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f \u253b \u2501 \u253b  they are not my people . 
  if you are so open minded take those refugees to your home , do n't impose them on others . 
  can you at least fucking admit that this is nothing but xenophobia ??? 
  what about poles in the uk ? 
  you think they should get kicked out ? 
  poles are n't the uk 's `` people '' , after all ? 
   again , we care more about people who live inside our borders . 
  let 's make one thing perfectly fucking clear , because i see this a fucking ton here . 
  ** nobody ** no , wait , let 's do that again . 
  ## ** nobody ** is saying that immigrants should be a higher priority than natural citizens . 
  ** nobody ** is doing that . 
  ** again ## ** nobody is saying that we should prioritize the welfare of refugees over native citizens . 
  nobody 's doing that !, 
  not a single person i 'm aware of is saying anything even remotely like that . 
  you 're fully capable of taking care of both your natural citizens and refugees ; there are n't ** any ** rules that say it 's one or the other . 
  the narrative you 're suggesting is n't the same argument that the article is making , though . 
   `` the police have reached their absolute breaking point , '' said mr radek . 
  `` our officials are increasingly being called to confrontations in refugee homes . 
  when there are 4,000 people in a home which only actually has places for 750 , this confinement then leads to aggression where even a tiny thing like the corridor to the toilet can lead to violence . '' this is very different from the argument that migrants are inherently rapist murderers , or lead to massive spikes in either . 
  honestly , if this argument were really that straight forward it 'd be easy as piss to see it as a demographic graph . 
  all we get are singular anecdotes on tangential content . 
  it 's gon na be a little rough while shit gets organized , no shit , but that 's no reason to abandon the effort all together . 
   `` there is a potential for a backlash against the ** vast majority ** of law abiding citizens from asian/pakistani communities from other members of the community believing their children have been exploited . 
  so you 've given me a source that 's explicitly talking about a vast minority ... and i 'm to take it as an example of the majority or something ? 
  you * should * be smarter than using anecdotes , anyways . 
  i 'm not talking about specific news sources which corroborate with nationalism/xenophobia , man . 
  that article tells me more about the shifting attitude of the uk police than asian immigrant as a whole . 
  give me big numbers . 
  demographics . 
  rapes instantly spiking after a city takes in 100 refugees . 
  that sorta thing . 
  i 'm having a little trouble finding concrete numbers that exclude ukraine but include places like eritrea & afghanistan , tbh , but unhcr lists the `` people of concern '' in poland at just under 30k , so i guess a significant chunk , if not most of those people ? 
  i 'll gladly admit that the refugees mostly would prefer germany to poland ... but that just plays even more into my `` they 're going for opportunities , not for taking over '' argument . 
  so what 's stopping a polish person from doing something that would make people call him a terrorist if he were muslims ? 
  i 'm no expert , but i 'm * pretty * sure that a polish person 's bullet can kill you just as dead as a muslim 's bullet . 
  are you just scared shitless of * everyone ? 
  *  the thing is , we dont need surveillance and limitation of privacy and yet we are pretty safe the 9/11 attacks are the ** one ** example of a significant terrorist attack in the us . 
  if you take it away , we 're just as fucking safe as anywhere else in the world . 
  what , realistically , is * currently * stopping a terrorist attack in poland ? 
  is poland stopped from terrorists attacks by pure magic ? 
  are immigrants somehow the only people capable of murder and terrorism ? 
   we are not afraid because we do n't need to be you 're so afraid you 're literally labeling all muslim immigrants as potential terrorists !, 
  that 's the * epitome * of political terror !, 
   you dont need to limit freedom and maitain safety when you live among your people . 
  ** you are talking about doing exactly that by having a prejudiced immigration policy . 
  do you have any statistics that show immigrants as an extremely dangerous source of rape and murder ? 
  because baby i 've heard this story before . 
  ** i am asking for opinions . 
  so , essentially , it seems as though all of your opposition towards immigration is the fear of terrorism . 
  is that really how you want to live your life ? 
  some years ago , we had a few thousand people murdered in the biggest terrorist attack of our era . 
  it led us to two pointless wars and a significant decline in our civil liberties . 
  we did not make the right choice . 
  i do n't see how you can agree with what we did unless you 're so scared of terrorists that you 're willing to label ** all ** muslims as terrorists , support the nsa , a polish nsa , losing your right to privacy , and building a surveillance state . 
  is that really the world where you want your children to grow ? 
  to be suspicious of another person through pure prejudice ? 
  xenophobia like that wo n't make terrorism disappear ; it 'll do just the opposite . 
  driving a wedge between brothers will only create more hate in the world , not dismiss it . 
  the only thing we have to fear is fear itself . 
  you were asking me for a single fucking example !, 
  `` how many years do you expect immigrants to take for integration ? '', 
  `` which immigrants and where ? '', 
  `` uhh , these ones '' `` what about the rest of them '' fucking seriously dude ? 
  you asked me for parameters with which you could answer the question , then immediately frame it as though i 'm trying to cherry pick or something ?
