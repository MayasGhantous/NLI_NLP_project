   noone says otherwise . 
  you must be talking about a different sub . 
   i just state that they should not be accepted here since it takes muslims even few generations to fully integrate so it 's impatience ? 
  should every nation turn back immigrants because full integration might take more than a generation ? 
   ( looking at kuro-turkish fights lately in germany ) . 
  you 're going to have to expand on that more in order to make a coherent point ; which 2nd or 3rd generation kurds and turks are fighting , where , and what are the actual underlying reasons behind it ? 
   i mean why would i risk my country getting additional problems with muslims ? 
  the same reason you have social welfare in the first place , in that poverty does not know race or creed and all people deserve help when they need it most ? 
  the fact that poland has a shrinking population and is going to need low-class immigrant labor in order to pick up the tax burden as the population gets older ? 
  the fact that you can address more than one problem at a time ? 
  the fact that they 're ** going ** to come to your country no matter ( they 're literally risking death ) what and need to be dealt with , one way or another ? 
  the fact that there 's no good reason european values should end at the border ? 
  the fact that most of europe was in an extremely similar situation like half a century ago ? 
  the fact that they 'll become consumers and producers of your country and make * everyone * a little bit more wealthy if you give them the chance ? 
  the fact that , if they end up as low-income workers , which is likely , most of their income will go back into the economy and boost it even further , letting the native population reap the higher class benefits ? 
  the fact that ** they want to become european ** , and you do n't ^ should n't want to live in an exclusionary society ? 
  hurray !, 
  they 're just like the fucking rest of us then . 
  c : immigrants come to europe for better opportunities that will keep them from extreme poverty while they build a new life ^ ( ( read : money ) ^ ) and europeans will whine that they do n't have * quite * as much money as they had before and have to share it with war-stricken refuge -- i 'm sorry , i mean war-stricken welfare queens . 
  let 's go with syrians in germany to keep it vaguely simple, 
  * sigh * no . 
  it suggests that they are willing to `` abandon '' their culture because they see european opportunities as being much more worthwhile . 
  people are acting like the immigrants do n't want to / will refuse to / ca n't possibly integrate , which is just fucking stupid . 
  if integration really were something they would permanently be incapable of , they * would * go to other middle eastern countries that * kinda * have a similar culture . 
  your opinion is n't going to change theirs , and the fact that they 're choosing your nation over nations more similar to theirs suggests ** something ** , does n't it ? 
  like , real talk here . 
  if the immigrants really valued their religion/extremism or what the fuck ever more than the opportunities europe can provide ... would n't they be going to the places that share a religion with them ? 
  which is an answer to a question i was n't asking . 
  ** obviously ** you 'd hope for refugees to not be actively violent towards the citizens helping them out , but ...  so much for ** integration ** ... lol . 
  germans have seen nothing yet . 
  integration into a new society is an ** entirely ** separate thing . 
  i do n't think i was wrong to assume the guy addressing a question about integration was talking about integration being a 0 year process . 
    how many years do you expect integration to take , on average ? 
   0 , when you go in a country to ask for their help you 'd better accept their traditions and not be violent . 
  maybe you misinterpreted my question , and actually answered some completely unrelated question ? 
  it was `` how long do you expect integration to take , on average '' , not `` how long do you expect non-violence and acceptance of a country 's traditions to take , on average '' . 
  unless integration literally just means not raping and shouting slurs at citizens to you or something ? 
  ahhhh hahahahahahaha oh my god that 's fucking funny in such a sad way . 
  it 's that easy , is it ? 
  well gods why did n't anyone tell me `` shit !, 
  civil war has quite suddenly descended onto our country . 
  it does n't look like it 's going to end soon . 
  i 've lost my job and my home but i need to protect my family 's future . 
  france seems like the best opportunity for me . '', 
  `` if i am literally ever going to become a full french person , i need to master the language , history , and culture before i even arrive at the border ... but i do n't have the years available for schooling , education , and i ca n't immerse myself in french culture while in syria with isis knocking at my doorstep trying to conscript me !, 
  whatever shall i do ? '', 
  i know !, 
  i 'll just take my fuckity doo france pill !, 
  * gulp * ** zip zop zoopity i 'm french now !, 
  ** now i can immigrate to france without people talking shit about me on the internet !, 
  thank goodness the process of integration is so quick and simple , or else i would have had some real trouble there . '', 
  like dude how can you seriously say something like `` integration of a person into an entirely new society takes literally no time at all '' with a straight face ? 
  i 'm not even being fucking rhetorical here ; how could you ever arrive at such a. . . mindless fucking conclusion ? 
  how can you even pretend that your argument is n't just a vehicle for xenophobic rhetoric and that you * actually believe * integration is an immediate thing ? 
  that 's most definitely an extremist/radical view to have . 
  you 'd make fast friends with our neo-nazi friends at / r/european . 
  how many years do you expect integration to take , on average ? 
  the dutch have always hated the ocean, 
  that 's literally the exact opposite of reasonable, 
  is finally ewa kopacz time of shine ? 
  does n't the eu have more than 500 million people ? 
  no , no . 
  that makes too much sense . 
  clearly they 've just been mooching off 1st world aid enough to have their populations explode . 
  do you think they were actually being serious with the proposal ? 
  i do n't know much about domestic hungarian politics . 
  is n't having your nationality defined by your ethnicity kind of a terrible idea ? 
  i mean , take france . 
  why ca n't `` liberty , equality , and fraternity '' be their national identity ? 
  what does the us have that allows it a non-race based identity that other nations do n't have or ca n't get ? 
  man , you would look like such a racist in america if you said a black guy could n't really be american . 
  got pretty fucking quiet , did n't it ? 
  stop and frisk , for one . 
  i 'm so fuck and sick and tired of this false equivalency retarded shit . 
  it 's possibly the stupidest fucking bullshit of this entire fucking election . 
  anybody who seriously thinks they 're both `` just as bad '' needs to go shove their head right up their fucking asses where they belong . 
  it 's not a thought i can seriously consider because it 's just fucking idiotic at every single spot . 
  it does n't even try to make sense . 
  it 's a toddler applying a generalized feeling of what their parents think of politics . 
  they 're voting for trump because they 're fucking shitheads . 
  i 'm sick of trying to give them the benefit of the doubt . 
  they are n't voting for him because of me , and if they are , that 's still fucking idiotic beyond belief . 
  i 'm so fucking sick and tired of acting like they do n't hate everything and everyone i care about . 
  i 'm so fucking sick and tired of pretending like racism is n't the absolute root of what they 're doing , and that they 're `` just concerned for poor lil working class americans !, 
  i 'm so sick fucking tired of every single one of their stupid fucking excuses and lies . 
  they are n't fucking rational . 
  all of the people i care about are scared . 
  i 'm done giving those ratfucker republicans the benefit of the doubt after they voted for this shitstain of a human being . 
  they 're just fucking horrible people . 
  i 'm so fucking sick and tired of trying to give them civility and basic courtesy when i know they 'll never return even one fucking billionth of it back to me . 
  i 'm fucking sick and tired of pretending like reagan was n't an abomination because i wanted to encourage healthy discourse . 
  i fucking hate their ignorance and how much pride they take in being stupid pieces of shit . 
  i 'll be charitable and say it 's because about 90 % of turkey or whatever is n't in europe . 
  still tho, 
  good , good . 
  trees take a lot longer to grow than plants . 
  looks like things are on the up and up over there . 
  * nods intelligently *, 
  ouch this sub used to be pretty ... liberal with what `` europe '' means . 
  even azerbaijan used to be on the little graphic in the topright .
