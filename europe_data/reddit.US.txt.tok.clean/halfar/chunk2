  i have a solution portugal will be portuguese a and brazil will be portuguese 1, 
  now you 're starting to sound more like us . 
  * tears of pride *, 
  i 'm surprised you did n't lash out at your country being called `` holland '' followed by the obligatory `` it 's two provinces '' lecture .

  the only thing waiting for them past the iraqi and syrian kurds are ... * the turkish kurds * . 
  they 've got no chance .

  rehashing means you 'd use an old joke in a new way , which obviously does n't happen for most reddit jokes , especially `` latvia does n't have potatoes hurdur '' . 
  the us will annex switzerland before we allow you europeans to get your grubbly little fingers all over it . 
  apparently continents are defined by you , and you alone , and convention and common use do n't matter . 
  the urals are n't a single mountain range . 
  they 're a huge solid line that literally go straight down russia . 
  the ural mountain range create a * huge * watershed drain divide between ** europe ** and ** asia ** . 
  it 's like the rocky mountains in the us : it divides the watersheds into pacific and atlantic drain points . 
  it 's obviously a whole fuck lot more than an `` arbitrary line '' . 
  and since when do n't we let natural borders define political borders ? 
  italy 's northern border is defined by the alps : arbitrary line [ here 's an image of us states that have borders defined by rivers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:us_states_riverine_borders.jpg ) the rhine between france and germany ; completely and utterly arbitrary and , obviously , as the other guy said , tectonic plates do n't define continents . 
  the urals ? 
  ... aaaaand it 's almost as if you 'd expect the same group of people to vote the same way over a period of time . 
  of course they have secessionist movements . 
  the image did n't intend to list * all * european secessionist movements . 
  you do n't have to like our name , but you also do n't have to be so mean to us . 
  mostly none of what you just said was reflected in what you said the first time , though i guess that makes sense . 
  not that i remember what exactly it said before you edited it , but whatever . 
  you certainly could have been more precise/accurate than `` this comic is about * american * anarchists '' , and we both know that . 
  only americans use tumbr . 
  got it . 
  did n't you dudes already try that ? 
  motherfucker i believe in judging a man by the * content of his character * , not by stereotypes , assumptions , religion , or skin color . 
  i 'm not going to say that someone 's probably * a fucking rapist * because they 're syrian . 
  do you think rape is just legal/encouraged in syria or some retarded shit like that ? 
  his fucking flair does n't discredit his point smh, 
  that still happens . 
  it 's just usually more subtle and ... often ... less violent . 
  you 're white culture , right ? 
  you do n't commit any crimes . 
  we should have mandatory strip searches for every single refugee every single day . 
  * european values . 
  do n't worry . 
  if your attitude is at all a representation of your culture , it 's also a steaming pile of shit . 
  i do n't get what the problem is . 
  ** their ** culture is just `` incompatible '' with ours . 
  that 's why we need strict segregation of cultures and nations . 
  these damn ~ ~ refugees ~ ~ ~ ~ migrants ~ ~ welfare queen rapists are going against the natural order by not being in their apocalyptic wasteland that they came from . 
  see , you think that there 's only one kind of human being , but the truth is that there are like ... four or five . 
  whites , which are best , asians , which are okay i guess idk , blacks , whatever , and islamist radicals . 
  it 's like dogs and cats . 
  you ca n't have a dog and a cat living under the same roof . 
  the clear and obvious solution is to send them back to syria , obviously . 
  and if the government wo n't send the message by violating its most sacred values of stupid shit like liberty , equality , and brotherhood , well , someone else has got to step up for them . 
  everyone in this sub is totting around about how fucking great european culture or whatever is , but their dehumanizing attitude suggests the exact opposite . 
  if `` european values '' constitutes murdering people without due process and building exclusionary xenophobic societies , then `` european values '' are worth less than the shit on my boot , and i say that with extreme discretion . 
  fighting , sometimes violently , against these refugees is * literally * a matter of life and death in their brains , somehow . 
  it 's ** exactly ** like when you hear stormfront arguing about `` the white genocide '' ... because it 's fucking literally the same thing . 
  you know what happened on reddit when osama was killed ? 
  `` we should n't celebrate his death , as horrible as he was '' . 
  even the fucking default subs on reddit had enough maturity to realize that glorifying and celebrating the death of their aggressors made them look somewhat hypocritical , and osama was n't did n't inspire half the hyperbolic terror that this place has been given . 
  `` if we let those refugees in our shitty european values will be destroyed forever ! '', 
  fuck this sub . 
  `` finland radicals burn down mosque and attack refugees '' `` hey , * somebody 's * got ta do it . '', 
  but what you 're arguing for is in strict contradiction with the whole `` nation-state '' bs . 
  egalitarianism/equality is an inherent part of your ubermensch cultural identity , is n't it ? 
  ... what ? 
  i ca n't even begin to comprehend what you just said . 
  like ; arab culture does n't exist , it 's just islam culture ... but arabs come from pretty much every religion under the sun ... so are middle eastern christians muslims , too ? 
  how fucking ignorant can you really get ? 
  that 's really impressive , but is that really the best you can do ? 
  what is going on here ? 
  it 's the whole point of `` isis '' as an identity . 
  they are an autocratic regime . 
  not an islamic caliphate . 
  i mean ; it 's the oldest fucking trick in the book . 
  branding . 
  everyone does it . 
  they are n't religious warriors , they 're just dickheads . 
  but the quarter-wits on this sub act like the quran is isis ' constitution or some shit and all muslims follow it . 
  have you just never heard the `` their culture is incompatible with ours '' line spouted on this sub before ? 
  the conflating of religion and culture is definitely another pain in the ass with this sub . 
  daesh has repeatedly said they 're going to take advantage of the refugee crisis to spread polarization . 
  `` facilitating '' , the word i use , is significantly different from `` orchestrating '' , and even that was just a very minor speculation on my part , i.e. 
  not the main point i was making . 
  daesh makes a killing in converting muslim europeans to grunt warriors ; that 's no secret . 
  the insane polarization is beneficial to the radicals in every single way . 
  my point to / r/europe is simple ; let them live as normal human beings , or they might be forced into becoming ... not normal human beings . 
  it 's not really a conspiracy ... that 's just standard middle eastern terrorist strategy . 
  daesh likely supports whatever drives the west against islam , not just refugees , and it 's not exactly a secret that daesh tries to manipulate muslim immigrants in europe into joining them by playing off european islamophobia .
