  but not really , since the whole peak population thing is still just a tangent to the main piece of this conversation . 
  i mean , we 've barely begun to begin vertical farming , and there 's still a lot more that gmos can do for us . 
  there 's a whole hell of a lot of potential for increasing farming output efficiency , even beyond what you mentioned . 
  as another tangent , i 'm wholy supportive of gmos . 
  we 've been fucking with our food growth since slightly before the dawn of civilization , and if it means fewer starving people , i 'm all game . 
   double the population and you have to cut that in half , double it again and you cut it in half again ... of course the problem is that a portion of this share is given over to other things beside food , such as power generation or making shoes ... yes , exponential growth is crazy , but it 's also getting thoroughly ahead of ourselves , like extrapolating one month of 10 % growth to fifty years of constant 10 % growth . 
  who knows how long it will take to double our population , and then quadruple it , and then 8x it ? 
  i do n't feel like that 's an urgent `` it 's already happening '' concern . 
  i do n't think we 're on the cusp of 64 billion people on this planet anytime soon , and i still do n't really have a good idea of where `` peak population '' might be . 
   i hate racist cretins but you portray it like they are n't many poles in the uk when nearly 1 in 60 people are polish with the vast majority coming to the uk in the last 12 years . 
  i think we 're talking about two different statistics ( total ethnic poles in uk vs number of polish-born poles in uk ) , but ... ... 
  does that sound like a lot ??!? 
  christ , imagine sixty people in a room , and one of them is polish . 
  how in god 's green earth is that overwhelming in any possible sense of the word ? 
  even just illegal mexicans in the us are at least double that ratio , and heavily concentrated in the southeast . 
  afaik , it seems like it 's just gon na end up with the status quo , except the uk will lose their eu vote at best ... which is dumb . 
  worse case scenario ... well , we can all use our imaginations , ca n't we ? 
  so here 's a question that 's been bugging me with the extreme rise of the alt-right and anti-immigration people the past year ; where exactly is that line ? 
  because , tbh , i 've never been particularly `` impressed '' by the scope of these mass immigrations . 
  the uk has a population of around 64 million , and has had a peak of about 400k polish-born workers in the past decade or so . 
  that 's , uh , not a particularly exciting percentage . 
  even less so when you consider all those `` we 're getting ethnically displaced and everything 's being taken over '' nuts . 
  what 's the deal ? 
  is it incredible sensationalism ? 
  i would n't believe it 's a highly localized issue , since it happens uniformly across countries , even in low-immigration areas . 
  it 's hard to find a sensible cause behind all of the outrage and anger that does n't boil down to the humanity-old hatred of immigrants . 
  idk . 
  i get the same feeling whenever people talk about the world being overpopulated . 
  i think they just * feel * like 8 billion is too big of a number , but do n't actually have any rationality or logic backing up what they think peak population might end up at . 
  was n't anti-eu ( specifically polish ) immigration a pretty big point of contention for the pro-brexit folk ? 
  by your powers combined, 
  do n't be so glum . 
  the eternal stalemate between sweden and denmark is crucially necessary towards protecting the wellbeing of norway , the nordic country the rest of us care about :-), 
  [ that 's a very thoughtful response ] ( http://media.giphy.com/media/hq4dyxhdkevhw/giphy.gif ), 
  did you just confuse the uk with the us ? 
  i mean , the uk * wanted * less wealth in this way of thinking . 
  can hardly hold that against the eu . 
  it should have never been a simple majority . 
  [ looks like they 're trying to use security as a bargaining chip ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/brexit-eu-condemns-mays-blackmail-over-security-cooperation ) another good reason why brexit is a terrible move . 
  toss it on the pile , i guess . 
  [ at least they are n't doing the haughty 80 's laugh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw1qy76d-40 ), 
  bu you 're irish so \u1555 ( \u141b ) \u1557, 
  is this one of those subs that start out as parody and satire and then morph into horrifyingly real, 
  so what you 're saying is , and please excuse me if i 'm just * completely * misreading your words , that scotland needs to be annexed by spain so they can stay in the eu until they figure out the whole independence thing, 
  let 's be real ; they 've been planning this since 1801, 
  dude no do n't antagonize the nazis, 
  what 's my ideology , cutie ? 
  that 's probably the most loaded question i 've heard all year , wow, 
  norway , denmark , finland , and sweden typically are n't noted for their historically friendly relationships lmao . 
  two of those four , probably denmark and sweden , have the record for most wars between two countries . 
  and , of course , not far behind them is france & england,

  cheeto benito, 
  uh oh is n't this how the troubles started ? 
  fuck dude ca n't you just be like `` stoopeed american why can ' y you learn another language '' or something this is weird i do n't know how to deal with this, 
  maybe the dutch just like using other peoples ' languages . 
  i mean , i do n't think you guys could ever roll as hard as english does ... but i think you could take a shot at french , and definitely swedish . 
  you guys do n't even have * your subreddit 's name * in your language . 
  / r/thenetherlands , not / r/nederland ?? 
  at least the folks in that sub are using dutch . 
  i feel like the dutch give up too easily on media/online language imperialism, 
  i do n't wan na blame it * all * on 9/11 , but, 
  the pyramids were closer in time to the moon landing than the moon landing is to the modern day !, 
  that sounds like some serious fucking nonsense obfuscation . 
  who is `` we '' ? 
  it 's a necessary burden to protect the interests of the minority . 
  then i 'll direct you to the hundred times i 've already answered . 
  the rules , which do n't actually exist , and which contradict the interpretations laid out before the referendum ... and it ** completely fucking was ** non-conclusive . 
  it was a 2 % difference between a majority and a minority . 
  that 's fucking * tiny . 
  * that 's way below the natural sway of public opinion . 
  you ca n't even fucking argue legitimately that it did n't go one way because of the fucking weather . 
  hillary clinton `` won '' by 2 % , how fucking conclusive do you think that was ? 
  you 're literally contradicting yourself ; a 2 % win is conclusive for leave , but not for clinton ? 
  what the fuck ever . 
  maybe try actually addressing my argument , instead of addressing some other argument ? 
  the threshold should be above what would be considered the potential natural sway of public opinion , so you 're not constantly switching between a `` remain majority '' and a `` leave majority '' -- when you completely fucking fuck up decades of foreign policy strategy !, 
  only make massive referendum decisions when the opinion of the majority is clear and unwavering !, 
  is the logic behind that really so incomprehensible ? 
  should such massive policy decisions really be made in the moments of fleeting 50 % +1 support ? 
  because that 's completely fucking idiotic , and a clear case of `` tyranny of the majority '' . 
  at least , when public opinion sways over a president , tipping him/her above or below 50 % again and again , we have a mechanism that can fix the problem fairly frequently ; we hold elections !, 
  every two years !, 
  it 's incredibly quick by democratic standards . 
  but you 're not seriously suggesting the eu gets a referendum every 4 years , so the comparison is complete fucking nonsense congrats that 's like a dozen fucking times i 've had to make this exact same argument it 's seriously a terrible comparison . 
  us presidents are * designed * to be replaced every 4 or 8 years . 
  eu memberships are not . 
  it 'd be much more fair to compare eu membership to any massive federal law in the us , which do n't get fucking put up to election every 4 years . 
  do british people vote on all of their laws every 4 years ? 
  then they are n't comparable to a us federal election . 
  replacing my argument with `` you 're american '' is not the same thing as actually addressing my fucking argument . 
  like how they retroactively changed it to being a binding , definite , extremely hard brexit , and completely dismissed their logic of `` if it 's 52-48 in favor of remain , that 's nonconclusive '' ? 
  okay sure fucking thing buddy, 
  ... . the three and a half damn hundred other comments below mine , the one you commented on . 
  it 's impossible that you missed all of them . 
  ugggh i * do not * feel like making this argument a 10th time . 
  read one of the other 10 threads i 've made my argument in . 
  * million * , not * millions .
