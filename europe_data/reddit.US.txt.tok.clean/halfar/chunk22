  * it was very close ; close enough to argue that the `` majority '' could switch , has switched , or will switched . 
  you could even argue that the weather changed the result . 
  my argument is that , for such an immense and important decision , the standard should be higher than an even 50 % -50 % split . 
  it should be a forceful and definitive enough result that the `` majority '' opinion is immune to the natural sway of public opinion . 
  a supermajority . 
   say brexit required a 70 % majority that 's ridiculously high . 
  60 % is probably as high as i 'd personally put it , and i 'll admit even that 's on the high side . 
  the idea is to set the bar just barely * higher * than how public/partisan opinion might sway over time , and only on major issues that ca n't be readdressed every 2/4 years . 
   most decisions in a democracy ca n't be flipped on and off like a light switch . 
  a lot of them can , kinda . 
  it 's why the us has federal elections every 2 years ; to be able to constantly swing with the change in public opinion ... but that 's not something even remotely comparable to a massive trade deal like eu membership . 
  i mean , fuck , are n't you people estimating it 'll take more than 2 years to even make it happen in the first place ? 
  i feel like the disparity is obvious . 
   you ca n't enter a war one week and try to withdraw the next , you ca n't build nuclear plants one month and then tear them down for solar the next month . 
  should we have a bigger majority than 50 % on any big decision ? 
  i feel like you were trying to make a counter-argument , but it sounds like you were just making my argument for me ?? 
  yes , abso-fucking-goddamn-shitting-obviously-lutely we should have more than 50 % +1 support to start a war . 
  and not * any * big decision , just long-lasting controversial decisions . 
  a nuclear plant is a pretty permanent consideration , so yes , it should n't be based on the whims of a single day of 50 % +1 support , since support could easily fall after that . 
   and whether you say yes or no , this is something that absolutely had to be decided before the vote happened - changing the goalposts afterwards is completely undemocratic . 
  the logic still stands . 
  you should n't be making massive decisions that are precipitated on `` the will of the majority '' ... when you do n't even fucking know what the will of the majority is . 
  you caught me ; i am indeed making the argument that the referendum was held irresponsibly . 
  that 's not exactly a controversial opinion , either . 
   so where were all the people arguing this point before brexit ? 
  i never saw a one . 
  bitch i do n't know what cereal boxes you were reading about brexit from i ca n't answer that for you  the status quo side loses and suddenly the vote ought to have been massively rigged in favor of the status quo this one time - okay then . 
  if you 're suggesting that i 'm only making this argument because i did n't like the results , well , i guess all i can say is go fuck yourself , you 're wrong ? 
  my argument is based on my support for the concept of how the us constitution is written and amended . 
  that 's not something that 's only developed because of the brexit referendum . 
   let 's have the next international agreement that people hope will bring them economic and political union require a 70 % margin to enter into - i 'm sure everyone will be behind that . 
  you 're implicitly suggesting i 'm making an argument in bad faith , and yet insist on acting like this 70 % strawman is my legitimately held position ? 
  that 's not my position , and you saying otherwise is n't going to change that . 
  your argument is bad and you should feel bad . 
  the status quo should hold until the desire for change outpaces the constant sway of public opinion . 
  change should not be precipitated on fleeting moments of support . 
  the brexit referendum fails this measure on every possible account . 
  you could n't even argue , definitively , that the * weather * did n't change the result , let alone that leave is still the majority , or has been the majority , or will continue to be the majority , for the forseeable future . 
  it 's probably high , and admittingly arbitrary , but a 10 % victory completely demolishes any ambiguity . 
  a 52-48 % result ? 
  that 's essentially too close to call . 
  anybody who pretends like it was a definitive , clear , unchanging result is a fucking liar . 
  well , here 's the question ; how much do you think public opinion sways on any particular partisan/highly divisive issue over the course of a year ? 
  if the philosophy is that policy should be immune from those sways , that number 's what you should base your bar on . 
  a 10 % margin might be high and somewhat arbitrary , but it pretty solidly stands up to that . 
  the issue is that public opinion is constantly swaying . 
  what if leave was the majority opinion for * literally , and literally * only the day of the referendum ? 
  what if public opinion swelled towards leave until the referendum , and then dropped back down to the minority ? 
  eu membership is n't a light switch that can be flicked on and off . 
  you need to make decisions that reflect * actual , significant * changes in the public opinion , and 52 % is just waaaay too goddamn close to call . 
  you might as well base your eu membership on a coinflip if you 're gon na be holding referendums while public opinion is so evenly divided . 
  ** that 's ** extreme and unrealistic . 
  ... which is still infinitely more memorizable and instantly comprehensible than `` galleta '' . 
  as low as 2 % 4 % assumes that every single one of those leave voters would 've chosen abstain before remain , which is * precisely * as silly as my 2 % number . 
  okay , so that 's pretty much a neutered version of what i 'm suggesting . 
  i would 've gone for like , a straight 60 % win for a definitive conclusion ; the idea to tie the result to a popular margin that wo n't be easily shaken around . 
  i do n't think your idea would overcome that issue at all , though , especially when the `` abstain '' portion of the vote is really small . 
  it just does n't seem right to me to make a huge , unchanging decision based on what could have been a single day of barely-breaking-50 % support , which could happen in your scenario if the spoilt ballot count was low enough . 
  quick clarification ; by `` spoilt '' ballots , do you mean the ballots that were ( a ) submitted incorrectly ( b ) ballots from people choosing to abstain , ( c ) people who did n't vote but could ? 
  you made this scenario of another referendum being held that was essentially a perfect parallel to the first referendum , but you seemed to imply that if this hypothetical 2nd referendum was n't as robust as the 1st one , you 'd ignore it . 
   i would have preferred us to vote to stay in the eu the counter-argument to that is that they are n't having votes on literally every single other law in relevant british history ; trade agreements , alliances , etc. 
  votes in affirmation of the status quo do n't really make sense , unless it 's procedural , like elections . 
  we do n't elect laws or trade agreements . 
   what i struggle to accept is a result that basically said `` we are n't really decided '' . 
  that 's what i think people are n't getting . 
  the result was a lot closer to `` too close to call '' than it was `` definite leave win '' or `` definite remain win '' . 
  people , rhetorically , are treating leave as a default majority , and not a fleeting , temporary , occasional thing . 
  they 're assuming without assertion that the public opinion can not have changed in such a way that would have changed this leave `` majority '' into a minority . 
  a supermajority , while technically not perfect , would eliminate about 99 % of the instances of majorities turning into minorities , vice versa , etc. 
   if we were to hold an equivalent referendum , with the same level of build up , the same level of discussion , the same level scrutiny , and the same question , should the united kingdom remain a member of he european union , and that came back 52/48 the other way , i would view that as a sufficient change in the will of the people to cancel our leaving true eu . 
  ... and if it were half that , you 'd say it was an illegitimate referendum ? 
  what ? 
   but it 's the strongest indicator we have on the british voters opinions on our membership of the eu . 
  ... and that indication is `` too close to call '' , not `` a clear and resounding leave '' ...  but in the absence of other , equivalent data , we must take the result at face value . 
  we * must ? 
  * i do n't buy that , not for an instance . 
   more wish to leave than remain . 
  that 's * still not a statement you can definitely make * . 
  no matter how many times you repeat it !, 
  the only * right * , fair , and * statistically accurate * call you can make on the current situation is , `` i do n't know '' i mean , honestly , how small would the margin of leave victory need to be for you to start saying , `` too close to call '' ? 
  half a million ? 
  a hundred thousand ? 
  a thousand ? 
  would you really say , if leave only won by ** 1001 votes ** , that leave is currently , obviously , the majority , today ? 
  seriously ? 
  because that 's nonsense . 
  anything besides a `` i do n't know '' is a complete nonsensical * lie . 
  * honestly ; you 're saying that if leave won by ** one single vote ** , that it would be a clear statement on the current majority , seven months in the future ??!?!? 
  i ca n't take that argument seriously . 
  i ca n't seriously believe that 's an argument you 're making in good faith , and not just an argument you 're adopting to suit the conclusion you want . 
  wow !, 
  you did a really great job of completely removing * any * nuance or substance from the argument i 'm making !, 
  great job , buckaroo !, 
  okay , so the * instant * support for remain hits 50 % , you support completely dropping * all * brexit actions , indefinitely , until leave hits 50 % again ? 
  and then just stopping and starting again and again , day by day , forever ? 
  * maybe * that would make sense if eu membership were an instantaneous thing , like a light switch , but it is n't , so it does n't . 
   all polling shows that after the referendum public opinion has held firm . 
  source ? 
  i 've only heard the opposite . 
   everyone all over the world told us that this referendum was incredibly important .
