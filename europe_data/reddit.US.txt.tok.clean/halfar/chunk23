  and ? 
  public opinion still sways . 
  if it did n't , we would n't have those polls you mentioned one sentence earlier ; we 'd just know that public opinion is unchanging . 
   we went into the polling stations knowing that it was serious and after thinking hard about it . 
  okay , that 's just you forcing your own narrative up this argument 's butt . 
   we voted to leave , with our eyes open . 
  that seems doubtful , but it pretty explicitly lays out your bias . 
  you 're not making a rational argument ; you 're writing a story that you 're trying to sell to me . 
  come back when you 've got more than rhetoric . 
  yes , and 52 % is ** tiny . 
  ** it 's so small that you absolutely can not assure me that this 52 % `` majority '' still even exists !, 
  you have * no * way of assuring me that this majority even still exists today . 
  you ca n't even convince me that this `` majority '' lasted for more than a single day , or that it only existed for a single day because of the weather or something !, 
  if it were a supermajority , all doubt is gone . 
  public opinion sways by more than 2 % all the godfuckingdamn time , but not 10 % , or larger , without cataclysmic events . 
  unless you 're seriously going to assert that public opinion on stuff does n't sway back and forth like a swing ? 
  but public opinion sways literally all the time , on a massive number of issues , on any scale of time , from days to years and everything in between . 
  who are you to say that public opinion was n't at the crest of its sway towards leave the day of the referendum ? 
  the question really is , when does the uk get to vote on eu membership again ? 
  what 's stopping people from having another referendum in 3 months ? 
  i 'm not british , so i do n't actually know if there is , in fact , a specific bottleneck that actually is stopping another referendum . 
   we are unlikely to have a supermajority in our lifetimes . 
  then the status quo should remain , in order to respect the views of the minority . 
  the exact same argument would apply if `` status quo '' meant staying out of the eu . 
  without * some * kind of increased burden to changing the status quo , destruction of the status quo is essentially inevitable , because they can keep trying and trying and trying , forever , until they succeed once . 
  it 's like saying , idk ... 
  it 's like if you and i were playing chess , for eternity , over the fate of the universe . 
  every time you win , the universe remains in tact , but if i win just once , i 'll destroy the universe -- that kind of set-up is ** total shit ** , right ? 
  it 's infinitely biased towards me , since i only have to win once to more or less permanently get my way . 
   we ca n't know for sure what the result would be like if we re-ran the referendum today , or in a week , or in a year . 
  which is ** exactly ** why the uk should stay , for now . 
  it could literally have been the fucking weather that changed the result . 
   leaving now is surely the lesser evil . 
  what exactly is the evil of remain , compared to the tyranny of what might have been the majority for as little as literally a single day ? 
  right , we need to have * some * limits on the ever-changing opinion of the majority . 
  even in the us , unpopular politicians serve out their entire term , even if their support in the polls falls the entire time they 're in office . 
  that 's another bottleneck against tyranny of the majority . 
  i 'm not sure i 'm following ; you 're actually saying the uk should vote on every single bit of law that 's been enacted since before like ... 30 years ago ? 
  the function of a 60 % requirement is to ensure that the majority is n't a fleeting majority . 
  what if , hypothetically , 52 % was the highest brexit could 've ever gotten ? 
  what if , a week before or after , remain would 've won by 4 % ? 
  what if it were literally the fucking weather that could change the result one way or another ? 
  with 60 % , there are no doubts like that . 
  a 60 % is a solid , unchanging , unyielding victory . 
  can anybody prove that the 52-48 % leave victory holds up ? 
  of course not . 
   under nobody 's logic does government policy change from day to day if support of a particular policy change . 
  * exactly * but what if that were the case with brexit , more or less ? 
  is a 3 % surge one way or the other really that far outside the realm of possibility ? 
  that 's * exactly * why we should have a higher burden for changing the status quo than a literal , simple majority . 
  that is to say , what if brexit was * only * in the majority for a very short window of time , that just happened to coincide with the referendum ? 
  it would be a mistake to make such an incredibly massive change to the system under such a fleeting , tiny , temporary shift in public opinion , were that the case , right ? 
  obviously , if leave hit 66 % , for a ** hypothetical example ** , it 's obviously not some fleeting majority , and will stay a majority for a very long time ... but 52 % ? 
  that shit literally could have been the weather that makes the difference . 
  that 's stupid . 
  come back when you 're willing to make an honest argument . 
  that 's completely ridiculous , and most likely not a real solution that you actually believe . 
  i did n't say that , mate !, 
  you were asking a completely loaded question , regardless . 
   changing the rules would bring total chaos , what are you going to do with people who are against changing the rules and might act upon it ? 
  just think about the assumptions that are laid out in that question . 
  it 's nonsense . 
  `` we should have a supermajority requirement for referendums . '', 
  `` okay , but what are you gon na do about the people who will completely freak out once you change the rule like that ? '', 
  alternatively , the matter should be easy to slip in and out of , like the us power structure . 
  we hold elections every 2 years in order to facilitate the constant changing of public opinion . 
  ... eu membership is totally different , however . 
  like our constitution . 
  neither are meant to facilitate fleeting moments of majority or minority support . 
   but then your keeping the majority of voters in the eu against their will . 
  you have to have consideration for * both * sides ; the majority and the minority , which is ** especially ** important when they 're so close in size . 
  you ca n't just change the status quo weekly . 
  what happens if remain is the majority next week ? 
  and then leave the week after that ? 
  and then remain the week after that ? 
  and then leave the week after that ? 
  and then remain the week after that ? 
  you 're treating the `` majority '' of leave as some permanent monolith that will remain and stand the test of time for generations . 
  you 're assuming that we will always be leave-majority , forever , and always , for the forseeable future . 
  when really , the `` majority '' could easily become `` the minority '' in a week , or a day , and is as fickle as the weather -- * quite fucking literally as fickle as the weather , according to some . 
  *  we quite correctly view trumps elections as tyranny of the minority . 
  how would ignoring the results of the eu referendum be any different ? 
  the difference is that the us presidency is * designed * to be constantly changing . 
  no matter how bad a president is , he gets the boot after 4 or 8 years . 
  it 's * meant * to be a short term , that is highly adaptable to changing attitudes . 
  it 's * supposed * to facilitate the oscillation of public opinion around 50 % . 
  it 's * supposed * to be a constant , revolving door between one position and the other . 
  it 's the reason why the us has elections every 2 years . 
  eu membership is completely , utterly , absolutely different in every single conceivable way . 
  you are n't going to hold eu membership elections every 4 years , are you ? 
  you laid out a completely loaded question . 
  you asked me my opinions of some completely absurd scenario , where the referendums are suddenly changed by the will of a single person ( i.e me ) `` what are you going to do with the people who do n't like the idea of a single person suddenly completely overhauling the referendum system '' -- you 're assuming that , given the power , i would instantly , individually , change the rules . 
  that 's a bunch of loaded nonsense . 
  dummy , you chose to engage me and try to drag me into a trite-as-fucking-hell `` eu means no sovereignty '' argument . 
  give me all the fucking pardons in the entire fucking world for not biting that bait your majesty, 
  okay , so what happens if say , public opinion changes by a whopping 2 % ? 
  let 's say that , authoritative polling comes out , and shows most people support remain by 0.5 % . 
  what 's the right thing to do ? 
  completely abandon brexit , and only resume the * instant * it crosses back over 50 % ? 
   no it should n't .
