  that 's not an argument . 
   more people want to be out of the eu than in . 
  you ca n't prove that ; you can only prove that `` most people who voted wanted to be out of the eu , at this particular point in time '' . 
  you ca n't say that ** most ** british people , out of ** all ** british people ** currently ** want to leave the eu . 
  let 's say highly authoritative polling comes out that shows public opinion swaying towards remain ; 51 % - 49 % -- does your argument suddenly do a 180 ? 
  do we suddenly drop * all * brexit efforts , instantly , and only resume them once brexit reclaims the 50 % actively voting majority ? 
  okay , so what happens if remain support * furiously surges * 3 % in the polls , up to 51 % ? 
  does all of the effort that 's been put into brexit just immediately get thrown out the window ? 
  and then fished back into the window once leave reclaims 51 % ? 
  and then repeat , infinitely , forever ? 
  or does brexit deserve a permanent , unchanging , advantage in this struggle ? 
  which is stupid, 
   changing the rules would bring total chaos , says your highly active imagination  what are you going to do with people who are against changing the rules and might act upon it ? 
  well , considering i 'm not the supreme dictator of the united kingdom , and lack the authority or ability to enforce a supermajority clause for referendums , would n't * force * a supermajority caluse even if i had that power ... this entire scenario is completely shit . 
  there are quite literally millions of pieces of your government that you did n't vote on , but merely inherited . 
  trade deals are n't different . 
  you did n't vote on the uk 's alliance with portugal , did you ? 
   foreign rule * sigh * okay , i can see where this is going , but fuck off . 
  my argument is n't about whether or not remain was the right choice or not , and i 'm not gon na let you try to drag this shit towards that argument . 
  come back when you 've got an argument that is n't * incredibly * loaded . 
  if 2 % had switched over to remain , it 'd be a tie . 
  the vast majority of voters were n't abstainers , and turn-out was high enough we can reasonably assume that `` remain '' was the big alternative to leave , not abstain . 
  i 'm gon na copy/paste my answer to this question from another thread here  it 's a case-by-case basis . 
  some issues are far more important and long-lasting than others . 
  regardless , you do n't want a smoke ban to be written , then undone , then redone , and then re-undone , ad infinitium , just because the popular support on the subject is constantly oscilliating between 50 % and 49 % , do you ? 
  does that seriously make any sense to you ? 
   i 'm not going to assign a strict guideline so you can pick at it and give fifteen goddamn billion examples of `` okay , but how about ... '' so you can try to sneak some perceived discrepancy and act like that tears apart the entire concept . 
  idk , 2/3rds seems fair for such a big issue , but like , my opinion on the subject probably is n't the most authoritative . 
  for something as permanent and with such incredibly far-reaching consequences and wide reaches of effects , i 'd say that the burden does need to be pretty significantly above 50 % . 
  yeah , i 'm kinda picking at what you 're talking about in other comments . 
  i 'm pretty sure most brexiteers would n't agree that we should stop brexiting the instant remain support hits 51 % ( or 52 % , whatever ) , but it 's consistent with their logic of following through with a 52 % victory , come hell or high water . 
  no ; only changes to the status quo should require a higher burden of popular support . 
  i will say , in order to assert the consistency of my idea , that the uk should 've required a higher burden of popular support than 50 % to enter the eu in the first place . 
  let 's take some hypothetical issue ; `` would you rather the official color of the united kingdom be blue , or red '' . 
  let 's say that the vote on this matter is 51 % blue and 49 % red . 
  sub-sequentially , the uk makes blue its official color ... but then the polls show that the results have flipped in the matter of a few weeks , and now the polls show 51 % red , and 49 % blue . 
  sub-sequentially , the uk makes red its official color ... but then the polls show that the results have flipped in the matter of a few weeks ... etc etc now , let 's say it takes * x * amount of work to make red or blue `` the official color of the united kingdom '' . 
  how much * x * amount of work would be required for another issue that oscillates around 50 % ? 
  returning to brexit ; what is supposed to happen if , or when , remain beats leave in the polls ? 
  do we hold another referendum every few weeks , the result changing every single time ? 
  if the argument is that we should do * exactly * what the 51 % want , why does n't that logic hold up as soon as remain is 51 % ? 
  should we stop and pause brexit as puplic opinion shifts around by 1 or 2 percents around 50 % ? 
  well , not * quite * the same , but yeah , point taken . 
   i do n't recall , what supermajority was required to join in the first place ? 
  mate , i 'm not describing history , i 'm laying out my ideas for what the obligations * should * be ; the burden of changing the status quo of a nation should be higher than 50 % . 
  that 's the point you 're arguing against ; anything else is a strawman . 
   what percentage do you like to see to inflict some new law on people ? 
  is 51 % enough to ban , let 's say tobacco , and make it a criminal offence ? 
  it 's a case-by-case basis . 
  some issues are far more important and long-lasting than others . 
  regardless , you do n't want a smoke ban to be written , then undone , then redone , and then re-undone , ad infinitium , just because the popular support on the subject is constantly oscilliating between 50 % and 49 % , do you ? 
  does that seriously make any sense to you ? 
  i 'm not going to assign a strict guideline so you can pick at it and give fifteen goddamn billion examples of `` okay , but how about ... '' so you can try to sneak some perceived discrepancy and act like that tears apart the entire concept . 
   and when it comes time to remove mistakes of the past are you suggesting it the other way around : that 65 % or 74 % will be prohibited from having marijuana because of the other 35 or 26 % have the right to inflict their status quo tyranny upon them ? 
  * sigh * , again , see , your argumentative strategy here is plain to see . 
  i 'll say it again , because i put my point in the middle of a paragraph before and i do n't want you to ignore it ; you should n't have laws that work like light switches , that constantly flicker on and off as popular opinion hypothetically oscillates between 49 % and 50 % . 
   what happened to rule by consent ? 
  it was never a fucking thing , lmao . 
  that 's why `` sovereign citizens '' as we have in the us can get a splintery chunk of wood shoved up their assholes . 
  just because you do n't * consent * to paying a tax does n't mean you do n't have to pay them , for example . 
  i 'll ask you a hypothetical . 
  let 's say , *** hypothetically *** , that right now , 51 % of uk folk are in favor of remaining . 
  in this * still hypothetical * scenario , should we completely abandon all brexit efforts , and only continue to resume them once we ** hypothetically ** go back to being over 50 % ? 
  thanks for fucking ignoring the rest of my comment < 3, 
  require supermajority to change the status quo . 
  hypothetically , supermajority to get into the eu , supermajority to get out . 
   most generally agree that if 51 % oppose a law it is n't just to subject them to it i guess most people generally fall into the fallacy of popular opinion then , and their thoughts should be disregarded entirely . 
   but is it just to subject 49 % to laws they oppose just because the other 51 % support them ? 
  if those laws were passed with a supermajority , sure ...  when its 51 % they 're oppressed but when it is 49 % we 're fine with it ? 
  what ? 
   the eu lost the consent of the people to rule by virtue of not getting at least 66 % remain . 
  ... what ? 
  okay , okay , wait . 
  let 's back up like , fifty goddamn steps here . 
  ... not really ? 
  if 1.2 m is `` a lot of people '' , then surely 33 million must be enough to make you shit your pants from the sheer scale of the matter ? 
  and that 's being really generous , not including the people who ** ca n't ** vote on matters that deeply concern them , and also people who chose not to vote . 
   if the 52 % loses 2 % it 's 50-48 and 2 % blank votes , still a brexit win . 
  what blank votes ? 
  it 's yes , or no . 
  no matter what , the results should [ add up to 100 % ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-brexit-referendum/ ) . 
  not 98 % . 
  if you 're arguing that * every single one * would have not voted , your math is still off -- and you 've got no right to assume they 'd all rather not vote than vote remain . 
   we already have protections for that , democracy is rule by the majority , not rule by the minority . 
  first off , there were * zero * `` protections '' in this case , since the guys in charge can basically make brexit mean whatever the fuck they want , and in fact , are probably making for a harder `` brexit '' than most of the voters envisioned . 
  secondly , there 's a difference . 
  voting to remain is to vote for the status quo . 
  it 's not `` rule by the minority '' . 
  you do n't vote every year to keep your laws on the book , do you ? 
  you hypothetically vote to add more laws , which would necessitate a higher burden of popular support , and vote to remove laws , which would also necessitate a higher burden of popular support . 
  since there are * only * two options , it 's 2 % . 
  if the 52 % loses 2 % , it becomes an even 50 % -50 % split . 
  and the idea of a supermajority is to put a massive bottleneck on the power and speed of the influence of the majority . 
  to do pure 51 % majority all of the time on every single possible issue would result in an unambiguous `` tyranny of the majority '' . 
  brexiteers should be real fucking thankful they do n't have to deal with this `` 2 % win ? 
  too bad , not enough '' fucking dumbass electoral horseshit, 
  it 's completely insane how binding and powerful a 2 % victory is . 
  it should 've been like , supermajority or some shit . 
  also sometimes america, 
  the thing that makes dutch unique is the fact that it is * really * similar to english , in a lot of ways , and the way that they 're unsimilar do n't even compare to the ways that english is unsimilar to a lot of other languages .
