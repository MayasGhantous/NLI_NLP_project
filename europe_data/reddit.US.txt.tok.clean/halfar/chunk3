  bin laden explicitly planned the similar things when he attacked the twin towers in the us . 
  every single goddamn nation in the world struggles with racism . 
  it might be muted by homogenity , but it still unquestionably exists . 
  at least a black man can say he 's american without argument . 
  or a chinese person . 
  or a pacific islander . 
  or a hispanic latino . 
  could you say the same thing about 2nd or 3rd generation immigrant minorities in japan ? 
  sweden ? 
  guess the americas just do some shit better ? 
  your nationality does n't need to be tied to an ethnicity . 
  you 're french by virtue of liberty , equality , and fraternity , not by virtue of your blood . 
  the word for `` culture-ism '' is xenophobia , more or less . 
  there would have extremely similar xenophobia towards japanese . 
  polish culture would be `` incompatible '' with german in a fucking instant . 
  beethoven did nothing wrong . 
  it 's isis long-term game plan to turn westerners against muslims and force them onto their side for a massive war . 
  basically all muslims vs the west world war kinda shit . 
  there 's no doubt they 're encouraging ( and possibly facilitating ? ), 
  the refugee crisis . 
  it 's working like a fucking charm if you look at the direction this sub 's been going in . 
  i think you misread my question . 
  who has enough power to actually enforce the law ? 
  who * important * cares if it 's legal ? 
  what are you gon na do ; sanction croatia ? 
  yesterday , i told myself i was gon na buy black socks . 
  i bought white socks . 
  you know why ? 
  * germany . 
  but this time they 're brown !, 
  completely incompatible with the euphoric european way of life . 
  you 're really pathetic . 
  [ i do n't believe you , but tell it to this guy .

  and that sounds okay to you ???? 
  `` liberty , equality , fuck everyone else '', 
  no , dude . 
  you 're not fucking better than anyone else just for being a swede . 
   when it comes to immigration , ** this sub ** is further right than our craziest fringe ** candidates , ** no , i am pretty goddamned certain i did not . 
  i said that this sub , not all of european citizens , or even a minority , is further to the right ** on the subject of immigration ** than even our craziest fringe candidates , who are individuals , but i ** did not ** say `` our right-wingers '' as in to imply a general population , but just ** candidates ** as in the individual fringe candidates . 
  in addition , that / u/underfireman asshole was the first one to bring up americans , so you 're still completely off trying to dismiss me . 
   a fucking american pretending all high and mighty lol ( sorry if i sound like an anti-american cunt ) . 
  `` do n't fucking tell me about reading interpretation , sweede . '', 
  -- would n't you just want to slap a shithead who 'd say something like that ? 
  i 'm not talking on behalf of my government just as you people are n't talking on behalf of yours , except maybe you . 
  did you not just fucking read what i said ? 
   ** i do n't represent my country ** and i 'm thankfully not deluded enough to believe the shitheads on this sub represent their countries . 
  seriously , it always comes down to the fucking flair . 
  would y' all be able to have a conversation for half a goddamn second and not * immediately * use my flair to dismiss me if i just got fucking rid of it ? 
  is that what it 'll take ? 
  really ? 
  you do n't see me disparaging swedes because of your flair , do you ? 
  is that how fucking pathetic this place has gotten ? 
  ** three ** `` lol , yank wtf ever '' ? 
  is that as good as you people get ? 
  they did n't . 
  you over-reacted . 
  [ that post still has n't been removed , y' know . 
  why 'd you ignore me ?

  i 'd pick being a yank a million times before i 'd pick what this subreddit 's turning into . 
  at least `` let 's just build landmines to murder immigrants '' does n't fucking fly on this side of the pond . 
  like , what the fuck is even the point of european solidarity if it stops ** instantly ** at the border ? 
  `` liberty , equality , fraternity !, 
  ... but only for french people . '', 
  that dude from earlier in this thread is literally arguing in favor of using landmines to deter refugees . 
  smh i ca n't even stand it, 
  dude , you 're a fucking psychopath . 
  what the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  you do definitely sound like an anti-american cunt . 
  : / when it comes to immigration , this sub is further right than our craziest fringe candidates , so you can go ahead and shove your whataboutism somewhere where the sun does n't shine . 
  i do n't represent my country and i 'm * thankfully * not deluded enough to believe the shitheads on this sub represent their countries . 
  it used to be that / r/politics was the worst among / r/news , / r/worldnews , and that / r/europe was the best . 
  everything 's all upside down now . 
  this subreddit is filled with wretched shitheads . 
  as long as the hysteric fucking lunatics on this sub do n't go out and lay some more . 
  jesus fucking christ you 're * hoping * for people to walk into landmines you fucking lunatic ? 
  russia joins eu russia becomes new center of eu poland forgotten, 
  so it 's been another 4 hours , and this post is still at the top of the sub . 
  dclauzel is very much active right now * not watching eurobasket * . 
  i guess you 're just really shitty at countdowns ? 
  poor you . 
  hopefully next time you just hold your breath waiting . 
  or you were just full of shit , maybe ? 
  it has n't been removed yet . 
  thoughts on that ? 
  this sub has been making me so sad and angry . 
  the comments are no fucking different from your average online newspaper shit nowadays . 
  do you think america should deport all 11 million illegal mexicans back home ? 
  i would be reluctant to describe isis as a theocracy for a massive laundry list of reasons , but it looks like there might have been at least * one * person to catch a bit of the sarcasm there . 
  god these fucking lunatics are suggesting that we should * limit human rights * . 
  like we 're gon na run out of ballots for voting or some shit . 
  i hate this sub so much nowadays . 
  * ppppffffff * what a maroon , amirite / r/europe ? 
  syria got its independence nearly ** eighty years ago ** . 
  how could they * possibly * have any lingering issues from such ancient history ? 
  it 's just like in america . 
  we gave black people full citizenship rights slightly less than 50 years ago , and now we do n't have * any * racial problems whatsoever . 
  europe should really take a cue from america on the whole `` our society is collapsing because of * migrant rapists * '' thing . 
  he 's a real trooper with great plans to deal with america 's migrant rapist muslim crisis .
