   not saying that people should not get welfare . 
  and i do n't think that there is huge shortage of labour . 
  there will be as the native population really starts to contract . 
  this is very long-term stuff . 
  ... what in god 's fucking name are you talking about ? 
  you cut off the weed from its core , not the stems . 
  you stop the cause of radicalization , not just the result of it . 
  you bomb 1 isis fighter ; his family hates you for life , and radicalizes 4 new fighters . 
  it 's not an easy problem to deal with ; `` just blow them up '' is anti-intellectual and ineffective . 
  treat them like humans . 
  how do humans end up in such a wretched position ? 
  what would it take to turn a regular human being into a militant ? 
  how can we stop that ? 
  that 's what i mean . 
  the best cure is prevention , as always . 
  it comes down to this ; once they decide to leave their homes , there 's no way to stop them . 
  walls , guns , oceans , death , etc , wo n't stop them . 
  we can observe that much through how much force the us puts into the mexican border for such little effect ... and , well , all other historical immigration movements . 
  so the only option left is to stop them from ever wanting to leave their homes in the first place . 
  help bring stability . 
  stop the effects of global warming . 
  that kinda shit . 
  but nobody talks about it . 
  / r/europe just gives us the `` it 's not our responsibility '' assholes . 
  more war is n't going to solve this problem . 
  what are you , the united states ? 
  we need to address the issue of ** why ** and ** how ** people get radicalized in the first place , and then neutralize those problems . 
  and guess what !, 
  bombs usually radicalize survivors !, 
  hurray !, 
  we figured out part of the `` why '' and `` how '' !, 
  :d you kill a guy , his brother hates you for life . 
  his brother hates you , he teaches his children to hate you . 
  one insurgent killed breeds four new ones . 
  you 've just made the problem worse . 
  you kill a daughter , or a mother , or a friend . 
  you blow up a building , or a town . 
  this is how you turn people into terrorists . 
  it 's not as fucking simple as `` kill anyone with that flag '' -- that 's just being anti-intellectual . 
  is that why this place has gotten to be so / r/european-like lately ? 
  why the change ? 
   do n't get me wrong , i 'm not talking action in the ominous final solution kind of way , no . 
  we need a frank realisation that we ca n't help everyone kind of a pointless statement since * nobody * has said we need to help everyone , but okay . 
   callous though it may be , the wave will have to be stopped at some point , so that we may re-assess the situation and rally further resources , if they 'll be available . 
  you know what 's really odd ? 
  there 's never any discussion on stopping the * why * of refugees . 
  it 's always `` how can we keep them out of our borders '' . 
  it just seems extremely ... superficial to me . 
  it 's almost like an elephant in the room . 
  you wan na know the fastest fucking way to deal with the migrants ? 
  get an army , get in syria , murder isis , organize free elections . 
  the migrants are n't gon na stop until the war is over , but absolutely nobody wants to talk about actually * doing * anything to help . 
  it 's almost infuriating how anti-confrontational europe is sometimes . 
  so much power to do good and drive peace , but so much `` who gives a shit ? 
  it 's not our problem '' when it ** very clearly is their problem . 
  whatever . 
  but yeah . 
  if europe remains completely and utterly unwilling to actually address the * why * of immigration , then they will be forced to deal with the flood , and there is ** no way ** to stop the flood , since we 've clearly established that these people would rather die than stay in syria . 
  it 's the same in the us ; we are n't gon na get rid of 11 million illegal mexicans without turning into a really horrifying police state . 
  the syrian war will not end soon . 
  therefore , the immigrants will continue to flow . 
  therefore , they will continue to flow regardless of how much `` capacity '' european nations think they have . 
  therefore , if they * actually * want to stop the flow of immigrants , they have to actually address the source instead of dicking around with fences and shit . 
   uncontrolled waves of unprocessed people who refuse to be processed , throwing crazed tantrums , and are picky in terms of where they can get the best money for free are draining on the europeans ' good-will and stalling real , meaningful and good ( objectively , given the awfulness of the situation ) progress . 
  try to put yourself in their shoes . 
  you were living a good modern-ish life 5 years ago and have a good education . 
  your life is very comparable to a regular european 's life . 
  suddenly , war obliterates everything , and it 's about as anticipated as say , canada collapsing into civil war . 
  you , the young male , must secure the best future possible for your wife and children . 
  are you really gon na go to hungary , where the government is xenophobic , or czech republic , where the people do n't want you ? 
   eventually , maybe the world will muster enough courage to speak frankly with the americans about their economic , political and , unfortunately , military foot-print on the whole world , and whether it 's helping or harming the bigger picture . 
  hold on , brah . 
  you ca n't pin isis and the syrian civil war on the us . 
  that was assad murdering peaceful protestors and sending a very well-off nation into a civil war . 
  that 's what created isis ; not iraq . 
  they just conquered the most vulnerable parts of iraq afterwards in what was pretty terrible timing . 
  obama could n't have predicted what the syrian civil war would turn into when we withdrew in late 2011 . 
  and regardless , `` america broke it why should we do anything '' is a really weak argument . 
  with great power comes great responsibility . 
  europe should n't be selfish , especially given their ... awful history with the rest of the world . 
   that be said , i always hear that this is biggest migrant crisis since wwii , some maybe big numbers will leave bigger impact ? 
  heh that was only 70 years ago . 
  :p everything seems pretty well enough now with that now , huh ? 
  [ quietly sweeps israel under a rug ] anyhoo ; this is actually an even better time for mass immigration . 
  remember ; most of the leading economies have shrinking native populations , which * would * mean a recession/depression if it were n't for immigration . 
  i find it extremely likely that these mass immigrants are one day gon na be the saving grace of the eu economy , much like mexicans in the us , which is * exactly * why germany is expending so much `` altruism '' for their benefit . 
  there 's a lot of literature to be read on this . 
   but how it will work i do n't know , not sure on best assimilation policies either , but it should probably involve anti segregation , and at the same time dispersion , break down of muslim migrant communities . 
  it 's not so much dispersion as avoiding ghetto-izing the populations . 
  it 's not a big deal if there 's a disproportionate number of immigrants in one location as long as they 're put on the same ground as everyone else . 
  say , the difference between african-americans and asian-americans . 
  but the most * basic * thing more than anything else by a huuuuge margin is just a little fucking bit of respect , y' know ? 
  like , you might not like their religions , but you should n't let that be a barrier to your relationship with them as human beings -- that kinda shit . 
   that could make them more involved with local community and perhaps making their children to adapt to local life style . 
  there 's the united states , which is a `` melting pot '' , that gets compared to canada , which is a `` mosaic '' . 
  i ca n't say for sure which works better , to be honest . 
  anybody of any race/religion/creed can be a `` true '' american or canadian . 
   that be said , i do n't think we should be just letting them in , giving them welfare , and leaving them in their communities . 
  giving them welfare is one thing that would * prevent * massive segregation and discrimination . 
  taking away their welfare is n't gon na help jack shit , i promise that .
