  but job training , language teaching , etc are all obviously important services that can be offered without bias . 
  there are , for instance , plenty of syrian refugees in germany who * have * technical training , such as being a doctor , but can not use their skills because of their non-fluent german speaking . 
   and leaving them in their communities . 
  sounds like you 're more of a fan of the melting pot , then . 
  do you think these concerns will significantly carry over into second-generation syrian-europeans ? 
  assimilation is usually quite strong assuming the minority group has n't been heavily prejudiced or discriminated against , i.e african-americans . 
  at least in the real world and not / r/europe and / r/worldnews . 
  heh , i suppose you 're right . 
  definitely need to step up my modern spanish politics game . 
  it reminds me of when i was still a kid in high school . 
  our global studies teacher showed us a video of some kid making a really emotionally charged argument about why tibet should stay apart of china -- `` it 's been a part of our country longer than the us has existed '' type stuff . 
  ` course , i grew up in a hippy liberal trash town so everyone was all `` no that 's bullshit free tibet for life '' automatically and i just sorta quietly sat there thinking about what tibet 's history must be like . 
  but i ultimately still agree with the principle of self-determination . 
  it 's the only way we can excuse the existence of the belgian state . 
  ^ / s anyhoo thanks for humoring my questions ( \uff89 \u25d5 \u25e1 \u25d5 ) \uff89 * : \uff65 \uff9f \u2727, 
   but i have problem with thousands of them coming and changing social structure . 
  what * exactly * do you mean by this ? 
  it sounds super vague . 
  dehumanizing people is the worst mistake you can make , which should be belligerently obvious to anyone who 's ever even * glanced * at a history book . 
  make no mistake . 
  the people of isis are not monsters . 
  they are awful , cruel , and violent , but they are still human beings . 
  do you want to know what enables isis ' cruelty towards their victims ? 
  the fact that they dehumanize them . 
  that should be reason fucking enough to not dehumanize * anyone . 
  * i 'm not talking about moral relativism , i 'm talking about egalitarianism . 
   still , we ca n't be sure on percentages . 
  * sigh * this is why there 's so much hatred in the world . 
  why ca n't you just have love for your brothers and sisters across borders ? 
  why do you got ta make the tiny barriers of difference so big and constricting ? 
  have you just not experienced a lot of diversity in your life ? 
  aaaanyways , it 's not the literal percentage that matters ; you understand the point that was being made , right ? 
   and i 'm somewhat of an anti-theist or something similar . 
  well . 
  at least you 're consistent . 
   but you sound like you are familiar with spain . 
  a bold assumption i just play ckii and shit x_x but yeah , we ** definitely ** have `` swing states '' in the us , too . 
  so a lot of people disapprove of catalonian independence because it 'd shift the political balance against their interests ? 
  am i understanding that right ? 
   first thing , how do we know that percentage is correct , they eat , sleep , drink , shit , fuck , talk , walk , speak , work , lift , sit , read , write , cheat , whore , run , change , evolve , hate , cry , fear , scream , fight , love , cherish , enjoy , live , and die the same as you . 
  need i go on ? 
  we can be here for * quite * a while . 
  i 'm gon na go out on a limb here and say that egalitarianism * probably * is n't an american exclusive ethos . 
  and i * am * right in guessing that you 're an islamophobe , right ? 
  then let 's talk about patience . 
  have you noticed how fucking impatient everyone here is ? 
  this refugee crisis has really only blown up in the past couple of months , and people are already screaming `` why are n't they integrating yet !? '', 
  like ; these guys are * barely * off the boat ^ ** figuratively ** and we 're already talking about how they are n't fluent europeans yet ? 
  this is a * long * process . 
  you 're incapable of seeing the 99.9 % of things that make you similar to a person of another culture and focusing on the 0.1 % that makes you different . 
  i 'm guessing you 're probably an islamophobe ? 
  i 'd think a consciousness would imply that you 'd have a reaction to the concept of empathy , so maybe you 're a plant actually ? 
  are you a robot ? 
  wan na hear the realest shit you 'll ever hear in your entire life ? 
  there are over seven billion people in the world , and they are all almost * exactly * the same as you . 
  the things that make you different , by and large , are infinitely small compared to the things that make you similar . 
  well , you 're free to go to / r/european where xenophobia is actively encouraged . 
  he 's said a lot of things , i was n't referring to one specific comment he made otherwise . 
  they 're like subreddit ~ ~ refugees ~ ~ migrants . 
  walls are n't gon na stop them . 
  i also use `` you silly goose '' a lot . 
  it 's surprisingly powerful . 
  * no , that 's not how it works , you silly goose . 
  there are many other kinds of oppression than just economic though , right ? 
  castillian is the dominant language in spain , but obviously nobody wants basque , catalan , leonese , and galician to evaporate completely , for instance . 
  nobody wants to become northern ireland . 
  : s i 'm sure there 's also the matter of population ; i 'd find it hard to believe that catalonia has an extremely disproportionate political power compared to other places in spain . 
   ** it is not ok to suggest that members of different cultures or races are incapable of cohabiting . 
  **  ** it is not ok to suggest that some races or cultures are inherently better than others . 
  ** careful . 
  [ that 's a bannable offense . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ), 
  if the kind of shit-headedness that you 're promoting is what it stands for , then i say let it fucking fall . 
  here 's something . 
  it 's just the us , though , not the entire americas and oceania . 
  also does n't distinguish europeans from non europeans but w/e it 's not the point https://books.google.com/books?id=vk4mjz1oilwc&amp;pg=pa135&amp;lpg=pa135&amp;dq=total+number+of+immigration+arrivals+in+the+us+since+1776&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=emucdulpw9&amp;sig=vr_vjz-jkwtj30auupqpbftrwsy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cb4q6aewagovchmixsrxkmlxxwivlyaich04nqt1#v=onepage&amp;q=total%20number%20of%20immigration%20arrivals%20in%20the%20us%20since%201776&amp;f=false wow !, 
  over 900,000 ** economic migrants ** from 1851 to 1860 . 
  sure glad we figured out how to get over our xenophobic shitheadedness and learned how to help them become americans over time . 
  us total population in 1850 was 23 million . 
  how 's that for a comparison to modern day europe ? 
   welp , technically we do not have borders at all right now ??? 
  you mean border guards , right ? 
   safety  muh humanity unless i 'm missing something in translation , the czech poll said that they want ** no ** migrants . 
  are they really that terrifying ? 
  do czech citizens imagine syrians with giant murderous claws or something ? 
  that ... does n't exactly help your argument at all . 
  i 'll be honest , i 'm having a hard time finding a solid number for an estimated number of arrivals in america ( north and south , not just the us ) and oceania since the start of colonialism , but even the stats on that wiki are pretty damning . 
  32,244,000 over 111 years ( 1821 -- 1932 ) is still an average of 300k per year ... and that 's while our population was ** much ** smaller . 
  we can agree that it 's a huge fucking number though , right ? 
  like , you 're not gon na argue that the total number of ** migrants ** to the americas and oceania is an insignificant number , are you ? 
  the 1871 to 1960 figure is 27 million , which is still 300k per year ... so that 's a hundred and fifty years of 300k european ** economic migrants ** per year on average ... in a space smaller than europe with less population . 
   the fact that the indigenous population is predominant negative attitude toward illegal immigrants , then demonstrates the finding that , overall , 79.6 % agree in solving the migration problem with restoring controls at the borders of the eu . 
  does n't that seem just a tiny bit selfish to you ? 
  like , even a little bit ? 
  i ca n't possibly explain that in other way than xenophobia . 
  like i get it , `` it 's not our responsibility '' , but that 's a horrible and shitty argument . 
  it 's basically `` we do n't want to help '' . 
  how is this justified at all ? 
  it 's like , worse than what the crazy far-righters in the us say . 
  how did things get this bad in the czech republic ?
