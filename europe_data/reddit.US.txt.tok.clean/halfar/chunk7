  when i was young my pop forced me to eat coal because that was all we had he told me it built character , and i did n't know what he meant , but i grew up to be a proud alcoholic . 
  thankfully the liver cancer protects me from other kinds of cancer . 
  right , which is why finland is basically just another russian state . 
  so what ? 
  the united states of europe becomes forms as a slightly smaller country . 
  it 's not like the borders were n't gon na be ugly anyway , what with switzerland opting out . 
  is there a secret eu plan to build three million homes in turkey for refugees that i 'm simply unaware about ? 
  if i 'm wrong , by all means , educate me without being a snarky twat . 
  which delusional world do you live in where israel does n't get any criticism ? 
  or rather , which cocktail of highly illegal drugs do i need to take to get there ? 
   how many syrian refugees has usa taken in ? 
  yes . 
  it 's quite shameful . 
  i agree that the us should definitely be taking a whole fucking lot more than that . 
  but that is pure whataboutism , and you goddamned know it . 
  i am not arguing that the us is in the right in this matter , and i ** never ** have , so do n't fucking bring it up , okay ? 
   75 % -80 % of our population are against quotas . 
  there is no single party in our parliament that supports this plan . 
  when you bring up a specific statistic like that , is n't usually considered basic courtesy to share your source ? 
   we could perfectly support refugees in those countries both logistically and even financially . 
  y' all could . 
  but you wo n't . 
  i do n't really have the energy for hypothetical fantasies , sorry . 
   the gulf states are doing something that 's stopping refugees from coming in , so you 're definitely incorrect . 
  yeah ... 
  i would n't use the gulf states as models for how to stop immigrants . 
  it 's not 1943 anymore . 
  you 're right , though !, 
  if europe were willing to completely abandon its human rights record , it sure as shit could figure out a few ways to stop the flow of immigrants !, 
  got me there !, 
  :d  nonsense , of course . 
  * of course . 
  * all you need is a small iron curtain , right ? 
   they 're not encouraging others to do the same , they 're forcing them which in itself is a violation of international law . 
  could you actually give me a source on this ? 
  i 'd like to read the same process that you are . 
   i do n't care about irrational emotions so i am going to ignore this . 
  oh , are you by chance a robot that completely lacks compassion for the poor and disenfranchised ? 
  my bad . 
  kinda makes the whole universal healthcare deal seem sorta arbitrary , though . 
  11 million is n't comparable ? 
  you were talking about that and not just making a huge `` whataboutism '' statement , right ? 
  oh , wait , i forgot . 
  syrians are * super * ~ ~ refugees ~ ~ economic migrants that cost 100x more to help and 1000x more time to integrate compared to literally ** every other group of immigrants throughout all of history . 
  ** my bad . 
  one thing at a time , buddy . 
  lol . 
  i doubt that independent catalonia would hand control over to a federal europe . 
  but i also doubt that pretty much every other eu country would hand control over to a federal europe so ... 
  illegal mexican immigrants in the us generally fit into the socially conservative catholic camp , so i 'm just going to ignore that tidbit as a courtesy . 
  exactly how long do you expect integration to take ? 
  a couple months ? 
  two years ? 
  ten years ? 
  and what exactly makes this group of immigrants so different from ** literally every single other immigrant population movement in the entire history of the world ? 
  i 've never heard a legitimate argument for why fairly-well educated syrians are so completely and utterly incapable of integration that does n't just sound like white nationalist or other generally racist horseshit . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_diaspora not exactly sure what the hell you think you mean ? 
  i 'm sorry , but it * is * really funny . 
  you know , europeans on reddit shit on the us all the time . 
  `` what is tipping ? 
  it is truly and utterly baffling and completely incomprehensible in every way possible !, 
  such a ridiculous system ? '', 
  `` imperial measurements ? 
  oh , you mean three socks full of stones and a twinky bar and all that ? 
  thank gods we 're so enlightened to just use the number 10 all the time '' `` wow americans are so blindly religious and far right wing . 
  i 'm so glad i live in europe for our beautiful social welfare states , because we actually give a shit about the poor and disenfranchised , unlike americans . '', 
  just -- just to see you so directly parallel the most ridiculous tea party reactionary white wing fear-mongering bullshit is just hilarious , and i know that i 'm projecting a fair bit onto you . 
  it 's entirely possible that you 'd be an extreme right-winger on immigration even if you were american . 
  it 's really really funny . 
  honestly , that `` 10 % of all africa is just waiting to come over on boats '' line was just as ridiculous as any of the ridiculous racist shit i 've heard about obama . 
  how did you even reach such a hyperbolic exaggerated perspective , anyway ? 
  do you really think europe is just so incredible and perfect that * everybody * is waiting in line to come over , or something like that ? 
  it 's almost baffling . 
  i can understand the lunatics here in the us , but even they 're not as afraid of immigrants as y' all sem to be . 
  anyways , anyways ... 
  the us did n't create the crisis in syria ; assad did , by murdering peaceful protesters , which eventually caused a civil war that birthed isis . 
  isis then spread east as the us withdrew from iraq and had to actually conquer the iraqis , but it 's completely ridiculous to say that we were responsible for the creation of isis . 
  and i 've already admitted that the us should express more responsibility for helping refugees , the state of syria , and the state of iraq . 
  it 's definitely a shame that we are n't helping more , but you know better than to resort to `` whataboutisms '' , so i wo n't go too far off on that tangent , as a benefit to both of us . 
  no , trust me , i 'm ashamed of the us ' lack of response . 
  it 's definitely shitty . 
  i 'm definitely of the opinion that we should be taking in a screaming ton more . 
  but it 's not fucking like anywhere in the eu or us is taking any number even remotely comparable to turkey , jordan , and lebanon , so w/e . 
  on the other hand , we do have ** 11 million ** illegal mexicans , and there sure as fuck is n't any semantic argument about whether they 're `` war refugees '' or `` economic migrants '' , so make of that what you will . 
  it 's just a biological fact that online newspapers attract insane right-wingers . 
  truly bizarre ; it definitely happens here in the us , too . 
  and they 're * all just waiting to kick down your door and slep on your couch * xd what the fuck ever , man . 
  this shit is so beyond ridiculous compared to what even the most terrified old ladies of florida say that i just ca n't take it seriously . 
  yeah . 
  an entire 10 % of the african continent is just * waiting * for the chance to live on germany 's welfare system . 
  sure thing . 
  here 's how i see it . 
  nothing will stop the refugees . 
  nothing . 
  nothing nothing nothing . 
  they are like people trapped in burning skyscrapers ; they will eventually jump out and hope to survive rather than stay and burn to death . 
  therefore , the mass presence of ** refugees ** in europe is a given , and nothing short of complete totalitarianism and german reich-esqu politics will change that . 
  so germany says , `` we will do as much as we possibly can , and highly encourage others to do what can , because we understand very goddamn well what it 's like to be on the other side of a crisis like this . '', 
  refugees are normal human beings . 
  a few years ago , they had lives that were probably more similar to yours than you 'd ever be willing to admit , especially regarding syrians .
