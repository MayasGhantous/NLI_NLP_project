  it 's not surprising at all that a lot of them have smartphones that are several years old , given how goddamned cheap they are nowadays . 
  it 's not exactly a symbol of luxury anymore . 
  because, 
  ## ** [ citation needed ] **, 
  really , spain should be asking for independence from catalonia . 
  ^ / s there are other ways to harm a `` colony '' than just financially . 
  how much has use of non-castillian language deteriorated since spanish rule began , for instance ? 
  just compare irish gaelic in ireland and northern ireland . 
  * [ swallows patriotic pride ] * and the uk * generally * was n't as horrifying to its colonis as its contemporary colonial powers . 
  the slave trade lived through spain and portugal , belgium cut off everyone 's hands , and france ... has a few things to be completely embarrassed about . 
   the us was a huge , smaller than europe excluding hawaii and alaska  sparsely populated continent ; no  we 're already 507 million in the eu and some 700 million in europe . 
  well ; great news !, 
  if you 're feeling crowded , or shit deteriorates too badly , you can come to the us as an * economic migrant * , you welfare queen ~ !, 
  :d  housing is expensive and with the same money instead of paying for rent for 3-4 years you could build and donate houses and apartments for these people , elsewhere . 
  y' all could . 
  but you wo n't . 
  and the reality is that you ca n't stop the flow of people . 
  unless you want to go full north korea . 
  that fact is n't changing . 
   you see , the eu , unlike the us , does n't have an army . 
  the logical thing to do would be to act like the regional power that it is and impose peace and stability on neighboring countries . 
  it 's kind of hard to take this seriously . 
   by the millions and by the tens of millions and by the hundreds of millions this century . 
  oh my god lol ** hundreds ** of millions ? 
  you do n't feel even a little bad for such horrendously belligerent hyperbole ? 
  wow . 
  wow . 
  grade a fear-mongering , right there . 
  truly incredible . 
  we do n't even get that sort of shit with the mexicans in the us . 
  and what exactly is your vision ? 
  a hundred million brown muslims living in germany all living on welfare 100 years from now ? 
  i have n't heard something that ridiculous since i heard obama was gon na turn america into a muslim theocracy . 
  it 's almost hilarious how directly comparable the terror is here . 
   it 's not just refugees but economic immigrants who would risk their lives as well if they have illusions about how easy life is here and how easy they can get in . 
  y' know america and oceania have taken in about 500 million * economic migrants * in the past few centuries . 
  here 's an idea . 
  why do n't we just take the 500 or so white europeans who are just scared shitless of syrians in europe to keep them safe ? 
  catalonia is europe , or at least a part of it . 
  this piece of europe is trying to become something independent . 
  it 's a little bit different , though , because the level of democratic participation is n't going to change this particular situation . 
  fences and guns are n't going to change the situation , either . 
  there is absolutely nothing that can prevent the refugees from reaching almost anywhere in the eu . 
  we have very firmly established that they are willing to die for a chance at a better life . 
  in this case , it does n't matter whether california imposes on other states or not . 
  the refugees in europe are a fact at this point . 
  not a choice . 
  the next question is how you help them , harass them , or ignore them ... and if it were up to / r/europe , donald trump would probably be president of the eu . 
  it 's really quite incredible , though . 
  over the course of two or three hundred years , america and oceania took in about five hundred million refugees from europe . 
  every goddamn single group was told that they would never be able to integrate and that they would just be a drain on the economy , but then , by some weird divine magic , they integrated over the course of decades became the foundation of their economies . 
  `` no , ** this ** time it 's different !, 
  for realsies ! '', 
  how many middle-eastern refugees has europe taken since 2011 ? 
  less than turkey ? 
  i ca n't believe the eu is being outdone that easily . 
  i have full faith in the eu with germany at the helm . 
  the reactionary lunatics in this sub do n't represent the general eu population . 
  time will pass , and the fear-mongering will be less effective . 
  i could n't pick a better country to lead the eu than germany . 
  i 've had nothing but respect for the way they 've been handling this `` crisis '' . 
  no , yeah , that 's generally my opinion . 
  i probably should 've explicitly indicated how much i think that other dude is filled with shit . 
  of course the eu is n't so goddamned weak-willed that this crisis is going to tear it apart . 
  that dude is just a fucking lunatic who 's just scared of syrians/refugees . 
  integration wo n't happen in two months ; it 'll take many many years . 
  but they will eventually pay for themselves ... especially considering germany 's natural-born declining population . 
   a ) opinion has shifted massively to the right on this sub lately ho , brah , i have . 
  anybody with even a quarter of a wit has noticed as far as i 'm concerned . 
  i 'm just enjoying taking the piss out of all these lunatics . 
  is n't it weird how white nationalists always talk about how white `` culture '' is the greatest in the world , yet oddly somehow always in a state of existentialist terror in doom ? 
  i 'd think that if white `` culture '' were really as noble and great as these people try to make it seem that there would n't be any need for worry . 
   b ) so many people talk for/about germany who are n't even german as long as they 're seemingly smug assholes , i like to compare them to donald trump and illegal mexican immigrants , except even donald trump is less hysterical and less racist about the ` crisis ' than / r/europe and / r/worldnews . 
   c ) this sub is not represantative of all of public opinion . 
  i definitely have to bash this fact into my brain every once in a while , but there 's definitely some real-world differences in how the `` crisis '' is being handled by different european nations . 
  i can fully understand why refugees do n't want to hang out in hungary , and my respect for germany has skyrocketed over the past month or so ( despite being at a pretty low point during the greek crisis ) . 
  most of the news that i read on , well , * actual * news websites are a lot more reality-based than this place . 
  though maybe the bbc , reuters , nytimes , hawaii news , aljazeera , and aljazeera america have all just been taken over by the ** white guilt librul media ** . 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af and yeah , op 's shit attitude is infantile . 
  at the worst , he should * hope * germany will succeed with its program and * expect * it to fail , but why in fucking god 's name would he hope for failure unless he just had pure contempt for the refugees ? 
  we have 50 , though puerto rico 's next in line . 
  and honestly ? 
  my respect for germany has skyrocketed in the past couple months . 
  i think they 'd be just fine on their own . 
  ^ ( ca n't say the same for the faroe islands ), 
  wow . 
  i had no idea the european union was so fragile and weak-willed . 
  let 's just kick germany out of the eu !, 
  waitwaitwaitwaitwait you 're in * support * of this so that you can see it fail ? 
  instead of actually solving a problem , you just want to teach germany a lesson or something ? 
   so for many people , catalan nationalism is the highly privileged kid that gets upset because his dad bought him a mercedes and he wanted a bmw . 
  of course , some politicians have exploited and encouraged these emotions , especially in regional politics as none of your voters are catalan . 
  why would n't these people be in favor of catalonia * leaving * , then ? 
  i mean , i can think of a lot of benefits . 
  it 's not like portugal is n't compared to greece because of their beaches or any shit like that . 
   i can give very good reasons for us to be in the eu oi , yeah , and about a billion skeptics can give very good reasons for why the eu is n't necessarily the end-all be-all of political treaties for a variety of political , cultural , militaristic , and economic problems . 
  many of which gravely concern that country that sometimes gets compared to greece . 
  and anyways ; not every fucking thing is dollar bills , y' know . 
  the reasons for wanting independence go far beyond what 's in their weekly paycheck . 
  again , the absolute most basic reason for independence is if * they want it .
