  * how far are you willing to go to force catalonia into spain `` for their own good '' ? 
  will you ignore a referendum if 60 % wants independence ? 
  will you start a war if they declare independence anyways ? 
  even if their will is irational , you absolutely fucking have to respect the democratic process and the populations ' ( not individuals ) right to self-determination . 
  if the catalonians decide they do n't give a shit about your advice , you still need to respect their choice . 
  europe definitely has serious problems , and nobody 's trying to take away from that , but y' all have dealt with far ** far ** worse shit before . 
  in fact , over the past 300 or so years , things have been shitty enough for nearly ** five hundred fucking million ** people to run away in terror from europe . 
  ^ [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_diaspora ) it 's not like it 's impossible for the fortunes to be reversed , either . 
  north african/middle eastern/central african populations are exploding , and they could easily become greater powers in the world in 100 or so years if things go well , and maybe someday europe will rely on foreign aid again . 
  ... and every * single * person who says that europeans and middle easterners will never be able to get along can go straight to hell . 
  i think maybe the european sub got a huge bump after the / r/coontown ban . 
  they seem a lot more prevalent and popular on / r/europe lately . 
  it 's sometimes kinda funny though , when a / r/europe ^ an will start talking shit about how awful and racist trump/american politics are , and then you take a peak in this sub and it 's all `` 8000 syrians will rape and destroy all that is good and pure about germany they 're almost as bad as the roma '' . 
  but i get it . 
  it 's hard to accept , but this sub is n't representative of a `` general '' european population . 
  my respect for germany has skyrocketed over the past couple months , and i only wish the us could step up its humanitarian efforts to match . 
  we 've already got 11 million southern rapists in our borders , what 's another 100k or so gon na hurt ? 
  what are the arguments of spaniards that oppose the secession of `` their '' territory ? 
  i do n't get the feeling that it 's any sort of altruism . 
  jeez , imperito , you have absolutely * no * chill on this matter . 
  man , it 's weird learning how colonialism and imperialism stuck around for so long in the minds of people because of some random reddit comments . 
  why * should n't * the uk rule over the us , canada , india , australia , and new zealand ? 
  what 's wrong with some guy born and bred in london ruling over oklahoma city ? 
  it just sounds like petty pride . 
  you 're from portugal . 
  can you give a good reason why portugal should n't cede its sovereignty to spain ? 
  herp derp europe does that well enough without our help, 
  the right to self-determination ? 
  what ? 
  i do n't even understand the point that you 're trying to make . 
  are you comparing the ~ ~ refugees ~ ~ ~ ~ economic welfare queens ~ ~ refugees to gangsters or something ? 
  / r/europe sees a man tickling an adorable child `` this is a terrible awful thing . 
  their lives are n't in danger in pakistan , bangladesh , eritrea , and afghanistan ? 
  what ? 
  so what ? 
  are you making the argument that those refugees * do n't * have a legitimate claim for asylum in the eu ? 
  reactionaries are always so sensitive about everything . 
  i do n't understand why you 're being so dismissive of his entirely lukewarm and highly conditional support . 
  well , you have to assume that the immigrants are gon na come in no matter , more or less . 
  so the question kinda becomes `` okay , how many of these guys should we legally process ? '', 
  well , wait . 
  what happens when the scots get all `` fak u m8 '' and split off into a separate party from england ? 
  we could just switch out puerto rico and ireland . 
  i do n't think anyone would notice . 
   and if the west is n't willing to end it the right way ( with neither assad nor isis ) what exactly do you mean by this , out of curiosity ? 
  i 'd count the us and eu as pretty distinct entities as far as syria is concerned . 
  why do people jump when they 're in burning buildings ? 
  blind cynicism is just as bad as blind idealism . 
  it is ** entirely ** possible to have both . 
  like in france ? 
  he 's just stirring up an argument about racism for no fucking reason whatsoever, 
  excuse me , sir , but ** rabblerabblerabble ** . 
  ## dey took er jerbs, 
  \\ # 1 on the sub right now . 
  still loving it ? 
  american here rabble rabble rabble canada is a noob, 
  are there people that * do n't * like cheese ? 
  and can they really be called `` people '' ? 
  ## [ ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u256d \u035c\u0296 \u256e \u0361 \u00b0 ) you mess with the bull , you get its horn .

  too bad i do n't have those ... superior german genetics ^ ( if you get an erection , we 'll shoot . ), 
  you 're just racist against people of other visions . 
  yes , well , * boxboxboxboxboxboxboxboxbox * to you too , sir !, 
  good day !, 
  but you did n't include a blind version , either . 
  but the earlier red-white-blue flag is a lot different than the modern red-white-blue flag , since the red and the blue are clearly different . 
  the orange flag also uses the old blue hue . 
  [ there 's the statenvlag , the old red-white-blue ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/statenvlag.svg/2000px-statenvlag.svg.png ) [ the oranje flag , orange-white-old blue ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/prinsenvlag.svg/2000px-prinsenvlag.svg.png ) [ the flag of the kingdom of holland , ruled by louis bonaparte ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/flag_of_the_netherlands.svg/900px-flag_of_the_netherlands.svg.png ) [ ... and the modern flag . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/flag_of_the_netherlands.svg/900px-flag_of_the_netherlands.svg.png ) the current hues are clearly inspired by napoleon 's hues . 
  but the modern flag is the one that 's clearly more identical to the kingdom of holland than the statenvlag , so it 's french-based . 
  you could have at least changed the order , like ~ ~ belgium ~ ~ germany did . 
  ^ ( and no , i ca n't teach you the secrets of american hieroglyphics . ), 
  they 're only metaphorically humans , is what he meant . 
  i 'm just talking about current incantations . 
  i 'm being nice by not getting historical , because y' all have an extremely solid track record of [ fucking up flags . 
  ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/i/it-2ss.gif ) and besides ; do n't both of the flags we 're talking about have a much lighter blue hue ? 
  there 's oranje 's flag , which has a light blue , and inspired new york city 's flag , and the `` statenvlag '' , which is red white light blue . 
  or is it that you motherfuckers were just trying to double-dip and have * two * flags ; one with orange , and one with red ? 
  because that 's some bullshit , netherlands . 
  you ca n't have two flags . 
  seriously ? 
  no color-blind version ? 
  the dutch republic is the orangje one , right ? 
  netherlands had the option of going for the orange or red flag after napoleon , but went for the red one culturally . 
  the orange flag would n't have mimicked the french flag the way the red one does . 
  absolutely absurd . 
  the dutch flag originates from the french as a direct result of napoleon 's ass-kicking . 
  when napoleon conquered the netherlands , he turned it into a puppet state to be ruled by his brother louis , who adopted the tricolor . 
  you guys had the option of going for the orange flag once napoleon went on his vacation , and i 'm pretty sure the orange flag inspired south africa 's flag , but idk you guys had stockholm syndrom or something and went with napoleon 's design instead . 
  seriously , though . 
  how is it that the ** netherlands ** does n't use the flag design with ** orange ** on it ? 
  when i think of netherlands , i do n't think `` red , white and blue '' , i think `` oh , look !, 
  king orange of house oranje is eating an orange without peeling the skin first !, 
  what a quirky individual . 
  orange . '', 
  how can germany claim your swamps if your flag is just a sideways france ? 
  something , something , swamp germans something , something , frogs,
