sunlight is the best antiseptic . 
  yep ... shady as shit . 
  no , i think you are correct . 
  [ according to this guardian article ... ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/us-ukraine-russia-eu-victoria-nuland ) she was on the line with our ( us ) ambassador to ukraine . 
  she was , indeed , frustrated that the eu was n't moving fast enough on sanctions , as you said . 
  the russian connection i mistook was that the russians are believed to have leaked the conversation , they probably had the line tapped . 
  my mistake . 
  then lets just hope the ukrainian government does n't implement the redeker plan . 
  i thought she was on the phone with a russian embassy official on an ( possibly ) unrelated issue . 
  am i incorrect ? 
  just an irrational phobia . 
  yah , because you ca n't buy [ flushible wet wipes ] ( http://c3.soap.com/images/products/p/px/px-258_1z.jpg ) in every target , walmart , grocery store , and even most corner stores in the entire united states . 
   it 's polite to fold the dirty side of the paper shut , but often people do n't . 
  awww . 
  that 's just ... rank . 
  what ... oh god ... what do they do with it after they are ... done ? 
  yah , i saw this horror flick when i was a kid about some electricity ghost ( i guess ? ), 
  trying to kill the new home owners ... 
  this one scene , the ghost makes the disposal go on to get a big piece of glass in the sink to vibrate * into * the disposal and it * ricochets back up * and hits a guy in the head and kills him . 
  i have n't been able to turn one on with my face above it since . 
   they have this weird sink with a blender built-in . 
  lol ... yah , but it 's a lot handier than a letting the soggy food particles accumulate and then throw , dripping , into the trash . 
  some apartments do n't have them , but they are very common . 
  we do n't really grind up any large items in 'em , just small stuff . 
   this may sound strange to some , but for me , england . 
  i thought since english is the common language between our countries , that really we would n't be that different . 
  turns out we are . 
  can you elaborate on those differences ? 
  do n't forget diseased horses from texas . 
  you could either use [ stv ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_transferable_vote ) for each house delegation , you vote for a person , not party , and it 's proportional representation . 
  for single-winner races ( prez , gov , senator ) a preferential system , like an instant run-off , is 3rd party friendly . 
  as canada , where money in politics is properly controlled , has moved away from proportional or preferential in the provinces , so too have they parties slowly become more consolidated . 
  fptp rewards such behavior . 
   because of the electoral college it 's nearly impossible for them to be elected . 
  we only use that for president . 
  we have a two party system for a reason , our voting system . 
  we use a ` first past the post ' or a [ plurality ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plurality_voting_system ) voting system for all elections . 
  a [ preferential system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/preferential_voting ) ( think [ instant run-off ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/instant-runoff_voting ) ) , for single winner races , like governor , senator , president , etc. 
  would allow for 3rd parties without a ` spoiler effect ' . 
  when we vote for a state 's house delegation , they chop the state into single winner districts . 
  instead we could choice it [ proportionallly ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proportional_representation ) . 
  with our system , if say , 10 percent of a state is libertarian or green , but not clumped together in one district , but dispersed thru-out the state , they can never get 10 percent of the seats . 
  most western democracies allow for 3rd party viability by using one or both of those systems . 
  not because of how they elect ( or do n't have ) a president , or because they have a parliament . 
  the uk and canada also use winner-take-all , but have places like quebec or northern ireland , which consider themselves apart from the larger nation and form region specific 3rd parties . 
  they also curtail the ill effects of winner-take-all , somewhat , by employing more open 3rd party ballot access , mandatory public campaign financing , and independent councils drawing the districts . 
  we do almost none of those , or do them weakly . 
   anyway , we started this conversation talking about high earners . 
  i do n't think they 're going to be the ones making money on ss and medicare . 
  they definitely are not , but that would n't bump there tax rate up to a real 50 percent , even in the worst case scenario -  unlucky generation + high income earners . 
  not even close . 
  rich or poor , everyone gets a significant amount in services and money back after age 70 . 
  that is more fluff than anything else . 
  here is the only thing you need to remember on the subject : old people have nothing else to do but vote . 
  they are not to be fucked with . 
  the republicans and the democrats will never ever shot themselves in the foot , or they will be out next election , and the program restored by some solution or other . 
  end of story . 
  they rest is just a political circle jerk of failed ` reform ' bills that never get passed to give a hand-job to a particular constituency . 
  even when the republicans propose some bullshit ~ ~ cut ~ ~ ` reform ' , that never passes , it only applies to the younger generation , because they are so afraid of current retirees . 
  you did n't deduct ss and medicare , huh ? 
  you ca n't exactly include them because depending on lifetime income , you [ may make money on those ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/feb/01/medicare-and-social-security-what-you-paid-what-yo/ ) - if your poor to middle class . 
  or take a hit if you are upper middle to wealthy . 
  the pay-in vs. pay-out ratio , overall , is further complicated ( to your favor or not ) by what generation you are a member of , too , due to currency and cost fluctuations over the decades . 
  your brother is probably talking about his * marginal * tax rate . 
  even then , though , income tax in the [ us tops out at 39 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/income_tax_in_the_united_states#marginal_tax_rates_for_2015 ) so your brother is incorrect there . 
  and that 's * only * for anything over 410k ( ruffly ) . 
  with marginal ( vs effective ) the stuff * over * x amount goes up to the next bracket rate , the money under that amount is taxed at a lower percentage . 
  you understand ? 
  the * effective * tax rate ( the real rate , flat out ) we all pay is way under that : [ here is a chart of the average effective tax rate . 
  ] ( http://taxfoundation.org/blog/chart-day-effective-tax-rates-income-category ) people making over a million only pay about 23 % . 
  100k to 250k is only like 13 % . 
  / u/dr _ shitlordmd may be talking about effective rate - their shit is pretty high , but i would have thought he is saying marginal rate ... unless hes super wealthy or something . 
  but he gets healthcare and lots of services in the deal tho , too ,

  what is your current social security system like ? 
  you have n't seen spartacus on stars . 
  every episode requires at least three . 
  hey , skuma sales * are * a job .

  what always motivates the actions of the world 's nation 's ? 
  self interest . 
  i think at that point , we had troops split between the pacific theatre and europe , and most of western europe 's troops were not in good shape , if not in shambles in some places . 
  the only options at that point was to split up europe or turn on the russians and nuke russia into the stone age before they had a chance to react . 
  it would have been messy as hell , and we still would have needed to mop up the red army in germany and eastern europe . 
  that is a long , bloody , and uncertain prospect . 
  a ww2 enthusiast or / r/askhistorians might be able to provide more insight , but i can say it would have been a very dark bloody path to take . 
  it was that or go to war with russia , who are tough sons of bitches with conventional weapons alone . 
  the two largest powers , with massive nuclear arsenals pointed at each other and our respective ` allies ' and or client states . 
  it was 45 years of occupation for you , or worldwide nuclear armageddon for everyone .

  well , in new orleans you can ... maybe los vegas too , i forget . 
  but yah , some of those puritanical bullshit laws in most states are annoying . 
  it 's a vestigial remnant of prohibition era ( 1920s ) that needs to go . 
   europe also does n't have many spare islands to build ~ ~ detention camps . ~ ~ happy camps . 
  you have to get in front of bad pr early . 
  the germans have some experience here . 
  and ibm can offer logistics and keep track of everything . 
  i 'd suggest foreign ( non-eu ) soil , like guantanamo ... a stable north african country that does n't ask many questions .
