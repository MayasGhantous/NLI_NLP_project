  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28400218  but the gas industry , space technology and nuclear energy are excluded from sanctions . 
  edit : even better , moar pipelines to russia . 
  more energy dependancy . 
  it 's the same shit when we ask europe to spend more on the military . 
  `` but we do n't want to reinforce the us military industrial complex . '', 
  no one is forcing you buy shit from us . 
  buy european weapons , buy canadian oil . 
  people think the us is pushing for self benefit which is partially true , but it 's primarily for the benefit of europeans . 
  why would you want to reliant on the us for your own security and be reliant on russia out of all countries for energy . 
  cool plane , was very thrown off by the english . 
  germany is tough on russia until money is involved . 
  sanctions were clearly toothless if they did n't impact the energy market . 
   the us destiblisation of the middle east is what caused all this in the first place . 
  you mean france right ? 
  france insisted on bombing libya to hell which opened the floodgates . 
  also the syrian civil war is the main cause of the refugee crisis and that has little to do with the usa . 
  ya 'll are about to sanction ee for not taking in refugees . 
  i honestly think everyone would be shocked at how bad every country would be if these mobilization efforts were on the spot without 6 months prep . 
  this sub is pretty far left on any issue except for refugees/immigration . 
  countries turn and tumble all the time and recover . 
  i hope turkey can do the same . 
  course that just means turkey will become even shittier . 
  it 's funny , the euro debt crisis and brexit dealt massive blows to the eu , yet the refugee crisis is entirely self inflicted and will most likely deal the biggest blow of all . 
  the other one after being deleted is at 1050 comments while this one is at 250 . before the deletion the old one was at 800 while this one was at 50 . it 's a pretty severe difference . 
  the hell did the mods delete the much bigger post and leave this one up, 
  how exactly am i not true ? 
  there are thousands coming every week . 
  like i said based on your graph i 'm correct . 
  also the turkey refugee deal could fall apart any second , the turks and eu do n't exactly have a good relationship nowadays . 
  based on those numbers there are still hundreds of thousands migrants coming in every year . 
  there is n't a point to agreeing until the migrant inflow is 0 and the borders are secure without the help of erdogan . 
  what 's the point of distribution if there are thousands more coming every week ? 
  would n't it be a endless stream ? 
  the only way redistributions make sense is if there are no more new migrants . 
  new elections probably . 
  just banging heads at this point . 
   indeed if it was not for the urss the us would be free to use it 's atomic bomb and it 's overpowered military . 
  the mutually assured destruction protected a lot of people from war . 
  what ? 
  the usa had the nuke alone for 3 years after ww2 . 
  they simply chose not to start another war . 
  you 're right , the nh90 is n't the biggest european clusterfuck program . 
  nothing comes close to the a400m . 
  multi-country cooperation makes no sense if every country wants like 20 different things . 
  that 's why theres literally 20 variants for the nh90 . 
  i 'm probably overly harsh on the nh90 . 
  they do n't want to reveal the role of f-22 's because that shit is classified . 
  revealing the tactics of your planes is stupid . 
  obviously the f-35 b did n't fly with the f-22 in a maritime exercise . 
  i think it 's really really important to remember red flag is a multinational program . 
  most european countries , australia , india , japan show up . 
  also , i swear it 's like people recycle talking points . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/n230b/til_a_war_game_was_conducted_in_2002_which/c35pi5r/ read this and then tell me what you think about the 2002 challenge . 
  even if we accept that the us sometime rigs domestic wargames , how the fuck would it rig an international event ? 
  okay , how about the dutch march 2014 ? 
  https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/dutch-maritime-nh90s-suffer-corrosion-397191/ or australia in 2015 . http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2015-10-22/australian-mrh-90-helicopter-problems-aired germany in 2015 . https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/germany-calls-a-halt-to-nh90-flights-over-safety-fea-408844/ finland in 2015 http://airheadsfly.com/2015/01/24/finland-struggling-to-keep-nh90s-airborne/, 
  ok , how about this . 
  the f-35 naval variant that did n't fly with the f-22 against other naval aircraft scored a kda of 24-0 . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgljnsb_hym&amp;t=5s https://theaviationist.com/2016/12/08/four-of-the-most-experienced-usmc-f-35b-pilots-speak-about-their-aircraft-and-they-say-its-exceptional/,

   what the carrier will do ? 
  they cant start any jet . 
  use rockets on each drone ? 
  ... good luck cwis or in the us case , laser weapons . 
  http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/2015-30-year-old-french-nuclear-submarine-sank-us-aircraft-18912 us carriers get sunk a lot in practice training because the exercise is trying to find weaknesses . 
  wib is an absolute stupid site and has no idea what they 're talking about . 
  but i just told you drones can not destroy jets . 
  i too , can use google . 
  2 of your sources are repeating the exact same information from wib . 
  you literally just googled this and posted it , you did n't even read your sources . 
  also the f-22 , f-18 , f-16 all have had oxygen problems in the past . 
  not a big deal . 
   red flag . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgljnsb_hym 90 % of that information is outdated after the debrief . 
  read this comment and talk about the mil challenge 2002 again . 
  no , but they know much more information than / r/europe . 
  i was n't even claiming they would offer unbiased information . 
  anyone who studies military sources for longer than a day knows warisboring is an absolute clown site . 
  a big political aircraft that scores 20.7-1 kda on the recent air exercise ? 
  ok then . 
  here is wib claiming that disel subs are the way forward . 
  lmao , warisboring , how predictable . 
  do yourself a favour and post that shit in an actual military forum . 
  you 'll be laughed out of the forum for posting unreliable tabloid garbage . 
  how about an actual military exercise where the f-35 scored 20.7-1 kda . 
  https://theaviationist.com/2017/02/28/red-flag-confirmed-f-35-dominance-with-a-201-kill-ratio-u-s-air-force-says/ in fact , here . 
  https://i.imgur.com/p562aob.jpg do n't repeat any of these things if you want to talk about military matters . 
  i 'm sorry , but you have 0 idea what you 're talking about and posting from warisboring reinforces that . 
  drones ca n't do more than bomb something or do recon . 
   airbus produces formidable civilian planes with production being spread across europe too . 
  civilian and military production is n't close to the same thing . 
  netherlands , norway , uk , italy , denmark . 
  nh90 literally just had a chopper engine blow up 2 months ago . 
  this is a complete misconception that is 100 % false . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  here is denmark 's analysis of the f-35 versus other planes . 
  http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5739ef8d52bcd01f7b8c2e08-895-730/screen%20shot%202016-05-16%20at%2012.00.21%20pm.png http://www.ainonline.com/sites/default/files/uploads/2017/01/chart3_lmt-jan-2017-conf-call-webcharts-web.jpg f-35 cost chart , eventually 85 mil a pop . 
  cheaper than rafale by a decent chunk . 
  http://forum.keypublishing.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=223978 saab opinion on planes , ignore the cost of the gripen n/g , projected cost is like 85mil unit cost . 
  edit : here is a russian military expert talking about the f-35 ( subtitles ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scm_rn9a-js edit2 : people are claiming that the usa is rigging an international competition that like 10 countries fly in . 
  the earth is flat .
