  and i do n't know if political eu is an english site , but here . 
   a spokesman for the german government on monday denied media reports that u.s. president donald trump handed a multibillion-euro invoice to chancellor angela merkel when they met in washington earlier this month . 
  `` reports that president trump had presented the federal chancellor with a kind of bill with a concrete billion sum are not true , '' spokesman steffen seibert said at a press conference . 
  who 's presenting fake news now ? 
  sure that would work if you also stopped the intake of refugees and figured a way to stop them from leaving and going to germany a week later . 
  sanctions are a far more serious thing than a simple disagreement . 
  also the bar is n't `` hey we 're not at war !, 
  that 's unity . '', 
  not really , sweden has something like 50 % of rejected assylum seekers stay there iirc . 
  they terrorist who attacked stockholm was a rejected assyulm seeker . 
  http://www.politico.eu/article/half-of-rejected-asylum-seekers-stay-in-germany-asylum-refugee/ germany not sweden . 
  i imagine it 's worse for sweden . 
  and they stay in europe anyways . 
  am i saying put refugees on a pacific island ? 
  no , you asked for a solution . 
  this is the template . 
  be it renting a piece of land from african nations or greek islands that are used to create safe refugees camps . 
  thanks , i think i 'll wait out trump instead . 
  there was that story about the 300 billion nato bill notice thing that turned out to be false that everyone ate up like cheese so forgive me for being skeptical . 
  usa position itself against eu returning migrants ? 
  are you serious ? 
  trump hates mena migrants lol . 
  and beyond that it 's not really a hostile takeover lol ... 
  oh yeah , we can reach the moon but we ca n't enforce the borders . 
  does n't it speak volumes about the harmony of europe when you 're referring to different sections as `` core europe , '' and eastern european authoritarianism ? 
  what ? 
  i 'm making a joke about how they 're not actually syrians . 
  fifth biggest economy in the world ?? 
  can you really say that in this thread where the eu might throw sanctions at four of its members along with brexit ? 
  it 's actually not . 
  an eu defense pact already exists , it 's part of the eu . 
  this is about an eu military integration . 
  sure how would you change the way you integrate them . 
  keep in mind with the exception of mena refugees/migrants , this is n't a problem with say east asia immigrants . 
  eu defense pact already exists , this is just about having an integrated eu military . 
  and nato will 100 % still exist . 
  what 's going to change between old arrivals and new arrivals ? 
  well obviously , they travel through many safe countries/embark on a dangerous boat ride to get to germany . 
  they do n't speak the language , they only mingle with their own cultural group , they live on welfare , have no job , they commit disproportionate amounts of crimes ( especially rapes ) , and the cherry on top they commit terror attacks . 
   where do you come from ? 
  syria  which city ? 
  90 % answer aleppo  can you name a street in aleppo ? 
  immigration is causing integration problems . 
  no one said it 's going to stop terrorism completely , but if you have a problem with integration and homegrown terrorism , inviting more people in is going to make the problem worse . 
  do explain . 
  yeah but 100 % alone ? 
  i do n't see it . 
  there were 40 divisions in france to garrison against an allied invasion , lend lease , strategic bombing and thousands of planes lost in the bob . 
  f-16 is n't actually that cheap . 
  https://imgur.com/8twmyyk and the cost is projected to come down for the f-35 . 
  20-1 at red flag = underperforming . 
  that 's fair , i consider it a stretch . 
  soviets by the end of the war was completely devastated and contrary to popular knowledge was tapped out of manpower . 
  it was a joke . 
  and yes most of them have been fixed . 
  goin full putin . 
  yeah but the f-35 is known for having no cost overruns and delays . 
  let 's be honest , with the exception of like , saudia arabia , everything else would be considered racist . 
  well is n't that the point of ripping up human rights laws ? 
  make em legal ? 
  funding police properly wo n't do much actually . 
  there are literally 10s of thousands of terror suspects with more being home grown every day . 
  uk already has the most money spent on intelligence and counter terrorism forces . 
  police have very little to do with stopping shit like this anyways . 
  even if they were effective it 's only a band aid that does n't address the metaphoric disease . 
  if i wanted to stop terror in the future i would first ban all foreign funding for mosques , two ban anyone who leaves the uk to fight in syria or whatever , and then look at immigration bans . 
  i blame stalin , he got scared of zhukov 's popularity and basically sacked him post ww2 . 
  lol, 
  you 're comparing subsidies to the net trade between two countries ? 
   see anything european here ? 
  https://www.f35.com/news/detail/first-italian-built-f-35b-rolls-out-of-cameri-production-facility looks italian to me . 
  just incase you still have any concerns . 
  here is denmark 's judgement on [ performance ] ( http://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/05/screen-shot-2016-05-12-at-9.58.41-am.png ) and [ flying costs ] ( http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/573a0b7452bcd05b008c329f-412-581/screen%20shot%202016-05-16%20at%2012.04.47%20pm.png ) falling f-35 [ cost ] ( https://gyazo.com/027af11129df63c68681e6c11e8dedc9 ) projected to be around 85 million once finished . 
  here is saab 's opinion on fighters [ here ] ( https://gyazo.com/112873d20dae686dccdfe25445927c4e ) a video on the f-16 be questioned as junk [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkrtxddawum ) i could go on and on but i save that for when i post on defense forums :p also sorry i 'm using gyazo for 2 images , photobucket is banned on this sub . 
   i personally do n't like how close business ties we have with the usa . 
  it 's pretty much just military ties . 
  the two trade between our country is 10 billion annually , which is n't very much . 
  https://theaviationist.com/2017/02/28/red-flag-confirmed-f-35-dominance-with-a-201-kill-ratio-u-s-air-force-says/ 90 % of planes have cost overrun and delays , even the f-16 had these issues . 
  f-22 is non export . 
  and gripen is 4 . 
  i mean i agree , but poland is still relatively a small economy so going for a fifth generation plane is newsworthy i think . 
  why change what 's working ? 
   land lease was effective ? 
  united kingdom got 3x times help soviet union got ? 
  why did n't they get to berlin 3x faster ? 
  because it 's an island and amphibious invasions are very hard in modern time let alone ww2 era . 
  https://perspectivesofthepast.com/europe-in-the-era-of-the-world-wars/the-significance-of-the-allied-lend-lease-program-and-soviet-victory-during-the-second-world-war/  in a confidential interview with the wartime correspondent konstantin simonov , the famous soviet marshal g.k. zhukov is quoted as sayin g `` today [ 1963 ] some say the allies did n't really help us ... but listen , one can not deny that the americans shipped over to us material without which we could not have equipped our armies held in reserve or been able to continue the war . '' [ 12 ] marshall zhukov according to weeks even goes on further to state that the soviet government engaged in the calculated use of propaganda to systemically demean the importance of the allied lend-lease program , believing that it distracted from the heroism and sacrifice of the soviet soldier and people . 
  i would trust zhukov 's word would n't you ? 
  f-35 is n't really standard equipment upgrade is it ? 
  you have a source on her mother being a muslim ? 
  nato is a mutual defense treaty , it works best when both sides are equals . 
  he 's referring to refugees . 
  that 's fair , i did n't consider the capita point . 
  no problem . 
  it 's good to dvelve into sources . 
  the friend of my friend is my friend . 
  iat is pure trash . 
  one man 's terrorist is another mans rebel . 
  explains the us foreign policy pretty well actually . 
  let 's not forget the manchester attackers ' father was fighting against ghadaffi along side the british ... .
