  people really like to overreact . 
  happyness, 
  it 's my duty . 
  i did swear allegiance to house usa . 
  dang , i 'm really bad at detecting sarcasm . 
  my bad . 
  wat is this doing on / r/europe . 
  obviously immigrants will have teething issues . 
  it 's unrealistic to expect 100 % integration compared to ethnic germans , however there is a level of cost/benefit between different groups of refugees/immigrants/migrants . 
   people like to shit on algerians but the truth still remains that in absolute numbers germans are way more likely to be assaulted by eu citizens . 
  do you really want to tell to women that were raped or families of those murdered that the open border policy is not bad because those 2000 gambians are more likely to rape someone than those 1.5 million poles ? 
  i would say the per capita assaults/crime matter more than the raw numbers . 
  edit : just fyi i 'm not downvoting you . 
  i 'd say sorry , but i 'm not canadian . 
  and trumps ' americans are 2x likely to commit sexual assault compared to native germans . 
  sarcasm across different cultures/languages is already hard to detect , compound it further with the internet , it 's really hard to tell sometimes . 
   would you be complaining if they brought up canada instead ? 
  naw , i 'd leave it to canadians to apologize . 
  i hope germany can snap out of it , before more terror attacks force them to . 
  wtf . 
  this graph is horrible . 
  why is it making it seem like the % are the exact same ? 
  per capita would be a lot lot lot better . 
  would have postponed barbarossa . 
  ussr probably rolls over germany if given another year . 
  germany and france would be silly to cut the uk out of defense deals/ties . 
  especially fifth generation fighter development . 
  they would have failed horribly . 
  statistics are n't ignorant . 
  fuck this guy sooooooo much . 
  india 's tfr for how big their population is still insanely large . 
  they wo n't , because they do n't want to open the floodgates of refugees . 
  french language is so aesthetically pleasing to listen to . 
  well they should have more babies then . 
  but truthly it 's not linked to globalization or something . 
  their cultural norms and work culture is just bad for family planning . 
  tbf that was polish territory that czechs took while poland was fighting the ussr . 
  south korea and japan are two hyper globalized societies yet they have like 0 immigration . 
  bush is an idiot . 
  from a good point to a terrible point . 
  https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2015/07/17/half-of-worlds-muslims-are-inbred-due-to-generations-of-incest/ http://www.westernfreepress.com/2013/06/13/disturbing-inbreeding-is-a-huge-problem-in-the-muslim-world/ https://wikiislam.net/wiki/cousin_marriage_in_islam  a bbc investigation in britain several years ago revealed that at least 55 % of the pakistani community in britain was married to a first cousin . 
  the times of india affirmed that `` this is thought to be linked to the probability that a british pakistani family is at least 13 times more likely than the general population to have children with recessive genetic disorders . '', 
  i agree , i never understood why globalization is often linked with immigration . 
  yes it 's one of the problems with high immigration and strong welfare state . 
  like 50 % of them are inbred . 
  and a good chunk of them inbred in the uk . 
  edit : actually closer to 70 % i underestimated it . 
  50 % is for the general muslim population . 
  really ? 
  is the 2nd carrier going to have steam catapult ? 
  france wo n't have any stvol aircraft . 
  yeesh , pakistan numbers are worrying . 
  nah dun worry , people are giving you way too much shit lol . 
  agreed , but lowering it this year just to raise it by double the cuts next year is clearly arbitrary . 
  heh , the military hates iran . 
   look at the us . 
  they invest a lot of money into the military while almost completely ignoring healthcare . 
   spending more does n't necessarily mean more or better services . 
  this is the red herring . 
  i already said the system sucks . 
   also , when was the last time the us actually won a war ? 
  from what i know irak was a big bust and so was vietnam . 
  and in both cases nobody asked the us to get involved . 
  lol , please do not compare guerrilla warfare insurgencies where the militants hide in civilian clothing to a proper war . 
  and to answer your question . 
  gulf war . 
   you can actually argue that the uss involvement in wars in the middle east is what led to modern terrorism and the creation of isis . 
  the iranian revolution from the 70s , that led to the creation of islamist extremist states , was sponsored and supported by the us . 
  okay and the relevance of this is ? 
  i never said it was n't on topic , all i said was we do not ignore healthcare . 
  we spend the most per capita . 
  he could have made that point without making a false statement about the usa health care expenditure . 
  the reason our healthcare sucks is because the system sucks . 
  money wise it 's mostly fine . 
  those numbers include pensions for the vets , which the standard accounting for most countries do not include . 
   you can make things running way more efficiently without spending more , providing more budget to the army read this . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/politicaldiscussion/comments/5wopim/does_the_united_states_actually_spend_too_much_on/debzcbx/ waste and efficiencies are n't as easy to cut as people think . 
  sorry i did n't mean you did n't think or was unaware . 
  i just used that as a general phrase . 
  u replied to the wrong guy i think . 
   look at the us . 
  they invest a lot of money into the military while almost completely ignoring healthcare . 
  sigh ... more repeated nonsense about the us healthcare system . 
  the usa spends more per capita on healthcare than anywhere else in the world . 
  the system sucks , but the money is there . 
  beyond that the big scary mic military budget is often a repeated red herring . 
  the budget seems massive because the economy is massive . 
  3.2 % of gdp on the military is not unreasonable considering the usa is designed to fight 2 wars on 3 fronts and win them both . 
  well # 1 like most countries is logistics specifically transport capability . 
  transport operations in mali were heavily assisted by uk and usa , and while normally i would n't think twice , france prides itself on independence from the usa so if they needed help , it 's because they had no other choice . 
  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-aiding-frances-military-operation-in-mali/ most of this is because of the delays in the a400m series . 
  here is a pretty good analysis of most nato nations . 
  scroll down for france . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/credibledefense/comments/5yemzw/question_how_should_nato_countries_invest_their/dev07nc/ on the helicopter issue , that 's another problem with eu military projects . 
  nh90 has been an absolute clusterfuck, 
  sure . 
  the cuts are an attempt to reach the 3 % debt gdp thing so he can retain credibility when pushing for eu reform . 
  edit : i 'm mostly joking guys . 
  i know it will eventually happen . 
   `` i 'm not going to let him f -- me . '',
