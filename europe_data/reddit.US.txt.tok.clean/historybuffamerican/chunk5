  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-migrants-bangladesh-libya-italy-numbers-smuggling-dhaka-dubai-turkey-detained-a7713911.html once again ignoring the fact that there was no refugee crisis until europe decided to blow libya up . 
  also if we want to play the blame each other for who fucked up the middle east more , 99 % of me problems originate from the uk and france playing colonial games at the treaty of versailles . 
  i 'm really not sure i understand your point here . 
  it 's not like the point of the us invasion of iraq was to cause a refugee crisis . 
  it was a mistake . 
  but iraq being a mistake and the refugee policy being a mistake are two separate unrelated issues . 
   oh and sarkozy is a conservative , and he was the french president during the libyan war . 
  and tony blair is labour and he pushed for the iraq war . 
  i 'm not quite sure this finger pointing is useful . 
  ok great , i 've met a muslim and a refugee before . 
  plenty of them really in the usa . 
  glad my points are now relevant . 
   how can conservatives be right about islam when they want the exact same thing . 
  so because conservatives in the usa want one thing , we can apply a blanket statement for conservatives in europe ? 
  or across the world ? 
  edit : also the same exact thing ? 
  a little bit hyperbolic do n't you think ?

  nah , i just do n't really feel the need to discuss american politics on / r/europe . 
  is that relevant ? 
  refugee crisis only occurred after france blew up libya and the syrian civil war started . 
  also , i do find it funny how most comments are talking about the usa or personal questions . 
  what 's the usa got to do with this ? 
  we 're on / r/europe . 
  edit : do people understand what hypocrisy means ? 
  me having a us flair and having an opinion on islam and refugees is n't hypocrisy because the us invaded iraq or the republican party is crazy right now . 
  this is the equivalent of me calling a french poster a hypocrite if he questioned the competence of the us military because france surrendered in ww2 . 
  conservatives were and are right about islam/refugees . 
  edit : ya 'll ca n't construct a single damn argument . 
  2 arguments about the usa , which is funny because this sub blasts russia for whataboutism . 
  another is asking if i 've ever talked to a refugee like that 's relevant or not . 
  it is curious though , do you need more than the s-400 ? 
  napoleon and caesar to gamelin and mussolini . 
  that 's barely post recession too . 
  wait really ? 
  that 's hilarious . 
  i 'm assuming this jet engine is for the pakfa ? 
  turkey seems pretty ambitious with their military programs . 
  this is like comparing relative percentages in absolute values . 
  makes no sense . 
  lol first word i see . 
  i guess i know where this is going . 
  the navy did . 
  why ca n't he just have a normal handshake . 
  your putin replacement ladies and gentleman . 
  i generally believe germans practice realpoltik . 
  i do n't see why they would continue to inquire if they just flat out are n't evening considering a purchase . 
  we 'll see what happens after the german elections . 
  well it 's a maybe . 
  well if i knew the answer it would n't be next generation tank , it would be current generation tank . 
   railguns self destroy with a few hundred shots . 
  well it 's only first generation railgun . 
  navy is aiming for 1000 shots barrel by 2020 . 
  much faster than you think . 
  http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/military/bae-wants-to-equip-armys-future-tanks-with-railguns https://www.defensetech.org/2014/10/23/bae-proposes-rail-guns-for-armys-future-fighting-vehicle/ like i said , next generation tank will have railguns . 
  tanks do n't need a mach 7.5 rail gun . 
  that 's all fine and dandy , but i do n't see the point when the next generation tank will be via railguns . 
  edit : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4_lz8fl-mc you do n't even need that big of a turret . 
  mach 7 is overkill for tanks . 
  naw , way way way too late to be a replacement for the tornado . 
  what the fuck are you on about . 
  just to give people here a rough estimate what sixth gen planes might look like . 
  some pitched ideas . 
  - lasers to shoot down incoming missiles and replace guns for cas and dogfights . 
  massive game changer if you could intercept missiles like that . 
  this will probably be added the f-35 actually . 
  - manned and unmanned . 
  - lockheed has unveiled self repair skins . 
  - there is talk about separating aircraft into a system of aircraft rather than binary multirole . 
  although in general drone swarms are very overrated by the general public . 
  - absolutely no tail - closer to a bomber than a fighter in the traditional sense . 
  -3 d printing replacement parts . 
  - the ability to launch drones from the aircraft . 
  basically the next generation plane will continue what the fifth generation plane does . 
  it 's not so much a fighter , but a weapons system . 
  i just think it 's odd with railguns being on the cusp of relevance .
