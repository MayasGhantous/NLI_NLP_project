  alan turing . 
  imitation game , great movie . 
   `` we have been working on a trade deal which will be a very , very big deal , a very powerful deal , great for both countries and i think we will have that done very , very quickly . '', 
  lol . 
   economy was in the same situation if not worse as in uk citation needed . 
  sigh ... 
   and than there was a new power ( usa ) that made sure that uk lost its colonies and influence over the world . 
  they lost it without the usa . 
  by ww2 canada and australia were independent . 
  3 years later india was independent and usa had nothing to do with it . 
  british empire without india , canada and australia is pretty worthless . 
  financially bankrupt = ca n't maintain empire . 
  france came out of ww2 actually way better than ww1 even though they were occupied . 
  financials were in tact , manpower was intact . 
  only thing lost was reputation and honour but those things are recoverable . 
  uk had to call in its empire twice in a short span which gave colonies excuses for independence . 
   china is however militaristic expansionist and has more people so it might not follow the same pattern . 
  having not enough people was n't japan 's problem it was having an aging population due to low fertility rates . 
  along with a housing/debt bubble . 
  for example . 
  china roughly has 120 boys for 100 girls . 
  product of one child policy . 
  china has a fertility rate of 1.5 and the government efforts to increase births has fallen flat .

  course that 's just one point of view . 
  uk benefits a lot from us soft power . 
  so many british concepts taken in hollywood movies . 
  meh people said the same thing after vietnam . 
  people thought ussr was going to win the cold war . 
  edit : people legitimately thought japan was going to surpass america as well . 
  those damn refugees . 
  how does trudeau do it ? 
  ww1 and ww2 are huge disasters for uk . 
  lmao , +1 for merkel . 
  wait fo real ? 
  because i linked the gripen and meads which is led by germany ? 
  but no , i just take interest in military and history .

   in the u.s.-built f-16 fighter jet lol the f-16 is 40 years old and people still want it . 
  ( india ) life extended to 2048 . 
  it will just keep going and going and going .

  do you have to take a joke so seriously ... 
  usa, 
   btw - we bought some jassm-er ( over 900 km range ) from usa . 
  are f-35 already used to carry them ? 
  ( our f-16s are ) not right now , but the f-35 will carry the jassm-er when the program matures . 
  it 's already planned out . 
  f-35 's will also be new . 
  bra , the usa will offer the f-35 to poland , just a matter of economics now . 
  i 'm hoping he can do a 180 on free trade and climate change and then hey . 
  we 'll have a standardish us president . 
  nothing and i mean nothing can beat the a-10 for sounding badass . 
  given that poland is right next to russia i 'm guessing range is n't there biggest concern . 
  dis thread lmao . 
  doctrine differences . 
  missile defense systems have been the cornerstone of their doctrine since the cold war started . 
  they knew they could n't match the air power of nato so they use deterrence via s-400 to counter . 
  basically everything else went to shit military wise except for the military defense systems . 
  sm-6 can be launched from ground and navy . 
  it performs 3 roles ( can shoot down aircraft , cruise missiles and ships . ), 
  they are different in one 's a system and one 's a missile , but the roles are quite similar . 
  even if they could , they should take it one step further by purchasing the superior sm-6, 
  no one writes their own speeches . 
  that ca n't shoot down missiles can it ? 
  it uses aim-120s which is solely designed for aircraft . 
  is there a european equivalent ? 
  do they use left tilting xxx for other countries or is just because they 're conservative ? 
  this was a lot more direct than i expected . 
  is the investigation over ? 
  did they confirm it was n't a terror attack ? 
  musta missed that . 
  my bad . 
  `` deport refu ... . '' hate speech . 
  if you check my history i 'm actually staunchly against refugees/immigration . 
  it just annoys me when facts are ignored in favour of narratives . 
   it ignored orders from the greek law enforcement , which were forced to respond with force . 
  that 's fine , fire warning shots . 
  not shots that hit the actual boat that might have resulted in deaths ... 
  it 's just like the mosque attack . 
  right wingers do n't care because the attacker was n't muslim/victims were muslim and left wingers do n't care because it was n't a white male alt right conservative . 
  the amount of narrative pushing nowadays disgusts me . 
  fair enough but i really do n't think it 's politically possible for germany to get their own independent nukes . 
  maybe sharing with france instead of usa or something . 
  wtf is wrong with you ? 
  why would you hit the ship with your warning shots . 
  this could have escalated big time if anyone was actually killed . 
   the current us government does n't want to pay for it . 
  sounds like there could be an easy solution that both parties could agree to . 
  what would be the solution ? 
  withdrawing the bomb ? 
  usa paying for the bomb ? 
  i 'm just glad the gmd worked . 
  german soccer . 
  so good . 
  ok there are bad ways to spend money and there are worse ways to spend money . 
  this is the latter . 
  congrats to france and iran !, 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  uk unemployment is reaching what economists call `` maximum employment . '',
