  `` the biggest barrier to european superpowerdom is that european elites refuse to bring their postmodern fantasies about the illegitimacy of military ` hard power ' into line with the way the rest of the world interprets reality '', 
  depends if you ask a frenchman or someone from a eurofighter country . 
  india has mig-21s , mig-27s , mig-29s , su-30s , mirages , jaguars , sea harriers , and indigenous fighters all currently in service . 
  they 're also russia 's partner on the t-50 . 
  and now they 're buying rafales . 
  a lot of them have to be retired soon , but only 36 rafales are n't going to replace all of those fighters . 
  so it looks like the grab bag of different fighters will continue . 
  who the fuck is ok with nk having nukes ? 
   on 5 september 1972 , at 10:25 , [ 10 ] icgv \u00c6gir , under gu\u00f0mundur kj\u00e6rnested 's command , encountered an unmarked trawler fishing northeast of hornbanki . 
  the master of this black-hulled trawler refused to divulge the trawler 's name and number , and , after being warned to follow the coast guard 's orders , played rule , britannia !, 
  over the radio lol, 
  those things happened in almost every country in the 20th century . 
  your dream union would be the world 's largest producer of smug . 
  the only reason france is `` superior '' is because we did n't give you to stalin at yalta . 
  not in boston, 
   benign 1970s soviet union i think the czechs , slovaks , afghans , chinese , and [ soviet theists ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ussr_anti-religious_campaign_%281970s%e2%80%9387%29 ) might disagree about how benign they were in that period . 
  having american family or being american does n't preclude you from hating america . 
  lots of american leftists circlejerk about how awful amerikkka is . 
   i have a reputation ? 
  sweet !, 
  interestingly , the easiest way to identify is a communist is to look out for hardcore anti-americans . 
  commies will argue with each other for days over the details of their ideology , but one thing they all agree on is that america is the devil . 
  and here come the butthurt communists of / r/europe . 
  / u/residentdirtbag and / u/anarchisto are already at it , all we need is / u/zyllber . 
   i doubt we will hear an official apollogy from the us within my lifetime . 
  [ is 2009 not within your lifetime , dickhead ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/native_american_apology_resolution ), 
  that was just the first result when i googled . 
  regardless of the specific number , a huge number of women and girls from moldova find their way into prostitution . 
  there are a million sources for more info . 
  human trafficking is a massive problem in moldova . 
  [ 70 percent of moldovan women aged 15-25 had prostituted themselves at least once . 
  ] ( http://www.croatiantimes.com/news/around_the_world/2012-01-31/24787/two_thirds_of_moldovan_young_women_in_prostitution ), 
  they 're still mad about all the tea we dumped in the ocean, 
  macedonia is no less relevant than half the countries of europe . 
  including yours . 
  because as soon as they have them everyone else in the region will want them . 
  saudi arabia has already said exactly that . 
  you really do n't think a bunch of nukes all over the middle east is a terrible fucking idea ? 
  also , they 're a terrorist state . 
  do you know how much money they 've given to organizations like hamas and hezbelloh ? 
  first of all , canada did host us nukes until the 80s . 
  second , how is hosting nukes coming close to nuclear war ? 
  belgium , germany , italy , and the netherlands are all hosting american nukes . 
  are they close to nuclear war ? 
  and 90 % of your population is right along the us border . 
  if there is a nuclear exchange , canada is fucked no matter what . 
  i wonder if the f-35 or typhoon could be made to carry [ france 's air-launched cruise missile ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air-sol_moyenne_port%c3%a9e ) . 
  its already a mature technology so there 's no need to sink piles of money into development . 
  if the ssbns/tridents get cut , does that mean there 's no political will for nuclear weapons at all ? 
  for anyone who does n't know , this is the uk 's only platform for launching nuclear missiles . 
  without this , they 're no longer a nuclear power . 
  i like the idea of at least one other western country having this capability . 
  it adds a little extra assured-ness to mutually assured destruction . 
  even if someone miraculously manages to cripple america 's second strike ability , the brits and frenchies still have our back . 
  all 3 of us having ssbns at sea makes a nuclear strike on the west absolutely unthinkable . 
  there 's no way you can disable all 3 countries ' ability to make a retaliatory strike . 
  also , having a strong network of allies is a big advantage for us ( all of us ) over china ( and russia ) . 
  if euros keep cutting their military capabilities , you 're not so strong any more . 
  europe is also losing ground almost daily to the rest of the world economically . 
  no need to cede ground militarily too and rush into irrelevance . 
  he 's probably better off in europe . 
  that 322 pounds for those who prefer freedom units . 
   well , there 's this chick [ 1 ] kicking ass everywhere she goes . 
  its cool you have an athlete kicking ass , but holy shit is she ugly . 
  everyone always points this out , but people almost never object to castilian being called spanish despite there being multiple languages in spain . 
  i think its generally understood that people are referring to mandarin when they reference `` chinese '' . 
  can most dutchies do the th sound ? 
   any neurologist interested in linguistics will tell you that the use of different languages heavily influences our thinking patterns . 
  actually that 's been thoroughly discredited, 
  if he 's accomplished so much , why so much butthurt over republicans not voting for his initiatives ? 
  democrats and republicans hating each other is n't a new phenomenon . 
  skilled politicians find common ground and ways to offer opponents something they want to vote for . 
  like clinton with welfare reform or bush with education reform . 
  dear obama , thank you for being too incompetent to pass most of your agenda . 
  sincerely , hlpe, 
  i was n't a fan of him either . 
  not only do they still have a space program , but we launch their spacecraft for them since they do n't have the capabilities . 
  i do n't know why we 'd do that if we did n't want them to have a space program . 
  also , they maintained ties to cuba throughout the cold war , recognized the prc 9 years before we did , and refused to participate in iraq . 
  obama, 
  100 % 2:05 i would have been faster with a real mouse, 
  you mean kaliningrad island . 
  then their soldiers are probably better than most . 
  i do n't doubt that they have some quite capable special forces . 
  i just doubt that they 're quite as good as the major military powers . 
  i 'm sure the dutch have some very skilled special forces . 
  but i do n't think any small peaceful country can compare to the us , uk , france , russia , and israel due to budgets and combat experience . 
  i mean the dutch have * some * experience as you said , but there 's no way they 're on the same level as mossad or the seals or whatever french sf are called . 
   apparently , it was a personal present and was never donated to a museum or anything . 
  franco may have considered it a personal gift , but i do n't think that was the intent . 
  the inscription even said `` presented to the people of ... '', 
  who were they supposed to give it to ? 
  maybe a side effect of being in a region with many small/medium countries in close proximity ? 
  i assumed ambassadors were kind of outdated in the modern age since everyone can just call each other 's foreign ministry if there 's an issue . 
  but i guess they still have a role to play . 
  i guess being a good fundraiser and a good ambassador are n't mutually exclusive . 
   american ambassadors behave like governors placed to rule foreign colonies . 
  most us ambassadors are people who donated a lot of money to the president 's campaign and are rewarded with an easy , cushy job . 
  it looks like bulgaria usually gets a legitimate diplomat , but a lot of countries do n't .
