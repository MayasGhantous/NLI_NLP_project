  but they also have large numbers of well-trained and very capable soldiers . 
  and numbers matter too . 
  russia has more soldiers than uk , france , and germany combined . 
   if its about military technology nearly 70 % of russian armed forces are using soviet era equipment guess what the leopard ii is ? 
  and the m1 abrams , and f-15s and f-16s , and tornados , europe 's only aircraft carrier , all of your small arms , almost all of your artillery , etc etc. 
  cold war era gear works just fine . 
  even the us with our massive spending still has a fuck-ton of cold war equipment that works great . 
  and russia has introduced lots of state of the art stuff very recently . 
   their lack of precision missiles ? 
  russia easily has better missile tech than europe . 
  way better actually . 
   their lax use of uavs ? 
  and europe is better renting theirs from the us ? 
   and the f-22 is the single best fighter on the planet only 1 country has f-22s and its not in europe . 
  europe 's strength is on paper . 
  all the fighter jets in the world wo n't help you if you lack sufficient spare parts and ordnance for them ( and you do ) . 
   against russia , the uk france and germany would be more than enough that 's not true . 
  do 5 minutes researching military capabilities . 
  budget figures are not a good proxy . 
  we have the same naive idealists . 
  they just do n't have any power here , and half the country hates them . 
  you see them all over reddit claiming all the world 's ills are because of american interventionism . 
  they want us to be like europe and slash our military budget and spend it all on welfare . 
  not that our foreign policy has n't been full of blunders , because it has been , but its at least conceived of with pragmatism in mind . 
  peace comes from strength . 
  starry-eyed idealism has no place in international relations or foreign affairs . 
   he was instrumental in stopping us/saudi arabia move into syria . 
  us public opinion stopped that . 
   congress is too rightwing for europe i do n't think euros give a shit about congress . 
   i agree with our war on isis , because it was a result of the iraq war . 
  but we need to gtfo of any other conflict . 
  isis came out of syria , not iraq . 
  you 're entire post was really silly . 
   the west has repeatedly been under estimated by pretty much everyone that has declared war on/invaded/bullied it , and the west has come out on top every single time . 
  europe has changed . 
  no offense , but you 're a bunch of pussies now . 
  there 's more than enough us presence in europe to give russian propaganda enough material to work with . 
  i bet most of your fap folder is american porn, 
   well , it depends what you think the kremlin 's goals are . 
  i think they want to divide europe , not unite it . 
  they should be continuing to do things like buying off greece and hungary . 
  sabre-rattling with bombers will unite people against a common foe . 
   europe re-militarising would only be a bad thing for them if they thought they could actually properly invade . 
  no one ever wants their rivals to militarize . 
   whereas , if their actual aim is to create an external threat to keep the russian population supporting the government , then a  80 % putin approval rating suggests their plan is working so far . 
  usa is the greatest boogeyman ever . 
  i do n't think they need europe to convince the population there 's a threat . 
  i think this is dumb on russia 's part . 
  before all this europe was extremely complacent militarily . 
  its like they 're going out of their way to remind everyone to take defense seriously . 
  they 're also strengthening america 's position in europe by reminding everyone how important we are . 
  throngs of europeans cheering a us military convoy would have been a ludicrous idea a few years go . 
   the walloon feel really proud of not being french . 
  does n't everyone ? 
  i guess we 'll have to find a new sidekick . 
   in the pacific it took over two years for the us with all its massive industrial capacity to even have a navy capable of winning a single battle . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_midway we beat japan in a major battle 6 months after our pacific fleet was crippled at pearl harbor . 
  do n't forget my favorite , mountain jews, 
  do n't feel bad . 
  ljubljana is a lovely city . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ know . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding . 
  i agree . 
  europeans can still make good stuff even if they are n't pioneering bleeding edge military tech . 
   perhaps the independance/sovereignty thing for the defence is more of a french thing and that the rest of europe is happy to rely on the us in military , diplomacy and industry . 
  british and french i 'd say . 
  poland is getting serious too . 
  they could be reasonably strong militarily . 
  they just need the domestic industry so they do n't need to import everything . 
  i live in the 5th largest city in the country , 50 miles from the coast . 
  you 're retarded if you think that 's `` flyover '', 
   it would be like a real life rendition of a cripple fight . 
  any war between peers could be fierce . 
  men slaughtered each other for thousands of years with spears and armies the size of a modern division . 
  til pennsylvania is a flyover state, 
  as long as the bay area goes too, 
  the german army * is * strong . 
  they 've even been [ training thai soldiers ] ( http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/980w/public/2014/06/07/thailand_politics_aw102_43315883.jpg?itok=g5pz2ogo ) and preparing a [ home guard ] ( http://withtheresistance.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/broom-army.jpg ) . 
  invading armies have n't been able to cross the english channel in 1,000 years . 
  good luck with the atlantic ocean . 
  the internet is insufferable today, 
  as much as i 'd like to get rid of california , this is n't the way to do it . 
   we 're not that bad in aeronotics . 
  we have the skills and the technology . 
  the americans might have some advance in drones , but it 's not a definitive truth written in stone . 
  i think that as long as america spends a lot more money and obtains substantially more combat experience , we 'll always be ahead . 
  for just one example , look at stealth tech . 
  to this day no one but the us has fielded stealth aircraft . 
  russia is just recently getting into pre-production mode in 2015 . 
  the us has been working on it since the 70s . 
  [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/f-117_nighthawk_front.jpg ) was combat-ready by 1983 . 
  we 've designed several more stealth aircraft since , and have accumulated thousands of combat sorties with them and hundreds of thousands of non-combat flight hours . 
  that experience gives american engineers a major advantage . 
  and there 's also the fact that our r&d budget is bigger than most european countries ' entire defense budget . 
  you just said something somewhat positive about the us . 
  i feel like i should take a screenshot . 
   greece would make a complete turn to russia . 
  that would be one of the dumbest things any country has ever done . 
   some us states have extra restrictions for parties that are n't the republicans or democrats that are insane . 
  like what ?
