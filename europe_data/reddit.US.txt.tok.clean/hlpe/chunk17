  [ yeah , those years sure were `` sweet '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_terror ) nothing says progressive like executions , deportations , labor camps , state monopoly on media , and persecuting religious groups . 
  also so everyone can hear the star spangled banner 1,000 times every olympics . 
  arguing with you is a waste of time . 
  you 'll obviously go through whatever mental gymnastics necessary . 
  just remember how `` soft and timid '' the us is the next time you 're calling us warmongers . 
   making sure to only send non-lethal aid seems pretty timid to me . 
  radars , humvees , and drones are better than strongly worded letters , which is all europe has to offer . 
   yes , parading within the absolute safety of nato borders helps ukraine so much . 
  that was n't about helping ukraine , it was about assuring eastern european nato members because they have more faith in us than they do in their european partners  by `` some eu countries '' you mean greece , right ? 
  [ slovakian pm : western sanctions on russia are not in the interests of slovakia and czech republic ] ( http://www.sott.net/article/293823-slovakian-pm-western-sanctions-on-russia-are-not-in-the-interests-of-slovakia-and-czech-republic ) [ greece pulls support from russian sanctions ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-31/greece-pulls-support-from-russian-sanctions-tsipras-tells-tass ) [ hungary pm orban condemns eu sanctions on russia ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28801353 ) [ eu should lift anti-russia sanctions - italian foreign minister ] ( http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150331/1020240855.html )  please do n't pretend like the geographical location of a conflict matters one bit . 
  it 's a small planet , it 's your backyard too , and it is your geopolitical arch-rival . 
  russia is not our `` arch-rival '' . 
  you insult china with such rhetoric . 
  russia 's economy and military are pathetic compared to ours and they do n't even have global ambitions . 
  they just want to control their `` near abroad '' . 
  and its retarded to claim the geography does n't matter and russia is threatening the us as much as they are europe . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  we 've given the ukrainian army drones , radar , communications gear , humvees , trainers and advisers . 
  we held off on giving them lethal aid largely due to pleas from germany and france . 
  we 've also been waving our dick in russia 's face by parading our military through eastern europe and sending a carrier battle group into the mediterranean . 
  and unlike some eu countries , we have n't wavered in our commitment to sanctions . 
  all this because of a threat in *** your *** back yard . 
   so looks like it 's just the usa and north korea that wo n't be getting an invite then they 'd be thrilled to have the us on board . 
   maybe i 'm just not happy with they way my government is acting , huh ? 
  there 's nothing they could do to stop your incessant bitching . 
  i 'm assuming greece accounts for a rather small percent of russia 's gas exports . 
  they might be willing to take the hit if they think it will promote discord within the eu . 
   what else will come from america ? 
  gun rights . 
  you have a raging hate boner for the us . 
  every damn thread i see you in . 
  when was the last time a us president condoned racism ? 
  so if the eu countries left nato to reduce dependence on the us , and russia launched a hybrid invasion of estonia , you think the rest of europe would be prepared to fight the russians off ? 
  i think their intervention would be limited to sanctions and strongly worded letters . 
  would more equipment really increase the confidence of eastern europeans that you 'd actually use it to defend them ? 
  not when they 're done with the aircraft carriers in progress, 
  vermont and michigan are n't recognized by the czech republic, 
  most of reddit is stuck in that second phase . 
  and not just with regards to america but religion and other things as well . 
  i can deny it because you are wrong . 
  http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/ of the 9 latin american countries surveyed by pew , the us has a 60 % or higher approval rating in 8 of them . 
  and the 9th is designated as a major non-nato ally . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was eu expansion that triggered the turmoil in ukraine , not nato . 
  he referenced things my country did decades ago . 
  i did the same about his . 
  there was nothing personal about it . 
  i just think there 's a double standard . 
  people constantly shit on the us for things done during the cold war , but if someone mentions something the germans did in ww2 you get called out as an asshole . 
  the 1945 statute of limitations is awfully convenient for america-bashers . 
  and what horrendous things does america do on a daily basis ? 
  [ i 'm not sure what you expected them to do at the time ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/allied_army_positions_on_10_may_1945.png/450px-allied_army_positions_on_10_may_1945.png ) . 
  do you really want to talk about crimes committed by [ previous generations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria_in_the_time_of_national_socialism ) ? 
  or is that only valid when criticizing the us ? 
  that 's only a few leftist countries . 
  most south american countries have stronger relations with the us than russia . 
  we actually have [ defensive alliance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inter-american_treaty_of_reciprocal_assistance ) with most of them . 
  and now you 're both practically american satellites . 
  as africa becomes more educated and prosperous they will start learning english just like every other country has as they 've developed . 
  these results do n't match up with my experience in various countries either . 
  i wonder how large and representative the samples were . 
  then they 'd be fighting for american values . 
  we actually have a [ world cup-style tournament ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_baseball_classic ) for baseball every 4 years . 
  they have a rule that allows players to represent the country their parents come from , which european countries use to stack their teams with americans . 
  except the dutch who use players from the caribbean territories . 
  it [ draws higher tv ratings in japan than the olympics ] ( http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/08/sports/la-sp-sn-japan-world-baseball-classic-20130308 ) . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  seriously , what do you know about the sport of baseball or how its organized ? 
  we have `` only '' 187 f-22s , so keeping the f-15s around makes sense . 
  they 'll serve another 10 years at least , though their numbers are being cut very gradually . 
  i thought you nordics were all homogay for each other . 
  do n't they also have their own orthodox-catholic hybrid church ? 
  more than a third of major league players are from other countries . 
  whoever wins is legitimately the best team in the world . 
  the f-15 has over 100 air-to-air combat kills without a single loss . 
  well , it is the german navy we 're talking about . 
  the fishermen probably had a fighting chance . 
   but we have n't really seen this change to warfare demonstrated yet on a large scale between two countries with up-to-date weapons , thankfully . 
  there 's only one country capable of large-scale naval warfare , so its really not possible . 
  canada is actually at the very bottom , 1 % . 
  so the german navy fired 3 rounds ... what are they going to do now that they used all their ammunition ? 
  do they have to wait until the 2016 budget kicks in to get more ? 
  thank you for understanding that . 
  please teach everyone else on reddit . 
  in a world with journalists rotting in prison , children forced into armies , people being beheaded for their religion , etc it just seems silly to set aside one subset of human rights like that . 
  * tougher * blasphemy laws ? 
  you already have blasphemy laws ? 
  that 's britain . 
  believe it or not , saudi arabia 's government is actually more progressive than much of their population . 
  if they gave women equal rights , they 'd have violent unrest in the streets . 
  they could probably improve things here and there , but i do n't think sweeping reforms are feasible . 
  and the west pretty much has to support them . 
  any alternative government would likely be even worse . 
  a power vacuum would be an unimaginable nightmare . 
  various jihadists fighting for control of mecca would be worse than isis . 
  the current government is stable and at least somewhat willing to work with the west . 
  that 's a low bar , but it actually makes them better than most regimes in the region . 
  so they really ca n't reform significantly , and we ca n't stop supporting them . 
  so whats the point ? 
  its pissing in the wind . 
  like i said , it would be better to support ngos on the ground and education initiatives and such .
