   and because i do n't think the usa would like it . 
  stop blaming everything on us . 
  no one gives a shit about irish drug laws . 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( https://themiseryguts.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/shee-shagger.jpg ), 
  i do n't think germany 's poor state of readiness and lack of equipment is their biggest problem . 
  they could have a million tanks and fighter jets and all the spare parts in the world . 
  other countries would still assume that they are extremely averse to any fighting and will do anything to avoid it . 
   military spending is at last mostly just the governement paying earnings to its citizens . 
  its maikes up most of the cost less so for smaller countries . 
  germany can design and build things like leopard tanks domestically , but greece has to import their high price equipment . 
  england 's world cup entry - we know we wo n't win so we have n't really bothered, 
   i love how the us is becoming increasingly leftist do n't let reddit fool you . 
  the right wing party in america has their largest majority in congress since 1928 . 
  also they control more state governments than they have since 1928 . 
  [ and here we see a german soldier showing a frenchman how the primary weapon of the bundeswehr works ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/fp/projects/nucwcost/broom.jpg ), 
  you 're right that everyone is spying on each other . 
  but you 're delusional if you think eu countries are as capable as the americans in that department . 
  the us budget for intelligence is [ more than 50 billion dollars per year ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_intelligence_budget ) . 
  that 's more than germany 's entire defense budget . 
  ten times the esa 's budget . 
  twice estonia 's entire gdp . 
   but an occupied western country would be one pissed-off insurgency . 
  i think that would vary by country . 
  i have a lot more capable guns than glocks . 
  and gun owners in my state alone outnumber the entire russian army 6 to 1 . 
  and since they ca n't devote their entire army to pennsylvania , we 'll have them outnumbered more like 200 to 1 . 
   i assume this means they wo n't host the world cup ? 
  if the world cup gets cancelled , the english team will be 0-0 . 
  which would be one of the better results in recent times . 
  slap a scotsman for trying to get rid of the nukes . 
  eh , it could be seen as a bit nitpicky . 
  i think its fine to refer to the family of rifles as ak47s in colloquial speech . 
  the floors of german barracks are probably spotless, 
  finns are definitely the coolest nordics . 
  the rest are a bunch of damn hippies . 
  during the cold war , nato 's plan for norway in a possible soviet invasion of w europe was to just abandon it because they did n't expect the norwegians to put up any resistance . 
  denmark surrendered to the nazis in 6 hours . 
  sweden refused to fight and sold the nazis iron ore to build planes and tanks . 
  finns on the other hand gave everyone a rifle and slaughtered commies in massive numbers . 
  ak-pattern rifles are still ubiquitous in the russian military and will be for quite some time to come . 
  the brand new variant is the [ ak-12 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ak-12 ), 
  do n't feel bad , op . 
  the us is the greatest superpower in the world and western europeans are even smug towards us . 
  its not about bulgaria , its about the way they are . 
  [ russians are n't allowed to buy your `` services '' ] ( http://www.discountshop.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/3019025262_edb9d64897_z.jpg ), 
  [ bundeswehr central arms depot ] ( http://thehpalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/broomsticks.png ), 
  their economies are not comparable in the slightest . 
  over 40 % of kuwait 's gdp is oil exports . 
  all that money goes straight into government coffers . 
  baltic countries have to raise money with taxes . 
  i 'd say `` yay second amendment ! '', 
  then i 'd start shooting russians . 
  the guys in my neighborhood are better armed than the bundeswehr . 
  they use an updated version of it . 
  kuwait has a huge state owned oil industry that basically pumps money out of the ground . 
   the combined population of the baltic states is around 6m , with an economy of $ 171b , 1.5 % of 171b is still only 2.5 b. 
  that 's one-fourth of poland 's defense spending , and the poles are still using migs they bought in the warsaw pact days ( though they also have some upgraded f-16s ) . 
  i think they 're better off investing that money in sams , anti-tank weapons , good c3 tech , and lots of training . 
  a single eurofighter or f-35 costs around 100 million dollars . 
  in 2009 , germany paid 89 million euros per typhoon . 
  the last lot of f-35s were between $ 98mm and $ 116mm depending on configuration . 
  if lithuania devoted every penny of their military budget to buying eurofighters for a year , they could afford five . 
  and that leaves no money for fuel , maintenance , or salary for a pilot . 
  if they decided they wanted a navy instead of an air force , their annual budget would pay for 8.3 % of a queen elizabeth-class carrier . 
  a country of 3 million people is n't going to be able to buy that shit unless they 're sitting on top of a fuckton of oil . 
  [ nato helps the baltic states with policing their airspace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_air_policing ) . 
  other members take turns deploying jets to their area . 
  right now its belgium , poland , italy , and spain . 
  soon they 'll rotate and other countries will take a turn . 
  the host countries kick in a couple million euros to cover costs . 
  the us also sends some jets to their area in times of heightened tensions ( like now ) . 
  [ we founded our country by kicking the euros out ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/surrender_of_lord_cornwallis.jpg ), 
  their cities are gone because of genocidal maniacs from europe . 
  [ this one in colorado is pretty cool ] ( https://drdjjc.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/16-oct-cliff-palace-mesa-verde-1-of-1.jpg ) . 
  there 's also [ cahokia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cahokia ) whose population at its peak in the 1200s would not be surpassed by any city in the united states until the late 18th century . 
  of course there were also great empires in central and south murica . 
  [ you just photoshopped the head of some finn no one 's ever heard of on ronald reagan ] ( http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/183/0/6/ronald_reagan_riding_a_velociraptor_by_sharpwriter-d55rsh7.jpg ), 
  native muricans were founding peaceful settlements when europeans were still burning jews for causing the plague . 
  your downloads of hollywood movies and brazzers porno has nothing to do with the war in iraq . 
  mostly , yes . 
  your right to steal american media ? 
  russian propagandists are going to have a field day with this, 
  and if we had been a british colony in living memory people would refer to us as a former british colony . 
  but it was a couple centuries ago . 
  `` former british colony of america '' or `` former nazi state of france '' are simply not comparable to the `` former soviet republic of latvia '' . 
  i 'm not talking shit . 
  i like the baltic countries . 
  when i get a chance to visit europe , i want to go the the west slavic and baltic countries . 
  i have little interest in visiting western europe . 
  but complaining about how you 're referred to in news articles is n't going to get you anywhere . 
  its how you 're known . 
  continue to develop and improve your country and you 'll make it known for other things . 
  a lot of people in the us already know about lithuania because of their basketball accomplishments . 
  a us news article will be a lot less likely to to refer to lithuania as `` the former ... '' because arvydas sabonis and zydrunas ilgauskas helped build a lithuanian identity abroad . 
  your country in its modern incarnation is 25 years old and you had to spend a lot of that time rebuilding . 
  you have n't yet built up a strong identity in the eyes of people far away . 
  make your companies successful , win some medals , invent something , build a famous tourist hotspot , send athletes to impress in foreign sports leagues , etc. 
  then people will just know you as just latvia . 
  if france had been occupied for most of a lifetime instead of 3.5 years .
