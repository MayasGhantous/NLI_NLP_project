  too bad they 're hopelessly corrupt and would sell much of what we give them on the black market . 
  you 're an esl speaker what the hell do you know ? 
  they probably confused you with slovenia . 
  if my aunt had balls she 'd be my uncle . 
  the ez has a lot of problems to solve . 
  its not like they 're on the verge of matching the usd . 
  there 's a lot of work to be done . 
  and if it was easy they would have done it already . 
   getting closer and closer to the usd . 
  no its not . 
  the usd has never been more secure as top dog . 
  the euro has become less of a rival to the usd thanks to the tumult of the last few years . 
  it 's hard to think of a less relevant country ireland ? 
  says the guy from denmark . 
  my state is more relevant than your country . 
  and racking up massive death totals . 
  still dwarfs esa 's budget . 
  so bumfuckistan should have equal say to the us in the un ? 
  have you ever gotten a handy from a street worker ? 
  they 're just doing what they can . 
  they do good things , believe it or not . 
  i have a good friend from timor leste . 
  if not for the un , her country would still be under foreign occupation . 
  the world food program is undoubtedly a good thing . 
  they 've mediated many important treaties like the law of the seas . 
  like any huge bureaucracy , it has tons of flaws and inefficiencies that should be reformed . 
  but it definitely has an important place in the world . 
  wars have n't come and gone as usual . 
  powerful developed countries stopped fighting each other in the 1940s . 
  you can debate how much the un has to do with that , but they clearly have n't failed . 
  they will never be able to be anything like a world police . 
  if they told the us to do something , we would laugh in their faces . 
  same with china or any other sufficiently powerful country . 
  does that mean they should never do anything ? 
  they have a role to play . 
  but powerful world police is n't that role . 
  the most pro-us country in the world . 
  that does n't mean we automatically vote together on every un resolution . 
  most of which no one really cares about . 
  it was never supposed to be some kind of world police . 
  it was meant as a forum for communication , to prevent great powers from going to war against each other . 
  its worked . 
   well , other people here on / r/europe [ 1 ] always goes on about how bad greek finances have historically always been , how poor the governance . 
  hindsight makes everyone a genius investor, 
  not even them .

   plus russia is bankrupt its definitely not . 
  on reddit the hate usually comes from the fact that texas is politically conservative . 
  britain, 
   do n't understand that one . 
  aside from small-scale stuff like a specops raid or littoral operations , the dutch military can not wage war on its own . 
  its not designed to . 
  its structured to compliment the forces of larger allies in a coalition . 
  worked out well for you a few times . 
  if americans cured cancer and gave the cure to every patient on earth for free , a significant number of posters here would find a way to take jabs at the us over it . 
  the dutch have a defense minister and a chief of defense . 
  and the dutch military is designed to be a junior partner in coalitions . 
  that 's not the model you 'd want a pan-eu military to follow . 
  it requires someone in charge of the military, 
  i get what you 're saying . 
  but in a crisis , military decisions must be swift and decisive . 
  there has to be a cic , and not one who needs approval to wipe his ass . 
  they are political ideologues more than economists . 
  especially krugman . 
  reddit in a nutshell, 
  whatever . 
  its still retarded to say `` usa ( imf ) '' when we have less than 20 % of the vote . 
  yes . 
  not 100 % , but to a very significant degree . 
  https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/members.aspx the us has 16.74 % of the vote . 
  the eu has more votes than the us does . 
  the imf is hardly a us puppet . 
  i do n't know where this idea came from . 
   proof does n't build rockets , but it does change people 's minds , and when enough people 's minds are changed then action can happen does n't anyone need their minds changed about nk at this point ? 
  i think its universally accepted what kind of place it is . 
   there are almost no christians in europe anymore . 
  there are many millions of christians in europe . 
   even in poland , the most religious christian country in europe , only 40 % attend church . 
  that 's 15 million people . 
   stop whining about nato requirements or low public opinions of the us . 
  i 've never met anyone who gave a shit about europeans ' opinion of the us . 
  we do n't care . 
  how is that relevant ? 
  $ 14 million is n't cheap regardless of what a fighter costs . 
  are mercedes cheap because ferraris cost more ? 
   drones are n't expensive yes they are . 
  an mq-9 reaper costs $ 14 million . 
  ukraine does n't have a lot of money . 
   the ukrainians are getting no military aid because their military ca n't fight for shit and they 'd lose the drones in 5min to russian special forces . 
  its because corrupt officers will sell them on the black market . 
  and there 's no reasonable amount of aid we can give them that will allow them to beat the world 's # 2 military . 
  and because no one wants to escalate . 
  there are a million reasons . 
   the fact that conservatives pretend that he 's a radical communist calling for the proletariat to seize the means of production does n't really change this . 
  republicans do n't say any of that . 
  they ignore him because he 's a non-factor . 
  they ca n't afford a license for ms office . 
  they had to type it up in notepad . 
  the world at that point lacked a hegemon with massive superiority over everyone else . 
  the world also lacked nukes .
