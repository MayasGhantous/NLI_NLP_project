  obviously there are many other factors at play , but i feel like people do n't acknowledge that enough . 
  and the english language took off as the world 's dominate language after the collapse of the british empire . 
  uk made it ** a ** major global language . 
  usa made it ** the ** major global language . 
  when britain was at its peak , french was the lingua franca . 
  the global explosion of english in recent generations is overwhelmingly due to the usa . 
  hollywood and silicon valley have spread english further in the last 50 years than england has . 
  that 's ableist . 
  triggered . 
  and made it the global lingua franca . 
  speaking english causes obesity . 
  and hungarian apparently . 
  their military spending certainly did n't help , but its far from one of their biggest problems . 
   many of those countries are one bad event away from an uprising . 
  with right-wing nationalism growing rapidly , severe economic problems in several countries , an immigration crisis , and occasional terrorist attacks i 'd say europe has its own potential for instability as well . 
  many developing countries are growing their gdps at nearly 7 % per year . 
  with strong economic growth , uprisings are incredibly unlikely , even with many other problems in a society . 
  i think europe is more prone to major problems than some third-world countries . 
  being more powerful could also help prevent wars/annexation on your doorstep . 
  if putin had a healthy respect for and fear of the eu , i dont think he would even attempt his current shenanigans . 
  so hellish that europe 's brightest people want to move here . 
   i do n't know how that fits in this thread because i think america 's business friendly environment is a factor in us braindraining the world . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  have you been to russia ? 
  its common on reddit and other left-wing environments to use `` corporate '' , `` corporations '' , and `` the rich '' as scary-sounding buzzwords and to paint everything as corporations vs the people . 
  high taxes = good . 
  lots of regulations = good . 
  big corporations = evil . 
  but its not that simple . 
  the interests of industry and the people are tightly intertwined . 
  its not always one vs the other , although sometimes it can be . 
  a good business-friendly environment can pay huge dividends for a society . 
  america has some serious advantages over europe because of that . 
  ^ now ^ someone ^ will ^ get ^ butthurt ^ reply ^ and ^ to ^ tell ^ me ^ what ^ a ^ hellish , ^ fascist , ^ corporatocracy ^ i ^ live ^ in . 
   you would also get people referring to the constitution why such a change would be illegal . 
  no you would n't . 
  lets say you were to abolish or limit filibusters you definitely do n't need to amend to constitution to change senate procedural rules, 
   should n't switzerland just handle this entirely by themselves ? 
  why does the us feel they have to stick their nose into it . 
  the us can go fuck itself . 
  switzerland has been allowing this corruption right under their nose for decades . 
   the us is the single worst human rights violator on the planet . 
  tell me about it . 
  my wife was flogged just yesterday for leaving the house without me . 
  you know this is an american website , right ? 
  i do n't go to www.tea-and-crumpets.co.uk and complain about all the englishmen posting there . 
   vast majority of americans with the `` american exceptionalism '' mentality are conservatives , who are essentially a dying breed . 
  there are two incorrect statements there . 
  i know plenty of patriotic left-wingers . 
  maybe not the young `` dae warren/sanders ??? '', 
  leftists , but its hardly just conservatives . 
  american exceptionalism is a part of our culture . 
  and the gop just assraped the democrats in the most recent major election . 
  they control both chambers of congress , a majority of governorships , a majority of state legislatures , and a majority of scotus . 
  i would n't call conservatives a dying breed . 
   the us in particular is very fond of territorial disputes [ 1 ] . 
  that 's a dumb statement . 
  did you notice how extremely minor most of the disputes are ? 
  few countries have closer relations than the us and canada . 
  the rocks and waterways officially disputed between them are pretty much a non-issue . 
  even the most significant us territorial dispute is nothing compared to kashmir , south china sea , kuril islands , etc. 
  i believe they 'll be buying 48 stovl f-35s for the new carriers . 
  how many they 'll acquire in addition to that , and over how long of a time frame is probably something no one knows for sure yet , not even the raf . 
  initial plans have a strong tendency to get adjusted ( usually reduced ) . 
  i do n't know about their typhoon fleet . 
  built to have a pissing contest with the turks over some rocks in the agean, 
  texans with ar-15s vote for the politicians in dc . 
  of course so do the liberal weenies . 
  and most of those colonies still have n't recovered . 
  but you assholes will still get on your high horse and talk shit every time an american farts . 
  i love how a topic that has nothing to do with the us has turned into a `` dae america sucks ??? '', 
  thread, 
  i saw that poster at a bus stop in copenhagen . 
  if america is n't exceptional why did you study our language ? 
  why do you browse our websites , watch our movies , and use our technology every day ? 
  you probably use an iphone , eat american junk food , fap to american porn , read american books , follow american politics , etc. 
  if you ca n't stand americans maybe you should hang out on europoor.com and talk in your irrelevent language instead of spending time on an american website . 
   the american goverment is executing people without trial . 
  he openly took credit for the attacks, 
   assuming he 's actually guilty he openly took credit for the attacks, 
  yeah because he was just a random muslim right ? 
  needs more bald eagles . 
  being a teenager and a lefty is redundant . 
   and the us government turns a blind eye ` because muh oils ' . 
  the us gets a large majority of its oil domestically and from canada . 
  within a few years we wo n't be importing at all and we will actually be a net exporter . 
  in fact , europe imports way more fossil fuels from authoritarian shitholes than the us does . 
  `` because muh oils '' is retarded . 
  oil is a big factor in geopolitics , but anyone who just spouts `` the us is evil because muh oils '' is an idiot and does n't know what he 's talking about . 
  the us backs saudi arabia because its better than the alternative . 
  if we stop supporting them , they 'll go to russia for support and military equipment . 
  a close russian-saudi friendship would be a huge disaster for the rest of the world . 
  look at the problems russia is causing with gas exports . 
  imagine that * plus * saudi oil exports . 
  they 'd have the world by the balls . 
  and as much as the saudi royals suck , how would they be replaced and what do you think they could be replaced with ? 
  if the royals were deposed , we 'd probably see another syria with various extremist factions killing each other for control . 
  the brits would have made them a colony . 
   actually this was only introduced by the us ' bestestest friends in the region , the saudi 's and their vile form of islam . 
  you 're right , we should totally tell the saudis to piss off and let them fall into the russian sphere of influence .
