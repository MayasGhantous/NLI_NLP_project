  if the snp offers a coalition to whomever offers them another referendum , that would be in the interest of their voting base i think . 
  no but the font was going out of wack at the time . 
  when you switch between english and chinese it sometimes doesnt wish to change fonts properly . 
  happens on most computers that primarily chinese in my experience .

  that is a very interesting situation , your economy will suffer from a lack of candidates . 
  does jersey have any ability to control visas and try to get more people working there , or does this remain in control of london ? 
  well in terms of what the government wants to do about letting people ? 
  you are perhaps correct in that regard . 
  i studied marketing in university , not engineering . 
  i also completely understand that you wish to protect the locals as well . 
  i mean from the perspective of italy , sure the government should prevent me from getting a work visa . 
  i used to speak italian at a b2 level ( and could probably get back to that point quickly ) , but the unemployment rate is so high there . 
  with countries like germany , austria and even poland and czech that are doing well , i am less sure there has to be such high standards . 
  maybe this is just being frustrated because i would really love to live here and become apart of society here , but i have literally had interviews where they said i am the best candidate for the job and yet they will have to hire the second best candidate because they from the eu . 
  we are talking about international sales jobs where they do a lot of business with the us ( where i am from ) and asia ( where i was just living ) . 
  also have sales experience as well ... i mean it does n't feel justified in my opinion . 
  there would n't be a worry that i 'd integrate nor that i would n't do the job well . 
  do have a second round skype next month for austria , so who knows things may change . 
  regardless though i am headed back to asia so life is not so bad i guess , a very first world problem . 
  i was under the impression that countries like germany were also in need of skilled workers as well . 
  mayhaps i mistunderstood . 
  well there is little reason for politicians to make such programs . 
  i went to an interview in prague , krakow ( skype ) and zagreb , but they decided to go with an eu candidate and they literally all said it just would n't make sense to got through all that nonsense . 
  what u/maestroni said is true . 
  yea i just spent the last two and half months running around ( mostly central ) europe doing interviews and skyping as well . 
  no luck so far and i am going to leave friday ( although the last interview went really well and we will skype the second round in mid december ) . 
  all i can think is that i am western , with a pretty decent university education and young ( and really wanting to live here/integrate ) ... so why no visa programs ? 
  politics is the answer . 
  if anything invest in the gay areas because the next step will be gentrification . 
  i was thinking about heading from bratislava to vienna and then down to zagreb ( after stopping in slovenia as well ) . 
  is this plan no longer viable ? 
  your problems are comparartively adorable . 
  i would say you have drank the cool aid , but my guess is that you feel the same for me . 
  let us wait and see what happens how this system we have in place works out . 
  i will get a job over here in europe and i will just let you do your thing over there , where we belong eh . 
  all fair points . 
  with japan though , i would n't blame the system as much as the culture conflicting with the system . 
  for sure we would have to make some major changes in the constitution and to be honest we are long over do with those . 
  between the war on drugs , ending of unions and trickle down economics , there is no way i could entertain the idea of reagan being even remotely positive . 
  he is the reason we have so many problems today . 
  i was born into the lower middle class and my parents are doing better today ( still lower middle class maybe , due to the change in parameters over time ) . 
  in the states there was still little afforded to me , so much debt it is ridiculous . 
  now it hardly matters what % of billionaires are self made . 
  you realize that not everyone can be rich right ? 
  the system is designed for a small number of people can accumulate wealth . 
  to be honest , why the fuck does that even matter when so many parents cant afford fucking health insurance and kids cant afford university . 
  that is a bit selfish to expect the rich just to make the wealth at the expense of the poor and just hold it all . 
  do you really expect society to progress in those conditions ? 
  i 'm suprised you can stand being on this subreddit , i mean you are a darling of american ideals , but that does n't fly so well in europe . 
  haha yea , that is exactly what reagan had in mind . 
  very true , but the nationalism we see is sort of acting as a way to show the flaws in the system here in europe . 
  in my opinion scotland and various other nations should be countries as well . 
  that is not the whole picture with nationalism of course . 
  well he is just anti everything is n't he ? 
  i was talking more about how they would respectively act if elected president . 
  now if we were to consider campaigns , i see what you mean . 
  in that regard trump is being more upfront ... which is his whole platform . 
  yea i meant the whole system haha , i do n't see how you could have a prime minister in our current system . 
  i think the most effective would be no longer presidents , but a prime minister like the uk . 
  no first past post bullshit though . 
  very true . 
  but even the top 10 or 15 % have it pretty nice maybe . 
  unsure where the drop off really begins . 
  well after spending some time at a hedgefund , i can tell you that the stock market is simply a tool in which the top 2-5 % can make money off of the rest . 
  so unless you are in that top category , i do n't see why you would want to disagree with sanders . 
  in terms of taxing the rich not being a good idea , do you support trickle down economics ? 
  unless i missed something since reagan was in office , it has not really worked . 
  right now the rich have so much wealth and the poor have so little in the us , because of how the tax system is designed . 
  so why would the bottom 80 % want to continue this gap in wealth , there is little benefit for the public at large . 
  agreed , i mean if things are n't working ... do you try and fix it or just leave it the same ? 
  of course you try to fix it and sure you might screw up once in a while , nobody is perfect . 
  with clinton or bush you have the same nonsense . 
  with bernie and hell even trump you will see some changes . 
  one of those would be a bit better though haha . 
  if you think about it , if the us had a system like the uk for example , you would see maybe 5 or 6 major parties . 
  bernie leading the far left . 
  hilary leading the center , but slightly left . 
  bush center right . 
  trump would have his own berlusconi esc party . 
  then of course you would maybe see the crazy christian party ( huckabee ) and then maybe a libertarian party or something . 
  that really shows the picture of american politics , there are too many differing opinions for just two parties . 
  well i am in europe myself , so i could n't tell you from `` on the ground '' experience . 
  a lot of my friends back in the states , mostly mid twenties , really like him though . 
  more on the point , what do mean by a lack of rationality ? 
  bernie represents the people as far as i can tell , he does n't seem to be pro big business like hilary , trump and the rest . 
  the states is currently an oligarchy , he could change this unlike all other candidates . 
  i guess we just see it different . 
  for me if you kill him , you are lowering down to his level . 
  also if he is locked up , the victims will never see him again no ? 
  that is what life imprisonment means last i checked . 
  they have a right to rot away , that is the only life they are allowed after they have proved they can no longer belong in society . 
  now if you asked whether or not i approve of physician assisted suicide , especially for inmates , of course i support that . 
  i think the only life a person has the right to end , is there own . 
  so you reserve the right to say somebody no longer has a a right to life ? 
  i do n't think i could ever definitively say that . 
  putting somebody away though , in a case such as this it is pretty clear they should n't be on the streets . 
  death penalty ? 
  that is kind of medieval in my opinion . 
  giving them a life sentence and having them serve in limestone mine for the rest of their life or something such as this would be more appropriate i think .
