what can i say ? 
  we learned it from our european big brothers . 
  wait , russa + the soviet union has only had 18,000 military deaths since world war ii ? 
  that seems tiny compared to the u.s. with 58,307 in vietnam , 36,574 in korea , 4,809 in iraq ( 2003 - ) . 
  by my math ( using numbers from this [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_military_casualties_of_war ) page ) , the u.s. has had 87,054 combat deaths since wwii . 
  399,562 total casualties . 
  one could say that you 're up to the tops of your lederhosen in vomit ? 
  haha , the state of lower saxony 's ownership of vw has some hilarious history to it . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkswagen_law ) :  due to the volkswagen law , which has recently been ruled illegal by the european union 's high court , the state of lower saxony is still the second largest shareholder , owning 20.3 % of the company . 
  the [ volkswagen law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkswagen_law ) :  the volkswagen law is a set of german federal laws enacted in 1960 regulating the privatization of volkswagenwerk gmbh into volkswagen ag . 
  [ 1 ] in order to maintain government control in the privately owned company , it stipulated dass die voting on major shareholder meeting resolutions require 4 / 5th ( 80 % ) agreement . 
  the one where western europe + scandinavia is the liberal utopia that maher dreams of . 
  you could put up fans with water misters instead to avoid the shower metaphor . 
  i live in texas . 
  we never have showers to help people cool down . 
  occasionally , restaurants will have fans with water misters . 
   you are 49.5 % european , and you scored closest to belgium , with a similarity of 64.4 % !, 
   i can agree the u.s does make good food if you go to the right places , tex-mex and cajun food are my favourites . 
  as a texan , i 've always been amazing that despite the close proximity of texas and louisiana , they 're quite different culturally , in terms of both food and people . 
  i 'd say texas has more in common with the midwest than with our neighbor to the east . 
  i 've also never felt more like a foreigner in the u.s. ( and i 've travelled all over ) than in louisiana . 
   that 's because both countries are about mass consumption and not necessarily quality . 
  i 'd clarify that the u.s. is about ** sameness ** of a brand across different regions . 
  you can get the same burger at any mcdonalds , and mcdonalds goes to great lengths to make this possible . 
  there 's pros and cons to it : on one hand , it 's nice to know and be confident about the service you 'll receive at a restaurant before you go . 
  on the other hand , it sucks to go to a random suburb and only see chains . 
  unless you 're in a city , you have to go out of your way to find an independent restaurant . 
  although , i tend to avoid most nation-wide , american fast food ( mostly to eat healthier ) , except for chipotle and starbucks . 
   the u.s consumes a lot of coffee though per person , but they ; like canada , do n't really care about making an amazing brew . 
  coffee is both a mass-consumed but also a niche culture with growing popularity . 
  the u.s. came to the coffee shop culture relatively late when compared to europe . 
  i remember the first coffee shop opening up in the late 1990s in the houston suburb that i grew up in . 
  it felt like a strange idea at the time ( a place that only sells coffee ) , but now i ca n't imagine life without it . 
   you can find good coffee in every major city in north america though , especially montreal and toronto which have thriving independent coffee shop industries . 
  i think seattle has one too . 
  seattle is the coffee capital of the u.s. ( and headquarters of starbucks and seattle 's best coffee ) . 
  as someone who drinks coffee without cream or sugar , i actually find starbucks coffee very tasty , sometimes even better than local roasters . 
  but i like to support local coffee shops whenever i can , otherwise they wo n't last . 
  i 'm surprised that canadians know what a beach is . 
  i did too . 
  our citizenship laws are both unique and weird . 
  while ted cruz was born in calgary , he is considered a `` natural born citizen '' because his mother is a u.s. citizen : from [ polifact ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/mar/26/ted-cruz-born-canada-eligible-run-president-update/ ) :  if that 's the definition , then cruz is a natural born citizen by being born to an american mother and having her citizenship at birth . 
  the congressional research service , the agency tasked with providing authoritative research to all members of congress , published a report after the 2008 election supporting the thinking that `` natural born '' citizenship means citizenship held `` at birth . '', 
  obama 's mother was also a u.s. citizen at the time of his birth , so even if he was n't actually born in hawaii , he would still have the `` natural born '' claim , similar to ted cruz . 
  this fact makes the birther conspiracy even more ridiculous . 
  we would apologize , but then canadians would apologize back . 
   have to disagree with your 6th picture . 
  ask any italian , he will tell you the dark liquid that americans drink has no connection whatsoever with `` coffee '' . 
  when i first visited italy ( and western europe ) , i was annoyed by the lack of `` real '' drip coffee . 
  ironically , i almost exclusively drink espresso drinks now ( mostly americanos ) . 
   but on food , i have to disagree . 
  yes you exported the `` fastfood '' concept to the entire world ... but usofa is home of other delicious monstrosities like the sushirrito ( `` sushi burrito '' ) , as well as some of the best steaks in the world . 
  if you want to eat great food in the us ( especially in the big cities ) , you definitely can . 
  i 've never had a sushirrito . 
  chipotle offers a quesarito . 
  the u.s. has no problem making great tasting food ; we just add ridiculous amounts of sugar and cream to everything . 
  we learned from you , big brother . 
  in case you missed [ my comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3hekpw/so_you_want_to_visit_the_united_states/cu6pgq1 ) on why i posted this in / r/europe :  i enjoyed your albums , so i hope you do n't mind me stepping out on a limb and making one for the u.s. , featuring both the good and the bad . 
  norwegians are better looking . 
  thanks !, 
  cheers to you also !, 
   cruz is a natural-born u.s. citizen oops , that was the phrasing i was looking for : `` natural-born , '' not `` naturalized . '', 
  thanks for pointing that out . 
   also , `` capitol '' is the seat of government . 
  that 's why where congress meets is called capitol hill . 
  `` capital '' is money . 
  was this just an fyi or a suggested correction ? 
  i double-checked ; i believed i use * capital * correctly here . 
  borderline . 
  the crash certainly was n't intentional . 
  usually when i think of covert operations , i 'm thinking of agents or soldiers on the ground for a period of time . 
  technically , we were never at direct war , proxy war , or covert operations inside of russia ( that i know of ) . 
  but you 're right on the others . 
  i was looking for maps under a shareable license , and this was the best i found . 
  or put it in a taco . 
  i 'm surprised someone named / u/growlingtaco would forget about our texmex . 
  good idea !, 
  done, 
  i enjoyed your albums , so i hope you do n't mind me stepping out on a limb and making one for the u.s. , featuring both the good and the bad . 
  what is with europeans and smoking , the availability of cigarettes , and smoking in public ? 
  smoking seems to be one of the few issues that the us is far more progressive on in terms of banning smoking in public , making them more expensive , and hard to buy . 
  for instance : paris allows smoking in restaurants . 
  germany had cigarette vending machines on the side of the road . 
  not to suggest we 're the best at it , i 'm just curious as to why . 
  this is why i should n't try to make jokes just before going to sleep . 
  i also suspect my english/scottish ancestry may have had some subtle influence . 
  do you think the english/scottish/welsh island looks like a wizard with a large hat ? 
  norway is unique with [ the oil fund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_pension_fund_of_norway ) . 
  having $ 800b usd in assets gives you a lot of options . 
  let 's do some math : 500b nok is $ 60.99 b usd for oil . 
  340b nok is $ 40.25 b usd for manufactured goods . 
  $ 100 billion in exports for a country of 5 million people is $ 20,000 per capita , between those two categories . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_exports_per_capita ) puts the total at $ 32,000 , which is the 6th highest in the world . 
  not the worst situation to be in , but norway should probably look to diversify into more industries . 
  keep in mind , the koch brothers can hire the best lawyers available . 
  if there 's a way to get around the law , they 'll find it . 
  * cough * are n't you forgetting someone ? 
  you 're not still mad about that tea party we threw without you ? 
  oil !, 
  i think norway needs us to bring it some freedom .
