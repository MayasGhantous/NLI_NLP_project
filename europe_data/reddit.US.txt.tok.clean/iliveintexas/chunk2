  [ originally posted 2 days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fmn3w/cranes_collapse_while_hoisting_a_bridge_part_in/ ) , the bbc is now reporting that no one was injured . 
  there are still a [ large number of articles ] ( https://news.google.com/news/story?ncl=dwtlun16hrvvcom0mznei49lqinam&amp;q=netherlands+crane&amp;lr=english&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ccoqqgiwagovchmizpphpaesxwivhzinch31daxn ) reporting injuries , but these are older than the bbc article . 
  can anyone from the netherlands confirm which story is accurate on injuries ?

  the river appears to be the oude rijn ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oude_rijn_ ( utrecht_and_south_holland \\ ) ) ) . 
  i ca n't find any certain number on how deep it could be there . 
  based on city rivers of that size , 20-25 feet ( 7-8 meters ) is very possible . 
  i 'm curious how expensive something like a [ jackup rig ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jackup_rig ) would be to move heavy objects over canals .

  senators have [ real power ] ( http://www.senate.gov/history/powers.htm ) over nominations , treaties , and investigations . 
  does the house of lords have similar powers ? 
   your description flags the gop as being associated with finance . 
  i wrote that quickly , but i agree . 
  i threw big business in for both parties , but you 're absolutely right , wall street makes major contributions to democrats as well . 
  on the other hands , i hear many more democrats willing to criticize wall street than i do republicans . 
   the democratic party really is n't socialist by any stretch of the imagination . 
  i would say the democratic party includes socialists . 
  although american socialism is more conservative by european standards . 
   this leaves out the small parties . 
  these are very weak , due to the structure of the political system , but they have occasionally gotten influence at a local level . 
  i left them out because the smaller parties , with the exception of the tea party , have had little impact at the federal level . 
  it 's not my choice , but most voters only hear of these parties when they see them listed on a ballot . 
   in practice , the policies of the two major parties do n't differ very much -- that is , there are only small policy changes as control switches . 
  i will disagree with you here . 
  democrats and republicans are opposite on a lot of issues that i would n't call small . 
  sure , there are some similarities , but calling them the same misrepresents their positions on issues and the types of legislation they support . 
   but let say they will refuse to do so , and the republicans are going downhill . 
  republicans would n't refuse to do so . 
  the party 's main goal is to get elected . 
  that , above anything else , will drive their positions on issues . 
  our two party system is self-correcting in that manner . 
   wouldnt this make the us a defacto dictatorship of the democratic party ? 
  at the moment , there 's still more support for the republicans in terms of voter base . 
  the growing minority populations in the u.s. ( particularly hispanics ) [ do not have good voter turnout rates ] ( http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/demographics ) ( the issue is quite complicated actually , since poorer minorities are more likely to have to jump through several hoops to get the proper documents in order to vote ; see the history of [ voter id laws in the u.s. ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voter_id_laws_in_the_united_states ) ) . 
   i am just wondering why isnt there the will in the us present to introduce a proportional parlament like in most democracies ? 
  i 'm not an expert on every european form of government , but the responsibilities of government are split between the federal ( national ) , state , and local ( city ) levels . 
  the u.s. congress ( our legislature ) only operates to pass laws and budgets . 
  with respect to some issues , the president acts separately from congress ( e.g. , defense , foreign policy , justice department ) . 
  on other issues , he has to act more closely ( health care , social safety net , treaties ) . 
   quite honestly just from my outside perspective i think both parties are kind of horrible and think that already the majority of americans are outside the pattern ( politically ) than the two big parties . 
  no disagreement here . 
  both parties work together to subvert the popularity of third parties . 
  imo , most americans are too busy with work and life to want to spend time to understand the intricacies of our political system . 
  much of the news that they follow falls under political theater . 
   what did you mean by place of my life ? 
  i live in poland , and i am white . 
  if i were a black american , would republicans not be my choice ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure what you mean by `` place of my life , '' but i 'll move on to your second question . 
  the republican party ( and it 's media arm fox news ) have n't been sympathetic about the rise of police brutality and tend to always side with the police on case of police brutality ( unless there is clear evidence of police wrongdoing , but these cases tend to be few in number ) . 
  there are a few republicans who are trying to reform the criminal justice system in the u.s. ( like [ rand paul ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02be1lxnyi ) ) . 
  republicans will have to find more voters . 
  i would n't risk carrying a gun into europe . 
  they laws vary too much , and the amount of time you 'd have to spend to make sure you 're legal would probably outweigh the benefit . 
  technically and legally speaking , it should n't . 
  in practice , it depends on where you live . 
  assuming you 're white , yes . 
  exactly . 
  allow me to explain american political parties by the groups they represent : republican party - conservatives , big business ( e.g. , walmart ) , wall street/finance , conservative christians , pro-life/anti-abortion , tea party/libertarians , war hawks , military veterans , states rights advocates , pro gun-rights , anti-immigration , anti-minimum wage , anti-lgbt rights , anti-intellectualism , pro-death penalty democratic party - liberals , big business ( e.g. , costco ) , liberal christians , pro-choice/pro-abortions rights , socialists , unions , minorities ( blacks , hispanics , asians , muslims , jews , native americans ) , atheists/secularists , pro-gun control , pro-minimum wage , pro-lgbt-rights , anti-death penalty,

  nonetheless , it 's an interesting look at u.s. state economies .

  one thing i 've always been curious about : what 's with cigarette consumption in europe ? 
  many ( some even very advance ) countries than the u.s. seem to have [ higher rates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita ) of cigarette consumption ( switzerland , austria , belgium , denmark , italy , spain , germany ; also south korea , japan ) . 
  not only that , but a few places that i 've been do not have no smoking laws ( e.g. 
  paris ) or even have cigarette vending machines ( e.g. 
  i usually think of many european countries as having more liberal laws compared to the u.s. , but this seems backwards .
