  i always thought the [ telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10003467/berlin-satellite-image-reveals-stark-east-west-divisions.html ) 's [ berlin at night ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02540/chris-hadfield-ber_2540064b.jpg ) photo was a great metaphor for the west-east divide . 
  just look at it : the stadium is half falling apart . 
  there 's an old church with a big hole in the ceiling . 
  and the city residents just stole a bunch of egyptian obelisks . 
  as an avid fan of both last week tonight and the daily show , i think too many people see jon stewart and john oliver as a replacement for learning about news . 
  what jon stewart and john oliver do is a form of comedic art , not a form of news . 
  western cultures ( particularly here in the u.s. ) have shown an inability to think critically about the news , particularly distinguishing fact from opinion in news . 
  news of previous generations had a clearer wall of separation from the factual news section and the opinion sections . 
  these days , many of the most popular news sources have a self-described bias . 
  i will give credit to john oliver for tackling really tough , normally boring issues like civil forfeiture or net neutrality in an entertaining fashion . 
  i do n't see other comedians attempting to take on these issues . 
  that 's an understatement . 
  this looks like a set out of [ the grand budapest hotel ] ( https://www.weekendoffender.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/the-grand-budapest-hotel-uk-quad-poster.jpg ), 
  i 'd be surprised if krugman could find time in his busy schedule as an obama apologist . 
  i would just be happy with discounts on afternoon tea , but the free wine on transat flights with british airways is good enough . 
  as an american , could i have used this to get into everything for free in paris ? 
  or at least some free water at cafes . 
  damn , i wish i had thought of this ... 
  true . 
  fun story : my wife and i honeymooned in norway , taking the norway in a nutshell train ride from [ bergen to oslo ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/dir/bergen,+norway/oslo,+norway/ ) ( furtherest point west in norway to the east side of norway ) , which covered 485km . 
  we later took a weekend trip to south padre island from [ austin to south padre island ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/dir/austin,+tx/south+padre+island,+tx/ ) ( 200km southeast of the central point of texas to the furthest southern point of texas ) , a 7 hour drive that covered 597km . 
  norway was much prettier though . 
  given norway 's size and mountainous back roads ( which would suck to get stuck with a dead battery ) , what kind of drivers are buying electric cars ? 
  commuters ? 
  my favorite measure is debt to gdp ratio , which can make your deficit spending feel much better . 
  if that did n't work , his other strategy was the village people route . 
  ** barack obama ** : 44th president of the united states ; democrat . 
  took office in 2008 . 
  won re-election in 2012 . 
  his final term will end in 2016 ( 2 term limit on presidents ) . 
  prior to becoming president , he was a junior senator ( for the u.s. congress ) from illinois . 
  prior to that , a illinois state senator ( as in , for the state of illinois ) . 
  ** the good ** : * tackled health care through the affordable care act ( obamacare ) . 
  the act was the most significant and transformative legislation passed in a generation ( imo ) . 
  eliminated unpopular restrictions on health insurance coverage ( pre-existing conditions , policy maximums , extended coverage on certain conditions ) . 
  extended coverage to children under parents ' plans . 
  instituted a mandate to purchase health care . 
  of course , this law is n't without it 's controversy . 
  * economic recovery on a national level . 
  you ca n't give credit entirely to just the president , but he certainly made a lot of controversial decisions in 2009-2010 that have paid off well . 
  however , much of the recovery has benefited the most wealthy . 
  wages have not improved ; costs of living have gone up . 
  * reduction of foreign policy : obama has been more hesitant about commit the u.s. military/aid to foreign conflicts , due to the fall out from the iraq war . 
  * oversaw operation that killed of osama bin laden . 
  * expansion of gay rights . 
  not entirely obama 's doing , but he has enabled the proper atmosphere in washington to let this happen . 
  * discontinued use of `` enhanced interrogation techniques . '', 
  * started process to re-establish diplomatic relations with cuba . 
  ** the bad ** : * continued many unpopular bush policies ( gitmo , nsa mass surveillance , patriot act ) * extra-judicial , secretive drone strikes . 
  although this is viewed as a successful tactic in the `` war on terrorism , '' there 's very little public oversight of this program and little accountability for how it 's being used . 
  * withdrew from iraq too early . 
  iraq was n't ready to go on it 's own . 
  there were a lot of wasted resources in training the iraq army , building infrastructure that 's not being used . 
  * failure to hold large banks accountable for the role they played in causing the 2008 global financial crisis . 
  * serious questions remain about the affordability of health care . 
  not to mention , republicans have tried to gut this law at every opportunity . 
  * no progress made on campaign finance reform . 
  in fact , political donations have become much less transparent since 2008 with super pacs . 
  ** neutral ** : * reduction of deficit spending . 
  given the gravity of the 2008 financial crisis , it 's difficult for me to blame him for nearly doubling our national debt , but i do n't regard this as a positive point of his presidency . 
  since my post was a serious one , i 'll leave you with the famous clip of [ barack obama killing a fly with laser focus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzgos8dbf64 ) . 
  edit : added cuba . 
  nah dawg , you got it wrong . 
  ` murica was the first * real * democracy . 
  all those other democracies were just practice for the real thing . 
   they had started building one before the war , but had very little to work with in the 1930s so it took a while same in true with the british and americans . 
  both nations did not prepared in advance . 
  as much as people hate on neville chamberlain for his policy of appeasement towards hitler , he was realistic about where the british were in terms of armed forces and knew britain was n't prepared for a war . 
  he needed to buy time . 
  fdr realized that same mistake and instituted a peacetime draft in september 1940 , a year after germany invaded poland , and 1.25 years before japan attacked pearl harbor . 
  pretty much , only the germans and japanese were the most prepared for war by 1939 ( and they both eventually lost ) . 
  the same is true of a few of the major powers of world war i. 
  it was surprising for me to realize that the biggest wars in history were n't well-planned from the beginning . 
  unfortunately , not being well-planned means the common foot solider feels the brunt of that mistake . 
  `` damnit , the germans beat us to it ! '', 
  til hitler was both a shitty writer and painter . 
   it 's obviously a metaphor , it does n't actually mean france and germany are at war . 
  it 's a shitty metaphor to make on the part of foreign policy . 
  france and germany were the front lines of the two bloodiest wars in human history ( not to mention how many wars before that ) . 
  of course , no one expect modern france and modern germany to ever go to war again . 
   you pretend that america does n't have it 's own tax havens , where some of the biggest companies have an actual negative tax rate . 
  i never said anything one way or the other about u.s. tax havens . 
  there 's a good reasons a lot of major corporations are incorporated in delaware . 
  nonetheless , many of the major tech companies are located in silicon valley , california , one of the most expensive states with respect to taxes . 
  it 's true . 
  a bad campaign really . 
  he could very well be president if it were n't for his family name . 
  is this surprising ? 
  this is why tech companies come to ireland , for less taxes . 
  higher taxation is going to make ireland less attractive to open offices in . 
  is there oil in sweden ? 
  if so , we 'd be glad to lend a hand . 
  $ 6b for norway is around $ 1200 per capita in defense spending . 
  for comparison , the u.s. spends $ 1941 per capita . 
  i enjoyed a kolache ( not my first ) on my road trip today in texas . 
  thanks czech and slovakia !, 
  in fairness , large-scale wars did n't start until the late 1700s .
