you just got me thinking ( which is n't always good . 
  a lot of stupid comes out of my head ) , how close is belarus to russian ideals than the way the rest of eastern european countries are headed ( post soviet ) ? 
  politically , homosexuality was never a talking point . 
  not until aids started spreading into the limelight , did the conversation even begin . 
  i 'd say the world has come a *** long *** way in the past 30 years , when it comes to sexual equality . 
  regardless of where we are now , it 's so insanely different than where it was then . 
  * lithuania : hey , at least we 're not russia !, 
  so kind of like how the us has a `` civil union '' in many states ? 
  it 's not marriage , per se , but it 's legally the same thing ? 
  islam has already taken both countries over , and the jihad will be branching out from them , into the rest of the western world . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ swear ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ fucking ^ ^ ^ ^ god , ^ ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ need ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ add ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ * sarcasm * ^ ^ ^ ^ tag ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ comment , ^ ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ ^ stupid ^ ^ ^ ^ mother ^ ^ ^ ^ fuckers . 
  so much in your response is wrong . 
  i 'm not even sure where to start . 
   palestine is not a country umm ... 
  yes it is . 
   have two separate governments and are incredibly corrupt huh , like every industrialized nation in the world . 
  in the sense that two different political parties have two completely different views on how a country should be ran ... see : democrats and republicans in the usa  the people who would like it to be a country oh , you mean [ these people ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_recognition_of_the_state_of_palestine ) keep your shitty , bullshit propaganda to your self . 
  ** edit ** : lol . 
  my bad . 
  i did n't even notice your flair . 
  is kosovo included with serbia 's index ? 
  what salute did the ref do ? 
  i watched the game and do n't remember that . 
  a nazi salute ? 
  socialist commie pinkos !!!!, 
  that too . 
  basically . 
  institut fran\u00e7ais d'opinion publique - * institute of french public opinion * . 
  you 're begging for russia to make a stabilization of military presence in ukraine if `` ethnic russians '' are attacked . 
  if a war is had , it would be because putin feels threatened and counter with aggression . 
  any shots fired will solidify eastern ukraine being obsorbed into russia . 
  putin is trying to get the band back together . 
  i would n't be surprised if belarus is `` annexed '' back into ~ ~ the ussr ~ ~ russia . 
  since they 're still a world power , people are keenly listening to what russia is saying . 
  and by listening , i mean the military actions they 're orcestrating . 
  if russia continues to `` invade '' ukraine , the west ( specifically us and uk ) will be forced to intervene . 
  this ordeal will soon come to a bad conclusion . 
  once the aggressors are confronted , russia 's allies will poke their heads out . 
  the only thing stopping a catastrophic conclusion is how much europe and the us allow putin to force his will on a sovereign nation . 
  which from the look of things they 're hanging ukraine out to dry . 
  but no , the west has placed sanctions upon russia . 
  obviously putin is running scared as their economy slips away . 
  the sactions are working guys !, 
  it 's stopped russian movement !, 
  oh , i 'm with you . 
  i certainly consider them closer to europe . 
  just my weak attempt at a joke . 
  it was my weak attempt at what i just learned about the finns being closer related to asia than europe . 
  you 're a finn though . 
  you 're practically asian already . 
  a lot of americans could probably only be able to place about 15-20 states . 
  i could see alabama and mississippi getting messed up , along with wyoming and colorado . 
  new hampshire and vermont , people would probably botch . 
  heck , i would n't even be surprised of people screwed up illinois and indiana . 
  and this is all assuming they can * name * all 50 . 
  hey , we still shoot rockets up there , we just do n't have astronauts on them anymore . 
  so it would be like the kaliningrad oblast ? 
  just a little satellite region ? 
   carried into space by russian rocket dnepr , together with 31 other satellites . 
  polan can into hopping on train like hobo . 
  [ here you go . 
  and then there was romania . 
  in case somebody 's wondering : \\ ^ \\ ^ ^ the blue parts produce the majority of ukraine 's gdp . 
  the only thing on my frontpage are these stupid anti-super bowl posts . 
  even in / r/all . 
  but i 'm picky about what subs i 'm on and filter the fuck out of / r/all . 
  for not knowing anything about , sure is a lot of shit talked about it . 
  if i did n't know anything about the world cup , i would n't go around posting pictures of enormous sports cups . 
  any rough translations to the dialogue ? 
  the youtube russian   english captions are less than stellar . 
  a couple in algeria as well . 
  santa is killing his reindeer ? 
  no , he means * rap\u00e9 * . 
  op can snort all that karma . 
  or : why do n't we change the `` na '' in nasa the `` north american '' . 
  and canada can contribute with the us , and maybe mexico and some central american countries ( that can afford it ) . 
  til canada is in europe . 
   kgb ... * hhmmm *, 
  sarcasm detected, 
  why have a bar that only serves port ? 
  what does russia ever use that chunk of land on the baltic for ? 
  surprising not to see a port there . 
  edit : i do n't understand why i was downvoted for asking a question . 
  i apologize for not being 100 % on top of geopolitical situations . 
  although this thread branch started with a comment speaking specifically about america . 
  is that supposed to say sledding ? 
  i 'm not trying to harp on grammar , i just have no idea if in certain places in europe sledging is a thing . 
  ca n't help but imagine a bunch of estonians running around with hammers , bashing ice blocks ... 
  which sounds pretty damn fun !, 
  dat gulf stream . 
  i just recently learned it affects europe , and scandinavia , a lot more than i thought . 
  always though ireland and britain were the only ones privy to its slender . 
   i met a man yesterday . 
  he came walking over the emerald green hills of br\u00f6sarp . 
  like an angel , he appeared in front of me , squeezed my hand and told me to sit down . 
  he said that he had wandered from smygehuk , and that he had come to fart in my face . 
  i flinched , but within a fraction of one ten thousandth of a second , i found myself lying on the ground with his snow-white buttocks painfully close to my face . 
  slowly , slowly , he brought them closer and closer to me , just as close so that his sphincter almost touched my vibrating nose tip . 
  then we lay there for several minutes and just breathed .
