  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_rome specifically the russian claims . 
  yes , and i was commenting that russia considers itself to be the successor to byzantium . 
  is n't moscow third rome ? 
  dude , it 's like totally not hard to speak proper american . 
  you just got ta try hella hard . 
  like , get all swole linguistics and shit . 
  i dunno , every time there 's a world war france seems to be a battleground . 
  maybe it should be by either population size , or physical size , so really we 'd only need a californian or alaskan flag . 
  right up until the north atlantic pump turns off or moves . 
  the moon is a harsh mistress, 
  it 's not a bash . 
  it 's a simple acknowledgement that russia is so unimportant to the average american that until reminded that russia even exists probably has not given a thought to it since the last time it came up . 
  it 's just not important compared to dancing with the stars , or survivor . 
  america is living in a brave new world , and russia only exists as a story of someplace else . 
  he has to , otherwise he 'll never get past the rabid partisans of the republican party guarding the gates of the primaries . 
  i think the average american would have difficulty identifying russia on an unmarked globe of the earth . 
  mostly this is because to the average american , russia does not matter to their day to day lives . 
  it would n't even occur to the average american that they would need to care unless the need was jammed in their face . 
  someone should probably warn ireland , england , scotland , france , and northern africa . 
  from that i can guess that you 're a mentally retarded man from ohio . 
  france is our oldest ally , and should always have a place in the hearts of america . 
  france is our uncle who helped us move out of our parent 's place when the situation got really ugly . 
  the united kingdom , on the other hand , is like america 's parents . 
  we left home on really bad terms , burned our bridges really , but as america aged we realized that no matter what has happened , family is family . 
  it 's similar to our relationship with canada . 
  we like canadians , we tend not to remember about canada specifically in our day to day lives , though . 
  we mess with canada , maybe a bit too much . 
  canadians i 'm sure view us perhaps with a bit of exacerbation , maybe they think of america as a bit of a bully at times , but i hope they think of us with at least some of the time with a bit of kindness . 
  if someone else fucks with canada though , americans would view that as an attack on family . 
  it 's nothing like our relationship with mexico . 
  mexico 's our neighbor who we do n't quite like or trust , even though he helps out around the neighborhood and is willing to do hard jobs for cheap . 
  we get into disputes over the fence ( which we might have sorta moved a bit over into his yard ) , and we keep hiring his kids to do dangerous jobs around our property that we probably should n't . 
  we should probably also stop making mexico get drugs for us . 
  i mean , we pay mexico , but it 's obviously taking its toll . 
  tl ; dr america likes the uk , we think of it as distant family we only kind of understand . 
  at least they speak american over there . 
  ^ ^ / s ^ kidding ^ kindof, 
  is the court going to force all of the eu to accept a sweeping change to their copyright law , as that 's what was enabling this in the first place . 
  thanks corn flakes and graham crackers !, 
  well , you know , we have to stop masturbation . 
  germany likes the euro exactly how it is . 
  best is fairly subjective . 
  tacos are probably best from a trusted street vendor . 
  two small corn tortillas , sliced meat , and some sort of hot and spicy salsa , maybe some cilantro and cut onions and you are good to go . 
  maybe get some nice pickled jalapenos , carrots or some other vegetable on the side . 
  overall i 'd say a good mission burrito is the best burrito . 
  tortillas are just a basic building block . 
  flour tortillas for burritos and corn tortillas for tacos . 
  wraps are just pretentious white people burritos , sometimes sliced funny . 
  but seriously , [ mission burritos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mission_burrito ) . 
  the 1st rule of manifest destiny club is you do n't talk about manifest destiny club . 
  the 2nd rule of manifest destiny club is you do n't talk about manifest destiny club . 
  the 3rd rule of manifest destiny club is that if it 's your first time , you will be overthrowing a banana republic tonight . 
  turkey fears a proclaimed kurdistan far more than they fear daesh . 
  that has a lot to do with china making ~ 20 % of everything made on this planet . 
  seriously `` glitter is the herpes of craft supplies . '', 
  i grew up hearing about what the english did during the famines that drove my family to the us back in the day . 
  that and the occasional curse towards cromwell . 
  the governator is an inspiration to us all . 
  i 'm from california , and i for one support our coming spanglish overlords . 
  hella super burritos pollo asado for all !, 
  bad analogy . 
  if it 's small enough you can use the available approved fire-fighting gear , such as a fire extinguisher , to put out the fire . 
  in the case of a large or uncontrolled fire you are responsible to call the fire department , thus passing along the responsibility . 
  the question is , what are the options for useful power generation past the orbit of mars . 
  the answer does not include solar power , which peters out being useful pretty quickly as one moves past mars towards the asteroid belt . 
  most deep space probes currently use plutonium in the form of [ rtg ] ( https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/rps/rtg.cfm ) to provide both power and heat . 
  another solution would be fusion of some sort to provide that same power and heat . 
  sort of , not to the extent needed if you want results . 
  we let fusion limp along as a bastard child of potential energy generation , no one quite wanting to give it up because it would be too useful if it works out , but no one really wants to be the one to actually pay for it completely . 
  plus , the decision to go with tokamak reactors , which are glorified steam engines that produce excess neutrons that alter the very structure of the building it is in , feels like the soviet union pulling a prank on the west from beyond the grave . 
  other forms of fusion are funded at minuscule levels , or are not even explored at all . 
  also , if we want a real space program we 'll need technologies like fusion that we should be subsidizing .

  they say it openly . 
  the honestly creepy thing about the us support for israel is less about a secret zionist cabal of jews , and more about an honest belief among a disturbing large swath of educated christians in the us who happen to hold political power that in order for the second coming of christ to occur jews must hold jerusalem and cause armageddon . 
  it 's an ongoing coalition of us politicians of this strain of christian belief and those who want to play realpolitik in the middle east who support israel unilaterally with money and military equipment . 
   i believe having armies leads to war . 
  well , not having armies also leads to war . 
  you know , when the other guy who did n't eliminate their armed forces decides they like your land . 
  show me one nation who has eliminated their armed forces and is n't backed up by a nation who has an army and will defend them that has more than a decade of peace ? 
  china does not presently have the capabilities to support their forces any distance from their in-country supplies . 
  they lack force projection . 
  the chinese are working to remedy this , but they have not added this capability to their arsenal yet . 
  the indian military has been training and preparing for a large scale land conflict since 1948 . 
  the chinese might overstep and bite off significantly more than the chinese can chew if a hot conflict breaks out with india . 
  no , they have a decent military , one with the ability to defend against any non-nuclear attack from china .

  india is a natural counter to this growth . 
  did n't basically every colonial power do something like this at one point or another ? 
  seriously . 
  the county i live in has more people , and produces more electricity from geothermal sources . 
  the county i live in is n't even in the top ten counties list by population in the state i live in . 
  `` i have returned from germany with peace for our time . '', 
  the likeliest place for a blunder leading to a large scale military conflict in the world is honestly somewhere along the chinese-indian border . 
  india can push back against china better than really any of its land neighbors . 
  that they can afford to . 
  everyone spies on everyone . 
  you 're in the club , we got your back . 
  non-military ?
