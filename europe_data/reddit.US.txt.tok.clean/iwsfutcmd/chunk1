also creepy tunnels, 
  that theory , as you 've implied , is totally rejected by modern linguists . 
  basque is an isolate , not shown to be related to any other languages , and georgian is in the kartvelian language family , along with svan , laz , and mingrelian . 
  georgian has n't even been conclusively shown to be related to the other caucasian language families ( northwest caucasian , consisting of abkhaz , the circassian languages , and a few others , and northeast caucasian , the languages of chechnya , dagestan , and ingushetia ) . 
  let 's just say there 's a reason why the arabs called the caucasus '' \u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0627\u062a '' , or `` the mountain of languages . '', 
  funny , i 'm from san francisco and i 'd love to live in georgia for a little while . 
  i spent my spring break there some years back and completely fell in love with the place . 
  i always tell my friends that i 've been to 43 countries and tbilisi is the most romantic city i 've ever visited . 
  now , for my question : what 's the largest number of khinkali you 've eaten in one sitting ? 
  immigrants ? 
  i studied a little bit of dutch , and when i was in the netherlands , i remember the only time i actually needed to use it was in chinese restaurants . 
  [ yep !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welsh_independence ) about 10 % , according to the most recent poll . 
  no further comment from me , but i just want to give you props for making sure your kids are fluent in irish - preserving endangered languages is very important and very difficult , and anyone who keeps that line of transmission going deserves a lot of praise in my book . 
  just curious , are they in a gaelscoil ? 
  obviously it was n't some kind of field-day for gay people in other european countries , but they generally did n't have sodomy laws on the books , unlike the british . 
  personally , i do n't use any terminology , as i do n't and have never worked with any slavic languages ( or honestly , any indo-european languages at all ) . 
  but basically , it depends on context . 
  a linguist might use any of the common terms in use , but probably with some kind of disclosure that they are n't endorsing any one term over another . 
  i 'd say using the individual terms ( serbian , croatian , bosnian , etc. ), 
  would be more common nowadays because that 's how the speakers of those languages usually refer to their own language . 
  because that 's what quite a few people call it . 
  during the 20th century , that 's what the language was officially called , so its a term still in use . 
  linguists are n't in the business of telling people what to call things and what not to call things , they 're in the business of figuring out how language works . 
  a linguist telling people that this way is the right way to say things and this way is the wrong way to say things would be like a biologist saying bats should n't be allowed to fly because they 're mammals and not birds . 
  it totally is a british colonization thing - they exported their victorian values , along with their railroads and their weird sports . 
  look no further than malaysia vs. indonesia - both muslim countries in the same cultural sphere , but in malaysia , same-sex sexual relations are totally illegal ( as is oral sex ) , and these laws are actually enforced at times ( ask anwar ibrahim ) . 
  indonesia , though ? 
  same-sex sexual relations are totally legal , and when they tried to pass a law making them illegal , it was shot down handily . 
  not saying that indonesia is any kind of paradise for lgbt people , but it 's a lot better than malaysia . 
  hell , even singapore still has laws on the books against same-sex sexual relations . 
  old colonial habits die hard . 
  they 're pushing for it , though . 
  [ just had a rally a few days ago ] ( http://www.voanews.com/content/hundreds-turn-out-to-support-same-sex-marriage-in-vietnam/1777892.html ) . 
  is n't the first one romansh ? 
  the real question is , where 's the * french * ? 
  i like thinking of that as getting more and more seroius : no - no - * no * - ** non ** - *** nein *** !, 
  and do n't forget the pitch accent . 
  yeah , my favorite part about this whole debate is that all 3 ( 4 ? ), 
  language standards are based off one dialect ( shtokavian ) , yet there also exist other dialects of the language ( like kajkavian , chakavian , and torlakian ) that are quite distant from shtokavian . 
  bullshit , linguists do n't call it nothing - they want no part in these inane political discussions . 
  in all seriousness , real , actual linguists never weigh in on the whole `` language or dialect '' thing , because said questions are actually not scientifically answerable - we do n't have any concrete definitions of what constitutes a `` dialect '' or a `` language '' ( when we want to be politically neutral , we just go with the generic `` variety '' ) . 
  now 's about the time for this well-worn ( but appropriately worn ! ), 
  quote from max weinreich :  \u05d0\u05b7 \u05e9\u05e4\u05bc\u05e8\u05d0\u05b7\u05da \u05d0\u05d9\u05d6 \u05d0\u05b7 \u05d3\u05d9\u05d0\u05b7\u05dc\u05e2\u05e7\u05d8 \u05de\u05d9\u05d8 \u05d0\u05b7\u05df \u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05df \u05e4\u05bf\u05dc\u05d0\u05b8\u05d8  `` a language is a dialect with an army and a navy '' `` but , but , but , '' you might say , `` what about mutual intelligibility ? 
  if two people can understand each other , should n't we just consider them to be speaking the same language ? '', 
  well , smart guy , how would you explain situations like portuguese and spanish , where portuguese speakers can often understand spanish speakers better than the other way around ? 
  or , for extra credit points , how would you describe the varieties of the inuit languages , where people in alaska can understand people in the yukon territory , and people in the yukon territory can understand people in the northwest territories , and people in the nw territories can understand people in nunavut , and people in nunavut can understand people in greenland , but people in greenland * ca n't * understand people in alaska !, 
  where would you draw the lines between language and dialect there , hmm ? 
  so , all these kinds of crazy situations mean the `` language/dialect '' question is pretty much an impossible one to answer scientifically . 
  so linguists do n't weigh in on what 's a language and what 's a dialect , and just go back to studying them to figure out how they work and leave that question up to the political firebrands .

  but ... how do you know which one is bosnian and which one is croatian ... ? 
  most likely not , but it 's probably a stylistic choice . 
  outside of ireland , generally in north america ( and apparently australia ) , `` gaelic '' is occasionally used to refer to the irish language ( and rarely , to scottish gaelic ) . 
  but because the irish themselves generally prefer the name `` irish '' for the language , nearly anybody with more than a passing interest in the language refers to it as `` irish '' . 
  as far as it being the name of a language family , it 's occasionally used that way by linguists , but the more common term is `` goidelic languages '' ( which include the modern languages of irish , scottish gaelic , and manx ) .

  um , he 's jamaican-british-estonian , i believe . 
  * reparations, 
  why in god 's name would they want to do that ? 
  [ fire shoots out of the god damn ground there ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yanar_dag ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , i agree , i just was referring to * him * running , not any foreign-born person . 
  and while this does n't excuse the requirement , it should be noted that the office of president does happen to be the only office that has the requirement in the us . 
  also , i feel that if any viable foreign-born candidate came up , they 'd probably repeal it pretty quick . 
  as far as why i would n't want arnie to run , as opposed to him running and me not voting for him , it 's because in our american system , it 's always the choice between two candidates , and , to paraphrase david sedaris , i want a choice between the chicken or the fish , not a choice between the chicken and the piece of shit with bits of broken glass in it . 
  and china itself is doing that , now , outsourcing to ( or rather importing labor from ) the provinces . 
  as a californian , please no . 
  please , please no . 
  once was enough for me , thanks . 
  i love arnie , he seems like such a nice dude , his movies are a lot of fun , but let 's just say he was n't the best of governors . 
  californian here - correct ( although it 's specifically property taxes , and it 's not in our constitution . 
  it 's called ` proposition 13 ' ) . 
  we 've * finally * been able to balance our budget ( running at a huge surplus , woo ! ), 
  because of two things - we have a democrat supermajority in our state assembly and state senate ( lower and upper houses ) , meaning obstructionist republicans ca n't block tax increases , and governor jerry brown pushed through some tax increases through the proposition system . 
  yes , that means californians voted to increase taxes on themselves , which in my mind was a very mature thing to do and a giant `` fuck you '' to the republican platform . 
  yes , but , you know ... * white * . 
  sure thing , guys . 
  admittedly , my phone is from a taiwanese company , but the os was developed by an american one !, 
  dear europeans , thank you for doing this . 
  because of this , i have n't had to buy new accessories for my new phones for ages . 
  sincerely , an american, 
  damn , really ? 
  the first i heard of him being all crazy was when he said that nasty stuff about gay people recently . 
  what other crazy stuff has he said ? 
  it 's a shame , i grew up really respecting the guy because of his work with solidarity . 
  seriously , has he gone mad or something ? 
  i mean , it 's only been recently that he 's been saying all this crazy stuff , right ? 
  not really . 
  while both cities do have a similar percentage of foreign-born people ( ~ 36 % ) , consider that london is approximately 60 % white , and 45 % white british . 
  in other words , 45 % of all londoners come from one ethnic group . 
  compare new york city - while white people still make up the plurality ( largest single racial group ) , they only make up 45 % of the population , and the largest single reported ethnicity is italian , who only make up 8 % of the total new york population . 
  so in other words , there is n't a single ethnicity that comes even * close * to dominating new york city . 
  as i said before , most europeans do n't really have any idea quite how diverse cities in the americas are . 
  new york city is not unique in the americas , while it 's certainly the most diverse overall , cities like toronto , san francisco , los angeles , and sao paulo have similar ethnic profiles , and while i have n't looked up the data for them yet , i highly doubt they would have any one ethnic group that would make up 45 % of the population . 
  i think it 's quite funny that many europeans talk , in both the positive and the negative , about how diverse european cities are and are getting . 
  there 's always talk of either `` they 're taking over !, 
  they 're taking over ! '', 
  or `` look at the amazing rainbow of cultures there are in my city !, 
  '' , when cities in the americas are * orders of magnitude * more diverse than any european city .
