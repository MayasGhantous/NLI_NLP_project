her face looks sort of downs though downvoted for not thinking a girl is pretty . 
  why i love reddit ... 
  how did you know or did you cheat ? 
  obviously not, 
  i was going through thinking what the fuck that looks nothing like alabama . 
  then i clicked back ohhhh i 'm on / r/europe, 
  why is it never beautiful women, 
  \ubd89\uc740\ubcc4 best operating system in world . 
  at least you have one . 
  i live in cincinnati , a metro area of 2 million people ( the 28th largest in the us ) . 
  our economy size is 119 billion gdp . 
  that 's about the same as milan italy or athens greece . 
  the closest thing we have to a railway is our train tracks ... we are building just a streetcar in downtown cincinnati and even that little thing is facing huge opposition because of `` costs '' we even got a bunch of money from the federal government for it and we 're still bitching . 
  calm down , george bush . 
  first of all i dont even think ive seen one movie or show making fun of gypsies in the us besides the british movie borat i do vaguely remember the sherlock holmes movie where he finds a gypsie girl but i dont think i remember anything racist anyways i dont see how you think theyre everywhere in us media . 
  hardly anyone in the us even knows who they are . 
  the us does n't have the social stigma against roma so its not even racist to have a roma guy doing black magic or whatever because in the us most people do n't even know what a roma is . 
  its sort of like in netherlands they have zwarte piet where people dress in black face as santa 's helper . 
  in the us this would be totally racist but in netherlands they do n't have the history we do with black face so its not racist there . 
  anyways it sounds like you 're trying to make this a competition and say that the us is more racist than europe towards roma which makes me laugh . 
  half of prisoners here are black while they 're only 10 % of the population . 
  would you then say its okay to be racist towards them because the stigma comes from important reasons ? 
  do n't be ridiculous, 
  in america literally no one hates roma though . 
  90 % of americans wo n't know what a roma is until you tell them gypsies and then they would say `` oh like from borrat or the holocaust ? 
  i learned what a roma was from this subreddit about a year ago . 
  i do n't know where you 're going at , are you trying to say americans are more racist towards roma than europeans ? 
  whenever i see a post about roma or young arabs doing something illegal there are always quite a few racist posts that get upvoted . 
  daaamn at the rate czech republic was growing , their gdp per capita would have been as high as the us by now if 2008 had n't happened . 
  got ta say our state capitol buildings are my favorite and i especially love their rounded roof type designs . 
  i ca n't pick one so i 'll show a few that i like the most : * [ minnesota ] ( http://img860.imageshack.us/img860/4862/minnesotastatecapitol02.jpg ) * [ connecticut ] ( http://commons.trincoll.edu/policyvoice/files/2011/03/cfiles25066.jpg ) * [ idaho ] ( http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4041/4389958675_7ca0eca64f_b.jpg ) * [ missouri ] ( http://tomforst.com/statecaps/missouri/mo11165.jpg ) * [ california ] ( http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1254/5124211372_a7d5a196f2_b.jpg ) as for my favorite building in europe it would be [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rbj5ysd.jpg ) house in poland, 
  maybe he already started doing this guys suggestion : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2kxkvu/i_have_nowhere_to_go_for_holidays_in_norther/clpmusj, 
  eurostat , the statistical office of the european union , defines unemployed as those persons age 15 to 74 who are not working , have looked for work in the last four weeks , and ready to start work within two weeks , which conform to ilo standards . 
  both the actual count and rate of unemployment are reported . 
  u3 ( official ) us unemployment rate : people are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job , have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks , and are currently available for work . 
  both use the exact same exact formula to show the unemployment rate . 
  the us also has 5 other types of unemployment that are used , but u3 is the standard one shown . 
  sept. 2014 : * u-1 persons unemployed 15 weeks or longer , as a percent of the civilian labor force - 2.8 % * u-2 job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs , as a percent of the civilian labor force - 2.9 % * u-3 total unemployed , as a percent of the civilian labor force ( official unemployment rate ) - 5.9 % * u-4 total unemployed ** plus discouraged workers ** , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers - 6.4 % * u-5 total unemployed , plus discouraged workers , ** plus all other persons marginally attached to the labor force ** , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force - 7.3 % * u-6 total unemployed , plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force , ** plus total employed part time for economic reasons ** , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force - 11.8 %, 
  but you did n't compare the euro area total employed person chart . 
  you compared the us to the lowest unemployment country in the eu ... and then you did n't even mention people dropping out of the labor force in the euro zone to specifically make the us look worse than europe . 
  did you just call a little girl a slut ? 
   meet bonnie if you insist . . 
  well yeah i 've been on a toll road a couple times before , but to think being charged a few dollars every 20 kilometers !!!!, 
  would be insane and cost more than gas prices, 
  will this impact tourism at all ? 
  that 's a joke right ? 
  they charge money to drive on the road ?

  its probably the only instance where canadians are more violent than americans . 
  do n't mess with their hockey . 
  it does n't matter who recognizes it . 
  if the us took over canada and made their provinces into states as much as i would disagree with doing that and if no country in the world recognized it , canada would now be part of the us and no one could do anything about it . 
  the only exception i 'd give is if the citizens are fighting against you . 
  for instance isis fighting against the kurds . 
  if isis took over a major area and are being fought against by them still i would count them as just occupying the territory . 
  but in the case of crimea no one is fighting back even . . 
  they will well maybe 50 of these at most to people who have pilot licenses . 
  meanwhile tesla will sell millions in the future . 
  when a country invades and annexes territory from another country , that territory is now part of that country . 
  that 's how countries are formed and how countries have always been formed . 
  just because you do n't like it does n't make it not true . 
  yeah definitely . 
  when i lived near los angeles i saw lots of middle eastern people but once i moved out here to ohio i 've seen one middle eastern person in the last few years . 
  yeah , just one and she was walking down the street wearing a hijab in the middle of my city i was like what the fuck is happening am i sleeping ? 
  edit just checked : http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/27/most-and-least-muslim-states_n_1626144.html there are 290 muslims per 100,000 people in ohio . 
  there are 11.57 million people in ohio so that means 33,553 muslims are here . 
  since they are located mostly in the middle of cities and i live in a suburb it 's hard to imagine even one lives here , but i bet if you go to the middle of downtown cincinnati or something you 'd see a few and be like omg they 're taking over the country !!, 
  now imagine in illinois with 2,800 muslims per 100,000 people . 
  the state with the most . 
  illinois has 12.88 million people . 
  that 's 338,464 muslims in illinois whos population is little over my state which has only 33,553 muslims . 
  then go to the middle of a major city in illinois like chicago and i 'd bet you 'd see a crazy amount of them even though they 're less than 1 % of the us population . 
   cheaper than the uk but are n't wages smaller too ? 
  as in people make so little money that the fact that it 's cheaper does n't matter ? 
   you live in a shit country i 'm glad you think that , hopefully you never come here . 
  i really want to save the immigration for people that deserve it like eastern europeans who would have been oppressed in your country, 
  i should have also added nerds to the list then so your evil oppressive country does n't do anything to them . 
  i 'm surprised china has so few people in the poorest decile of the world . 
  when i think of equal societies i do n't think of china . 
  in my online experience , they 're much nicer than british people . 
  not always calling us stupid and fat and saying our healthcare is shit and their country is a better place to live . 
  overall i like irish people much more than british . 
  iceland was very wealthy but now are just wealthy . 
  so the drop was large but they 're still doing alright . 
  what are they all going to do ? 
  trade their oil to each other ? 
  we tried to buy greenland but you refused, 
  why would you do that ? 
  she probably requested rt to pixelate them as she did n't know she 'd be on the news . 
   every man can simply walk around naked showing his genitals what society do you live in ? 
  it makes me want to actually ban women being topless in public . 
  more of these protests near me please . 
  too bad it 's already legal in my state :(, 
  my aunt lives in hawaii and fuck their gasoline prices so bad . 
  everything there costs like double what it costs here in ohio . 
  and its so hot and humid there that i want to die . 
  they would if they were able to, 
  how is that racist ? 
  that 's just trying to give your political party an advantage . 
  i was replying to the zephyy guy who said we only have a million of them and i was agreeing and saying yeah we have so few that we do n't even have names for them and people do n't even treat them differently because they 're not any different here .
