  so soooorry sorryyyy maple syrup sorry moose sorryyyyyy, 
  love me some simon and garfunkel, 
  besides our major cities like la or nyc no one here cares about fashion . 
  i regularly go shopping with sweat pants and house slippers and a plain $ 5 shirt . 
  no one cares . 
  americans font spend money on fashion either its a waste of fucking money . 
  think that 's why clothes are cheap here . 
  i can buy blue jeans for $ 20 i hear they 're expensive in europe, 
  probably feminists, 
  to be honest though ... cake by cake sounds like the best way to die . 
  its 33 % in the us . 
  lol i remember seeing during the olympics british people would make fun of americans being fat saying they accept fat american tourists . 
  meanwhile uk is only 5 % behind ... 
  seems most of europe is n't far behind . 
  is it really acceptable to make fun of a country when your countries obesity rate is just slightly under ? 
  that 's like an obese person making fun of a slightly more obese person for being fat, 
  on every video with an american i always see some german guy saying `` oh my gosh americans are so uncultured '' maybe you are the one ignorant to our culture and you do n't even know it . 
  this stamp looks retarded, 
  i 'm sure the numbers would drop a lot if you say `` positive to non-europe immigration '' instead of `` non-eu '' as having immigrants from norway/iceland/switzerland does n't seem so bad . 
  and how long after nato bombed yugoslavia did the 10 + year wars end ? 
  south korea , japan , yugoslavia , nazi germany , kuwait, 
   having a poor russian population mine the resources and sell them for what to them is an incredible sum of money is literally the ideal circumstance . 
  nonono we kill their population , then mine it with machines , like we did with the native americans . 
  this way you do n't have to feed them . 
  what about the minister of cool, 
  i agree with her statement . 
  as asians are the majority in the world , us white people are ethnic minorities and ca n't be racist . 
  also men are the minority because women live longer thus there are more of them , so as minorities , men ca n't be sexist against women . 
  bahar mustafa needs to check her privilege, 
   spying on the german public against their consent it was with the consent of the german government . 
  but of course stupid germans blame america for everything in their lives they do n't like . 
  they 're brainwashed . 
  does n't he realize telling a different country to do something will make said country not want to do something ? 
  looks like a yacht, 
  do you even know how the world works ? 
   majority of the drone victims are innocent what ? 
  lol . 
  not even close, 
  i assume you 'd like to go back in time to wwii and instead of going to war , give every soldier a trial !!!, 
  no more wars at all , just trials for everyone !!, 
  you guys start being able to buy junk food for the same price as we do here , with our higher median incomes and not be fat . 
  yesterday i just got 4 cheesy bean and rice burritos from taco bell for $ 4 . 
  that 's enough calories for a whole day for less than half my states ( ohio 's $ 8.10 ) minimum hourly wage . 
  christmas vacation always reminded me of a very normal american movie . 
  the only difference is not everyone 's as crazy . 
  depends on the post really . 
  if its about the nsa or something we get like -30 easy for saying anything . 
  i still choose to not wear my american flair . 
  ah i have a good one but i would get banned for saying it, 
  is n't it illegal to say this in germany, 
  ah i did n't know we were speaking spanish . 
  ` murican ones do . 
  we got a billion dollar one being built in london , a 700 million dollar one in iraq , a 500 million dollar one in mexico etc. . . 
  i 'd rather our money being spent on stuff like this which makes our relations with other countries better . 
  also we have 320 + million citizens and a lot of tourists . 
  we need big embassies anyway to be able to handle all of the logistics . 
  ahh americans get yelled at for saying they 're european for example `` kiss me , i 'm irish '' but once its a famous american they automatically become european !, 
  hdi , gdp per capita , gdp ( ppp ) per capita , house size , house prices , lack of taxes , lack of taxes after including health insurance , food portions , cheapness of food , overall happiness , average temperature , cheapness of electronics , average salaries , median salaries , cheapness of gas prices , spread of culture , and movies/television/video games industries are all bigger and better in the usa than the average european country . 
  you seem to be thinking of the americas , not america , maybe you should brush up on your geography . 
  my question was vague enough to not be considered loaded . 
  notice a common theme in our riots where everything gets burned down ? 
  i remember when nsa spying was released / r/europe wanted to kill americans they haded them so much . 
  now it seems most countries in europe were part of it . 
  hahaha, 
  next the north carolinians will claim neil armstrong was n't ohioan because he visited north carolina one time . 
  mexico also passed us in obesity . 
  you better start eating, 
   i wo n't be able to afford a car bro spend a few grand and buy a cheap car . 
  gas here is cheap and you 'll need a car . 
  as with most things though step 1 : be attractive step 2 : do n't be unattractive, 
  i 'd argue they 're way more important . 
  for example i live in ohio . 
  a state no one knows about . 
  we have 11.5 million people and a 600 billion dollar economy . 
  lots of cool stuff was invented here and i even live 30 minutes away from dayton where the airplane was invented . 
  yet ohio is very insignificant and hardly anyone 's heard of it . 
  $ 2.38 here in cincinnati . 
  costs me $ 20 to fill up my impala it was down to $ 1.80 like 5 months ago but sadly it went up a bit . 
  its been hovering at this price for a while now . 
  what are the people of your countrys thoughts on gay marriage ? 
  and freedom of religion ? 
  what about atheism ? 
  most do n't . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_internet_users only about half of people in romania do . 
  internet speeds around the us have really been taking off lately . 
  in my city they introduced gigabit internet and my current television provider gave us 30megabit internet and a phone line for the same exact price we were paying for our cable tv only . 
  i was thinking of switching to the gigabit because its only $ 60 a month , but i 'd rather have slow 30 megabit for free . 
  cops do n't have guns . 
  easiest video game ever . 
  what soul do have are a very particular set of skills, 
  is that from the shitty george of the jungle movie ? 
  stupid migrant birds taking our worms . 
  why not color the rows of seats yellow and make the white background blue so it looks like the eu flag ? 
   black siemens, 
  did you send it in time ? 
  every religion that i know of has extremist aspects . 
  be it anti-gay ( which is anti-freedom/equality/human rights ) or discriminates against women or other things like that . 
  so yes , i believe religion demands extremist behavior and are mostly plain evil . 
   ** regardless of ** their race , ethnicity , orientation , or ** religion **  ** do not have ** communist , nazi or other ** extremist past ** pick one . 
  and they had so many small things that happened in their country .
