  for comparison sake ** usa : ** 2014 : 54,596.653 2020 : 67,697.197 ** canada : ** 2014 : 44,843.442 2020 : 52,926.682 ** japan : ** 2014 : 37,389.785 2020 : 44,405.523 ** australia : ** 2014 : 46,433.299 2020 : 57,088.686 ** south korea : ** 2014 : 35,277.347 2020 : 47,134.483 ** china : ** 2014 : 12,879.853 2020 : 20,003.577, 
  maybe my family is just more racist than yours . 
  i 'm in ohio but grew up in california . 
  ah that 's sort of how it is here in the us . 
  between me and my family i hear lots of n words dropped , but never in public . 
  especially my grandpa talking about how blacks have over 50 % of the homicides in the us even though they 're just over 10 % of the population . 
   americans still lying in their school books about the necessity of the bomb drops on nagasaki and hiroshima , despite knowing japan wanted to surrender ? 
  what ? 
  did they not bathe in water ? 
  ah yeah many hours were spent watching a bunch of hammerdins hammer all day and watching my characters level up during uber trists . 
  they 're the reason southern europe is still in recession . 
  depression in greece 's case, 
  played that game for a good 7 years when i was a little kid, 
  he can be impeached by the house of representatives and the senate though . 
  then after that he can be arrested . 
  they will now only be known as surrender-allies, 
  luckily the english are n't well known for their food , so we do n't have to rename much . 
  toilet paper : use on your ass paper towels : keep in kitchen use while eating food/to clean up spills on the counter, 
  nyc is also the rudest city in the us . 
  i do n't know why europeans always go to nyc . 
  there 's so much better cities that are less expensive , are friendlier , are less compact and crowded , are n't as gross and smelly etc. . . why not visit ones like boston its next to nyc , or how about some nice southern cities like raleigh north carolina , nashville tennessee , austin texas , or tampa florida ( yeah lots of people visit miami but their beaches do n't even compare ) . 
  what about midwest cities too , people never remember those . 
  columbus ohio , minneapolis minnesota , milwaukee wisconsin , indianapolis indiana . 
  all amazing cities . 
  do n't forget mountain cities like salt lake city utah , or denver colorado . 
  also western cities like portland oregon , san francisco california , seattle washington , or wayyyy western honolulu hawaii . 
  why do europeans only visit shit cities like l.a. or nyc . 
  by the way i 'm not biased here i used to live near los angeles and now in cincinnati ohio . 
  do n't visit cincinnati though unless you go to mason or other suburbs . 
  right around downtown is shit . 
  anyways i 'm just ranting while laying down trying to sleep . 
  whatever, 
  wow spain pays well for how poor they are, 
  and lots of sugar . 
  in fact it will taste more like a juice that 's tea flavored, 
  on the 27th if our q4 gdp growth is revised upwards we could pass them ( currently 2.4 % for 2014 i believe ), 
  eh blonde is so 90s though . 
  it 's like the pornstar look today in my opinion especially bleach blonde . 
  haha they 're good . 
  they see the us economy growing so they need something to blame it on . 
  ask anyone in my city what they think of obama and you 'll think he 's the most evil person on earth . 
  i think they would say nicer things about putin, 
  dog pills, 
  so if you lose both world wars you get double positives ? 
  yeah he 's been gone for like 10 days only . 
  to put an entire documentary together would n't that take longer ? 
  yeah most icelanders live in the same metro area so it 's easy to travel to the protest . 
  the largest metro area in the us is nyc ny/newark nj at 19.95 million people . 
  that would be 698,250 people at 3.5 % i 'm sure a few hundred thousand more people would show up though as nyc is pretty close to boston/philadelphia/baltimore / d.c. / providence, 
  why does everything have to be about gays you russians seem to obsess over it . 
  you know gay people make up a very small percent of the population right ? 
  the last time i even heard a comment about anything related to gays ( not online ) was earlier this year i heard someone mention florida legalized gay marriage . 
  seriously you guys obsess over it so much , maybe if you did n't you wouldnt feel so hateful towards it . 
  gay people have zero impact in my life at all so why care ? 
  i 'm not in favor of china and india dictating the worlds policies . 
  google earth, 
  3 of them inherited the money when their billionaire family member died in 2014 though . 
  good on that one german guy though, 
  i think its bullshit though . 
  i was able to make a high speed rail line in my region ( great lakes ) and have it connect over 40 million people while having the same amount of rail as spain . 
  http://i.imgur.com/w27s3eq.jpg its also small enough to fit in spain so its not like some crazy distances or anything . 
  really though mexico is probably the country that we benefit the most from in the world . 
  we have like 20 to 30 million americans who are mexican and like half of them are recent immigrants . 
  they keep our population from turning into japan or german numbers . 
  they also assimilate pretty well , there wo n't be any mexican race riots or lotting any time soon . 
  there is a little tension whenever anti immigration laws are passed though but not a big problem . 
  my sister married a mexican and we joke that he 's whiter than me . 
  he ca n't even speak spanish lol and he 's a big computer geek . 
  go down to miami and half the people will be from latin america . 
  lots of spanish down in florida . 
  that names pretty kickass, 
  it 's europes florida . 
  its sunny , and cheap because its in the south and southerners are poorer than northeners . 
  there 's lots of tourism and people who speak spanish . 
  i 've never even heard of utrecht, 
  big high school . 
  mine was 2200 and still was pretty big, 
  they could blame the ukrainian conflict on putin and say they did n't want it , as a way to save face . 
  then pull out of ukraine , have sanctions lifted , and proceed to prosperity . 
  who am i kidding, 
  europe , backwards land where men shave their armpits but women do n't . 
  here if you shave your pits people will think you 're gay . 
  personally to me it just feels okay . 
  i prefer my penis inly to be sucked . 
  i usually tell the girl she does n't need to suck the balls if she does n't want to . 
  brazil - 200 million people portuguese do n't need to learn a different language . 
  ** i know a place you would love to move to . 
  ** i can show you the world , shining shimmering splendid . 
  tell me paravin now when did you last eat a tasty burger with fries ? 
  it goes straight to your thighs . 
  tasty , wonderful blubber . 
  whip cream , syrup , and butter on a crispy apple pie . 
  a whole new wooooooooooooooooorld chicken fried steak and mountain dewwwww eat a blueberry eggo , fast food burrito oreos , but just the filling . 
  we also have a $ 192 billion trade deficit . 
  if that deficit was all from europe ( it 's mostly not ) , that would save our economy 43 billion dollars with the 22.4 % drop . 
  if we were a net exporter , it would suck . 
  but out economy is mostly services and internal trade . 
  high currency value hurts us much less than it would europe,
