  and then that brought me to thinking about how many people are treated differently in europe while in the us they would n't be treated differently so i decided to make a post saying if anyone has tried living in western europe and has had problems like that , they should try the us instead where they would n't be treated negatively for things like being eastern european or having read hair , or being a roma just saying they would probably be more welcomed here . 
  and then this guy says that im saying that romas are criminals because europeans treat them badly but i do n't think so , i think that european romas are criminals because there are enough of them to form their own groups and social circles that they do n't have the need to integrate where as in the us there are so few that they 're forced to integrate or else be outcasts with no one to be friends with or loved by . 
  people just like putting words into other peoples mouths and downvoting them like what happened with me . 
  no i was talking about the us counting early deaths as deaths while europe counts early deaths as the baby never having been alive in the first place . 
  i do n't think they 're even called roma or even have a name here , people do n't even know what roma means . 
  seriously any eastern europeans that have trouble fitting in , in western europe , if you come to the us instead and no one will give a shit where you are from and will even think it 's pretty cool no matter how poor the country be it moldova or bulgaria . 
  also if you have red hair no one will care or make fun of you like i hear stories about in the uk . 
  we have no stereotypes about any eastern european be it how you look or act , you will just be thought of as european . 
  at most maybe someone will make fun of your accent but that 's at most . 
  i remember reading something that the us takes an extra step to try to save babies who will die compared to europe who does n't even count the babies as having been alive so it artificially makes the us infant mortality rate look much worse than europe . 
  could that play a role in the lower us life expectancy because of the fudged infant mortality statistics ? 
  thank you, 
   engelistan my god , this subreddit was right !, 
  can you do me please,

  they are , i do n't know this guys problem . 
  i pay about $ 100 a month for my insurance and i 'm 21 . 
  for my car payment well , i 've never had payments on a car before just always bought them outright so i have no clue how much typical payments are . 
  if this guy is really worried about his budget so bad why not just get rid of the car and buy an older car from like 2000 for like $ 1000 and not have payments again, 
  i 'm offended that you 're offended that he does n't understand why it 's offensive . 
  poland is doing very well for a eastern european country . 
  i knew a polish kid in middle school , i wonder why they came here to the us if things are going so well over there . 
  yeah it would also curb sales from people who actually buy things too . 
  for instance downloading a 10gb game that you already bought on steam would cost you 153 forints per gb that 's 1530 forints or $ 6.35 just to download a game you bought . 
  delete it to make room on your hard drive and got ta download it again ? 
  $ 6.35 more . 
  bored of that game and want to play a different 10gb game ? 
  $ 6.35 more . 
  want to stream in 1080p on netflix ? 
  up 4.7 gb/hour and will cost you about $ 3 an hour to watch netflix . 
  wanted to watch 1080p streams all saturday for like 8 hours ? 
  $ 24 , thank you . 
  want to watch just 2 hours of 1080p tv shows online a day after you get back from work ? 
  that 's $ 180 a month . 
  think that 's a lot of money ? 
  now think about how much less the average hungarian makes than you and i. 
  the top one says jobaratok and google tells me that 's friends . 
  i 'm guessing it 's the entire show friends . 
  friends had 240 episodes and this shows each episode is 1080p bluray . 
  that comes to about 2gb per episode which seems about right since the episodes are n't compressed and are true 1080p . 
  each episode is about 22 minute long and movies are about 90 minutes and 90 minute movies are around 10gb in 1080p uncompressed so yeah sounds right . 
  which is why i asked where do they put them all say that 's a 24 % increase in population over a span of 4 years ( 2011-2015 ) that 's a 6 % increase in population each year . 
  here in the us the fastest growing state is north dakota with a 7.55 % increase from 2010 to 2013 so that 's 2.51 % population growth . 
  less than half of lebanon . 
  in north dakota they 're having trouble building enough housing for the population growth , so prices are skyrocketing and people have to live in buildings supplied by their work with hundreds of guys to a building . 
  now look at north dakotas gdp per capita of [ $ 80,428 in 2013 ] ( http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/compare_state_spending_2013bz0a ) and compare that to lebanon with around $ 10,000 gdp per capita they probably have a much harder time building housing . 
  so lebanon was able to build 25 % more houses ? 
  where do they put them all, 
  now we will see hungarian redditors start 2 spk lyk ths to try and save their data, 
  does anyone know what the number is for the us ? 
  i searched google but still ca n't find it . 
  i have a question . 
  is there an american equivalent to . eu ? 
  i might answer my own question by saying i see . gov a lot but is . gov american only or can other countries governments have . gov websites ? 
  if its not american only , than what 's the equivalent of . eu for americans ? 
  well i was talking more about people forcing kids to produce sex acts on camera so the pictures could be sold to pedos . 
  if you have less of a demand for that , than less kids would be molested . 
  i do n't think this would lower the rate of pedos molesting kids but i think each time a pedo jerks off to a fake kid that 's one less time he would have looked at a pic of a real kid and that 's a little less demand for kids to be molested for a profit . 
  i think drawings of child pornography should be encouraged as it causes the demand for actual children to go down while fake children become more common . 
  i would rather a pedophile have 500 pictures of fake children than 1 picture of a real child . 
  if anyone was wondering the us has about 1.1 or the same as netherlands with our 350 nobel laureates . 
  people are n't allowed to hate countries ? 
  what ??? 
  asking a question is the definition of adding to the conversation . 
  holy shit they 're second place in total number of golds behind the us and their population is only 330,000 . 
  they must be the master race when it comes to strongman genetics . 
  he was just asking a question and then you come and say irrelevant . 
  one word without even adding anything at all . 
  your post was literally irrelevant , while his actually added to the conversation . 
  it 's the whole point of reddit . 
  no it 's not , he was just asking a question . 
  your post though is in fact irrelevant . 
  im about to make a map to prove you wrong . 
  reminds me of the robosaurus i saw when i was little at a monster truck show . 
  found it : http://youtu.be/ed5xlbf1tme?t=2m26s, 
  charts from the pdf i threw together . 
  prices are way low near me . 
  just filled up my gas tank for $ 35, 
  we had help from the talibonfire, 
  america is # 1 again . 
  no one competes with our bonfire we had on september 11th 2001 suck it, 
  or maybe the industries killed themselves by not being as good as apple, 
  i know but i do n't really know if i 'd count a style of mexican food as american .

  no one in ireland can get gay married but in the us over 60 % of the population can in their home state , or they can go next door and get married and the federal government will recognize it . 
  get out of here you damn right wing irish !, 
  oh my god i was n't expecting to laugh so hard at your first picture, 
  i gave a crap and did n't drink until i was 21 . 
  18 year olds in the military ca n't accidentally kill me , why would i care ? 
  and the firearm thing is obviously a big debate but personally i like how the law is now where you can have shotguns or rifles at 18 but can only have handguns at 21 because those are more dangerous and concealable . 
  and i think the positives of being able to own a gun outweigh the negatives , but everyone here will obviously disagree with me there as it 's / r/europe . 
  21 is a good drinking age and in my opinion it should be higher . 
  thousands of people die every year because of teenagers drinking and driving and while not everyone follows the law , some of us do . 
  like myself the first full drink i had was when i turned 21 . 
  want a cushion for that butthurt ? 
  i feel like most those presidents fucked up other countries , but reagan fucked up the us, 
  poverty power parity,
