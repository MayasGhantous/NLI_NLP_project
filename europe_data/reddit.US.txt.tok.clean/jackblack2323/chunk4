   i am sorry but you want to also throw all those countries out ? 
  either that or pay a fine . 
  say germany is $ 10 billion under their 2 % budget . 
  make germany pay a nato fine of $ 10 billion which is distributed evenly to all members who meet their obligations as compensation , and also promotes countries to want to meet their 2 % obligation because they would be rewarded for it . 
  also it sounds like you 're trying to make excuses for germany as to why they 're allowed to break the rules while mooching off countries like the uk and greece like a beggar . 
  signing contracts and then not paying your bills ... is that the german way ? 
  looks like it is now . 
  because germany is in nato and should n't be rising their budget that much this year , it should already be at that level . 
  if they do n't want to have it in their budget , then leave nato , but do n't sit in nato and also complain about military spending . 
  this must be very old, 
  we have underground rail systems ?!?

  i wonder if there will be any countries threatening to deforest themselves if western countries do n't give them more aid . 
  i remember seeing a chart of how satisfied chinese tourists were after their vacations and i believe new zealand and australia were # 1 and # 2 and the us was # 3 at being most satisfied . 
  i think it 's mostly european cities where they had these problems . 
  yeah lol some places are worse than others . 
  i moved from orange county california though and the change is pretty noticeable . 
  to be honest i like it here where i can go shopping in a 5 dollar shirt , 10 dollar jeans and no one will care . 
   i did n't realize how sophisticated and self-conscious most french girls were until i went to the us where the dress code is more relaxed . 
  i noticed this about europe a lot too . 
  people there really care a lot about how they look and if their clothes are expensive or not . 
  in the us it depends where you are but where i am ( midwest ) most girls will wear something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l2fvj6y.jpg ) in public and be fine . 
  but in europe i saw everyone dressing really nice . 
  we also wear a lot of really cheep clothing compared to europe where most stuff is very expensive compared to when i 'm here . 
   138 million americans who want out . 
  loool ? 
  have it backwards . 
  the eu countries would be us states , not the other way around . 
  it 's funny listening to a non-american talk about how americans act . 
  new zealand , south korea , israel , philippines , japan , argentina , australia , china , canada , chile , iran , bahamas , and morocco . 
  no because i move from state to state . 
  i lived in california for 13 years then ohio for another 8 and now am going to move to nevada within a year or two . 
  it would n't be possible for me to do this if we split up . 
  ireland growing faster than china ? 
  i do n't know if i believe this right now . 
  well new mexico http://i.imgur.com/3hjd5bql.jpg and iowa http://i.imgur.com/7tgxqa4h.jpg are n't all countryside either . 
  wow tickets are expensive in europe . 
  here they 're about $ 6, 
  http://i.imgur.com/wto3soq.jpg its all a big conspiracy i tell you !, 
  i do n't know , probably a thousand at most . 
  if i had a restaurant that sold these we 'd have a commercial that went : \u266b chicken tikka and beef curry are the best you better hurry \u266b, 
  also i think it was in the jackass movie edit : ok since got downvoted i googled it , and it was in season 2 episode 7 of the jackass tv show . 
  congrats serbia you 're the real gold medalists . 
  be lucky you 're not team usa and expect a gold no matter what . 
  its very boring . 
  16 year old driving their first car . 
  probably only paid a couple hundred dollars for it . 
  nothing will ever compete with pasta and pizza . 
  nothing . 
  it means # 1 times 2 !!, 
  2 times better than # 1 , baby !!, 
  so like when europeans think all americans are cowboys with southern accents ? 
  same type of thing ? 
  want to see something crazier ? 
  zoom in on new york city, 
  drives around with russian and saudi arabian gasoline . 
  israeli electronic circuits ? 
  never in my life !!!, 
  i do n't think we need to ban support for is . 
  i 'm pretty sure there is none here . 
  seriously we have half as many muslims in the us compared to germany and we have over 4 times their total population . 
  0.8 % of americans are muslims compared to germany 's 5 %, 
  with an economy size over 20 times smaller than the us state of kansas , russia is sure to be brought to its knees from these mighty kosovo sanctions . 
  polish probably hate america the least in europe especially considering how much they hate russia right now, 
  i 've watched thousands of movies and have n't heard of it . 
  but but the us accidentally shot down a plane once years ago . 
  so now every country in the world is allowed to shoot planes out of the sky and if someone complained they will say `` but the evil us did it '' !, 
  b b and b b, 
  ok but now you guys are n't allowed to complain . 
  listen up sheeple , le amerikkka is le biased . 
  makes me even more proud to be an american with our 70 % + white ethnicity population and we have a black president . 
  imagine a black president in russia , wonder what those odds are . 
  probably the invention of the airplane . 
  eurostat , the statistical office of the european union , defines unemployed as those persons age 15 to 74 who are not working , have looked for work in the last four weeks , and ready to start work within two weeks , which conform to ilo standards . 
  both the actual count and rate of unemployment are reported . 
  u3 ( official ) us unemployment rate : people are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job , have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks , and are currently available for work . 
  both use the exact same exact formula to show the unemployment rate . 
  the us also has 5 other types of unemployment that are used , but u3 is the standard one shown . 
  * u-1 persons unemployed 15 weeks or longer , as a percent of the civilian labor force - 2.9 % * u-2 job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs , as a percent of the civilian labor force - 3.1 % * u-3 total unemployed , as a percent of the civilian labor force ( official unemployment rate ) - 6.1 % * u-4 total unemployed ** plus discouraged workers ** , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers - 6.5 % * u-5 total unemployed , plus discouraged workers , ** plus all other persons marginally attached to the labor force ** , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force - 7.3 % * u-6 total unemployed , plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force , ** plus total employed part time for economic reasons ** , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force - 12.1 %, 
  as i read this i literally heard the exact same line said in the movie 13 sins that i 'm watching while reading reddit comments . 
  wooooah, 
  turkey ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ lol, 
  ah i accidentally unchecked the box that says `` show my flair on this subreddit . 
  it looks like : '' was just laughing because the us and japan are randomly added to the end, 
  nooooooooo the eu has conquered us !!, 
  why did no one inform me !?!, 
  okay, 
  china # 4 wow chinas so clean and efficient !, 
  here 's one i saw on / r/mapporn the other day for the us : http://i.imgur.com/qdyjllx.jpg, 
  because their religion and skin color is different they 're all of a sudden not european citizens ? 
  a broken clock is right twice a day . 
  he was comparing his country to america , and your first guess of his country was america ... 
  germany is n't an ally , do n't kid yourself . 
  our only allies are the five eyes , and to a lesser extent south korea , philippines , and japan . 
  why do you think we have so many soldiers in germany ? 
  its not because we 're protecting them , that 's for damn sure . 
  china in the 1700 's probably, 
  no , that money probably left the economy to a country that produces the drugs and then it was seized before they could make their profits .
