  agreed man , we have much better allies in asia that ask for our help instead of telling us to fuck off while secretly asking us to stay like the europeans do . 
  japan , south korea , and the philippines are all our good allies and deserve our help more than europe . 
  we meet to pull out of nato immediately . 
  europe is a big boy they can take care of themselves . 
  i 'd rather we invade the sea than any other countries . 
  yeah it just pisses me off the immigrants from the uk/australia etc. . come here and fuck my country up even more . 
  i live in cincinnati and just a few miles away is the largest creation museum in the world : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/creation_museum and the president http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ken_ham is from australia, 
  unemployment rate is half a percent lower in the us than the uk : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate my guess why , would be the more conservative individuals would want to come to the us . 
  australians , canadians , and british always send their conservatives here and it pisses me off . 
  we need to pull all troops out of europe , and the middle east . 
  asia and north america is where our true allies are . 
  canada already has our protection though just by us being their only neighbor . 
  then we have japan , south korea , and the philippines who are our best allies and are all in close proximity so easier to help defend . 
  any other country can defend themselves and fuck off . 
  oh yeah western girls are going to eastern europe by the thousands ... lol, 
  the uk 's unemployment rate is one of the lowest in europe . 
  and no do n't go saying well people just stopped looking for jobs so its not counting them , because that 's true for every country , you ca n't just say that for the uk, 
  my god , we deport the equivalent of iceland every year . 
  is this seen as anti-russia or just pro-belarus ? 
  just say republican american . 
  there are many southern white americans who do n't think like that . 
  and no i 'm not a southern white american . 
  jennifer lawrence creates a reddit account to have sex with 1 random redditor and chooses to pm you . 
  yeah you 'd have to go into purchasing power in the country to see how it compares . 
  australia has a minimum wage of $ 16.88 us dollars , but look at purchasing power parity , and it drops down to around $ 10.20 . 
  here : http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=rmw is the list . 
  in the us each state has different purchasing power too though which i guess could happen in australia but i do n't know those . 
  here 's one for the us : http://www.missourieconomy.org/indicators/cost_of_living/index.stm i 'm lucky enough to live in ohio which is only 94 % of the average cost of living in the us , and our minimum wage is $ 7.95 an hour which is 70 cents over the us minimum wage or 109.6 % of it . 
  here it would need to be only $ 6.81 for us to have the same cost of living as the us federal at $ 7.25 , so we have over a dollar higher ( at $ 7.95 ) than we need to be average , yaaaay !, 
  it disadvantages some states though . 
  look at hawaii with cost of living 162.9 % of the us average , and their minimum wage of only $ 7.25 an hour . 
  their minimum wage would need to be $ 11.81 to have the same cost of living as ohio 's $ 6.81 requirement . 
  there are 2 minimum wages . 
  1 for all states $ 7.25 , and one that each state gives itself . 
  so states like alabama and mississippi that do n't have a minimum wage at all are forced to pay $ 7.25 an hour . 
  but states that raise their wages over $ 7.25 like washington ( $ 9.32 ) pay that . 
  some states that raise it over time add a little every year to keep from significant changes , like massachusetts is raising it a little every year until 2017 and then it will be $ 11 an hour , or california raising it to $ 13 an hour in 2017 . 
  i do n't know , obamas the only president i could actually see playing video games . 
  i know he likes watching tv shows like house of cards and homeland , he also said the wire was one of the best shows ever . 
  so with all the tv watching i can see him sitting down once in a while and playing video games . 
  i doubt the witcher is up his alley though , i 'd picture him playing more golf or nba 2k video games, 
  as someone who used to live in california , it 's not even close to the best state . 
  i also study many maps and statistics about states , so here 's my top states . 
  to anyone reading this , please visit these places when you come to the us , not just new york or california . 
  by the way it will offend every american because they all want to believe their state is the best , i 'm in ohio so no bias from me .

  yeah man , have these guys never played tony hawk before ??!, 
  you also have to put your name in a local newspaper . 
  yes . 
  us and europe should cut ties . 
  they should no longer be allies . 
  lithuisiana, 
  the government only has $ 12.312 trillion of the federal debt . 
  the public , and countries like japan , and china have bought around 5 trillion dollars of debt from the us government . 
  federal debt is irrelevant compared to public debt,
