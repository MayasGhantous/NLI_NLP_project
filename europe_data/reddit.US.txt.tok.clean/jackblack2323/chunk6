  yeah i meant to say times 7 but i had just woken up . 
  anyways , what i 'm going on about is this : there are 2 types of debt . 
  public debt = debt your government has for things like fixing roads and parks and paying the military 2 . 
  external debt = debt all of your businesses have from outside of the country . 
  you listed the us external debt which is indeed 17.3 trillion dollars . 
  so i listed the uk external debt which is 10 trillion dollars ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_external_debt ) . 
  then when you talk about the uk debt you go around and switch to government ( public ) debt instead of using the external debt like you used for the us so it makes the uk look better than the us when in reality it 's not . 
  now go to : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_public_debt and click the little up and down arrows next to `` public debt as % of gdp '' this will show the us public debt as 72.50 percent of the economy ( gdp ) while the uk public debt is 90.0 percent of the economy . 
  now start learning at least a little about how things work before talking shit about other countries . 
  i was going by external debt . 
  even in public debt , 10 times 2 trillion is 20 trillion which is higher than 17 trillion so the uk would have a higher percentage of debt compared to their economy . 
  the uk is $ 10 trillion in debt and their economy is about 7 times smaller than the us economy, 
  map i made that has to do with this : http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/28oeyo/states_if_they_were_countries_with_a_similar/, 
  all of that is complete bullshit, 
  * central and eastern i 'm not only talking about poland, 
  me too, 
  reading these comments makes me rethink our support for eastern europe . 
  we know of them but we do n't touch that shit . 
  no one will care , only hate the us more . 
  my god look at those locations . 
  good luck guys . 
  well i remember seeing a post like that with about 60 upvotes so more people agreed with it than disagreed, 
  i see it on / r/europe all the time . 
  muslim french guy rapes someone ? 
  everyone here will say `` french '' with the quotes like because that person was muslim they 're somehow not french even if they were born in france .

  dutch i do n't know what i expected . . 
  see it every day on reddit . 
  put the money in the bag and no one gets hurt !, 
  it makes sense that i ended up losing weight by not eating bread then . 
  i understand you , but i 'd like to be a smart-ass and say a withdrawl from food will kill you every time . 
   somebody else did i say it was somebody elses fault ? 
  if you give a drug addict an unlimited supply of cheap drugs what do you think he 's going to do with it ? 
  it would n't be someone elses fault , but i would n't blame the guy for not being able to work up the will power to stop . 
   also , the smoking analogy does n't quite work so well . 
  it 's not like there is some speacial section at the supermarket where i can buy healthy tobacco and i can start rolling myself some healthy cigarettes . 
  but you can do that with food . 
  you can buy some fresh healthy food , make it the way you like it , and develop a passion for something interesting and useful . 
  i 'm not talking about eating healthy , i 'm talking about overeating . 
  i actually lost 60 pounds or about 30 kilos by eating less and dieting , but dieting alone did n't work . 
  say i decided to eat a salad . 
  i would eat 2 bowls of it instead of 1 and if i only ate one i would need more , it would n't even be like `` oh i 'm not full yet so i want to eat more '' it 's more like `` if i eat more it 's going to make me feel better '' . 
  and it does make you feel better . 
  especially as someone with depression it 's hard to feel happy and i rarely do , but when i eat food that 's one of the few times that i actually feel good . 
  as a former obese man , overeating really is an addiction . 
  i weighed almost 140 kilos but since have shed some weight off after years of trying . 
  i know reddit likes to make fun of fat people and say things like `` why do n't you just stop eating so much , fatty ? '', 
  and say it 's their own fault for being fat . 
  in reality it 's just as hard to stop gaining weight as it is to quit smoking , or to stop a different addiction . 
  whenever i walk by something really fatty or sugary i still get the feeling in my brain that i have to eat that right now , if i eat that it would be the best feeling in the world . 
  it takes so much will power to tell myself not to eat that and eat something better that it 's not even a joke . 
  it 's really fucking hard to convince myself not to do that . 
  the hardest thing about overeating addiction is that you require food multiple times a day . 
  with cigarettes or anything else you can quit and never do it again , but imagine how hard quitting smoking would be if you required 3 cigarettes a day to live . 
  yeah i was talking about unemployment rate . 
  why was i down voted ? 
  nice job uk , you guys are going to catch up to us soon if you keep it up . 
  looking to be one of the fastest growing economies in western europe . 
  does anyone know how much supplies the us gave to the ussr and the allies ? 
  i know the ussr lost the most people fighting germany , but were n't many of them using us supplies ? 
  i see different types of contributions that ca n't be compared . 
  i really hope they become independent . 
  i feel like their politics will be more progressive than the current uk and having one more progressive country in this world is always a good thing . 
  jesus that 's a lot of people . 
  5200 in 3 days . 
  if that is kept up , there will be over 632,000 illegal immigrants coming a year to italy . 
  that 's higher than their population growth rate, 
  would probably say foreign-born ( kenya ) prisoners are n't allowed to come into the us, 
  they 'd make much more money being strippers in north dakota . 
  i saw some story those women are making $ 350,000 + a year . 
  does anyone know why not many people like south korea ? 
  every time i criticize something a country does here , i get down voted and like 5 people reply to me saying `` but america is way worse , you have no right to talk !!! '', 
  like for some reason i 'm only allowed to criticize my own country like i 'm the person making the decisions in america or something . 
  i say russia is n't nice for invading and annexing crimea and i always get `` but america something something iraq and afghanistan !!! '', 
  also spray paint, 
   reprehensible things in the same ballpark as russia wut when ? 
  no , it 's illegal . 
  he can , he said / s to show that it was a joke about how it looks like the circle is over russia , even though he knows it 's not russia but you did n't understand what he said . 
  then i replied to you not understanding his sarcasm with my own joke ( in relation to your original comment saying americans ca n't read maps ) calling you an icelander because finlands flag looks like icelands , but you seem to not understand this joke either . 
  nor does anyone else seem to , because i was downvoted . 
  shut the fuck up icelander , americans can tell the difference between countries just fine . 
  upvoted for not getting mad when given facts . 
  it would make sense using purchasing power because people have to build stadiums and such , but the cost of actual materials would n't make sense to use purchasing power . 
  i think it would be best to use a mixture of both . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) wrong , they 're about the same in terms of gdp . 
  both at about 500 billion usd . 
  but if you look at per person : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita norway is about 9 times wealthier . 
  ukraine and kazakhstan are too poor , china just hosted the olympics a few years ago in beijing , and now poland is out of the game . 
  looks like it goes to norway . 
  they 're also one of the richest countries in the world , very cold in the winter , and have lots of mountains . 
  perfect country for the winter olympics i think . 
  if norway decides to also withdraw like the people in this thread say might happen , the olympics is fucked . 
  i 'd rather see it go to beijing again than the other two , but then it will just be boring . 
  i do n't want to see the olympics in beijing again . 
  yeah if europeans pushed for no death penalty in america it might even make things worse here .
