  geez , 2 people having a fair and balanced conversation . 
  off with your heads . 
  yes and why not send them by lufthansa . 
  that way lufthansa has to return them all for free because they will all be denied asylum . 
  the last time i checked , germany was considered a stable country . 
  so you think countries will leave the eu before they accept a few thousand refugees ? 
  the vast vast majority of muslim immigrants in the united states are perfectly good people . 
  their children are true american citizen . 
  compared with the number of muslims in the us , the number radicalized is tiny why is it so different in the eu ? 
  or is it just perceived differently in the eu ? . 
  so , would your argument be that they already know more about our culture then they would of european culture when coming ? 
  m eh , it 's not so bad . 
  most groups integrate after the first generation . 
  is n't the vote technically illegal ? 
  everyone knows fluorine makes you socialist and pro-immigration . 
  that is some pretty impressive scaremongering, 
  i think world war 3 would start before that happened, 
  i was not responding to you . 
  you obviously just hate american influence in canada . 
  it is very intoxicating, 
  you hate to be influenced by us , why would the eu telling you what to do be any better ? 
  i 'm sorry to say but there is no chance that the us would ever join europe like that . 
  the whole revolutionary war would make it to thorny of an issue for us to unite with europe . 
  police are there to protect citizens and legal residents . 
  not be everyone 's bestest buddy . 
  just use the police to eject them . 
  europe was good at it before the crisis but now you just stopped . 
  even if they had not cashed it , the rental agreement is in perpetuity . 
  only we can cancel it and we dont love cuba . 
  except your the one talking about their histories . 
  i am specifically talking about the current federal governments . 
  the rest of spain is not just going to let catalonia go . 
  texas was an independent country . 
  it was only the people at the top like sam houston who wanted to join the us . 
  the texas flag is the flag of their republic . 
  the texas rangers were the republic of texas 's police force . 
  they still murmur all the time whenever the economy goes a little bad . 
  i more meant the chance of the central government giving in . 
  google talk censored me . 
  watch mother f ***** c ********* s *** biscuits, 
  i think they have as much chance at being a country as texas does . 
  p.s ? 
  that means 0 . 
  that is just f ***** up for some reason . 
  according to the chart , it is your reality :( unless that portugal , i have bad eyes . 
  we dont have high welfare but we get quite a few immigrants . 
  ~ 900,000 legally allowed in each year , ~ 800,000 get citizenship each year ( not the same people , usually people who have lived here for a while or were illegal and managed it ) . 
  i wonder how many are highly skilled and how many are not ? 
  to be fair , its amazing that the us military gave us so much use of what was essentially a military weapon that put us above everyone else . 
  do i count or am i to racist ? 
  bring a unit of bundeswehr with you and your golden . 
  nazis nazis nazis . . did i do it right ? 
  its embarrassing to the rest of the world to condemn spying when you help and spy as much . 
  sigh , the eu is silly . 
  order would be a good thing now . 
  it would probably ease some of the tensions, 
  this whole repeatedly closing down european infrastructure is crazy, 
  actually , they mean exactly what they say . 
  they just happen to be things we suck at . 
  you will notice politicians only say those after the invasion . 
  i make $ 1350 . 
  month as a grad student . 
  640 apartment 95 electricity 90 phone 100 car insurance 230 payment . 
  it all equals out, 
  i dont understand this . 
  the us gives around 2 months of help then cuts it all for refugees but people still come . 
  poland gives you everything and you run ? 
  yes , because i personally wrote that idiots speeches, 
  several were . 
  when dclauzel is on , alll these will aswell id bet, 
  this has been delisted 2 times already, 
  dehuminization is the rallying cry of the facist and murder . 
  how do you think balkans peoplez could kill each other , rwandans murder neighbors , and we ( the us ) drop the a bomb ? 
  because we were fighting trash . 
  i dont care if you dont agree with me but once you dehumanize someone , you have started on a slippery slope . 
  i dont even care if you say the people have no useful skills or reason to be in your country as long as you dont use dehumanizing terms like trash . 
  damnit dclauzel , your people need you . 
  you are not the mod we deserve but the mod we need . 
  did i do it right ? 
  * edit * i cant tell if i did the batman quote backwards ir not  . <, 
  to be fair , if mexico was in syrias position , we would gave stopped it along time agl . 
  deer jerky is amazing ... . deer burgers ... deer steak ... deer mmmmmm * drools * deer, 
  hypnotic . . 
  not ok to call people trash . 
  never dehumanize another person . 
  dehuminzation is the furthest step hate can take . 
  the used to just cut down a tree and throw it in the water . 
  hundreds of them would hold on to that tree . 
  not really , nothing is legal if there is no clear government with full territorial integrity . 
  europe produces more than rnough to feed itself , europe trades for variety, 
  if they cant compete , why does the government help them . 
  if we negotiate and he loses , syrians will never forgive us . 
  what ? 
  why ? 
  do you really think that if something drastic was happening to europe the military would not get control of it ? 
  well , nasa and esa both have their own rockets but they are more expensive than the russian ones . 
  nasa and to a lesser extent the esa are banking on private industry beating the russians . 
  its the equivalent of chinese manned space missions . 
  someone worked out all of the bugs so your first missions can go much faster and be more precise . 
  yep , it only has to bow to european militaries if something happens .
