there 's a difference between seeing a deleted comment with a downvote and a couple of generally snarky replies , rather than seeing a reply that says '' / u/recallrethuglicans did n't bother to read any context , and raised the same point that had already been discussed and shown to be contextually relevant . 
  for this , he was downvoted . '', 
  sure , either way , you 've deleted it and technically it 's not affecting your karma . 
  but it 's still going to open you up to potential replies or inbox hits about it that you 'd rather not deal with . 
  edit : and a difference between me editing it now to say `` ha i totally got the joke '' versus me editing it a minute from now and getting the *, 
  i 'm not saying it usually is . 
  but ars technica is using the same headline . 
  just highlighting the title and right clicking to search for it on google shows me that the ars article shows as 2 days ago . 
  3 days ago there 's a gizmodo article with the exact same title . 
  there 's also a guardian ( uk ) article on the same day with different words but the same semantically dubious meaning . 
  several links to reddit . 
  again , 3 days ago pc world , same headline . 
  computer world , too . 
  an article from another british magazine with the same british take on the title . 
  i 'm trying to find the ur example , but there are literally ** so ** many stories using the exact same wording ( or a slight variation of the wording with the same meaning ) that i ca n't . 
  if you read any of these , they all state that there is a very small number of articles that did n't just discuss the court 's order regarding the man bringing the suit , they discussed his crimes and punishment . 
  the exact content that google was told not to host . 
  so essentially these other places are forcing google to remove new content , rather than ( ostensibly ) old coverage . 
  that 's why google is fighting it . 
  they essentially consented to let articles time out . 
  that was their understanding of it . 
  that after a certain time , certain articles about certain qualifying people could be removed from their index . 
  this man put himself back in the news , in their opinion , by filing this suit . 
  so that 's the grounds of their defense ... that they 're not responsible for removing new coverage of a man involved in a new court case who happens to have old crimes . 
  ( or whatever it is that he 's claiming he needs to be forgotten for . 
  i 'm just assuming he 's a criminal . ), 
  if you run home after school and say `` you know mike , mom ? 
  he called the teacher a motherfucker and got suspended for three days ! '', 
  that 's not the same as saying `` a kid at school got in trouble today . '', 
  one lists the name , the crime , and the punishment . 
  the other gives a general idea of the * content * without personally identifying information . 
  i 've seen this same headline repeated several times . 
  it 's blatant clickbait . 
  google is being asked to remove links to stories ** about the links they 've removed ** rather than about removing links generally . 
  it 's like the eu is salty that icann is n't transferring fast enough , so they just want to break the thing . 
  as an american i feel we owe a particular debt to france , who helped us in our war for independence ... while we stood on the sidelines and refused to aid their own revolution . 
  that was a dick move . 
  but still , france had no hard feelings . 
  they sent that nifty statue anyway . 
  if you need anything , hit me up . 
  the judge 's hands are tied by german laws regarding sentencing minors . 
  they have [ already been rescued ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/russian-scientists-trapped-arctic-polar-bears-month-wait-rescue ) . 
  a ship dropped off some supplies which they were able to use to drive the bears off . 
  i 'm not sure the eu would be able to establish any sort of jurisdiction . 
  and without that there 's no way to impel cooperation , which means all the eu could do is spend a lot of money to repeat what the previous reports have already said . 
  see , the way you 're thinking , that 's the idea that politics is out of reach for young people . 
  why bother because there 's nothing to be done . 
  and it 's absolute bollocks . 
  [ overall turnout ] ( http://www.fairvote.org/2016_presidential_primary_voter_turnout_analysis_to_date ) for the primaries was 30.14 % . 
  new york had less than 20 % of voter eligible people turn out . 
  let 's look at texas . 
  1.4 million people [ voted in the democratic primary ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uayhhrfd-4iqrha52ngmvgomrqq5lqrx3oihl109ea0/edit#gid=521766165 ) . 
  936,000 for hillary , 476,000 for sanders . 
  one way to look at that is he lost by `` a lot '' . 
  young people made up 21 % of the people bothering to vote , not the percentage who * could * . 
  if 21 % of * eligible * millennials had shown up , that would have been around 840,000 people . 
  if 64 % of them voted for bernie , that 's damn near a win for sanders . 
  there are [ more than 4 million people ] ( http://www.infoplease.com/us/census/data/texas/demographic.html ) in texas , in the age group that bernie targeted . 
  if 64 % of them turned out to vote it would n't have just won bernie the state ... with almost three times the votes hillary had ... it would have shocked american politics almost as badly as brexit . 
  millennials giving a shit about politics is a nightmare to a lot of people who make a lot of money and hold a lot of influence . 
  that 's why they work so hard to convince them not to participate . 
  [ by the numbers ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/25/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers/ ) in the us there are more millennials than baby boomers . 
  but when politicians ignore them and the news reports do n't explain things easily enough , and the process seems too complicated and even corrupt they just do n't bother . 
  and believe me , that 's exactly what a lot of politicians want . 
  just stay home . 
  if you 're not * passionate * about some issue , do n't vote . 
  that 's why they cater to the crazies . 
  the crazies are passionate enough to show up and vote . 
  that 's why they cater to the old folks , they 're passionate enough to show up and vote . 
  young people ca n't be bothered , and they 're literally pissing away all of their power and authority by doing so . 
  even in an election like this , where most people stayed home and they could have created a truly shocking outcome , all they did was bitch about it on reddit and whine about how they lose so `` god damn always '' . 
  if you mean the first part , [ 17-year olds can vote in primaries ] ( http://www.fairvote.org/primary_voting_at_age_17#facts_17_year_old_primary_voting ) in a bunch of states , but only if the individual will be 18 by the time the election comes around . 
  if you mean the second part ... as to why only 98 % of people voted for hillary or bernie ... iowa is one of the first states to vote and there were several other candidates , they just did n't have very strong campaigns . 
  if you mean overall how bernie could win those percentages and lose the state , that 's answered outside the quote ... 17-29 year olds were less than 20 % of the total turnout . 
   brexit succeeded because the young failed to vote stay on target , gold five . 
  well , the article gave uk as one example . 
  i gave the us as another , which is n't europe but is a pretty recent example of a politician with almost unheard of popularity among younger voters utterly failing to turn that into results at the polls . 
  the sentiment that it 's ` universal ' is [ well founded ] ( http://www.idea.int/publications/vt/upload/voter%20turnout.pdf ) ( skip to page 37 ( it 's listed as 111 at the bottom of the text though ) . 
  and there 's [ this article ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/12/18/many-in-emerging-and-developing-nations-disconnected-from-politics/ ) from pew global a couple of years ago about `` emerging '' democracies . 
   in 21 of 30 countries , young people are significantly less likely to vote compared with those age 50 and older , with differences of 15 percentage points or more in about half of the countries surveyed . 
  but contrast it with  in 22 of 31 countries , 18 to 29 year olds are more likely to post links to political articles and post their own comments or thoughts about politics online . 
  it 's not that they do n't want to be involved , it 's just that registering ( if it 's required ) and then going and spending 20 minutes at the polling place seems too much bother or something . 
  even in states with closed primaries , like delaware and new mexico and pennsylvania , sanders could n't muster enough support among the general electorate and could n't muster enough youth voters to go out to the polls . 
  usually when someone wants to make a claim that a previous statement is `` not true at all '' they do so with links to back up their position . 
  since you did n't bother to provide any , i 'll do it for you . 
  here 's [ iowa ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/02/bernie-sanders-crushed-hillary-clinton-by-70-points-among-young-people-in-iowa-but/ ) ... won by clinton . 
   among voters between the ages of 17 and 29 , bernie sanders won 84 percent of the vote to hillary clinton 's 14 percent . 
  17-29 year old voters were 18 % of the turnout . 
  here 's [ texas ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/01/us/elections/texas-democrat-poll.html ) ... won by clinton . 
   18-29 ( 21 % of voters ) clinton 34 % , sanders 64 % . 
  [ tennessee ] ( http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/tn/dem ) ... won by clinton . 
  18-29 , 15 % of voters . 
  clinton 39 % , sanders 51 % . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/oh/dem ) ohio . 
  18-29 , 15 % of voters . 
  clinton 19 % . 
  sanders 81 % . 
  [ south carolina ] ( http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/sc/dem ) , 18-29 were 7 % of the turnout . 
  clinton 40 % , sanders 60 % . 
  [ illinois ] ( http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/il/dem ) , 18-29 were 10 % of the voters .
