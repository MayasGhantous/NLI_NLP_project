  nato ) , or do you wait for the bear to recover , naively assuming it 's goals will be different afterwards ? 
   except baltics , , poland and probably romania so , basically all the ones russia was concerned about ? 
  actually , i 'm repeating the words of eastern europeans . 
  the lithuanian ambassador to the uk , responding to corbyn 's very article , specifically denounced the idea that they were `` lured in as part of an american power grab '' : https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/lithuania-is-safer-with-nato-mr-corbyn, 
   they are greatly influenced and overtly dependant on the usa to make a move and in terms of military support . 
  germany and france did n't support the u.s. in iraq . 
  france did their own thing in mali . 
  european countries are n't foreign policy puppets for the us , though they are dependent on the us for defense in many aspects ( your fault , not ours . 
  just being honest here . 
  if european countries invested more money into their own armies , they 'd be able to take the lead more often . ), 
   there have always been far right wing parties . 
  the front national , alleanza nazionale-lega nord , pvv , ecc . 
  have existed for a while already . 
  it 's just that they got pro russian and more euroskeptical all of a sudden as of late ( around 2011-2012 i 'd say ) . 
  that said , their existence does n't mean that there can be another tide that makes federalist ideas popular again . 
  correct , but euroskepticism is no longer a fringe ideology . 
  while federalism may eventually become popular enough that a common european army will be created , that day clearly is n't in the near future . 
  until then , any weakening of nato will just be a boon for russia . 
  ignoring the fact that nato members are n't really the us 's puppets in foreign policy , one has to acknowledge that a european army simply is n't going to happen in the current political climate . 
  if it occurs at all , it 's not going to occur within the next decade . 
  you 've got significant eurosceptic movements in every country , and even many europhiles are n't hot on the idea . 
  how are you going to get enough countries to consent to further surrender their sovereignty in the form of joining a unified army ? 
   currently , nato 's interference in eastern europe is providing russia with the hell of an excuse for expanding . 
  that 's crap . 
  you 're just repeating what russian propaganda says . 
  eastern european countries joined nato to be protected from russian aggression . 
  russian aggresion is the cause of nato expansion , not the result of it . 
  you need to think long term . 
  a weaker nato leads to russian dominance in continental europe . 
  that would cause problems for britain down the line . 
  in europe , being anti-nato does make you ( de facto ) pro-russia , as nato is the main force opposing russian expansion . 
  if britain were to pull out of nato , or stopped being a team player , nato would be significantly weakened , which would be a great boon to russia . 
  corbyn wrote editorials blaming nato for the russia 's invasion of ukraine , claiming that nato provoked putin . 
  he also wants britain to pull out of nato . 
  make of that what you will . 
  jeremy corbyn , the party 's leader , wrote editorials defending russia 's invasion of ukraine . 
  labour is kind of more serious than that , no ? 
  the current leader of labour is a putin apologist . 
  if labour were voted into power , well , the country would take a very different stance on russia . 
  turkey is n't a complete dictatorship yet , but it 's `` getting there '' . 
  even putin allows some protest marches and nobody claims he 's a democratic leader . 
  considering the large scale expansion of presidential power and the large scale compression of civil rights in turkey , it 's a pretty clear example of a `` creeping dictatorship '' . 
  and any movement which is a serious threat to erdogan gets crushed eventually . 
  do n't argue with me on that - i was in istanbul during the taksim protests . 
  i saw the repression with my own eyes . 
  that 's because there 's this big geographical barrier called `` the sahara desert '' which restricts the movement of people north and south . 
  does anyone still use those windmills , or are they just for the tourists ? 
  progress is faster now than ever  . 
  i 've been there , it was a serious spiritual experience for me . 
  so incredibly beautiful !, 
  the holy see 's representatives at the un represent the papacy , not the physical country of the vatican . 
  think of it like this : you are the head of a organization a. 
  you are also the head of a country b. 
  by country b 's laws , the head of organization a is always the head of country b. 
  in such a situation , the `` real world '' distinction between the organization and the country can become blurred at times , but * legally * , they 're still two separate entities . 
  the holy see is essentially the institution of the papacy . 
  it is a seperate entity from the vatican , which is the physical country . 
   ukraine was a founding state of the ussr . 
  calling it `` annexation '' is alt-history at its finest . 
  that `` ukraine '' was a bolshevik puppet created after the bolsheviks invaded and destroyed the ukrainian people 's republic . 
  who 's spouting alt-history again ? 
   you guys really need to come to your senses maybe you can not be so rude for no fucking reason ? 
   at least some of your ancestors i 'm not ukrainian . 
   this same historical heritage . 
  you go as far as bolding this '' , and yet the post clearly says `` the '' . 
  two letter difference , but very different meaning . 
  and saying that anna started franco-russian relations is clearly claiming russia 's preeminence to the history . 
   that is not a fair interpretation of what happened . 
  it was more like ukraine failing to become independent from moscow than moscow annexing an independent ukraine . 
  but had it not been for the soviet victory , ukraine would have become independent . 
  indeed , it 's conceivable that some sequence of events could have led to an independent ukrainian state after wwi . 
  my point here is that saying ukraine would never have been independent without the soviets creating an `` autonomous '' republic is extremely misleading . 
  anyhow , i think this is a faulty distinction . 
  the ukrainian state of 1917-1919 was short-lived , but it was a state that was independent from moscow for a time . 
   this fact alone contradicts the fact that ussr denied the existence of ukrainians . 
  sure , there were russification policies but it is not the same as outright denial . 
  the soviets did create seperate `` republics '' , but on a whole they tended to repress or at least discourage national identities . 
  it 's true they did n't outright deny the existence of a distinct ukrainian identity - that was the schtick of the tsarist regime , which has recently been revived by russian propagandists - but they did try to repress it . 
  to me , the difference between `` not asserting ukrainian identity and repressing it '' and `` denying ukrainian identity and repressing it '' is just semantic . 
   ukraine and belarus got themselves national autonomous republics in ussr and thanks to that are now independent . 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  the soviets invaded and annexed the independent [ ukrainian state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_people%27s_republic ) . 
  claiming ukraine owes its independence to the soviets is completely backwards and downright insulting to all the ukrainians who died fighting to defend their country 's freedom from soviet tyranny . 
  the soviets did roll back russification policies in the 1920 's , but they stopped in the 30 's because they realized that allowing groups to express their own culture led to nationalistic sentiment , thus threatening the authority of the communist regime . 
  okay , thanks . 
  i ca n't say i completely agree with your analogy . 
  mainly because the 11th century was before either ukrainian or russian identity existed . 
  claiming she was anything other than kievan rus ( distinct from both the modern ukrainian and russian identities ) is nationalistic dick waving . 
  i stand by what i said about the russian tweet being offensive , though . 
  you 'll have to enlighten me , is there some background to this incident i do n't understand ? 
  it 's not a lie to say that russia , ukraine , and belarus all have shared history . 
  it ** is ** a lie to say that russia , belarus , and ukraine all have the ** same ** historical heritage . 
  the two are not the same thing . 
  germany and austria have shared history , but it 's complete nonsense to say they have the have the same history . 
  in light of propaganda that ukrainians are really just a rebellious subgroup of russians , it 's even more insensitive . 
  kind of a silly response by ukraine , but that russian tweet is offensive as hell and filled with a very troubling subtext . 
  russia and the soviet union before/after them have denied the existence of a seperate belarussian or ukrainian identity for over a century . 
  this has been used to justify moscow 's domination of these places . 
  if you 're ukrainian , you might find the seemingly innocuous tweet very insulting , especially since so much if ukraine 's history deals with repression and imperialism from russia . 
  it 's always nice to see a people reasserting their culture after a century of repression .
