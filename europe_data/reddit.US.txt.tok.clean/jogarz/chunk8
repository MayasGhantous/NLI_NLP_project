   they never cared for the people , only themselves , which goes against the basic principles of communism . 
  hoo boy , i know we like to pretend that people from our tribe that we do n't like `` were n't true scotsmen '' , as the trope goes , but this is really stretching it . 
  plenty of the figures mentioned here as examples of communist tyrants were absolutely true marxist believers by every piece of evidence we have . 
   communism was just propaganda and an excuse to keep the people thinking that the government actually cared for them and their rights . 
  `` we will bury you ! '', 
  does this sound like the words of someone who 's only in it for the wealth and power , and uses ideology as a tool , or someone who genuinely believes in his ideology 's inherent superiority and inevitable triumph ? 
  gee , it 's almost like the right/left wing axis is a construct of ideology rather than an objective truth . 
  it 's important to remember that people on the left wing can be very nationalistic as well . 
  i would be unsurprised . 
  pkk consider the police legitimate military targets . 
  sorry , but that 's not even comparable : - ** glasgow ** : 2.7 murders per 100,000 people . 
  - ** st. louis ** : 59.2 - ** baltimore ** : 55 - ** detroit ** : 43.9 - ** new orleans ** : 41.4 sorry , but that was a really , really bad connection to try and make on your part . 
  inner city crime is n't exactly an endemic problem in scotland , mate . 
  be reasonable . 
  yeah , this is kind of an awkward question . 
  if it 's `` trust the military to defend the country '' and not `` trust the military not to commit a coup/be corrupt '' , these results make more sense . 
  but it 's not specific enough . 
  yeah , this is a particular problem with la\u00efcit\u00e9 from what i hear . 
  it was created mainly with catholics , nonreligious , and protestants in mind , but not all religions are created equal . 
  because of that , at a certain point la\u00efcit\u00e9 starts to become incompatible with freedom of religion . 
  for instance , restrictions on religious attire in schools and the refusal to make exceptions to dress code for religious beliefs is n't a big deal for christians , but is very frustrating for muslims due to the hijab . 
  this case is kind of the opposite . 
  islam is a decentralized religion , so banning foreign funding does n't really cause many problems as far as freedom of religion . 
  for catholics , though , this could be seen has restricting the church 's authority to conduct its own affairs . 
  military expenditures are an easy target for politicians . 
  it 's easy to make vainglorious speeches about how the money should go to helping people instead of buying evil weapons of death . 
  this seemingly forgets that most of the military budget is not actually tied up in acquisitions , so cuts usually affect those working for the military instead in the form of layoffs and pay cuts . 
  no , i 'm an american and i do n't remember it either . 
   the point is , china is way too powerful than taiwan , it 's strength and potential is almost limitless compared to russia . 
  what does russia have ? 
  their nuclear arsenal is mostly defensive . 
  apart from that , not much . 
  semi-military geek here , this is n't * quite * accurate . 
  the russians have a stronger and more advanced air force , a more developed military/industrial complex , and a lot more practical experience : russia has fought several wars since 1991 , and the prc really has n't . 
  i 'd also say that the situation is n't quite as hopeless as it seems . 
  amphibious invasions are hard and the prc both lacks experience and equipment for the endeavor . 
  if the roc was willing it could probably stop a prc invasion . 
  a possible naval blockade , on the other hand , would be more threatening . 
  ah yes , the good old false dilemma . 
  u/stanzololthrowaway is n't necessarily insinuating that erdogan did the coup . 
  you also are being evasive . 
  you 're not giving any evidence for gulen 's supposed involvement by claiming there 's no evidence erdogan was involved . 
   get indoctrinated by your priest otherwise known as `` being influenced by another human being and their ideas '' . 
   get indoctrinated by your priest otherwise known as `` being influenced by another human being and their ideas '' . 
   you 're projecting us issues on specific european country . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  literally the only reason you 're saying this is my flair . 
   you could still dress the way you did , have your own style of . 
  you 've got to be kidding me . 
  you mention the most surface , shallow elements of a culture . 
  religion is one of the most important and defining aspects of a people . 
  if you 're going to deny that simple fact there 's no point in continuing this discussion . 
  religion and faith form part of the very core of many european cultures . 
   in those places , priests literally indoctrinate people into specific political sphere , which is an antithesis of secularism . 
  literally one of the dumbest things i 've ever heard . 
  like seriously . 
  first of all , people being influenced by their religious beliefs and leaders is perfectly fine . 
  you call it `` indoctrination '' because you do n't like the ideology . 
  in reality people can be and should be influenced by their ideology . 
  people get their values from others : parents , teachers , and yes , priests . 
  when you do n't like thise values , the act of them being passed on is called `` indoctrination '' . 
  and the existence of religious people participating in politics is not the antithesis of secularism . 
  secularism is the seperation of the bodies of church and state . 
  people can still belong to both bodies . 
  what you want is state atheism . 
   and secular state is a basic european value . 
  you might want it to be , but it really is n't . 
  it 's an enlightenment value , but the idea of a `` european value '' is highly nebulous and laughable . 
  how can it be a `` european value '' when the kind of secularism you want ( read : state atheism ) has never been widely popular ? 
  how about the fact that it 's always been a matter of debate ? 
  it 's not like democracy or freedom of religion , the idea of repressing religion by forcing it out of the public sphere is extremely controversial . 
  how about the extremely heavy influence christianity has left on the peoples of europe , even you , forming the bedrock of many of their values ? 
  more than half of europe does n't follow this `` basic european value '' of religious repression . 
   :d it 's a documented thing here , there 's books about this issue . 
  f off . 
  i do n't care about the books , you 've just failed to provide any evidence such a thing exists  are you mentally handicapped or something ? 
  wow , you really do sound . 
  `` you wo n't accept my bigoted claims without any evidence ? 
  retard ! '', 
  grow up . 
   they are breaking the law . 
  you have n't really explained how . 
   according to whom ? 
  some random americanski on the interwebs . 
  it 's a well known problem with some churches here . 
  nice prejudice you 've got there . 
  have you ever been to confession ? 
  there 's no such thing as a promotion in confession . 
  grow up and stop talking like a child . 
   tax exemptions . 
  lobbying regulations . 
  different from other non-profits how ? 
   more importantly , it creates politicians who run on one platform but also get votes from the church goers who have opposing views , it 's a hindrance to democracy . 
  stupid poor religious people , why do n't they listen to their educated urban elite !, 
  they 're too stupid to vote for someone who shares their views . 
  and yeah , i still do n't see the difference from an endorsement . 
  your prejudice is really thinly disguised . 
   promising to promote them in confession a `` promotion in confession '' is n't an actual thing - confession is confession - so i think you need to be a bit more skeptical . 
   if priests want to have a say in politics they should stand for office themselves , rather than trying to sabotage the democratic process . 
  you totally fail to explain how it 's different from any other public interest group .
