always embarrassing , when i fail to repel nazis . 
  puts a damper on the whole weekend . 
  ~ ~ britain ~ ~ ~ ~ germany ~ ~ ~ ~ paris ~ ~ ~ ~ america ~ ~ earth is full !, 
   her motivation , who knows ? 
  `` all taxes should go to us corporations because governments will just waste it anyways . '', 
  sounds like you 're lubed up and ready to go . 
  six stars , motherfucka, 
  * please explain * it 's a lost cause . 
  someone like you will never understand . 
  try not to give them the satisfaction of militarizing your society . 
  goes without saying , but still . 
  * / r/european has been openly calling for attacks like this right here on reddit * someone 's about to get banninated . 
  say `` hi '' to coontown and fph for me , boys . 
  as were the daleks . 
  you 're grasping at straws . 
  * people who advocate socialized healthcare are dangerous because some people want a violent revolution to install a communist dictatorship by the same logic . 
  * right out of the nra playbook . 
  nice to see we have n't cornered the market on retarded similes . 
  * a slippery slope towards terrorism and mass murder . 
  * pardon , but how how much more fuckin ' evidence you need ? 
  your gliberteries do n't matter more than my life , i 'll you that much . 
  countryside condom ? 
  tldr ; i reject your reality and substitute my own . 
  i 'm reminded of gore vidal 's line ( about the us being china 's `` farm '' and europe their `` boutique . '' ), 
  the russians say , `` what about us ? '', 
  :( gore shakes his head and says they were n't mentioned but , if they get their act together , they may end up as ski instructors . 
  * i have a feeling that americans won so many times that they do n't see the threat anymore . 
  * we 're just taking our ball and going home . 
  no , wait , i got a better one . 
  it 's like we 're losing a chess match , so we drop our trousers , jump on the board and waggle our balls over the pieces . 
  that 's a more fitting description of our economy of late . 
  it 's 4000 years old , surely that counts for something too, 
  in fairness , china needs to get its shit together and expand to its markets . 
  relying on the us is a sword of damocles . 
  just train more lawyers . 
  worked like gangbusters over here . 
  you can always count on an american to promote opportunism, 
  wonder why she took credit for letting the refugees in . 
  she 's normally so slippery . 
  maybe she ran out of buses to throw people under . 
  they 're usually more informed about it than yee-hawin shitkickers who prowl reddit looking for `` foreigners '' to denigrate, 
  first time i 've agreed with an american on this sub . 
  ( says the american ), 
  big nations fight for money , not politics or religion . 
  it will take a while before westerners fight each other again . 
  i ca n't imagine how ravaged we 'd have to be , to wage war on our trading partners . 
  we have everything to lose . 
  a mideast crisis involving russia and china seems likely , sure . 
  but ah dunno about wwiii . 
  seems alarmist . 
  this is the craziest thing i 've read since chris knowles said star trek was cult brainwashing . 
  trump did n't have a ground game . 
  never visited virginia . 
  wth the answer , i suspect , is that he did n't have to . 
  people know him from tv , they have a history with him -- more than most elected officials . 
  it 's the same reason why ronald reagan was the presidential ideal . 
  the worst part is , he wo n't even appreciate it . 
  fuck back off to trump tower every other week . 
  i hate that the trump family is a permanent fixture in american politics . 
  hopefully he 'll drink cyanide , just like his avatar augustus melmotte . 
  democratically elected !, 
  lol your party literally accused us of trucking in black panthers to intimidate white voters last time . 
  i think this rule book existed in your head only . 
  basket implies a small number . 
  her slogan is `` stronger together '' for christ 's sake . 
  some people are just reactionary by nature . 
  they look around at the comfortable modern world and see a sick society . 
  jill stein is a con artist who took money from monsanto , so it 's a good thing you are n't a citizen . 
  in what way has the democratic side been hateful ? 
  untested , one-issue candidate and a poor campaigner/debater . 
   in the uk `` yes '' means yes and `` no '' ** germany ** : ... ... ... ... yes ? 
  ** uk ** : [ whaddaya mean `` no '' ?!, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=damqmerpiiy ), 
  do n't be thick . 
  you and i both know the uk is n't looking eastward for a health care model . 
  make black monolith great again, 
  beware the old hegemonic overlords !, 
  rally behind the new ones !, 
  i agree wholeheartedly . 
  it 's a testament to the power of propaganda . 
  bush needed a bogeyman to drum up support , but he could n't put it back in the box . 
  there were people walking around in army fatigues and yellow ribbons , saying , `` if saddam comes we 're going to fight to the death '' . 
  watching videos of isis , it 's laughable now . 
  oh , bless , a world leader who stands for precisely zilch . 
  we needed another one . 
  he let saddam live . 
  i was a kid but i remember the hysteria surrounding saddam for 10 solid years . 
  people were wondering why he did n't seal the deal . 
  `` we will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own '', 
  denial is not a river in egypt, 
  at least your persecution complex is unscathed . 
  `` tommy vercetti made this look easy . '', 
   `` they could stick a shotgun up me arse , pull the trigger two times and still miss '' -- gene hunt on skinheads, 
  * green hill zone music intensifies *, 
  that figure keeps growing . 
  the lancet reported it was a hundred thousands deaths . 
  that became a half million during the albreight interview ( `` we * heard * it it was half a million '' ) . 
  i 've even heard it blamed for the 9/11 attacks . 
  now it 's a million ? 
   the main thing it did wrong was not doing enough to help iraq recover .
