  neofuckery, 
  afaik he 's just following the putin playbook . 
  get the church to talk you up as some sort of holy man . 
  rant and rave about a permanent enemy which is n't tangible . 
  nuture the middle class just enough to convince them things are n't so bad . 
  keep them dumb with fake news and reality tv shows . 
  they just had a meeting in washington dc . 
  lots of reporters were there . 
  you can drop the `` no such thing as the mafia '' angle , it 's pretty stupid at this point . 
  in hindsight , ed came a few years early . 
  now that tensions with russia have receded a bit ... on the other hand , what the uk desires above all else is poker face and a steady pair of hands for brexit . 
  so it appears they 're locked in . 
  he 's certifiable . 
  he takes money from warlords ( apparently something tony 's been doing since sierra leone ) and thinks god picked him to usher in world peace . 
  it 's unknown whether cherie manipulated him and made him more money hungry , or if he was always off his rocker , it 's not really clear . 
  the criticisms of the campaign are valid . 
  clinton reminded me so much of kusinich half the time : boxing shadows , unable to sell her vision of a united america , because like it or not , maga is a change from the status quo . 
  it 's probably the greatest slogan in the history of politics . 
  but `` people are angry '' is not the constructive response to `` make america great again '' . 
  i think sanders ' heart is in the right place , but all he ultimately light the fuse on a militant left movement . 
  we 're seeing it now with the armed demonstrations . 
  obama/clinton were the obstacle standing between the center left , as represented by me , and the gun waving , wannabe weathermen . 
  it 's all perfectly predictable from here . 
  while trump is amusing us on twitter , some law & order figurehead like clarke will gently shut the door on our cages . 
   tyt affiliates in fairness , i do n't follow the other vloggers you mentioned . 
  but you 've been monitoring tyt all this time . 
  you did n't overhear them constantly threatening a `` nuclear war with syria/iran/russia is clinton was elected ? 
  planning a protest on election day if she won ? 
  demanding a [ purge ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/cenkuygur/status/797895370739093506?ref_src=twsrc^google | twcamp ^ serp | twgr ^ tweet ) of all democrats who supported the nominee ? 
  i recall jimmy dore rooting for president trump by the end . 
  ( `` it 's better for progressives in the long run ! '' ), 
  splitting the left was a campaign strategy we all saw coming . 
  i do n't consider them socialists in any meaningful sense . 
  i consider them bolsheviks , in that they 're calling for a vanguard party to pick up the pieces after the republicans accelerate the collapse of our economy . 
  it 's always the same with smug socialists . 
  i remember marching in a may day parade in union square with people shouting `` long live gaddafi '' . 
  for the last time , libya \u2260 iraq . 
  syria \u2260 iraq . 
  they were fast approaching civil war before the eu got involved . 
  pretty rich getting a lecture on third partyism from someone with that flair . 
   every progressive i was progressive until that election . 
  read my chomsky , wto , class war , all that jazz . 
  then i was kicked out of the tent for not voting sanders . 
  my eyes were opened to what passes for ` progressive ' here . 
  there is no progressive left in the us . 
  it 's more of a neo-bolshevik faction . 
  they read the same blogs and worship the same idols as the libertarian-right . 
  and heaven help you if you suggest russia is no better or worse than the us . 
   [ american-born , european soul ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5cl8gz/if_i_apply_to_school_in_germany_could_my/d9xcq7c/ ) wew lad, 
  do n't rub it in . 
  our american sultan is mingling with the chinese in his gold plated penthouse . 
  he 'll have a victory fuck in the master bedroom of the white house , then fly back to tt and never return . 
  about as `` jewish '' as samuel l. jackson . 
  12 if ivanka runs . 
  keep sticking the boot in , kia . 
  `` it 's nato or the eu 's fault that russia got so shitty that i had to leave . '', 
  putin has a lot of leeway when it comes to public opinion , because russia is under siege by definition . 
  u/fat _ osvaldo is a #pizzagate promoter who comes into the sub to stir up anti-american sentiment . 
  ooh a man of mystery . 
  apologies , but you seem to be rooting for them . 
  all the hyperbole about `` god emperor '' disguised the fact that they actually think that way . 
  chasing a prospect only a caesar can provide . 
  since there are no caesars , they had to invent one . 
  trump is a discarded cheetos bag ; he is completely irrelevant to the alt-right movement . 
  this is filling a void in their lives caused by the evils of `` globalism and modernism . 
  to quote russell mael , * hasta manana monsieur * * were only words that i knew for sure * * c'est la vie , c'est la morte , say no more , say no more *, 
  i want to rest inside it , like a baby bird . 
  she 's actually 30 . 
  prematurely wizened by years of calling on dark power . 
   ploy to lure press to a rally . 
  nice to know our most flatulent pundit is now our president . 
  i 'm sure that wo n't set a terrible precedent . 
  get a dictionary . 
   uk politicians will be forced to take responsibility this could be spoken by a kipper or a corbynite . 
  the one thing we 've learned from this mess is the left * and * right have an incredible capacity for self-deception . 
  you post on r/conspiracy , the sky is always falling no matter what . 
  there 's no question hillary was the better option , but your constant talk of pedophilia and ww3 helped install trump . 
  first-hand experience in second-hand love, 
  i do n't believe he actually exists . 
  he is a tony clifton-type parody . 
  hit 'n run putinbot . 
  you 'll never get a reply to that . 
  are you suggesting honest don might mislead us :(, 
  well , see ... he never * meant * to be leader of the free world . 
  he wants to be a sino-russian junior partner . 
  less work , still get the perks hey ? 
  election 's over , they 're still gunning for that foundation ? 
  in this keeps up , the clintons may be driven out of their native land . 
  you can play innocent all you want . 
  in the week of the us election , your silver fox assange accused a presidential candidate of worshipping the devil . 
  get any sleep ? 
  lol * buggers off to crawford tx *, 
  `` blood and semen and breast milk ( but mostly blood ) '' no one takes wikileaks seriously any more . 
  they 're as bad if not worse than infowars . 
  i d e n t i t y p o l i t i c s, 
  they will get louder . 
  this election proved ( to them ) that reddit is an invaluable tool in the alt-right war . 
  confirmation bias . 
  prisoner 's dilemma . 
  corbyn is anti-west generally .
