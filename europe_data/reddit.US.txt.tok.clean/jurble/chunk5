  i suppose i 'll start using it . 
  [ dis thread . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/jokes/comments/38mzks/i_bought_a_russian_porno_magazine_the_other_day/crwg1pm ) there was more to that thread back when i first saw it , there was a russian nationalist type complaining about the accents of the girls in russian porn vids , and how they were all clearly russian-speaking ukrainian accents , but his comments seem to have all been deleted . 
  i read elsewhere on reddit that russian porn is produced across the border in the baltics . 
   but if a kurdish state stretches to turkey 's border in the future , i imagine things will get interesting in the eastern areas of turkey , erdogan 's gov ' t already said last year that they would support iraqi kurdistan 's independence , and they already negotiated an oil deal with iraqi kurdistan against baghdad 's wishes . 
  so the turkish gov ' t does n't have issues with at least iraqi kurdistan being independent , so i do n't know exactly why they want to destroy ypg . 
  i 'm not familiar with the situation , but i 'd guess ypg is ideologically less friendly with turkey than the iraqi kurdistan gov ` t ? 
  or maybe they want a `` klein kurdistan '' option , a small independent kurdistan that they can ship all the kurdish nationalists to . 
  [ dis guy is one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walter_a._mcdougall ) although he 's a historian . 
  it 's a characterization i 've read in various news and opinion articles over the years . 
  but yeah , i deleted that portion of my initial comment , but you read it before i edited , mainly since it 's a characterization i 've seen , but whether it 's any sort of academic consensus , i would n't say . 
  post-stalin , most soviet leaders and members of the politburo were scientists or engineers . 
  the same goes for modern china , most members of the politburo are engineers and scientists . 
  xi jinping is a chemical engineer . 
  if you do a search on technocracy on google scholar , you can find a number of articles about china and some really old ones from the 70s and 80s on the ussr ( if you do a normal google search on the new york times , you 'll see the soviet union was referred to as a technocracy very often in the 80 's ) . 
  technocracy in general does n't seem to be a popular academic topic . 
   it has n't been done , just because it has n't been done does n't mean it would suck though . 
  both modern china and the ussr are and were considered to be technocracies . 
  it was in iran , i do n't know if he was kurdish-iranian or not , but the story is that he was a convict and was given a furlough from prison for a holiday ( eid i assume ) , and decided to kill his daughters while he was out . 
  it 's interesting , but the picture of the kid really does n't look like putin . 
  it was romanticized even during the medieval period , and it happened on occasion that monarchs themselves were afflicted with chivalric madness against better sense like [ john the good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_ii_of_france ) who did basically the same thing . 
  the report itself reveals the reason :  to sum up , the british tradition of behaving as herrenvolk is kept up by the prisoners of war . 
  their presence in germany is thoroughly demoralising , since their behaviour not only typifies a nation which is racially akin to ours , strong , and absolutely sure of victory - but also has given rise to discussions about the futility of a war between two nations of the same stock . 
  herrenvolk is master race . 
  the nazis actually * expect * the british to act this way , and one even wonders if the report is exaggerated or certain actions of individual soldiers emphasized or generalized to the entire british pows to fit the nazi racial biases . 
  the proposition system is n't that bad . 
  it 's really just this [ proposition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/california_proposition_13_%281978%29 ) that ruined everything , since they basically made it impossible for their state to ever raise taxes , making other things they voted for , like [ high-speed rail ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/california_proposition_1a_%282008%29 ) , very difficult to implement . 
  china and the ussr are both usually described as technocracies because they did exactly that . 
  even in the us ( and i 'm sure other countries ) the various department heads have relevant degrees . 
  it did n't really work out well for the ussr , at least in economy , since the state ideology was marxist-leninist and that 's what all their economists were trained as . 
  they did n't actually , they followed the caspian 's coasts around through iran , then forcibly vassalized georgia and then invaded kievan rus through the caucasus with georgia auxiliaries . 
  completely skipped the urals . 
   negligible ? 
  you realize that nearly all young men were dead or mutilated right ? 
  yes , negligible . 
  germany lost , as a proportion of her male population , roughly the same as france . 
  by 1939 , its population was larger than than in 1914 . 
  compare [ france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_france#/media/file:population2centuries.jpg ) and [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany#/media/file:population_of_german_territories_1800_-_2000.jpg ) . 
  the french birth-rate was simply low ( and had been for a century prior ) . 
  the german birth-rate was higher ( as was the english ) . 
   after wwi i think the rate was 1 unmarried man for 4 unmarried women , in a monogamous society this is problematic . 
  germany would 've suffered a similar cohort ( age-group ) deficit of males . 
  it did n't matter . 
  the french low birth-rate was something the french government was well aware of , to the point where banning abortion was supported even by the socialist and communists . 
  the population impact of the wars were negligible . 
  [ france simply had lower birth-rates than its neighbors through the 19th century . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_france#historical_overview )  the french population only grew by 8.6 % between 1871 and 1911 , while germany 's grew by 60 % and britain 's by 54 %, 
  news mainly . 
  i like to know what 's going on in the world . 
  their kings were imported etruscans , iirc . 
  so probably . 
  in the historical sources , the english lump all the vikings as ` danes ' . 
  molecular analysis on viking burials in england show they were basically from all over the north sea . 
  danes did predominate , but probably only because denmark 's population was way larger than either norway or sweden . 
  same thing has happened in america . 
  even when i was young , the local river had no fish and no birds . 
  now there 's birds everywhere , and the fishing is very good because people are still unaware that the fish population recovered . 
  and english uses ` woods ' for forest also . 
  the funny thing is , is that the modern consensus is that it 's [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alise-sainte-reine ) . 
  meaning its location was lost despite its name never really changing and it never becoming uninhabited . 
  ha , when i read the title i immediately thought of a western movie setting as well . 
  sounds like something a self-consciously evil german empire , like one ruled by the sith or something , would call its army . 
  yeah i knew a turk in college who called himself georgian . 
  interestingly , he actually had what sounded like to me a georgian ( he sounded like saakeshvili ) accent as opposed to turkish . 
  i thought that was interesting . 
   the unlawful games act 1541 required every englishman between the ages of 17 and 60 ( with various exemptions ) to keep a longbow and regularly practise archery . 
  however , this act was repealed by the betting and gaming act 1960 . 
  the fact it was only repealed in 1960 is hilarious . 
  according to 19th century geographical determinism , the reason is that colder weather -  more intensive agriculture necessary to survive -  serious mentality . 
  warm weather -  throw out some seeds haphazardly -  indolence . 
  interestingly , the french birthrate has been low since the napoleonic wars-era , to the point that where france once had a population equal to the rest of europe , by the mid 19th century , it had fallen behind ( what would be ) germany and the english reached parity . 
  it was actually a huge national security concern for france , especially after ww1 , when they lost so many men . 
  i do n't actually know how france fixed its birthrates , [ but they did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_france#1800_to_20th_century ) . 
  what are they expecting of putin ? 
  i did n't say the russians expect carpet bombing , but that there 's two possibilities behind the russians downplaying the bombing scenario as hard as they did initially - fear of discontent or unwillingness to escalate - two scenarios on the literal opposite of the response spectrum . 
  i lean towards fear of escalation simply because that 's what * the world * expects of russia . 
  i qualified the part about the russian people because * i do n't know * what the russian people will want . 
  but i * do know * the world expects russian escalation , and russia 's image is vital to putin . 
  putin 's goal of a multipolar world rests on presenting russian power as an alternative to american ( or chinese ) hegemony , at least within its local neighborhood . 
  a weak international image undoes all the work he 's done to undermine american hegemony . 
  egypt and russian gov ' t seemed bent from the start on downplaying the possibility . 
  egypt 's motivation was obvious - bad for tourism . 
  but why russia insistent on the possibilities other than terrorism ? 
  either putin was afraid of discontent against his adventurism because of the casualties or because he does n't want to commit to more than just the tactical bombings . 
  i imagine it 's the latter . 
  but now that terrorism is the confirmed cause , the world and maybe even the russian people expect putin to go chechnya on isis . 
  carpet bombing raqqa is going to be expensive . 
  very often if the victim does n't want to press charges , the prosecutor wo n't pursue it , since without victim testimony a conviction could be difficult . 
  this is why you often see prosecutions of rich people never pan out , they settle with the victim/victim 's family out of court , and then the victim/their family refuses to cooperate with the prosecution . 
  that 's , supposedly , how nickelodeon 's dan schneider has escaped prosecution for decades . 
  in polanski 's case , he 's already convicted though . 
  the victim 's cooperation does n't mean anything at this point . 
  always found ossetes interesting . 
  on all those ancient world maps , scythians and sarmatians cover such a huge amount of land , for centuries . 
  now their linguistic descendants are restricted to such a small area . 
  people who still believe in salic law . 
  man , i was driving back to state college the one time and there was an amish or mennonite family out in their fields , the mom and the kids . 
  it looked like some 19th century romantic pastoral painting of dutch peasants come to life . 
       a caliphate would just erode the turkish identity and thus not make '' turkey great again '' . 
  this was one of the ideas behind ottomanism - an attempt to create a non-ethnic national identity in the ottoman empire in like the 1840s ?
