  expats only pay if they make over $ 100,800 a year . 
  and then they get to deduct the nation they 're living in 's taxes to a certain degree on top of that . 
  i ca n't believe the economist got it so wrong . 
  could be worse , could be from jersey . 
  who says it 's european forces ? 
  the us has rapid response forces are around 40k and there 's about 5 of them . 
  their whole point is going to any point in the world in 48 hours . 
  us healthcare is garbage if you 're poor because you 're only getting what the state will pay for . 
  that 's because they take in equity as a larger factor than efficacy . 
  so is half that corner of the world . 
  but they stay in their corner , relatively , and he stays in his . 
  i do n't like using third party groups cause the screw with data . 
  for example , press . 
  look at laws in each country , publication rules in each country . 
  then you can put your own worldview over it . 
  do you think anyone should be able to publish whatever they want , no matter how hateful ? 
  do you believe there should be rules against inciting hatred ? 
  do you think that government press , with a mandate to be balanced , is better ? 
  there 's no `` better '' until you can argue it . 
  but definitely throw out people who use `` equity '' as measure , unless they 're measuring equity . 
  there 's groups that rate healthcare on efficacy and equity , and will make equity 50 % of their `` score . '', 
  so they 'd rate higher if the sick were sicker , as long as there was n't a cohort of super healthy people . 
  freedomhouse is such a bad source . 
  first they look at equity as a measure in their rankings . 
  second , their press rankings are complete bull , as they support state ownership . 
  they would rather have equality in the press ( their love of european press ) than truly free press . 
  they rate germany as higher than the us , despite their being constitutional limits on what can be printed while the us has constitutional stays against government interference in the press . 
  it 's completely pulled out of thin air . 
   of course , the next question is : what kind of policy would help make us society less violent ? 
  probably one that restricts access to gun , eventually . 
  that 's the difference between the us and europe . 
  european governments are guided by a different philosophy . 
  their goal , can be said to be a `` just '' or a `` fair '' or a `` safe '' society and this is reflected in their laws , rights , and powers . 
  the us , on the other hand , is very much solely focused on creating a `` free '' society . 
  where the concept of interest-balancing of rights , ( aka limit a right to preserve safety , justice , fairness , etc. ), 
  is repeatedly rejected as a viable approach . 
  for example , could literal nazis be allowed to march in a jewish neighborhood with a large population of holocaust survivors and espouse their views in europe ? 
  oh yeah , pretty much all nsfw . 
  lots of robbers getting killed .

  guns experience the lojack phenomenon . 
  when their ownership becomes even at a low enough degree that the chance is even rare , rather than non-existent , crime rates decrease as the fact is criminals are not looking to go to jail . 
  where lojack decreases the return on car theft , guns decrease the returns on general crime . 
  criminals are n't looking for a hard target , a big splashy sure thing . 
  its not ocean 's 11 . 
  it 's can i break in a get a thousand in goods to fence safely , or not ? 
  is it worth it ? 
  yah , he 's the much more famous one . 
  he got honorary citizenship and all . 
  israel does n't want him gone . 
  it really has no dog in the fight . 
  it 's stuck between a rock and a hard place , but while assad might have called for the destruction of israel , he knew where he stood militarily , which was never having a war . 
  he at least kept the border peaceful and relatively open . 
  and now greece gets a better chance of getting those dollars . 
  i can say that the green bay packers or carolina panthers are a `` top team '' whereas the lions or browns are n't . 
  the yankees are a top team , whereas the marlins are n't . 
  no , it makes him sound like a very high ranking general , which he was . 
  four star general is a colloquialism , like referring to a colonel as a full bird or a fresh lieutenant as butter bars . 
  he is properly described as one of france 's top generals , you 're trying to play semantics . 
  4 star general = / = top general ? 
   but europe and usa are culturally much closer than europe and indonesia are . 
  we 're not , we see the world much differently than europe does . 
  http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/11/17/the-american-western-european-values-gap/ and inasmuch as european history is american history , america for its first century refused to get involved in europe , for its second and onward refused anything less than leadership ( see de gaulle and the suez crisis ) . 
  to say european history , with a broad brush , is american history is farcical . 
  our idea of national identity/historical ties is `` cool my grandparents were from there . '', 
  my fathers side of the family is irish , my only tie historically to ireland is the fact my great grandmother was the first one off the boat because she was in the middle of giving birth so my grandfather could be born american . 
  my mothers side is all ukrainian and you could n't understand her english with her accent , but the last history i have there is that same grandmother who spoke ukrainian refused to let her kids speak anything but english . 
  our cultural and governmental history is uniquely english , but during the founding we became super obsessed with antiquity and modeled a lot on rome and greece . 
  there 's no multiculturalism in the us . 
  you become american , the only thing we save is the food we like and the holidays we can turn into a day off to drink . 
  that would be shocking , because she ran in the democratic primary not the gop primary . 
  but in the democratic primary she has 57 % of the vote to sanders 42 % . 
  she has over 3 million more votes than he does . 
  no really , by a vast degree , the us oil imports come from canada . 
  then latin america ( mexico + venezuela ) then sa , then nigeria , then 3 % from other places ( lots of tiny caribbean counties make up 1 % ) . 
  canada has been increasing its share of the us market by double digit numbers yearly . 
  solar power is neither reliable nor economically competitive . 
  why is it ignorant to not bother learning about a country ? 
  outside of england , germany , and france each country has a smaller gdp than us states . 
  if any european country ( except micro banking states and norway ) joined the united states , it would be among the poorest us states . 
  if the uk were to become the 51st state , it would be the poorest state , sweden would be bottom 10 . http://www.timbro.se/bokhandel/pdf/9175665646.pdf the simple question then is , why do n't you know about indonesian history , politics , and geography , or indian history , politics , and geography . 
  relatively speaking , they 'd fill in the world economic and military order to europe , that europe fills in for the united states . 
  did trump get more than 50 % of gop primary voters ? 
  he ca n't even get 50 % of gop primary voters . 
  why should we care ? 
  give me one good reason the average person should care about countries with gdps smaller than their state 's . 
  countries that are poorer than every state ( including mississippi ) . 
  europe , for the most part , is ( culturally ) saying `` look at us look at us , look at our ruins and our past . '', 
  and the us , for the most part , is culturally saying `` look at us look at us , look at our buildings and our future . '', 
  besides some disjointed `` yeah that 's where we came from '' why should i care about some individual country or region who will have less of a personal impact on my life than my favorite football team ? 
  if we wanted to control our sources of foreign oil , we 'd have invaded canada . 
  we 're not dumb , we just do n't care . 
  people would rather say , `` oh they 're just too dumb , '' than say , `` oh , we 're too irrelevant '', 
  he 's not pissed about anything with poland or hungary . 
  his wife is campaigning for president . 
  every public statement is crafted in someway to help her . 
  he 's not attacking poland or hungary , he 's attacking trump . 
  lonestar is 3 bucks for a 6 pack of tall boys . 
  what is cheaper ( and not beast ) ? 
  he hated the taste of freedom , cheap beer , ` comfy ' women , and comfortable boots .
