  it 's incredible how many people seem to forget these things . 
  for 17 trillion euros you could buy the united states and china . 
  i do n't like the idea of giving budgetary veto power to an official with no democratic legitimacy . 
  lobbying is a useful and necessary part of government . 
  without lobbying , there is no way for elected representatives and other government officials know about every single possible issue or interest . 
  the problem is not with lobbying per se , but how it is conducted , when money is exchanging hands , and if those with more influence are drowning out the voice of the little guys . 
  we were born too soon . 
  they were actually watching real time results of sweden again missing the euro convergence criteria . 
  absolutely . 
  it 's also particularly interesting given that most north african states are also members of the arab league , which many think could evolve into a supranational union in its own right . 
  i wonder how that would work . 
  the african union and union of south american nations were created explicitly to emulate the eu . 
  it 's already begun . 
  i 'm actually surprised it took 6 decades for this to happen . 
  better late than never though !, 
  ah yes , the eu 's iron fist imposing its will on the governments of europe that voluntarily joined it . 
  sounds a lot like europe circa 1940 . 
  i do n't know why , the article * is * about italy after all . 
  i would give it the power of legislative initiative and the ability to form the commission , as in a typical parliamentary system . 
  those two reforms would make the eu about as democratic as any of its member states . 
  `` let 's not try to emulate western countries , so that we also become successful countries . '', 
  - seemingly everyone in undeveloped and developing countries . 
  i still think the f-22 is the coolest modern fighter . 
  i was not aware . 
  thanks for informing me !, 
  some aspects of some cultures are at odds with the idea of self-determination . 
  arranged marriage is one of them . 
  it has no place in the west . 
  seems like a good first step to bring ukraine back onto the right track . 
  istanbul is unequivocally part of europe . 
  the european commission considers turkey a european country , as well as georgia , armenia , and azerbaijan . 
  that region of the world has always been a bit ambiguous . 
  how is it not ? 
  i doubt this will seriously alter the current dynamic among the great powers and syria , though it certainly does n't help russia 's or china 's positions . 
  i 've always liked the czech flag . 
  it 's simple , but unique enough to be one of those ones you never forget . 
  when do you guys apply for statehood ? 
  fantastic event . 
  did n't bulgaria 's gdp triple from 2000 to 2007 ? 
  i imagine that would help a lot . 
  it 's important to note that this is only for countries in which one of the countries does not have an embassy . 
   a person who admires europe ** or ** is in favour of participation in the european union . 
   a person who admires europe , europeans , ** or ** the european union, 
  the relationship is also dominated by the united states because it is so much larger and more powerful . 
  europe does n't have an analogous situation . 
  you do n't need to hope . 
  if the parliament has the power to introduce legislation , then it will have obtained a power that national parliaments have . 
  there is n't anything mischievous about it . 
  they 're already accountable to an electorate , they just do n't have the authority to do anything of real importance . 
  giving them the ability to do significant work increases the influence of the electorate in the eu . 
  it 's very simple , really , and nothing to be afraid of . 
  if anything , you should be wary of giving more power to the commission and the council of the european union , which are unelected bodies that have more influence in the eu than the parliament . 
  strengthening the parliament is not something to be afraid of at all . 
  it would be just like the house of commons , except that its constituency is more than 500 million people rather than 62 million . 
  i really do n't understand how anyone could be fearful of giving the parliament more power . 
  for god 's sake , it ca n't even do something as fundamental to legislation as introducing it . 
  giving the parliament more power = more democratic control . 
  it 's that simple . 
  by surrendering more sovereignty to a superstate , it saps power from the member states . 
  the member states are the reason why the eu has so many confederate structures . 
  it tries to keep every country happy to a degree by not completely trampling on their sovereignty . 
  the end result is an undemocratic system of prime ministers appointing commissioners and presidents on behalf of the people who did n't directly elect them . 
  federation will put more control in the hands of the people . 
  confederation is a terrible form of government , and has almost always failed in practice ( switzerland is the only developed country with a semi-confederate system , but even then it has a lot of federal elements ) . 
  the parliament is a nearly toothless organization because it ca n't introduce legislation . 
  give it the power to introduce legislation and all of a sudden the eu is more democratic . 
  the parliament is directly elected by the people . 
  democracy already exists in the eu . 
  the problem is that the parliament is weak . 
  it 's weak because the member state governments refuse to give it more power , because it will begin to sap power from national capitals . 
  there are two things that could be introduced that would bring the eu 's democratic credentials about up to par with those in western europe : 1 . 
  legislative initiative for the parliament and council of the european union 2 . 
  majority voting in both the parliament and the council of the european union these lack of these two things are the biggest obstacles to an almost parliamentary system of government at the european level . 
  the commission , the parliament , and the council of the eu do not have the authority to give grant the institutions these powers . 
  the burden of making the eu more democratic lies with national governments , not the eu itself . 
  they will ultimately require more treaty changes and treaties . 
  these are almost entirely in the hands of national governments , not the eu . 
  the eu is still far less than the sum of its parts . 
  until the european people realize that the eu will not become more democratic until they themselves become more pro-european ( allowing national politicians to act more boldly ) , then we 'll be stuck arguing about the democratic deficit for many more years . 
  the constant belief that the eu should n't be given more power until it is more democratic is utter nonsense . 
  the two go hand-in-hand . 
  eu officials want more democracy because it would legitimize their position and increase their power . 
  it 's in their own interests to advocate for democracy . 
  some of the strongest advocates of increased democratic control comes from those at the highest levels of the eu . 
  when barroso , van rompuy , and schulz talk about the need for increased democratic control , it is n't just lip service designed to placate the european electorate . 
  they genuinely want more democracy , but people like merkel , hollande , cameron , monti etc will not grant it to them because it will be at the expense of their own offices and their own countries ' sovereignty . 
  it 's easy to berate the eu for being undemocratic . 
  it 's harder to understand why it is n't and how it will get there . 
  most people who work for the eu , especially at higher levels do want to improve the eu . 
  the way to make it more democratic is to give it more power . 
  the way to give it more power is by forcing national governments to give up power . 
  unfortunately , national politicians are reluctant to do it because the public still do n't want to give brussels more power because they think it wo n't be democratic . 
  it 's a vicious cycle that can only be broken by educating the voters that the eu can only because more democratic if they surrender national sovereignty . 
  the british are by far the least willing country in the eu to give up sovereignty to brussels , for many reasons . 
  people should n't blame the eu for being undemocratic , they should blame europe 's national leaders and the european electorate . 
  they 're the ones with the real power . 
  regardless of whether you like him or not , barroso 's state of the union address last week provided the first step concrete toward federation : talking about it openly . 
  for the next several decades , this will be the goal of the european project . 
  now we are starting to hear more details . 
  and i ca n't wait for the rest of the british to realize that it 'll be worse to be outside of the eu than in it .
