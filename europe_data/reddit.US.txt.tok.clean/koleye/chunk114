  regarding germany as a state that is acting purely out of its own self interest does injustice to reality . 
  yes , a lot of what berlin is doing is for the betterment of germany , but to deny that they are willing to surrender a lot of national sovereignty to help cover the rest of europe 's ass when the uk is n't , is ludicrous . 
  why is it a bad thing for germany to exercise its power ? 
  it has been one of the world 's largest economies for decades , but has been sidelined by the existing intentional power paradigm into a regional power as if they still represent a threat to the status quo . 
  they are the largest member state of the eu and the eurozone , are increasingly the safest bet for bond investors , due to fiscal discipline and an efficient political system and political culture . 
  you may not like the fact that germany has the power that it does , but this is merely a natural outgrowth of confederacy , which the eu effectively is . 
  the big states will exercise more power than the smaller ones . 
  in the united states , california is by far the largest state , but it does not dominate politically or economically at any level because the united states is a federation . 
  for over 200 years , states have been surrendering powers to the federal government to the point where the federal government supersedes state powers in almost all aspects of society . 
  angela merkel has been pushing for more integration , and ultimately more federalization , despite opposition from within her own party , the csu , and their coalition partner the fdp . 
  federal europe will give germany a worse position of power than it has now . 
  it is both in and not in germany 's self-interest to encourage more integration . 
  by faciliating integration , germany lessens the risk of economic catastrophe for the entire continent , and ultimately the world , while simultaneously decreasing its relative power in the union . 
  i agree that a lot of what has been happening in regards to the troubled economies , specfically austerity packages , appears to be forced upon them by the sounder eurozone members , but again , this is how confederacy works . 
  federalization would decrease the power of the big states and increase the power of the smaller states so that they more accurately reflect population demographics . 
  the call for more integration is a vindication of the need to ditch petty nationalist tendencies to create a stronger , more prosperous europe for all europeans .

   oh , and getting together with the former satellites russia ripped of during the cold war ? 
  that 's not going to happen anytime , unless there 's another world war . 
  to be fair , the russian sfsr was the richest soviet republic , and paid for the bulk of spending in the other republics . 
  this is one of the ways yeltsin was able to undercut gorbachev , he reignited russian nationalism by emphasizing how the soviet union was a bad deal for russians . 
  well fuck . 
  i 'd imagine that as french interest rates continue to rise , the prospect of eurobonds becomes more attractive . 
  that 's absolutely right . 
  if it was n't evident before the iraq war , the `` special relationship '' is more one sided than anything else . 
  the most logical course of action for the uk would be to strengthen its ties to europe , and consolidate its role as a key state . 
  throughout the entire euro crisis , the uk has been as helpless to affect the eurozone as the united states . 
  if they were a part of the eurozone , they would have a much greater say in affairs that affect the entire eu , not just the eurozone . 
  espousing repatriation of powers from the eu is great demagoguery for the conservatives , but unless the uk wants to adopt an isolationist policy in the 21st century , which is incredibly unlikely , the most logical course of action is to integrate with continental europe . 
  germany , despite being one of the world 's largest economies for decades , has had very little power relative to other states , such as france , the uk , and china . 
  however , germany has defined a role of its own in the european union . 
  it is the most powerful political and economic state in the union , and is using that power to help shape the eu 's future , and role in the world . 
  the uk could really learn a thing or two from germany , especially since deteriorating sino-american relations will likely alienate the uk from asia moreso than the rest of the eu . 
   probably best for all of europe is the uk did join the eurozone and fully commit to the eu project . 
  that would easily be the biggest breakthrough in european politics in decades . 
  the uk has traditionally been the proverbial brake on integration , and is increasingly a thorn in the side of the eurozone . 
  the uk really has three choices for its role in the 21st century . 
  subdued role in international affairs , but a major player in the eu . 
  neither , and deal with decreasing relative power in international relations . 
  they ca n't have all 3 , and the longer they wait , the weaker their negotiating position and political clout and leverage . 
  my fortes are french , british , german and european politics and history , not italian , but here are my thoughts . 
  italy is less of a unified country than outsiders may believe , especially non-europeans . 
  regional pride does often trump national pride , though this is not uncommon in europe . 
  spain , the uk , belgium , and the balkans are all often consumed with regional pride and strife . 
  yet the state of these countries is far from that italy 's economic and political woes . 
  italy 's economy has grown at a snails pace for the past decade , and the entirety of the postwar era has been marked by political corruption . 
  i 'm not sure why exactly , but i 'm sure some other european redditors could give you a more comprehensive answer . 
  italy 's future , however , is far more likely to will be determined by the unfolding euro crisis more than anything else . 
  the most likely outcome is a higher degree of fiscal integration , possibly fiscal union , and more sovereignty surrendered to the eu . 
  ultimately , should the outcome be fiscal union , european identity among not only italians , but all europeans , will likely be strengthened , as a result of a return to growth and a greater focus and importance of pan-european economic and political issues . 
  in addition to what fforw and seefor posted , it 's important to remember that any damage done to the euro is damage done to the germany economy . 
  german ( european at-large , really ) economic interests insist that they have leverage over greek finances so that they do n't screw it up for everyone else . 
  this is the last thing the eu needs to deal with . 
  unfortunately , there is no `` grand strategy . '', 
  this is one of the problems with confederacy . 
  merkel and sarkozy have to deal with a supranational issue while being tied to their national electorates . 
  she is the head of government of the biggest state in the eu and the eurozone , and has to balance her duties to her own country with her duties to europe . 
  it is not surprising that euro-skepticism is on the rise amid all the troubles in the eurozone , so merkel definitely deserves praise for at least understanding that the solution is `` more europe , not less , '' something she had said fairly often . 
  she and sarkozy both know that the euro will ultimately fail in its current state unless fiscal union is adopted . 
  fiscal union would mean that the eu would be granted a lot of new powers at the expense of the member states . 
  convincing the germans that it is in their best interest to bail out the greeks and italians at the cost of their national sovereignty might well be the most difficult line to walk in modern european politics . 
  merkel has to walk this line ** very , very ** carefully . 
  she has to sell the idea of more federalization to an electorate that is not receptive to it , for a variety of reasons . 
  european leaders are incredibly afraid that by going too fast , they risk alienating their electorates from the european project altogether , producing the complete opposite result that they want . 
  the fact that merkel has survived this long displays just how effective she is . 
  europe is moving through uncharted waters , thus it is foolish to assume that it will be smooth sailing . 
  the general course is set upon federalization , but the speed is subject to change . 
  this is the first time in human history that a group of countries , with vastly different cultures , languages , religions , peoples , and a history of millenia of incessant warfare , competition , and rivalry are uniting under a common flag . 
  europe 's power and influence declined greatly during the second half of the 20th century , however , what it does now provides a blueprint for any future prospective supranational governments , perhaps even a global federal government , should it ever arise . 
  federalization of europe only increases european soft-power . 
  the eu has the potential to be a superpower in the same right as the united states and china . 
  if done right , it can show the world a peaceful model of cooperation , dialogue , and integration to which department of defense and the people 's liberation army are the antithesis . 
  two tickets to an early screening of a modern greek drama . 
  france , sweden , finland , and the uk all above italy ? 
  really ? 
  i would love nothing more . 
  it 's been done to rick [ santorum ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=santorum ) . 
  the at&t of heads of government . 
  what a sorry excuse for a human being . 
  his resignation can not come soon enough . 
  he 's referred to it as `` the ecommunist . '', 
  they 've pretty much stated that they hate him . 
  there 's no reason it has to be . 
  fiscal union will essentially mean that fiscal policy will be set by the commission and parliament , whose powers will have been expanded massively . 
  this does a lot to dispel the democratic deficit . 
  federalism and democracy are not mutually exclusive . 
  the united states , for example , could be argued to be more democratic than parliamentary system ( though i prefer the latter ) . 
  this is because the house and 1/3 of the senate are elected every 2 years , and the head of state and government , the president , is almost directly elected . 
  the reason that the eu is rife with undemocratic processes is because at its core , it is a confederacy . 
  pursuing federalism makes it far easier to resolve the democratic deficit . 
  this crisis really seems to have pushed merkel and sarkozy to the left on some issues . 
  the article states that sarkozy is beginning to echo mitterand . 
  merkel 's insistence that more europe is necessary , in addition to adopting some of the opposition 's policy points , e.g. 
  a federal minimum wage , underscores this shift . 
  it remains to be seen whether or not the socialists will win the french presidency next year , but i believe that regardless of the outcome , europe may find itself with a new mitterand and kohl , and a new european union . 
  it 's things like this that make me love the economist . 
  this is a very new development as well . 
  it has yet to be publicly discussed by sarkozy and merkel .
