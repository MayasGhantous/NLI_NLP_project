  i 'd imagine all of belgium . 
  i think much of this crisis was a result of lack of understanding of the european union and its history . 
  markets reactions to news from the eurozone regarding greece , ireland , portugal , spain , and italy were consistently volatile for much of the past two years . 
  that has finally seemed to subside . 
  the reason , i suggest , is that people within the financial sector and related industries have finally learned what the eu is about . 
  for the past two years , financial analysts and economists were warning about the impending greek withdrawl from the euro , as if it were so easy . 
  they failed to understand that the euro and the european union are not just economic endeavors . 
  they are political ones as well . 
  anyone familiar with the euro knew full well that it was a poorly designed currency from the start , but it was necessary in order to push integration further . 
  markets began to learn that economic interests were only one of countless factors at play in the euro crisis . 
  they have now seemed to learn that the political will for a greek exit never existed in the first place . 
  they failed to understand that if one country left the euro , not only would the euro lose all credibility , but the entire european project would have been jeopardized . 
  had more people in the financial sector understood the basics of postwar european history , this crisis would have been far more tame . 
  ah good . 
  after the mayan apocalypse fizzled out , i 've been wondering when the next one is . 
  imagine the bunga bunga parties in st. peter 's basilica . 
  where does turkey stand here then ? 
  northern cyprus is considered occupied territory , but is it considered a border dispute between turkey and cyprus as well ? 
  given the recent conflict between georgia and russia , georgia has had russia its mind far more than armenia has . 
  many of those who did n't see it as a threat or enemy now do . 
  armenia also has a huge diaspora in the west that georgia does n't have . 
  the money that this diaspora sends to armenia gives it significant influence in armenian society . 
  i completely forgot about moldova . 
  i can not say i know much about the country , other than that eu officials have generally considered it far too impoverished to consider a viable candidate . 
  norway will join sometime in the next 50 years . 
  the oil will start to dry up , and the benefits of being in an increasingly centralized eu will be too lucrative to pass up . 
  the balkans , turkey , and iceland are the main areas of focus for further expansion at present . 
  let 's assume that norway and switzerland ( and the various microstates ) remain outside the eu for the time being . 
  beyond these countries are belarus and ukraine , both of which are too heavily under russian influence to be a palatable expansion target , and there is no way russia itself will join the eu any time soon . 
  azerbaijan has made no desire to join the eu as well . 
  that leaves two countries : georgia and armenia . 
  both of these countries have made joining the eu explicit goals . 
  georgia is influenced by russia slightly more than armenia , but given its recent history with russia , it is more firmly in the pro-eu camp . 
  armenia is also a likely candidate , given that there is a substantial eu presence in the country , and the large , and more importantly , rich , armenian diasporas in the united states and france , would welcome its accession to the eu . 
  ultimately , it seems belarus , ukraine , and russia are the least likely to join the eu without some sort of massive reform and fundamental change in their political cultures . 
  beyond the current focus of expansion , armenia and georgia are the most likely to join . 
  it would be really weird to have turkey and armenia in the eu without their relationship improving significantly , however . 
  it will likely be one or the other for some time . 
  the eu will not expand beyond europe , even if some former colonies can be argued to be culturally and politically similar . 
  it 's simply too difficult and unnecessary . 
  i imagine that as the eu grows in power , it will eventually become a nato member itself . 
  it is a fairly inconsequential point though , as countries like ireland , sweden , and austria are neutral only in name . 
  it 's difficult to argue that a member state of the eu can be neutral . 
  the eu is a power bloc , and its member states have aligned themselves with it . 
  as long as the powerful member states continue to align themselves with nato , the neutral countries have effectively done so as well . 
  residents i would imagine . 
  laws banning flag burning are stupid laws . 
  for proof , see the soviet union . 
  cheer up estonia . 
  i consider you nordic . 
  i 'm aware of the distinction , but finland is part of sweden in this map , and this is the most relevant picture i have saved . 
  i think it 's more that the churchill floated the idea of the use . 
  now that it seems probable , the uk does n't like it . 
  i agree it is a weak cartoon though . 
  i think it 's depicting how britain used to be the most powerful european country , laying out a vision of europe that is now starting to take shape , but now the country fears the loss its influence and identity . 
  cameron is suggesting that the eu is going about things the wrong way , and that the eu would be better under british leadership .

  poland-lithuanian commonwealth ** big ** . 
   it was american nukes defending germany , norway , spain , portugal , etc. , not british and french ones . 
  whether nuclear or conventional , american military might insulated europe from war on the home front throughout the cold war . 
  britain 's nuclear arsenal has always been integrated into nato , whereas france 's has been more independent . 
  do n't forget that nato was n't only an alliance between america and european countries , but among european countries themselves as well . 
  even without america , why did n't the soviet union roll through the non-nato , free market economies of sweden and finland ? 
  in american absence , britain and france would not have tolerated a soviet invasion of west germany . 
  if you need proof , look at the two world wars . 
  germany represented a threat to both france and the uk , which finally put an end to their centuries of animosity and war . 
  the same thing could be said of germany during the cold war . 
  the soviets were always afraid of german war-making potential . 
  they continued to see a reunified germany as a threat . 
  the threat of the soviet union has also been attributed to the desire for further european integration . 
  a continent that had been at war with itself for thousands of years was never going to unify in a matter of years . 
   well , 1 is kind of a silly argument when europeans complain about how wrong it is for us to spend large amounts of money . 
  you ca n't say `` how stupid is it for you to spend all that money on military '' while admitting that you 'd be paying the same amount if we were n't doing it for you . 
  as for 2 , europeans were skimping during the cold war too . 
  nato strategy in europe amounted to `` meat shield the soviet invasion until the americans could show up . '', 
  nobody thought the europeans could mount a capable defense on their own , because they could n't . 
  even when there was an existential threat , europeans did n't have their shit together . 
  it 's a way they twist american logic . 
  many americans think they have to be the world 's police , whereas many europeans do n't think the world needs that kind of presence to begin with . 
  the us is absolutely insistent that it has to play that role . 
  if you think europeans were skimping during the cold war , you must think they 're absolute pussies now . 
  the royal navy was far bigger during the cold war ( our allied with a spine , as you put it ) . 
  europe is n't a unified continent . 
  they ca n't create an armed forces on the scale that the us can . 
  germany 's population is a quarter that of the us . 
  none of them can compete individually . 
  many have been advocating for common defense ( the french in particular , whom you deride as spineless ) . 
  unnecessarily insulting your friends and allies is exactly the kind of sentiment that so many people find arrogant about americans , and only perpetuates the bad reputation we get .
