  there 's no doubt though that his time in office helped largely to shape the course of european politics for decades afterwards , for better or for worse . 
  most eu states are members of nato , strong allies and major trading partners of the us . 
  what happens in europe has profound ramifications for america and vice versa . 
  the reason why this specific piece of information has made the news is because of the special relationship between the us and the uk , which is stronger than any other alliance america has with a european country . 
  european integration began largely because of these guys : [ robert schuman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_schuman ) [ jean monnet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean_monnet ) [ paul-henri spaak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul-henri_spaak ) [ konrad adenauer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konrad_adenauer ) [ alcide de gasperi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcide_de_gasperi ) [ johan willem beyen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_willem_beyen ) charles de gaulle was less involved with the actual creation of the ecsc and eec , but he committed france to integration , and was instrumental in repairing franco-german relations . 
  the eu was created under its current name in 1992/1993 as a result of the maastricht treaty , which was the brainchild of [ fran\u00e7ois mitterand ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitterand ) and [ helmut kohl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helmut_kohl ) . 
  that 's the plan . 
  european public policy . 
  obama has said that he prefers the uk to stay in the eu . 
  i only know one american expat . 
  he moved to london after completing his undergraduate degree in the us . 
  he wanted to study law , but did n't want to jump through all the hoops in the us . 
  he did another undergraduate degree at ucl and studied law afterwards . 
  he 's been a lawyer and lived in london for 20 years now . 
  he says he would do it again in a heartbeat , even though he spent a longer time in school than most . 
  i 'm starting graduate school in the fall in london myself , so i can only speak to why i want to leave the us : i 'm a europhile , and my academic and professional credentials are better suited for a career related to the eu than anything i could find in the us outside of the state department or think tanks . 
  can definitely tell this was drawn by an irishman . 
  portugal is of strong !, 
  independent northern ireland , just to piss everyone off . 
  oh man , you were n't joking . 
  scandinavia looks really good though . 
  but that 's what makes it fun !, 
  there are so many islands everywhere so i figured i 'd just throw in a few more just to be sure . 
  try canada , it 's impossible . 
  suck ups . 
  what does this mean ? 
  my understanding is that the technical definition of a recession is at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth . 
  we 'll have to see how the first quarter of 2013 goes . 
  i guess they 'd have to change the name of northern ireland . 
  [ but they have all that oil money . 
  stock exchanges are n't the only factor in determining the financial significance of a city . 
  toronto is nowhere near the level of importance to the global economy as london or new york . 
  the uk could hold on to london as a major financial center if it enacted looser financial laws that were more attractive than those offered on the continent . 
  we will see how this financial transaction tax will affect london and the continent 's financial centers . 
  ahh !, 
  i meant as percentage of each country 's budget . 
  .75 % of gdp would be sweet . 
  britain has london , arguably the world 's financial capital . 
  canada has no analogous city . 
  canada would be a lot more influential if new york was one its cities . 
  the eu without britain has paris and frankfurt , which are minuscule in comparison to london . 
  ** pros and cons for britain ** pro : the only significant pro is that it leaves britain to govern itself in nearly all aspects . 
  whether or not one sees this as a pro generally correlates to nationalism and patriotism . 
  to nationalists , it is an important issue . 
  to non-nationalists , it is not . 
  cons : nearly all aspects of britain 's political power , reputation and economy would suffer . 
  ** pros and cons for the eu ** pro : an eu without britain removes the most significant obstacle to further integration . 
  cons : the eu loses relevance and power in foreign , security , defense , and economic matters , but only slightly . 
  it also creates the potential for a race to the bottom between the eu and britain , as britain could undermine eu integration efforts in order to siphon capital and investment . 
  i truly understand why many brits are up in arms about the eu and how they think it does n't work for them . 
  the problem is that the only coherent argument that comes from the anti-eu camp is nationalist rhetoric over the concept of sovereignty . 
  i am not a nationalist in any sense of the word . 
  to me , that argument carries absolutely no weight . 
  britain should be governed by the british means nothing to me , because i think that europe governed by europeans is a much more potent force in domestic and international affairs . 
  i do n't see nationalism as a product of rationality . 
  it is an artificial construct that serves only to impede human interaction at all levels . 
  it is unnecessary and cumbersome in the modern age . 
  i do n't know for sure if britain will end up leaving the eu , but i do know that if it does leave , the british public will come to see it as a massive mistake . 
  i sincerely hope britain makes the right choice for their sake and europe 's sake . 
  for shame . 
  i 'd really love to see nasa and esa merge and create an international space agency , where each member state contributes at least .75 % of their gdp . 
  we could be on mars in no time . 
  i think cameron , as well as many tories and british citizens miss one of the major points of the eu : solidarity . 
  a major reason things are coordinated in brussels is to prevent countries from racing to the bottom to beat each other to extra capital or what have you . 
  solidarity ensures that the quality of life and work environments and standards improve for all europeans . 
  it 's not wrong that cameron wants a better deal for the eu , since every country wants the eu to serve their interests as much as possible . 
  the problem is that many british seem to have the view that they can have their cake and eat it to . 
  part of being a member of the eu means having to give rather than receive at times . 
  that being said , i welcome the referendum , since in light of recent polling and the ample time for the eurozone to recover , it seems that the public will vote to stay in the eu . 
  the eu should not give in to british demands to renegotiate a `` better deal '' for britain , lest it is prepared to do it for all the member states , and suffer further obstacles to and reversals in integration . 
  the eu already regrets the relationship it gave with switzerland , to give something similar to britain would endanger the well-being of the other member states . 
  unfortunately , the debate over europe in britain will take at least four years to go away . 
  that is the sad part about all of this . 
  no , but the two situations are not perfectly analogous . 
  london is in a different country , whereas texas is part of the same country . 
  if an american president were to moan about how much they were being taxed , it would probably be met with public vitriol . 
  it would seem incredibly petty for someone of such stature . 
   secondly , most predictions at the moment see another coalition government coming to power after 2015 . 
  the polls for the past year or so have indicated a massive labour majority . 
  with the lib-dems facing almost certain destruction , and the tories with such a bad record , it seems that labour will coast to victory unless something big happens in the next 2 years . 
  i do n't know much about french presidential politics , but in the us , a move like this would be considered highly disrespectful . 
  former presidents generally do not get involved in political discourse after they leave office , and particularly do not publicly oppose their successor . 
  i 'd love for some french insight into this matter if anyone can provide it . 
  i knew i had seen this video somewhere before . 
  such is life in europe . 
  do n't worry about the ardennes bro . 
  when were spain and portugal unified ? 
  i 've always seen the commissioners as akin to secretaries or ministers in a government . 
  i 'm not sure why anyone would see them in any other light . 
  i 've been to hawaii several times . 
  it still feels like america , but it 's obvious that it 's also different , but not really so much more different than california and vermont are from each other . 
  the main differences are its physical nature and separation from the rest of the country . 
  i see it as a state just like any other , with its own unique qualities and quirks . 
  britain appears the same way to me within a larger europe , except that each european countries characteristics are more pronounced because of their thousands of years of history and linguistic and cultural differences . 
  if the us ever became a member state of the eu , the eu would reflect american interests more than any other member state , both by the fact that it would be the largest member , and by american attitude and power . 
  the linguistic barrier between britain and france is surely not any more inconvenient than between spain and finland , for example , yet they remain committed to the eu . 
  every country is going to feel different * because * they 're different countries . 
  expecting anything less is odd . 
  most of my ancestry goes back to the british isles as well , and i like the relationship that the anglosphere has constructed , but i do n't think the uk as a fully fledged member of the eu will change much . 
  bilateral relations between the us and the uk will undoubtedly weaken as the eu assumes more prominence , but the cultural and societal exchange between the uk and the us will not change at all .
