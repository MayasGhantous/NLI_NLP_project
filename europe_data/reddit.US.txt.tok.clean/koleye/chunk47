  nowhere did i suggest otherwise . 
  i also did n't say the neo-nazis were murderers . 
  i 'm not sure why you felt the need to engage in emotional one-upmanship . 
  are you completely oblivious to the pushback on safe spaces and thin-skinned nature of the left ? 
  [ this op-ed ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/opinion/will-the-left-survive-the-millennials.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=homepage&amp;clicksource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;wt.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region ) is literally on the front page of the nyt 's website right now . 
  furthermore , those who argue that the results of the brexit vote should be ignored argue against direct democracy , not for authoritarianism . 
  we do n't have a multiparty system like you do , so the republican party acts as a catch-all for right-wing politics , including neo-nazis . 
  ~ 85 % of britain 's total trade is with the eu or countries with which the eu has a trade agreement or is negotiating one . 
  the eu alone is around 45 % of britain 's total trade . 
  i agree that these issues should have been taken more seriously years ago , but i 'm pretty sure the right has been in power in most western countries for most of the 21st century . 
  this is true for the us , france , and germany , at the very least . 
  in 2013 , obama signed a bill into law that reinstated secret service protection for life for presidents who served after 1997 . 
  how likely is it that all of the countermeasures at the rafale 's disposal would be enough to avoid two or three missiles ? 
  i read this somewhere on this site this week : `` fascism has been gone just long enough for people to forget how bad it is . '', 
  the vitriol , spread of misinformation , and overt flirtation with authoritarianism among the alt-right/ukip/fn / afd is incredibly disconcerting . 
  even worse is how blind they are to it . 
  i 'm beginning to think that this was how democrats felt during the early 1930s . 
  le pen is n't anywhere near as ignorant as trump is on policy and global affairs . 
  that 's what makes le pen scarier , in my mind . 
  to the mod writing the flair on this thread : the bill has not yet passed the senate . 
  because the f-22 destroys the rafale before it is seen . 
  and i imagine those poverty statistics are inflated by london 's higher percentage of immigrants who tend to work lower wage jobs . 
  in the english language , we do n't refer to the americas as america , but i believe they do in spanish . 
  i assume the same is true in portuguese . 
  it would be even more obvious if they rigged the votes in moscow and st. petersburg . 
  come to think of it , i 've never actually seen anyone dunk a donut into their coffee . 
  while true , the point is that there are two examples of armed conventional conflict between nuclear powers . 
  so long as both sides refrain from escalation and do not pose existential threats to one another , conventional conflicts are entirely possible . 
  people get too caught up in cold war thinking and imagine any two nuclear powers as stand-ins for the us and ussr . 
  the us and ussr were existential threats to one another and neither had a convincing enough conventional arms superiority at any point . 
  for them , nuclear weapons leveled the playing field . 
  people also mistakenly conflate mad with a nuclear deterrent . 
  north korea , for example , has too small an arsenal and too rudimentary weapons and delivery systems to achieve mad with the us . 
  but even a handful of atomic bombs are a deterrent because they make an american invasion of north korea more costly . 
  this is why people really should n't brush off tension between the us and china in the south china sea . 
  china is not an analogue for the soviet union . 
  the us and china are not existential threats to one another , and there is zero reason for either side to escalate to the use of nuclear weapons over a couple of uninhabited shoals and islets . 
  scholars and analysts often compare this tension to that between britain and germany circa 1913 rather than the us and ussr circa 1960 . 
  the borders of europe are also not universally agreed upon . 
  there are people who do n't think georgia and turkey are part of it . 
  there are also people who believe that russia , though part of its territory and most of its population are in europe , should be considered as wholly separate because of the political distance between it and the vast majority of the rest of the continent . 
  furthermore , the eu has something like two-thirds of europe 's population and is its most important political organization . 
  it has a better claim to the name europe than anything else . 
   and eu is shorter than europe . 
  so why use incorrect name ? 
  uk is shorter than britain , but we still use both . 
  language is n't logical . 
  when you point out that europe \u2260 eu , i 'm immediately reminded of people from latin america pointing out that america \u2260 usa . 
  sure , it 's correct on a technical level , but most people understand what it means based on the context . 
  do most canadians perceive your political class that way ? 
  i know pedants love to point this out , but we live in a world where europe is increasingly used as a synonym for the eu . 
  when most people think of europe , they think of france , germany , and italy , not norway , iceland , and san marino . 
  my condolences to the norways , icelands , and san marinos of the world . 
  yea , paris has been trying to get a summer games for at least a decade now . 
  britain is a strong , sovereign country who do n't need no man . 
  i wish brexit only applied to people such as yourself . 
  yes , i 'd avoid any area where there are englishmen from outside london . 
  the us olympic committee ( usoc ) initially endorsed boston over washington , dc . 
  boston then pulled out , leaving usoc with la. 
  this would leave budapest , paris , and los angeles as the only contenders . 
  after the scandals and difficulties with sochi and rio , i think the ioc will be more inclined to give the olympics to a developed country that has hosted them before . 
  it 'll likely be paris or la , either of which would become the second city after london to host the summer games three times . 
  garbage `` article . '', 
  i dislike whatever nationality you are . 
  just swap bosnia and britain overnight . 
  no one will notice . 
  i 'm not sure about the us paralympic team , but the us olympic team does not receive public funding , it 's all private money . 
  i would not be surprised if the same is true of the paralympic team , in which case funding would be pretty sparse since no one cares about it . 
   norway a-ha i will fight anyone who suggests take on me is n't the greatest song ever made . 
  i do n't know what education is like in the fine arts , but in ir/history/poli sci you do n't read textbooks at a postgraduate level . 
   ** we ** voted to leave . 
  obviously ** we 're ** fine with letting the eu get on with doing eu things without us . .  ** i ** do n't really care let 's play spot the difference . 
  do n't brush off the fact that there 's been a huge debate in your country over what brexit means for your participation in the single market . 
  which is how the eu works more often than not , but britain gets upset when its in the minority . 
  eu things like not giving the uk access to the single market without accepting free movement ? 
  because i think i heard somewhere that you guys are a bit upset about that one . 
   4 ) i also have a degree , specifically in fine art , but that does n't make me more informed about raphael than his mistress was . 
  i live in the uk , i know about our politics and the discontent of the people . 
  `` i 'm visiting a museum , i know about raphael . '', 
  it does n't work like that . 
  you are n't even the most powerful country on your own continent . 
  germany has a larger economy , russia has a more powerful military , and france is your economic and military equal . 
  the eu is one of the organizations that the uk has at its disposal to enhance its global power . 
  leaving it will reduce its options to exert influence in other parts of the world . 
  in the european council and european commission . 
  the council of the eu has weighted voting . 
  malta has 6 seats in the parliament and the uk has 73 . 
  the isle of wight has had a constituency five times larger than the smallest constituency for at least 15 years . 
  why are n't you foaming at the mouth with rage at this undemocratic part of your political system ? 
  you have a parliamentary system of government like most eu member states . 
  labour is not fundamentally different from other social democratic parties on the continent . 
  the tories are only slightly to the right of most center-right parties . 
  both of your parties would fit in nicely in the us 's democratic party . 
  that 's how close together they are . 
  during the cold war , most nato members spent 2 % of gdp on defense . 
  estonia , poland , and greece all exceed 2 % at present . 
  furthermore , the 2 % is a suggested target , not an enforceable requirement . 
  the us is still the only nato member that exceeds the target by a significant margin . 
  the uk is nearly incapable of sustaining a serious military operation without american support . 
  nor is any other nato member for that matter .
