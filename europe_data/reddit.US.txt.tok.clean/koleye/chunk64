  ** but that 's what i was saying ? 
   the shape of that , between ethno-centric reactionaries and enlightment humanists is yet to be determined i think this is the biggest social issue on both sides of the atlantic at the moment . 
  i 'm not sure how it will be addressed successfully . 
  i agree with everything you wrote . 
  a lot of ir academics , particularly americans and those on the right , accost europe for being too inward looking . 
  robert kagan immediately comes to mind . 
  i believe he wrote just prior to the iraq war that europe lives in a post-modern bubble that no other region on the planet does , where hard power is a thing of the past , and deliberation , cooperation , and integration are the pillars of modern politics . 
  the most common argument against this has been that the uk and france maintain significant hard power capabilities . 
  the problem with that is both of those countries are overly reliant on their allies , whether its the us , nato , or the eu , and generally do not take unilateral action , unlike the world 's bigger powers , like the us , russia , and china . 
  kagan is a huge neocon , so i do n't agree with him on almost anything , but i do think this was particularly insightful . 
  are you speaking about romania or the eu , because i believe that 's true for both . 
  exactly . 
  the eu is the dominant political force in europe . 
  everything that happens on the continent revolves around it now . 
  yes , they always paint france as being on the brink of economic catastrophe because it does n't adhere to economic liberalism . 
  i say this as an avid reader of the economist . 
  fake news , am i right ? 
  no , jingoism is a kind of aggressive nationalism . 
  even something as seemingly inoffensively nationalist as believing in american exceptionalism only produces a sense of superiority that can be harmful to cooperation with other countries , obstruct rational thought , and prevent solving collective action problems . 
  the fact that so many people are completely blind to the horrors of extreme nationalism amazes me . 
  that europe has been more peaceful and prosperous in those 60 years than it was at any point in time before that ? 
  oh wait , that one 's true . 
  i 'm familiar with the differences between the two . 
  i just do n't think giving up a little bit of your sovereignty so you do n't give up a lot of your sovereignty in exchange for participation in the single market is worth it , particularly when you also get no say in the governing process . 
  slightly related : i honestly do n't understand why anyone would support eea membership for their own country . 
  it 's a shit deal . 
  if the single market is attractive enough to want to be a part of it , then go all the way so you can influence how it 's run . 
  same with the empire state building . 
  it went dark after the paris attacks and lit up with the belgian flag 's colors after the brussels attacks . 
  you should have been born in the 19th century . 
  you 're right , but it 's the closest any two nato members have come to blows . 
  the fact that there is both historical and ongoing animosity between turkey and greece should also be factored in . 
  there is no current animosity between the uk and spain , unless you want to count this completely fabricated issue . 
  yes . 
  [ eurobarometer from spring 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_citizen_en.pdf ) do you see yourself as : ** nationality only ** * uk - 64 % * hungary - 46 % ** nationality and european ** * uk - 30 % * hungary - 44 % ** european and nationality ** * uk - 2 % * hungary - 8 % ** european ** * uk - 1 % * hungary - 2 % [ eurobarometer from spring 2015 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb83/eb83_citizen_en.pdf ) do you see yourself as : ** nationality only ** * uk - 64 % * hungary - 37 % ** nationality and european ** * uk - 31 % * hungary - 51 % ** european and nationality ** * uk - 2 % * hungary - 10 % ** european ** * uk - 1 % * hungary - 2 %, 
  not nearly to the extent they do in the uk . 
  militarism and nationalism alive and well in britain . 
  this is why you never fit in well in the eu . 
  hey look , more unnecessary militarism over a complete non-issue . 
  he 's alluding to the fact that the turkish invasion of cyprus did n't lead to war between turkey and greece , despite both being nato members . 
  i just finished the first season . 
  it 's a really pretty show , but the acting is just terrible all around . 
  i ca n't get past it . 
  that 's a lot of asshole in one picture . 
  saudi arabia has a massive defense budget , but there is widespread consensus that their armed forces are garbage . 
  i was saying that germany would not be like this . 
  what is the point of this comment other than to project your own sense of ultra-nationalism ? 
  at first i only saw the thumbnail , so i thought you were making a joke that boris johnson was theresa may . 
  then i opened the article . 
  good lord , that is a fucking funny caricature . 
  no , i understand that . 
  germany is not in the same league as saudi arabia regarding the efficacy of its defense budget . 
  then downvote it and move on . 
   immigrants rape swedish women this is also a less innocuous topic than brexit and i suspect would violate sub rules . 
  it 's a cartoon . 
  calm down . 
  there 's no rule here that says discussion must be equally balanced between pro- and anti-brexit . 
  that 's what robots are for . 
  at least they do n't judge you . 
  germany is raising its defense budget and is arguably the biggest `` freeloader '' in nato , given how much more powerful it would be with 2 % spending . 
  no one expects the spanish veto 's condition !, 
  you not funny . 
  we send to gulag . 
  `` delivery of your scottish referendum letter to westminster was unsuccessful because no one was home to sign it . 
  we will attempt delivery again on the next business day , otherwise please reschedule delivery . '', 
  hey now , let 's not let the uk off the hook . 
   gon na play the devil 's advocate here . 
  obama tried to be constructive and diplomatic about this issue and it did n't really bring the desired results . 
  the 2014 nato wales summit was the one where they all reaffirmed their pledge to meet the 2 % spending goal . 
  you 'll notice that a lot of member states have been increasing their defense budgets accordingly . 
  `` your representative owes you , not his industry only , but his judgment ; and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion . '', 
  - edmund burke i do n't think the referendum should have been held in the first place , but since it was , i think the only way forward is to implement the people 's will . 
  if enough people really wanted to leave the eu , but the traditional parties resisted it , they should have organized a new political party and run on that platform . 
  that is exactly what was happening with ukip vis-a-vis the tories ( mostly ) . 
  the referendum was called to solve an intraparty conflict . 
  while i completely agree that every nato member should be meeting the 2 % target , trump 's way of going about this is not constructive and undiplomatic . 
  this is just another public display of the white house 's amateurish approach to governing . 
  skilled diplomats would be doing this behind closed doors . 
  airing your grievances with your allies publicly only serves to embolden adversaries . 
   this is an empty threat . 
  the us can not afford to do that , too much is at stake for their own interests . 
  i would n't underestimate this administration 's stupidity or maliciousness . 
  do you think federalists give a shit if britain builds an american theme park ? 
   the eu is nowhere near as powerfully tied together as the united states is correct . 
   and never will be 100 years ago , the current franco-german friendship and alliance would be absolutely unthinkable . 
  never say never . 
   one of your states voted to leave and is facing tough negotiations that state having the most consistently eurosceptic population for decades and having fallen victim to populist and nationalist lies . 
  britain has always had little leverage going in to these negotiations . 
  the eu is an economic titan compared to the uk . 
  this is obvious . 
   and these `` independence movements '' in us states are nonexistent . 
  they 're not nonexistent , but they 're massively overstated . 
  they have been fringe movements since the end of the civil war . 
  this is exactly what we said would happen because of brexit , that the nationalists and brexiteers would blame everything that goes wrong with brexit on the eu anyway . 
  if scotland leaves - eu 's fault . 
  if british economy does poorly - eu gave us a bad deal . 
  they do n't want to admit they made a mistake . 
  comment written in english . 
  confirmed . 
  change la to california and this is how i see the us too .
