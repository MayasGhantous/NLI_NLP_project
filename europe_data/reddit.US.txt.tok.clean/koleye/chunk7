  but the entire argument for leaving the eu is to take back sovereignty . 
  the norwegian model means that brussels would still make laws for britain , but britain would n't be allowed participate in the parliament , council of ministers , or european council . 
  the norwegian model would take more sovereignty away from britain than the current situation . 
  again , i understand that the norwegian people support their relationship with the eu . 
  that does n't mean it makes any sense . 
   there was an interesting study on happiness by coincidence : oecd better life index [ 1 ] you 'll see the countries highest in the rating are also eea/efta members . 
  i merely point it out that the norwegians appear very happy with eea and other things besides . 
  correlation is n't causation , and i have a very hard time believing that not being in the eu is what makes icelanders , norwegians , and the swiss so happy . 
  besides , there are several eu member states not far behind them in that ranking . 
   is n't that something of an admission that the eu needs a plan b ? 
  it means i would enjoy watching the british government scrambling to hobble together a new and messier relationship with the eu , and a majority of the british public eventually coming to the realization that they made a mistake . 
  hear , hear !, 
  you 're absolutely right about imperial preference . 
  my mistake . 
  i do seem to recall some sort of preferential trade framework between the uk and the dominions , however . 
   a country would have more control , notwithstanding other actors , if it was a member of a free trade bloc rather than the current customs union and was free , therefore , to pursue it 's own trade deals , even with less bargaining power . 
  the problem is that trade deals ** are ** conducted with other actors . 
  britain ca n't just make a list of its own trade proposals and have china sign off on them . 
  it 's a two way street , and the bargaining power is firmly in china 's camp , and increasingly so . 
  i think it boils down to the fact that britain is used to giving the orders , not receiving them . 
  i 'm aware . 
  when i wrote `` they still get british money , '' i was referring to the eu as a whole , not france . 
  i was also referring to the economic policy differences between the uk and france . 
   if the norway option is '' `` terrible '' '' yet it 's better in terms of : democracy , sovereignty , cost-saving , more influence and is in the direction the uk actually wants to go away from the federalism of the use and towards a global future , than the eu currently is how is having to transpose most eu law into national law without any form of political representation in the lawmaking process more democratic than britain being a full member of the eu ? 
   norwegians 7/10 would vote to stay in eea than the eu and have numerous `` opt-outs '' just because the public wants something does n't make it right . 
  democracy is n't some sort of trump card you can use to invalidate an argument . 
  democracy is far from perfect . 
  norway 's two main political parties , labour and conservative , are actually in favor of full eu membership because they do n't like that norway has to transpose eu law without any sort of political representation . 
   switzerland was able to get a referendum for it 's people via direct democracy as another example of the benefits of outlier relationships and not only that proves you can make deals with the eu out of the eu that are better over the long-term . 
  see `` see '' above . 
  the outcome of the recent swiss referendum remains to be seen . 
  the eu may very well use punitive measures against switzerland since it is in violation of one of the core principles of the single market . 
  at this point , the in vs. out debate has become so tedious and frustrating that i honestly would n't mind watching what a trainwreck a british exit would be . 
  go ahead and support squandering your country 's future for all i care . 
  every part of the developed world is in relative decline because they used to represent the majority of the global economy . 
  they do not any longer . 
  even the us , britain 's closest ally and a superpower , is in an undeniable relative decline . 
  the parts of the world that are gaining in relative power generally do n't share the same worldview as the uk or other developed countries . 
  the uk sees eye to eye with other european countries more than it does with china , india , or brazil . 
  no , but you 're the biggest and most influential of them . 
  it does n't matter how much openness and sovereignty britain has . 
  100 years ago britain was a big shot because it was richer than nearly every other country . 
  that 's no longer the case . 
  britain is a small country whose relative decline is far from over . 
  the same is true for every single european country , like it or not . 
   i know a degree of protection is the norm , i just do n't feel an economic policy built around keeping competition from asia out instead of doing what they should be doing and competing on quality and value is sustainable . 
  in order for competition to be based on quality and value , all the players must play by the same rules . 
  this is from the commission 's website regarding the eu 's concerns with china :  the eu 's concerns include :  industrial policies and non-tariff measures in china which may discriminate against foreign companies  a strong degree of government intervention in the economy , resulting in a dominant position of state-owned enterprises , and unequal access to subsidies and cheap financing  inadequate protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in china a free trade deal with china is completely out of the question because europe and china play by different rules . 
  many sectors of the european economy would be wrecked through a fta between the eu and china because they would not be able to compete with chinese economic policies and business practices . 
  the recent row between the two over china 's heavy subsidization of solar panels and subsequent dumping in the eu is a perfect example . 
  one of the eu 's main functions is to provide ** uniform ** rules governing trade among its member states . 
  this serves to level the playing field among the member states , making competition fairer than it is with countries outside of the eu . 
  this is a perfect reason why the eu is a good thing , and serves the purpose that you yourself want to see . 
  beyond that , the eu is negotiating a free trade deal with asean , india , and a number of other asian nations . 
  i do n't understand where you 're getting this ridiculous information that the eu is an unwieldy , protectionist behemoth . 
  european nations tend to be the most strong supporters of the current global paradigm , including the imf , world bank , and wto . 
   how can one maintain a coherent policy in trade and economic policy when you do n't control your own trade policy ? 
  name one country that does . 
  trade and economic policies are entirely dependent on which actors you are looking at . 
  trade between the us and canada is very different from trade between new zealand and south korea . 
   we 've left our traditional trading partners in australia and new zealand in particular , who despite being so far away , exported a considerable amount of agricultural products in particular here that was because of imperial preferences , which was a protectionist policy . 
  for britain , there is no way that buying an apple from new zealand will be cheaper than one from france in a free trade system . 
  in a global order built on free trade , britain 's biggest trading partners are always going to be in europe . 
  in one built on protectionism ( e.g. 
  the late 19th and early 20th century ) , britain 's biggest trading partners were in the empire . 
   i 've got up a list of eu free trade agreements , and it 's mostly non-eu european states with a few other places scattered around . 
  that 's because creating ftas between the eu and other countries prior to the lisbon treaty was a complicated matter . 
  the lisbon treaty gave the eu a legal personality , giving it the ability to sign treaties . 
  seeing as the lisbon treaty is only five years old , i 'd say the eu is doing a damn fine job at pursuing ftas . 
  the us , often lauded in the uk as a bastion of free trade and liberalism , only has ftas with 20 countries at the moment . 
  while britain has been the proverbial brake on integration since it joined , it does bring some valuable qualities to the eu : its liberal tradition , widespread diplomatic network , its relationship with the us , as well as a powerful and sophisticated military . 
  the eu would undoubtedly suffer from a british exit to some degree . 
  the problem i have is that britain has never been a country to just sit back and mind its own business . 
  it has a very long history of being intimately involved in global affairs . 
  stepping away from the eu would only serve to make the country more irrelevant in these matters . 
  i think britain has a lot to offer the world , and would be both upset and ashamed if britain decided to pack it all up and call it quits . 
   the main economic argument revolves around the fact that the world is bigger than europe and being tied into a protectionist bloc does n't help us the uk is a much smaller market than the eu . 
  it has less bargaining power and leverage in trade negotiations than the eu . 
  calling the eu a protectionist bloc is disingenuous . 
  every country and trade bloc protects certain sectors of its economy to a certain extent . 
  for example , the us and the eu are both heavily protective of their agricultural sector . 
  furthermore , the eu has among the most comprehensive and numerous free trade agreements of any country/economic bloc in the world . 
  exactly . 
  russia is actually building its own spaceport now . 
  not to mention kazakhstan is already signing up for the eurasian union . 
  the norway option is a terrible choice for britain given that the vast majority of the argument for leaving the eu is based on recovering lost sovereignty . 
  i 'm sure many other countries would love britain to opt for that model ( the french in particular ) , as it would mean they still get british money without having to have them in the room . 
  regarding the `` flexcit '' that you linked , a lot of what he wants from the eu would require the consent of the 27 other member states . 
  britain has almost no leverage in the eu on the issue of reform . 
  why would the other member states agree to change many of the eu 's core aspects in order to appease the one most eurosceptic member state ? 
   there 's no denying that the eu-political-project would loose a lot of prestige with the brexit event . 
  not at all . 
  everyone is aware that britain was never an eager participant in the european project anyway . 
  it 's not like there are any other countries that want to leave the eu . 
  the eu has successfully fostered reconciliation and peace in europe . 
  the argument for staying in the eu comes from the brain . 
  the argument for leaving the eu comes from the heart . 
  ultimately the choice for britons will come down to pragmatism vs. patriotism . 
  i can feel the free healthcare flowing through me . 
  i think i 'm going to be sick .
