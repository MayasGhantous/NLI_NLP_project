  i do n't . 
  i support a two round election system for president like france 's . 
  i do n't think anyone should be able to win the presidency without the consent of a simple majority . 
  is that why the gop 's congressional leadership finally accepted the findings of the ic regarding russian action to help elect trump ? 
  is it really that far-fetched to think that russia is intentionally destabilizing the west ? 
  you 're right . 
  they should have lied more . 
  yes , but people are upset because 54 % of votes cast in the election were for people other than donald trump . 
  imagine if brexit passed with 46 % of the vote . 
  the public outrage is completely justified . 
  most americans do not like donald trump or what he is doing . 
  so no source then . 
  the main geopolitical goal behind tpp was to prevent china from creating a parallel international system in asia , as evidenced by their spearheading of institutions such as the asian infrastructure investment bank , which duplicates the function of the imf/world bank . 
  redundant international organizations and sino-centric regional agreements and systems dilute american influence and power in the region . 
  tpp would have either forced china to either isolate itself from or acquiesce to an american-led regional economic system . 
  killing tpp was one of the dumbest geopolitical moves the us has consciously made in recent memory . 
  we get almost nothing out of this , while china has been given an opportunity to expand their influence in the region that they do not intend to squander . 
  for the record , i voted for bernie in the primaries , and i 100 % disagree with his opposition to ftas , for both economic and geopolitical reasons . 
  the opposition to ftas among the populist left and right is completely misguided . 
  he 's almost assuredly a troll . 
  his recent comments are pro-trump and he recycles / pol / and t_d buzz words and talking points . 
  he is n't , from what i can gather , but he and the state department have been sidelined by this administration thus far . 
  it 's not surprising , given that republican presidents have historically been mistrustful of the state department . 
  i suspect the anti-eu rhetoric was coming primarily from bannon and flynn . 
  manafort may also have had a hand in that back when he was his campaign manager . 
  he 's right that the eu should be able to achieve more politically without the eu , but likely wrong that the eu 's economic prospects are rosier without the uk . 
  the uk has been the primary brake on political integration for as long as it 's been a member . 
  on the biggest issues , the uk often acted as a counterweight to france , and germany would often occupy the middle . 
  france has always been one of the biggest proponents of deeper integration . 
  with the uk gone , french influence will grow in the eu . 
  integration in the 1950s and 1960s was incredibly rapid relative to the past two decades , largely because of the franco-german alliance . 
  fuck yeah , dogs . 
  i 'd be cool with either la or paris . 
  no , they hate the sense of superiority that seems to emanate from its media and political class and many then conflate it with the country and its people . 
  i do n't hate the uk or its people . 
  i hate britain 's current political culture , and i hate the fact that the uk is leaving the eu , but i 'm also not interested in having any country bend over backward to placate the uk . 
   an irishman has 0 in common with a bulgarian yet somehow a federal union is going to form out of them based on your comment history , i have close to zero in common with you and yet we 're both citizens of the same federal republic . 
  the eu is already a fledgling superpower , and it has n't been a sudden development . 
  it 's been happening since the 1950s . 
  yes . 
  it 's his job , so i think it 's fair to say a great deal . 
   i find them just as repugnant as neo-nazis and islamists who want to murder ethnic jews . 
  hold up man , a degree of nuance is warranted here . 
  til our allies are not allowed to criticize us . 
  i do n't know why the future of european defense is usually presented as a choice between a european armed forces or greater nato cooperation . 
  i 'd like to see a unified european armed forces as a fully integrated nato member . 
  alright , i can see this is pointless . 
  name a country with a spotless humanitarian record . 
  you 're arguing a false equivalence , which is exactly what i 'm taking issue with . 
  i used examples for both the usa and ussr from the 1950 and 60s ( hungary/czechoslovakia/france ) , and then again for the 1990s/2000s and 2010s ( eastern europe/crimea ) . 
  i 'm happy to talk about terrible things the us has done , but whataboutism is n't an argument , and comparing events outside of historical context does n't make an argument valid . 
  we invaded the country ? 
  til . 
  furthermore , it 's disingenuous to equivocate something the us did in the 1950s with something russia did less than three years ago . 
  when hungary and czechoslovakia stopped acting like complete puppets , you sent the tanks in to crush them . 
  when france decided to leave nato integrated command and kicked out nato personnel , we complied . 
  also consider that france was a far more important country than any in the eastern bloc . 
  i do n't recall american troops flooding into eastern europe in the 1990s , forcing them to join the eu and nato . 
  your country 's history of invading and occupying your neighbors has turned them against you . 
  i recall russian troops seizing another country 's territory not even three years ago . 
  the united states is far from perfect , but any attempt at a moral equivalence between our countries is intellectually dishonest , and you know it . 
  ukraine was torn between the eu 's sphere of influence and russia 's , not the us . 
  ukraine was a target of europeanization , a la an association agreement and eventual eu membership , just like the other former eastern bloc countries that are now eu members . 
  the extent to which ukraine was being pulled into the american sphere of influence was that the eu 's sphere of influence falls largely under the umbrella of the american sphere of influence , as well as musing by president george w. bush about potential nato membership . 
  the latter was eventually swept under the rug because it was too risky . 
  it was a memorandum , not a formal treaty , though it does n't justify russian aggression . 
  1 % is only a little more than 3 million people . 
  i have an extremely hard time believing that there are 317 million americans who could n't name le pen . 
  i 'm confident that more than 1 % could name le pen . 
  the dictionary definition ? 
  i 'd say he crossed that point when he publicly asked russia to find hillary 's deleted emails last summer . 
  the constitutional definition ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  if he 's directly implicated in collusion with russia , i think it 's more likely than not . 
  lobster and white people . 
   as part of intelligence operations being conducted against the united states for the last seven months , ** at least one western european ally ** intercepted a series of communications before the inauguration between advisers associated with president donald trump and russian government officials , according to people with direct knowledge of the situation . 
  ...  moreover , ** a baltic nation ** is gathering intelligence on officials in the trump white house and executives with the president 's company , the trump organization , out of concern that an american policy shift toward russia could endanger its sovereignty , according to a third person with direct ties to that nation 's government . 
  this is relevant news for this sub . 
  at least in the us , he would definitely be considered a millennial . 
  italy : least trustworthy - italy . 
  thanks for the laugh . 
  your english is pretty outdated too . 
  tpp 's raison d'\u00eatre was to create a regional trade system in asia that would both keep american influence in the region and prevent china from strong-arming the rest of asia as it creates a parallel international system . 
  you may have heard about the asian infrastructure investment bank , which many eu states opted to join despite protestations from the us and japan . 
  the entire point of the aiib is to duplicate the function of and erode the influence of the world bank and imf , which china perceives as tools of western dominance . 
  china deliberately avoids multilateral institutions and agreements when it can , because it likes to throw its weight around bilaterally ( because it 's so much more powerful than almost every other state on the planet ) . 
  with tpp dead , and the us unwilling to create a new multilateral economic system in asia , china has the opportunity to curry favor with the individual states of asia . 
  opposition to tpp , particularly on reddit , consisted of empty buzzwords and superficial understandings of international diplomacy , governance , and trade . 
  killing tpp was one of the stupidest geopolitical moves the us consciously made in recent memory . 
  bush tarnishes our global reputation . 
  obama restores it , for the most part . 
  trump comes in and ruins it in a matter of weeks . 
  i know a lot of americans do n't care about what the rest of the world thinks about us , but i do . 
  the republicans are an embarrassment . 
  you have to learn to walk before you can run . 
  i absolutely hate trump and pence , but goddamn that would be funny as shit . 
   its a shame to see how far you have fallen . 
  britain used to be the world 's most powerful country and created the largest empire in human history . 
  look at you now . 
  you have next to no influence in moscow , beijing , and washington .
