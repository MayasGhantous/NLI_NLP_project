  brexit and trump both won so now math is obsolete and experts are always wrong . 
  it 's a pr move . 
  she is making a play for the center .

  i 'm sorry that you ca n't recognize that authoritarianism , nationalism , militarism , xenophobia , scapegoating minorities , cronyism , anti-intellectualism , and corporatism are together the core tenets of fascism and are all present in parties like fn . 
  you could at least own up it and defend the merits of fascism instead of denying it outright . 
  if you support the tenets of fascism and still think you 're not a fascist , you 're also delusional . 
  if i call someone who supports fascist policies a fascist , it is n't an insult . 
  i 'm not interesting in softening the fascism 's image by refraining from using the word . 
  fascist is as much a slur as communist or liberal . 
  if you think fascism has an inherently negative connotation , perhaps you should ask yourself why that is instead of telling people to refrain from using it as a political descriptor . 
  we are n't going to re-brand fascism with a new term because it is associated with nazism . 
  in reality it does n't , but that 's par for the course for brexit . 
  it was a vote based on lies , half-truths , feels , and an appallingly poor understanding of the eu . 
  the most prominent aspect of the current right-wing populist craze is its hard stance on immigration and islamophobia . 
  brexit seemingly addresses those in the minds of its voters . 
  no dude , it 's 2017 . 
  you are n't allowed to call fascists fascists even if they claim to hate political correctness . 
  last year also taught me that you can perpetually move further to the right without ever becoming a fascist . 
  it 's the same in the us as well . 
  anti-immigration rhetoric plays well in rural red states that do n't have a lot of immigrants . 
  correct , the civil war was really the turning point . 
  let 's put it in language you can understand . 
  t_d posters get out reeeeeeeeee, 
  the pro-brexit arguments and pro-trump arguments are far more similar than i 'm sure you 'd like to admit . 
  i suspect trump 's overt stupidity is the real reason you do n't consider yourself a supporter . 
  filthy barbarian !, 
  the last panel was fun to draw . 
  i love that penelopegate is a word . 
  yea , i recall from lots of ir readings that japanese and west german foreign policy operated under similar constraints , where alignment with the us was generally the most important thing . 
  german reunification and greater european integration have pushed germany toward a new role in global affairs , unlike japan . 
  what the fuck would you have society do instead ? 
  ban all muslims from entering our countries ? 
  what about terrorist attacks committed by native-born muslims ? 
  what about terrorist attacks committed by native-born non-muslims ? 
  we have gun deaths every day in america , and the argument you 're making about drawing sad cartoons and changing your profile picture is the same shit that liberals attack conservatives for doing . 
  then conservatives come around and say that gun crime will never be eradicated and that the right to bear arms is more sacred . 
  you will never eradicate terrorism , no matter how hard you try . 
  what people such as yourself are essentially arguing for is an increasingly powerful police state to protect yourselves from a statistically insignificant threat blown out of proportion by bigotry and false senses of superiority . 
  at a certain point , the very society you create will become the kind of society you 're taking issue with in the first place . 
  if that really is what you want , there 's no shortage of countries like that to choose from . 
  spoiler warning : they 're all shitholes . 
  take your reactionary politics and shove it . 
  do n't fuck up . 
  this is exactly what a european leader trying to be anonymous on the internet would say . 
  wow , who knew ? 
  me too . 
  edit : thanks . 
   such as ? 
  i always see this thrown out but i never see anyone back it up with anything substantial . 
  * ** nationalism ** ( america first , american exceptionalism , maga , opposition to internationalism and its associated institutions like nato/eu/un ) * ** militarism ** ( `` we 're gon na bomb the shit out of isis , '' proposed $ 54b increase to the defense budget , saber-rattling with iran , north korea , and syria , using a moab and aircraft carrier movements as propaganda ) * ** anti-intellectualism ** ( denying evolution , antropogenic climate change , deriding academia for having a liberal bias , scoffing at experts - e.g. 
  `` why should we listen to pollsters if they got it wrong once ? '' ), 
  * ** cronyism ** ( betsy devos , ben carson , nikki haley , and rick perry , stephen miller , and steve bannon are not qualified to perform their current jobs . 
  there is no good reason for jared kushner and ivanka trump to be as influential as they are given their relatively limited professional experience and nonexistent history in governance . ), 
  * ** corporatism ** ( the very fact that trump is still intimately tied to his business and is fleecing taxpayers , proposals to cut the corporate tax rate , appointing businessmen to run the government e.g. 
  tillerson , mnuchin , ross , devos etc. 
  * ** scapegoating minorities ** ( dogwhistle racism , gerrymandering , blaming democrats - a political minority , muslims , mexicans , ( ( ( globalists ) ) ) etc. ), 
  * ** delegitimizing the media ** ( labeling everything that shows you in a bad light as fake news , `` the failing new york times , '' promoting conservative media outlets , reading breitbart and listening to infowars as news sources ) * ** authoritarianism ** ( tough on crime , warmongering , `` i alone can fix it . '', 
  - from trump 's rnc speech , expanding governmental surveillance powers ) all of these * together * ( key word here ) fits the textbook definition of fascism . 
  i 'm genuinely sorry that you do n't recognize it because that is the bigger problem . 
  you do n't need to get rid of elections to be a fascist . 
  i 'm not going to bother with the rest of your comment because it 's obvious you are n't interested in an honest conversation and are only here to push a specific narrative . 
  i do n't think he knows about second brexit , pip . 
   so stop calling us fascists . 
  only if you stop supporting fascist policies . 
   if you vote republicans out of powers we will actually step out of office . 
  am i mistaken , or is barack obama no longer the president ? 
   i also doubt you will see insane protests like you are from the left . 
  you 're right , protesting has always been something that is more common among the left . 
  it 's how you fight for progress and make your voice heard when your elected officials do n't represent your views . 
  when your political ideology represents maintaining the status quo , there is n't as much incentive to protest . 
  nevertheless , you 've seem to have forgotten the tea party protests from obama 's first term , as well as the completely different contexts in which both obama and trump were elected . 
  i 'm assuming you included the word insane to imply violence or intimidation and try to associate it with the left . 
  maybe that was n't your intent , but if it was , then you would be wrong . 
   if it happens and there are , feel free to tag me and tell me how wrong i am . 
  something tells me that your account will have been deleted by then . 
  except that i did n't argue that slavery is objectionable because the majority opposes it . 
  slavery is objectionable for a lot of reasons that i did n't list . 
  those arguments would still be valid regardless of their level of support . 
  abolitionist arguments have n't changed . 
  what has changed is their level of public support . 
  no , i 'm not advocating for violence in the name of social progress . 
  what i was suggesting is that if gay marriage became the law of the land in turkey despite majority popular opposition to it , they should have to get used to it . 
   it is socially conservative to be against mass immigration and islam . 
  i admit i do n't have a comprehensive solution to the problems posed by mass immigration , but at the same time i am not supportive of reactionary immigration policies . 
  opposing islam is not socially conservative . 
  some social conservatives oppose islam . 
  islam itself is a socially conservative ideology . 
  fundamentalist christians and muslims have more in common with each other 's political ideology than they 'd like to think . 
  many of the problems i have with islam 's political ideology exist in other religions like christianity . 
  opposing islam is a cover for religious and ethnic bigotry , because nearly all western muslims do n't go around beheading people , exactly like western christians . 
  i apologize for assuming you were a republican . 
  all i had to go off of was a comment that looked exactly as if it was written by one . 
  i 'm also not sure why you thought that comment was hateful . 
  i know , my first sentence literally acknowledges that morality is entirely subjective . 
  do n't act like republicans won a permanent grip on power . 
  they have lost before and they will lose again . 
  the us is a democracy , not a one party state . 
   if you decide to drag people against their will toward a society that you think is better , you will not win this is absolutely not true . 
  my country fought a civil war because half of it wanted to keep owning people as property .
