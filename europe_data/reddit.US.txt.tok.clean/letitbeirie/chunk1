norwegian . 
  interesting to read this since i literally five minutes ago learned in [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6oujtc/hello_askeurope_are_there_any_phrases_in_your/ ) that `` speaking norweigan '' is a finnish term for vomiting . 
  i do n't think anyone 's ever gotten poorer selling tongue-in-cheek shirts like [ this one ] ( https://www.fairfaxstatic.com.au/content/dam/images/1/1/g/e/e/8/image.related.articleleadnarrow.300x0.130j3b.png/1422465581329.jpg ) to american tourists . 
  nah , my living in the us . 
  since i started working for them i 've spent more time in the eu than america . 
  i 'm from the us . 
  my german employers seem to take issue with this , which explains why i 'm typing this from an ice somewhere just outside k\u00f6ln . 
  aw it wo n't be so bad , just give them an office and some fake job that will make them feel important . 
  c'mon it 'll be fun . 
  please ? 
  the [ orthographic depth ] ( http://www.danielwillingham.com/uploads/5/0/0/7/5007325/3963047_orig.jpg ) ( how well letters correspond with sounds ) can make it a very frustrating language to learn if you do n't start early . 
  / r/brutalism, 
  i 'm embarrassed because i got the balkans , the baltic states , and all of the microstates without issue , but i somehow managed to confuse austria for czechia * and * hungary for slovakia . 
  after 15 june it should work all over the eu . 
  i bought my card at an edeka but they 're available all over the place - grocery stores , train stations , airports probably . 
  before or after 15 june ? 
  if before , vodafone will let you use your allotments all over the eu but o2 ( de ) , for example , only works in germany . 
  i think they 're all supposed to allow you to use your plan roaming free after then though . 
  are you planning to use calling or mostly data ? 
  i mostly use the o2 data-only card which is like 5gb for 25 $ and is fast enough to stream music and make voip calls , but i also have a 10 $ vodafone card for travel which is much faster in the middle of cities and includes voice , but it 's only 1gb of data . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yaca_w_yvji/visw0vrc_ci/aaaaaaaacv8/ubxosuipgto/s1600/49.png ) to your first sentence . 
  nonsense . 
  all you need is an electoral college . 
  split is great , not sure if it qualifies as relatively unknown though . 
  i feel like you would n't have too much trouble traveling there as a german . 
  i 'd like to travel there too , but on a us passport i get fun extras like pre-travel visa and registration requirements , individual travel bans , and compulsory adherence to pre-approved travel itineraries so i 'll pass on that . 
  you have been made a moderator of / r/pyongyang, 
  than anywhere near the baltic ? 
  probably true . 
  you usually only see saunas at fancy hotels and upper tier gyms , it 's almost unheard of to have one in your house . 
  to further bewilder english speaking children who are only just getting over the fact that die deutschen who live in deutschland are not , in fact , the dutch . 
  even if you 're just there for a short time , being able to at least adequately open the conversation in the local language completely changes the rest of the interaction for the better . 
  it can also reveal the language learner as a foreigner and allow the native speaker to mentally prepare for the inevitable switch to english , so double bonus ? 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ebs7scozo ), 
  duisburg hbf is where i have to connect to get to the netherlands unless i want to take slow trains and connect in rheine , m\u00fcnster , and hamm . 
  it 's an interesting place , but at least it has that one good d\u00f6ner shop . 
  every morning . 
  as if everyone was meeting for the first time . 
  and it 's not some little shop where it 's a small tradition , it 's one of the biggest companies in germany . 
  everyone does this at my office ( in nrw , disregard flair ) after presentations . 
  is it done mostly in formal settings ? 
  everyone at my office shakes hands each morning too . 
  in the us , fries are almost always eaten by hand , even when covered in something messy like green chili . 
  here in germany they 're eaten with a fork ( and knife , if available ) and even street vendors give you a tiny plastic fork to use . 
  i 'm originally from denver but i 've lived in a small town just outside das ruhrgebiet ( nw germany ) for a few months now . 
  how well do i fit in ? 
  not well , but improving . 
  in addition to my german language skills being very weak , there are many small cultural differences that have gotten me some judgmental looks but are n't major enough for me to be called out on them - eating french fries by hand vs. with a fork is one that immediately comes to mind . 
  with that said , i 've been trying to observe how my colleagues at work act and follow suit and i 've been working on improving my german as well , so i feel like i 'm looking more like an expat and less like a tourist at least . 
  will i make a life for myself here ? 
  i 'm over here for work so i 'll probably be moving back to colorado before the end of the year , but it 's not uncommon for people in my company to move to a different country for a project and stay there forever . 
  it 's hard to say if i 'll make a life for myself here or not yet - though i really like living in germany and i certainly would n't mind living here for a while longer . 
  there 's not much to do in my little town , but living here is really easy , everyone 's nice , things are pretty cheap for the most part , and if i get bored , db is always there to take me to somewhere less boring . 
  what do i think of the local politics ? 
  i 'm somewhat surprised the cdu won my state instead of the spd , but it 's not like the afd had a huge win even though they managed to pick up enough votes to get into the state parliament . 
  i 'm new here so i do n't know the specific issues and characters well enough to comment , but just watching the process makes me extremely jealous - i moved here just after trump 's inauguration and every political disaster i read about from back home makes it that much less appealing to move back . 
  not sure if it has anything to do with it but the accent in the mid-atlantic region ( philadelphia especially ) drops the h sound on almost every word with it . 
  human = you-man house = owse with = eid etc. 
  yeah i did n't mean that as a slight at all - i know exactly what you mean with the difference between being literate in a language and being a fluent speaker . 
  i can read formally written spanish ( i.e. 
  without much slang ) pretty easily but having a conversation with a native spanish speaker that does n't result in the spanish speaker switching to english is a little victory for me . 
  completely different issues for sure , i was just pointing out that there 's no shortage of people who think nothing of mocking the sins of other people 's ancestors while at the same time trying to distance themselves from the actions of their own . 
  and many of them are probably the same people who think black americans should just `` get over '' the whole slavery thing because it was so long ago . 
  not that it 's fair exactly , but a lot of those stereotypes ( in the us at least ) like the berets and the smoking were probably brought back by infantrymen who fought in france back in the 40s and then perpetuated through several generations of americans who 've never been to france . 
  the one on your list i have experienced is trouble finding english-speaking staff at my hotel while visiting paris a while back but i ca n't bitch too much because i 'm sure it was easier than finding french-speaking staff at a comparable hotel in new york ... 
  you hit on one of our false stereotypes that 's fairly common - that the us has great weather . 
  it 's easy to see how it perpetuates , the best weather in the country is in la , and so is hollywood . 
  the midwest , as you mentioned , has some of the worst weather on the planet . 
  it 's miserably cold ( -25 \u00ba ) , snowy , and cloudy all winter , and it 's miserably hot ( +40 \u00ba ) and humid in the summer with tornadoes and dust storms . 
  sort of on the same note , there 's a stereotype ( in the us at least ) that german trains are all 100 % to-the-minute punctual . 
  my +33 train from bielefeld to hannover on saturday would beg to differ ... 
  ironically enough , the origin of the joke was actually parodying a stereotype of the scots : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzukevu-twm, 
  no other nation i 'm aware of has as many people who speak in as clear of an american accent as the dutch all seem to . 
  it 's easier to point out canadians than dutch speakers by the accent sometimes . 
  netherlands : not legal , but if police see you using in public , they do nothing . 
  colorado : legal , but if police see you using in public , they write you a ticket . 
  \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af indeed . 
  so is drinking a beer in public looked down upon in france even though it 's legal ? 
  in my state in the us many people drink in parks etc. 
  but they usually pour their drinks into solo cups to be discreet and avoid getting a ticket . 
  we ca n't drink a beer in public , but we can buy cannabis from a store . 
  america 's a weird place sometimes ... 
  seriously ? 
  sorry you had to endure that , i thought we were past that . 
  it 's not like we do n't have our [ own ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_the_united_states ) [ skeletons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_removal_act ) [ in ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/my_lai_massacre ) [ the ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eugenics_in_the_united_states ) [ closet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_trump ) or anything ... 
  i was once told by a woman fluent in english , german , french , and dutch that you can consider yourself mostly fluent in a language when you can have an argument in it . 
  the sad thing is the us media is probably quick to cry `` russia '' because some of their viewers might be crazy right-wingers and they would n't want to lose market share . 
  also , a lot of them are still mortified from getting played in our election so they 're a little sensitive about election-related hacks at the moment . 
  if it makes you feel any better , at least you got rid of her after 6 months . 
  we 're stuck with her forever . 
  kind of - i think ( hope ? ), 
  nearly all americans who 've completed their secondary education know enough recent history to realize that europe is n't one big happy family , but the mere existence of the eu makes it very easy for our media to generalize that way and they tend to treat anything the eu does as if they 're speaking for all of europe . 
  on top of that , between brexit and our glorious new president ( / s ) , our media have largely had their hands full so most big country-specific issues in europe have n't gotten any press at all . 
  i know the dutch election did n't get any coverage , it does n't look like the turkish debacle or the upcoming french election are getting much either , even though they really should . 
  it 's a valid point , but the truth is i was rocking the liberian flair because i could n't tell the difference on my small phone screen . 
  think i got it this time - hopefully i did n't pick malaysia ... 
  shit . 
  well that 's what i get for messing with my flair on an iphone 5 screen ... 
  i 've subscribed to this sub for a while now because i think reading about different european perspectives is interesting . 
  it 's especially interesting to me now since i 've been relocated by my company to germany for the time being .
