because that 's what he 's doing , sucking up . 
  like how blair was sucking up to bush , and did n't really believe in [ liberal imperialism ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/07/1 ) as his foreign policy chief said . 
  johnson would be saying this regardless of who the president was , because he 's boris johnson and a longtime believer in anglosphere cooperation . 
  most of the migrants you 're talking about are from africa and have nothing to do with us . 
  as for iraqis , the us has accepted as many as the uk , and at least when it invaded iraq , the us sent its own kids and kept them deployed there for eight years until the place was ( thought to be ) stable . 
  france , britain and italy bombed the shit out of libya and did nothing whatsoever to build stability . 
  and france did nothing to help in iraq or syria either , for 10 years , despite having spent the previous 10 years crushing iraq with sanctions and supporting saddam before that , and playing games with fran\u00e7afrique , and aiding the arab spring . 
  and british people were in favor of the iraq war , and blair had his `` new colonialism '' agenda . 
  do n't go scapegoating us for all your problems . 
  i sometimes feel that it might have been better if we had never brought * democracy ^ tm * to your country either . 
  you are the gullible one here . 
  adhering to the common leftist opinions where you 're from is n't skepticism . 
  germany is the most anti-american country in europe and that 's why you believe this , not because you 've given it serious critical thought . 
  these were the opinions putin used to get you to side with him over iraq , and to get you to [ block georgia and ukraine from membership in nato ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html ) because it would be ( in your government 's words ) `` an unnecessary offense to russia . '', 
  your unrelenting hatred of america is a tool of russian foreign policy and has been used to undermine the west again and again . 
   the sole fact that he is president now abundantly makes clear that you guys are very bad at detecting bullshit , so it should n't be a big surprise , it is sad nontheless . 
  clinton won the popular vote . 
  but yes , we 've begun listening to this bullshit as well . 
  we 're all slaves to putin now . 
   well i can assure you , that the us of a never gave a single shit about how a country was governed when they went to war against it . 
  except for our entire history of course . 
  the us is the main reason iraq is a democracy today , and afghanistan . 
  and japan , korea , taiwan , the philippines , germany , eastern europe , etc. 
  the globe is scattered with the history of our democratizing efforts , all of which will be totally unappreciated by you and other german leftists . 
   first , if you know how it works explain why russia needs the support of france to veto your bullshit . 
  because chirac and schr\u00f6der 's support allowed him to pretend it was motivated by something other than russian imperialism . 
   second , why should we pick up the pieces of your idiot war that we strongly opposed in the first place ? 
  because it affects you . 
  but even knowing that , you refused to help . 
  and germany did n't only side with putin over iraq . 
  you also sided with him in [ blocking georgia and ukraine from being admitted to nato . 
  ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html ) putin has been manipulating your country for 16 years with the help of your persistent anti-americanism . 
  someone who does nothing to help for 10 years can hardly complain . 
  and yes , i know how it works . 
  you said it two comments above mine . 
  sometimes i think the trump types have a point . 
  in 2003 , it was putin and chirac who used their security council veto to block un authorization for the liberation of iraq . 
  germany did n't have a veto , but schr\u00f6der strongly supported putin and is credited with moving chirac into that camp . 
   some people also forget that saddam 's army came from us military aid provided to fight against iran . 
  is this satire ? 
  saddam 's military was entirely soviet-equipped and soviet-trained , except for his air force , [ which was french and soviet . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran%e2%80%93iraq_war#attacks_on_shipping ) and [ germany supplied most of his chemical weapons . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_chemical_weapons_program#the_1980s_program ) why do you think it came from us ? 
  / u/pillepallepulle :  and do you actually think your government cared the least little bit about democracy in iraq ? 
  it quite obviously did . 
  that 's not our cover . 
  it 's the actual reason we exist , to thomas jefferson at least . 
  and top us officials today certainly agree with him . 
  you can only believe it 's cover if you deny that geopolitics has anything to do with ideology , and in that case , you should read up on something called the cold war . 
  the modern `` great game '' is about ideas , not nations . 
  today 's empires are of the mind . 
  dugin certainly knows that . 
  we only undermine our own ideology by pretending that 's not the case . 
  [ not just iraq . 
  ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html ) but yes , they also helped putin block the un from authorizing iraq . 
  and yeah , you win , it 's a stupid idea to sacrifice our lives for democracy on other continents . 
  and we agree with you now . 
  so goodbye nato . 
  it was fun . 
  well , on one hand there is the [ conceptual framework ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empire_of_liberty ) of american foreign policy to which both clintons , both bushes , both roosevelts , reagan , kennedy , lincoln , monroe , jefferson and most other presidents have subscribed , but on the other hand , there 's you . 
  please , tell me how the world really works . 
  yes , exactly . 
  ah , were you thinking i was a trump voter ? 
  no , his voters agree with you . 
  clinton was the warmonger . 
  the blunder was obviously retreating . 
  and why did n't we let them kill each other ? 
  why indeed ? 
  maybe some of us cared about democracy ? 
  or the 30 years of promises we 'd made to the kurds ? 
  why indeed did we do operation provide comfort , operation northern watch , etc. ? 
  why did we intervene in kosovo ? 
  why have we had 30,000 troops defending south korea for the past 65 years ? 
  you 're asking why we do n't let the world kill itself , and i 'm an idiot ? 
  do n't be a typical american who calls names and does n't try to understand . 
  the nightmare you 're describing is that after years of hearing this , we americans finally agree with you : it was none of our business . 
  and you 're none of our business . 
  freedom on other continents is none of our business anymore . 
  from now on , we 're only concerned with ourselves . 
  that should make you happy , right ? 
  there were massive protests all over europe about removing a genocidal dictator and restoring freedom to iraqis and kurds . 
  yes , i remember . 
  and i remember all the media being flooded with bullshit about how bush was the next hitler and was trying to colonize iraq and steal its oil , instead of returning its sovereignty as he did , and the nauseating racist claims that arabs ca n't govern themselves , and absolutely no skepticism about putin 's motives in interfering . 
  and putin and dugin applaud you for saying so . 
  iran and syria , both with russian support , spent years trying to destabilize iraq , but as the book says , `` the main scapegoat must be the u.s. '', 
   we 're the ones getting the millions of migrants coming from isil , we have tens of millions of illegal immigrants in our country - not even legal migrants , but illegal immigrants . 
  and we 've also had 13 years of solid anti-americanism from our own left and from you , leading to our own disillusionment and current situation . 
   we 're the ones getting the millions of migrants coming from isil , after it grew in the anarchy of the iraq occupation . 
  in what world do you think you anything was solved ? 
  it actually grew out of obama 's withdrawal in 2011 , which was a result of that same pressure . 
  iraq was n't occupied . 
  it was and is a sovereign , democratic nation . 
  bush was not the new calligula , nor was he an imperialist . 
  and if iraq 's democracy had been restored under un auspices , as bush wanted , it obviously would have turned out better than it did . 
  and france and germany did n't just side with putin on iraq . 
  they also sided with him against georgia 's admission to nato , and on other issues . 
  sure , and he used his veto to block un authorization because he 's a peaceful non-interventionist , not because he saw an opportunity to use your left to divide nato and pave the way for his own expansionism . 
  the fact that you still think it was a bad idea does n't bode well for the future . 
  no need to stop there . 
  the book also mentions the necessity of turning france and germany against the united states , and it 's interesting to remember who ended up siding with putin against us from 2003 to 2009 .
