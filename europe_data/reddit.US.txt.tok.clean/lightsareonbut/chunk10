  denying that the influence of american culture in korea and japan ( our allies for generations ) is greater than in china ? 
  denying the existence of common chinese attitudes about democracy , accusing me of making them up ? 
  this is like arguing with a trump voter . 
  it 's impossible for it to go anywhere if you 're going to fight to the death against any factual statement . 
    japan and korea have both adopted western culture to a large extent . 
   no more so than china . 
  how can you say that ? 
  korea is almost america 2 . 
  and the japanese national sport is baseball , for goodness ' sake . 
   which they do n't . 
  could you even explain what these ` experiences ' are and how they back anything up ? 
  doubtful . 
  i. . . are you joking ? 
  and ... 
  i was trying not to be confrontational , but :   it 's actually your problem if you 're trying to convince someone of something . 
   not really . 
  it 's the person who refuses to accept the truth because it comes covered in words they do n't like who ` se missing out . 
  this is exactly what i meant . 
  you have * the truth , * and other cultures just need to * accept * it . 
  this is the definition of white man 's burden . 
  your role is to teach a world of cultural inferiors how to be civilized . 
  and not by persuading , but simply by * informing * them how a civilized person acts . 
  if you do n't think that 's what it is , then just tell me , can you honestly say that you do n't perceive europe as the center of civilization , and europeans as the most enlightened and civilized people ? 
  why ca n't the eu , with 500 million people , absorb 1 million muslims ? 
  maybe think less about possible negative consequences and more about the definite reality of what life is like for refugees . 
  people , including children , are already drowning while trying to cross the mediterranean . 
  the largest refugee groups are syrian , afghan and iraqi . 
  your government is partly responsible for what these people are going through . 
    / u/bravebalkanhamster was right to call this condescending . 
   the truth is the truth ; whether someone considers it to be condescending is their problem . 
  it 's actually your problem if you 're trying to convince someone of something . 
   the fact that you 're going there says more about you than it does me , since at no point have i equated developed with western . 
  i 'm pretty sure white people are a minority in japan or south korea . 
  japan and korea have both adopted western culture to a large extent . 
  and , sorry , but you 've missed the point a few times . 
  i think this could be useful : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principle_of_charity 1 . 
  i did n't say the chinese are right about democracy . 
  i said they have different opinions , and their own experiences back up their opinions . 
  there are those who argue that democracy does n't actually work as well as autocracy for raising the standard of living in ` developing ' countries , because democratic governments are incapable of taking the actions necessary to achieve needed results . 
  i do n't believe that , but many chinese do . 
  no , we do n't have an economic advantage over china anymore . 
  we 're at least as dependent on them as they are on us . 
  treaties aside , the point is that what you consider universal human rights are n't what the average chinese considers universal human rights . 
  there is no such thing as a universal definition of human rights , and the un saying it does n't make it so . 
  ugh , that 's ridiculous . 
  i 'm sorry , but he even threatened to veto congress 's attempt to arm ukraine , until they overrode him by voting 98 % in favor . 
  he 's not even close to being a neocon . 
  he hates the very idea of conflict . 
  that 's why he 's relied so much on drone operations and airstrikes in the first place . 
  he refuses to send us troops anywhere he does n't absolutely have to . 
  his opposition to the iraq war , war in general , was a central issue in his campaign . 
  clinton is severely underrated . 
  people hate her ; she 's ruthless , militaristic , has an acerbic personality that rubs people the wrong way ; [ but it 's clear from her private arguments with obama that she has a much better grasp of statecraft and geostrategy than him . 
  ] ( http://freebeacon.com/national-security/obama-furious-clinton-criticizing-foreign-policy/ ) it was obama who refused to commit us forces to syria , despite her urging ; who refused to commit fully to libya ; who vetoed congress 's attempt to arm ukraine ; who withdrew us forces from iraq , and who originated the hopelessly naive ` reset ' with russia . 
  on all of those issues , she was right and he was wrong . 
  the really sad part is that we all knew obama would be an anti-war president ; he campaigned on that . 
  but now we learn for the umpteenth time that pacifism does n't actually work on this planet . 
  actually , obama is the opposite of a warmonger ; he 's refused to commit us to either syria , libya or ukraine . 
  [ and it 's too bad , because it really made a mess of the situation  ( http://freebeacon.com/national-security/obama-furious-clinton-criticizing-foreign-policy/ )  prime minister of france manuel valls told goldberg that `` by not intervening early , we have created a monster . 
  we were absolutely certain that the u.s. administration would say yes . 
  working with the americans , we had already seen the targets . 
  it was a great surprise . 
  if we had bombed as was planned , i think things would be different today . '', 
  we 're not the superpower the world needs . 
  we 're the superpower it deserves . 
  it was more the way you said it : * `` in developed countries , people have the opinion that __________________ . 
  '' * / u/bravebalkanhamster was right to call this condescending . 
  i know it 's an offensive thing to say , but this is the remnant of the ` white man 's burden ' attitude , in which ` developed ' means ` western . ', 
  we all do it , but we should probably stop , because it 's 2016 and other countries do n't have to let us define civilized behavior . 
  we 're having this problem in a big way with asia and the middle east . 
  we keep thinking we 're china 's guides on the path to democracy , but they do n't actually want democracy ; their history tells them that democracy is n't the best way to govern , and the different experiences of china and india over the past 50 years back them up . 
  when we criticize their ` human rights violations , ' we just sound like arrogant barbarians , and now that we no longer have an economic advantage over them , they do n't need to listen . 
  same problem with turkey , russia , etc. 
  if we want other people to accept our ideas , we need to stop acting like our ideas are the universal standard of civilized behavior . 
  the thing is , they disapprove of our social policies as well , and despite that , they 've been reliable allies . 
  and they have to work within the bounds of their own culture . 
  for example , prince saud had to publicly call the iraq war a colonial misadventure , even while secretly collaborating with it . 
  thank you as well . 
  by ` when the sunni regime collapsed , ' i mean saddam 's , yes . 
  after he died , a bloody civil war would probably have ended with iran taking over . 
  it had been harboring/training iraqi dissidents for that purpose - including the current pm of iraq , iirc . 
  the us tried to prevent this , but it looks like we blew it . 
  re : daesh , it was n't inevitable . 
  when the us withdrew in 2010 , the country was fairly stable . 
  obama wanted to leave an american force in the country , but he and al-maliki could n't agree on the details , so we left . 
  it was a mistake . 
  libya is a baffling situation . 
  from what i read , it was clinton , as sec state , who persuaded obama to intervene . 
  but then obama would n't commit american troops to the situation . 
  so it ended up being a disappointing half-measure - kind of a theme of his presidency . 
  i think the basic reason we 've failed in both cases has been a lack of commitment , and dishonest leadership . 
  i was just ranting about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4yie7f/do_you_know_that_sweden_has_the_highest_rape_rate/d6odbe8, 
  [ oh well , it was a nice idea . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empire_of_liberty ) you 're probably right that admitting the reason for vietnam was what changed things . 
  but it would n't have , if we 'd won . 
  vietnam really fucked up our shit . 
  thanks for the discussion . 
   telling the people that their sons are going to be shot , blown up and beheaded as pawns in some great geopolitical game is n't going to swell the ranks of your volunteer army a geopolitical game is what the average voter already believes it is . 
  the reality is that it 's not a game : it 's the future of this planet . 
  there could n't be anything more serious .
