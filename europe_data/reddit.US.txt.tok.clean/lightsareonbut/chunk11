  and with china surpassing us industrially and soon militarily , our window of opportunity to deal with remaining threats to the world order is closing . 
  of course leaders ca n't be that frank about it , but like you said , it 's not a secret . 
  and if the average voter does n't understand it , we 're in trouble . 
   the inevitable question is asked ; `` why are american soldiers dying in x country so far from home ? '', 
  the answer is almost never palatable . 
  because , again , the true answers are never given . 
  it 's always some feeble lie . 
  american presidents , beginning with washington and jefferson and continuing through teddy roosevelt , used to actually talk about our empire , with a capital e , but for the past 50 years the subject has been unmentionable . 
  they 're afraid to even mention the word , much less explain the point of it . 
  our national seal is a floating eye of destiny above an unfinished pyramid and the words * new world order . 
  * ( * new order of the ages * if you 're being pedantic ) . 
  our national interest has never changed ; it 's just never admitted . 
  how can we believe in a project our leaders wo n't even admit to exist ? 
  we have no stomach for it because our leaders lie to us , * badly , * and discredit themselves and feed their critics , and leave us disgusted and with no reason to fight . 
  we can endure losses . 
  we just need a legitimate reason . 
  btw , this is why i 'm actually excited to be voting for clinton . 
  she will use our power . 
  she 'll drag democrats back into syria and i think she may even get them to understand what militarism is all about . 
  i do n't know how you can actually feel insulted that they did n't join our war over fictional wmds . 
  even americans wanted out within a few years of getting in . 
  bush 's lies so thoroughly discredited traditional american militarism that we do n't even want back in now , to help the iraqis and kurds win an actual war of good versus evil against an army of animals who burn humans alive in cages . 
  if the neocons had just been honest about why we were there , that we were expanding the 'em pire of liberty ' as jefferson intended , making good on 30 years of promises made to the kurds , preventing iran from exporting its theocracy , changing the future of islam , etc. 
  etc. , novus ordo seclorum , we would have stayed committed . 
  but they had to make up some bullshit story about terrorism and wmds , and now we 're all fucked . 
  iraq is fucked , the middle east , islam , our empire , the 21st century , everything , fucked . 
  and you 're mad at the french ? 
  we ca n't blame them - our casus belli was a lie . 
  our alliance does n't exist to allow us to drag them into our wars of choice . 
  it would have been better for iraq , and for europe , if they had helped , but the fact that they did n't was our fault at least as much as theirs . 
   childish remark as `` revenge '' [ `` this action today is a small but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure many on capitol hill have with our so-called ally , france . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_fries ), 
   let 's leave aside the fact that what you and your countrymen might consider harassing women , and what * women * would actually consider to be harassing might very well be two very different things while that 's true , what you consider harassing women , and what women actually consider harassing , are probably also different things . 
  women from different cultures have different beliefs , just like men . 
  there 's not a universal ` developed ' set of beliefs that nation * x * defines and nation * j * fails to adopt . 
   and later that night he sent a simple tweet . 
  `` may allah grant success to the caliph . '', 
  [ allah does n't side with barbarians , anjem . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37093856 ), 
  that was treason , and reagan would have gone to prison for it if his subordinate had n't taken the bullet . 
  compared to other nations , we were n't actually providing much to either side . 
  and nothing to iran . 
  all their american stuff was from before the islamic revolution in 1979 . 
  the iran-iraq war started one year later , in 1980 , when saddam decided to take advantage of their chaotic situation . 
  and actually , at that time , the soviets were planning a coup d'etat in iraq , just as they had supported the revolution in iran . 
  and just as russia is now supporting iran , while also arming their enemies in the ksa , which is involved in an ideological war with iran . 
  there are lots of agendas here , not just ours . 
  specifically , it 's because the un security council passed a unanimous resolution in 2011 extending the icc 's jurisdiction over libya , even though it never agreed to the treaty . 
  and that is why we 're not so enthusiastic about this ` international government ' thing . 
  sense of humor has suffered a critical error and must shut down . 
  wat iraq fought the iran-iraq war with dassault super \u00c9tendards , mirage f1s and mig-23s ... ironically , the iranians were using american tomcats . 
  and had an excellent kill ratio . 
  [ wars of aggression were n't illegal under the icc until 2010 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_of_aggression ) there were reasons . 
  removing a genocidal dictator , supporting the kurds we 'd been making promises to for 30 years , exporting democracy , turning iraq into a strategic ally and keeping it from becoming a vassal of our devoted enemies , iran , when the sunni regime collapsed . 
  but those are n't the kinds of reasons you can present to the un . 
  and really , destroying the nation - the un 's peaceful sanctions did most of that for us , over the previous decade . 
  i 'm afraid i have to agree that bush 's pessimism is at least somewhat warranted . 
  the icc 's judges are elected by 124 countries . 
  i 'm not sure how many people would expect a fair trial if alleged us war criminals were being judged by a panel of chile , honduras and congo . 
  actually , russia is doing that , selling arms to both ksa and iran , funding both sides . 
  iran is no friend of ours . 
  we went into iraq in the first place partly to keep it from iran . 
  and then they spent years sabotaging its democracy and destabilizing it with shiite ` militia , ' and corrupting it into their sphere of influence . 
  iran 's presence in iraq is a clear defeat for the united states . 
  i was n't actually being serious in referring to the netherlands as ` evil . ', 
  :p 2002 was the year the icc treaty went into effect . 
  bush 's justification for not ratifying it was that he believed americans would n't be treated fairly by the icc , and honestly , he was probably right , judging from the upvotes on your comment about americans being tried en masse . 
  even clinton did n't recommend ratifying it , and i do n't think clinton ii will either . 
  it will probably be a long before we 'll consent to something like that . 
  not above the law . 
  the us never signed the icc treaty , so in that scenario , you would actually be the criminals . 
  the act authorizes the president to use ` all means necessary ' to rescue us from your evil clutches . 
  in reality , i think a phone call would be sufficient . 
  what 's funny is that they think we 're joking . 
  note : we are joking . 
  the us never ratified the icc treaty , so the hague has no legal authority to detain or prosecute us anyway .

  they 're more likely to have iranian than american connections . 
  iraq is majority shi'a and so is its current government . 
    i 'm sorry for being small and economically fucked by communism who was imposed by out side force ...  why is that the united states ' problem ? 
  the most consistent tradition in american foreign policy for 240 years has been the identification of its national interest with the spread of democracy worldwide . 
  in wwi it was ` making the world safe for democracy , ' in wwii it was ` arsenal of democracy , ' and ever since then it 's been ` exporting democracy ' and expanding the ` free world . ', 
  [ your national seal is an unfinished pyramid with the inscription * new world order . 
  * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/national_seal.jpg/1167px-national_seal.jpg ) that belief in global ideological war has been part of the united states for as long as it 's existed .

  eh ... our leftists ( i say this as a leftist ) are constantly looking to sweden as an example to emulate . 
  not really . 
  whether they ` want ' to fight or not , nato 's interest is n't served by any erosion of european democracy . 
   actual republican voters have been angry about nafta and the wto for , what , 20 years ? 
  they have n't , though . 
  congress voted 98 % in favor of arming ukraine . 
  republicans complain about burden-sharing , but they would never support withdrawing from nato , or worse yet , refusing to honor our treaty obligations . 
  same with the wto . 
  in fact , the american enterprise institute , which has backed every republican candidate for 50 years , came straight out and said about trump 's wto idea , [ `` this is the ranting of an ignorant fool . '' ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/republicans-keep-distance-from-trump-attack-on-wto-226166 )  us parties are not like parties in canada or much of europe where the leadership can ban potential candidates or expel members they do n't like . 
  they stand for what their voters decide they stand for . 
  in a sense , yes , but their voters are also manipulated and misinformed into the positions they have , to the benefit of the republican party . 
  the southern strategy is a tactic used by republicans to get southern white votes , by appealing to their racism . 
  the party came first , making the decision to appeal to racism as a way of getting votes .
