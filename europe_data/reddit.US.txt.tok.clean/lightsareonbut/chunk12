  trump 's nomination is the dog finally slipping its leash .

   one thing that i think most people outside the us ( and many inside ) do n't understand is how little substantive difference there is between a `` normal '' republican nominee and trump . 
  [ ... ] he says loudly what they normally say quietly and deniably . 
  no , he does n't . 
  congressional republicans would never abandon nato . 
  they would never be against nafta or the wto . 
  they 've already denounced him on these and other issues . 
  trump is basically republican voters ' rejection of their own party . 
  it 's not so surprising when you consider that it 's a two-party system and that only slightly more than half our electorate even votes . 
  the polls you see are of ` likely voters . ', 
  overall , no more than 25 % of the electorate would ever vote for trump . 
  and that same percent of americans say on surveys that the sun orbits the earth . 
  and clinton 's not so bad . 
  as corrupt as she is , i believe she 's basically a patriot , and she does know what she 's doing . 
  what are you reading ? 
  the uk has more objections to ttip than the rest of the eu , and we 're not on friendly terms with eastern europe ? 
  what ? 
  the nhs/pharmaceutical issue was basically the uk 's only issue with ttip . 
  aside from that , the us and uk have been negotiating as a bloc . 
  there 's no question about whether we 'll want free trade with the uk . 
  we want free trade with pretty much everyone , and especially the uk . 
  our spy services are integrated in the most thorough intelligence alliance in history , we have visa-free travel , we 're the largest foreign investor in their economy and vice-versa , but we do n't want free trade ? 
  it just needs a little exorcism . 
  [ our national seal gets like that sometimes .

  that was 55 years ago and the situation today is totally different : russian missile submarines are now just as close and can easily obliterate the united states , just as ours can obliterate russia . 
  ` red lines ' like that do n't exist any more . 
  i did n't realize there 'd been such a boom either .

  it probably does include first and second-generation immigrants . 
  but a majority of americans are first - , second - or third-generation immigrants . 
  i guess it 's comparing apples to oranges , in some ways . 
   yet the average nordic american is hilariously far behind the asians , the indians and the muslims ? 
  that 's not so surprising . 
  indian and muslim americans are among the best-educated of our ethnic groups . 
  [ 70 % of indian american adults have college degrees , ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/30/5-facts-about-indian-americans/ ) and 40 % have advanced degrees . 
  it 's a stereotype in the us that all indians are either doctors or tech geniuses . 
  muslim americans also tend to be well-educated and well-paid . 
  as for comparing nordic americans to nordic nordics , i do n't know as much about that ... but [ student loan debt is a recent problem , ] ( http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/crazy%20student%20loans%202011-q2.png ) not one that 's been around for a long time .

  `` after 20 years and at a cost of $ 100,000,000,000 , we 've developed a nuclear bomber that , when thrown into the air , will return to its owner . '', 
  no i did n't . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  where did i say indian removal was a ` good thing ? ', 
  no , i do n't . 
  read the comment again . 
  use wikipedia to look up unfamiliar references . 
  no , it 's not saying that . 
  actually , our most successful demographic , by wealth/education , are asian americans , and especially indian americans . 
  muslim americans also tend to be wealthier and better educated . 
  considering the historic supermajority he inherited , he has n't done a lot . 
  remember when congressional democrats , led by pelosi , said they 'd never sign a healthcare bill that lacked a public option ? 
  he reached out to republicans instead , letting them make hundreds of changes to the affordable care act . 
  and in the end , they all voted against it anyway . 
  it 's been the same with foreign leaders . 
  that ` reset ' thing with russia was obama 's idea , and it 's been reported that clinton , despite being secretary of state , never actually believed it would go anywhere . 
  because she knows better . 
  but obama believed , and putin used his desire to compromise against him . 
  and please stop downvoting everything you disagree with . 
  s/he 's totally right . 
  obama is a community organizer . 
  his desire is for everyone to agree . 
  he wanted to end our partisan deadlock , but his mistake was thinking he could do that in a community organizing way , by finding some kind of compromise that would ` heal our divisions . ', 
  he does n't realize two things : 1 . 
  our divisions are mechanical consequences of our entrenched two-party system , caused by gerrymandering , first-past-the-post voting , etc. 
  no amount of talk is going to change them . 
  compromise is what kills us . 
  all our proudest moments have been when the good among us have refused to compromise : the abolition of slavery , the civil rights act , the defense of korea , the rebuilding of japan , etc. 
  * compromising * has lead to the opposite : the 3/5 compromise , the missouri compromise , indian removal , japanese internment , and obamacare . 
  compromise has always held us back from achieving our potential . 
  there 's no point in continuing if you 're just going to assume that you understand our issues better than us and accuse us of making up excuses when we try to explain them . 
   just making up excuses and that 's literally what my original comment predicted you 'd say , before i edited it because i did n't want to seem confrontational . 
  because , of course , you would understand this better , even though it 's a situation outside your experience . 
  it 's a combination of them . 
  i think the example of the party coordinator was a pretty good one . 
  continuing from your argument above :  but that 's not a problem since the us has 56 times nore people who can coordinate we do n't , actually . 
  we still only have only one president/pm , exactly the same number as denmark . 
  one of each cabinet minister/secretary , exactly the same . 
  at a certain point , a democracy starts running into problems . 
  it 's kind of amazing that india 's doing as well as it is . 
  you do n't find that any very large nations have these programs in place . 
  we = americans . 
  it would be theoretically easier if we had a more centralized structure . 
  but if that were the case , we would also have fallen apart long ago . 
  a highly decentralized federation is probably the only way a continent can exist as a single democracy . 
  even then , the union broke apart once already and was only brought back together by military force . 
  when that question is asked of anyone , the answer is usually , ` experience . ', 
   you realize denmark has a population of 5.6 million people , right ? 
  i can already predict how this conversation will go . 
  no , they do n't know what that implies and you 'll probably end up on shitamericanssay for trying to explain it . 
  the default assumption is that everything just ` scales up ' at a 1:1 ratio .
