  clinton 's position is that we need to be doing a lot more . 
  [ but crimeans do n't actually disapprove of their situation . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/ ) are we trying to save them from democracy ? 
  [ our own polling shows that crimeans actually approve of annexation . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/ ) that 's not going to change . 
  arm ukraine . 
  strengthen europe . 
  that 's clinton 's position anyway . 
  i actually want a better relationship with russia , which is one reason i 'll be happy to vote for her . 
  ironically , being a corrupt military hardliner makes her a much better diplomat in this situation than obama ever could be . 
   you are still in free fall and you know it . 
  it does n't even matter if they are . 
  they 're never giving crimea back . 
  crimea would n't even vote to go back . 
  * which means sooner or later , we 'll have to give in , which makes all of this economic warfare pointless . 
   russians will always choose this , while west will always choose the opposite . 
  this is what makes us so different . 
  ahem . 
  frontier spirit , and all that . 
  we 're not that different . 
  economic sanctions are a morally shitty and self-defeating strategy of diplomacy anyway . 
  obama 's reliance on them is just another example of his general ineptitude in dealing with adversarial situations , foreign or domestic . 
  you got ta stop letting south americans hold you down . 
  the world needs mexico . 
  the s-400 has a range of 120km . 
  it ca n't affect anything in donbass from crimea . 
  * they chose poorly . 
  * / swedish tourism ad . 
  on issues that do n't involve our federal constitution , it is a sovereign state . 
  no , texas has . 
  our constitution is a rather minimalist document . 
  it was designed to allow states to develop their own way . 
  that 's one reason it 's lasted over 200 years , when few other countries have been able to go more than two or three generations without a collapse or revolution , or a period of totalitarian rule . 
  ... more weapons ? 
  i said money already , did n't i ? 
  those really do n't qualify as problems , no . 
  but a nation of 8 million ca n't exactly have the abundance of problems we have . 
  it 's like comparing vermont and california . 
  or vermont and europe , for that matter . 
  taking crime statistics , we do have states with lower murder rates than canada , and canada has provinces with higher murder rates than the us . 
  you 're talking about a diverse enough group in either case that statistical averages really start to blur the truth . 
  we are * at worst * a [ chaotic neutral empire . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empire_of_liberty ), 
  [ you called america an * evil empire * one hour ago . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4xc7sm/vladimir_putin_is_using_kgb_tactics_in_crimea/d6en22m ) you do n't hate * evil empires ? 
  * and it 's pretty far from realistic . 
  lay off the globalresearch before it kills your brain . 
  three people have been executed by the federal government since 1963 . 
  why not ? 
  you 're an american , and you hate america and love russia . 
  here ? 
  only an american could be that anti-american . 
  jsyk , * some * of the united states have the death penalty . 
  others have outlawed it since the 1800s . 
  i do n't know where you live , but please do n't project it onto the rest of us . 
  well , we 're already giving them money , and weapons . 
  trial would be impossible ; [ wars of aggression ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_of_aggression ) were not actually illegal until 2010 ( a new rule added because of us ) . 
  the only leader who could be tried for it would be putin . 
    ready to give their lives to help defend korea  how lucky for you it has n't been tested . 
  it has been tested . 
  in the korean war . 
  they passed the test . 
  what are you actually saying , that they would n't fight ? 
  i think that 's when you have to admit that your anti-americanism has jumped the shark . 
  you have n't answered the questions . 
  if you care so much more about liberty , where are you defending it ? 
  and what are europe 's interests ? 
  you 're forcing me to compare them . 
  you were commenting about us not being sanctioned . 
  what would be the objective of such sanctions ? 
  the objective of the russian sanctions was to pressure russia to withdraw from territory it had seized . 
  but we have n't taken any territory . 
  iraq is independent . 
  so what would be the point of sanctions ? 
  we 've kept an army of 30,000 in south korea for the past 63 years , 30,000 americans , ready to give their lives to help defend korea against the worst dictatorship on earth . 
  for 63 years . 
  for 1/4 of our entire national existence , we 've been defending korea . 
  and that 's just one country . 
  if you care about liberty more than us , where are you defending it ? 
  what are your interests ? 
  yes , we abandoned the idea of neutrality . 
  because it 's a bad idea . 
  as elie wiesel , who was liberated from auschwitz before becoming an american citizen , said , `` neutrality helps the oppressor , never the victim . '', 
  and no , [ the us was founded for this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empire_of_liberty ) it 's only our strategy that 's changed . 
  see , that 's what you do n't understand about us . 
  100 years ago , when european nations were aggressive imperialists , the us was a neutral and isolationist country , without even a real army , committed to non-intervention in european and asian conflicts . 
  even after wwi , [ we went back to a strict policy of neutrality . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neutrality_acts_of_1930s ) we were n't interventionists . 
  we were actually a lot more like you are now . 
  and that was a mistake that led directly to ww2 . 
  we 're not repeating your mistakes . 
  if anything , you 're repeating ours . 
  we wo n't be sanctioned because we did n't invade them secretly with an army disguised as iraqi protesters , and iraq was n't annexed by the us as a federal territory . 
  it 's an independent country and when their elected leaders told us to leave , we did . 
  i was thinking an escaped habsburg cloning experiment , on the run from vienna . 
   religions and political ideologies also form cohesive groups based on shared values and principles , but they have nothing to do with civic nationalism . 
  they do in our case . 
  america is almost more of a [ religion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_religion ) than a country . 
  it 's certainly an ideology .
