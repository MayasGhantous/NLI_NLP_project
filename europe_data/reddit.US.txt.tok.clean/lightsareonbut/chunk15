  other examples of that kind of nationalism : the soviet union , the prc and maybe revolutionary france . 
   following your logic , every ideological common ground would be nationalistic in nature , but that is evidently not the case . 
  not every ideology , but every ideology that defines a country or people , sure . 
  this kind of statement always makes me appreciate how differently europeans understand the word * nationalism . 
  * to me , it 's completely obvious that european federalism is nationalism , just on a higher level than french or german nationalism - technically supernationalism , where your national or supernational identity is based on shared values and principles , which is what civic nationalism is all about . 
  and i appreciate it because it 's a lot like [ american nationalism , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_nationalism ) including the nascent flag worship . 
  when europeans ask about us craziness toward our flag , i just tell them to imagine it as the eu flag . 
  both flags represent an ideological commitment , as seen in this thread . 
  because both the eu and us have a very ideological kind of nationalism , in which your national identity is n't defined so much by who you are , as by what you believe . 
  ok , i have to ask . 
  what are europe 's interests ? 
  what are america 's ? 
  were n't you lecturing about george washington a few comments back ? 
  i 'll let you do it . 
  i 'm not a historian . 
  all i know is that the pentagon has gone through numerous simulations of an attempted russian takeover of latvia , and [ we lose every time . 
  ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/18/exclusive-the-pentagon-is-preparing-new-war-plans-for-a-baltic-battle-against-russia/ ) the conclusion our planners are reaching at present is that nato ca n't defend you under current circumstances , using military force alone . 
  a strong and influential european union is in america 's interest . 
  that 's why we 've always supported the eu , and why we support the pro-eu side of ukrainian politics , including euromaidan and the current leadership . 
  we want a world governed by liberal democracy and relatively free trade , and the eu promotes that . 
  our differences are fairly trivial . 
  if it was n't strategically necessary , then i might have a problem with such methods . 
  but i 'm not claiming any moral high ground . 
  i 'm just saying that it 's in our interest , and really everyone 's interest . 
  we do n't dominate the world . 
  are you dominated ? 
  no , you 're free and we 're trying to keep you that way . 
  but that requires a willingness to actually use the means at our disposal . 
  i 'm relaxed . 
  but really . 
  militarism is bad . 
  espionage is bad . 
  it 's like some people just do n't want to win . 
  i did n't actually say anything about moral standing , or morality . 
  i 'm fine with what i described because it seems strategically necessary . 
  it 's a very european attitude to think of strategy in moral terms . 
  you expect us to fight ww3 on your behalf , but you condemn our methods . 
  maybe you should just invite putin in and get it over with . 
   `` changing public opinion '' are actually offered as services all around the globe . 
  and that is hardly kgb tactic . 
  disinformation is not only a kgb tactic ; it was actually a kgb specialty . 
   implying us was n't the first . 
  really ? 
  who took over eastern europe in 1945 ? 
  what besides kneejerk anti-americanism can make you believe the us was the first to meddle in eastern europe ? 
   though i find it funny they have to twist and turn to find a way to link a spy organisation that disappeared before internet to today 's social networks . 
  putin was kgb . 
  that 's his background , training and outlook . 
  he took over crimea in with an army of soldiers disguised as protesters , complete with actors posing as tv news crews . 
  his objective was for it to be seen as a popular revolt . 
  it was pure kgb , subversion and misinformation . 
  there 's no twisting required for that analysis . 
  saying that if russia is supporting anti-europe elements , we should be supporting pro-europe elements , is n't whataboutism . 
  it 's strategy . 
  it 's the same thing . 
  we 've always supported the eu because their interests are the same as ours , mostly . 
   the us seems untrustworthy . 
  we supported the euromaidan movement in ukraine because they were pro-europe and we want to strengthen europe , and facilitate the spread of its liberal democracy in ukraine . 
  so , untrustworthy , yes and no . 
  you can trust us to act according to what we believe is in europe 's interests . 
   so if someone of ` higher moral standing '' starts meddling in your countries affairs because of the drug war , nsa spying , death penalty and so on its perfectly fine ? 
  basically , yes . 
  as [ the link i posted above ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7 ) demonstrates , russia is already meddling in our internal politics , and [ they have been for a very long time . 
  ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/26/putin-s-wicked-leaks-didn-t-start-with-the-dnc.html ) other countries like china and israel are always subverting us in many ways : soft power , overt lobbying , espionage , cyberwarfare and psychological warfare ( disinformation is russia 's specialty ) . 
  the kind of meddling i 'm ok with was the kind we did in ukraine : giving financial and material support to the euromaidan movement , funding anti-corruption campaigns ( because fighting corruption meant fighting yanukovych and putin ) and eavesdropping on everyone . 
  because russia was also meddling in ukraine , just as they 're meddling in all eastern european countries . 
  if they 're trying to manipulate our elections , you should have no illusions about whether they 're trying to manipulate europe 's . 
  knowing that , i doubt non-interference on our part would be good for anyone . 
  he 's been using kgb tactics everywhere , including [ in the united states . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7 ) this is why i 'm fine with us meddling in other countries ' internal affairs . 
  because it 's clear that russia is , and will be even if we 're not . 
  [ he 's openly advocating for the green party . 
  ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/8/julian_assange_on_the_green_partys ) and for the record , jill stein , the green party candidate , almost make trump look sensible . 
  her vp candidate calls bernie sanders a capitalist imperialist and says he 's devoted his life to `` fighting this corrupt , degenerate , white supremacist monstrosity called the united states . '', 
  on the contrary , it 's not irrelevant . 
  you were commenting about the way attitudes about assange have changed over the years . 
  i 'm explaining why my attitude has changed . 
  i 'm realizing that he 's not the idealist he first appeared to be . 
  he 's more of a dangerous troll . 
  look at what he 's doing in this election . 
  he 's not releasing general information about the government , based on a purely idealistic belief in transparency . 
  he 's specifically releasing information that harms clinton and the democratic party . 
  these are politically motivated leaks . 
  and it does n't change my vote for clinton , no , because i vote based on policy , and i 'd rather have a corrupt president than an anti-nato president . 
  if assange succeeds in preventing her presidency , a lot of people could die as a result . 
  in any event , it wo n't be a beneficial outcome for america or europe . 
  i believe he 's being extremely irresponsible and so , yes , my attitude about him has changed . 
  is the [ impersonation ] ( https://cdn.opendemocracy.net/files/imagecache/article_xlarge/wysiwyg_imageupload/500209/adrian%20zandberg_photo.jpg ) of [ philip ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:philip_ii_of_spain_by_antonio_moro.jpg ) deliberate , or just a freakish coincidence ? 
  they can carry explosives . 
  years ago , it was possible to believe he was motivated by ideals . 
  now , it 's more apparent that he just does n't consider the consequences of his actions . 
  when bill maher asked him why he released all of clinton 's emails , he answered , because `` it was fun '' . 
   maybe we can figure something out like acknowledging the athlete 's origin in member state . 
  you could do that with uniforms . 
  a combination of eu colors and member state colors . 
  i said based on ideas , instead of ethnicity . 
   but then it would be ethnic nationalism [ our nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_nationalism ) is [ civic nationalism , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) not ethnic nationalism . 
  right . 
  having a european identity is about what you believe . 
  when you see the eu flag , you see ideals .
