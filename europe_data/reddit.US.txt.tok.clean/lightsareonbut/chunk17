  even if he 's elected , his ideas are n't supported by either party and will never be approved by congress . 
  you 're both disappointing . 
  arguing that europe does n't have the capacity to eclipse the us in every way is as ridiculous as saying that we wo n't go to war over estonia . 
  we have forces in estonia . 
  if estonia is ever attacked , we 'll already be at war . 
   us attention in foreign affairs is devoted to american wars and terrorism in the broader middle east that could have been phrased better . 
  america will never leave europe voluntarily . 
  but even in the us , they 're just supremely entitled racists . 
  the black lives matter movement ( the 70 organizations affiliated with them ) just recently published their list of demands , including [ ' a guaranteed minimum livable income for all black people . 
  ' ] ( https://policy.m4bl.org/reparations/ ) their actual demand is that all black americans be paid a permanent , livable income by the rest of us , just for being black . 
  how dare they appropriate our culture . 
  and then they kept on fighting to keep minorities from having rights for another 100 years , and even to this day . 
   what other country , in the history of the world has actually fought a civil war for the betterment and freedom of an enslaved minority ? 
  half of it did . 
  the other half fought for the exact opposite . 
  but that 's not really evidence . 
  it 's just saying ` it ca n't be coincidental , therefore nato . ', 
  i think it was more of a conspiracy of individuals than organizations . 
  just as there were some in the greek military and intelligence services who supported the coup , and others who did n't , it seems there were some in the cia office who did . 
  but [ president johnson seems to have opposed it , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_military_junta_of_1967%e2%80%9374#the_king.27s_counter-coup ) according to memoirs . 
  the truth hurts , does n't it ? 
  and that 's why we 've basically legalized bribery ? 
  please stop making excuses . 
  neither party appeals to a wide swath of the population . 
  the democrats and republicans each manage to appeal to about 20-30 % of the electorate . 
  the other half does n't even vote . 
  they do n't vote because they have no viable choices . 
  our first-past-the-post voting system and our two-party monopoly enforce each other . 
  until we have preferential voting , no one other than democrats and republicans will ever win in america . 
  it 's structural . 
  but i actually think there 's reason for optimism . 
  trump is getting crushed , and his staff are reported as ` suicidal . ', 
  the republican party has basically shot itself in the head by nominating an actual crazy person for president . 
  they 're probably going to drag our two-party system down with them . 
  are you trolling ? 
  if anyone needs to get their credibility back , it 's us . 
  we 're barely even a democracy and everyone knows it . 
  the account was created yesterday , specifically for trolling on this sub . 
  / u/theusasavedeurope new account , troll name ... 
  that 's exactly what they have done . 
  their evidence is being reviewed . 
  that was actually a terrible mistake . 
  removing saddam then , in one swift operation , would have been better for everyone than the un sanctions and bombings that went on throughout the 1990s and left the country poor and radical . 
  i did n't call anyone individually a putinbot . 
  [ and believe it or not , they are indeed doing this .

  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html ), 
  poroshenko says it on facebook . 
  the problem with the whole ` coup ' idea is : 1 . 
  the president abandoned the country of his own free will . 
  parliament immediately scheduled new elections , which were monitored by international observers and accepted by everyone , including putin . 
  i read it . 
  i 'm just saying that that blog is what 's called * dezinformatsiya . 
  * it 's been russian policy for 75 years to use misinformation to divide the rest of us . 
  [ here 's a better account of america 's role in the 2014 revolution . 
  ] ( http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/22758-meet-the-americans-who-put-together-the-coup-in-kiev ) summary : yes , we were involved , but most of what we did was helping the ( pro-eu ) protest movement organize through social media , establishing streaming websites ( which , later , made it possible for people to watch yanukovych 's troops firing into crowds ) and funding anti-corruption activists ( fighting corruption means fighting yanukovych and putin ) . 
   yes , there was no coup at all , really . 
   http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/12/head-stratfor-private-cia-says-overthrow-yanukovych-blatant-coup-history.html let 's look at some other headlines from that blog : * nato targets russia with poland-based missile shield * obama requests support for possible war against russia * nato says it might now have grounds to attack russia * obama ratchets-up to invade russia * us now overtly at war against russia * america 's one-party government * how corrupt america is * america has become a lawless nation * america 's & nato 's outrageous behavior , greatest threat that exists regardless of what some crackpot thinks , what happened in ukraine was an election , not a coup . 
  if ` slava ukraini ' is offensive , you should probably tell the canadian prime minister to stop saying it . 
  the fact that the berkut conspired with russia is well known . 
  in crimea , they were seizing checkpoints before the russians parachuted in . 
  it 's clear that the operation had been planned for some time . 
  do you need to ask ? 
  of course it 's putinbots . 
   a coup government was installed there was no coup . 
  yanukovych fled , to avoid being arrested and tried for murder . 
  parliament scheduled new elections , which resulted in poroshenko becoming president two months later . 
  and that happened because yanukovych was a putinist toady who used russian soldiers to murder ukrainian protesters , with putin 's help and probably on putin 's orders , as part of a larger plot to take over ukraine and annex crimea . 
  the part i said is just a basic expression of patriotism , akin to * vive la france . 
  * fascists do say it , but so does everyone else , including airline flight attendants , pro-eu social democrats ( including poroshenko ) and american embassy staff . 
   nowhere do they correlate the war with economic downfall . 
  * `` the conflict in the east has become the main driving force behind the fall , '' the report said .

  [ well , some of that 's already the * european * union . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42hs4ntqnla ) [ and some is already ours ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x0l5jxxaiq ) the rest , we 've tried , but they keep resisting . 
  i mean the thing where we conceptualize our future based on what 's happening on the other side of the ocean :  the north american union ( nau ) is a theoretical economic and political union of canada , mexico , and the united states . 
  the concept is loosely based on the european union , occasionally including a common currency called the amero, 
  [ we do it too . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_union ), 
   europe takes the brunt of the force . 
  correct . 
  even though europe largely did n't join us in iraq , it 's still being affected by it . 
  even france and germany , who chose to remain neutral , are considered ` crusader europe ' by islamists . 
  so , what does that tell us ? 
  it tells us that there 's no such thing as neutrality in the modern world . 
  we 're all connected on this planet , and what happens in other countries affects you whether you take sides in their conflicts or not . 
  so it 's to your advantage to take sides . 
  i would n't presume to know what 's best for europe , but a single military also means a single commander-in-chief , a single head of state , a single foreign policy and a single voice in world diplomacy . 
  it leads to a lot of things , both military and non-military . 
  imho anyway . 
  well , there 's no question about congress approving that crap . 
  neither party is going to vote to abandon our alliances , trade treaties , the wto , the basis of our global power and send is back to the stone age . 
  if trump is elected , he 'll be a one-term president . 
  unfortunately , i suspect he will be elected . 
  my patriotism is basically dead . 
  it 's some comfort that congress would never approve any of that . 
  even republican leaders call him an imbecile . 
  no special treatment required . 
  we want free trade with both the uk and eu . 
  i was responding more to the tone of the message .
