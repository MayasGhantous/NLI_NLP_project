  the united states has free trade agreements with every other member of the five eyes . 
  in addition to that , the uk is the largest foreign investor in the us , and the us is the largest foreign investor in the uk . 
  it 's 100 % certain that we 'll want an fta with them . 
  so , the representative 's statement ( ` the united states will be prepared to engage in conversations with the united kingdom about how to develop our trade and investment relationship in the best way and at the appropriate time . ' ), 
  seems rather cold and noncommittal . 
  it 's depressing that we are n't being more supportive . 
  are we still hoping they 'll change their minds or something ?

  he has a neck . 
  he 's just feeling depressed . 
  so , british . 
   and british intervention in iraq was ? 
  it was the result of the blair government 's ` new imperialism ' agenda :  ` what is needed is a new kind of imperialism , one compatible with human rights and cosmopolitan values : an imperialism which aims to bring order and organisation but which rests today on the voluntary principle . ', 
   https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/07/1 you 're falling for a case of popular revisionism . 
  the uk was n't dragged into iraq . 
  [ the blair government was all about military intervention . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tony_blair#military_intervention_and_the_war_on_terror ) edit : and the us definitely would have preferred hong kong to remain british , but if you think we could have affected that outcome at all , you 're overestimating our abilities . 
  i mean we have the same geopolitical agenda . 
  which means we agree with them , in addition to them agreeing with us . 
   when egypt took back suez the americans decided they could have it and they had it pretty much the entire planet was against them ( and france ) on that . 
  and they also refused to help us in vietnam . 
  we ca n't force the uk to cooperate with us , any more than we can force france or germany . 
  it just happens to be the case that our interests usually line up , which is n't surprising since we basically have the same culture and agenda . 
   the usa , china , eu and india are major powers . 
  well , they do have a larger gdp than india , and a stronger navy than india or china . 
  and the other five eyes countries already have free trade with each other , so they wo n't get unfavorable deals from us . 
  that will happen when we have a better voting system . 
  as long as it 's first-past-the-post , we 'll always have to vote strategically and will never have anything but those two parties . 
  the fact is that our constitution is the world 's oldest still in use , and is really starting to show its age . 
  that sounds so nice . 
  25 % of canadian households own at least one legal gun . 
  45 % in the states . 
  we have a winner . 
  examples ? 
  the region has a lot more going on , as always . 
  wow , that image looks sci-fi . 
  brexit 2 : this time , it 's for real . 
  [ time will convince you . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/independence-for-the-kurds-is-only-a-matter-of-time-a6990266.html ), 
   in fact , we warned pretty much everyone that it will end in a shitstorm . 
  you were wrong , though . 
  iraqi kurdistan will be democratic , secular and free . 
  the rest of iraq may end up a satellite of iran , but that 's for them to decide . 
  edit : and i agreed with you at the time , and i was also wrong . 
   do you think he is a sociopath ? 
  he has some strange self-confidence issues . 
  look at how he talked about his hand/penis size . 
  i do n't think he is a real sociopath . 
  they normally do n't have problems with self-confidence . 
  well , you 're right , it 's probably more like narcissistic personality disorder in his case ( and some of the country 's leading psychiatrists have already said as much ) . 
  wearing his hair in an incredibly elaborate three-way comb-over to hide his baldness , getting upset over the size of his hands , claiming to be 10 times as wealthy as he actually is , etc. 
  but narcissists and sociopaths are alike in that they only want to manipulate people into giving them what they want . 
  the * worst * thing that could happen would be if nato countries made some announcement between now and the election about increasing their rate of spending . 
  the fact that reuters even calls it a ` plan ' is why we 're all fucked . 
  the author of trump 's autiobiography ( he did n't write his own autobiography ) came right out last month and said he does n't really have any plans except to enrich himself and is actually just a sociopath . 
  the only reason he talks about abandoning nato is the same reason he talks about renegotiating nafta and building a wall across mexico . 
  they 're not ` plans ' , they 're a sociopath saying whatever will get him what he wants , but most of his voters do n't even know what sociopathy is , and of course reuters is n't going to inform them because oh dear , that would be rude . 
   and clinton has clear criminal , war-mongering tendencies . 
  [ the guy who ( actually ) wrote trump 's autobiography has come right out and said that he 's insane and that if we elect him , we 're all going to die .

   which is why this wont happen . 
  this sport is really only historic to western europe . 
  historically accurate or not , [ here 's japan vs germany last year .

   heres a [ list ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/a-timeline-of-cia-atrocities/5348804 ) http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/globalresearch, 
  [ this time it 's true . 
   operation ajax was successful and it give us tadaaa today 's iran . 
  they overthrew the democratically elected pm of iran and replaced them with an oppressive dictator who led to today 's f * cked up iran . 
  you 're leaving out the part where the democratically elected prime minister abolished parliament and declared himself a dictator , with a referendum he won by an amazing 99.99 % of the vote . 
  ` democratically elected ' and ` democratic ' are n't the same thing . 
  really ? 
  we did the libyan civil war ? 
  that was a lifetime ago , and we usually just played a supporting role . 
  maybe i 'm biased , but i think a us-backed coup would have succeeded . 
  [ and we do n't usually try to destabilize governments that are working with us . 
  ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-compromises-won-turkeys-backing-for-kurdish-led-offensive-1468539313 ), 
  we could n't even afford to do something like that again , so do n't worry about it . 
  if you ask on / r/kurdistan , / r/iraq or / r/afghanistan , you wo n't find many people who think the invasion was a bad idea . 
  if your country were ruled by a dictator or a terrorist network , you 'd be glad for an invasion . 
  the problem is all the bad decisions that were made before and after , by americans , iraqis and afghans . 
  anyway , you 've already won . 
  that was 13 years ago and it severely damaged interventionism in america . 
  we 're not doing anything like that again for a long time . 
  one difference is that when we invade a country , it does n't hold a referendum in which it votes by 90 % to be annexed by the united states . 
  in iraq 's case , it becomes a democracy that tells us to gtfo , and we do , and then it kinda falls apart and we have to come back to try to help . 
  we 're not ` good guys , ' but if you think we 're doing the same thing as russia , maybe you could benefit from a closer examination of the situation . 
  and it 's not about oil . 
  the us has 30,000 troops in south korea , and has had them there for 63 years . 
  we 've spent 1/4 of our national lifetime defending south korea . 
  south korea has no oil . 
  you 're right that a normal country does n't do this , and we actually kind of wish they would , because it 's very expensive .
