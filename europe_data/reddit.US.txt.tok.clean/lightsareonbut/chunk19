  but they have their own beliefs and friends do n't always agree . 
   or you could have just left an independent country alone to rule itself and deal with its own problems we tried that , and poland got invaded . 
  i do n't know if you know this , but until the last world war , the united states was a dogmatically neutral and isolationist country , with no army , and no involvement in foreign conflicts . 
  between 1790 and 1916 , the us never had a single alliance or was involved in any foreign war . 
  even after ww1 , it went back to that policy . 
  but that was wrong , and if it had abandoned that attitude earlier , ww2 would never have happened . 
  so now we have allies , and we get involved . 
  that and mad are a large part of the reason there has n't been another war . 
  we actually already have free trade agreements with everyone else , except nz , which is in the works . 
  / u/heknarf :  honestly , the usa/uk/australia / canada/nz/ireland ( eh ? ), 
  anglosphere should have taken steps long ago to pool their cultural and economic power in a more official manner . 
   it 's ridiculous that we have n't . 
  maybe ridiculous , but not surprising . 
  we 're all rather fond of our independence . 
  and do n't forget [ jamaica ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/09/jamaicans-love-britain-island-reject-independence ) and the west indies . 
  ... our money has an egyptian pyramid beneath a levitating eye and the words ` new world order . ', 
  interesting times ... 
  at the same time , if they learned more about our history together , they would feel closer to us . 
   although u/whitepalms85 has a point , the things he mentions would generally lead someone into petty crimes - such as theft - but certainly not into attacking 21 people with an ax while shouting `` god is great . '', 
  i do n't know about that . 
  from the issues we have with teenagers who go crazy and decide to start killing people , it seems this can happen to westerners too . 
  the fact that it 's always white male teenagers conforms to / u/whitepalms85 's idea about expectations versus experiences . 
  i suppose one difference between your grandparents and u/jorgegt 's grandparents and this young man is that the greek and spanish civil wars were n't blamed on the countries your grandparents sought refuge in . 
  islamists are taught to blame all the problems of their countries on westerners , including ` crusader europe . ', 
  and then they go live in western countries and they see how much better off everyone is . 
  it must be maddening . 
  and i 'm just going to say it : westerners widely support their blame-shifting . 
  especially in germany and france , where all of the middle east 's problems ( including is ) are attributed to western intervention . 
   its hard to check personal beliefs bacon sandwich . 
  til . 
   current russian actions are n't that of an imperialist but that of a country trying to free itself from a military choke by kicking and shoving . 
  that 's what 's happend in georgia and that 's what 's happening now in ukraine . 
  there 's a difference between threatening a swift defensive reaction and putting missile sites and having `` military exercises '' at russian borders . 
  that 's just their excuse . 
  look at the map . 
  russian missile subs already have the united states encircled and can obliterate us several times over . 
  putin is n't feeling threatened by us or nato . 
  he just wants to anschluss his neighbors and be the tough guy in russian politics who stands up to the evil west , and that 's all . 
   iran being iran as it is right now can have only americans playing puppet master to blame if anything , what the islamists have done to iran is proof that we should have supported the [ previous government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_revolution ) more strongly than we did . 
  russian imperialism existed long before nato . 
  nato does n't expand itself . 
  countries * join * nato voluntarily for protection against russia . 
  iran is trying to take over iraq because they 're an expansionist theocracy that wants to unite all shia muslims against saudi arabia . 
  they would have done this whether we were involved or not , because this is their agenda . 
  other countries have agendas . 
  and russia is also selling weapons to saudi arabia and iran . 
  they 're arming both sides . 
  the israeli-palestinian conflict has been going on since 1948 because of their own issues . 
  the syrian civil war and turkey 's coup happened because of syrian and turkish issues . 
  kurds are trying to form their own state because they 've been fighting for it for a hundred years . 
  everyone has objectives and they 're all willing to use force to achieve them . 
  it 's not a peaceful planet . 
  without nuclear deterrence , what do you really think it would look like ? 
  corbyn has said that it 's ` immoral ' to possess nuclear weapons and that he 's totally opposed to their use and committed to their worldwide abolition . 
  racist . 
  ours meet the aliens first , that way they understand their objectives . 
  peace is an ideal . 
  believing that abolishing nuclear weapons would lead to peace is wishful thinking . 
   annoying point is that turkey always have seen ` buffer zone ' ` outpost ' geographical ` point ' . . never be alliance , friend . . [ in the us , turkey is constantly referred to as a strong ally . 
  ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2016/04/11/turkey-is-an-indispensable-u-s-ally/ ) it 's hard to say ` friend , ' since we do n't have a very close relationship . 
  but turkey has a military reputation and ` great power ' outlook that americans understand and respect . 
  it is said an eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence , to be ever in view , and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations . 
  they presented him the words : `` and this , too , shall pass away . '', 
  you 're not sorry . 
  i do n't see your point . 
  that 's an argument for building up , surely ? 
  and we 're constantly lobbying our allies to increase their strength . 
  it 's not like they 're going to go around recolonizing africa with it . 
  the aliens !!, 
  they 're just waiting for the chance to take over belgium . 
  do you want that to happen ? 
  why do i know there are bodies hidden somewhere in this building ? 
  [ those new carriers are looking nice . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_elizabeth-class_aircraft_carrier ), 
  they 're letting us use the nazi stargate . 
  or whatever . 
  it 's classified . 
  well , when he says ` participation , ' he obviously ca n't mean participation in eu decision-making . 
  so i wonder what role he does mean . 
  i know it 's commonly thought that he has no plan , but he probably could n't tell us if he did . 
  half of / r/kurdistan is expecting to be killed because of this . 
  no one needed this . 
  so if it 's a carrier , why do they call it a destroyer ? 
  why do they call all their ships destroyers ? 
  you do realize that in japanese , they 're not actually called destroyers at all , right ? 
  they 're referred to as \u8b77\u885b\u8266 ; or goei-kan . 
  this is just a generic term that means something like escort-ship . 
  that 's what they call all of their surface capital combat ships regardless of size , combat role or displacement . 
  i actually did know that , and it 's kind of the point . 
  they call all of their ships destroyers , or since we 're being technical , escort ships . 
  so what are they escorting ? 
  um ... look , we all enjoy a good internet nerd fight , but this is trivial , right ? 
  you agree that it 's a helicopter carrier , right ? 
  and that they call it a destroyer for legal reasons ? 
  the jews could n't even stop us from sending jewish refugees back to germany . 
   different countries define ships along different lines ; what one country calls a frigate would be classed as a destroyer by another for example . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asagiri-class_destroyer ) is a japanese destroyer , displacement 4,900 tons . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/js_izumo_%28ddh-183%29_just_after_her_launch.jpg ) is the izumo , displacement 27,000 tons . 
  if it 's a destroyer , it 's by far the largest destroyer ever built . 
   kurdistan is a small part of iraq .
