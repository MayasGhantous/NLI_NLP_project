  i 'm only saying that separatism is n't even a remote possibility . 
  it 's a basic misunderstanding of our nationalism . 
  we do n't have breakaway regions like that . 
  however , that does n't mean they 're not trying . 
  pishevar does have connections to moscow , and rt is pushing the story , lusting for the dream of american dissolution . 
  the protocols of the elders of zion were just made up . 
  this is a book written by alexander dugin , advisor to the state duma , close ally of putin and founder of eurasianism . 
  that 's shervin pishevar , who is a naturalized immigrant and not an american by birth . 
  there 's no such thing as actual separatism in the united states . 
  the idea is ludicrous enough to prove that whoever wrote this text has no familiarity with us at all . 
  racism is a more achievable end , of course , but that also fits with someone who only knows us from television . 
  and yes of course helping putin veto un authorization for iraq was a totally smart move . 
  because who would benefit from un-mandated democracy in iraq , anyway ? 
  and putin wants a true partnership with europe . 
  he 's not just taking advantage of you to further his own expansionist ambitions . 
  i changed it back . 
  i mean , sure it 's a ruthless one-party dictatorship threatening to annex taiwan on a weekly basis , is claiming an entire sea with gunboat diplomacy , is supplying north korea , and is determined to undermine the spread of democracy and harvests protesters for their organs , but on the other hand , climate talks !, 
  seriously ? 
  no , this is n't what most americans want at all . 
  there 's simply a lot of misinformation . 
  there 's a difference between not wanting an alliance and being part of an alliance but refusing to honor it . 
  they do n't want america to actually dishonor its existing treaties , which is what trump has said . 
  trump himself does n't even know what he 's saying . 
  hollande said before the election that trump makes him vomit . 
  it 's definitely not just france . 
  we can already be sure that it 's not * fine . 
  * the election of donald `` grab 'em by the pussy '' trump , the 45th president of the united states , is the end of an era . 
  we know that already . 
  the america we believed in is gone . 
  as for allies , no one can even trust us anymore . 
  the era of american leadership is over and done with . 
  we 're finished . 
  he changed his mind because russia at the time was ruled by alexander ii , a.k.a. 
  the liberator . 
  [ lincoln changed his mind later . 
  ] ( http://www.voltairenet.org/article169488.html ), 
  [ no , we do n't . 
  ] ( http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/gallupspaces/production/cms/poll/fq5wdqzxh0owu5fomwsljg.png ) we do n't have that kind of animosity . 
  and we do n't have allies either , not anymore . 
  it 's over . 
  ... i ca n't tell if you 're being serious . 
  you do n't think the left has bigotry ? 
  we do n't feel that way at all . 
  and it hardly matters anymore , does it ? 
  we do n't even have allies now . 
  we 're finished . 
  `` all the bigots voted for trump '' is a statement that pretty much disproves itself . 
  no political party is completely free of bigots . 
  this way of interpreting politics is part of the problem . 
  i wish i could see how it gets better . 
  what makes you think he 'll even last until next time ? 
  remember khizr khan ? 
  trump is a mentally ill narcissist with the mind of a child . 
  he stays awake until 5am calling people names on twitter . 
  none of his ideas are even serious ideas , and congressional republicans are opposed to 90 % of them . 
  and how much dirt is going to come to light about him in the next few months alone ? 
  we 're going to spend the next several years watching our party system collapse and then rebuilding afterward . 
  who on cnn actually praised the electoral college ? 
  i 've never heard any american say it was anything other than a pointless holdover from another era . 
  edit : but yes , all of that 's true , but it 's not exactly unprecedented . 
  we 're in our sixth party system . 
  the [ previous five ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth_party_system ) collapsed , and never without turmoil . 
  our innate love of freedom ? 
  you know , we 're only the most powerful country because everyone else wrecked themselves and each other . 
  it 's kind of flattering that you think we have some immunity . 
  the author 's biography :  linas kojala is the director of the eastern europe studies centre , a think tank in vilnius , lithuania and lecturer at institute of international relations and political science , vilnius university . 
  what we know : congress is very pro-nato . 
  this is the same congress who voted 98 % to supply ukraine , over obama 's veto . 
  what we do n't know : whatever the fuck trump is thinking . 
  what he said on the campaign was pretty incoherent . 
  it was nice while it lasted . 
  it will only last for four years , though . 
  i 'd guess not even half that long . 
   yes , unfortunately , he enjoys the popular support , but then again , even trump of all people managed to get a lot votes recently , even though the latter is a bit of a buffoon . 
  [ guess who had something to do with that . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7 ), 
  i got that , and i suppose it is , although it 's embarrassing to be in the group of nations who get these lectures ( again ) . 
  ugh , i just realized that our media is going to be in the same meltdown mode as the post-brexit uk 's for a while . 
  it may have been our worst election in 200 years , but that does n't mean we 're not a democracy . 
  turnout was only 55.6 % . 
  general apathy and enthusiasm on the other side decided the election . 
  of course it 's about policy plans . 
  do you think democrats have been telling those people the truth ? 
  they 've just been lying to them for the past 16 years . 
  someone needs to tell them that their jobs and their way of life are never coming back , and that they need to move to the cities and be part of the actually prosperous america , and give them help doing so . 
  with the truth . 
  this is / r/europe . 
  a man who 's actually promised that america will dishonor its treaty obligations and betray latvia if they 're invaded by russia has been elected president . 
  we 're patriots . 
  we do n't like our nation to be so disgraced . 
  if you cared as much as us about certain issues , you 'd be having a meltdown too . 
  i would n't say people like cruz dominate our political process . 
  it 's traditionally dominated by people like the clintons and bushes , who are basically moderate . 
  [ that 's pretty much it . 
  ] ( http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/ ) / u/jimofwales, 
  someone has to rebuild . 
  besides , they wo n't accept your refugees . 
  that 's like 70 % of the reason i linked to it . 
  [ i did n't mean it that way . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5byo2r/tonight_im_glad_i_live_in_europe/d9sf2hk/ ) it 's an old proverb .
