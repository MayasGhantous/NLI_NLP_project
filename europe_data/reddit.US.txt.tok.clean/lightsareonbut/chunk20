  of course the kurds were happy to see saddam go . 
  what about everyone else who lives in iraq ? 
  why not ask / r/iraq ? 
  in my experience , almost no one is sorry the invasion took place . 
  they 're just sorry we ( and frankly they ) fucked everything up afterward . 
   kurdistan is a small part of iraq . 
  of course the kurds were happy to see saddam go . 
  what about everyone else who lives in iraq ? 
  why do you think so many sunni-majority towns suddenly got taken over by is ? 
  violence ? 
  wait . 
  yes . 
  it was violence . 
  and intimidation . 
   kurdistan was already on a slow and steady path to de-facto independence and there was no need to invade iraq to make it happen . . bombings and diplomatic pressure would have been enough to keep things moving forward if saddam ever threw his toys out of the pram again . 
  you ca n't rush these kind of changes in a region like the middle east . 
  maybe you 're right . 
  this is what i basically thought at the time . 
  but you 're not really arguing against intervention . 
  you 're just saying bombing them and meddling in their internal politics would have been sufficient . 
  so you 're saying there was not enough libert\u00e9 and fraternit\u00e9 . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helicopter_carrier https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_aircraft_carriers_in_service japan does n't even call them helicopter carriers . 
  they 're called destroyers . 
  the reason is because the jmsdf is explicitly banned from having aircraft carriers . 
  i think this was the tipping point :  china is trying , without much success , to put together a ` coalition of the willing ' france : oh no you did n't . 
  here 's an idea . 
  why do n't you go over to / r/kurdistan and explain to the people there why you believe they should have been left under saddam ? 
   there is no way in hell this is true . 
  the us only had one major terrorist attack . 
  [ actually , we 've had a few . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_islamist_terrorist_attacks ) i think we do have the record for western countries ( other than israel ) , but correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  most countries would call them helicopter carriers , which are a category of aircraft carrier . 
   you do realize that isis rose directly out of our actions in iraq ? 
  it rose out of our mistakes in iraq . 
  stupid mistakes like disbanding the iraqi army and leaving tens of thousands of men without jobs in a time of upheaval , and not resisting when the iraqi government freed all the militants we 'd been detaining . 
  but avoidable mistakes . 
  and i 've talked to enough iraqis about it to conclude that the war itself was basically a good idea . 
   and that afghanistan is just as bad , if not worse off than before ? 
  how exactly ? 
   you complain that nato does n't pull its weight militarily , but how about you pay for all the refugees that your wars and destabilizations cause ? 
  i wish we were accepting more refugees . 
  it 's shameful that canada 's taking in more than us . 
   you go in , fuck everything up , go back to your precious safe island the us still holds the record for most civilians killed by terrorists , i think . 
  something europeans rarely seem to understand about the us is that until the last world war , it was actually a dogmatically neutral and isolationist nation , with no alliances and no involvements in foreign conflicts . 
  the reason we 're not like that anymore is because it does n't work . 
  taking sides in other peoples ' conflicts * might not * get us what we want , but it 's the only possible thing that * can * get us what we want . 
  in this case , stability and democracy in syria and iraq . 
  sitting inside our borders and hoping for things to get better on their own will only make things worse in the end . 
  of course we have to fight them . 
  syria and iraq must be made stable and democratic , or the problem will just keep getting worse . 
  but if islamic terrorism is the result of broad middle eastern culture and social/economic conditions beyond those two countries , then i 'm beginning to think it 's something that will actually never end in our lifetimes . 
  but 11 is still a tiny number . 
  this is n't a population , it 's extreme outliers . 
  it 's like using the super-geniuses of the population to characterize the group . 
  seems a bit pessimistic to me . 
  the article is suggesting that americans in particular will think johnson is a joke . 
  i mean , us . 
  the people who elected the governator . 
  i ca n't imagine how the guardian has arrived at that opinion . 
  iirc , johnson is fairly popular in the states already and his transatlantic contacts may have had something to do with his appointment . 
  then how come bill gates gets to call himself sir william gates , knight commander of the british empire ? 
  the truth is that the empire is still here . 
  we 're not ruled from london anymore , but us , canada , australia , nz and the uk are permanent allies , with the same policies on almost everything , and in most cases the same head of state . 
  and that will probably never change . 
  the uk has always been stuck between the european ` family of nations ' and the family it already has , and i suppose either one is difficult to let go . 
  longer , more recent video [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itajprrljwo ) so it 's not much , but i wanted to show . 
  love from usa . 
  actually , his whole face . 
  bad lighting maybe ? 
  [ * glares ... * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7qaiz2dqgy&amp;t=35s ), 
   i wonder how the rest of the world sees our parade . 
  after all , the same event in russia/china/best korea is often categorised as a display of power . 
  we do n't have military parades , and if we did , i would n't want to watch them . 
  i 'd think we were becoming too authoritarian . 
  but france 's does n't strike me that way at all , because after all , it 's france , and there are some nations you know will never go that way . 
   but sure , us and a few of its allies that it can strong arm into occasionally driving the ships through the region haha , it 's not us this time . 
  we 're just supporting our allies . 
  [ and actually , we 're trying to persuade them to be * less * aggressive . 
  ] ( http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-launches-quiet-diplomacy-to-ease-south-china-sea-tensions/articleshow/53205750.cms ) the $ 5 trillion in annual shipping that passes through those waters is enough to get anyone worked up . 
  i do n't think it 's about balls . 
  europe just tends to be preoccupied with its own affairs . 
  it 's hard to blame them , since their affairs are so complicated . 
  a united europe would be the strongest power on earth , but it 's still in the embryonic stage . 
  what you need is a single military , because that also means a single commander-in-chief , a single head of state , a single foreign policy and a single voice . 
  but the continent is like my cat . 
  he goes to the door and i open it for him , but then he ca n't decide whether he wants in or out . 
  they 're an inscrutable people . 
  also , aircraft carriers are illegal under their constitution . 
  eh , [ other countries ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/14/asia-pacific/politics-diplomacy-asia-pacific/china-protests-australias-south-china-sea-freedom-navigation-comment/#.v4guatwiuul ) are doing it too . 
  when they realize no one 's going to agree to their crazy demands , they 'll probably be willing to talk . 
  that was the international court of justice ( icj ) , a un agency . 
  the ruling in this case was made by the [ permanent court of arbitration , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/permanent_court_of_arbitration ) which is separate from the un . 
  also , the us never signed the un convention on the law of the sea , because freedom . 
  in fairness , they 're preoccupied . 
  besides , [ australia 's doing it . 
  ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/14/asia-pacific/politics-diplomacy-asia-pacific/china-protests-australias-south-china-sea-freedom-navigation-comment/#.v4gcitwiuuk ) and [ japan . 
  ] ( http://www.examiner.com/article/japanese-naval-ships-are-visiting-philippines-near-waters-disputed-with-china ) the japanese are even sending their new destroyers , [ which are totally not aircraft carriers . 
  ] ( http://theweek.com/articles/548082/china-right-alarmed-by-japans-new-helicopter-destroyer ) as much fun as it would probably be for european navies to join all of ours and have a party in china 's ` territory ' , [ that 's actually not what the us wants right now .
