  we 've literally never had fascism , or communism , or any other kind of totalitarianism . 
  our election schedule has n't been interrupted since the 1700s . 
  we 've never been anything but democratic and constitutional . 
  and yes * of course * the military would rebel if that changed .

  bravo . 
  i said it was an ot question . 
  ot , but why do you have a kurdistan flair ? 
  you 're not kurdish , are you ? 
  the result is several centuries of constitutional democracy . 
   ahh yes , as long as you bring up the buzzwords patriotism , freedom and national security you can sell whatever you want to the majority of american people . 
  sure , let 's just ignore sociological research showing that we have an extreme societal focus on the common good , and chalk it up to gullibility , shall we ? 
  the patriot act is n't undemocratic , because it was passed by congress - i.e. 
  by the people , in congress assembled . 
   all the talk about the greater good actually seems to support my point , national socialists and communists and the akp in turkey also had or have the greater good in mind . 
  the bad thing is that everyone has a different idea about what exactly the greater good is and whether the end justify the means . 
  the key to that phrase is , `` all * due * submission and obedience . '', 
  we do n't automatically obey the government . 
  we obey all laws passed by the people and judged legal by the judiciary appointed by the people . 
  against anything other than that , we have a duty to rebel . 
  you are misreading us . 
  here : http://www.bfna.org/media_advisory/u-s-social-cohesion-high-unaffected-by-immigration despite what we look like on tv , the us is a global leader in social cohesion . 
  we have one of the highest levels in the world , and * the * highest by some measurements . 
  as that article notes , one of those measurements is `` an extremely strong focus on the common good . '', 
  the patriot act is that . 
  it 's not the kind of authoritarianism you 're thinking of , it 's that common-good mentality , which you can see even in the wiki article i linked above . 
  as the mayflower compact put it , the government exists `` for the general good of the colony , unto which we promise all due submission and obedience . '', 
  we 're not currently in an autocratic state . 
  ffs , the patriot act is an act of congress . 
   which is a term i 've never in my life have heard here ... maybe because your country has no history of such diversity . 
  i mean , not to be insulting , but of course you would n't have heard such terms in sweden ; sweden was  95 % white a generation or two ago . 
  it 's not as if we think black people are another species . 
  race is a somewhat fluid thing ; anti-muslim sentiment is regularly called racism in the us as well . 
  a race is just a category of something , in this case people . 
    400 years  that number seems to be a bit off well , 397 years : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plymouth_colony#organization even dictatorships need some sense of legitimacy . 
  germany had the f\u00fchrer principle , based on centuries of monarchic traditions . 
  china and turkey have their own traditions . 
  in our hemisphere , the only acceptable basis for an undemocratic government is a state of emergency , which is why they 're always temporary . 
  pinochet and videla both left office when they were voted out . 
  although you 're right that a situation like russia 's is possible , but that requires a much more capable leader than donald trump . 
  well , obama being of mixed race and from a muslim immigrant background , raised partly in indonesia , makes him a bit of a fetish for the diversity-focused part of the political spectrum . 
  that 's what i meant in my original comment , though i just said `` black . '', 
  3 : you said `` we '' so i posted something ridiculous in swedish . 
  1 , 2 , 4 : there 's no need to be defensive . 
  i did n't say they were typical . 
  but to say race has no significance in scandinavian politics is equally untrue . 
  accusations of racism are nearly as common as in the us . 
  we really ca n't become a dictatorship . 
  we 've had democratic government for 400 years . 
  there 's no precedent for anything else . 
  if we ever had a dictatorship it would be like argentina 's , where a political crisis led to a military government , which lasted for 5 years until a civilian government was voted back in . 
  that 's the only kind of dictatorship that can exist on our continent . 
  i know what they said , but i do n't believe them . 
  he made no such extraordinary effort . 
  i think his identity had more to do with it than anything , and i do n't believe `` not being bush '' was sufficient . 
  admitting he was elected does n't change the fact that he 's an incompetent narcissist . 
  it 's difficult to articulate to a non-american why we hate him so much , but the fact that he 's incompetent and narcissistic is as plain as his face . 
  even after he won the republican nomination , less than 30 % of voters said on surveys that he was qualified to be president . 
  those who voted for him did so for a variety of reasons , imho none of them good . 
  edit : also , sorry you get downvoted for expressing your opinion . 
  obama got it because of scandinavians . 
  * omg a black president , let 's give him a prize . 
  * even obama joked that he still was n't sure why they gave it to him . 
  `` i know words . 
  i have the best words . '', 
  `` i have a very good brain . '', 
  he ca n't even speak like a human being . 
  he is quite obviously the most incompetent president we 've ever had . 
  not really - look at the dramatic decline in birth rates and marriage . 
  and it 's extremely secular . 
  i think westerners tend to exaggerate how traditional japan is because the traditions are different . 
  him being an incompetent narcissist is the main one . 
  [ @ 7:35 , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khcfalht0uw&amp;t=7m35s ) british ambassador : `` the whole earth shall belong to western countries ! '', 
  because his policies were naive disasters . 
  how 'd that iraq withdrawal go ? 
  how 'd that russian reset go ? 
  countries are plotted according to their answers to questions on the world values survey . 
  being close together means they have the same values . 
  oh , sorry , you were saying about jfk ? 
  39-year-old males typically are n't ready to be the president of france . 
  i mentioned obama because macron reminds me a lot more of obama than of jfk . 
  obama was 47 and he was far from ready . 
  my point is that ( imho ) he 's only going to push her numbers higher in the long run . 
  yeah , and meanwhile , i realize how much this sub loves macron but he 's 39 , inexperienced and seemingly inept . 
  i do n't see this working out well for france . 
   ** claims ** to use cutting-edge technology to build intimate psychometric profiles of voters the word `` claims '' seems important .
