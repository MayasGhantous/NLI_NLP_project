  it 's sad in a way , but we ca n't be a nation defined by blood . 
  the important thing is the spirit of adventure and the determination to build a better world , which all americans can claim in one way or another . 
  i 'm just guessing , but i 'd imagine that 's more than it was in the late 1600s . 
  the mayflower was just one ship and transported only 102 passengers . 
  but the longer our population mingles , the more everyone becomes related . 
   wasps i , too , enjoy ethnic slurs . 
  i was thinking more of the salem witch trials . 
  you think it might need a bigger flag ? 
  near as i can tell , bannon is just a straight-up old-school christian . 
  he talks about being a leninist in that he envisions a `` church militant '' as a kind of bolshevik vanguard that will transform our culture and politics back to what it was in the puritan days . 
  so he sees demographic change through those goggles , with maybe some southern white supremacy thrown in . 
  to me , that 's almost good news since it means he 's not a real threat - his plans for the future rely on miracles and wishful thinking . 
   bragging about `` that substantial guy '' just to show how much the french are going to miss out on it 's not to show france anything . 
  he 's saying this as an argument for banning immigration in the states , not as an insult to france . 
  same goes for his comments about sweden 's migrant situation . 
  yes and attributing all of cuba 's previous problems to murican influence . 
  spain and portugal were dictatorships back then , germany and italy were dictatorships , most of europe and the world were dictatorships . 
  dictatorship was common . 
  american corporations found it easy to exploit cuba thanks to its greedy and corrupt leaders , but saying `` cuba is better off without american influence '' is facile while puerto rico is actually a federal territory and has the highest per capita gdp in latin america . 
  logic has no power here . 
  we 're talking about cuba , and i 'm pointing out that ` murican cuba would have been governed like puerto rico . 
  that is all . 
  and again , it was n't ` murican . 
  if it had been , like puerto rico , it could not have become a dictatorship , because us constitution . 
  is 40 years most of the last century ? 
  try to focus . 
  and i did n't even mention pan . 
  anyone who denies that prd is a left-wing party is either an extreme leftist or someone with no idea what he 's talking about . 
  yes argentina has seasons , and most of it is humid subtropical . 
  what 's up with these answers ? 
  why do people need to argue with something like this ? 
   fertile crescent, 
  it was n't part of ` murica . 
  cuba and puerto rico were both `` liberated '' in the spanish american war , but puerto rico became a federal territory and puerto ricans became american citizens , unlike cuba . 
  mexico 's 2nd and 3rd largest parties are the institutional revolutionary party and the democratic revolution party , both members of the socialist international . 
  and brazil was a dictatorship for 20 years , chile 8 years , argentina 5 years , not most of the last century . 
  latin america , in general , was a lot more democratic in the last century than europe . 
  if you want to know what ` murican cuba would actually look like , see puerto rico . 
  italy , greece and iraq are your counterarguments ? 
  just to give one example of something completely beyond the power of politics to affect , countries with cold climates tend to have better economies , better health and longer life expectancy than countries with hot climates . 
  there 's been research showing that gdp can even be tied to temperature on a yearly basis : http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=106697286, 
  i mean latin america tends to be more left-wing than us , too - are they better off ? 
  there are other reasons for prosperity or the lack thereof . 
   about flag  about battle  about flag and battle ? 
  i mean nasa was quick to take credit , but the european team has actually taken its name . 
  the star was originally called [ 2mass j23062928-0502285 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trappist-1 ) when it was discovered by the university of massachusetts . 
  now the belgians have renamed it trappist-1 after their own project , which is named after a beer . 
  frigging armchair imperatores . 
  i mean i do n't agree with him , but when you 're talking about issues relating to immigration and asylum seekers , sweden is a natural reference point . 
  his comments about sweden are because he wants to ban immigration from middle eastern countries in the us . 
  pointing to the problems sweden 's had due to immigration is perfectly acceptable . 
  obama tried for years to get our european friends to take the world more seriously . 
  there 's no reason we should be the only rich country committed to the defense of south korea or taiwan . 
  we are not the world 's police force . 
  meanwhile , sweden + norway + denmark clustered together , australia + nz+uk clustered together , estonia + latvia + lithuania clustered together ... there 's obviously some truth to it . 
  you can say `` quell your conscience , '' and i can just as easily say `` avoid responsibility . '', 
  it 's your region . 
  should n't you be keeping it at peace ? 
  besides , france , italy and the uk led the way in the libyan intervention and france [ wanted to intervene against assad ] ( http://freebeacon.com/national-security/obama-furious-clinton-criticizing-foreign-policy/ ) until obama refused :  prime minister of france manuel valls told goldberg that `` by not intervening early , we have created a monster . 
  we were absolutely certain that the u.s. administration would say yes . 
  working with the americans , we had already seen the targets . 
  it was a great surprise . 
  if we had bombed as was planned , i think things would be different today . '' it 's not as if we 've been the only aggressors . 
  nope : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inglehart%e2%80%93welzel_cultural_map_of_the_world#/media/file:inglehart-welzel_2015.jpg discussion : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5vnzv7/til_that_the_world_values_survey_has_been_used_to/, 
   the subject from the start was comparing crime in the us and sweden . 
  no , the subject is trump 's comments about crime and immigration in sweden , without reference to the us . 
  do n't be a troll . 
  talking about crime on another continent ? 
  the issue is whether immigration in sweden has led to an increase in crime , and to what extent . 
  pointing to the us crime rate and saying `` ours is n't as high '' is changing the subject . 
  between 1962 and 2015 , the number of black adults who 've completed high school increased [ from 25 % to 93 % . 
  ] ( http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/08/28/racial_income_gap_as_big_as_ever_with_wealth_gap_even_larger/high%20school%20gap.png.crop.article568-large.png ) the hispanic number went [ from 57 % to 77 % ] ( https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=27 ) between 1995 and 2015 alone . 
  it 's not like things are n't getting better , but it 's likely to be a long time before we can call them solved . 
  will you really ? 
  because it does n't look that way . 
  it seems that you prefer to change the subject . 
  did you notice this part ? 
   civilian noninstitutionalized population it [ does n't include ] ( https://factfinder.census.gov/help/en/civilian_noninstitutionalized_population.htm ) members of the military , incarcerated persons , students living in university housing , etc. 
  and , well . 
  spain 's foreign-born population is 13 % now , but [ in 2000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_spain ) it was 2 % , and in 1991 it was < 1 % . 
  mass immigration is still fairly new to spain . 
  eww , thanks for the warning on cis . 
  but i looked up the data via the census bureau and it seems to be accurate in this instance . 
  you can see it [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.census.gov/data/tables/2013/demo/foreign-born/cps-2013.html ), 
  i 'll accept that statistic , but it might be out of date . 
  the adult population was 16.7 % foreign-born [ in 2013 . 
  ] ( https://www.numbersusa.com/news/us-foreign-born-population-hits-record-413-million ) edit :  edit : actually i would say that race is only cultural in the us ; it 's kind of a self-accomplished prophecy . 
  tell to a black french that he has a different culture than his paler compatriots . 
  maybe because france is different ? 
  black people in france were n't enslaved for 200 years ? 
  there are no pre-indo-european native people still around ? 
  54 million americans ( 17 % ) are foreign-born . 
  a majority of americans have immigrant parents or grandparents or are immigrants themselves . 
  and race is cultural , not just about melanin content . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm not criticizing you , just saying that your government more or less wanted to be an example to the world by taking in so many refugees and asylum seekers , and unfortunately a lot of bad press will come with that . 
  that does n't excuse trump of course . 
   what he 's doing is damaging the brand of sweden and especially malm\u00f6 . 
  when i hear foreigners talk about malm\u00f6 it 's almost always in a bad light sucks , does n't it ?
