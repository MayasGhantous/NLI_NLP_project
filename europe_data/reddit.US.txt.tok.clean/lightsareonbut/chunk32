  when do you ever hear us described in a positive light ? 
  [ the us actually has one of the highest levels of social cohesion in the world , ] ( http://www.bfna.org/media_advisory/u-s-social-cohesion-high-unaffected-by-immigration ) higher than any european country * except * the scandinavian ones despite our diversity and all our various problems . 
  nothing we do well is ever known and we 're constantly shit on . 
  i sympathize with you , but it comes with the spotlight . 
  i said i was n't a trump voter . 
  you 'll need to find someone else to argue with about that . 
  malm\u00f6 metro : 703,920 st louis metro : 2,811,588 and st. louis is literally the murder capital of the us . 
  it has issues , as anyone will admit . 
  trump has been very critical of the american crime rate . 
  he 's threatened to send in the national guard if chicago ca n't get its criminals under control . 
  but in this case , he 's talking about immigration from the middle east , and using sweden as an example of how it allegedly adds to crime . 
  it 's a perfectly valid point if true . 
  yes , and the population of malm\u00f6 is 7 % that of chicago . 
  what 's the point of comparing two such different things ? 
  and even if we suck at crime management , what difference does it make ? 
  the only comparison that matters is sweden before vs sweden now . 
  edit : not a trump voter btw . 
  east : individualist greeks west : survivalist greeks north : secular greeks south : traditional greeks, 
  you * just * learned that ? 
  things i find interesting : 1 . 
  apparently estonia really ca n't into nordic . 
  the map could also be drawn differently . 
  example : all colonial new world countries could be considered a cultural group , with former colonies ireland , malta and philippines . 
  poland , wtf ? 
  sure , i think it 's your turn to pick the target . 
  wait until every image showing something you 're bad at gets upvoted to 20k . 
  yes , but those interventions tend to be massively unpopular . 
  i would n't underestimate that . 
  recent history in ukraine and syria shows that we are n't always willing to fight for political interests . 
  also , our interests are , usually , the same as europe 's . 
  it was france who pulled us into vietnam , and also libya , for that matter , and who wanted to do joint strikes against assad in syria until obama refused . 
  likewise we 're at odds with russia over ukraine , and with china over the south china sea , in both cases taking the same position as most of europe , and fighting daesh . 
  and although it goes against german pacifism , democratic stability in afghanistan and iraq is in europe 's interest . 
  we host the un because the lesson we learned from the world wars was , `` neutrality helps the oppressor , never the victim . '', 
  the us was always a dogmatically neutral and isolationist country , the country of the neutrality acts , the only major country to stay out of the league of nations and even today we refuse to be part of the icc , unclos and other conventions . 
  nato was designed `` to keep the americans in and the russians out . '', 
  * keeping * us in is necessary because of our isolationist tendencies . 
  we do n't want an empire and will gladly go home if we 're not wanted . 
  that said , most americans have a quite favorable opinion of europe so i do n't see why our policies would n't reflect that . 
  i 'm not a trump supporter , but we 're getting nowhere so i 'll stop here . 
  some in general would disagree , but they 're very far from a majority . 
  and most americans have at least some native american ancestry , so most of their descendants would agree . 
  merged with guam , it would be over 200k . 
  or maybe guam + samoa could be added to hawaii . 
  he did n't say it * was * the soviet union . 
  he said it was `` another union , '' which of course is true . 
  and yes i understand the concept of reality , thanks , but if you 're not relying on your own judgment to determine what is real , whose judgment * are * you using ? 
  you said :  the obvious difference is that criticism of trump voiced by leaders is justified therefore , if his criticism of them is justified , there 's no difference . 
  so it comes down to your personal judgment on whether his criticism is justified or not . 
   i do n't believe in a second that a single us dollar is spent out of friendliness towards europe . 
  why not , if i may ask ? 
  we fund 25 % of the un 's annual budget . 
  why would this be hard to believe ? 
   bombing the afghans i think you mean we 're defending afghanistan , which just celebrated the first democratic transfer of power in its entire modern history . 
   the obvious difference is that criticism of trump voiced by leaders is justified that makes it a matter of opinion , meaning that if you agree with trump , what he 's said is equally justified and there 's no difference . 
  just saying . 
  nigel hawthorne 's performance in the madness of king george made me regret the revolution . 
   british people do tend to think that , overall , former british colonies are now better off for having been part of the empire , by 49-15 % . 
  ours certainly is . 
  it sounds like `` wo n't allow '' is accurate for now , then . 
  personally i think all territories should either become states or become independent . 
  whoever trump eventually nominates will have to be confirmed by the senate anyway . 
  ambassadors are n't just appointed by the president 's whim . 
  from the pdf :  democracy index 2016 highlights  * a trust deficit causes the us to become a `` flawed democracy '' *  surveys by pew , gallup and other polling agencies have confirmed that public confidence in government has slumped to historic lows in the us . 
  this has had a corrosive effect on the quality of democracy in the us , as reflected in the decline in the us score in the democracy index . 
  as for plurality of popular choice , yes of course , our party system constitutes a `` flawed democracy , '' one that has resulted in 200 years of almost uninterrupted prosperity . 
  see my rant below . 
  personal income does n't have much to do with corporate influence . 
  we 've never liked taxes ; ask george iii . 
  and if you look at the map , you 'll notice we 're very much in the middle in terms of income equality , not especially equal or unequal , unlike our friends in europe and latin america who are on opposite extremes . 
  no it does n't , it basically justifies their negativity , blaming it on deindustrialization , income inequality and all the usual suspects . 
  yeah , but this is what causes low public trust in the first place . 
  trump would n't have been elected if voters did n't have such an unrealistically negative outlook on everything . 
  but still better than france , apparently . 
  a dark day for republicanism . 
  i will be downvoted , but can i just rant briefly about how annoying it is to always be on the receiving end of these bullshit lists ? 
  really , we 're less democratic simply because we have less trust in our government ? 
  gosh , if only we had more blind faith in our leaders , that would make us more democratic . 
  according to the economist , it actually would . 
  oh and `` income inequality , '' because that 's a democracy thing . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:2014_gini_index_world_map,_income_inequality_distribution_by_country_per_world_bank.svg ) we 're not about income equality . 
  it 's just tiresome to be punished by every international organization in the world simply because we have a different political culture from northern europe . 
  [ according to the report , ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/01/daily-chart-20 ) the primary criteria by which we 're not a full democracy anymore is `` trust in government and elected officials . '', 
  if only we trusted donald trump , then we would be a full democracy again . 
  really , they 're going to stop cooperating in intelligence and counter-terrorism because trump said `` look at what happened in sweden last night '' ? 
  and close their businesses in the us ? 
  and the eu is going to take further actions ? 
  this is the `` more adult '' policy ? 
  what then ? 
  all i 'm asking is what this crisis would consist of . 
  an exchange of rude comments on twitter ? 
  yeah but devoid of context it looks like an atrocity , and is regularly presented as such . 
  this is a problem with international statistics in general , since no two countries are the same . 
  other statistics like infant mortality are just as affected by [ differences in reporting , ] ( http://www.nber.org/aginghealth/2015no1/w20525.html ) but [ you do n't mind using those . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5v4a51/life_in_sweden_versus_life_in_the_united_states/ddzbksi/ ), 
  i would assume `` median gdp per capita '' was a typo - maybe the user meant to erase the last three words and replace with `` income . '', 
  anyway , the gist is correct , and mississippi is n't an average state , it 's the poorest state . 
  and i think this is after taxes , but i could be mistaken . 
  what exactly would this `` crisis '' have consisted of ? 
   no it 's not .
