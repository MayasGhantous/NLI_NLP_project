  yes it is . 
  you 're equating hourly productivity with productivity overall . 
  and you ca n't say french workers are more efficient because they work 300 hours less , unless you know what the result would be if they worked those extra 300 hours . 
  there is a law of diminishing returns , after all . 
  you 're drawing very broad conclusions about work practices from a single statistic . 
  so if you only work an hour a day , you 're as productive as if you worked eight hours ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  define it however you want , we produce more . 
  and i doubt an extra 300 hours per year makes all the difference . 
  we produce more , so yes , we 're more productive . 
  you might be confusing productivity with something else .

   analysts assess that the union for a popular movement ( ump ) , the current ruling party , is not assured of winning the presidential election and , as a result , analysts are interested in the electoral strategy of the non-ruling parties listed below . 
  additional information on these topics will help analysts assess , and prepare key us policymakers for , the post-election french political landscape and the potential impact on us-france relations . 
  oh no , we 're trying to assess the impact on us-france relations !,

  no i did n't . 
  it was in the previous comment :  there are no operational requirements unless you 're going to say that our assistance was n't required in libya , it 's obvious that france and the uk need more carriers to meet their operational requirements . 
  really ? 
  germany requests our support even now . 
  our support means aircraft carriers . 
  it 's 2 +2 , guy . 
  now who 's strawmanning ? 
  i did n't say * the primary interest of germany , * or that germany was * responsible , * did i ? 
  i said that germany requested the support of our military , which includes our aircraft carriers , and that 's certainly true , as it 's true now . 
  schr\u00f6der was 100 % in favor of intervention , so yes , * at the request of germany * would be accurate . 
  certainly * in support of germany * is unquestionable . 
  for what ? 
  this is n't controversial . 
  france , italy and the uk also deployed carriers to kosovo . 
   tell me about all the times the us had to use their supercarries at the request of germany . 
  the yugoslav wars would be one example . 
  the uk is building two supercarriers right now . 
  they chose to go with diesel propulsion instead of nuclear , and ramps instead of catapults , to save money . 
  france has one nuclear supercarrier and still needed help in libya . 
  of course the operational need for more and better hardware exists . 
  the problem is that no one wants to pay for it . 
  well , who knows if the white house * really * expects it ? 
  is n't this also the eu 's position ?

  it 's the response of people who are suddenly finding themselves in way over their heads . 
  trump was elected because `` he 's not a politician . '', 
  in fact , he has no idea what he 's doing and neither do his neckbeard advisors , so when pressed , their response is , `` yes we do know what we 're doing !, 
  you 'll see !, 
  everyone will see ! '', 
  same goes for white house aides apparently mistaking russian disinformation for fact . 
  everyone is eager to make this ( and hostility to the media , war with the judiciary , etc. ), 
  out to be hitleresque , but really i think it 's just ignorance and panic . 
  but this is what happens with a protest vote . 
  hopefully people will start to take democracy more seriously .

   and it 's one of the less egregious national anthems ( looking at you france `` qu'un sang impur abreuve nos sillons ! '' ) . 
  for sheer bloodlust , it 's hard to beat the marseillaise . 
  he did n't say that , and again that 's not the issue . 
  the issue is the claim that he does n't have `` any right to express how things should be . '', 
  if you have to make shit up in order to justify your opinions , you 'd be better off without them . 
  he did n't say that , and that was n't the question . 
  the question was this :  why does this ** american ** thinking he has any right to express how things should be in ** our home . 
  ** the idea what we do n't have a right to express opinions about european affairs is just childish and yes , hypocritical . 
   including your president have stated it . 
  that 's an outright lie . 
   some of and so is that . 
  one man is n't `` some of , '' and even bannon says he hopes it can be avoided , and even if what you said were true , changing `` some of '' into `` the united states '' is grossly unfair . 
  on the contrary , it sounds kind of pathetic to claim that the us is pushing for a civil war in europe on the basis of one idiot 's statement , especially when the idiot himself says in the article that he hopes it can be avoided . 
  as for the rest , europe is the continent that invented the [ civilizing mission . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilizing_mission ) even now , your governments are deeply engaged in trying to make the rest of the world conform to your values . 
  bannon is apparently an earnest christian and for that reason alone he 's justified in expressing an opinion . 
   i wonder how many americans know about his views ( vs just ignorant voters ) and among them , how many actually support it ( vs voting for what they believe to be the lesser evil ) . 
  before the election , he was completely unknown ; if anyone knew of him at all , it was only as the manager ( not the creator ) of the far-right website breitbart news . 
  he 's been getting more media attention since then , and what people think is pretty much the same as what people in any western country think , which is to say that there 's at least a small minority who agree . 
  you expect something different from communism ? 
   how is that not a superpower situation ? 
  the us had by far the largest economy in the world . 
  because the definition of a superpower is n't * the country with the largest economy , * even if you 're talking only in economic terms . 
  by the way , what is the point of your account ?
