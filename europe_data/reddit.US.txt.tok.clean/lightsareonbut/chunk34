  your user name is `` mightierthanthou '' and it seems the only thing you ever post on reddit is how awesome and powerful america is compared to other countries . 
  what 's going on with that ? 
  from here : https://www.amazon.com/economics-world-war-international-macroeconomic/dp/0521785030 and your figures seem to basically agree : the us 's gdp is about 2x germany 's . 
  that 's not really a superpower situation imo . 
  i do n't think it 's the right term . 
  gdp in 1938 ( billions ) : 1 . 
  germany : 46.0 3 . 
  ussr : 23.0 i 'm not sure if the uk figure includes its overseas territory . 
  actually , columbia is the federal district ; washington is the city within the federal district . 
  so does france . 
  it 's legal at 12 weeks in france and 20 weeks in alabama . 
  and then you learn that germany has stricter restrictions on abortion than alabama . 
  this always annoys me . 
  we 're not any more right-wing or left-wing . 
  we have a different political culture . 
   if i recall , it was european powers that fought against ukraine joining nato . 
  germany and france did . 
  romania was in favor . 
   you never were the world police . 
  we 're literally the only remaining members of united nations command . 
  [ here 's an earlier engraving . 
  ] ( https://wharferj.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/6a01053620481c970b015394242adb970b-800wi.jpg ) the spiky bits sticking up from the gate at the entrance are the severed heads of traitors . 
  the way most people use the phrase , they seem to mean , at most , a coast guard . 
  i think an eu navy equivalent to ours would greatly improve our relationship . 
  it would eliminate the backseat-driver mentality in europe , and we could stop being world police . 
  eh , i think it 's overall a positive development , although an eu navy would be more useful imo . 
   these were n't built to to help defend anything , they were built to keep americans in jobs at the expense of the us taxpayer . 
  sounds good to me . 
  there are countless industries involved in the production of military hardware , and military research and development has always been a major driving force of technological innovation . 
  the internet and gps both began as military projects . 
  as i said , * every * other g7 country not only defers such taxes for their companies , [ they exempt them altogether . 
  ] ( http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-current-system-international-taxation-work ), 
  [ it was n't rigged . 
  ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/myths-cost-democrats-presidential-election-521044 ) the user said he came to that conclusion by looking at the size of crowds on tv . 
  why do you respect that ? 
  it was actually sanders voters who ( after it was mathematically impossible for sanders to win ) started clamoring for superdelegates to defy precedent and vote instead for the candidate with the fewest votes . 
  * that * would have been rigging it . 
  even if it had been rigged , are you forgetting about trump university ? 
  how donald trump literally defrauded elderly americans out of their pensions , credit cards and life savings ? 
  where 's the desire to punish an actual con artist ? 
  nothing she was falsely accused of compares with what he 's actually done . 
  and that 's leaving aside the stupidity of his views , his anti-patriotism , his rejection of american civics , his obvious narcissism , his constant lies , his refusal to release his taxes , his collusion with foreign enemies , his betrayal of old allies and the fact that he 's 70 years old and has no record of ever having served his country in any way . 
  american corporations with subsidiaries in other countries still have to pay taxes to those countries on the money they earn in their borders . 
  we allow deferrals because otherwise , they 're getting taxed twice , which makes it hard for our businesses to expand overseas . 
  all other g7 countries exempt their corporations from such taxes altogether : http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-current-system-international-taxation-work but if this is something you think will help , by all means vote for it . 
  that 's different from voting out of spite . 
  i 'm talking about our entire tax code , but this is the only part that matters :  u.s. corporations ** pay low taxes , even though ** the corporate tax rate in the u.s. is one of the highest * rates ( 35 % ) in the world . 
  what corporations care about is what they actually pay , not what the rate is on paper . 
  no , read the article . 
  there 's a difference between tax rate and effective tax rate . 
  our top marginal tax rate may be 39 % but thanks to deductions , our corporate tax rate is * effectively * around 13 % . 
  that article is badly worded and needs a cleanup but it 's saying the same thing . 
  did you read it ? 
  here 's a graph on that page : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:effective_corporate_tax_rate_oecd_countries,_2000-2005_average.jpg here 's another one : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporate_tax_in_the_united_states#/media/file:us_effective_corporate_tax_rate_1947-2011_v2.jpg, 
  no , i voted for her because i 'm a patriot . 
  and taking these points :  nobody wants to build anything here . 
  [ the united states is the world 's 2nd largest manufacturer after china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manufacturing_in_the_united_states ) and manufacturing jobs have been increasing since 2010 . 
   do you even know what business tax is in the us ? 
  [ it 's 12.6 % . 
  ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/01/news/economy/corporate-tax-rate/ )  we 're 18 trillion in the hole no , we owe 18 trillion . 
  [ we 're also owed 16 trillion by other countries . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1fxhpd/til_for_every_dollar_the_us_owes_a_foreign/ ) and most of the money we owe is to the federal reserve , i.e. 
  to our own citizens . 
  and next to our assets , it 's nothing . 
  the us federal government owns $ 200 trillion in oil resources alone . 
  the reason we have such a good credit rating is because we 're not even close to our credit limit . 
  maybe sanders did that because he 's old and he knows there are much more important things at stake than the kind of `` corruption '' you 're talking about . 
  maybe a career politician is n't the worst thing in the world ; maybe it 's better to have a career politician than someone with no experience whatsoever in government , no actual patriotism , no understanding of civics , no interest in history , no inclination toward even thinking about statecraft , and an obvious case of narcissistic personality disorder . 
  since you were ready to vote for sanders , against trump , presumably you should respect the former 's judgment more than the latter . 
  but whatever . 
  as you said , you voted out of spite . 
  and as i said , there are enough of us who vote based on policy to make sure it does n't get as bad as it could be . 
  sanders himself begged you for the sake of your country to vote for clinton and you voted for trump anyway , self-admittedly out of spite . 
  i wish i had polite words to describe what i think about people like you . 
  in a just world , you would all get what you deserve for voting based on your emotions instead of sane policy - you would live in a third-world hellhole with no clean water , no electricity , no employment , just an incompetent government made up of reality tv stars . 
  but you 'll never get that justice , because there are always enough of us to mitigate the damage you do , to save you from yourselves . 
  the us was [ less mono-cultural ] ( http://edgeofspace.net/alchemy/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/union_krauts.jpg ) in the past than it is now . 
  but yeah , still a lot more than europe . 
  india would be a much better case study for eurocrats than a mere colony like ours . 
  malloch is n't an ambassador ; he has n't even been nominated and might never get the job . 
  and he did n't exactly say that . 
  and this is about the uk parliament . 
  the uk 's foreign minister has said very similar things about the eu . 
   pretty much just the uk and israel so yes , he has been supportive of the uk . 
  so how is it logical to reply to my comment by saying `` it 's probably just very hard to build a positive relationships with trump '' ? 
  and why am i being downvoted for saying that countries who actually want to have positive relations with us probably should n't deliberately insult our elected leaders and the people who elected them ? 
  it 's the most obvious comment ever . 
  i realize this sub is an echo chamber , but do you actually think insulting us is n't going to worsen relations ? 
   well if we look at the calls with mexico and australia it seems that maintaining a good relationship with this madman is anyway an exercise in walking on egg shells . 
  is n't this thread about the uk , who want a trade deal from us ? 
  has n't trump so far been supportive of that ? 
  what 's wrong with saying that `` denouncing '' our elected leaders will probably have the effect of worsening relations ? 
   maybe seek out more rational allies in the eu , china and india . 
  china , the totalitarian dictatorship that harvests protesters for their organs ? 
  that will be pretty difficult for people who ca n't stop themselves from denouncing trump . 
   i do n't see how it 's our problem you elected a racist , sexist with a rise similar to fascism . 
  you elected him , do n't cry when we wo n't indulge your delusions that we 're ok with it . 
  i 'm not crying ? 
  this is what i said :  if any countries actually want a positive relationship with us it 's stupid to expect good relations to result from `` denouncing '' our elected leaders and the people who elected them . 
  denounce us all you want , but do n't expect anything from us .
