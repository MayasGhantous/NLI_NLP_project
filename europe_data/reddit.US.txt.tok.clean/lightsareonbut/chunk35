   saying that it has been hard so far to to build a positive relationship with the trump administration is not an insult . 
  did you watch the video ? 
  in it , the speaker called him a racist and a sexist and said that banning him was standing up for equality . 
  i 'm sure trump will consider that an insult and so will his voters . 
  and as a reminder , republican voters have traditionally been more pro-nato and pro-europe than democrats . 
   anyway , my point is that building relationships is a mutual process , and so far trump has n't made it very easy to build a positive relationship . 
  what are you referring to ? 
  he 's been very supportive of the uk so far . 
  maybe start by refraining from deliberate insults ? 
  like it or not , he was elected and at least 42 % of americans give him a positive approval rating so far ( those people do n't consider themselves to be racists , sexists or fascists , by the way ) . 
  parliament is insulting quite a large number of people along with him . 
   do n't think so , pretty sure he is not a good speaker and would have embarassed himself . 
   its probably much better for his pr to meet the queen anyway without having to give a speech . 
  if they wanted to save him from embarrassment , they should have reached an agreement behind the scenes . 
  banning him from parliament ( in the video the speaker says it 's because of `` racism , '' `` sexism , '' etc. ), 
  is a clear insult and not good pr . 
  edit : i even feel a bit insulted by it myself ( even if i do n't like trump , he is the president ) , and those who voted for him are probably outraged . 
  if any countries actually want a positive relationship with us , i hope they do n't continue with this kind of stuff . 
  college education in the us is usually accused of being * too * broad . 
   your own source contradicts you : 66 % of whites without collage degrees voted for trump . 
  but for college graduates overall , 45 % voted for trump and 49 % voted for clinton . 
  it does n't stop at marches either :  he said he started the group a year ago to `` mobilise '' scots living in the netherlands and of course he 's a marxist , meaning he 's been fattened on a diet of anti-west disinformation for years . 
  [ russia has been supporting scottish nationalists for some time . 
  ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/754332/russia-spies-scotland-independence-referendum-aid-snp-claims-security-expert ), 
  wikileaks was originally adored by the left , to give another example , both in europe and in the states . 
   in a lot of us states , the education is terrible . 
  that 's why misinformation campaigns , fake news , and `` alternative facts '' have had so much success here . 
  that 's what a lot of people on the losing side naturally think , but look at the [ education levels in exit polling ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html?_r=0 ) and you 'll notice that the actual difference in education between trump voters and clinton voters was n't very much . 
  many other factors were more predictive . 
  well-educated people fall for misinformation all the time , and as someone with moderate political views , i have to say that both the left and the right are full of it in their different ways . 
  take bernie sanders and his anti-trade , unreconstructed socialist nonsense for example . 
  why is that ? 
   he 's not , at all but clinton flat out wanted to put a no fly zone in syria which would have brought the usa into a hot war with russia . 
  clinton is n't an idiot . 
  that was probably just a starting position for negotiation . 
  it would have been part of a multilateral initiative . 
  even if we shot down a russian plane , turkey did that last year and they 're not at war with russia . 
  if you 're talking about attorney general sally yates , she was due to resign in a few days anyway ; she 's an obama appointee . 
  it appears we can function without a head . 
  sadly , that 's not new . 
  [ in 2014 ] ( http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/country-rating-poll.pdf ) only 21 % of germans said the united states was a positive influence on the world ( in 2013 it was 35 % ) , exactly the same as the number of russians . 
  our relationship with germany has never really been good . 
  i think it does . 
  i asked why my earlier comments were uncritically downvoted - that 's the reason . 
  and i may as well say it : the reaction to maddoch is the same kind of childishness . 
  ambassadors represent their governments , not their hosts . 
  look at the russian embassy in london with its constant stream of anti-uk , anti-eu and anti-nato tweets . 
  the idea of banning an ambassador because he represents his government 's views is utterly childish ; it 's just juncker , verhofstadt * et al * trying to look stronk and hyping us as an external enemy in order to scare people into supporting them . 
  give me a break . 
  i posted a video of london 1927 and today , using color footage from 1927 , and it got downvoted to 0 on this sub . 
  there is no capacity for critical thinking here where the uk is concerned . 
  i do n't know what facts of mine you think need straightening but none of that contradicts what i said . 
  even merkel said she would n't help sturgeon `` dismember '' the uk . 
  and why am i downvoted ? 
  a bit sensitive are we ? 
   partly and tbh i do n't think that was a serious concern weighed against things like national identity , though i might be wrong . 
   scotland voted to remain in the eu by a ratio of 2:1 . 
  they also voted against independence , and polls show that they do n't want another referedum . 
  if your leaders are giving support to divisive nationalists like nicola sturgeon , the only objective description of that is an attempt to dismember the uk . 
  for that matter , eu federalists openly speak of their attemps to change public opinion in sovereign countries throughout europe . 
  this is a messy business , but it seems that some want to have it both ways . 
  anyone have a link to the data ? 
  yes , in germany it 's 12 weeks and in alabama 20 weeks , with exceptions in both cases . 
  damn , i hate agreeing with scalia . 
  could i ask your opinion on whether we should adopt ranked voting ? 
  it seems maybe inevitable , and also the only realistic way to break free of our gerrymandered , hyper-polarized political gridlock , but i 've been having misgivings about it lately for the same reasons you mentioned . 
  enabling a plural party system would lead to more extreme parties , many of them with little experience in government . 
  i worry that it could lead to disunion . 
  they 're not necessarily more or less progressive , just different . 
  often the things considered `` progressive '' in the us are things that happen to be common in european countries - germany for example has a very generous welfare system - but then you learn that they also have tighter restrictions on abortion than alabama . 
  we just have a different political culture , due to our history having branched off 400 years ago . 
  none of that really means anything unless you have the same challenges and circumstances , and you do n't . 
  in all of those statistics the us would have a higher score than mexico , but we 're not more progressive than mexico . 
  `` progressive '' is more of an ideological question . 
  eh , my guess is that they 'd love to reject him , since it proves they 're stronk . 
  i doubt the senate would even confirm him , to be honest . 
  yes , i mean , we can appoint him ambassador , but then the eu can refuse to speak to him or let him sit at meetings because he 's mean , i guess . 
  it 's kind of weird , though . 
  look at the russian embassy in london and its constant stream of anti-british tweets . 
  has the eu ever rejected an ambassador on the basis of representing his government 's views ? 
   but given the us 's size of population and economy , those are the things to expect from the us this is what i meant in my first comment . 
  mexico has 140 million people , the same population and gdp as russia , and they do n't even participate in un peacekeeping , or nato , and do nothing to help the eu . 
  no asian or latin american country does anything to strengthen the eu . 
  but from us , it 's just expected . 
  meanwhile , [ ~ 80 % ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/30/vietnamese-see-u-s-as-key-ally/ ) of vietnamese have a positive opinion of america and [ 71 % ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/global-publics-back-u-s-on-fighting-isis-but-are-critical-of-post-911-torture/pg_15-06-18_asiapivotmap_web/ ) consider our military presence in asia `` a good thing . '', 
  you 're entitled to your opinion . 
  basically , though , i think that if these things cause us to lose your respect , your respect was never going to last . 
  it 's your opinion ; i 'm asking you . 
  and please do n't downvote a constructive question . 
  really , was that the objective of operation [ provide comfort , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_provide_comfort ) operation [ northern watch , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_northern_watch ) operation [ desert fox , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_iraq_ ( 1998 \\ ) ) etc. 
  [ that 's what putin wants , actually .

   her lamp is now extinguished . 
  yet another thing that made us what we were has been undermined and disregarded . 
  it is fucking tragic and makes me incredibly sad . 
  me too , but i mean , this is n't the first time we 've had an anti-immigrant administration . 
  and 17 % of our population are foreign-born ; we have nearly 20 % of the world 's immigrant population , more than any other country . 
  one orange man is n't going to change that . 
   the us happens to have much more racial diversity than finland , it 's unfair to punish the us for that when finland 's racism has n't really been tested . 
  ** thank you .
