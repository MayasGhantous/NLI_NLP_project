  we 're not fascists either . 
  we 've been a constitutional democracy our entire existence , actually . 
  what ? 
  of course he 's pro-brexit . 
  he was hoping to be the pm who led the uk out of the eu , and he 's been harping on the anglosphere as an alternative to the eu for years . 
  it 's ok , turks . 
  they 'd never want us either . 
  i do n't know about the rest of iraq but if you asked in the kurdistan region , bush would certainly get a higher approval rating than obama . 
  same in afghanistan . 
  in addition to obama 's super-high positives , johnson 's negatives were a little surprising . 
  i mean , i know he 's pro-brexit , but he 's also funny , clever , well-read and seems like a great guy . 
  well if it actually means urbanization of the surrounding area , then those voting patterns will change eventually ... 
   in `` the evolution of the murphy '' , an irish child begins life as a potato , then becomes a vagrant , a cop and finally a corrupt political official . 
  potatoes to politicians in one generation . 
  that , gentlemen , is what upward mobility looks like . 
   euro area unemployment rate : 9.8 %  us unemployment rate : 4.7 %  eu poverty rate : 16.4 %  us poverty rate : 13.5 % what is the point of posting this ? 
  ** and your account is a week old and consists entirely of anti-us and pro-russia shitposting , so you 'll forgive me if i think you 're not being sincere . 
   it is no news that the left has some severe nutters amongst them , but they are by no means the majority within the left . 
  thanks for your comment . 
  but of course you would think that ; you 're on the left . 
  speaking as someone with moderate political views who would prefer either any bush or any clinton over a bernie sanders or donald trump , to me the left seems as dangerous to us as the right , only in different ways . 
  it 's more insidious , a slow corruption of our society , death by a thousand cuts . 
  you ask how jill stein is important - she got 3 % of the popular vote in this last election . 
  and [ here she is in moscow , talking about how russia has a better record on human rights . 
  ] ( http://americablog.com/2016/08/jill-stein-moscow-criticized-us-human-rights-said-nothing-russian-human-rights.html ) meanwhile her vice presidential candidate ( a university professor ) says he 's dedicated his life to `` fighting this corrupt , degenerate , white-supremacist monstrosity called the united states . '', 
  and ok , they 're the fringe . 
  but even michelle obama said that she 'd never in her life been proud of america before her husband was elected . 
  and corbyn `` only '' wants to disarm the uk and surrender all geopolitics to russia . 
  the left is simply unpatriotic , and at its extreme it 's a natural fifth column of any enemy , and extremely dangerous imo . 
  also you really should read the article . 
  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stop-the-war-linked-to-putin-puppets-s6fdwq968 note that they 're also funding scottish nationalists . 
  and in the us , there 's [ calexit , ] ( http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/12/13/from-his-home-in-russia-calexit-leader-plots-california-secession/ ) and of course trump . 
  the point of destabilization is to divide your enemies , so it means promoting all extremes , not just one . 
  times of london : http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stop-the-war-linked-to-putin-puppets-s6fdwq968, 
   all right extremist parties in europe are directly tied to russia . 
  and left too . 
  see : stop the war coalition , jeremy corbyn , jill stein ... destabilization is about promoting all extremes . 
  was n't he probably referring to the revolution in 1989 in which thousands died ? 
  at any rate , legal restraint takes time . 
  it 's not like anyone can actually stop him from signing orders . 
  ^ the dhs secretary has assured the senate that the court order will be be obeyed , and apparently it is being obeyed at most airports . 
  the situation at others seems more of a chaotic mess . 
  of course it 's concerning , but i do n't have any doubts about how it will end . 
  and the dhs people seem more confused than anything , which is n't surprising , considering the way trump issued these orders . 
  really , the main thing i take away from all this is confirmation that he and his idiots ( bannon etc ) have no idea what they 're doing . 
  they were our ancestors . 
  it 's estimated that 10 % of americans today can trace their ancestry back to the 55 survivors of the mayflower . 
   look at what is happening tonight in america . 
  dictatorship is coming . 
  no , it 's not . 
  really , you can relax . 
  americans have had democratic government since 1620 . 
  there 's no chance of us abandoning it now . 
  we might crash the economy into the ground , but it will be done democratically . 
   after playing eu4 , civ seems ridiculously shallow and boring . 
  imo that 's also eu4 after ck2 . 
  all ways ? 
  he was more popular in western europe than he was at home , and seemed sometimes to have actual disdain for his own country . 
  michelle obama saying when he was elected , `` for the first time in my adult life , i am proud of my country , '' disqualified both of them in many people 's opinions . 
  then there was the king of jordan 's remark , `` i think i believe in american power more than obama does , '' painful because it was true . 
  it 's not perfect democracy but as they say , `` perfect '' is the enemy of `` good . '', 
  most of them were bad guys . . 
  fair enough if that 's how you see it , but i think it confuses his message . 
  he actually said that european populism is influencing us more than the reverse . 
  he said trump , not usa . 
  and he identified europe as the origin of the populism we 're currently suffering from . 
  misleading title , [ agenda pushing . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5r3ity/the_usa_isis_and_russia_are_the_main_threats_to/dd44pny/ ) and what he actually said was that [ the us has been infected with european-style populism , ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/eu-parliaments-chief-brexit-negotiator-guy-verhofstadt-on-donald-trump-immigration-ban-populism-2017-1 ) so it seems more like the eu is a threat to us . 
  yeah , and aside from trump himself they do n't really have much power in the us either . 
  if we had a system like the eu parliament where the dominant party/coalition gets to choose their president , trump would never have got close to power . 
  but verhofstadt is right that our politics in general have been getting euro-fied for years , and obama and trump are both products of that . 
   responding to a question about trump 's ban on refugees from seven majority-muslim countries , verhofstadt said that the president 's views and policies came from populists in europe . 
   `` populism by trump is more influenced by our populism than the opposite . 
  it 's the opposite of what people think -- it 's from here first and it went over to the atlantic , '' verhofstadt said . 
   http://www.businessinsider.com/eu-parliaments-chief-brexit-negotiator-guy-verhofstadt-on-donald-trump-immigration-ban-populism-2017-1, 
  well yeah , but even in the 1800s it was divided into the kingdom of bavaria , the kingdom of prussia , the kingdom of w\u00fcrttemberg , etc. 
  `` germany '' is a more recent thing . 
  i 'll argue with it . 
  germany became a single country in 1871 . 
  it existed as a constitutional monarchy for 43 years before ww1 , and then for another 15 years between the truce and the nazis coming to power . 
  the time since ww2 does n't seem like much but it 's actually most of its national history . 
  jesus christ this sub . 
  all of those countries are current allies of ours and two of them we liberated from dictatorship . 
  the rest of that sentence seems more telling :  members of trump 's inner circle have warned british officials that it would be counterproductive for charles to `` lecture '' trump on green issues during the president 's june visit to britain * and that the president will `` erupt '' if pushed , * the sunday times of london reported . 
  so on the surface it 's more like `` he 'll embarrass all of us if the subject comes up . '', 
  they 'll be down to [ drastic measures ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvahta26efq&amp;t=5m27s ) before long . 
  there is n't going to be a dictatorship . 
  when you write an article urging people to `` fight '' against `` inner and outer enemies , '' you 're a nationalist . 
  and i mean , nationalism is good , no large state functions without it , but that 's what it is . 
  i used it because that was the standard used in the comment i replied to . 
  also , i did n't notice at first , but the statistics in the first link are 10 years old . 
  mexico , like us , is n't easy to generalize . 
  there are certainly several [ states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ranked_list_of_mexican_states ) that are richer than many european [ states . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_ ( nominal \\ ) _ per_capita ), 
  mental illness is a reason . 
  u/executivemonkey likes to play a national caricature on this sub . 
  after all the comments on this sub about `` time to ally with china , '' you would n't think anyone would mind making deals with turkey . 
  and back in the early 2000s he wanted to emancipate europe from american interference . 
  verhofstadt personifies the love/hate relationship we have . 
  he lost the presidency to barroso partly because he was too anti-american at the time .
