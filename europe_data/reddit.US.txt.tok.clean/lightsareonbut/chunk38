  that 's because china actually has taken advantage of us , and is an autocratic dictatorship .

  she did n't say `` obey orders . '', 
  she said `` have the backs of our allies and make sure that our allies have our back as well . '', 
  and she 's not entirely wrong . 
  there 's no reason we should be the only rich country in korea for example . 
  and also no reason any of our allies in asia could n't be involved in europe . 
  i think she actually said that she just expects allies to be allies . 
  but `` showing our strength , '' ugh these people are embarrassing . 
  read the second half of that sentence and be amazed . 
  what ? 
  it counts . 
  asked for clarification , the prime minister explained that britain and america will still consider invading foreign countries `` for a shitload of money . '', 
  and we did intervene in iraq against genocide throughout the 1990s , in operation [ provide comfort , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_provide_comfort ) operation [ northern watch , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_northern_watch ) etc. 
  i do n't think u/acrasn meant that we literally ca n't fail to do this , but that we should n't . 
  at that time iraq was a soviet ally . 
  the us aided it briefly during the iran-iraq war on the basis of `` lesser of two evils , '' but its military was almost entirely soviet and french-equipped . 
  and the chemicals were mostly [ german .

   if someone would ask `` how would it begin '' , i would answer `` like this '' :  https://cpj.org/2017/01/journalists-charged-with-rioting-in-washington.php that 's because you 're falling for clickbait headlines and fake news . 
  when there 's a large riot and people are injured , people not directly responsible are quite often arrested along with others . 
  that 's just how it works in these situations .

  and he advocated a one-party totalitarian state , did n't he ?

  is n't fascism about a one-party , totalitarian system of government ? 
  it 's even more impressive considering [ cats ' visual acuity . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/pictures-of-how-cats-see-the-world-2013-10 ), 
  to be honest , we probably would n't have so much reactionary anti-abortion social pressure if our abortion policy was n't so liberal . 
  but it is , and i 'm not boasting about it . 
  i 'm making the point that what 's left-wing in one country is n't necessarily the same as what 's left-wing in another country . 
  that 's just not the case . 
  no women are criminalized for having abortions , and abortion clinics exist in every state . 
  664,435 abortions were performed in 2013 alone , far more per capita than in germany . 
   you have some weird ideas about abortions in germany . 
  abortions are legal within the first 12 weeks , the only thing you have to do is one ( ! ), 
  counseling session with an approved organization and you have to wait three days . 
  in alabama , it 's legal within 20 weeks ; in florida , 24 weeks ; in new jersey it 's always legal , and you also do n't have to attend any counseling and you do n't have to wait three days . 
  in germany ( this may be simplifying ; i 'm not sure how it varies between states ) legal abortion is generally more heavily restricted than in the us . 
  there 's also a waiting period and women who want them have to attend lectures first . 
  all of that is seen as far-right in american politics . 
   the right to abortion is not a subject of debate in germany . 
  it is not a sign of being left . 
  that was my point . 
  in american politics , german centrists would be considered right-wing on abortion , same-sex marriage and other issues . 
  what 's right or left-wing depends on your cultural frame of reference . 
  there 's not a single spectrum that all countries agree to . 
  edit : downvoted why ? 
  the democrats are `` left '' even by european standards on plenty of issues . 
  compare their abortion policy to germany 's , for example . 
  but what is `` left '' or `` right '' depends on your frame of reference . 
  there 's no standardized portfolio of `` left '' positions that apply on all continents . 
  [ it certainly was n't the case between obama and his secretary of state . 
  ] ( http://freebeacon.com/national-security/obama-furious-clinton-criticizing-foreign-policy/ ), 
  he literally said `` nato is very important to me . '', 
  and he also literally said it was very important to him . 
  and he made it clear that by obsolete he meant that it was old and needed to adapt . 
  and [ at least one supreme allied commander agrees with him . 
  ] ( http://news.antiwar.com/2017/01/17/key-nato-commander-agrees-with-trump-nato-is-obsolete/ ), 
  i voted for clinton . 
  you can read back through my comment history before the election if you do n't believe me . 
  i was referring to the president of the european council . 
  the president of the european commission is also nominated by the council . 
  in any case , you do n't get to vote on it . 
  the popular vote result is meaningless in our presidential elections because it would be different if the electoral college system did n't exist . 
   step number one for any would-be fascist dictator is to take control over the media ( see e.g. , putin ) . 
  the first thing trump administration did was to get into a war with any media organization that does not support them . 
  those are two very different things . 
   a very real threat to democracy ( such as it is in the us ) 9_9 i guess we could just have an `` american council , '' made up of all the governors of our member states , simply appoint their own president , like the eu does . 
   for those not following the secretary confirmations . 
  there have been a lot of times where they directly contradict what trump has been saying . 
  do they really contradict him ? 
  even in that bild interview , there was this :  mr trump 's hostility to the eu has been matched by his scepticism towards another pillar of the postwar order : nato . 
  ** but the president-elect was at pains to emphasise that he is committed to the defence of europe and the west . 
  ** his concerns are , principally , that nato had not reformed to meet the main threat that we face -- islamist terrorism -- and its members had relied too heavily on america . 
   http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/brexit-will-be-a-great-thing-you-were-so-smart-to-get-out-09gp9z357 and then the headline on reddit was * trump calls nato obsolete . 
  if you say so , but like i said , the dnvp were also anti-democratic ( and rabidly anti-semitic ) , so it does n't make his comment that much more acceptable or statesmanlike to assume he was calling the president one of them . 
  i just think you 're denying the obvious . 
  the dnvp are n't the most famous party from that era . 
  and even they were pretty fascist or at least anti-democratic . 
  i have a history degree . 
  do n't go all nationalist on me . 
  when germans hear `` 1920s radical german nationalists , '' there 's only one party they 're thinking of . 
   france and germany showed moral leadership in 2003 over the iraq war [ do n't forget putin .
