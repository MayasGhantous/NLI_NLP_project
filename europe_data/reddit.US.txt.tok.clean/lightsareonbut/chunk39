  the most famous of which is ... ? 
   radical  1920s  reactionary  nationalist i wonder who he could be referring to . 
   he added that all that was missing from trump 's speech was comparing parliament to a `` quasselbude '' or `` talking shop , '' a term used by hitler before he took power to discredit the parliamentary democracy of the weimar republic in the 1920s . 
  to be honest , [ your vice chancellor is calling our president a fascist . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5p8hi3/germany_must_prepare_for_rough_ride_under_trump/ ) trump at least says he has great respect for merkel . 
  you do n't really believe [ these answers , ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/11/2011-values0010.png ) do you ? 
  the french are n't that humble . 
  are you telling me most western europeans believe european culture to be inferior to american culture ? 
  chinese ? 
  latin american ? 
  north african ? 
  imo , the more likely explanation is [ social desirability bias . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_desirability_bias ) and the responses on isolationism and globalization are driven by current situation and perception . 
  as the article notes :  the belief that economic engagement is a good thing is especially common in the netherlands , sweden , germany and the uk -- the only four nations surveyed where less than half of the public considers global economic instability a major threat . 
  this one also does n't exist in statistics . 
  [ americans are more likely than any other nation ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/06/russia-ukraine-report-27.png ) to say their country should aid allies if attacked , for example . 
  unsurprisingly , canada and the uk are also the closest to it , with identical `` should not '' percentages and slightly higher `` do n't know . '', 
  i think what we have is more of an uncanny divide , where we 're so similar that all we notice are differences . 
  yeah but it 's ironic self-loathing , is n't it ? 
  on a recent ( bbc world service ) [ poll , ] ( http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/country-rating-poll.pdf ) britons were asked whether various countries ' influence on the world was positive or negative . 
  71 % said the united kingdom was a positive influence on the world ; 66 % of americans said the same thing about the united states . 
   i think we have more cultural similarities with somewhere like the netherlands than the us . 
  [ given your opinion of british culture  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5p5bfz/the_worst_countries_for_drinking_during_pregnancy/dcpe41f/ )  the uk is just a bit shit , and british people are quite awful . 
  there is nothing worse than bumping into another brit abroad - they are almost always cunts . 
  does n't that mean you hate them and would prefer to be with us ? 
   the german cities that had been free cities with elected assemblies for 800 years ... when most germans did n't live in them . 
  but this is n't a contest . 
  the point is that having once had a fascist government does n't automatically make you a higher authority on the subject of civics . 
  and contrary to your vice chancellor 's fearmongering , there are n't any totalitarian parties or movements of significant size in america . 
  i voted for clinton . 
  after 400 years of democratic government , we 're not exactly strangers to civics ourselves . 
   `` i think we have to prepare for a rough ride , '' gabriel said in an interview with the public broadcaster zdf , in the first official german reaction to trump 's inauguration . 
  ** he added that trump 's election was the result of `` a bad radicalisation '' . 
  **  ...  he added that all that was missing from trump 's speech was comparing parliament to a `` quasselbude '' or `` talking shop , '' ** a term used by hitler before he took power to discredit the parliamentary democracy of the weimar republic ** in the 1920s . 
  to be honest , insulting our electorate and calling our president a fascist is worse than anything trump has said . 
  if this were a paradox game , it 'd grant us a casus belli . 
   california has a secession movement ~ ~ though ~ ~ because its leader is living in russia fixed . 
  and r/calexit has 1800 subscribers . 
  yeah , a lot of actual interest there . 
  it 's actually a lot older than that . 
  the phrase [ `` city on a hill '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/city_upon_a_hill#.22a_model_of_christian_charity.22 ) was used by the founders of massachusetts bay colony in 1630 . 
  yeah , i was agreeing with you . 
  their outlook is part of our political culture . 
  it 's estimated that 10 % of americans today can trace their ancestry back to the 55 survivors of the mayflower . 
  [ is it really ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_religion#president_as_leader_of_civil_religion ), 
  fake news until better evidence is provided . 
   if you take a look at us history , christianity was always a very important factor . 
  the first settlers were puritans , the most religious english protestants . 
  fanatics . 
  not only that , but their specific doctrine was that ( as a spiritual covenant ) democracy reflected the will of god . 
  that was 400 years ago btw . 
  he 's also a natural-born citizen . 
  you guys really missed out . 
  he could have been the first guy to be both pm of the united kingdom and american president . 
  ca n't we return him and ask for a new one ? 
  you guys need your own president . 
   idk about us , but here in ukraine we can still see people that point at camera . 
  it 's not that it 's unusual . 
  his reaction was just so warm and ebullient and stood out from those around him . 
  it seemed a glimpse into his personality . 
  ^ and ^ he 's ^ cute, 
  easy cheese . 
  i do n't see the issue either . 
  it just sounded like his usual statesmanlike humor . 
  that guy pointing at the camera at 0:14 . 
  i know , but it 's possible to be self-hating about your own culture . 
  also , he 's saying that they need to get over the end of their exceptionalism , but :  for the english , the united kingdom occupies the psychic space once filled by the empire : it is the last guarantor of their characterlessness , it is the phantom which in the english mind substitutes for the england which the english will not acknowledge is their only home . 
  they will not acknowledge it lest they become just another nation like everybody else , with a specific , limited identity , a specific history , neither specially honourable nor specially dishonourable , with limited weight , limited resources , and limited importance in the world now that their empire is no more . 
  imo , that is exceptionalism . 
   the problem with the english  english psychosis  narcissistic outcome of a specifically english crisis  like other psychotics , have no sense of equality with others  the emotion central to the leave campaign was the fear of what is alien  the stranger and enemy  the english , but not the irish or scots , felt so urgent a need to express it that they threw reason and practicality to the winds i wonder if he likes the english . 
  and everyone else in our hemisphere . 
  is anyone else a little surprised at how fun this is ? 
  eh , i think the public will back him on this . 
  91 % of americans have a positive opinion of the uk , which is more than the number of americans who have a positive opinion of america . 
  i 'm curious about that one too . 
  maybe the perception is just wrong ? 
  90 % of your comment history is on r/shitamericanssay . 
  obsessed much ? 
  and it 's not about freedom of speech : what they said was a lie and i showed that it was a lie . 
  apparently that 's too much for some people to handle . 
  [ god bless . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita_in_2015.svg ), 
  because i corrected someone 's false information ? 
  explain this comment . 
  [ and here 's what it looks like just by equality , without human development . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality#/media/file%3a2014_gini_index_world_map%2c_income_inequality_distribution_by_country_per_world_bank.svg ), 
   i do n't like what you 're saying . 
  so i shall call you a communist or maybe [ they 're actually communists ? 
  ] ( http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/05/13/i-am-a-communist/ ) [ counterpunch 's logo ] ( http://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/dropzone/2015/06/cp5.png ) is from a [ soviet propaganda poster ] ( https://rosswolfe.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/aleksandr-rodchenko-poster-for-books-with-lilia-brik-1924.jpg ) for fuck 's sake . 
  during the 1990s there was war and genocide in europe we had to help stop , and since iraq we 've been busy . 
  as you just quoted , cnn said `` foreign firms , '' not `` american firms . '', 
  the claim that iraqi oil is `` utterly dominated by american and british firms '' is a lie . 
  and it comes from a trashy [ pol pot-worshipping ] ( http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/09/18/pol-pot-revisited/ ) communist website . 
   yeah it does indeed , i think that may be because of your presence here . 
  unlike you , i post regularly on this sub . 
   counterpunch is not even in the same political ballpark as `` communist '' weird , because [ they totally think they are . 
  ] ( http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/05/13/i-am-a-communist/ ) ffs , their [ logo ] ( http://uziiw38pmyg1ai60732c4011.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/dropzone/2015/06/cp5.png ) is from a [ famous soviet propaganda poster .
