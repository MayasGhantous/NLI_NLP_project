  do people actually read this and not know what it is ? 
   also , judging the us companies performance in post-war iraq does not really tell you anything about us intents it tells you that the claim that iraqi oil is * `` utterly dominated by american and british firms , '' * is a lie . 
   before the 2003 invasion , iraq 's domestic oil industry was fully nationalised and closed to western oil companies . 
  ** a decade of war later , it is largely privatised and utterly dominated by american and british firms . 
  ** [ this is a straight-up lie .

  ] ( http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/06/20/the-battle-for-iraqs-oil-wealth/ ) am i the only one getting worried ? 
  r/europe seems stupider than usual today . 
  well the examples i gave were for humanitarian reasons , but as a more general explanation we like it when things go boom . 
  no , that 's the thing about us , we do n't just defend ourselves . 
  nations that only defend themselves are kinda worthless to anyone else . 
  this thread is a fucking gold mine . 
  we 've kept 30,000 troops in south korea for the last 64 years . 
  we 've stopped taiwan from being invaded more than once . 
  we were in a nuclear cold war . 
  of course it 's a deterrent . 
  and a look at the map makes it kinda obvious why we need a large navy and air force : all our cities are on our coasts . 
  why were we in iraq throughout the previous decade ? 
  operation provide comfort ? 
  northern watch ? 
  answer that , and i think you 'll have your answer . 
  holy balls , these comments . 
  the us imports very little oil from the middle east and almost none from iraq , * unlike * the eu . 
  this sub is as bad as the_donald sometimes . 
  unfortunately only 13 countries were polled . 
  i 'm mostly posting this because i find it noteworthy that americans gave both the uk and canada a higher approval rating than they gave the united states . 
  i mean even people like stalin and hitler are patriotic . 
  it 's just human nature that everyone believes himself right , so even the worst politicians , as long as they 're not truly sociopathic , will believe that what they 're doing is ( generally ) in the interest of the people , or at least better than their opponents . 
  i think it 's basically true that most people involved in politics are patriots , but as humans they 're also weak . 
  interesting that it and the american one seem almost the same . 
  disturbingly accurate , according to the author at least : https://books.google.com/books?id=2_loefevbwqc&amp;pg=pa23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false, 
  it 's not real . 
  people who are n't proud of this sort of thing do n't upvote to 7000 a map of their countries ' colonial conquests . 
  infant mortality is another bad example , though . 
  in the us we count miscarriages , stillbirths and mortality of premature births as infant mortality and other countries mostly do n't . 
  if everyone used the same standards and had the same distribution of births by gestational age , our infant mortality rate would be lower than sweden 's .

  really , you 're not proud of trafalgar ? 
  you 're not proud of the skill and bravery of generations british soldiers , sailors and statesmen ? 
  why not ? 
  except that al-qaeda is n't a nation and their actions ca n't be seen as any epic national undertaking . 
  they 're criminals . 
  and killing civilians is all they do . 
  virtue signalling aside , of course it 's something to be proud of . 
  conquering most of the world is an achievement by anyone 's standards , and it would n't be possible without some actual virtue . 
  think of all the blood , sacrifice , devotion and brilliance that went into creating the british empire and defending it from its enemies , for example . 
  you would n't be proud of that ?

  many \u2260 most . 
  many unarmed units are logistics and medical units .

   we ( the united nations ) are still at war with best korea so we only need to break the cease fire .

  if they were neonazis , they would n't believe `` big government '' was the enemy . 
  those are the guys who were afraid obama was going to declare martial law and abolish free speech a few years ago . 
  they 're just conspiratorial rightists . 
  you said :  if you were to deny the holocaust on a website in the united states you would still face charges for that in a german court i guess i interpreted that to mean you would actually be in a german court .

   you could just search by yourself you could also source yourself .

  germany tried to extradite t\u00f6ben from the uk and [ failed . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerald_fredrick_t%c3%b6ben ) the idea that german law applies to everyone in all countries and their web content is just crazy .

  ugh , this narrative . 
  even trump has n't gone full geert wilders and declared islam incompatible with democracy . 
  europe is not getting its craziness from us . 
  that should n't stop us . 
   generally many leftists in the west think that the ukrainian conflict is like the iraq war the fault of western intervention because media from russia is trying to present it as another western intervention and in iraq 's case , they 've sold the same story for [ 13 years .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_united_states_incarceration_rate_with_other_countries as for the rest : china did n't have a legal system until the 1980s . 
  no one claims to be perfect . 
  to claim that we 're less democratic than china is absurd . 
  and in prison sentences per capita , several european countries are higher . 
  the us incarceration rate is higher because of comparatively longer sentences , and it peaked in 2008 and is declining . 
  and incarceration rate has nothing to do with political freedom or democracy . 
  that sounds like commie talk . 
  and begins with test footage of peaceful ` murican atomic cannon . 
  exactly . 
  it 's not the end of history , just a very boring part of it . 
  nuclear weapons really took the fun out of international politics . 
   where do you see that in your [ link ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy ) * european union : 75.7 * * united states : 75.92 *  unaffordable healthcare makes the quality of your healthcare irrelevant for dozens of millions of americans ... and relevant for hundreds of millions more . 
  my dad recently had surgery for colorectoral cancer . 
  if he lived in the eu , his chance of survival would have been lower . 
  i find that relevant . 
  besides , you 're changing the subject : you asked about quality . 
  now you 're saying that quality is irrelevant .
