  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=%22infant+mortality%22+us+counts+miscarriage&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8 ), 
   based on what ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_quality_of_healthcare i do n't know if i 'd say `` superb '' but it 's basically true that the problem with our health system is cost , not quality . 
   just take a look at the infant mortality rate and life expectancy to compare the two . 
  for males , the us has a higher [ life expectancy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy ) than the eu . 
  and the infant mortality statistic that is constantly used to make our health system look like shit [ is false  ( https://pjmedia.com/blog/the-doctor-is-in-infant-mortality-comparisons-a-statistical-miscarriage/ ) unlike most countries , the us counts stillbirths , miscarriages and deaths following premature births as infant mortality . 
  when standards are applied equally , our infant mortality rate is the same as norway 's . 
  ... and the homeless rate [ continues to decline , ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/01/homeless-homelessness-housing/2730301/ ) in contrast to most countries . 
  this is a test program . 
  the us [ tested ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basic_income_pilots ) basic income several times in the 1960s and '70s . 
  to be honest i had to skip over the jew-hating and autobiographical parts , but it does have chapters devoted to the art of propaganda and i did find them to be genuinely insightful . 
  everyone should read it . 
  the chapters on propaganda were quite brilliant . 
   the magnitude of a lie always contains a certain factor of credibility , since the great masses of the people in the very bottom of their hearts tend to be corrupted rather than consciously and purposely evil , and that , therefore , in view of the primitive simplicity of their minds they more easily fall a victim to a big lie than to a little one , since they themselves lie in little things , but would be ashamed of lies that were too big . 
  such a falsehood will never enter their heads and they will not be able to believe in the possibility of such monstrous effrontery and infamous misrepresentation in others ; yes , even when enlightened on the subject , they will long doubt and waver , and continue to accept at least one of these causes as true . 
  therefore , something of even the most insolent lie will always remain and stick-a fact which all the great lie-virtuosi and lying-clubs in this world know only too well and also make the most treacherous use of . 
   germans  orderly as other examples of large non-european countries we have : india , mexico , brazil , philippines , indonesia , russia ... 
  although i normally agree with you , i sometimes wonder if we 're being naive about this . 
  a more fragmented body politic is n't necessarily better in every way . 
  drawn by a polish user . 
  written by a german . 
  it 's also self-flattering . 
  `` always try to use meinie powers only for ze good , '' `` i live in peace , progress and prosperity , '' etc. 
  germany 's a little different in that the self-congratulatory version of their modern history is a quasi-catholic story of sin , confession , atonement and salvation , but thinking about how other countries ' would read is certainly pretty cringey . 
  it was an astronomy joke , actually . 
  i was explaining redshifting . 
  ireland is moving toward the viewer ; therefore its light is compressed into a shorter wavelength . 
  whereas ukraine , bulgaria and parts of russia are moving further away . 
  i guess it explains my neurotic neighbor 's frantic screams last night to know that r'lyeh was briefly surfacing between scotland and norway . 
  i could say it 's because both presidential candidates this year were the [ least popular ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/08/31/poll-clinton-trump-most-unfavorable-candidates-ever/89644296/ ) since polling began , and also that a lot of people do n't bother voting if they already know their state will go heavily to one side or the other . 
  but that would ignore the fact that it 's not just a presidential election ; you also have to elect your state governments and federal representatives . 
  the truth is that voter apathy has been increasing for years due to our binary party system . 
  a significant number of people do n't feel like they have a party that represents them . 
  but i think this is going to change over the next few years . 
  i think they 're indicative of a political culture . 
   even the us is n't immune to mccarthy-style political witch-hunts . 
  that was a congressional committee . 
  unchecked authority just does n't work on our continent . 
  even the south american dictatorships were committees ( * juntas * ) . 
  no , see , this is it : he said making guns illegal wo n't solve anything , and you replied , `` but you do n't seem to be making guns illegal . '', 
  no one wants to hear it , but the issue with ( western ) europeans is that they tend to see their continent as the model for everyone else to follow . 
  so there 's no need to understand ; only to instruct . 
  singapore 's ambassador [ complained ] ( http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/does-europes-arrogance-blind-it-to-asia/?_r=0 ) about this a few years ago . 
   however , if you ask them if they support an unchecked authority figure [ ... ] who can transcend constitutional/legal boundaries [ ... ] they 'd readily sign up . 
  almost no one in the us wants the president to have unchecked authority . 
  our entire political culture is against that . 
   ~ 50 % voted for him . 
  26 % of the electorate voted for him . 
  28 % voted for clinton . 
  and 42 % did n't vote . 
  the good thing about this is that at least that 42 % are going to learn a valuable lesson .

  i would have answered yes to the question . 
  of course fascist views are `` on the rise , '' and of course western democracies are going to remain democracies regardless . 
  i find their lack of faith disturbing . 
   so , as native americans have the same fenotype , they have one single culture , or course . 
  do n't try to turn this around . 
  * you 're * saying that diversity has nothing to do with race . 
  * you 're * saying that native americans have no culture , that black americans have no culture , that hispanic americans have no culture . 
  you 're denying others ' culture in order to justify your belief in your own enlightenment and cultural superiority . 
  how progressive of you . 
   that 's the same analogy you used . 
  ... but not the same meaning . 
  and you know that . 
  you ca n't sincerely believe that i think all crime everywhere is caused by diversity and nothing else . 
  [ in the future , this will help . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principle_of_charity ), 
   diversity has nothing to do with skin colour so your reply is a full-throated denial of the existence of native american , african american and hispanic american culture . 
  i see . 
  top virtue signalling . 
  and i 'm sure i have more in common with canadians of any color than with catalans . 
  do you have anything meaningful to add ? 
   `` less diversity = less crime is a rule that applies to all societies everywhere . '', 
  i used the same wording as you , all societies everywhere . 
  that 's what you said . 
  ... except that you added something else that changed it completely :  everybody who has cancer has it from smoking . 
  and :  one data point is not a correlation dumbass . 
  it 's your data point , dumbass . 
  you introduced london to this conversation . 
  i just pointed out that it 's red . 
  and now you 're calling me names . 
  so yeah , end of this . 
  yes , broadly speaking , europeans are more similar to each other than to non-europeans . 
  i have to tell this to r/europe ? 
  yes and i did n't reply to it because it 's just another nonsensical answer . 
  they say toronto is diverse and then that ontario has a lower crime rate than manitoba . 
  do you not see what 's wrong with that ? 
  ontario is n't toronto . 
  ontario is [ 71.7 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_ontario ) white and manitoba is [ 74.9 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_manitoba ) white , alberta [ 75 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_alberta ) , etc. 
  there is n't actually a significant difference in diversity between the provinces . 
  all four provinces and toronto have higher crime rates than more homogeneous [ quebec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_quebec ) ( 87 % white ) , [ newfoundland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_newfoundland_and_labrador ) ( 94 % white ) , etc. 
  for the record , the us is 63 % white , chicago 45 % , los angeles 29 % ... and you did n't answer my question :  c ) what has the ethnic history of other continents been like in that 400 years ? 
  i guess you know the answer . 
  why are you all so determined to believe that ethnic diversity does n't contribute to social problems ? 
  careful , they 've got musical instruments !, 
   you : everybody who has cancer has it from smoking . 
  this is true for all cancer patients everywhere . 
  are you telling me that your honest interpretation of what i said is that * every * crime rate in the world is caused by diversity , and that there are * no other causes of crime ? 
  * assuming that i 'm not utterly deranged , you 're probably mischaracterizing my statement , are n't you ?
