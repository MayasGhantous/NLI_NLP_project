  you ca n't blame me for saying `` straw man '' when you 're doing that . 
   your map confirms exactly what i said , that there is n't a correlation between diversity and crime in the uk , so i do n't know why you linked it . 
  possibly because london appears as a splatter of red on an otherwise ochre england ? 
  me : smoking positively correlates with cancer . 
  you : bullshit . 
  i know a guy who has cancer and has never smoked . 
  and [ this other guy ] ( https://i0.wp.com/news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/67212000/gif/_67212717_uk_peace_624map.gif ) smokes and is totally fine . 
  a ) and ethnic diversity . 
  b ) i said na , not usa . 
  c ) what has the ethnic history of other continents been like in that 400 years ? 
  because it 's true . 
  400 years of north american history demonstrate that ethnic diversity positively correlates with a broad range of social problems , including crime . 
  that does n't mean we 're opposed to it , because as individualists we recognize that individual liberty and legal equality are vastly more important than social harmony , but it is what it is . 
  straw man . 
  i said `` less diversity = less crime , '' not that high crime is impossible without diversity . 
   london , which is more diverse than anywhere in america [ citation needed ], 
   you were implying , that the tensions caused by diversity cause crime . 
  i 'm not implying . 
  as a rule , homogeneity = less crime . 
  that 's true the world over . 
  and i 'm sorry but poles and ukrainians really are n't such an extreme example . 
  we have plenty of polish and some ukrainian immigrants and neither group gets into much trouble in our hemisphere either . 
  and one ( 1 ) minority group = diversity ? 
  and all minorities are the same ? 
  and 60k ? 
   my hometown of 60k consists of 60 % poles , 40 % ukrainians . 
  so , 100 % white then ? 
  i think you 're suffering under a misconception . 
  i 'm not a trump voter . 
  diversity is good , but it tends to mess up a lot of statistics . 
   i 'm not sure how to call a society that worships unbridled capitalism and sees greed as almost a virtue and most of public programs as communism . 
  call it whatever you want . 
  you 're entitled to your opinion . 
  it 's just believing our nearly identical twin to be the opposite that baffles me . 
  but they do n't enjoy the same conditions . 
  the black and hispanic drop-out rate in toronto schools is [ 40 % ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/solving-the-dropout-mystery-of-torontos-spanish-speaking-students/article561422/ ) . 
  the incarceration rate for aboriginal canadians is higher than for black americans . 
  they have the same issues . 
  it 's just that no one outside north america ever hears about them . 
   yes , provinces . 
  but canada as a whole has around 1.4 murder rate per 100k compared to the us 3.9 murder rate , and from that , you infer that we have a more predatory culture ? 
  you 're making a ridiculous generalization . 
  the us states that border canada have the same homicide rates and in some cases lower rates than the canadian provinces next door . 
  the nationwide difference of 1.4 compared to 3.9 is mostly due to a handful of bad states with severe problems and it 's peanuts - those are very small numbers in either case compared to mexican states where the number reaches 40 or ** 60 . 
  ** and the reason canada 's statistics tend to be better is because only 2 % of canadians are black , and 1 % are hispanic . 
  in some of our states , 40 % are hispanic . 
  less diversity = less crime is a rule that applies to all societies everywhere . 
  americans and canadians are so alike that none of you can even tell us apart most of the time yet you all cling to this beliefs that there is some intangible difference between us . 
  it does n't exist . 
  [ about that ... ] ( http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/charts_mac04-gilmore.jpeg ), 
   considering canada and switzerland are both well armed and have a low homicide rate i 'd say it 's the social policies that make the difference . 
  the us has a `` predatory '' society where it 's really easy to find yourself in a horrible position . 
  really ? 
  canada has provinces with homicide rates several times the us 's . 
   the half of the country that voted for him is the problem . 
  on the contrary , this is the problem . 
  demonizing half the country is not the way to rebuild a civil body politic . 
  yes to the first part , not so sure about the second . 
  it 's actually prince edward island . 
  in 2012 it literally had a 0.00 homicide rate . 
  quebec is usually in the next color category , but not this year . 
  [ @ 21:27 , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgqhssvrkgy&amp;t=21m27s ) it 's important to know that in czechia , all parties are xenophobic and against gypsies and everyone agrees on that . 
  ... and in gross production , is [ 20x higher ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/energy/oil/production/per-capita ) per capita . 
   coming from a yank that 's beyond hilarious . 
  norway exports [ 38x as much oil as the united states , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_oil_exports ) with 1/62 our population . 
   they 're not responsible for what happens to their oil once it 's sold . 
  we say the same thing about our missiles . 
  well , i admit that i was using `` oil '' as a shorthand for fossil fuels . 
  norway is also the world 's [ third largest natural gas exporter ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?t=10&amp;v=138 ) ( twice as much as us , not in per capita terms but absolute terms ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://taxfoundation.org/blog/norway-s-addiction-taxes-oil ) article says you get 32 % of government revenues from petroleum activities . 
  i may have been off somewhat , but either way it 's a lot . 
  what you linked is just oil exports , not including the oil fund , which is now a [ larger ] ( https://eiti.org/news/norway-revenue-from-oil-fund-now-exceeds-revenue-from-oil ) share of government revenue . 
  your oil fund is now 1.3 % of the value of the world 's listed companies . 
  eh , these maps are misleading . 
  norway gets 50 % of its government revenue from oil exports and its oil fund , but it 's green on the map because the oil is burned elsewhere . 
  it 's like praising drug dealers for not being drug addicts . 
  and in china , marxism is far right . 
  but the only definition of far right that is relevant to this conversation is the definition of far right in germany . 
  but the top-voted comments on this thread are people calling them cavemen . 
  well , the show is [ * are you smarter than a 5th grader ? 
  * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/are_you_smarter_than_a_5th_grader%3f_ ( u.s. _ game_show \\ ) ) the fact that children can answer these questions is the point .

  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brexit-uk-reputation-eu-commonwealth_uk_58517127e4b00f3fd28c541f ), 
   i 'd still equally love other europeans if the eu stopped existing . 
  british-eu relations suggest otherwise . 
  and ? 
  why should that make anyone feel better ? 
  you 're just adding more dishonor . 
  you asked why they do n't help . 
  i 'm sorry to disillusion you , but [ western europe would n't defend eastern europe ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/nato-publics-blame-russia-for-ukrainian-crisis-but-reluctant-to-provide-military-aid/ ) if the [ polls ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/06/russia-ukraine-report-46.png ) are accurate . 
   they do n't fit in to their host country so they romanticize their ancestral lands . 
  or they look for explanations for why they do n't fit in : they do n't fit in because racist crusader europe hates islam and brown people and will never accept them . 
  their identity crisis leads them to become terrorists . 
  they took over western iraq 5 years after obama became president , and it 's now 2 years since then . 
  blame the previous administration as much as you wish . 
  i blame those who are actually responsible . 
  that includes us , the voters , who elected our current peaceniks .
