  thanks , obama . 
  and snowmen and reindeer , presumably . 
  the ferryman sounds nice . 
  i mean in the rest of their range . 
  plus , we 'd finally get to see which religion wins . 
  everyone has an opinion , and the less informed they are , the more certain they tend to be . 
  i do n't think police issues are related to domestic spying , no . 
  60 years ago , police were using attack dogs on protesters . 
  that 's an old issue . 
  domestic spying is tolerated because communication is changing and no one has a better idea . 
  this year has certainly been a challenge to my patriotism . 
  we do , actually , and have for 400 years . 
  i remember when 9/11 happened and there actually * were * armored vehicles all over the place , and i thought it unnecessary , but it did n't make me feel any less free . 
  because their presence was n't the result of a military coup that had replaced the government . 
  they were just there in case they were needed . 
  no , it 's just annoyance :  i know it might seem irresponsible to some , especially americans ... but the germans have an amazing attitude for freedom of life and they actually practice that freedom . 
  if you switched the words `` americans '' and `` germans , '' that would probably be posted to r/shitamericanssay . 
  most terrorists * are * foreign fighters . 
  they 're not people who want revenge for family members who were killed in drone strikes . 
  in fact , a country 's gdp and human development * positively * correlate with its export of terrorists . 
  and maybe they decide that the less ideal target is n't actually worth it , so there 's no attack at all . 
  or they simply ca n't arrange new plans on short notice , so it 's postponed and your authorities have more time to arrest them . 
  either way , putting up a few bollards does n't really have any impact on how free or democratic your society is . 
  still it 's madness . 
  russia illegally gives the separatists everything they need , and obama refuses to do anything for the legitimate government out of fear of `` escalation . '', 
  sheer cowardice and vanity . 
  congress overrode his veto on some measures but not enough . 
  can anyone explain why they have n't started breeding with wolves yet ? 
  then i 'm back to saying what i said in the beginning : we are n't responsible for our enemies ' beliefs . 
  it 's not war that creates terrorists . 
  [ finland , ireland , belgium and france all provide more recruits for is ( per capita of muslim population ) than lebanon or jordan . 
  ] ( http://www.citylab.com/politics/2016/08/foreign-fighters-isis/493622/ ), 
  yes , i understand that , but what i 'm saying is that they did n't . 
  read some of the [ modern history of syria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_history_of_syria ) if you want to be depressed . 
  the middle east was never at peace . 
  and wahhabist and twelver shia extremism are cultural exports of relatively peaceful and prosperous muslim countries , the ksa and iran . 
  they 're going to fight us anyway , though . 
  even china is fighting islamic terrorism in xinjiang . 
  the problem is with the middle east , and until it changes i do n't think there 's any other option . 
   the only thing that kept it stable where 7 years of constant fighting against terrorist groups careful , you 're close to admitting the need to actually fight terrorism . 
   releasing an crazy animal you created from its shackles does not change the fact that you are still responsible for creating it . 
  we are not responsible for the crazy beliefs of our enemies . 
  it would seem desperate if it was n't actually a common thing to attribute all middle eastern / islamist bullshit to the us and particularly republicans . 
  nevermind the fact that it was obama ( europe 's favorite us president ) who allowed is to take over . 
  ww2 taught everyone something , but not everyone the same thing . 
  i would follow that moustache into hell . 
  maybe because innocent angels ca n't be president . 
  are you kidding ? 
  we just elected one . 
  google `` active measures . '', 
  russia has been subverting the us for 70 years . 
  it 's a specialty . 
  [ here 's a uk example . 
  ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/stop-the-war-linked-to-putin-puppets-s6fdwq968 ), 
  is putin secretly an anglosphere bro ? 
  the national interest . 
   fucking seriously ppl ? 
  they did n't lie about hillary , they just released what she said and did . 
  [ they actually did lie . 
  ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-sidney-blumenthal-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-benghazi-sputnik-508635 ) and i mean , aside from hacking , there is sputnik and rt , constant disinformation , and support for destabilizing elements everywhere . 
  it 's the full [ program cost ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_martin_f-35_lightning_ii ) over its 50-year lifetime , yeah , but i mean , that 's what it 's expected to cost , and it 's overbudget . 
  as noted in that article , the rand corporation has concluded that the three variants had drifted so far apart during development that it would have been cheaper to design three separate aircraft . 
  i mean it 's true , the program cost is at $ 1.5 ** trillion . 
  ** but he did n't even say he wanted to cancel it , and he could n't if he did . 
  it 's kind of pathetic watching media react like this to a tweet . 
  it was n't just technology and immunity . 
  native americans were ( and are ) genetically vulnerable to epidemic . 
  the current consensus is that 95 % of the population of the new world died before colonization even began . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_removal_act yes , but that was 220 years after the founding of the colonies , and natives and whites had been intermarrying from the very beginning . 
  most natives had been fully assimilated by then . 
  edit : and even the conflicts of that period tended to be more complicated than whites against natives . 
  see : [ king philip 's war . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_philip's_war ), 
   german liberal nationalists won your civil war . 
  [ source  ( http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2015/06/30/the-civil-war-was-won-by-immigrant-soldiers/chronicles/who-we-were/ )  the u.s. minister to berlin finally posted a sign on the door : * `` this is the legation of the united states , and not a recruiting office . '' * also some starving irishmen were involved . 
  seems this myth never dies . 
  sweden has n't got rid of its waste by recycling it , but by incineration . 
  [ 50 % of sweden 's household waste is burned for electricity . 
  ] ( http://www.treehugger.com/energy-policy/no-sweden-does-not-recycle-99-percent-its-waste.html ) that 's why it imports the stuff . 
  for fuel . 
  and while fire is indeed a revolutionary technology , it 's not unknown in britain . 
  if your close friends are people you 've known since you were 5 , that would actually seem to reinforce the point . 
  you do n't make friends like that every day . 
  no but that 's another `` american '' thing . 
  we tend to have more friends , but fewer close friends . 
  the analogy is often of [ peaches vs coconuts . 
  ] ( https://theaggie.org/2015/03/16/the-paradox-of-american-friendliness/ ), 
  the author is from boston . 
  i 'm not arguing with you . 
  your attitude evolved for a reason as well . 
  well like he said in the article , to him it 's more of an expression . 
  geographic mobility is also the reason for most other `` american '' behaviors , like talking to strangers , quick but shallow friendships , etc. 
  all of which are really colonial traits , which canadians , brazilians and everyone else with similar history also have . 
  social mores evolve for a reason . 
  we say things like `` keep in touch '' because geographic mobility has been a greater part of our experience ; we still relocate more often and over greater geographical distances than most nations , and of course in past centuries for colonists and immigrants the distances were even greater . 
  i do n't know about that , but in 1940 britain still had the largest and most powerful navy in the world . 
   what was it rousseau said ? 
  `` to be sane in a world of madmen is in itself a kind of madness . '' what a burden it must be . 
  not for many years to come . 
  actually , after the war america went even deeper into isolationism than before .
