  edit : downvoted ? 
  the subject is american history . 
  allow me to believe that i might know * something * about it that you do n't . 
  you 're citing :  the untold history of the united states by oliver stone , who is not a historian and whose reputation among historians is on the same level as * ancient aliens . 
  * and smedley butler , one of the most discredited figures in american political history . 
  if you really want to understand american militarism , put down the conspiracy theories and look at our actual history . 
  we had the war of independence which created the united states , the civil war which preserved it and freed millions from slavery , wars against imperialism , world wars against totalitarianism and fascism , a cold war against communism , etc. , and all of it in line with the [ original ideas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empire_of_liberty ) we 've had for hundreds of years . 
  we do n't need conspiracies to be militaristic . 
  some nations are just like that . 
  no he did n't . 
  he was a regiment-level commander . 
  and a cynical tool who played a large part in the [ nye committee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nye_committee ) and the [ neutrality acts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neutrality_acts_of_1930s ) that kept america out of the chinese civil war and the sino-japanese wars and the first years of wwii . 
  and imagine what it would have been like if america had never entered the war , and hitler had actually won . 
  that 's why we do n't listen to smedley butlers anymore . 
   you are also aware of the large ammo transport to eastern europe ? 
  who is gon na pay for that ? 
  where does that money come from ? 
  let me answer that : taxes . 
  who wants to cash that tax money ? 
  the mic . 
  shockingly , weapons cost money . 
   you are aware of the reasons behind pearl harbor , are n't you ? 
  you might find an answer if you watch or read the untold history of the united states . 
  everything has a reason . 
   and let 's bring that to the modern day , you are aware of the reasons behind 9/11 , are n't you ? 
  again , everything has a reason . 
  9/11 did n't just fall out of the sky . 
  9/11 happened because of arab religious extremism . 
  pearl harbor happened because of japanese imperialism . 
  everything , indeed , has reasons . 
  conspiracy theorists use a single reason to explain everything . 
  ah yes , war is a racket , by smedley butler , the idiot who spent the 1930s telling americans that the axis powers were nothing to worry about . 
  another quote :  at each session of congress the question of further naval appropriations comes up . 
  the swivel-chair admirals of washington ( and there are always a lot of them ) are very adroit lobbyists . 
  and they are smart . 
  they do n't shout that `` we need a lot of battleships to war on this nation or that nation . '', 
  first of all , they let it be known that america is menaced by a great naval power . 
  almost any day , these admirals will tell you , the great fleet of this supposed enemy will strike suddenly and annihilate 125,000,000 people . 
  just like that . 
  then they begin to cry for a larger navy . 
  for what ? 
  to fight the enemy ? 
  oh my , no . 
  for defense purposes only . 
   then , incidentally , they announce maneuvers in the pacific . 
  for defense . 
  uh , huh . 
  six years later , pearl harbor . 
  he 's been a high-ranking diplomat for four months . 
   on the other hand : british historian timothy garton ash , writing in the guardian , and the new york times were astonishingly united in their verdict that angela merkel is the `` liberal west 's last defender . '', 
  the writer gary shteyngart , who emigrated to the us as the son of russian-jewish parents , tweeted : `` germany and canada should form the league of decent nations . '', 
  the fact that our leftists are like that may have something to do with them losing elections . 
  since people almost inevitably convince themselves that they 're right , especially in politics , i think it can be safely assumed that any politician believes he or she is acting in the national interest . 
  exactly . 
  the house of saud is full of reformers , but there 's a limit to what they can do . 
  crown prince abdullah ( later king abdullah ) warned bush about this in a private letter : `` those governments that do n't feel the pulse of their people and respond to it will suffer the fate of the shah of iran . '', 
  we seem to be rather different than [ most people ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/11/trump-cant-win-election-america-political-earthquake ) think we are . 
  that is such a 2004 attitude . 
  names not on either list : india , china , brazil , argentina , south africa ... 
   four british fighter planes arrived in japan in october to take part in exercises with japanese forces at a time of rising tensions over china 's pursuit of disputed territory in east asia , including the south and east china seas . 
   japan 's ambassador , kenichiro sasae , said the united states , japan and britain discussed greater naval cooperation at a meeting at the pentagon in october and tokyo welcomed greater british involvement in asian security . 
  pfft cooperation . 
  [ make the japanese navy imperial again .

  but i do n't think your baggage is comparable to the baggage others have . 
  and it 's not just what you did n't do , but also what did n't happen to you . 
  and it 's not crazy to believe that europe is the wrong choice . 
  the only really strong argument for the continental side is economic . 
  the uk is also different in that the last world war is n't a source of shame but its `` finest hour . '', 
  there is n't the desire to erase the past that is present in some nations . 
  even china is beating us . 
  do n't misunderstand me . 
  i also grew up in the middle of nowhere and i know how hard it can be to get somewhere from there , that 's all . 
  this is part of the reason for trump 's election . 
  dissatisfaction in nowhere . 
  maybe not , but there will be fewer and fewer jobs involved . 
  yeah but when the mines are gone and the oil is gone , you 're left with nowhere . 
  it 's a problem . 
  in a more densely populated country it would be easier for individuals to find new opportunities or to get different forms of education as mentioned above . 
  it 's very difficult in nowhere . 
  why not ? 
  people tell me they 're the best . 
  a lot of smart people say they are . 
  it 's something we need to look into . 
   it 'll be funny to watch . 
  we have the best allies . 
  a lot of our problems are because people live in the middle of nowhere . 
  third largest country by land area . 
  geography hurts . 
   the only possible way to change that is through a unified eu that can be considered the us 's equal . 
  [ you do n't seem to have grasped what 's been going on lately .

  so , still fun and games then . 
  our ambassadors actually never serve more than a few years at the same post anyway . 
  if they 're political appointees , they resign when the president leaves office , and if they 're foreign service officers they 're rotated every three years . 
  it 's a fairly brutal policy meant to eliminate the danger of [ going native . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clientitis ), 
  it happens . 
  john kennedy appointing robert kennedy as attorney general is the highest i can think of .
