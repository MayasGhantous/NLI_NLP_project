  a board of trustees formally appoints the editor , who can not be removed without its permission . 
  it 's not a conspiracy theory that those who own media outlets are interested in the points of view they promote . 
  you people calling me an anti-semite , trump supporter , conspiracy theorist , etc. 
  and giving me negative karma for taking a non-globalist position are exactly the kind of assholes you claim to hate . 
  still have n't read it , have you ? 
  why bother , when you already know everything , right ? 
  just like you saw through my facade of legitimate political beliefs to perceive the dark abyss of jew-hatred that really drives me . 
  [ found the judgmental ass !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/5569yo/philippines_leader_likens_himself_to_hitler_wants/d883ycb/ ), 
  oh fuck you and your need to hate . 
  my comment was obviously aimed at the globalist sentiment of the article and there was nothing anti-semitic about it . 
  that 's not what i said . 
  but the author clearly does n't approve of national sovereignty :  the assertion of the ** nation as the most important civic body ** is a disheartening development in case you 're unaware , the assertion of the nation as the most important ( sovereign ) civic body is what the phrase * national sovereignty * means . 
   and second , let me draw your attention to one very important word in that ultimate sentence : self-reliant . 
  what is this `` self '' ? 
  the typical briton will not become more self-reliant as a result of brexit . 
  the chap behind the bar at the pub will not suddenly find himself cobbling his own shoes and milling his own flour because of the vote to leave the eu . 
  mr ip seems to intend the self , in this case , to be britain . 
  that may have been what voters intended ; the assertion of the nation as the most important ** civic body ** is a disheartening development if so . 
  [ ... ] it is a vote against cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism . 
  nothing in the decline in sterling is going to make that adjustment less painful to those being shut out of the circle of british life . 
  neither should it make us optimistic that deglobalisation can occur without a great deal of accompanying ugliness . 
  oh the horror . 
  the concept of a nation as a civil body politic . 
  the idea of * national sovereignty . 
  * the notion of actual love of country as a valid motivation in civic discourse . 
  god save us from these barbarians . 
  little-known trivia : [ the economist is 50 % owned by the english branch of the rothschild family and by the agnelli family through its holding company , exor . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_economist ), 
  you were talking about norway , which gets a large part of its budget from oil money . 
  the part you quoted about religion only said that many people volunteer through religious organizations , which is true . 
  and we do n't have volunteerism to compensate for a lack of development . 
  between our two hemispheres , there 's actually a pretty noticeable difference in people 's basic desire to help . 
  you nordics do n't even hold doors open for each other . 
  or talk to each other , or look at each other . 
  it 's actually kind of puzzling how you 've ended up with a welfare state . 
   why would answering ` yes ' to a volunteering question have anything to do with human development as they claim ? 
  ... because human development is about more than the amount of money you get from your state-owned oil company ? 
  all per-capita statistics are biased in favor of smaller countries anyway , which you can observe from a single glance at any of these lists . 
  costa rica , one of the world 's poorest countries , is in the top 10 for health and well-being ? 
  really ? 
  the scandinavian countries constantly get boosted to the top of every international ranking for the same reason . 
  i do n't know what you have to complain about . 
  interesting that the german-settled area is now defined as the [ `` heartland . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heartland_ ( united_states \\ ) ), 
   us wanted nothing to do with it . 
  not true . 
  the us took a side , and so did obama . 
  the leak was probably intended to derail it . 
  a lesson for those who say the us is too nationalistic is the number of americans who are always willing to oppose and discredit everything it does . 
  it 's an anti-war blog ... 
  the us intelligence community incorporates a lot of redundancy . 
  the cia has its own department , the center for cyber intelligence . 
  it 's the smarmy , pretentious know-nothing / know-it-all attitude of the author . 
  like describing it as unusual that the ship is accompanied by a tug . 
  the russian navy incorporates tugs into all of its fleet formations . 
  and describing it as `` the kremlin 's latest attempt to reassert its lost superpower status . '', 
  really ? 
  after years of watching putin defeat obama from ukraine to syria , derailing bush by vetoing un authorization for the liberation of iraq ( and enlisting france and germany to help him with that ) , manipulating our elections and public opinion , the tone seems rather unwarranted . 
  i did n't say they were perfect . 
  and they have had 400 years of democracy and prosperity . 
  the corporations !, 
  they make our lives possible , damn them !, 
  but requiring * unanimous * agreement by all member states is something else . 
  if canada or the us required the unanimous approval of all of our member states in order to ratify a treaty , we would n't have any treaties . 
  why not just take a vote ? 
  this article reads like a 14-year-old 's book report . 
  that 's not what i said . . 
  [ wiki  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatherland )  fatherland is the nation of one 's `` fathers '' , `` forefathers '' or `` ancestors '' . 
  well , you said it was a form of narcissism . 
  the article calls it `` virtue '' and gives a more complicated picture . 
  i mean , maybe nationalism is like narcissism , but narcissism is also something everyone possesses in some quantity and is necessary for psychological health . 
  imo , eu euronationalism is also much like ours . 
  it 's an all-volunteer army . 
   you should read the article i linked . 
  it addresses your points . 
  it does n't really support your thesis , though :  first , american nationalism is based on political ideals , not those of cultural or ethnic superiority . 
  that conception is entirely fitting for a society that still sees itself as a cultural and ethnic melting pot . 
  [ ... ] american nationalism is forward looking , while nationalism in most other countries is the reverse . 
   i think the difference is that while they are similar , patriotism is inclusive to all who would call themselves american that 's actually what american [ nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_nationalism ) is about . 
   now there are other people like trump for instance who i would call nationalistic . 
  i would just call them traitors . 
  in english , at least , the word [ * patriotism * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriotism ) refers to a simple emotional attachment to one 's home or people , while [ * nationalism * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalism ) refers to what is essentially a political belief in their existence as a nation . 
  so , a patriotic qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is anyone from qu\u00e9bec who is proud to be from qu\u00e9bec , while [ nationalist qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quebec_nationalism ) are those who say that qu\u00e9bec is a nation distinct from canada . 
  politics within the eu make this a little tricky , but personally , i 'd want anyone i voted for to be both a nationalist and a patriot . 
  so was baba yetu catering to the swahili market ? 
  it 's an italian song written by a chinese american composer with lyrics by leonardo da vinci . 
  it would be interesting to read a complete thesis on what it implies about whom . 
  there was an interesting moment [ ( permalink ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/58i7xy/hi_rciv_christopher_tin_here_with_lyric_videos/d90m773?context=3 ) in / u/christophertin 's ama thread , when tin described the music as nationalistic and someone chimed in to tell him that maybe he should use a different word , since nationalism has negative connotations . 
   naghawi is a member of afghanistan 's shi'ite community , hundreds of thousands of whom were persecuted by the taliban in the 1990s so when he gets to afghanistan , maybe he 'd like to join the army and fight for others like himself . 
  i know , we 've barely had 400 years of constitutional democracy , and 240 under one government . 
  we 're dumb . 
   a common military forces a common foreign policy . 
  [ ... ] if the eu controls the military the eu is effectively a federal state and would begin to be considering a real country rather than merely a supranational organization . 
  that 's exactly what i mean , and i believe it 's why renzi and merkel are pushing for it . 
  as long as it 's just talk , a common foreign policy can be debated forever and a consensus may never appear . 
  a common military basically forces the issue . 
  a common military leads to a common foreign policy , not the other way around . 
  [ i rather like it .
