  actually , the french government criticized us ( during obama 's term ) for * not * intervening in syria :  prime minister of france manuel valls told goldberg that `` by not intervening early , we have created a monster . 
  we were absolutely certain that the u.s. administration would say yes . 
  working with the americans , we had already seen the targets . 
  it was a great surprise . 
  if we had bombed as was planned , i think things would be different today . '', 
   http://freebeacon.com/national-security/obama-furious-clinton-criticizing-foreign-policy/ and of course they dragged us into libya too . 
  stop using us as a scapegoat for your regional instability . 
  our hemisphere has pretty much been at peace for the last 200 years . 
  in general , i 'm suspicious of protesters , especially people waving signs in support of what both the us and eu consider a terrorist network . 
  4 hours after your first reply and you come back with another ? 
  i see you 've been thinking about this . 
   oh please . 
  you do n't even have a left-wing , what universe do you think there is a `` far-left '' in the us . 
  see , this is what i mean . 
  we do have a left , * our * left . 
  it 's different from your left because it evolved in a country without the authoritarianism , aristocracy , class warfare and revolution that created your left . 
  but to you , there 's only one left , and it must conform to yours . 
  that 's the poison that will continue to infect us now that we share a language . 
   as long as we start doing things our way , no longer taking the sides of corrupt nations like the us , the saudis and all the rest of the garbage then everything is setup for us to influence and push the world in the right direction , go for it . 
  the sooner you get back to pushing the world in your direction , the sooner we can rediscover our traditional role as the more openminded westerners . 
  ok . who , then , is your friend ? 
  continental europe has fairly bad relations with all of its neighbors : russia , turkey , the middle east , north africa , even the uk now . 
  if we 're not your friends , then do you have any friends ? 
  it 's not just me who thinks it : https://janyobytes.wordpress.com/2017/01/30/eus-chief-brexit-negotiator-trumps-brand-of-american-populism-came-from-europe/ it 'd be better for both of our continents to not be as close as we are . 
  we have reasons for being different . 
  you might have a system that works fine for you , but that does n't mean it 'll work fine for us . 
  and the system we have might not work for you . 
  people should be free to develop their own way . 
  but when we all speak the same language , that 's not going to happen . 
  jeez , you do n't get it . 
  those talking about impeachment are part of the problem . 
  literally every president we have is a traitor and must be impeached according to one side of our politics - trump , obama , bush , clinton , etc. 
  every one . 
  that 's not a good thing . 
  if anything threatens our country , it 's this constant screaming tantrum that either the far-right or the far-left is throwing at literally every moment of our lives . 
  as for europe , it would be better for many reasons if we were never allies , and we never would have been if not for the world wars . 
  the fact that europeans speak english now and we 're becoming ever more politically interconnected with your continent is a disaster . 
  it means we 'll eventually be recolonized by a foreign political culture , one that is very different from ours and actually hostile to it in some ways . 
  turn what around ? 
  would definitely be better for us , sorry . 
  but ca n't happen . 
  when you guys decided to make english your common language , you chained us together forever . 
   so foreign military/security personnel attacked us civilians on us soil , and nothing was done about it ? 
  come on , framing it as an attack is a little extreme . 
  it was at an ambassador 's residence . 
  speaking as a dc resident , we all know to watch out for cars with embassy plates , because they do n't have to obey the traffic laws . 
  also , in [ this video , ] ( http://www.amerikaninsesi.com/a/turk-buyukelciligi-onunde-kavga/3853601.html#player-start-time=2.546564 ) which was before the alleged attack [ ( seen in this video ) ] ( https://twitter.com/voaturkish/status/864631567972540417 ) , the protesters are throwing things ( including a megaphone ) at the security agents and government supporters , some of whom are bleeding . 
  and they 're waving signs supporting a terrorist group . 
  i do n't think they came to protest peacefully . 
  yeah , someone says `` he 's a piece of shit terrorist '' at one point . 
  also , is the guy in the blue shirt who 's fighting at the start of the video the same guy who 's being arrested at 56 seconds ? 
  the video starts * in medias res . 
  * that guy with the megaphone who goes down at 15 seconds - at the start of the video you can see him kicking the guy in the suit . 
  the video does n't show anything before that . 
  i think we should let the police investigate . 
  why ? 
  is there any evidence other than the protesters ' statements to indicate they were attacked ? 
   and as a final point , why does the colour scale differ from us map of the same study ? 
  the color scale shows the range from highest to lowest , red to blue . 
  it 's not going to be the same on two different continents because the range of responses is n't the same . 
   first of all how do you define 0.444 racist ? 
  `` in every country in europe , people are slower to associate blackness with positive words such as `` good '' or `` nice '' and faster to associate blackness with negative concepts such as `` bad '' or `` evil '' . '', 
  some of the deep south states were majority black in the 1800s . 
  that 's one reason they kept slavery as long as they did , because they feared the consequences of `` black rule '' . 
  most of the other states would still be solid blue if not for the [ great migration . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_migration_ ( african_american \\ ) ), 
  thanks for the correction . 
  i also realized that i should n't have phrased it as `` less racist than us , '' because that makes it a competition and that 's not the point . 
  but there are some people who basically think their country has evolved to the point that it no longer has widespread racial prejudice and that just strikes me as bizarre , whatever country it is . 
  also , something that should be considered is that there 's a fairly reliable correlation ( at least on our continent ) between negative perceptions of black people and the number of black people present in a population : https://randomcriticalanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/project_implicit_heat_map.png i mean , it 's logical : it 's just easier to like other people when you live far away from them and never see them . 
  at least that 's the case in my family . 
  sorry to be expressing schadenfreude at this , but i 'm glad these studies are being done more often . 
  i do n't know how many times someone on this sub has brought up american racism with no irony whatsoever . 
  it just seems incredible to me , but nations who were the most fanatically racist on the planet less than a lifetime ago believe they 're less racist than us today . 
  even if our media is partly to blame . 
   and what did the us do after the revolution ? 
  they granted asylum to pahlavi , the very man america helped overthrow . 
  what ? 
  america helped overthrow mohammed reza pahlavi ? 
  when ?? 
  the house of pahlavi was our ally . 
  where are you even getting this ?? 
   the us were there to serve their own interests and nothing more . 
  can you imagine how annoying it would be if your country were the constant target of every ignorant teenage edgelord in the entire western world ? 
  no , really . 
  just to give one example :  iran , for instance , before the cia backed revolution was a thriving secular state . 
  the us did n't want another nation adopting socialist policies or government so brought a brutal islamist that still hangs over the country today . 
  before what you 're referring to , iran was a feudal theocracy in which most of the population were serfs living on land owned by the clergy . 
  the government we supported [ abolished feudalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_revolution#reforms ) and slavery , instituted national healthcare and education , extended the right to vote to women and jews , and took the land away from the clergy and gave it to the people . 
  that 's why the ayatollahs hated it . 
  literally everything you said was the complete opposite of the truth , which imo should tell you something about your sources of information . 
  literally everything you said in this comment was wrong . 
  i was going to reply to it point-by-point , but it just kept building and building and now i 'm depressed . 
  sorry , no . 
  i meant i do n't need judges like scalia to like me . 
  for the record i 'm bi , and yeah , it 's not a judge 's job to like anyone . 
  well , we intentionally make it difficult to get things done . 
  here 's scalia on it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggz_gd--uo0&amp;t=1m24s, 
   if i had the chance to make a country from scratch , i would definite law as a contract between individuals and their peers , and nothing more than that . 
  in new england , the first colonial government was created from scratch , on that exact basis , as a mutual [ contract ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mayflower_compact ) between individuals .
