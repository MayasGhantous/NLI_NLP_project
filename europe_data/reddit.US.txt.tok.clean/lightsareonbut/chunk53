  other colonial governments also started off as legal contracts , since they were [ owned by corporations .

  our democracy is based on that shit .

  you 'll never fail like common law . 
  you 'll never watch your legislation slide out of view . 
  russian by birth , began his journalism career in france , currently lives in germany . 
  anyway , it could be that the french are just smarter than us . 
  i 'm not ruling it out ; i just found the bluntness of it remarkable . 
  i read it . 
  like i said , very french . 
  another interpretation might be : since the united states is an english-speaking country , it 's easier to flood our infospace with bots and fake news than it is to flood france 's . 
  i remember this sub making the same point , when talking about how r/le _ pen users were n't having an impact because they spoke poor french and their memes made no grammatical sense . 
   the spread of fakes was thwarted by french voters ' relative sophistication compared with american ones ; xd that 's such a french interpretation . 
   i could name more ... but if you are an american who does n't plan to travel to europe , i do n't know . 
  maybe there 's no opportunity `` for you '' . 
  but you should think in a more global perspective ... you mean how we 've already lost control of our own internet and infospace due to the global spread of english , and how european politics and viewpoints are infecting ours ? 
  if you look at it in a `` global '' perspective , the growth of the eu really is n't a positive thing for the us at all . 
  it means the eventual hegemony of continental europe over the english-speaking world . 
  i still support it , basically , but it 's disingenuous to call it a good thing for americans , because it 's not . 
  no , see , we actually have data on this . 
  german/french/etc opinions during the refugee crisis were actually better than they were on average over the last 15 years : http://www.pewglobal.org/database/indicator/1/survey/all/, 
  here 's a bbc world service poll of countries ' opinions of other countries : http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/country-rating-poll.pdf it 's 2014 but if you can find something more recent i 'm sure the results will be similar . 
  it 's just a fact that americans have a more positive opinion of europe and europeans than the reverse . 
   you do n't see europeans calling for the destruction of the usa and claiming to fight for the sovereignty of the us states . 
  what ? 
  only all the time . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/shiteuropeanssay/comments/607sha/i_for_one_am_prepared_to_die_fighting_the/ ffs , there are even protests whenever obama ( i hate having to say trump now ) visits a european country . 
  europeans ' opinions are way more hostile than the reverse . 
  any poll will confirm this . 
  it 's not just a stereotype . 
  it 's an opinion of our education system , an undeservedly negative one . 
  you asked for an example . 
  you have the same negative view of our entire society . 
  i did n't say we had the highest . 
  but higher than france , sweden , etc. 
  i 'd bet that 90 % of europeans would get that wrong . 
  do you honestly disagree ? 
  this is a personal crusade of u/mightierthanthou , but he 's basically right . 
  as an example , if you asked europeans from any country to rank five countries ( usa , france , norway , sweden , iceland ) by science test scores , i think you 'd expect the usa to be ranked as # 5 , instead of # 1 , [ which it is . 
  ] ( https://data.oecd.org/pisa/science-performance-pisa.htm ) the view of americans as poorly educated is just that universal , even without any basis in reality . 
  [ it gets even more mind-blowing ... ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7 ), 
  guy , you 're falling for their bullshit . 
  you do n't even know if those americans [ actually are american . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7 ) like i said , it 's impossible to tell what 's real over there . 
  china prefers to just [ wall itself off ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/02/great-wall-culture-china-launch-version-wikipedia/ ) from the rest of us . 
  there 's no need to focus specifically on the uk . 
  [ we got this from europe in general . 
  ] ( https://janyobytes.wordpress.com/2017/01/30/eus-chief-brexit-negotiator-trumps-brand-of-american-populism-came-from-europe/ ) and :  the uk conservatives are galvanized by the us religious fanaticism , racism and mccarthyism oh you guys . 
  black canadians are more over-represented in prison than black americans . 
  the us is n't especially racist in any way . 
  we just talk more about it . 
  it 's impossible to tell what 's real on that sub . 
  one of their top posts at the moment is [ this one . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/69u7lz/what_france_needs_asap/ ), 
  the author is the 2017 winner of the charlemagne prize for contributions to european integration ... 
  i 'm actually sorry that the election 's over , because now you guys are going to stop wasting your time spamming the internet with ignorant shit about france and go back to wasting your time spamming the internet with ignorant shit about your own country . 
  and that does n't make any sense . 
  nations do n't change that much in a day , or even a generation . 
  if you think that about britain today , you ca n't have thought much differently about it yesterday . 
  no , identity politics is something is totally different . 
  it 's what the author 's doing , actually . 
  i said * a center . 
  * and he said `` or so i have believed , '' which implies that he does n't believe it anymore . 
  it does n't make sense to me . 
  i really ca n't imagine much that could cause me to abandon my perception of the us , its people , its political culture , its civil society , its basic enlightenment - or my perception of the uk 's , for that matter . 
  and i do n't see how anyone whose opinions are this firmly established could alter them so quickly and so radically . 
  i think , in order to be questioning whether the uk deserves to be called a country of the enlightenment , you ca n't really have had much belief in that to begin with . 
  reading up on this author , i get the impression that he 's never really had faith in britain , but only in europe . 
  it 's not about being unhappy . 
  i 'm unhappy with the current us government . 
  it 's more about the conclusions he draws , from current events , about his country , its future and its democracy . 
  if you think britain is a center of the enlightenment , how can you think it 's that wrong ? 
  the two things do n't compute . 
   britain is a country of the european enlightenment , or so i have thought . 
  if this is true , then why does he have such little faith in it ? 
  i really do n't understand these people . 
  after years of trying to create an eu army , they finally gave up and rented one of ours . 
  south america has never had actual fascism , or any kind of totalitarianism . 
  even pinochet left office when he was voted out . 
  fascism is only found in traditionally autocratic countries . 
  it also separates by color , brightness , font and other things . 
  to test it , you can scan a few documents yourself and look at the layers you get . 
  yeah , it does that . 
  it 's probably because the `` tel : '' is bold and the number is n't . 
  it looks like it put all the bolded text on one layer . 
  and that 's really the kind of decision that only a machine would make . 
  that 's really the only part that my brain categorizes as european . 
  yeah , not only can it do this - it does it by default . 
  discernible text objects are automatically assigned to separate layers with an optimized scan . 
  to be honest , it would be better for us if you stopped learning english . 
  the spread of english has become more of a hindrance to us since the internet was created . 
  it gives everyone in the world access to our infospace . 
  if you did n't speak english , you 'd be discussing this only on european websites , not ours . 
   wait a second ... did you just say the us ' government is more alien to us than fucking china ? 
  what 's more european than an imperialist totalitarian regime ? 
  they even have goose-stepping and big portraits of karl marx . 
  it 's a fact :  in all three of the above dimensions , the us has consistently been the leader among the 34 countries analyzed . 
  you even pointed it out earlier , with your comment about how we 're all such flag-waving patriots and how deeply ingrained that is in our culture . 
  if there 's anything we 're good at , it 's social cohesion .
