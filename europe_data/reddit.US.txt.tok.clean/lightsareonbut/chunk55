  probably , the nation who invented both communism and fascism ( co-creator ) would have some nightmarish totalitarian system of their own creation , and there 's a good chance they would have destroyed civilization . 
  i 'm guessing you came here from r/shitamericanssay , right ? 
  listen , europeans and especially germans are n't as smart as they think they are . 
  that 's all i 'll say about it . 
  the government ultimately answers to the people , yes . 
  it says `` us , '' which is a nation . 
  and in any case we 're a republic , so you ca n't really separate the two . 
  for anyone still reading : blocked . 
  holy shit we 're done . 
  do i need to block you ? 
  [ i said we 're done . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/65i503/german_opinion_poll_do_you_think_is_a_partner_we/dgg8i4z/ ), 
  sorry readers , but we 're done . 
  of course i know what / u/lyrical _ forklift means , as i 'm pretty sure i 've demonstrated by now , but it 's irrelevant because i never said the cia has n't committed atrocities . 
  every powerful country has . 
  that 's just stating a fact i 've never denied in the first place in an effort to move the goalpost . 
  i said some things about chile , for which i was called uninformed , for reasons which have yet to be explained . 
  i 'm just waiting for you to answer the goddamn question like you 're interested in history or in having a real conversation in which you might learn something . 
  also showing me some of this propaganda you say exists and is fed to us by our government , and to me specifically . 
  also ,  if you were aware then you 'd understand why the world distrusts you . 
  confirmed : [ japan not part of world . 
  ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/04/07/americans-japanese-mutual-respect-70-years-after-the-end-of-wwii/ ) / u/lyrical _ forklift, 
  i did n't say they 've never committed atrocities so that 's kinda irrelevant . 
  ca n't you answer the question ? 
  did you know any of that ? 
  how am i less informed than you ? 
  what 's this propaganda that you think my country has `` fed '' me ? 
  i 'd be interested to read/watch some examples - do you have any ? 
  is this alleged propaganda even a thing that exists in reality ? 
  why not answer the question ? 
  did you know any of that ? 
  how am i uninformed ? 
  hint : when you have two people in a conversation and one of them is accusing the other 's country of `` oppressing the world , '' that person is probably suffering more from propaganda . 
  and hey , you 're assuming to know more about my country 's history than i do while accusing me of `` veering into / r/iamverysmart territory , '' for even more self-unawareness . 
  really ? 
  were you actually aware of anything i 've mentioned ? 
  if not , is n't it kind of obvious which of us is better informed ? 
  first you assumed i was `` fed propaganda '' and did n't know about these things , and now that you know that i know about them , it 's even more proof that i 've been `` fed propaganda . '', 
  again , i probably know everything you know , and more . 
  another example : i know that pinochet left office when he was voted out . 
  and the role of juntas in the history of chilean democracy , starting with the [ first junta . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_junta_of_chile_ ( 1810 \\ ) ) if you really knew the history of these events , you would n't see them in such a black-and-white way . 
   i appreciate you 're pro american and it 's good to be proud of your country 's accomplishments but you need to stop buying all the propaganda your country feeds you and investigate things further . 
  go read up on the cia would be a good start comments like this just show that you do n't understand us . 
  you think anything you know would be news to me , that it contradicts the propaganda we 're fed ? 
  it is the propaganda we 're fed . 
  that 's why you 've heard of it . 
  almost all americans believe the cia is some evil conspiracy . 
  polls regularly show that americans are more skeptical of our government and leaders than any other western nation . 
  your idea of americans being indoctrinated by propaganda is itself propaganda of the most extreme variety . 
  americans with my opinions are a distinct minority because we know more than the oliver stone propaganda version of history . 
  example : i know what the cia did in chile . 
  unlike you ( i 'm guessing ) i also know that salvador allende [ was a kgb plant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chilean_presidential_election,_1970 ) and a traitor who killed himself to avoid answering for his crimes . 
  why do you know something about the cia 's role in chile , but nothing about the kgb 's role ? 
  because telling both sides of a story is n't what propagandists do . 
   i know how the us government works and i 'm well aware of ` checks and balances ' but the fact of the matter is the president still has a huge amount of power . 
  hence why he could bomb syria without approval . 
  he does n't actually have that power . 
  it belongs to congress . 
  he only has it because of the war powers resolution passed by congress , but they can revoke it anytime . 
  but you 're disproving yourself , because bombing syria was a very anti-russian move and made putin furious , and trump himself even originally spoke out against it , so if anything , this would show that he does n't have the power you say he does and there 's no danger of collusion with russia . 
  as for the us bullying the world into submission , the eu has signed trade treaties with canada and mexico , but not with us . 
  you must be talking about some other world , which makes sense since you seem to be referring to an alternate timeline in general . 
  so maybe what you do n't get is that our government is n't a parliamentary system , i.e. 
  the president is n't the head of the legislature , or even head of his own party , and even the actual party leader does n't have any control over the party members . 
  literally anyone can enter the republican or democratic party , and who gets their nomination is decided entirely by the voters , thanks to the primary election system . 
  bernie sanders and donald trump just joined their parties last year and both were hated by the party `` leadership . '', 
  this is unlike a parliamentary system , where the most influential members of the party simply select their leader , who then exercise control over the members ' viewpoints . 
  thus , what goes for trump does n't go for the us or even republicans generally . 
  our system is much more individualistic than that . 
  and , obviously , republicans are not pro-russian . 
   i live in new zealand . 
  i did n't ask where you live . 
  you 're not a new zealander by birth , are you ? 
   because the president has a lot of sway funnily enough . 
  also was a huge chunk of the population that voted for him . 
  are you really saying that a huge chunk of the us population is pro-russian , or that pro-russian viewpoints have `` a lot of sway '' ? 
  because that 's ridiculous . 
  so again , how does `` trump '' become `` us ? '', 
  you made his ties with russia the subject . 
  how does that statement about him become something applicable to the us , which obviously is very unlike him in that specific way ? 
   even if you disregard trump the us has done plenty to warrant distrust . 
  how many democracies have they overthrown ? 
  how many wars have they got involved in to further their own agenda ? 
  how much damage has the cia done in south america , south east asia and the middle east ? 
   also your ` protection ' was n't born out of altruism . 
  it was so you could [ ... ] basically bully the world into submission . 
  ok i get it , you have a very negative opinion of the united states and basically see it as an evil force bullying the world into `` submission . '', 
  what is your nationality ? 
  yes , exactly that 's the point . 
  how does `` trump '' become `` us ? '', 
  has the us ever been pro-russia ? 
  are you german , by any chance ? 
  originally , from stalin . 
  and from their neighbors and ( honestly ) from themselves . 
  i really ca n't express how stupid it is to base your opinion of the world 's 3rd largest nation on one individual . 
  i do n't recall who the current president and pm of poland are , but i know poland is and will continue to be a solid ally . 
  and i know that france will continue to be sometimes reliable and sometimes not , depending on the issue . 
  france is france and poland is poland . 
  i ca n't comprehend changing my opinion of a nation because of one guy .
