  also , the usual explanation `` they choose to live like that '' just sounds like [ this .

  no , and i 'm not commenting on it ; i 'm giving some context as to what might create the impression . 
   [ second un emergency order : macedonia must rehouse pregnant romani women made homeless by authorities ] ( http://www.errc.org/article/second-un-emergency-order-macedonia-must-rehouse-pregnant-romani-women-made-homeless-by-authorities/4542 )  `` we have no water , no electricity , no heating . 
  i can not even have a bath since it is so cold . 
  i have gone a whole month without a bath , and we are exposed to so many diseases because of these living conditions . '' - explained one of the pregnant women . 
   another said `` our life was a bit better before the evictions , when we had a house . 
  now it is very difficult . 
  we live under the open sky in tents with no water or electricity . 
  we are outside all the time and the weather is very cold . 
  i am a single mother and i have no financial income or social support . ''  once again , we urge the macedonian government to comply with the emergency orders from the un committee and provide these women with the emergency care necessary to ensure their own and their children 's wellbeing . 
  the former yugoslavia tends to be the capital of anti-american sentiment in europe , because we bombed them in the yugoslav wars . 
  of course , most of their fellow europeans ( plus canada ) bombed them more enthusiastically than we did , but we draw most of the aggro . 
  the first position you take in a negotiation is n't the one you actually intend to end up with . 
  you have to start at an extreme position , because you want some space to negotiate , because you do n't want to seem unwilling to compromise , because you do n't want the other side to know exactly what you 'll agree to if you must , and because if the final agreement is what you wanted , or better , giving up your original position prevents the other side from feeling humiliated . 
  all the people in the world who actually want such a war could probably fit inside one bus , and i 'm sure that none of them are presidents or prime ministers . 
  i do n't mean downvotes . 
  it 's more the denial and the upvotes for that . 
  this sub is exactly like / r/askanamerican , and i 've accumulated more downvotes there than here , before realizing it was full of trump voters and being too depressed to go back . 
  i gave him one positive fact about his country that i knew no one here would be conscious of , maybe because the depression in the op reminded me of that . 
  the question was about europe exactly as much as it was about america . 
  the sub is for asking `` europe-related '' questions , which it is . 
  what i said was factual and doubtlessly informative to many , and the hostility incurred speaks for itself . 
  go right ahead . 
  it might be educational for them to actually look this shit up . 
  if it does n't make sense , it 's because of what i 'm pointing out : rather than a multicultural patchwork of people who do n't get along , the us is a single people of many origins welded into one identity , precisely what the melting-pot concept implies . 
  california : 38 million . 
  scotland : 5 million . 
  you 're right . 
  that makes no sense . 
   edit : after i made my comment his was changed from `` cultural harmony '' to `` cultural assimilation '' and there was some more added and taken away , just for clarification . 
  i changed it because i realized i needed to be more clear about what i meant , which is also why i 'm replying to this point now , even though i did n't the first time . 
   you are 8th for social cohesion in the western world , behind 4 european [ scandinavian ] countries so , then , exactly what i said :  one of its most socially cohesive there are dozens of nations in europe . 
  if only 4 can score ( marginally ) better than the us in social cohesion , then the us does social cohesion better than europe - better than any european nation outside scandinavia , despite a large and diverse population , greater income inequality and all the problems you mentioned . 
  and thus it 's an answer to the op 's question : `` what is one thing the u.s. does better than europe ? '', 
  social cohesion , * i.e. , * `` the willingness of members of a society to cooperate with each other in order to survive and prosper , '' is one thing the united states does better than europe , in a discovery described as `` shocking '' by no historians anywhere . 
  now i 'm getting negative karma for having said this , so if you want to argue some more , let 's keep it logical . 
   and after reading the add on about nationalism , i 'd like to add that 's really not seen as a good thing in europe . 
  if you feel it 's important to point out what europeans do n't approve about us , fine . 
  you 're right that most europeans do n't consider nationalism a good thing . 
  but then it 's also true that most europeans ca n't actually define nationalism , or the difference between [ ethnic nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_nationalism ) and [ civic nationalism , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) or how they 're not actually nationalists themselves , and , just perhaps , they might learn something useful if they could . 
   as for foreign born population , i 'm afraid america is 13th behind 8 european countries , canada , israel , australia and new zealand , and at a very similar level to several others . 
  i really do n't want to turn this into a national pissing contest , but that 's irrelevant to what i said . 
  the us now has a population of 325 million vs canada 's 35 million ; it would take 10x as many immigrants to make the foreign-born % of its population the same as canada 's . 
  that stage of our history is over , sadly , and for canada it 's just starting . 
  but what i said was that although 50 % of californians , at least , are foreign-born , there 's no californian independence movement . 
  whereas scotland almost voted for independence 2 years ago , and the uk actually did vote for independence this year . 
  and in canada , for the record , the same situation arose not long ago with quebec . 
  it wo n't arise in america , probably ever , because the national ideas it 's picked up are all on the assimilation and national unity columns . 
   and i feel like there 's a certain amount of bias going on with the melting pot thing . 
  lots of countries have a huge history of immigration and cultural assimilation . 
  our population increased 300 % over the last century alone , and the century before was even more ridiculous . 
  given that it 's the 3rd most populous nation and is 99 % non-indigenous , it 's safe to say that no nation has absorbed as many immigrants . 
  and not all nations value cultural assimilation as much . 
  the uk has traditionally been more about multiculturalism , as have her majesty 's loyal canadian dominions . 
  and it might be a better solution , as long as you can manage it . .  can you find me a study that shows the ethnicity by origin ? 
  i would n't be surprised if america was top , but i 've looked and never found anything to support it other than opinion pieces . 
  a lot of nations do n't keep official statistics on ethnicity , or they use different standards . 
  i do n't have a convenient link , but it is true . 
  i said it was ethnically diverse * by origin , * which is true , and not the same standard you 're employing . 
  you 're talking about actual cultural diversity - for example , the variety of languages spoken . 
  naturally , multicultural canada is a better example of that kind of diversity , as is the uk and most european nations . 
  the point i was making is that american nationalism is n't about multiculturalism , but cultural assimilation . 
  the historical concept of a [ melting pot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melting_pot ) is a national blender that absorbs diversity and creates uniformity . 
  basically what is said in the national motto : [ `` from many , one . 
  because i doubt anyone will say it : cultural assimilation . 
  america has the western world 's largest and most diverse ( by ethnic origin ) population , and one of its most [ socially cohesive , ] ( http://www.bfna.org/media_advisory/u-s-social-cohesion-high-unaffected-by-immigration ) at the same time . 
  only about 2 % of texans , the most separatist state , would vote for independence from the united states . 
  this is despite the populations of some states ( california ) being 48 % foreign-born . 
  that 's the consequence of a highly [ nationalist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_nationalism ) culture evolving over centuries of large-scale immigration , gradually embracing an inclusive melting-pot ideal . 
  you want to ban political lobbying for anything other than social democrat policies ? 
  and you 'd make people swear an oath to an economic system to be allowed to vote ? 
  lobbying that is counter to indigenous european values ? 
  what exactly does that mean ? 
   when you realise that america is now voting for everything the country once stood against . 
  so far only the republican party has done that , and he only got an actual majority of them in the very last primaries . 
  in the 1600s sure , but by the time of independence , the population of america was more than half that of england . 
  in britain , the american colonies were simply called ` the colonies . ', 
  in some ways , they * were * the empire , or the only part of it that could compete with britain itself in influence . 
  disagree with what ? 
  it could certainly be done better , but a physical embodiment of american social studies classes is quite an interesting concept for a superhero . 
  it 's actually been 429 years since virginia was named for liz i. 
  i meant it seems to blend together in what i remember from secondary education in the us . 
  i recall the french revolution and its influence . 
  nothing ( incredibly ) about the irish famine , or even the empire . 
  we actually have the same amount of history . 
  i remember learning about magna carta , the wars of religion , etc. 
  but then everything in europe from 1776 to 1914 kind of blends together , and it sucks . 
  and if there 's one thing we should be taught more about , it 's historical uk/us relations . 
  things like the influence of the english civil war on american democracy , and the american civil war on british democracy , are n't well understood on either side of the atlantic . 
  it seems such a shame to leave so much out . 
  us and uk history is so interrelated , you 're missing a lot of your own history there as well . 
  of course , i do n't think our system is any better . 
   either you have no idea what is meant by `` fractionalisation '' or you 're playing dumb . 
  either you have no idea what is meant by words like * linguistic * and * cultural * or you 're playing dumb . 
   after the statement about the irish becoming `` less irish '' whilst you burgers became `` more irish '' , i 'm inclined to think you 're not playing dumb . 
  [ the fact that you 're not aware of something does n't make someone else dumb .

   getting quite close to the bingo you know , we do n't even have a bingo , because we do n't do that kind of thing , but if we wanted to , it 'd be quite easy . 
   sure , if you exclude the 84 more ethnically diverse nations .
