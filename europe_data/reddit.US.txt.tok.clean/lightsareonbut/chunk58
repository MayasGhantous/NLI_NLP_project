  and this would be getting you closer . 
  that 's not the same measurement . 
  i just said that the us was most diverse * by origin , * and you replied with a list that measures diversity by `` ethnic , cultural , linguistic and religious * fractionalization . 
  '' * the whole point of the united states is that we are diverse in our origins but * not * fractionalized by them . 
  so , ` i 'm not listening ' ...  sorry if facts damage your superiourity complex . 
  ` projecting cultural arrogance . ', 
  one more box ...   if americans are defined by nothing but shared values , than anyone who shares those values can be an american . 
   but they are n't . 
  ` let me educate you about your national concepts ! ', 
  ] ( http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/extrait-tintin-au-congo-2.jpg ), 
  ah , that second link is actually net favorability , which is favorable minus unfavorable , so it 's lower than just favorable . 
  in south korea , america 's at 85 % favorable , and 70 % in ukraine and japan . 
  [ and that 's lower than usual for japan . 
  ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/04/07/americans-japanese-mutual-respect-70-years-after-the-end-of-wwii/ ), 
   every ( large ) nation has a history of arrogance haha , and some smaller ones , right ? 
   though none so pronounced as the doctrine of american exceptionalism , which you 've been regurgitating quite enthusiastically . 
  [ europeans saw it as their duty to teach civilization to the rest of the world . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilizing_mission ) that 's not less arrogant than us , is it ? 
  and that was less than a hundred years ago . 
  you belgians had tintin doing it . 
  people do n't change that much within a human lifetime . 
   a whole lot of you guys like to engage in claiming to be irish or whatever ( by the way , that 's no different from otherkin claiming they 're tigers ) 25 % of ireland moved to the united states in the 1800s . 
  they 've become less ` irish ' since then , but the rest of us have become more ` irish . ', 
  irish music transformed american music , for example . 
  that 's how it 's supposed to work . 
  we do n't really do multiculturalism ; we do assimilation . 
  [ your biological and cultural distinctiveness will be added to our own . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melting_pot )  it 's also a distinction . 
  black germans are just germans , not `` african-germans '' . 
  nobody in poland identifies as irish-polish or swedish-polish , either . 
  every belgian i know identifies as either flemish or walloon . 
  but that 's not the kind of distinction you were talking about . 
  both are belgian . 
  and there are swedish americans , chinese americans , irish americans , korean americans , and all are 100 % american . 
  being from a different place does n't make you less american . 
  we 're * all * from different places and we 're all american . 
  that 's basically the whole idea of america : [ * ` one out of many . 
  ' * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e_pluribus_unum ) and we need those labels . 
  how can we talk about discrimination against asian americans if we ca n't say ` asian americans ? ', 
  dropping some science on this thread : 1 . 
  americans are ( in terms of ethnic origin ) the most diverse nation in the world . 
  at the same time , we 're [ one of the most socially cohesive in the world ] ( http://www.bfna.org/media_advisory/u-s-social-cohesion-high-unaffected-by-immigration ) , narrowly beaten by scandinavia , canada , nz and oz ( the last three all having a similar take on nationality to us , and scandinavian cohesion being subsidized by the oil industry ) . 
  we also have one of the [ highest rates of assimilation ] ( https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/comparing-immigrant-assimilation-north-america-and-europe-5846.html ) . 
  i think every nation is exceptional , but this is one of several things about america that are exceptional . 
  we exceed almost the entire world in diversity , social cohesion and assimilation all at once . 
  it 's our take on nationality and nationalism that makes that possible . 
  if americans are defined by nothing but shared values , than anyone who shares those values can be an american . 
  and appeals to those values ( in flag form or otherwise ) unite all americans . 
  it 's the key to everything that actually works about the country . 
   flag-waving , the french ? 
  i live on the border . 
  i only see flags when the national football team is playing , same as here . 
  i mean they 're probably closer than anyone in europe to our particular kind of egotistical patriotism . 
   so you know our continent better than us . 
  no , i would n't presume to . 
  every european knows your continent 's history has been full of cultural arrogance . 
  europe has always seen itself as the center of civilization . 
  i 'm just reminding you of something you already know . 
  americans are probably the world 's most arrogant nation , but europeans are probably its most arrogant continent . 
   by the way , i was n't telling you how the us is , i was telling you it 's not some sort of exceptional country with exceptional people and laws . 
  it 's just different , in some ways . 
  so is canada , mostly in the same ways and for the same reasons . 
  is that really so difficult to believe ? 
  settler colonies develop a different outlook on nationalism . 
    citizenship also requires a period of residency , but yes . 
   then , it 's not a matter of beliefs , is it ? 
  also , there are a lot more hoops than that . 
  fine , yes , you also have to actually live here and do whatever else ins requires to become a citizen . 
    except to racists and xenophobes , there 's no distinction between ` native ' americans and naturalized americans  firstly , that 's ludicrous . 
  you still label americans who happen to be black as `` african-americans '' , despite them having a tenuous link to africa at best ( or , in some cases , none at all ) and a whole lot of you guys like to engage in claiming to be irish or whatever ( by the way , that 's no different from otherkin claiming they 're tigers ) ; that 's the opposite of what you 're claiming . 
  that 's just a description of ethnic background . 
  americans come from different all continents and all backgrounds but they 're all equally american . 
    secondly , ** what makes you think that 's not the case here , you racist prick ? 
  ** i 'm aware that your country also has civic nationalism . 
  and so does france ; they pioneered it , and are the most flag-waving people in europe for the same reasons as us . 
  but belgium and france also have other things . 
  this is basically our * only * thing . 
  * `` this role often makes europe a very poor interlocutor because its mission is not to appreciate alternative views but to impose its view on the world , '' said mr. 
  * * europe also lacked the political leadership to engage more deeply in asia , he said . 
  * * `` we do not have , on the european side , political leaders who have a personal interest in and understanding of asia , '' said mr. koh . 
  leaders of global stature such as former german chancellor helmut kohl or former french president valery giscard d\u2019estaing were lacking . 
  * * he contrasted european leaders ' lack of engagement with the dynamic region to that of president obama , who had made asia a priority in relations . 
  * * as a result , the asia-europe relationship was far weaker than that between asia and the united states , said mr. 
  * he also amusingly characterized the eu-us relationship as love/hate . 
  some eu countries are better at this than others , of course . 
   i have better things to do than talk about american patriotism . 
  how many times have you posted in / r/shitamericanssay since saying this ? 
    i 'm sorry , but goddammit , stop thinking you know other people 's countries better than they do . 
   the irony . 
  the fact that you think this is ironic is quite amazing . 
  you probably do n't know this , but asian countries and ambassadors actually identify this specific trait of europe - not trying to understand other cultures , treating everyone else as inferiors - [ as the main reason they have a better relationship with the united states than with the eu . 
  ] ( http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/does-europes-arrogance-blind-it-to-asia/ ) there 's nothing ironic about telling you this , even as an american . 
  europe has always had this tendency . 
   if i subscribe to the requisite beliefs , am i granted american nationality ? 
  citizenship also requires a period of residency , but yes . 
  after which , you 're considered exactly as american as anyone else . 
  except to racists and xenophobes , there 's no distinction between ` native ' americans and naturalized americans , and naturalized americans actually tend to be more patriotic than the rest . 
  ( same goes for canadians . ), 
  just like anywhere else , it 's 0 % ethnicity , 0 % beliefs , 100 % nationality . 
  and american nationality is 100 % based on beliefs .
