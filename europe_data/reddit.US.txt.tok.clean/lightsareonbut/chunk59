  i 'm sorry , but goddammit , stop thinking you know other people 's countries better than they do . 
  imagine if i was describing your culture and telling you i understood it better . 
  the sheer arrogance of what you 're doing seems to escape you . 
  in america we have [ civic nationalism , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) which is different from traditional european nationalism . 
  we have [ civil religion , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_religion ) a quasi-religious form of patriotism . 
  which is what led ( british ) political thinker g. k. chesterton to say that america was `` the only nation founded on a creed . '', 
  there 's no `` american '' ethnicity , like there is english or danish . 
  there 's only the creed . 
  which is why the creed and its symbolism have such an effect on us . 
  that 's the basis of the super-patriotism that you 're always talking about and never understand . 
  because , although you might not believe this and others will downvote me to hell for saying this , there are actually things about america that make it unusual . 
  just skim these articles , please : 1 . 
  [ empire of liberty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empire_of_liberty ) : this is n't just propaganda , it was the actual strategy developed by thomas jefferson and put in action by him as president . 
  [ manifest destiny  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manifest_destiny#20th_century ) americans for right or wrong have actually believed collectively for a very long time that their nation has an actual * purpose * to spread democracy . 
  [ american exceptionalism  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_exceptionalism ) again another idea , which many take issue with and can mean different things , but part of it is the concept of a national mission to transform the world . 
  [ monroe doctrine  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monroe_doctrine ) before americans were world police , they were western hemisphere police , and acted to support the independence of other american nations from european colonialism . 
  [ american civil religion  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_religion ) how many countries have anything like this ? 
  [ city on a hill  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/city_upon_a_hill#use_in_american_politics ) in 1630 when the first pilgrims arrived , they believed they were on a divine mission to found a society that would become a ` city upon a hill ' and serve as a ` light unto the world ' , leading to the redemption of mankind . 
  sound familiar ? 
  those ideas have always been with us in america . 
  arrogant , yes , but real and motivational forces that have been invoked by our leaders for almost 400 years now . 
  america would n't be itself if it was n't spreading democracy . 
  and yes , at times , it has n't been itself . 
  but in good times , promoting and defending democracy is something that 's basically mandated by its sense of national identity . 
  you know how some europeans like yourself use an eu flag instead of your country 's flag as your flair ? 
  you do it because you 're making an ideological statement , right ? 
  you 're displaying your commitment to the * ideals * of european unity . 
  that 's what our flag is to us . 
  it does n't represent just a country . 
  it represents our * ideals . 
  * american ( and canadian ) nationality is quasi-religious in that being one of us is based 0 % on ethnicity , and 100 % on beliefs . 
  that 's why the flag is almost like a holy symbol . 
  and it 's empty . 
  we do n't do that kind of thing . 
  though maybe we should , for a while . 
  eh , we 've been ticking along since the 1600s . 
  the problem is this damn habit we have of cooperating instead of fighting all the time . 
  i know . 
  i wish we could do it here , but all we have are southerners , canadians and mexicans . 
  * united in diversity ... * truly i can feel the enlightenment radiating from these comments . 
  i 'm sure they 're a mixture of both . 
  it 's not like we usually only have one reason for doing anything . 
  i 'm not ` picking fights ' with anyone and i do n't care if you 're convinced or not . 
  i 'm giving an * informed perspective * on something you 're talking about anyway but do n't understand , and if you still do n't get it , that 's your problem . 
  you could * say * it , yes , but do you feel it ? 
  france probably does this more than anyone else in europe , and for the same reasons , but the french flag also has other meanings to many french . 
  [ ( survey ) americans , japanese : mutual respect after 70 years ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/04/07/americans-japanese-mutual-respect-70-years-after-the-end-of-wwii/ ) everything i 've said is a straightforward fact . 
  someone who had lived in * more than one * might . 
  what i mean is , when i see it , the literal first thought i have is ` liberty/equality/etc . ', 
  the flag represents an ideology . 
  and our nationality is entirely based on ideology . 
  we 're not an ethnic nation . 
  so we 're fairly passionate about the only thing that defines us . 
  we 're also not the only north americans who do this . 
  canadians put the maple leaf on * everything . 
  the vietnamese do n't know how horrible we are ? 
  the japanese do n't know how horrible we are ? 
  the japanese national sport is baseball . 
  * baseball . 
  * we inflicted our most horrible sport on them . 
  i rest my case . 
  i meant that in general terms , but taking the specific example of flag worship , historians have [ argued ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_civil_religion#symbolism_of_the_american_flag ) that our flag does n't represent the same thing to us . 
  originally , it did . 
  it was just a symbol of our country and nothing more , and we did n't particularly care about it more than anyone else cares about their flag . 
  but then the civil war happened , and its meaning changed to represent , instead of a country , the * union * side of the country , meaning the union * cause , * freedom , equality and democracy . 
  it 's more like the eu flag in that it does n't represent a country , but an ideological commitment . 
  that 's not it . 
  india does n't need our military , but they still rate us highly . 
  china actually rates us higher than germany . 
  other parts of the world do n't have the negative attitude toward us that europeans do . 
  the thing europeans often do n't get about it is that we do n't actually do these things ( flag worship , etc ) for the same reasons your ancestors did . 
  we 're not your ancestors . 
  we 've been doing constitutional democracy since the 1600s , and have had 240 years of democracy , civil liberties and social progress under our current republic . 
  the fact that we worship flags and fascists worship flags does n't mean we 're fascists . 
  you have to look deeper to understand why these idiosyncrasies exist . 
  and cia atrocities , yes , guilty . 
  but i would suggest , without justifying or defending what the cia does , that if any other democracy were involved in a constant global struggle , it would probably find itself doing the same kinds of things . 
  you have to understand : the united states has a higher favorability rating in vietnam than it does in most european countries . 
  sometimes , it absolutely can feel like a waste to us , to try to have anything to do with them . 
  i 've lived in britain and i love your country and almost everything about it , but even i have felt this frustration sometimes . 
  and it is a particularly european thing . 
  why not go over to / r/kurdistan or / r/iraq and ask the natives whether they want our support ? 
  or / r/ukraine , / r/korea , r/taiwan , / r/israel , etc. 
  while you 're at it , you can tell them why you do n't want to support them . 
  and your name is romeneverfell . 
  i 've lived in europe and i now live in washington . 
  i 'm actually qualified to answer , but oh no , i 'm not european , so i guess i 'd better shut up . 
  your government also sent 350,000 soldiers to defend south korea and it still has 30,000 there today when no one else has any . 
  and it sent a fleet to defend taiwan when they were threatened by china , helped japan become a democracy , and is doing the same today in kurdistan and iraq , while fighting is and standing up for ukraine . 
  it 's not all about oil . 
  two things i love about this comment : 1 . 
  you 're american because your food sucks . 
  * they made us bomb libya . 
  actually , we 're pretty well liked in a lot of places . 
  for example , [ japan , ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/04/07/americans-japanese-mutual-respect-70-years-after-the-end-of-wwii/ ) [ south korea , ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/15/which-countries-dont-like-america-and-which-do/ ) taiwan , israel , iraqi kurdistan , ukraine , lithuania ... actually , pretty much anywhere there 's a democracy under threat . 
  strange . 
  really , we 're on much better terms with asia than we are with europe . 
  [ vietnam gives us a higher approval rating ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/15/which-countries-dont-like-america-and-which-do/ ) than most of europe does . 
  guess we ca n't please them all . 
  dude . . * rule , britannia !,
