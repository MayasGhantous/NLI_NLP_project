  99.999 % of the people involved in these events were chilean , but of course you absolve chileans of all blame in their own problems and shift everything onto us . 
  and this is coming from france , the nation who pulled us into vietnam and stained us forever with their colonial imperialism ? 
  the same france that was actually [ bombing syria and trying to overthrow its democracy during the un 's founding conference in san francisco ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_history_of_syria#world_war_ii_and_the_founding_of_the_un ), 
  yeah , i think that 's called terrorism , not pacifism . 
   the usa did intervene quite a bit , you know . 
  first in all of south america - that old monroe doctrine . 
  a cursory look at south american history will tell you how well that went in terms of promoting freedom \u2122 cursory looks at history cause a lot of problems . 
  the [ monroe doctrine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monroe_doctrine ) was a policy of supporting other american nations against european intervention and it actually did promote freedom , \u2122 resulting in the us helping to [ kick napoleon iii out of mexico ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_intervention_in_mexico ) and siding against spain in the spanish american wars of independence , although in practice it did n't actually do much . 
  but the monroe doctrine was explicitly limited to the americas and did n't apply elsewhere . 
   or the usa intervening in russia in 1918 during the russian civil war . 
  sure helped prevent communism . 
  that was during wwi , which wilson was sucked into after making every effort to stay neutral , and [ the point was n't to prevent communism but to enable troops to reach the western front ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_expeditionary_force_siberia ) and to keep the imperial japanese from taking advantage of the situation . 
   or the usa forcing japan to open to trade via gunboat diplomacy . 
  fair point on that one , but trade is trade . 
  i do n't need to be walked through anything , thank you . 
  for the record , the person who said , `` neutrality helps the oppressor , never the victim , '' was elie wiesel , who became an american citizen after being liberated from auschwitz in 1945 . 
  really ? 
  you 're denying that american neutralism helped enable the first sino-japanese war , the world wars , etc. ? 
  take your own advice . 
  the worst genocides in history have occurred during peace , not war . 
  how many did the soviets abd chinese communists kill ? 
  how many therefore might have lived if other countries had prevented them from coming to power ? 
  and what about our own civil war , which ended slavery ? 
  and our war of independence , which was only won with french and spanish intervention ? 
  that statement ( neutrality helps the oppressor , never the victim ) - do you know who said that ? 
  sorry , but no . 
  remember that the us was a neutral and isolationist country in 1900 , one that tried to stay out of the world wars , did n't intervene anywhere , had no alliances , refused to join the league of nations , etc. 
  if it had been as proactive and militarist as it is now , japanese imperialism , wwi and wwii , communism , fascism , etc. 
  might never have happened . 
  the us did nothing to interfere and it only made things worse . 
  what we can say with certainty based on our own history is that force * is * needed and that neutrality helps the oppressor , never the victim . 
    militaries help people . 
   perhaps , but always disproportionately to the people they hurt . 
  can you support that statement empirically ? 
  how would you even be able to guess at the number of wars and deaths prevented by military force ? 
  and even if we did , there would still be the extraterrestrial menace and the constant threat of a zombie outbreak or supernatural incursion . 
  militaries help people . 
  also , military industries like aerospace and shipbuilding are vital national interests in addition to being major economic sectors and driving forces of science and technology . 
  what could be uncanny about the delicious bread of the dead ? 
  despite what berger says , i doubt that 's actually the sole case for jurisdiction . 
  the source seems pretty dishonest . 
  example :  in a non-binding investigative report last week , lawmakers from both the socialist party and opposition conservatives said u.s. law appeared to be more punitive toward foreign firms than domestic ones . 
   although foreign firms accounted for only 30 percent of investigations opened by u.s. authorities between 1977 and 2014 under its anti-foreign bribery law , 67 percent of the amount levied in fines came from foreign companies , the report said . 
  that 's not 67 % of fines , but 67 % of * the amount * fined , which means nothing because we do n't know what they did . 
  if european banks were more likely to be fined than american banks , the report certainly would have said that . 
  going all the way back to 1977 to generate that figure also seems suspicious to me . 
   i do n't deny the legality of these fines under us laws . 
  i question , and that 's the point of the politician in the article , the jurisdiction of the us law in these cases . 
  paribas operates in the us , so naturally , us law applies to it . 
  god , the comments on that article are depressing . 
  but it just defines it as `` overconfidence in the value or importance of one 's nation . '', 
  it does n't actually address the meaning of nationalism as a political philosophy : http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nationalism/ and it 's ironic because germany is a nation state . 
  it exists on the basis of national sovereignty . 
  so it should n't exist , if nationalism is as bad as the agency for civic education says . 
  according to that wiki link :  the agency has its background in the propaganda war of world war i. 
   the initial primary focus of the activities of the re-established agency during the 1950s was to counteract communism in west germany . 
  it 's kind of ridiculous to use that as a working definition for the political philosophy that forms the ideological basis of most sovereign states in existence today . 
  https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/russian-sub-goes-undetected-in-us-waters-for-weeks-17040 no one 's complaining about it . 
  i 'm merely saying that russia does n't actually care very much about where we put our missiles . 
   separated by oceans that are controlled by american navy and island bases russian submarines are right on our coastline . 
  russian bombers patrol it from the arctic to texas . 
  we 're not separated at all . 
   what natural defense does moscow have ? 
  how far is it from moscow to the russian border at the moment ? 
  how far was it from moscow to the russian border a half century ago , the last time a nation ( hitler germany ) tried to invade it directly ? 
  [ we do n't even have an army that could invade russia . 
  ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/inside-the-pentagons-fight-over-russia-us-eastern-europe/ ) according to our own simulations , [ nato would need some luck just to defend the baltics . 
  ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/18/exclusive-the-pentagon-is-preparing-new-war-plans-for-a-baltic-battle-against-russia/ ), 
   it does n't have that anymore . 
  it does n't ? 
  russia 's cities are mostly far inland . 
  american cities are mainly on its coast , 22 kilometers from international water and airspace . 
  america is in a far more vulnerable position from russia . 
  american bombers would have to be flying over the moscow suburbs for the situation to be comparable . 
  putin does n't care about buffer zones . 
  russian nuclear missile submarines are within a few kilometers of american cities , and russian bombers are patrolling the gulf of mexico . 
  hostility with nato is for russian politics , and nothing more . 
   the one big blunder of the obama administration was to not follow through on the red line in 2012 and letting the russians step in . 
  the * one * big blunder ? 
  how 'd that iraq withdrawal go ? 
  how 'd that russian reset go ? 
  how are those crimean sanctions going ? 
  how 's that south china sea diplomacy going ? 
  how 's libya these days ? 
  how 's ttp faring , or ttip ? 
  what has obama achieved legislatively in 8 years in office ? 
  beinge littel skilledd in ye englyshe tongue , moche difficoltie was there to cawse th ' honeste tradere to understaunde ye mattere . 
  europe does n't even have to invent anything . 
  they already have a perfectly good national story , which happens to be true : a people long divided , now united in peace . 
  [ `` the war is over . 
  now there is no disith ; there is no anatoray . 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b404b29kkio&amp;list=pl6f4479f58adb39b7&amp;index=75 ) and they already have a unifying political ideology , as stated in the eu charter of fundamental rights and other documents over and over . 
  if there 's anything they lack , it 's a cult of founding fathers , but they actually do have framers and can go back through the pages of history and quote them ad nauseum . 
  is n't it likely that she sincerely believes it 's the right thing to do ? 
  development of the f-35 was actually funded by several nations , including denmark . 
  but you 're not wrong . 
  in my humble opinion , this is an argument for the eu becoming a nation . 
  it already has more money than the us or china , but it ca n't harness it as efficiently . 
  [ not enough domestic demand and r&d spending .
