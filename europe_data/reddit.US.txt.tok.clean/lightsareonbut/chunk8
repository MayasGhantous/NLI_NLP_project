  whereas in the real world , the harshest-ever sentence for hacking in the us has been five years .

   19th century ideological war napoleonic wars , the uk reform movement , the 1848 revolutions and autocratic backlash , alexander i and ii , karl marx , abraham lincoln , simon bolivar , napoleon iii 's monarchist interventions , bismarck 's republican interventions , mexican and brazilian empires , etc. 
  here 's one thing : http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/global-publics-back-u-s-on-fighting-isis-but-are-critical-of-post-911-torture/pg_15-06-18_asiapivotmap_web/ it 's looking increasingly likely that china is planning to annex taiwan within the next few years , and dod analysts are predicting that the us navy will suffer significant to heavy losses and may lose the war . 
  and then there 's the aggression in the south china sea , and kim jong-un making credible threats to kill everyone with nuclear missiles , among other concerns . 
  ideally , i would like the eu to surpass the us as a military power and be able to deter aggression ( including ours ) and keep the peace . 
  and of course major powers act according to moral obligations . 
  why did soviet leaders want to export socialism ? 
  why have american leaders sought to export liberalism ? 
  what was the whole 19th century ideological war over republicanism vs autocracy about ? 
  the wars of religion ? 
  europeans are too hard on their ancestors . 
  the colonial powers genuinely believed in their ideals . 
  problems result from failing one 's moral obligations , not from believing in them . 
  the fact that you get downvoted for saying that powerful countries have an obligation to help ensure the security of the world is a little depressing . 
   the blm movement relies more on the emotions of a few special cases - michael brown etc. 
  - than on facts and statistics to win people over . 
  sadly , this is a problem with our politics in general . 
  without naval superiority , bicycling to taiwan is as good as any other proposal . 
  what i 'm saying is that they ca n't agree because they do n't have a military . 
  and this seems to be the prevailing opinion among federalists . 
  the quote in the article is from federica mogherini , the eu 's foreign policy chief . 
   if we had no national armies ok , but as we still have all our own forces i do n't think having an eu army adds many benefits for defensive purposes an eu military has to exist before national military forces can be disbanded or reduced . 
  and one immediate benefit is talent sharing . 
  currently , estonians with interest in naval or air force careers have limited options for pursuing them . 
  and non-militaristic nations like germany are expected to do more than they want to . 
  a single military opens all doors and makes everyone equal . 
  a single military is what creates a single foreign policy . 
  if you 're building a military , you have to design it for specific applications , based on an assessment of your strategic interests ( asian pacific trade ) likely threats to them ( china ) , and the potential conflicts you foresee . 
  and that leads to alliances , economic partnerships , etc. 
  none of that happens without a military . 
  i was thinking more of clausewitz 's use of the term , though it 's not quoted there . 
  the multi-state system is only possible as long as the eu lacks a single military . 
  it 's a single military that necessitates a single commander-in-chief , a single foreign policy , a single everything . 
  states are defined by military jurisdictions , today and always . 
  [ an eu navy would be a lot more helpful . 
  ] ( http://www.todayonline.com/chinaindia/china/china-set-invade-retake-taiwan-2020-taipei ), 
  that 's why it 's necessary . 
  only by having a single military does the eu fulfill the standard definition of a state , being [ an organization posessing a monopoly on the legitimate use of force . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monopoly_on_violence ), 
   because of its role in facilitating the us war on terror , what ? 
   and because of its co-responsibility for the palestinian refugee crisis through the holocaust what ?? 
   germany has a special obligation towards the middle east wtf ? 
  maybe the author would benefit from a little brushing up on his [ syrian history . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_history_of_syria ), 
  careful , you might be in danger of defining yourself as american , using that criteria . 
  it 's a [ civic nation , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) not an [ ethnic nation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_nationalism ), 
  that 's because europe has n't been dealing with this issue for as long as we have . 
  americans/canadians/mexicans [ used ] ( http://wyblog.us/images/no-irish-need-apply-sign.jpg ) to do it that way . 
  but after everyone assimilates , intermarries and speaks the same language for generations , such distinctions cease to be all that meaningful . 
  it 's also because european nations have traditionally been [ ethnic nations , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_nationalism ) which allows ethnic and national identity to be treated as the same . 
  on our side of the ocean , we only have [ civic nations , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism ) so we have to differentiate them . 
   live with the natives and not in ghettos i do n't know if that 's possible . 
  immigrants tend to form their own communities because of the demands of immigration , especially immigration occurring on a large scale , in successive waves over generations . 
  an ethnic enclave functions as a supportive community in which new arrivals learn to adapt to their new country , its language and customs , from those who came before . 
  without them , i think it would probably be much more difficult for everyone . 
   opinions that would have seemed unthinkable a few years ago . 
  always a shock when that happens . . 
  i mean the 16 % in the article , who report feeling personally threatened . 
  16 % are n't a majority . 
  and it does n't matter if the media says there 's no threat ; if people are constantly hearing and reading about these incidents , they feel threatened . 
  and emotion is a fundamentally irrational thing . 
  ... but that 's the * wrong * belief , obviously . 
  i like the comment lamenting how `` contraception is used by the majority of child bearing age women . '', 
  she 's got at least 10 years of pregnancies left in her !, 
   and this is the most important part : there wont be any organic connection to the people that made them or are represented by them organic ( genetic ) connection does n't matter , if they have a moral connection . 
  sorry , but this is the best way i have of explaining what i mean by that :  now , it happens that we meet together once every year , sometime about the 4th of july , for some reason or other . 
  these 4th of july gatherings i suppose have their uses . 
  if you will indulge me , i will state what i suppose to be some of them . 
   we are now a mighty nation , we are thirty -- or about thirty millions of people , and we own and inhabit about one-fifteenth part of the dry land of the whole earth . 
  we run our memory back over the pages of history for about eighty-two years and we discover that we were then a very small people in point of numbers , vastly inferior to what we are now , with a vastly less extent of country , -- with vastly less of everything we deem desirable among men , -- we look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous to us and to our posterity , and we fix upon something that happened away back , as in some way or other being connected with this rise of prosperity . 
  we find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as our fathers and grandfathers ; they were iron men , they fought for the principle that they were contending for ; and we understood that by what they then did it has followed that the degree of prosperity that we now enjoy has come to us . 
  we hold this annual celebration to remind ourselves of all the good done in this process of time of how it was done and who did it , and how we are historically connected with it ; and we go from these meetings in better humor with ourselves -- we feel more attached the one to the other , and more firmly bound to the country we inhabit . 
  in every way we are better men in the age , and race , and country in which we live for these celebrations . 
  but after we have done all this we have not yet reached the whole . 
  there is something else connected with it . 
  we have besides these men -- descended by blood from our ancestors -- among us perhaps half our people who are not descendants at all of these men , they are men who have come from europe -- german , irish , french and scandinavian -- men that have come from europe themselves , or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here , finding themselves our equals in all things . 
  if they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood , they find they have none , they can not carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us , but when they look through that old declaration of independence they find that those old men say that `` we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , '' and then they feel that that moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men , that it is the father of all moral principle in them , and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood , and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that declaration , and so they are . 
  that is the electric cord in that declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together , that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world . 
  three years after lincoln gave that speech , the u.s. was in a bloody civil war over slavery , but i think the principle is sound . 
  if people have beliefs in common , genetic connections become irrelevant . 
  islam itself is probably a better example of that , but i do n't know any good islamist speeches . 
  sooner or later , we all must brexit . 
  i 'm reminding you that we never really stopped . 
  did we go somewhere ? 
  yes germans , if you 're not careful , your souls are gon na get really fucked up and you 'll end up * just like us . 
  * well , it 's probably true . 
  the difficulty in counteracting this emotional creep is in reasoning with people who are affected by it . 
  if 16 % of germans feel personally threatened , there 's no rational thing you can say that will affect them . 
  their problem is irrational and needs an irrational solution . 
  they need to feel better , but as long as they 're glued to the media that 's preying on their emotions and pushing their threat-response buttons all the time , they never will . 
  countries exporting arms to saudi arabia in the last decade include ( in no order ) : * france * germany * canada * united kingdom * sweden * russia * belgium * finland * united states * china * italy * pakistan * netherlands * turkey what these activists do n't get is that this is a market . 
  if they do n't buy your planes and missiles , they just buy your enemies ' planes and missiles . 
  and then not only do your enemies steal your money , they also steal your ` friends . ', 
  banning arms sales might make you feel morally superior but it helps no one .
