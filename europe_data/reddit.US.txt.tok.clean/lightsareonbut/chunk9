  it only makes things worse . 
  yes , sir . 
  silly asian , when will you embrace market economics ? 
  ( 26 years later ) you can stop now . 
  that is the darkness of communism . 
  we must claim it before the pan-asian cooperative beats us to it . 
  a classic never goes out of style . 
   for a common army to work you need a common foreign policy and possibly a common migration policy , and as it stands out that 's quite unlikely . 
  looking at it the other way , a single military is what catalyzes the development of a single foreign policy . 
  if you 're building a military , you have to design it for specific applications . 
  ours is designed around a large carrier-based navy for power projection and intervention . 
  your military will have to be designed based on an assessment of your strategic interests ( asian pacific trade ) and likely threats to them ( china ) , and the kinds of conflicts you can expect . 
  and that leads to [ strategic partnerships , ] ( http://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-u-s-comprehensive-partnership-where-it-s-heading-3408092.html ) trade agreements , etc. 
  if you try work all of that out first , you 'll probably never get there . 
  it 's strategic do-gooding . 
  like the anti-corruption work he helped the state department fund in ukraine . 
  fighting corruption is good , but it also means fighting yanukovych . 
  and ? 
  what do you suggest should be done ? 
  [ these people are your targets ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37093856 ), 
  is it possible he actually is suffering from mental illness ? 
   if london broke its international treaty obligations , that would jeopardize its chances of striking deals with the u.s. and china , which would see it as an untrustworthy partner [ we are known for building partnerships only with people of the highest moral standing and the utmost respect for the law . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_eyes#domestic_espionage_sharing_controversy ), 
   europe needs common army [ a navy would be quite helpful ... ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/01/china-warns-taiwan-landslide-election-victory-160117033937156.html ), 
  this was just after the 2014 revolution , which ousted the pro-russian government of ukraine . 
  but the reasons are irrelevant : it was illegal , but the fact is that crimeans are mostly ethnic russians and they strongly approve of the annexation and will never vote to rejoin ukraine . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_nationalism civic nationalism , which is the predominant type today , just asserts that democracies need a national identity in order to function . 
  it does n't necessarily make any claims about superiority or inferiority . 
  nationalism in general is just identifying yourself as a member of a larger social group , i.e. 
  nation . 
  it 's overall a very positive thing , encouraging sympathy and harmony with people outside your immediate social connections like family , tribe or town . 
  it also encourages individuals to cultivate [ civic virtues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civic_virtue ) important to the nation : for example , [ american nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_nationalism ) expects us to be religiously tolerant , which results in [ donald trump being denounced as ` un-american ' ] ( http://www.unionleader.com/presidential-hopefuls-blast-donald-trump-for-latest-muslim-comment ) for his anti-muslim positions . 
  it honestly does n't . 
  even american surveys ( gallup , etc. ), 
  consistently show that crimeans massively support the annexation . 
  the point of disguising the invasion was so that it could be done quickly and without exposing russia to retaliation . 
  the statement , `` observation * x * tells you all you need to know , '' is almost always an error . 
  that might actually work . 
  the point is to promote international peace by bringing nations together in healthy , respectful and peaceful competition . 
  emotional attachment to one 's home country is patriotism , not nationalism . 
  do n't forget fellow olympic competitors puerto rico , bahamas , us virgin islands , british virgin islands , guam , american samoa ... 
  exactly what you just said . 
  judging success by medals per capita biases the results in favor of smaller nations . 
  is n't ` getting behind your country ' automatically nationalism , or at least patriotism ? 
   obviously there 's the element of getting behind your country but that is n't motivated by nationalism . 
  are you sure it 's not ? 
  i like you . 
  that 's not happening . 
  nationalism/patriotism are basically the whole point of the olympics . 
  it 's the entire format , and the main reason anyone cares about them . 
  we just need a better way of judging success at the olympics . 
  total medals is biased , but medals per capita is also biased . 
  what are the alternatives ? 
  it was meant to be built on consensus . 
  washington and jefferson said that native americans were the intellectual equals of whites , and wanted a union in which both would live . 
  [ for a while , it looked promising . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_civilized_tribes ) but then it all went badly wrong . 
  anyway . 
  the union of the 13 colonies was built on consensus , mostly . 
  and you can say the same thing about canada , the uk , the polish-lithuanian commonwealth , kalmar union , holy roman empire , modern india , or in fact germany . 
  there are plenty such examples . 
  it 's a simulation of what will happen when the pressure building inside turkey finally exceeds the extension resistance of its outer envelope . 
  but it 's there !, 
  it mocks me !!, 
  what 's wrong with you all ? 
  do n't look at me like you ca n't hear it . 
  damn you , jamison , where is the ether ? 
   fbi and other law-inforcment-officers inform that only 3 % of the cases a gunman gets stopped in the us is by a good-guy-with a gun . 
  does the fbi actually have a method of identifying good guys ? 
  we should use that for screening law enforcement officers . 
   but the vast majority of people who are murdered in the us are murdered using firearms it 's the safest way !, 
   are americans just innately more violent and murderous , or what are we to believe ? 
  y. . yes ... ? 
  i mean , aside from the wild west mentality , 47 % of california 's population are foreign-born citizens , and most immigrate from countries with murder rates several times higher than ours . 
  so i 'd say the answer to that question is yes . 
  the pentagon has no motive to deny evidence for an imminent russian invasion . 
  if they say it 's not happening , it 's probably not . 
  http://calvertjournal.com/images/uploads/features/2016_aug/power_and_architecture_part_3/_full_width/1_2.jpg i will crack this code if it kills me . 
  * sniff * eesti is growing up . 
  their ihdi is already higher than ours . 
  such is life . 
  we 're citizens of a democracy . 
  it 's not pretty , but these are issues we 're required to have an opinion on . 
  and you can revisit the news articles from 2009 , when obama was announcing our withdrawal from iraq , and judge whose opinions were more responsible :  the final decision rested on what senior administration officials called a military calculus of `` risk management '' and `` mitigation , '' as well as on the judgment that it would be better to be known as the president who got out of iraq , even if it took too long , than the one who was in such a rush that he imperiled a safe and orderly exit . 
   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/27/ar2009022700566.html what your friends ' relatives are suffering is happening at a time when we ( americans and europeans ) are absent from iraq . 
  if we were there , could we help ? 
  if the answer is yes , then we seem to have an obvious imperative . 
  and it applies not just to the military situation , but to the humanitarian and economic situation as well . 
  to be completely honest , this pessimism over assimilation strikes me as rather anti-american . 
  our own muslim population is several times the size , and very well assimilated . 
  and we 've had far larger and more disruptive floods of poor immigrants in the past , and it 's a source of national pride today ; it 's become our national identity , e pluribus unum . 
  should n't patriotic americans with anti-refugee , anti-immigrant and/or anti-muslim views be feeling some cognitive dissonance ? 
   you 're the one characterizing it as * the * view holy christ , is that what the words * average * and * many chinese * mean ?? 
  the absurdity of this conversation . 
  and while doing this , you say shit like this :  do n't put words in my mouth  you instead set up a strawman argument to divert attention away from your inability to provide arguments  you appear to be under the impression that the unhr is akin to a menucard and you do n't defend your statement that japan and korea have n't adopted western culture ` more so than china , ' which is absurd . 
  and then the kicker :  if you 'd bothered to pay attention to what many chinese people are actually saying i 'm done . 
  you can continue arguing about your * objectively superior * mentality with yourself , since it would produce the same results . 
  i ca n't believe how obstinate you 're being . 
  denying the popularity of japanese baseball , insisting it 's just like in the netherlands ?
