  actual violent or egregious financial trust breaking felony crimes * should * take away someone 's right to vote . 
  charles manson and bernie madoff deserve no say in civil society - they simply can not be part of it again anyway . 
  also because it 's traditionally been called `` the borderland '' as the borderland * of russia * . 
  it 's interesting hearing russian speakers choose between ` v ' and ` na ' ukraina when they 're talking about goings on for the same reason - it generally points to their view of what ukraine is when they 'll talk about the conflict happening * in * or * on * the lands . 
   in georgia , us troops abandoned their vehicles and got the fuck out of dodge for fear of actually engaging russian troops . 
  yes , georgia was n't a nato country so their commanders has the option of `` shoot at uniformed russian federation troops on behalf of a non-nato nation and begin a war with russian without article 5 or international consensus , * or * leave and start funding the georgians and parts of georgia that wo n't be occupied '' . 
  romania = missile shield nato bros, 
  no , i 'm saying that were i in the position of the european consumer or import regulatory body , i 'd be much happier with pricy ukrainian products than i would be with pricy russian energy , and happy to sustain one while tolerating the other . 
  ukraine has a future if it can develop its agricultural industry , and that future is with europe . 
  russia will only prop up its present with hydrocarbons . 
  good . 
  i hope they become a massive food exporter . 
  i 'd pay a premium to eat food from my allies over buying energy from my enemies . 
  the us fulfilled its part of the bargain .

  feel bad for the first guy ; he did n't seem to have much business being over there . 
  i can respect his motives though ; seeing the nation of his parent 's invaded like that . 
  given his age , he grew up in the us during the height of the cold war . 
  probably left an impact on him , seeing the annexation go like it did . 
  fucking * of course * the asshole texan fighting for the russians is a goddamn 9/11 truther . 
  hope he catches a 54r . 
  nothing to update , the lines are drawn , there 's been no real change in anyone 's proposals . 
  same reason in the opening days of the us presidential election , there has n't been that much news about immigration either . 
  no masses of tens of thousands of kids crossing the border , no proposals from one side or another , and everyone 's pretty much made up their minds one way or another . 
  it 's going to come down to electoral contests now . 
  look at south korea in the 70s and today . 
  hell , look at japan in 1946 and today . 
  germany has a drastically aging and non-replaced population , relying on more and more immigration to make up the difference . 
  their growth is n't infinite . 
  the regional differences really only matter to internal affairs . 
  the midwest and south and coasts are pregtty different ... but i 'd hardly expect much in the way of difference between them on us foreign policy that does n't come down to the true divide , which is urban-rural mapping into liberal-conservative . 
  `` competitiveness '' is an absolutely atrocious concept yeah , it 's only a description of the ability to succeed given certain requirements for success and which drives everything from market prices to evolutionary changes in organisms based on how well consumer needs are met to how prolific in an environment a species is . 
   the only interesting metric in regards to labour is productivity `` i do n't care about how much work can be done , i just care about how much work can be done ! '', 
  nah , russia is just exploring protectionism for high volume consumer goods . 
  i want greece to do away with fyrom and start calling them `` other bulgaria '', 
   we beat argentina yeah but they 're just barely a real country , dude . 
  [ what , you mean you do n't eat this for lunch in france ? 
  ] ( http://thisiswhyyourehuge.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/2umzs.jpg ), 
  yeah , but think of all the `` asian '' food people eat . 
  same deal . 
   and colonization often happened with religious reasoning . 
  and slavery is condoned in the bible . 
  i pointed this out in what i wrote . 
  the bounty of the west is a consequence of both its religiosity and the imperialist and colonialist mindset it encouraged , with a duty of dominion over lesser racial others for their own good . 
  i 'm saying that , along with the religious ideology of productive labor and pursuit of profit ( in the vein of the protestant ethic ) , and even the impulses of the church that fed into the renaissance ( i mean , just look at what florence 's hybrid of literal church and state and trade did for its architectural culture , and what its architectural culture did for it ) are all things that built up christendom and allowed the west to create such a massive amount of wealth and societal order that it could have the luxury of guilt over profound religiosity so many centuries later . 
  to think it had no value then or now is just nuance free and petulant . 
  i mean , dude , i 'm not european * or * christian * or * white * or * particularly fond of anything historically done in the name of white european christendom to cultures and religions and ethnic groups i do identify with and * i * can see this . 
  i 'm not saying religion should get a constant pass , or that people should n't turn a critical eye to their history or present but my god does reddit jerk itself to enlightened religion trashing whenever it can . 
  ^ so did the economic forces of the industrial revolution and the west 's periodic colonization , enslavement , and dominion rule over the americas , asia , and the middle east . 
  saying that the church in its various incarnations is responsible for misery and naught else is silly - - the move from christiandom to ` the west ' is a luxury of the enlightenment and renaissance which were enabled by the church in the first place , and the horrors of the world wars cutting away a lot of apron strings in the minds of the continent . 
  the difference between what the middle east and asia and the native americas came to enjoy , and what europe and north america came to enjoy is ** precisely ** the difference between which ones had the imperial enabling and industrial ethics of the church as state and which ones did not . 
  if the battle of tours had gone the other way and islam became dominant , we 'd be having conversations in arabic or persian about how woeful mohammad was and how the poor poor carolingians were historically oppressed so we should n't be suprised they do n't integrate into our society and ca n't we just move past religion and say good riddance to it ? 
   you 're already living in a police state lol k, 
   makes europe * no * , the argument is n't that deprivation of the material means of resistance creates totalitarianism , the argument is that then should totalitarianism arise , or foreign forces seek to impose it , the people will be much less powerful than they ought be . 
   last time i check , we were not china `` hey , you just compared two things that are n't identical !, 
  what are you playing at , bub ? '', 
   last time i checked we have a lot higher levels of freedom here than in the us o rly ? 
   where you 've got an insanely paranoid population thinking that some invisible tyrannical muslim socialist president is coming to take their guns meh , no we do n't . 
  have a huge population like that * or * have a tyrannical muslim socialist in office . 
  as for wanting to ban firearms and make ownership more legally difficult on arbitrary grounds ? 
  oh for sure . 
   even if the us turned into that , your guns would do nothing anyway . 
  `` never in history have large numbers of people with firearms presented an obstacle to ruling minor political interests ! '', 
  ^ the chinese play this same semantic game except they dress it up as promotion of ' \u548c\u8c10 ' , ` harmony ' . 
  dissent , nuance , disagreement , heterogeneity of priorities - - all can be crushed by the benevolent and wiser state under the mandate to promote * harmony * and consonance . 
   to me it seems like the american distrust of government is all bark and no bite . 
  when have americans ever protested against their government in the way many europeans often do ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_athens_ ( 1946 ) http://abcnews.go.com/us/nevada-cattle-rancher-wins-range-war-federal-government/story?id=23302610 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-05/nra-backed-law-spells-out-when-indianans-may-open-fire-on-police  when the same government openly crushes your freedoms you do nothing . 
  like the tsa/nsa ? 
  yeah , people are working on the political solution to that . 
  no need to start shooting . 
   a few resistancefighters shot at a german car , after which the germans deported the entire male population of a nearby village to deathcamps . 
  sounds like more of the male population should 've had firearms  n 1944 the dutch railroad workers went on strike , the germans then decided to deny all food transports to the west of the netherlands . 
  18.000 people died because of a simple strike . 
  no , those 18,000 were starved to death because they were n't able to respond to the german denial of their food by punching bullets through the chest cavities and skulls of germans en masse without reprieve until the germans doing it were dead/not numerous enough to keep doing it . 
   that is how the germans made sure they were n't being messed with . 
  they would n't just try to kill the resistance , they would just kill random people to make sure that the point was clear . 
  again - - - the way to respond to this kind of force is to start slaughtering the people who are doing it to you , and give them the option of death or cooperation in much harsher terms . 
  that is war . 
  and the netherlands were not able to resist the germans because they simply had n't the martial preparation necessary . 
  this is the basic critique of pro-second amendment americans to european gun laws . 
  * no * ruling class should ever think that their power can be uncontested , and the people of a nation should always be able to count on their having the material means to do to their own government if it no longer serves their end , exactly what they would do to a foreign force . 
  our revolution was precisely around these grounds -- resistance against one 's own legal government and a ` foreign ' force backing it . 
  ca n't have an armed populace if you want to have stronger powers run roughshod economically over weaker ones . 
  all the power any person can have over others comes down to their ability to convince or coerce people to do what they want . 
  the first is a matter of sentiment and owned property . 
  but owned property itself depends in part on the credibility of coercive power . 
  that must be self supplied or convinced in provision , and most of what those old men can claim to have is convinced power of coercion . 
  putin is not the russian federation army anymore than he is the mvd guard posted sentry to his residency lobby . 
  his political position in russia is no more his than his residency ownership . 
   middle class these days is mostly composed of corrupted bureaucrats , cops , army officers et al. 
  that 's why the us is pressing hard with the sanctions . 
  old men in suits do n't have power , in the sum of things . 
  the world is ruled by the wills of younger men in fatigues to point their guns where they may . 
  only when there is consonance between ideology , material reward , and their consciences is there any assurance the guns wo n't point right at those old men . 
  this is the sharp lesson putin - who was once one of those young men - is going to be reminded of if he does n't cooperate .
