  you would fare very poorly in the us . 
  we are vastly more powerful than any nation that 's ever existed , precisely ** because ** our civic fascination with ourselves ( with the added bonus of being able to reinvent who we are , so that changes do n't destroy us ) [ ever since we had a stable identity and polity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manifest_destiny#era_of_continental_expansion ) , a national conception of exceptional greatness to which all individuals are meant to aspire * by merit * of being american , as a * duty * of being american has been part of our national ethos . 
  every single part of american history has this current running through it , whether its employed subversively or not , left wing or right wing , classist or not , egalitarian or not . 
  there will be nothing like this for federal europe unless there is a ` european ' language , a ` european ' nation , a ` european ' people , like there are american english speakers , american nationals , and people who call themselves ` americans ' - - independent of their views of the government of the united states . 
   they arent 28 separate governments who refuse to cooperate because of silly reasons . 
  we also specifically forbid our federal government from attempting ( though it has gained greater and greater control each decade , leading to more and more dissatisfaction and ugliness ) to be a central , supreme power in nearly all matters - - our constitution deliberately gives states great latitude in doing what they please within the bounds of constitutional protections for all americans for this reason . 
  we 're the united states of america ; not the american federal republic . 
  we also routinely have contentious election fights , because those determine the panel of people who interpret the federal constitution . 
  all of this is mostly manageable because we all speak the same language and have roughly the same underlying culture . 
   i should just give up on europe and move to the us where people are united . 
  we get along really well in the same apartment because we have separate bedrooms and bathrooms , and only share the living room , so to speak . 
   we have a single federal income tax despite the economic disparities between states like new york and mississippi . 
  each state also has its own state taxes . 
  [ we also have supra-state federal districts for our central banking system ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/federal_reserve_districts_map_-_banks_%26_branches.png ) , much like we do have [ supra-state federal districts for our judiciary ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/us_court_of_appeals_and_district_court_map.svg/2000px-us_court_of_appeals_and_district_court_map.svg.png ) . 
  furthermore , the income , and purchasing power disparity of states which , while they have their own taxes , ** do not ** have their own monetary power - - that 's reserved by the fed - - - are quite a bit less pronounced than within the eu . 
   the sort of discrimination in the us where non-whites could n't go to university and jews faced quotas , did n't exist in britain . 
  yes , i agree . 
  though [ the uk was still quite brutal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jallianwala_bagh_massacre ) abroad well after 1891 , people like gandhi could in fact go to university ; something jews and blacks were denied in the us . 
  that 's the distinction between the continent and the us ; where europe had its colonial horrors overseas , the us had slavery * here * , so where european whites were mostly not socialized to think anything negative about american blacks , american whites ( even those who simply never interacted with blacks back home ) * had * been socialized through the centuries to view blacks as lesser and to reinforce those boundaries . 
  it 's true . 
  ww2 was the beginning of the civil rights movement . 
  it set the stage for integration of public work and duty ( might have gotten started in the civil war , but blacks were literally viewed as animals by a huge part of the country then ) , because not only did necessity mean white and black soldiers serving next to one another , but the european whites they came in contact with as guests , or as occupiers , basically had * no * exposure to black people , and were never socialized to be as prejudiced as a lot of americans at the time . 
  britain in the 1940s was a nation that has enacted centuries of colonial brutality * abroad * and certainly no south asian persons , for example , present in england even as british citizens were totally free from racist treatment , but it 's not like birmingham over there was nearly as dangerous as birmingham over here . 
  a huge contingent of 18-25 year old white and black americans working together and black americans seeing what relatively equal treatment looked like made it untenable for many whites and obviously almost all blacks who were there to really have any patience for the racism back home . 
  korea and vietnam , with further and further integration of us troops did much the same . 
  the military 's [ approach to integration ] ( https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/charles-c-moskos/all-that-we-can-be/ ) beginning in the 70 's with a deliberate focus on pushing non-whites harder , not ignoring racial histories , and always setting the same standards is pretty remarkable , considering how * poorly * campuses and other institutions have fared in reducing racial acrimony . 
  i have no problem with russians , i think their history is tremendously rich , their language beautiful , etc. 
  * their political culture * however ... 
  there are definitely ways in which russia has been left out in the cold , or viewed as second class ... but politkovskaya ? 
  crimea/donbass ? 
  after a while , the bad treatment of unfair apprehensions is the justified bad treatment of disgust . 
  russians need to elect a guy that does n't respond to pro-eu sentiment with war . 
  surely that should n't be beyond the russian polity ? 
  the only thing to do is cut russia off economically , indefinitely , to make them understand that their current government 's conduct is unacceptable . 
  european nations largely wo n't even spend money on defense , though . 
  almost all of them refuse to quickly join us sanctions or make sanctions particularly severe . 
  if we ca n't count on nato member nations to show economic solidarity in the ez , or political solidarity in the eu , with bigger nations helping out smaller ones - - - and we ca n't even imagine when germany will meet 2 % * in * nato , what are we really doing ? 
  we 're just buying free meals for our friends habitually , the poorest of them are pitching in , those with plenty money are just free riding , and when it comes to how they hangout when we 're not around , the bigger ones just bully the smaller ones . 
  if the reason the entire eu did fucking nothing substantial against russia 's aggression against ukraine was because the ukrainians are n't truly european without eu membership , then what the fuck is going on with greece ? 
  with germans saying they 'd prefer not to defend poland ? 
  if they 're so dysfunctional , why protect them forever for free ? 
  you 're paranoid . 
  if you had a firearm in your home , would you use it go murder people ? 
   the type of guns that exist in switzerland are basically the same that you could buy in the usa plus some that our import restrictions make impossible to get . 
  would love an stgw . 
  57 , personally . 
  i got everything right ( lucked out on a couple ) - to me this felt more like a test of whether you 're an anglophone who reads about news , politics and history , more so than whether or not you 're capable of integration . 
  i * suppose * that the assumption is those are one and the same , but , i dunno . 
  how much better a potential citizen is someone for remembering the normans invaded in 1066 or some other factoid ? 
  they learned their lesson after the spy ring was caught in the us . 
  putin happily meeting people who had fake identities in america to conduct espionage looked pretty terrible . 
  you 're falling for a * master * troll , btw, 
  i 've tried explaining this to so many of my friends - - they do n't understand how carelessly us foreign policy statements often wound the entire national pride of russia . 
  we keep humiliating them , needling them , when we do n't even mean to , i think . 
  then again , over the last decade and how russia 's handled its former domains ... i do n't know how possible it is we can try once more to get it right . 
  the history of eastern europe can be really depressing - but it 's still so inspiring seeing people who despite so much brutality managed to retain their nation , their identity , their pride * and * wholeheartedly take on their duties in nato as best they can . 
  that estonia spends the 2 % of its gdp much larger and much wealthier nations do n't is ( ought be ) humbling . 
  i 'd like to think if the situation were reversed , the us would be able depend on them because they know how precious home is . 
  if only there were stricter permitting procedures and bans on european sports shooters favorite guns !, 
  surely * that * would stop the terrorists !, 
   when the fuck did the us last end a war . 
  ww2 , korea . 
  that 's the kind of defensive posture i want to go back to : stay out of everything , if attacked , slaughter the enemy - - and dedicate money to building sustainable , self government . 
  if you ca n't guarantee you can do those things , stay out . 
  in libya , yes , absolutely . 
  removing gadaffi was idiotic , just as removing hussein . 
  thankfully , jeb bush is gone , soon hillary clinton will be gone and the us will have a nationalist , not neoliberal economic/neoconservative defense policy . 
  imagine if the big developed and wealthy nations doing all this , especially the nato members , simply spent more on their militaries . 
  simply were in a position to , with the us , ** decisively ** end wars that threatened nato allies and interests ( like turkey ) and humanitarian conflicts brought by continued war . 
  imagine if the us could appeal to all of nato and know that it had nearly a dozen nations that could accompany it and slaughter isis , stop assad , and dedicate personnel and troops to rebuilding and aid missions . 
  those investments , had they been made over the decades and decades of prosperity enjoyed by western europe , after ww2 , and especially the cold war , would have put europe in a position to spend ultimately very little on the refugee conflict . 
  it also might have avoided what could develop in to the single biggest demographic cultural transfer in the european continent 's history which has already created social problems . 
  10 % of eu funds , now . 
  suppose that gets approved . 
  what about next year ? 
  the next ? 
  nothing about mena fertility vs european birth rates is changing . 
  there is n't lots of water treatment and electricity infrastructure magically blooming there . 
  there is n't any sign that anything but military intervention against isis will work , and there 's no sign mena refugees + opportunists have any reason to start preferring staying than trying to get to europe . 
  do you know * why * they 're homogenous ? 
  do you realize * why * they are like that ? 
  hint : it had a lot to do with the previous iteration of authoritarian rule . 
  look at how you 're including saudi arabia . 
  try applying your apology for those other nations to saudi arabia . 
  if as someone who grew up in the west , you think the only thing to say about christendom is that it had a ` backwards mentality ' then you 've already lost a massive amount of perspective , and no preservation of cathedrals will change that . 
  what a moronic reading of the 1a this author has . 
  no wonder the left is incapable of understanding why multiculturalism has failed . 
  they do n't even understand their own societies . 
  this is more normal than not . 
  the christian revival waves in the us regularly exhorted people to regular church attendance - and most people just did n't , else did it just for the socialization * then * , too . 
  the same exists in other traditions . 
  plenty of hindus , jains , and buddhists are simply culturally part of those communities , go for the weddings and ceremonies and funerals , go because it gives them access to ` their people ' and community , and do n't take it too seriously otherwise . 
  most people simply are n't devout . 
  that people no longer * specifically * identify as christian says more about the societal acceptance of saying that - - 100 years ago , someone who never went to church in england or america would say `` yes , i 'm christian '' because that 's what they were when they were baptized and their mother prayed when they were ill or whatever . 
  today , some guy who does n't go to church , also celebrates christmas , is n't about to start worshipping allah , and is otherwise a more modern version of that same guy from 100 years ago will say `` no religion '' because * now * identifying as a christian carries much more an implications of practicing and being devout . 
  though , it has n't exactly existed for all that long , either . 
  regardless of the wins afd gets on the basis of speaking truth to power and punching up on the immigration/cultural issues , they should give serious thought to the other parts of their platform so they do n't become a single issue party , and become irrelevant/have to scramble to advance their views via contests over and over again . 
  surely there 's a coherent set of values and normative views about the world related to their feelings on immigration - - that should turn into lucid policy stances sooner than later . 
  texas would actually even * more * be ` texas ' without the us , and once was ... 
   i did n't say we should n't aim to understand them .
