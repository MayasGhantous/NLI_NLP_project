  i asked , how should we react to them . 
  you should react to them by trying to understand them . 
   xenophobia is just that : an irrational fear of something . 
  irrational fears are still materially real . 
  by the way , while most people do n't * truly * have arachnophobia , they still find spiders quite unpleasant . 
  most people do n't have pet tarantulas , most people do n't tolerate having cobwebs in their home , etc. 
   after addressing the existing problems which * include * society 's demographic fears . 
   what to do with the non existing ones , born out of the above fear ? 
  i think you 'll find that your use of ` non-existent ' is * really * `` irrelevant to me '' . 
   how should ( slightly more ) rational people deal with the ( somewhat more ) irrational reasons by understanding that their circumstances alone led them to seeing the world one way , instead of another , and that they should n't affect some higher level of reason and rationality ( even with the * generous * qualified of ` slightly ' ) than other people simply because they do n't share the same concerns . 
  ** for instance : ** i am economically quite comfortable ( my working hours are another matter altogether as are my home buying prospects because i have a couple jobs and live in an expensive city , but anyways ) , so were all of my classmates at university , so are all of the people in my social circle . 
  most of us earn nearly twice the median income of people in the city in which we live , a few of us earn even more . 
  we 're all in our 20s , all of us are educated , and the jobs we hold and aspire to in the future are all cognitive work . 
  * i 'm the only one in our group who cares about illegal immigration into the us * , because i grew up in an area where most people did manual labor or service jobs - - agriculture , gas , construction , retail , etc. 
  most people * did n't * have college degrees . 
  most people * were n't * economically well off . 
  i know what they 're like - - they 're good people . 
  but they have real material and cultural anxieties about being replaced economically by illegal immigrants , by seeing what little they have taken from them by big business and politicians on the right and left who want cheaper labor and vote banks . 
  it is a worldview of ** privilege ** to not fear illegal immigration , because you know jose is never going to be interviewing to take your data analyst position or compete with you on the series 65 . 
  it would be very easy for me to simply turn a blind eye to illegal immigration , dismiss the concerns of people with a few well placed `` dey terk er jerbs !, 
  '' , dismiss the people with those concerns as small minded xenophobes , or even racists who simply ca n't appreciate other cultures , etc. 
  but i ca n't , because i know that the relevance - the immediate , material relevance - - of illegal immigration is one i am * only * circumstantially isolated from . 
  socially ? 
  what am i to think about the situation of all my highschool and elementary school friends ? 
  all the people that stayed in my small town because they * had * to ? 
  civics ? 
  what kind of an american am i if i so carelessly and so easily deprioritize the concerns of my countrymen because `` fuck you , i got mine '' ? 
  intellectually ? 
  what is there to say about my powers of reason if my ability conferred by schooling to switch jobs at will , always be able to find one , and have money in the bank to take off whenever i want is * all * it takes - - comfort , if comfort is * all * it takes , to just ignore the situation of people without comfort ? 
  how rational is someone who thinks global warming ca n't be real because it still snows during winter where they live ? 
  are you sure the right is shouting about illegal immigrants ? 
  for a decade now , mainstream news in the us has * only * used ` immigrants ' and ` immigration ' in stories , refusing to specifically use the qualifier of ` legal ' or ` illegal ' like the right wing does , and it makes the right sound insane . 
   i 'm asking this as a genuine question here : the ` good ' reasons are something that can , and should , be addressed by the non-populist parties . 
  but what about the other type ? 
  it 's not clear to me how society ( and the other parties ) should deal with those . 
  the reasons you do n't think are good are even ** more ** crucial to understand , and address , and not vilify . 
  people have their fear of the unknown reinforced when those unknowns end up constituting net negatives , or else are never apparently net positives . 
   most of them think that giving refugees asylum is the right thing to do , and that each individual should have their case tried . 
  they also pray that the numbers will be low - since they know the political cost . 
  and the reality of logistics and humanity is that `` refugees '' pass through multiple safe countries and go benefit shopping , terrorists get into europe through migrant channels , millions more than the millions who have come are still suffering abroad , even genuine syrians and lybians fleeing violence will net economic negatives , and almost all muslims from mena cultures present integration and assimilation challenges . 
    no-one is importing any people , some politicians are just more idealistic than others . 
  perhaps a little more naive , as well . 
  put it this way : who has more of a right to the swedish welfare system ? 
  a poor person who might otherwise be indigent , who was born a swede , to a swedish family , living in sweden ? 
  or someone who of similar circumstances , is n't swedish ? 
  or is living abroad ? 
  or might never be off that system ? 
  at what point is it * certain * that the obligation of the swedish government and social programs lies ** first ** to the swede and not to the non-swede ? 
   i bet most of the ` reagan ' republicans would actually prefer hillary . 
  nope . 
  reagan was also massively unpopular with the gop establishment , also a former democrat , also a tv/movie star who weirdly inserted himself into politics , also running on a populist platform of renewed american greatness , also lampooned by the media for running , etc. 
  and he picked up a * lot * of democrats who were disaffected by the overly-liberal tenure of carter , called [ reagan democrats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reagan_democrat ) and won in landslides after being doubted every step of the way . 
  oh yah the guy who says nafta is a disaster and that we should reject the tpp outright is basically an editor at the economist . 
   he 'll have to appeal to his base by killing at least a few thousand non-whites . 
  i 'm not white . 
  i 'm voting for trump . 
  figure out your terms ( `` trump is a neoliberal '' is patently stupid ) , and stop reducing all politics you do n't like to the betes noires of racism and sexism and whatever else lets you stop thinking . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-24/anti-immigrant-le-pen-finds-rising-jewish-support-in-france jewish people already are looking at the left in disbelief and voting for the right-wing . 
  http://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/01/how-marine-le-pen-is-winning-frances-gay-vote/ so are gay people . 
  hopefully they do n't puss-out like obama did . 
   but can the same be said regarding there heritage ? 
  surely the first di caprio that stepped foot off the boat was considered ` multi cultural ' and not a true american at first glance . 
  of course . 
  i would say that by 1800 ( and * certainly * after 1812 ) , the united states of america , with a massively anglo - * american * ethnic base , english speaking people who were mostly protestant had its own identity and culture . 
  the `` wasps '' , if you will . 
  but each wave of immigration that the us got ( from european cultures/religious groups/ethnicities ) all assimilated into the culture * as it existed * outside of necessarily being either white ( as per definitions of the time ) , anglo-saxon , or protestant . 
  and in fact , people 's dubiousness as non-wasps persisted for a long , long time . 
  jfk being an * irish-catholic * was seen as a negative , [ and he actually had to talk about it and assure people that he was first and foremost , an american ] ( http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=16920600 ) ( cf. 
  obama talking about race ... )  i know romanians , portuguese just about anyone of any background that have in fact , settled down and assimilated quite well in america . 
  as have indians and chinese , nigerians and persian jews ( those groups routinely being some of ** the ** wealthiest and best educated in the united states , by far ) - - - because while they are , as a rule , not white ( however far it 's been stretched ) , not anglo , not protestant , etc. 
  ( or certainly not all of those things in combination ) , and while they do , as a rule come from very conservative traditions which are n't just deeply attached to their heritage , but * endogamous * ( not a lot of indian or nigerian families tolerant of marrying `` out '' ) , they * assimilate into the culture * someone who speaks hebrew in their synagogue , farsi at home , is brown skinned and loves kebab can be the mayor of an american city and there 's no problem , no questioning of it , and no manifest controversy because ** america makes people become _ americans . _ ** ( and being an american is a latent obsession of ours , and is unconnected to race and the like - - it 's as now as artificial but * deliberate * a choice as the first british colonial subjects who became ` american citizens ' ) that 's simply not there in europe . 
  will this girl * ever * be a * swede * ? 
  will who a * swede * is have to change to fit her into it , more than she will have to change to become swedish ? 
  i do n't know for sure the answer to that , but i suspect the truth is an unpleasant one . 
   the chief executive of the nhs in england has warned that britain leaving the eu could send the economy into a `` tailspin '' that would have a damaging knock-on effect for the health service . 
  a knock-on effect - - not a structural effect , not an actual material change in how the medical service operates because of uk no longer being in the eu , and not something [ ** like this ** ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36145686 ) caused by current political decisions whilst the uk is actually part of the eu . 
  this is pure fearmongering , and a perversion of the precautionary principle . 
  there are economists [ who are * pro * - brexit ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/pro-brexit-economists-make-case-for-u-k-exit-from-eu-1461846513 ) , too , and even though i 'm not willing to go as far as [ them ] ( http://www.economistsforbrexit.co.uk/publications/ ) and say leaving the eu would be an unquestioned * boon * for the united kingdom , the finger-wagging and ominous tones from concerted media pushes to scare as many voters into compliance with a status quo that 's [ almost certainly going to be upheld anyways ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-odds-iduskcn0yc0e8 ) just like scotland choosing not to be a real country again , is totally unwarranted . 
  just let people weigh actual pros and cons , talk about political and economic priorities , without invoking doom and gloom in every instance . 
  this is like pro-brexit people saying that an in-vote means all of england becomes turkish or something . 
  [ superficial , but ... ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jdtgt.jpg ), 
   when you see a names like di blasio or di caprio or barrack obama occupying top positions in your society , you know multiculturalism has undoubtedly succeeded . 
  all of them are native english speakers , all of them occupy exactly the same anglo-american culture , none of them retain any real ethnic difference from the vast majority of americans . 
  they are monolingual , monocultural , and * somewhat * not mono-ethnic ; di blasio and di caprio both being half italian/german , barack obama being * actually * more anglo than either of them via his mother , and kenyan via his father . 
  they 're not multi-cultural - - - their culture is the american culture , their sensibilities about issues are distinctly american ( and you can get even more specific about their politics ) , their loyalties are to the us . 
  the `` undoubtable success '' of american is n't in multi-culturalism ; we have a monoculture , and a unified polity . 
  the success is that this kind of civic monoculture and nationalist spirit * transcends * race , * transcends * ethnicity , and is available to nearly anyone so long as they 're first and foremost `` american '' ( which is such a novel identity , along with not being linked to any ethnicity in particular , not even an anglo one ) . 
  that is what distinguishes us from other nations - - - not that we 've made multi * culturalism * work . 
  we have n't , and no one else has , either , unless they have along with different cultures , uniform languages and uniform races . 
  the truly closest multicultural society i can point to is * greenland * . 
   the people that arrived in america were from different backgrounds , meaning that america is indeed multicultural in the true sense of the word and then they all turned into americans - - leading to * much * eye rolling on the part of nearly everyone in western europe when americans say that they 're `` german '' or `` irish '' or whatever . 
  we 're simply not multicultural . 
  we never really were - - the anxieties that were had over the prospect of multiculturalism , [ notably benjamin franklin 's fears about the germans swarming pennsylvania ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2008/02/swarthy-germans/48324/ ) abated ( significantly so after the world wars ) when it became clear that german-americans were simply going to be americans just like anglo-americans ; that is to say , there 's no need for the [ ethnicity + [ ** hyphen ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyphenated_american ) ] any longer , and you 'll simply see people who have bratwurst recipes and a fondness for eisbock and pretzels in a kind of affectation on the one end , and people with an oma and opa who might even speak german at home on the other . 
   n sweden , i would imagine someone could collect a welfare cheque and essentially coast through life whilst continuing visiting the mosque/church , send remittances , mingle with your community , basically no reason to assimilate , there is no reason to grow . 
  ** exactly ** and this is why the distinction is so necessarily ; the material receipt of non-assimilating people in the modern west is * guaranteed * , so any pressure to otherwise become like the native population is * removed * . 
  that selection pressure is gone , and so the traits which develop in the population are n't ones that necessarily confer a survival advantage for them within the larger society ; just the ones that bring them status within `` their '' own community . 
  identical here in the states . 
  republicans never want to upset business interests who want cheap labor , democrats know illegals will vote for them/their kids will be guaranteed citizenship and vote for them forever as well . 
   the vast majority of sunnis in france are well integrated and do not share her beliefs at all . 
  do you know what would happen to them if they tried living as they do in ** any ** , majority muslim country , sunni muslim country with sharia ?
