  `` well integrated '' - because they have the same attitudes towards sex , alcohol , mixed gender seating , women 's rights , gay people , etc. 
  as french non-muslims . 
  sure . 
  have them talk about those beliefs , or practice them in yemen , or s.a. , or qatar , or uae , or syria , or lybia , or indonesia , or pakistan , or bangladesh , or afghanistan , or egypt . 
  or iran !, 
  lets get shiite and hanbalis on this too . 
  see what happens . 
   i am all for multicultural countries but why does sweden or europe in general just accept anyone even those that seem they wo n't integrate ? 
  because while multiracial societies are possible , and multi ethnic socieities are possible , and * even * , multi lingual socieities are possible , * multi cultural * societies produce split polities of dysfunction . 
  unless multi cultural societies are also monoracial/ethnic/linguistic - - ( the us 's split between white seattle residents and white mobile , alabama residents comes to mind ) there wo n't be common ground on which to blend the culture . 
  multiculturalism simply does n't work . 
  every great civilization became great because it perpetuated the best features of itself , not prioritizing * others *, 
   i 'm wondering how scandinavia will look like in 20-30 years . 
  understand that everyone in their early to mid sixties and up will be dying/dead . 
  okay , now , look at everyone 10-20 - those will be the 30 to ~ 50 y/o cohort . 
  look at everyone 20-30 - - they 'll be in the ~ 30 to ~ 60 age cohort . 
  even with the overlap ... how many kids do you think people are having ? 
  there wo n't just be a huge die-off of the current elderly , there will be a lack of rejuvenation by the never-born children of the current young . 
  certain groups * will * have lots of children , who will be provided for by the tax dollars of those without children wherever the parents fall short , and they will be raised as those groups wish . 
  yeah , jesus camp/white nationalist types constitute a minority of christians , and * actually * practicing christians constitute a minority of white people in the us , especially among anyone under the age of 40 . 
  this girl 's attitudes are ** mainstream ** sunni islam . 
  [ this is n't new for them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrxjyfl05ek ) , and that 's just regular high school kids . 
  the russians go a little bit further than [ the us ' delayed-entry-program ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzfgcxdjxxu ) , but every nation has this sort of thing . 
  military schools/cadets is big in the uk , jrotc in the us , etc. 
  an * extremely * committed and very skilled troll . 
  ... dude , we 're sorry about the 90 's just let it go . 
  sing some cetnik anthems , spray paint zivko on a building somewhere . 
  do what you have to do . 
  jk , i 'm just trolling . 
  no , all i 'm really saying is that it 's pretty apparent the russian economy is busted and that massive military spending to counter a non-threat is a waste of money . 
  it 's the best thing that could happen . 
  they ( the defense establishment and oligarchs ) know if they ever do anything truly crazy , the west will glass moscow and grind the russian people into the dirt for a century . 
  they also know they have to keep up the bluster to make their people/allies feel like it 's a * good thing * that the current people in charge are in charge , and that only solidarity and fortitude will win the day . 
  ( in real democracies , sometimes you lose power when the people have real choice over who is in the administration position , and they ca n't have that , so this is the only other option ) so , if they 're going to keep spending their wealth like fools , so much the better . 
  they 're not going to improve their education systems , they wo n't be a nicer place to live to attract foreign talent , they wo n't have money for all sorts of things - - - - they 'll bankrupt themselves , political turmoil from the inside will ruin them , and then just like yeltsin clambering onto a tank , the next set of thief-kings will run their country . 
  think of all the money spent and wealth lost and trust broken over ukraine . 
  over georgia . 
  imagine if just half of that went to developing skolkovo , or just rebuilding housing and transportation infrastructure , or offsetting tax breaks for native russian industries . 
  who hurt you ? 
   obviously this is ripe for exploitation ( especially sex slavery ) , and it 's why having totally uncontrolled borders is a bad idea . 
  at the very least , the people that run these things are able to effortlessly move across borders since they do n't even have to show id . 
  the only way this stopped in the us was due to increased border security following 9/11 . 
  * it is inhumane to have uncontrolled borders * for this reason open borders , not screening everyone who comes , and not being able to refuse people , means that you will enable sex trafficking , drug trafficking , near-slavery , and all sorts of abuse at the hands of criminals , to say nothing of the free movement of terrorists . 
   how can we get rid of this clown ? 
  is juncker an englishman ? 
  is he welsh ? 
  from ni ? 
  you get rid of him by putting the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland first , and the eu second , by voting to be british first , and european second . 
   there is literally no other rational explanation i can offer . 
  there 's no machinations where he 's just trying to goad the british people into leaving the eu because he secretly wants that . 
  plenty of pro-eu and pro-federalist eu feel * identically * to him . 
  they just do n't say it because they know better than to say it out loud . 
  he simply views the britishers as * peasants * and the united kingdom as only so much more territory for the new order that he imagines himself to be a ruler of . 
  is n't `` balkan '' typically used to describe those states which were part of yugoslavia ? 
  does romania count as balkan , or does greece ? 
  what 's the cultural area ? 
  it 's just the * middle * of the peninsula , right ? 
  there are still too many western nations who are n't doing jack shit even though they have plenty of cash . 
  sure , but the us and uk in dollar amounts of `` value '' that external debt obligations have are leading the pack . 
  then again , i think what we really want is lack of growth on top of massive debts , along with small economic size and poor cashflow in tax revenues , so that not only are there debt obligations , there 's basically no way for the economy to become robust enough to begin paying anything off , or even grow so that there 's less ballooning debt . 
   there 's effectively a gagging order preventing media investigating the role of changing demographics with the higher levels of prison violence ( not that the bbc would report on this relationship anyway ) , which has been a point of concern for the current government , and which has really leapt to the fore in recent weeks http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-28939089  ## rotherham child abuse scandal : 1,400 children exploited , report finds  the inquiry team noted fears among council staff of being labelled `` racist '' if they focused on victims ' descriptions of the majority of abusers as `` asian '' men . 
   professor alexis jay , who wrote the latest report , said there had been `` blatant '' collective failures by the council 's leadership , senior managers had `` underplayed '' the scale of the problem and south yorkshire police had failed to prioritise the issue . 
   the inquiry team found examples of `` children who had been doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight , threatened with guns , made to witness brutally violent rapes and threatened they would be next if they told anyone '' . 
   the report found : `` several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought as racist ; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so . '', 
   it lays out how rotherham council and the police knew about the level of child sexual exploitation in the town , but did n't do anything about it . 
   ** the report estimates 1,400 children were sexually exploited over 16 years , with one young person telling the report 's author that gang rape was a usual part of growing up in rotherham . 
  ** rotherham was just * one * case .

  * that * is the level of absurdity we 've gotten to . 
  there will be no justice for this man who was beaten up , not while no one is willing to admit that the mass importation of muslim people from mena cultures is a bad idea ** because ** they are muslim people from mena cultures , not any other factor . 
  plenty of poor immigrants to the west * do n't * fucking blow things up , collude to commit nearly decades long thousands numbered rape gangs , and otherwise constitute a net financial and social negative . 
  it 's because they 're muslims from mena cultures . 
  full stop . 
  it 's a bad idea to import them by immigration/refugee channels in huge numbers . 
  full stop . 
  those two sentences , as an explanation for priors and implication of future action , from what is clear evidence and a political history in the west , until they are no longer cause for people to screech about racism and bigotry and silence/fire/defame anyone saying them , are the shibboleth/litmus test for whether or not the west is currently `` fucking retarded '' or `` possibly in a position to continue improving as a society '', 
  those laws are looser than us federal + many additional state laws on civilian machine gun ownership . 
  i do n't want sweden in nato unless 2 % of gdp or a certain threshold of mobilization ready hardware on a timetable for their economy is a mandatory minimum for membership for all states , past and present . 
  dude , apparently germans would fucking ignore * poland * being attacked , and that 's in nato where they 've already suckered us into spending all the money . 
  and how many illegal immigrant mexicans are there in spain ? 
   seriously though , you must some sort of an idiot if you are replaced by an idiot . 
  so long as the decrease in cost per employee puts an employer further ahead than the decrease in production , a lot of them will always view employment itself primarily as a cost center . 
   that 's a good start but also have more affordable childcare facilities and better fertility treatments . 
  you 'd be surprised how many people out there , especially those at a later age , want to have children but ca n't because of fertility problems . 
  this is definitely an issue , but it 's not one that can really be resolved that way . 
  even if fertility treatments advance , having your first kid at 35 and being 55 years old when they 're 20 ( and being 45 chasing your 10 year old around ) , is pretty much going to mean you only have the one kid . 
  western societies have made youth into such a commoditized period of life , that getting married and having kids is seen as a death of sorts , and to be put off and put off . 
  i 'd rather see money directed towards more vacation time , more parental leave , along with more childcare facilities ( commingled with senior-citizen/hospice care so the little kids and old folks can hang out with each other ) . 
  that way , young people could still build families while they 're young , and have the financial and time costs defrayed . 
  it 's astonishing . 
  tax the native people , make them unable to afford having children , panic about there not being enough laborers and consumers , import uneducated unemployable people who the natives subsidize to have children . 
  because it would be so hard to just spend 93 billion on tax cuts for having kids in a marriage , on day care , on more maternity leave , on new housing developments , etc. 
  almost guaranteed she wins reelection . 
  their voting system simply does n't allow any scenario where she can lose ( i could see her falling in popularitywithin cdu , though ) , let alone where afd magically installs petry , body unless there are huge swings in favorability of afd , and coalitions as they stand get broken and reformed in afd 's favor . 
  and we 're to believe that they do n't choose opinions based on their estimation of how much merit the opinion has ? 
  it 's effectively a guest editorial , with the editors choosing and approving the author and the writing because they believe that person 's advocacy carries weight . 
  i 'm the same way . 
  short and sweet pdas , gay or straight , whatever - it 's cute . 
  heartwarming . 
  encourageable , even !,
