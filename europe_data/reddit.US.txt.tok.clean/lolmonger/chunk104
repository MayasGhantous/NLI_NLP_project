  i 've only been to bucharest - missed out on a chance to go to targoviste but looks beautiful . 
  i actually hope us immigration and visa/tourism issues can prioritize southeast asia and eastern europe in the future . 
  we have to control our entry and exit and get our house in order for now . 
  so many educated english speaking young people ... 
   the issue there is that the number already in the us illegally is too large to deal with in any other way . 
  nope . 
  we just have to stop giving them drivers licenses , in state tuition to public universities , scholarships , hiring allowances , housing , etc on the public dime or in contravention of own laws . 
  once we finally stop the sanctuary cities and the like , we 'll see a lot of them leave . 
  also , we need to start deporting people en masse and secure our border territorial integrity , economic security , and making sure our social programs of education and health primarily serve americans is not `` too expensive '' . 
  it is ** the ** responsibility of government . 
    the sensible solution would be to give those currently in the us a path to citizenship then be more harsh on new arrivals . 
  plus create legal ways for this obviously needed labour to travel over seasonally . 
  the democrats got this in 1965 with an immigration bill ( which replaced the bracero program , a seasonal work program ) and then an amnesty for illegal immigrants in 1986 , promising they 'd cooperate in securing the border . 
  we only had more amnesties afterwards . 
  there can be no more amnesty , and no more immigration of low skilled people who are n't easily assimilable . 
  we need to stop up the holes in the boat , and we need to start bailing out water . 
  you should n't be , this is a nationalist position . 
  i know , we should tighten up rules for pakistani and somali dual citizens , asap . 
  enough have been literal terrorists here already ... look , basically , for internal travel in the eu/schengen , you guys can view yourselves as identical . 
  * we do n't * because we 're a singular nation with a singular language and citizenship and we look on europe as heterogeneous . 
  in the same way canadians and their border with us , does n't present the same kind of illegal entry/visa overstay/illegal work risk to the us that mexico , its border , and its nationals do , middle aged employed people from france are simply different from young underemployed people from bucharest or targoviste or whatever . 
  the population of americans who come to europe ? 
  how many of them do you think are planning on living illegally in europe ? 
  illegally working under the table ? 
  the us if anything , needs vastly stricter immigration/visa/travel laws for security and economic integrity . 
  maybe you think the political and social bargains brussels has made are ones we should accept , but some of us do n't even think d.c. 's notions about how the country should be run are acceptable . 
  contrast this with the logic of half our political sector , where having illegally come to the us means you deserve citizenship . 
   also , is n't the definition of a cabal a group of people working in secret ? 
  as far as i can tell , these people are n't really working in secret at all davos and the tpp negotiations are opaque enough that i feel they inherently want to exclude and deceive the people . 
  because immigration and the mass importation of a demographically younger people is also something they want , and negotiate on the basis of international agreement instead of popular national agreement . 
  peter sutherland of the eu and jeb bush et al. 
  of the us say exactly the same things . 
    he told the house of lords committee migration was a `` crucial dynamic for economic growth '' in some eu nations `` however difficult it may be to explain this to the citizens of those states '' . 
    he told the committee : `` the united states , or australia and new zealand , are migrant societies and therefore they accommodate more readily those from other backgrounds than we do ourselves , who still nurse a sense of our homogeneity and difference from others . 
    `` and that 's precisely what the european union , in my view , should be doing its best to undermine . '', 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395 he has his fingers in the trade pie , too : http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/peter-sutherland-the-brexiteers-magical-thinking-on-global-trade-1.2592486, 
   i mean a lot of these `` free trade '' deals are about anything except free trade . 
  even the negotiators often admit the same after the deals have been signed . 
  they are often vehicles to harmonise laws across regions and doing it in a supranational way . 
  it 's so disgusting . 
  the rootless , internationalist cabal also has a unified media message on mass latin american immigration into the us as it does mass mena immigration into europe . 
  * ____________________ ____________________ they know that they can not any longer just fool the people with left-right wedge issues . 
  too many people in america and in european nations have moved into the country or city , the regions where their local governance is as they prefer . 
  so now they have to warp who we are , and once again cause incoherence and divided trust among the people in order to control us . 
   but how it affects farmers , the market and production process right , and that 's something the citizens of a country should decide the rules and boundaries for , and then their politicians should implement that , or have it done through a representative lawmaking process . 
  stuff like the tpp means * no * voting nationals are involved , and instead , their lawmakers consult primarily with corporate interests and politicians from * other * countries . 
  this is what i have a problem with . 
   you choose not to live with , befriend , date or marry muslims despite so many of them being around , so why do you want even more to come ? 
  when you have no interaction with the negative consequences of a choice , promised positives whose public adoption comes with social plaudits and validated in-group membership are more than enough to make you adopt that choice . 
  gmos are n't unsafe - - but european produce quality is n't the reason the ttp is an abomination . 
  the total lack of transparency as national governments more beholden to sweetening deals for rootless profit seeking firms , creating a governing structure where the representatives of german people and the representatives of american people principally work for the benefit of neither german nor american people , but the stakeholders in these firms , is the fundamental issue . 
  globalism is the yoke made to fit two cattle , because the cart driver found it easier than taking a hold of two different reins . 
  both of those unemployment rates are almost certainly higher , but the us more so , where long term unemployed are not included in statistics . 
   if you think you can defeat the federal government with your peashooters you are beyond retarded . 
  your arms change nothing . 
  our first revolution was a success because the security forces of the crown here in america , the colonial militias , largely splintered along lines of solidarity to their own people . 
  if you 're under the impression that a future tyranny in america will succeed because of a cohort of us troops who are more willing to shoot at american citizens than a cabal of dictatorial politicians , you are sorely mistaken . 
  the point of the 2a is to make the broad and unjust use of deadly force against the population as a means of control * inherently * risky for * everyone * in government . 
  there were no more than 2.5 million people in the colonies when the revolution happened . 
  go ahead - - work out for yourself what percentage of regular militia + colonists took up arms . 
  good thing they disarmed you all , huh ? 
  illegal ones , sure . 
  loooool k, 
  yes , it is , and presumably the justification is public safety and accountability . 
  whether that flies is up to the danes . 
   the us submarine was entering spanish territorial waters . 
   the uss florida is no longer a ballistic missile submarine , it is now a guided missile submarine , and yes that enormous sub could blast either of those patrol boats to dust with the 100 + tomahawk missiles it carries or a couple of torpedoes . 
  but it could n't annihilate an entire city . 
  pffff , what a bummer . 
  my ego demanded that i let you know that i knew , lol, 
   you are ignoring the house of representatives , because they can pass whatever they like , but the senate is the smaller body , and the more senior body whose members have longer tenure , and it controls not only what legislation ( which is generated in * great * volume by the house ) will actually end up going to the presidency as the legislative bottleneck , it 's also the federal legislature which determines treaty ascension ( by voting on ratification approval ) , and appointments to the federal legislature . 
  in all of these massively important activities involving domestic policy , foreign policy , and internal checks on the executive , the senate is ** the ** federal legislative body . 
  ... and wyoming , with * maybe * 600,000 people by the end of the next decade has * just as much say * as california with 40 million people . 
  that is a situation which would be * totally * different from the experience of the eu at the moment , or indeed * any * of the nations in it when it comes to having unitary policy with other ( no longer ! ), 
  sovereign nations . 
  _________________ i think it should 've been totally obvious in my comment that i 'm * very * much aware of us civics and the point of a bicameral legislature . 
  ... so we have to interpret an official statement about political asylum in the eu by estimating whether or not the bureaucrats are book readers or show watchers ? 
  the european union/steel and coal commission was always sold as a trade union to encourage peace among the sovereign nations of europe through common policy - not a superstate which would supplant their nations with unitary rule . 
  but , let 's say you want a united states of europe . 
  in the us , california , with some 39 million people ( trololol and half are mexicans trolololol ) has ** no more say in federal law making ** than any other state . 
  not more than texas , the largest deeply conservative state counterbalancing its vastly more liberal electorate , and not new hampshire , not south dakota , not nebraska , etc. 
  not even having one million people . 
  all states get two senators , and the senate is the supreme body of the federal lawmaking apparatus . 
  in the us , there is a constitution , ratified by all founding states , which outlines limits on federal and state power , granting great latitude to the internal affairs of each state , while the federal government is supreme . 
  in the us , that same constitution specifies inalienable rights of the american people as federal citizens , which no state , * nor * the federal government , can override , as judged by a series of federal courts . 
  in the us , monetary and fiscal policy governing the dollar are set by the federal treasury , and the private bank-public policy apparatus of the us federal reserve . 
  states do not determine their own policies , currencies , and have no guarantees of bailouts if their budgets are stupid . 
  there is ** no ** constituent state sovereignty , despite the massive latitude in internal lawmaking . 
  each state is wholly subordinate to the federal government , including its borders and national guard ( formerly official state militias ) , the guard being open to federalization and incorporation into the defense department at any time by order of the president , who is both the chief executive/commander in chief as well as the head of state . 
  is europe prepared for that ? 
  for there to be a frenchman ordering british troops around with just as much authority as an hawaiian born man commanding troops born in pennsylvania and new jersey ? 
  for there to be just as much voting power on economic and financial matters concerning the ecb/ez on the part of greece as there is germany ? 
  for it to be as easy for romanians to go to ireland to live and work as it is for montanans to go to new york ? 
  \\  implying it 's a bad thing to be drunk \\  implying they need a reason, 
  the recapitalization of german and french banks is definitely a positive for greece , which now has newer , easier debt terms to pay off over time than their previous outstanding debts , ** but ** the bailouts did nothing to actually help greece become a nation which can actually pay those debts . 
  it 's like being relieved of a high monthly payment on a 10 year mortgage loan , with half as much due per month on a 15 year , not 20 year mortgage . 
  you 're paying less , some investor in you is getting a worse deal than the original debt holder who is getting bailed out ... but if you * still * ca n't make even that 50 % reduced payment , how much better off are you , really ? 
  every older person who voted for their previous corrupt governments in greece should beg the forgiveness of their young people and give them everything they have , because greek youth 's futures are absolutely fucked . 
  there is something incredibly endearing and heartwarming about the visual of a us nuclear ballistic missile submarine being protected from a small spanish patrol boat by a small british patrol boat popping off flares . 
   make public that all guns are illegal from so and such date , so people have time to get rid of there guns .
