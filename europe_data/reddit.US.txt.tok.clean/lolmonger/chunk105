  no politician that wants to hold office would ever advocate for this , because the people simply do n't want that . 
  further the ` practical ' issue of :  arrest every one who has a gun . 
  is laughable ; it 's already impossible to simply `` arrest '' criminals that illegally own weapons or use weapons illegally until they make themselves known through crime . 
   or you can make it more gradually by first outlawing heavier guns , and then smaller ones . 
  and this is why legislation is opposed at every step of the way . 
  you 're not going to take guns from the american public . 
  saw the nato headquarters building post , and a few comments about who was paying for what . 
  i 'm a total noob in both analyzing and visualizing data , so if i 'm screwing up , or could be doing things better , lem me know !, 
  [ ** u.s.-nato burden sharing ** - report to the chairman , committee on armed services , house of representatives ] ( http://www.gao.gov/assets/150/149781.pdf ) , october 1990 . 
  a report as old as me !, 
  at the time , of course , the ussr was not doing too hot , german reunification was underway , and the visegr\u00e1d enlargement of nato was in the works . 
  some notes from the report :  the concept of fairness within nato dates back to 1951 when the first attempt was made to reconcile military requirements with the economic and financial resources of member countries . 
  recognition was given to the principle that no country should be called on to bear a defense burden beyond its means . 
  so , how do we determine what 's `` fair '' ? 
  gdp expenditure - - the nato goal for all partners is to spend at least 2 % of their national economy 's gross domestic product on defense [ expenditures that are agreed to meet force goals ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm ) ; so , as poland [ gets ready to join the two percent club ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/next-door-russia-poland-boosts-defense-spending-42-billion-over-ten-years-1818068 ) , we can be more or less sure they 're not going to be spending it on prettier uniforms and veterans pensions entirely . 
  but gdp is sort of an imperfect measure . 
  from the report :  dod officials stated that * it is important to recognize that the percentage of gross domestic product devoted to defense is not a perfect measure * of burden sharing and that no single measure can fully depict burden sharing efforts . 
  see ? 
  they said so . 
   the officials added that the obvious discrepancy between the u.s. share of the gross domestic product devoted to defense and the shares of many u.s. allies can be attributed in part to the u.s. historic role as a nuclear superpower ( a role that dod points out the united states would not wish its allies to take on ) , u.s. worldwide interests and responsibilities , and the `` subpar '' burden sharing of some allies . 
  dod officials also objected to the extent to which we used gross domestic spending and defense spending on a per capita basis as measures of burden sharing . 
  but , still , it 's essentially a ` good enough ' tool . 
  at least as a starting point . 
  though , is the issue . 
  when i was starting this , i was thinking that we might want to look at things like this : for how large an economy each nation has ; - how many land/sea/air vehicles and systems ? 
  for how much it spends on nato and defense ; - how many land/sea/air vehicles and systems ? 
  - what is the ratio of troop to hardware counts ? 
  - what is the ratio of troop spending to hardware spending ? 
  as it turns out , sipri , nato , imf and national militaries are all really , really , really not great at making that sort of data available , for reasons of just not telling people how much certain systems cost/or how many they have , and apparently just choosing not to bother reporting it ( even if they 're supposed to ! ), 
  also , when the greek military puts russian built kornet anti-tank rockets onto us up armored humvees , what the hell is that ? 
  an armored tank-destroyer ? 
  but it 's a humvee ... it 's not self propelled artillery ... or is it ? 
  it gets even weirder and less practical when the us gets involved . 
  is it worth talking about how many fighter jets each nation has to call on when so many nato allies are [ rolling with these into combat ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/bulgarian_air_force_mikoyan-gurevich_mig-21bis_lofting-5.jpg ) and the us [ has hundreds of these and other comparable aircraft ? 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/f-22_raptor_-_070212-f-2034c-110.jpg ) as it turns out , no one bothers doing that , least of all nato , for precisely this reason of difficulty !, 
  so , it 's back to gdp . 
  instead of bothering to just stick to gdp alone , i thought it might be good to look at gdp based on how long each economy as an autonomous polity ( because that 's what these alliances are supposed to protect , ultimately ) has been in the alliance , or at least * not * in the warsaw pact/eastern block/yugoslavia . 
  france gets a starting date of 1949 , despite de gaulle having made it be absent from the unified nuclear and strategic command in 1966 ( not rectified until 2009 ) , just like iceland - - - though it 's military contribution has basically been really conveniently located radar stations and airstrips , while germany has a ` join date ' of 1955 ; that 's the economy and technology that got added into nato from then onwards , really . 
  sources : http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_107359.htm http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_topics/20140224_140224-pr2014-028-defence-exp.pdf http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs/countries/1w?display=default http://www.sipri.org/yearbook/2014/04 http://www.osce.org/library/14087?download=true ___________________________________________________________________ [ ** so in terms of raw spending ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8hmtu98.png ) , the relative burden of nato members is obviously pretty ridiculous . 
  the us is straight up responsible for about 3/4 of the entire alliance , just in dollar amounts . 
  [ ** more interesting is _ how much _ from each economy gets spent on defense ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aqgkd9n.png ) - - and right away , it should be clear , that greece and estonia are really hitting above their weight . 
  i mean , when you think `` powerful european economy '' , do you think `` estonia ! '' ? 
  because you sure as shit do n't think `` greece '' . 
  * but * , it 's not like everyone showed up to the first nato conference as a free nation with a developed economy all at the same time . 
  [ ** here 's the same measure of how much from each economy is spent , relative to their time in nato ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m9jnamb.png ) [ ** and here it is with a ` better ' scale ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ug5ip8d.png ) so , two axes now , we 've just scaled up the visibility of the % gdp spending ( the relative time data is still the same ) . 
  right off the bat , you can see that plenty of later entrants to nato are really trying in a way older members simply are n't . 
  poland and estonia compared to belgium and denmark are just doing ` more ' relative to how much time they had to get ready . 
  [ ** keeping the rank ordering of join dates , and just looking at % of gdp spent , it becomes much more obvious what 's going on ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/57uthbv.png ) [ ** explicitly marked ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1vorvpd.png ) - - new entrants to nato might not always be able to meet the 2 % mark , but they * clearly * do n't follow the strategy of older entrants . 
  also , remember , that 's a rank order ; the actual join dates ( did n't scale it in terms of distance between bars on the x-axis because that would 've been terrible ) are really far apart . 
  are you even trying italy ? 
  look at romania and bulgaria !, 
  they were part of the freaking warsaw pact !, 
  money is n't everything , though [ ** you need troops to kill other troops , and occupy population centers , and force foreign politicians to behave nicely ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tprsm6e.png ) again , like spending , iceland just does n't exist on the one end , and the us is all `` ayyy lmao '' on the other . 
  but a better way to understand these numbers is * how many workers/healthy young people each nation is drawing from its labor pool * , and risking in warfare for foreign ( though allied ) nations . 
  [ and so obviously america once again is doing all the - - -- ** holy shit greece , why ? 
  ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tmncbes.png ) greece ... maybe * here * you should be a bit more like germany ... just a thought ... notice also , in both the raw troop count and percent risked for nato operations , * just how * ** crucial ** a forward located nation like turkey is , next to russia and the middle east . 
  explains a lot about diplomatic relations between the west/eu and a not-so-western regime , does n't it ? 
  alright , and now let 's look at [ who committed how many troops based on when they were joining the alliance ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uc7ktyx.png ) [ ** again , improving the scale like last time ** , and ranking by time ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c7dgr48.png ) , we can see that of the us through iceland ( those are the founding members ) , sure , the us is pretty much doing all the heavy lifting . 
  but look at the enlargements !, 
  [ ** just rank ordering the nations by time of entry , and looking at risked population ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/slwdopm.png ) , obviously greece and turkey are doing a whole lot . 
  but look at all the former eastern bloc people , who have * so * much to lose on the doorstep of putin ... . ... compared to the very wealthy , technologically ready , and geographically insulated germans and spaniards . 
  just , way to go . 
  way to go croatia . 
  as if the beautiful women and game of thrones film sites were n't enough . 
  last point : [ what percentage impact on the nato budget each nation has ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8rjypvw.png ) [ relative to what percentage of their economy they have to spend to get there . 
  notice something about the large western european powers relative to the later slavic and baltic entrants ? 
  it 's easy to look at the data without respect to time , and make one of those pie charts that shows estonia , yes , does have a tiny economy , and yes , romania and bulgaria * do n't * have that many people to have in their militaries ... ... but adjusted for * when * nations got a chance to contribute to nato , and looking how much they risk in terms of their population , and what kind of economic pain they have to under go , ** plenty ** of nations are likely just doing the best they can with economies that have n't been western for very long , and national histories that mean it 's not coincidental they were happy to join nato/don ' t have that many people . 
  interesting to me also are the implications for true adjustments to nato burden sharing impacting the eu . 
  maybe if greece could greatly demilitarize , turkey would n't be so butthurt . 
  maybe greece could also focus on economic improvement to pay back germany - - - and maybe the germans could start being a part of nato in the way estonia is . . 
  it seems to me that of the three large spheres of a polity ( nation , state , trans-national union , whatever you 'd like it to be ) ; defense , domestic policy ( really , internal burden sharing ) , and economy , the eu ( ez/ecb ) is showing complete dysfunction . 
  there 's no real desire among the german people/their politicians to take hard steps against russia , despite many of their fellow members of the eu ( and nato ) in the east clamoring for such measures because they bear the most risk - it seems like germany is simply content to not rock the boat too much , because they believe they stand to lose very little if they do nothing . 
  on immigration , france seems like it 's content to expel immigrants/refugees/poor - `` others '' as it pleases ( the roma ) , while sanctimoniously chastising fellow members for not bending over backwards to accommodate migrants/refugees ( like italy ) , when each of these member nations have frameworks ( like schengen , for instance ) that allow for open borders and generous benefits provision to even non-citizens . 
  on matters of currency and economy , no one needs an introduction to the current fiasco with greece . 
  what is brussels to do ? 
  what is the point of the eu/ez if it ca n't find solutions to these problems ? 
  what 's really changed for europeans with eu obligations to each other , and are their interests really so close to have such a collective identity ? 
  does this seem very different to you than past-issues the eu/ez has had to grapple with ? 
  would you as citizens of eu/ez countries be okay with direct financial assistance ( via ecb/imf , i dunno ) that did n't go to bank recapitalization or pensions for retirees/longtime beneficiaries , but were essentially direct payouts to younger greeks ? 
  they 're the ones who will still be alive in twenty to thirty years , inheriting a mess they had no hand in making , and so many of them are out of work , and basically do n't spend , so businesses ca n't hire , so younger people ca n't get employed , etc. 
  would an assistance package whose goal was to inject capital directly to consumers , who * also * happen to be those best poised to enter the workforce and restart greek industry competitiveness be out of the question ? 
  as i understand it , plenty of them are effectively dependent on their parent 's or grandparent 's pensions anyway , and the glut of older greek labor ( 40s-50s ) now working like mad actually crowds out the work they could do . 
  in the us , some of our bailouts ( particularly the toxic asset relief program ) combined with quantitative easing was meant to get banks back to the business of ensuring capital flow . 
  but many of them basically sat on that money and used it to strengthen their books . 
  i 'm not an economist - - - - i 'm a complete layman - - - - , nor do i think `` free money '' is a first choice solution , but an entire nation without working 20-30 year olds * and * without 20-30 year olds spending seems like one that simply has no road to recovery . 
  making the survival of the older crowd derive from the workforce participation and spending of the young seems like a better solution . 
  would this be acceptable , politically ? 
  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/population/gm_popgraph%202015.bmp that 's germany 's age structure , according to the cia world fact book . 
  it 's corroborated by this further in-depth report : https://www.destatis.de/en/publications/specialized/population/germanypopulation2060.pdf?__blob=publicationfile the german population was 80,219,695 on may 9 , 2011 . 
  that increased to about 81 million in 2014 . 
  just for a moment , let 's forget about all the migrants who have come over the past year , and how they may or may not have upset gender balances and population numbers . 
  let 's just consider how germany is , roughly , in terms of there being some 80 million germans . 
  the age at marriage is increasing . 
  again from the cia factbook , the average age at * first child * for a woman in german , marriage or not , is 29.2 ( 2012 est. ), 
  http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008772  we estimate that for 95 % of women by the age of 30 years only 12 % of their maximum pre-birth ngf population is present and by the age of 40 years only 3 % remains . 
  by the time a woman is about 30 years old , about 90 % of her ovarian reserve is depleted . 
  there 's a massive amount of literature pointing out that women above 30 have tremendous difficulty having any children at all , and their risk for complications/genetic disorders spikes even if they are fertile . 
  so let 's look at the cohort of german women who can have kids , today , and in the future . 
  http://i.imgur.com/yhuuyrd.png i think realistically , this is it . 
  these are the women who can have children ( at least one ) , now , and in the future , in germany .
