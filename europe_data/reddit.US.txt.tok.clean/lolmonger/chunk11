  the sharp fall in oil and gas prices is tied to economic sanctions . 
  ^ yep . 
  nor to sustain operations . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ped0ddlrnu / u/zurfer75 can translate better than i , but the guy recording is * not * happy about the ( in comparison to most us bases , * realllllly minimal * ) living conditions of the defeated georgian troops being better than how the average russian infantryman lives . 
  and that was back in 2008 !, 
  russia has plenty of wiggle room in its budget for long duration austere fighting , their martial history is simply not one which indicates they 'll give up because of budgetary problems . 
  the * real * issue is the russian middle class , upper middle class , and moneyed classes which have lost so much in their investments ' value and currency liquidity because of sanctions and the devaluing of russia 's ruble and bond market . 
  destroying the economic prospects of : 1 ) people aged 15-35 for the long term 2 ) people who live otherwise comfortable existences in cities and towns 3 ) people who were upwardly mobile because of their pay situation within russia before all this 4 ) people who had huge sums of money that was n't turned from liquid capital into foreign real-estate , but instead trusted the russian banking system is how you create massive political pressure for a country 's elite - - those are the people whose support they absolutely rely on , because outside of those categories , all you have are the poor masses of central asians/chechens/dagestanis , and the ultra rich oil magnates and officials who were already putin 's buddies , and those categories of people having the most to lose , when faced with loss , will see different leadership as presenting the most to gain . 
  nope : they 're back at it . 
  http://www.dw.com/en/germany-approves-weapons-exports-to-saudi-arabia/a-18234944 also : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-08/german-split-opens-over-blocked-sale-of-tanks-to-saudi-arabia cdu is likely going to start them back up again in earnest when it can, 
  we do n't claim we 're doing anything but getting a good deal on oil from the saudis as a matter of cooperating with them on energy/their local hegemony . 
  no american president will ever talk about shared us-saudi values or identity the way the eu will constantly talk about a `` europe '' and `` european '' priorities ( which somehow seem to leave out ukraine or georgia when it 's inconvenient ), 
  i dunno , what 's germany 's excuse for selling stuff to saudi arabia ? 
  the saudis do n't attack people we say we 're allied with or share some cultural heritage with like the constant heralding of `` european '' values and identity from the eu . 
  we 've been awake ( 1pm on the east coast !, 
  ) , we 're just watching to see which of y' all is most proud over there . 
  fundamentally , you can not have any law unless you 're willing to define what constitutes breaking it , what actions are allowed , disallowed , and what latitude is acceptable in its enforcement . 
  either you have totally open borders and there is * no * disqualifying condition or manner of entry into a nation , completely closed borders with * no * qualifying condition or manner of entry into a nation ( with deportation ) , or you have something in between . 
  the something in between has to be made as unambiguous as possible , and has to have enforcement and temperance , or it will simply inevitably slide to be closer to non admittance or complete admittance . 
  europe ( and the us 's ! ), 
  big failure is that westernity does n't seem capable any more of enforcing against the ` other ' , particularly when the power dynamic is built around exclusion to access of resources * even * if such enforcement would be meant principally to ensure the availability of those resources long term . 
  europe does n't have a problem buying energy from russia as * definitely not european , or european enough * ukrainian people are killed . 
  the us did n't win rapprochement with iran with this deal , obama sweetened foreign trade for nations he is attempting to have more forthrightly support the us-europe trade bills like tpp . 
   the us army does n't work by levying troops from each state 's milita . 
  that 's actually exactly how the us armed forces works in large scale deployments , where special forces and regular units will be supported by the massive basic infantry and logistical complement of federalized troops from each state 's national guard branches . 
  germans in afghanistan that linked up with my buddy 's unit were rocking the g3 of yore , in all its teutonic roller lock sexiness . 
  they had g36s , but they specifically did not opt to use them . 
  nope . 
  the us contributes 75 % of the entire nato budget . 
  europe spends effectively nothing on defense , apart from a previous few members of the organization, 
  i 'm just here so i do n't get fined . 
  and turkey is the biggest non-us contributor of troops to nato , and unlike their rival greece , their economy is n't totally fucked . 
  even if eu/ez nations do n't like it , turkey is inextricably linked to the destiny of europe in a variety of ways , and their own problems and interests ( with the kurds , with russia , with arab nations as fellow muslims ) are of concern to europe as well . 
   but entering the public space should n't mean that you have to forfeit all your privacy rights no , but it does mean forfeiting a lot of them . 
   is the information about you in political , historical or criminal interest ? 
  if yes then the law does n't apply . 
  is the information purely personal ? 
  if that 's the case another person has no right to infringe on your privacy without consent . 
  i 'm willing to accept that , and i think in that sense , google could do a lot better than it is doing , and governments ought protect people so they are n't being exploited unknowingly by mass media company 's data collection . 
  but often , european legislation aimed at us tech companies is meant only to diminish their market share because of overwhelming butthurt . 
  if he 's going to criticize the basic ordering of one society based on what government they 've established as an outgrowth of their own society 's values , what * his * society has produced under such a schema of values -  representation choice -  government is incredibly relevant . 
   the whole all speech is free except yelling fire in a crowded movie theater that example , of course , being a supreme court justice trying to rationalize the censorship and persecution under treason laws of anti-draft anti-war literature written in yiddish by jewish socialists who thought it would be folly for the us to enter world war 1 censorship is simply a disgusting thing to do , motivated by government 's desire for control . 
  __________ telling google it ca n't forever hold and disseminate information about someone if they have reason to want it to be removed that does n't conflict with public right to know vital information about someone meant to be in the public trust or which impacts public safety ? 
  not quite the same . 
  multiculturalism works when an immigrant 's children feel like they can get the best of both worlds from their public culture ; the one of all their friends and the nation around them , and the one of their parents ' parents and the old world . 
  it fails when the immigrants ' child feels torn between two different worlds , and can not reconcile the two - - feeling too foreign for the public , national culture , and yet alienated from the heritage of their parents . 
  society has a role to play , parents have a role to play , and the children themselves have one extra burden along with all the others involved in growing up , in ensuring this second outcome does n't happen ; it 's a three way effort . 
  assimilation ( even before english inherited it , the latin people stopped saying * ad * simulare ) is a possibility , for certain immigrant groups of course , but plurality is as well . 
  quite obviously , there are different cultures even * within * an autochthonous people . 
  were there not , bantu would 've never been called swahili , and the entire genesis of different groups of humans as we have them today been muted . 
  i believe there must obviously be some sacrifices on the part of both the immigrant , and the nation they immigrate to , in retaining their identity - - but i believe there is mutual enrichment available as well . 
  something was lost when the portuguese brought chili peppers from the new world to india , and the indians went wild for them and it supplanted some of their native spices , but obviously much was gained . 
  the potato comes from peru - - but can we even think about the drinking culture of eastern europe without it ? 
  it is the nature of humans to change their nature , discarding what is not suitable , and adapting to what does work best . 
  that is why immigration is useful , for both the host nation and the immigrant . 
  but it has to be done carefully , just as useful reproduction ( sexual reproduction in multicellular organisms perhaps being * the * pinnacle of new patterns emerging from combinations of older ones , giving the ability to adapt complex systems to changing environments ) is done * carefully * . 
  immigration must always be designed around improving the lot of the host nation first ; the benefit to the resulting immigrant is guaranteed from this . 
  multiculturalism went wrong because the powers that be in europe and the us were serving very narrow interests with their policies , and not the broad national ones they were supposed to serve . 
  bitches ai n't shit, 
  1 ) they 're doing better than me . 
  i 'm waiting for my friend to get down from his apartment . 
  2 ) they 're probably not sweating their balls off * holy shit it got hot this week * 3 ) the eurozone crisis is being exploited by the top economic powers who know very well that by constantly refusing the mass economic aid that developing ( relatively speaking ) nations , in particular , greece , need they 'll be able to perpetuate a cycle of debt obligations that will result in creeping losses of economic sovereignty as packages of reforms usurp national lawmaking in favor of economic terms written up by the ecb in collusion with german and french banks . 
  it 's the ugliest possible way to integrate the eu , and i believe it 's going to lead to a totally untenable political situation , where stronger states dominate weaker ones . 
  it 's exactly the position the transition from the articles of confederation to the constitution sought to avoid , and widening economic differences * still * lead to a civil war in the us because of the deep disconnect over the fundamental economic engine and social ordering of the south ( slavery ) and in relation to the industrialized north . 
  i 'm not so sure a ez breakup is a good idea , but i think everyone besides societe generale and deutschebank would be well served by a bicameral system with senate ( membership representation ) and house/commons ( proportional representation ) governing the eu , and a pairing down of ecb powers . 
  it 's just ridiculous what 's happening in europe on the issues of domestic policy ( refugees/immigration ) , security ( ukraine ) and economy ( greece/germany ) - - it 's not a real union at this point . 
  5 ) fucking goddamit he wants to bring his fucking roommate fuck fuck, 
  we all learned about kaliningrad at some point when a news story about russia would show a flat-colored map of europe , and russia colored in red with that * teeny tiny * little dot out of place , and then we googled it . 
  at least , for me , during their war with georgia , that 's how it happened . 
  `` fuck is that ? 
  did cbs mess up ? 
  same deal with seeing just how far berlin was in east german territory in history books . 
  `` fuck is that ? 
  how did people get food ? 
  ... huh what 's this ` airlift ' thing in the next page ? '', 
  oxygen is a vital component of modern solid-fuel rockets , but is not the fuel of fuel-air rockets . 
  generally solid fuel rockets will have sophisticated polymers of simpler hydrocarbons , along with incredibly nitrogen-weighted crystal compounds ( hmx , for example is * usually * used as a secondary explosive , but can be found in rocket fuels as well ) , and inbuilt oxidizers that are explicitly part of the chemical compound , or which are packed around it . 
  air intake over these is absolutely a requirement of sustained combustion , but it is not the `` fuel '' in that sense . 
   wind and solar does not reduce petroleum reliance in the slightest however . 
  not * yet * . 
  the real trick will be this : making sure a large amount to most of non-military/critical industry transport is coalesced by public transport availability , and using electricity that is derived from renewable means that do n't involve co2 output . 
  basically , the commuter industry will have to go to mass transport and electric in the west . 
  you ** can not ** have a jet scramble from a runway or carrier deck , tool around in the flight envelope required for either interception , attack , or escort , or go long range at speeds required for stealth and close air , on electric . 
  not possible . 
  you * need * to have an airfed constantly exploding fuel source ; you need hydrocarbons for military flight . 
  you ** can not ** send up icbms , satellites , or smaller range missiles on electric - - they have to punch out with the force only burning hydrocarbons will deliver . 
  civilian cars and trucks , and buses and heating ** do not _ need _ ** hydrocarbons . 
  they just do n't . 
  it 's easier with hydrocarbons , but it 's not required . 
  but , the vast majority of civil application , from powering our electric lights , to heating our homes , to moving our transport , currently relies on a pipeline ( or shipped barrel ... ) of hydrocarbons . 
  we need to cut that out , and we need to cut it out so that long term , the combined militaries of the west do n't need to plan out strategic fuel reserves with as much severity as they do now , so that russians and arabs ca n't rely on our cold winters plying our more populous or our less monied members with heating costs , and so that as their export power is dwindled , their current absence ( a severe one ) of domestic productive capability lets us grip them by the balls with trade , and squeeze fucking hard with sanctions . 
  the west should have the power to sanction russian gas down to 50 dollars a barrel and then * not consume * and drop it to 40 to make the saudis rely on a burn rate of liquid currency as well . 
  the carrot of cooperation with the west should be followed with the * bludgeon * of economic devastation , and for that , we need increased energy independence . 
  i 'm not saying the west can be completely energy independent . 
  we do n't even want that - - if you 're not buying anything from someone then they 're free of you , too . 
  but the power dynamic that exists as it does now is n't ideal , and it can be made better . 
  if you 're a political progressive/leftist , i 'll throw all this out and point to the massive environmental gains for our grandchildren 's children , whatever those western societies will look like . 
  but the basic fact of the matter is that no one could do shit to russian motorized infantry and armor not only because of the prospect of their nukes , but the fact that almost every home in europe 's east , center , and parts of its west , have their heating made possible by russian hydrocarbon export . 
  why does russia have the * currency * to pay those troops , pay to fuel those trucks and tanks , pay for the funerals , buy their rations ? 
  they have it because of our dependence on their energy exports - - we should lessen that .
