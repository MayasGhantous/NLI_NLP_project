  every single greek older than 30 who was eligible to vote all these years post-junta should throw themselves at the feet of the young greeks and beg their forgiveness . 
  they may have destroyed the last 5 , 10 , 20 years of their own lives , but they 've destroyed the youthful years that should be opportunity filled for so many greeks who will come up after them . 
  decades from now , all the minimization of the holodomor these types engage in is going to sound just like the ` but crematoriums would 've produced * so much * ash if there really were so many jews killed ' - folks . 
  varies tremendously girlfriends in highschool , hookups met in a large city 's club , and long term relationships are all very differently priced . 
  if the cost of banging a good looking , disease free prostitute is less than what one would likely spend on transport , food , entertainment , and grooming in order to go from being single to hooking up with a new girl , similarly good looking and not a prostitute , yes . 
  modern times have brought that cost down for sure , but not entirely . 
   it would n't be prudent either for estonia and the two baltic countries to spend so much on defense . 
  thankfully , estonians do n't leach and are n't pussies about their defense . 
  does it seem fair to limit referendums so that there can be enough pr and short term appeasement to force a no ? 
  if there 's such a close margin for independence it 's because the rule of scotland in the union is n't so much obviously better than otherwise . 
  if you polled people for whether or not california or texas should leave , despite their exceptionalism , they 'd never be able to get it , whether you called for such a vote in the aftermath of prior voting or not . 
  if the only way your girlfriend sticks around is making sure she never sees another dude , how secure is that relationship , really ? 
  do you eat meat ? 
  you simply do n't need to in order to be healthy , and to eat well . 
  but you probably do because you enjoy it . 
  they hunt because they enjoy it . 
  it 's only different in scale , not in kind . 
  actually , factory farming is probably crueler . 
  ai n't missed a damn thing . 
   the object of counseling should n't be to dissuade any sort of person sure it should . 
  it should be to dissuade a person who is n't making a decision based on information , but purely emotional reasoning . 
   it should be to help a person come to their own deliberation ... which involves dissuading them from taking immediate action . 
  do you really want to play this semantic game ? 
   post-abortion studies overwhelmingly show that women do not , by and large , regret the decision it shows overwhelmingly that respondents to an abortion study asking them if they regretted their choice are n't those women who regretted their choice . 
   we do n't have a problem of women making a bad choice sure we do . 
  every incidence of teen pregnancy that is n't planned , but was n't coerced is a result of men and woman making bad choices . 
  i 'm not advocating for [ ** some bullshit like this ** ] ( http://www.theonion.com/video/new-law-requires-women-to-name-baby-paint-nursery--14393 ) that 's really not the mindset these laws are motivated by . 
   how do you determine the value of life ? 
  do n't try , and do n't kill it carelessly . 
  ^ this is the fundamental premise pro-life people are working from . 
  the pro-choice mentality is quite different , which is why * their * thought experiments tend to be things [ the famous violinist ] ( http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/phil160,fall02/thomson.htm ) thought experiment , because the mundanity of human life having value is n't where they 're coming from . 
   when fetuses develop their brain , when they have actual brain activity we treat them with respect . 
  when is that ? 
  30 minutes before delivery ? 
  you 're ultimately talking about something that would have to be * estimated * . 
   with advancement of science soon many thing will have the potential to become independent human lives from a single egg to every cell in your body . 
  okay , but in terms of evolution our reproduction is a natural and consequential thing . 
  if you could create life ( which , i agree , we will be able to ) by manipulating differentiated cells into a pluripotent state for implantation ( perhaps even in an artificial womb ) so that a single healthy skin cell from my arm could turn into a genetic clone of myself ( or why not , let 's say we could rearrange the whole genome entirely ) or into a novel human being ... . ... it would be at the point someone manipulated the cell into that state and began the process of reproducing human life that pro-life people would say `` holy shit , that 's a developing human , you ca n't just throw it in the lab trash now ! '', 
   do you wash hands ? 
  you killed trillions of bacterial lives . 
  does n't have the same value as human life . 
   do you eat meat ? 
  ever ate pork ? 
  you ended a life of a sentient being with feelings . 
  i would agree . 
  does n't have the same value as human life . 
   fetuses do not think , they do not feel . 
  irrelevant ; they become babies - they 're literally weeks away from being babies . 
  quintillions of bacteria can be killed ; that does n't involve killing things that are going to be independent human lives . 
   they rather think it through . 
  they obviously did n't think it through as much when they were choosing to have sex as a member of the biological gender that pays such an enormous share of the physiological and psychological cost for * both * pregnancy * and * abortion . 
  counselling post-pregnancy/pre-abortion is the same side of the coin as sex education . 
  people make better choices when they 're informed and made acutely aware of the consequences of decisions . 
  sex education ought be `` forced '' in the sense that every kid before they hit puberty * must * get it from schooling . 
  it 's simply bad policy to not `` force '' this one them . 
  same thing for pre-abortion counsel . 
  it 's easy to paint it as `` forced '' , but fundamentally , someone who really has thought things through and really does want an abortion , wo n't be dissuaded , because the object of this kind of counselling is n't to dissuade that sort of person . 
  i mean , i 'm one of those americans who wants to see birthright citizenship ended for people who do n't have at least one us citizen parent , or both parents being permanent legal residents as they are born on us soil , along with the complete cessation of public tuition , drivers licensing , healthcare and tax credits provided to illegal immigrants , with 100 % excise on businesses found guilty of employing illegals , in addition to the removal of federal funding of any kind ( even emergency disaster relief ) from any state or municipality that will not cooperate with federal law enforcement on immigration . 
  no need to deport after that ; they 'll leave and not come over all on their own . 
  but europe needs to consider some hard facts ; you either need to be totally honest like i am about what the responsibilities of government are to its own people and * not * foreign people , or really do find some kind of way to assimilate those who are here . 
  my point was only to make it clear that immigration choices have * much * less middle ground than people assume them to have . 
  britain : [ ** welcome to sarajevo ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fpvvngqa7a ) i watched it when i was 8 ( in retrospect , parents should n't have let me watch with my older brothers ) and it was how i was introduced to the conflict and the messiness of international politics . 
   i am very happy that our american brothers support us often we only learn about the marquis de la fayette or baron von steuben in history class , but this guy sadly sometimes gets overlooked : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tadeusz_ko%c5%9bciuszko then again , we also call him ` thaddeus ' , so ... 
  nothing beats [ * italian spiderman * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhhhxukovmu ), 
   i do n't believe that the spanish really ca n't say they 're about to study no , i 'm saying you ca n't use the gerund form with ando/endo for future forms . 
  you ca n't say : voy a ser estudiando despues la cena for `` i 'm going to be studying after dinner '' ; you can only use that form for something like `` estoy estudiando ( ahora ) '' i 'm studying * now * . 
   i hear phrases like ` if i were you ' and ' i wished i were x ' a lot . 
  that 's subjunctive as well right ? 
  i do n't see why it would be archaic . 
  * would * that something were true , blah blah blah , where the subjunctive is put in an absolutive * is * very archaic in modern english . 
  people just do n't talk like that anymore . 
  `` if i were you '' is much more common . 
  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:bangalore_highway.jpg ^ indian driving conditions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_highway_ ( india ) ^ other indian driving conditions indian * does * have a fuckton of slums and poor people in them , and * plenty * of awful infrastructure , but there 's good reason to buy luxury vehicles . 
  the bought 3.2 million vehicles in 2013 alone ; there are about a billion indians . 
  even if only 15 % of them have the money for a car , and only 5 % have the money for a nice luxury sedan ... well ... in an eu with a population replacement rate dropping like a stone ... do the math . 
  subjunctive use ? 
  we not only got rid of most of our different verb forms well before the modern english period , but as far as actual tone/aspect is concerned , almost * everything * about english conditionals gets captured by incredibly inconsistent and fluid use of `` could/would/should '' coupled to `` if '' . 
  hypotheticals , futures , conditionals , perfectives , etc. 
  we have an incredibly inconsistent and ambiguous system ; it 's good because it allows us a ridiculous range of nuance much , much broader than exists in other languages . 
  a classic example is english 's abuse of the gerundive : `` to study '' `` study-ing '' okay , studying is the act of what you do when you * study * . 
  sure . 
  but we can also make a present progressive out of it . 
  `` i am studying '' . 
  not saying i am the act of studying anymore ; i am currently engaged in what it means to study . 
  i am studying . 
  but you can also use it in the future : i will be studying . 
  contrast that with spanish : yo estudio espanol . 
  i * study * spanish . 
  you have to go to : estudiando ( - ando/endo is n't exactly their - ing as you 'll see in a moment ) espanol ; i am * right now * studying . 
  you could never use present progressives to imply a future in spanish like with `` we are * going * to the mall '' . 
  estar and the present participle * has * to mean the immediate present __________________________________ were i king , i should think i would be a good king . 
  that i could be king , i would be a good king . 
  should i be king , i will be a good one . 
  when i was king , i was a good one , etc. 
  modern english speakers will * often * get confused about exactly what these sort of sentences are saying if they 're not careful , in terms of the time the orator is referring to , the time of the action , the hypothetical nature of the sentence , conditions placed on its fulfillment , etc. 
  but it 's okay , because we 're able to convey a ridiculous level of differently nuanced aspects and tenses that elude totally formal description as in classical languages with strict rules of tense and clause because of it . 
  it 's totally mutt language , but for this and many reasons , it 's a gem of indo-european . 
  1 ) too religious 2 ) does n't directly invoke wartime survival 3 ) tied to our civil war history , because it was written then , not our revolutionary history . 
  1 is n't actually too big a problem , except for how christian duties often motivated our conquest of the new world and imperialism in our hemisphere . 
  2 is actually a really large problem because of how it basically undercuts the continuity of the republic if it 's chosen ; the civil war was much more about the preservation of the american republic than it was the creation of it .
