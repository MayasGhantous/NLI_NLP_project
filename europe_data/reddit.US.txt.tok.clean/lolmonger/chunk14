  3 is important because :  and the rocket 's red glare , the bombs bursting in air ,  gave proof through the night that our flag was still there . 
   oh , say does that star-spangled banner yet wave  o\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave ? 
  , speaks directly to a deeply ingrained american notion of defiant survival , in a martial and political context of upholding the hard won independence that started the nation . 
  as an anthem challenging the listener to search for proof that they still live in the land of the free and the home of the brave , and indicating the high stakes of that land 's creation ( incendiary rockets illuminating the battle flag of fort mchenry , retained by rebel forces , giving way to the colony 's flag being hoisted the morning after , unambiguously signalling the defender 's victory ) , it 's pretty much perfect for both its historical context and lyrical content . 
  `` hey look at this banner , which is our national symbol people tried killing us so we would n't have our nation and when they did , their weaponry simply shone light on it because we did n't lose is it still there ? 
  did you protect it ? 
  the banner , the land ? '', 
  , is effectively what the anthem boils down to . 
  http://abcnews.go.com/politics/obama-scraps-bush-missile-defense-plan/story?id=8604357 would 've happened sooner if not for a certain president who 's a pussy on defense . 
  same shit with us support for the kurds . 
  wo n't dedicate air support resources to them because he 's worried about upsetting the turks . 
  compared to his predecessors , he 's basically hanging them out to dry . 
  the reset failed because while hillary viewed the button pressing exercise as a good photo-op , sergei lavrov viewed it as the height of western softness . 
  hers was smiling laughter of relief and hubris . 
  his was smiling laughter of disbelief at russia 's good fortune someone on a resume-padding adventure for their presidential run was in over their heads . 
  http://www.the-american-interest.com/2014/03/01/putin-smashes-washingtons-cocoon/  but this massive intellectual breakdown has a lot to do with a common american mindset that is especially built into our intellectual and chattering classes . 
  well educated , successful and reasonably liberal minded americans find it very hard to believe that other people actually see the world in different ways . 
   they can see that vladimir putin is not a stupid man and that many of his russian officials are sophisticated and seasoned observers of the world scene . 
  american experts and academics assume that smart people everywhere must want the same things and reach the same conclusions about the way the world works . 
   how many times did foolishly confident american experts and officials come out with some variant of the phrase `` we all share a common interest in a stable and prosperous ukraine . '' we may think that 's true , * but putin does n't . 
  * and so people like clinton , people like all the talking-heads and keyboard punchers of the ` policy analysis ' world , the albright-nye types , were all left holding their dicks in their hands with their pants down when russian motorized troops and close air not only quickly annexed a paltry ukrainian resistance in crimea , but proceeded to violently take over and occupy formented rebellions with material support in eastern ukraine . 
   this is about us espionage against the german government . 
  the us is n't just spying on people who might favour russia after all . . do you believe france is n't spying on the us government ? 
  or israel beyond just relations with iran and palestine ? 
  the only possible odious thing here is german nationals being spied on by us nationals with german government consent . 
  but when that 's happening , its clearly as part of anti-russian efforts or the * very * same mass collection that the auscanzukus states all practice , which germany is becoming party to . 
  an anglo-german alliance , not just an anglophone one . 
  have a problem with mass surveillance all you like , but do n't pretend this is motivated by some us policy maker 's desire to hurt german people 's feelings . 
   now however , germany is part of a bloc that rivals the us and has interests that do n't match those of the us , only after 25 years of reunification , and people like putin still have friends like schroeder . 
  you think that merkel is just * stupid * ? 
  you think her knowledge of bnd collaboration with the cia is an * accident * ? 
  do you think putin invading crimea is just an isolated thing ? 
  the cold war did not end , and russian relationships with east germans in high positions of power did n't just vanish with the wall . 
   so german intelligence agencies should be interested , likely are in fact . 
  that does n't mean that they should be enabling a foreign power to conduct operations on their soil . . 
  unless that foreign interest is the one that rebuilt them against communism , who 've they 've been working shoulder to shoulder with from the end of the second world war through reunification , and who have capabilities and political coverage for spying on reunified politicians and business interests they do not . 
  this makes perfect goddamn sense , how are you not seeing it ? 
  why the fuck do you think germany was being made privy to five eyes intelligence as well ? 
  between the russians and the west , who do you think merkel believes germany belongs with ? 
  and who do you think she 's worried certain politicians and business magnates and government officials older than 25 years old think germany belongs with ? 
  i interpreted you incorrectly - my apologies . 
   absolutely !, 
  it should be very aware ... and given the west german history with the us and rebuilding and being the frontier against the ussr/warsaw pact from 1945 up until 1990-1994 when reunification and then eastern bloc defection started happening , you think the * cooperation * between germans and americans on spying on ` german ' politicians and business interests is an accident ? 
  look up who the head of nordstream ag is . 
  look up who his firstborn son is . 
  look up that son 's restaurant in berlin . 
  look at the long time friend and russian political figure ( a former kgb agent ) of the head of nordstream ag is ( himself a former member of the stasi ) , who goes and eats there . 
  this is the level of close relationships and professional and ideological history german has to deal with on energy and politics vis a vis russia , let alone schroeder . 
  what if half the populace and government and business interests of that ally were just 25 years ago explicitly part of your enemy 's holding and now it 's very hard to know what people from former institutions of power are really acting in your reunified interests or still operating and colluding with foreign moneyed ones ? 
  i do n't give a flying fuck if the us is spying on isis supporters , communists , capitalists , pro-russian politicians , anti-american politicians or whatever in germany , but the german government should . 
  the german government should be protecting itself and its citizens , not enabling the violation of those citizens . 
  do you think it 's impossible the german government , post reunification would n't be ** very ** interested in what kind of connections were maintained between the former soviet union and the * entire east german apparatchik * ? 
  and just * maybe * they would be complicit via the bnd in spying on german nationals potentially connected to russian energy interests because they ultimately have their own suspicions but not the same political coverage or capabilities as the cia ? 
   500.000 eur so , barely more than a million bucks ? 
  dude , that 's seed money . 
  series a funding averages , even for pre-revenue firms in sv are anywhere from 6 to 12 million . 
  that 's how they scale up in talent and output so quickly . 
  it 's entire functional companies with the resources they 'd `` have '' after they were successful * before * they are successful . 
  there 's * huge * risk in giving them any money at all , and there 's a lot of failure . 
  it 's just that the returns come out well because so many ideas get funded and the good ones generate a shit ton by offering services people want . 
  that kind of risk tolerance climate just * does n't * exist in a widespread way in europe - - it is n't even there in nyc despite their reliance on finance ; even now startups asking for money there wo n't attract as much . 
  yeah , i recognized that . 
  i just do n't think romania 's availability of domestic capital for startup funding is very good . 
  do you ? 
   i do n't think that your perceived good/bad features affect your ability to date sure it does . 
  whether or not someone is found attractive enough to fuck is directly related to perception . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   it is pretty naive to complain about ` not getting any ' and play the race card for it . 
  no it 's not it 's naive to pretend race/socialization does n't matter . 
  http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/11/30/247530095/are-you-interested-dating-odds-favor-white-men-asian-women   do n't even get me started on what it 's like being an indian/asian male trying to date indian/asian women . 
   it 's easier than trying to date indian women if you are white . 
  dude no it really is n't . 
  yo love your flair cuz, 
  not necessarily . 
  one of the landmark cases of the us supreme court on immigration anticipated this sort of thing exactly . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_v._bhagat_singh_thind ( 1923 ) guy came over here , served in the us military , became a citizen ( and had it revoked ) over and over again , finally appealed to the supreme court . 
  their logic was that : 1 ) though he was caucasian in an ethnological sense , the common person in the united states would n't understand something like the nuance of indo-aryan vs. dravidian , and would n't care - - he 's a brown guy from another country , not `` white '' in that sense , and therefore , not eligible for citizenship 2 ) furthermore :   it is a matter of familiar observation and knowledge that the physical group characteristics of the hindus render them readily distinguishable from the various groups of persons in this country commonly recognized as white . 
  the * children of english , french , german , italian , scandinavian , and other european parentage , quickly merge into the mass of our population and lose the distinctive hallmarks of their european origin * . 
  on the other hand , * it can not be doubted that the children born in this country of hindu parents would retain indefinitely the clear evidence of their ancestry * . 
   * it is very far from our thought to suggest the slightest question of racial superiority or inferiority . 
  * what we suggest is merely * racial difference * , and it is of * such character and extent that the great body of our people instinctively recognize it and reject the thought of assimilation * .

  i dated a girl from the czech republic in college . 
  guess who people on the street thought was dating an international student ? 
  race * does * matter for assimilation , and part of it ** is ** tied up with who you 'll be able to date and reproduce with eventually . 
  for instance : it was always * really * hard for me to get a date in highschool , despite the fact i was born and raised in the same community as everyone else . 
  much , much easier in college , * particularly * with girls who were from non-anglophone countries that did n't have a lot of indian immigrants in them . 
  effectively , i was a racial unknown , but i was not a known racial `` other '' . 
  do n't even get me started on what it 's like being an indian/asian male trying to date indian/asian women . 
  i 'm sure if she and i got married and had kids , the offspring of that union , having a slightly lighter skin tone than myself , would deal with * far * fewer racist comments , and have an easier time than i did dating , and be less readily assumed to not be american . 
  that 's just how it is . 
  it 's not a crazy concern for op to have , though their phrasing may have been clunky , and their notions about what constitutes `` good '' immigrants off the mark from those features that actually encourage assimilation . 
   ( founder of skype ) [ ** k ** ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-13343600 ) europe simply does n't have the regulatory ( or * lack of it * ) framework required for venture capital operations to work with startups in the way technological services outfits require . 
  skype is the exception that proves the rule , and frankly , estonia is very different from other european nations .
