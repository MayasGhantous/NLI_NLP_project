  they have money ( not a lot , but their economy is developed ) they have a high standard of living when it comes to connectivity and prolific internet use ( romania does too , but they 're * very * capital short ) , and they have a small but highly educated populace . 
  it by itself , * is * a lot like silicon valley ... . . but without the order of magnitude of funding that exists in the us . 
  as for the rest of europe , there is neither the capital , nor the risk culture , that exists in silicon valley , and in many cases , not the talent , either . 
  it 's not just india and china that have constantly been sending their best to the us coasts , for education , work , and family raising .

  this same argument applies , to a lesser extent , to nyc as it attempts to compete with the bay area . 
  its money is tied up into financial industry interests , and it 's just not a place startups can network right now .

  if an apartment building across the street from yours is on fire , the worst solution is to let people burn to death inside it . 
  the next best solution is to let them come live in your building forever . 
  the next best solution is for them to live in your building while you help them put the fire out and rebuild so they can move back . 
  the best solution is for them to be capable of putting the fire out themselves . 
  if your worth is n't a result of production , but ease of capital flow , you 're going to be susceptible to contractions of available credit . 
  someone with excellent cashflow from income and investments can have a lot of debts have a high worth . 
  someone with poor cashflow from loans who takes on debt can also have a high worth , even a higher one than the former . 
  but the latter is * fucked * if debt is called in , or credit becomes unavailable . 
  all pull and no push leaves you drowning in debt if the credit cable is cut . 
  the german economy has its own propellers ; the greek economy * did not * . 
  this is n't so different from why different firms failed or continued to succeed despite setbacks after 2008 in the us . 
  brokerage firms whose * entire * product model was reliant on the consumer trust in credit services to finance mortgages and the like got * fucked * . 
  firms which sold * things * they produced or had contracted to produced that they sold ; smartphones or fast food or whatever , got * kind of fucked * . 
  and then they kept going . 
  `` living in a majority white area with abundant economic wealth and opportunity as a result of historically unsavory actions and amoral financial practice ruined me for any lesser standard of comforts or personal ease '' the author might as well be one of those people who decides nyc is too smelly and loud and finds a nice quiet home with a solarium and drawing room for their family in connecticut .

  canada does n't have nearly the immigration problem the us does , and sentiments in the us range from wanting total deportation to outright sanctuary cities where cooperation with federal law enforcement on immigration of any kind is prohibited . 
  if you told a woman that it was her fault for not using condoms or birth control if she conceived a child she did n't want ( in the same circumstances where a man who had n't insisted on having sex only after a woman had taken bc pills or using a condom himself , also wanted to avoid responsibility ) you would be socially crucified . 
  it 's not like `` hey , condoms prevent unwanted babies ! '', 
  that gets you in trouble . 
  it 's * any * linking of sexual responsibility to women in the us that gets called ` slut shaming ' when the same is done to men , particularly when men want to legally avoid the problems of unplanned reproduction but pursue sex that women want to as well . 
  not in america ; that kind of statement would get you into massive trouble even if you were n't a public figure , in almost any university or workplace setting in the coasts , while the opposite sentiment is assumed as a fait accompli when any discussions turn to reproductive policy or norms , even casually . 
   seriously : if you do n't want to pay , use a fucking condom or get a vasectomy . 
  do n't expect society to pick up the tab because you could n't be bothered to care about contraceptives . 
  okay , why do n't we tell this to women , too ? 
  * woah woah woah , but that would be sexist slut shaming !!,

   politics will continue to swing to the right futher or , they 'll start having kids here who continue on in separated ethnic and linguistic enclaves and certain political sectors will understand that they can have certain voting districts ( and even certain elections ) on complete lockdown by giving the national coffers to people from abroad , and politics * will not be able to shift right * . 
   what is the solution ? 
  stop voting for politicians whose policy choices on your behalf involve being lax on immigration/refugee seekers . 
  i mean , or bury your head in the sand . 
   i 'm honestly kind of tired of the council running europe and deciding it 's future . 
  only 3 countries matter , one does n't give a damn and thinks dividing europe is the best option , one is obsessed with austerity and the other has trouble adapting to modern times . 
  i can vote whatever i want , it does n't do a single thing about how europe is heading . 
  sounds like there ought be some ` upper ' house that must assent to ` lower house ' legislation on the basis of each member state having equal representation in final decision making so as to not give all power to the numerous and wealthy .

  dominos actually had this huge campaign ( they are kind of keeping it going ) where they explicitly acknowledged their pizza was garbage , and they would strive to make it better . 
  also , they kind of did , and from 2010 their share price climbed significantly . 
  so , as a dane , you 're * not * going to be inviting as many people from impoverished countries to live in your home while you feed and clothe them , or hope for them to have that provided by denmark 's social systems , correct ? 
   every deportation is a life destroyed . 
  what about illegal entries refused ? 
  sounds like your country has room for several hundred million of the poorest africans , indian , chinese , and latin americans combined to be housed , fed , clothes , and given access to public services .

   there is no desire to be `` the last best hope of earth '' . 
  we do n't have a desire to be that . 
  we have a desire to stay that way . 
  american optimism has been replaced by worry , but only because we 're now indisputably on top and have challengers . 
  the opposite is true , too , sadly . 
  it 's all very strange to us in the us ; our history really just does n't go back beyond a few centuries , and the nation we won our independence from , almost immediately after the conflicts , became a mutually respected and fond ally . 
  besides the canadians ( and really , they 're effectively viewed as americans with a different color scheme ) , there 's really nowhere else the us cares for more than the uk . 
  long running hostilities on ethnic grounds just are n't something we can wrap our heads around intuitively as a nation , but i get some of it because of where my parents came from . 
   if you compare the us modern foreign policy to what they were doing hawaii is a us state because of a conspiracy between fruit industry magnates and several members of the united states military and senate to overthrow the sovereign kingdom of hawaii and create a political emergency whose resolution would be the islands ' annexation by the united states . 
  not exactly the only pie we 've stuck our fingers in , either : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippines#american_period https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puerto_rico#united_states_colony https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_cuba_ ( 1902 % e2 % 80 % 9359 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panama_canal_zone#governance_of_the_canal_zone https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_virgin_islands https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_samoa  where you can find most idealism these days is the eu especially on financial cooperation , m i rite ? 
  maybe i 'm just one of those small government hick americans , but i just do n't think most casual transactions are the state 's business for protection or liability services at all . 
  * in pravda there is no news , in izvestia there is no truth . 
  * dug out one of those few instances english preserves ablaut from its germanic past . 
  but that seems a much better approach than simply silencing the history , particularly if there are grievances with it . 
  * to be able to destroy with good conscience , to be able to behave badly and call your bad behavior ` righteous indignation ' -- this is the height of psychological luxury , the most delicious of moral treats * it 's not so much we want war , but the running joke ( one of them ) among us gun owners is that if someone were to invade the mainland united states , we could finally unleash all the hatred/absurd munitions that people accuse us of stashing away with a reasonable enough excuse . 
  the dead coming to life , alien invasions and the like are also humorously acknowledged as being in the same vein . 
  it 's all tongue in cheek/self-aware humor poking fun at the survivalism and macho tendencies that exist within the firearms owning community of 18-40 year old men which often draws a lot of ire from regulatory-inclined portions of the political spectrum . 
  i have relatives in who 've spent most of their lives in texas who cheered when the naval base at mehran was attacked by the taliban because it was the ` monsters they made doing what monsters do ' and they had a sense those casualties were deserved by the pakistani nation all because of beefs going back to 1947 they were n't even alive to see . 
  it 's not * quite * the same situation as the balkans/former yugoslavia/ussr 's various tensions , but i get the emotional side of it . 
  except putin 's federation , the party 's soviet , and the tsar 's empire * all * pursued the same strategies of formenting dissent where it was convenient , silencing dissent , and using outright force to crush opposition in order to control and fortify a buffer region spanning the urals/caucasus . 
  whether the mode of economic production and policy body was mercantile/imperialist , socialist/communist , or state managed capitalist/allegedly democratic , the security branch of the economy , polity , security nation-state has * always * been like this in russia - - always boot-to-throat diplomacy for its weaker neighbors ( occasionally just viewed as slightly different russians who ought be ` owned ' by russia anyway ) so as to best insulate itself from the ( occasionally truly intrusive polish and german designs ) west . 
  when you ignore this , to people who are on the receiving end of it , it looks a * lot * like you condone it . 
   if the soviet union as an empire had one redeeming feature it was that it kept the ethnic tensions of the region at bay ... dude . 
  via literally putting people into rail cars at gun point and sending them to labor/death camps in siberia for charges of anything from anti-revolution activities to collaboration with nazis , to espionage to treason to just being unlikeable to stalin and replacing them with russian settlers/making their kids all speak russian . 
   i know that reddit believes that it 's all just russia today and evil kgb agents , but for people who had some stability and protection under the soviet regime , ethno-nationalism is fucking scary . 
  as a brown skinned first generation ` merican , i would agree vis a vis our southern border and la raza . 
  and i would say it 's even scarier when that ethno-nationalism is used to promote conflicts within another nations ' territory by an outside force who seeks to make that region ` independent ' for its later annexation . 
  but what 's a nation ? 
  what 's ' a people ' ? 
  and on what grounds is it acceptable ? 
  that 's the whole issue . 
  unless moravia and the confederacy get to live again , there are lines to be drawn . 
  put another way : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laffer_curve when you make laws , especially blatantly numerical laws of input/output , easy and relatively painless to follow , compliance increases . 
  the trick is just to do it so that the law actually has an effect . 
   little tasks off the books , anything that 's just manual labor ... lets have a beer , now we 're friends , we wo n't get the governments ' noses in what i do and not do for a friend , will we ? 
  to be fair , i think * most * western people will do casual labor for their friends and accept cash or food/drink remuneration without involving payment receipt or tax forms because that kind of compensated-cooperation forms the basis of pretty all cooperative human relationships that exist without government in the first place . 
  you do n't pay your girlfriend for sex in order for her to buy tickets for her share of the movie , right ? 
   the territories in question which are abkhazia , south ossetsia and transnistria were actually reasonable prosperous regions within the soviet union right , but as the ussr no longer exists , what came * from * it was the georgian nation , declaring independence , because it was a sovereign nation and people * before * the soviet union annexed it . 
   declared de-facto independency pretty much in the early 90 's . 
  yeah , those particular regions of sovereign nations russia had annexed , declared their independence from the sovereign nation which separated itself . 
  i agree .
