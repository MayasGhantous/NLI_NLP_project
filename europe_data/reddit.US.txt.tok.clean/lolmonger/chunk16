   now you can have long historical discussions going back to the russian empire , but that was n't the actual point . 
  well , but it 's sort of relevant , because there 's a reason americans who have never been to texas and never will would pretty much freak the fuck out if cameron county , texas voted for `` independence '' and later was annexed by matamoros municipality , and then absorbed into mexico in 2025 . 
  history matters , territorial control matters , autonomy matters , and * claim * matters . 
  and the issue is , claims of ownership that are predicated on massive oppression , ethnic cleansing , and proxy-war violence * really are n't fucking cool * , as opposed to things like war treaties and buying land hundreds of years ago . 
   these regions were thrown into civil wars and ethic conflicts as it often happens when big states fail and regions balkanize . 
  and we know what was going down in the balkans while europe told itself `` never again '' right ? 
  serbians were n't just trying to assert political control , they were trying to ` remove kebab ' and ensure the territorial control was built on ethnic control . 
  that 's why it was so ghastly . 
   you can make a good case that russia intentionally fueled resentment in ukraine , but in the georgian regions these are genuine conflicts . 
  ` south ossetian ' and `` abkhazian ' agitations for independence ( and what may someday be trans-dnistrian rebellions ... ) would seem a whole lot more credible if their default was n't to pursue violence against a nation with what seem to be russian federation munitions , materiel , training , and occasionally combat support . 
   georgia actually started a large scale military offensive only if you ignore anything that happened before 2008 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgia_within_the_russian_empire https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgian_soviet_socialist_republic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_ossetia#history https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_of_georgians_in_south_ossetia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991%e2%80%9392_south_ossetia_war russia did n't pursue overt russification policies like it did against ukraine , but it 's * pretty * obvious that they tacitly supported landgrabs and ethnic alteration of population centers in territory they wanted to control , so that those territories would agitate for independence , war with the actual country whose land it was , and precipitate a conflict with russia that the country could n't really win . 
  it worked in georgia , so russia has done it to ukraine most recently . 
  imagine if people in saarland started taking over police stations with famas rifles and blocking access to the rest of germany , and after a few show votes , government offices and functions started being done in french and not in german . 
  and imagine that there was such a mass of french speaking fighters with german citizenship that the gsg9 was n't able to stop them and war powers against them could n't immediately be pursued , and in this time , they became a uniformed , office-d , and documentation having self-declared `` r\u00e9publique du la sarre '' . 
  and did so after killing/driving out lots of german speaking german nationals who were loyal to the bundesrepublik . 
  and now imagine that this situation , wherein they 're using their own uniforms and setting up their own laws , and they have a flag and an anthem , and are establishing trade/economic relations with other french speaking countries , and getting economic development and humanitarian assistance from france continues for a couple decades . 
  and now imagine germans who live nearby are starting to have their territory encroached on , and fighting breaks out between the bundeswehr and the new `` nation '' and then people in spain chastise the germans for `` starting a war '' where france `` intervenes '' to protect french speaking peoples . 
  that 's what 's happening , and that 's why people are downvoting you . 
  nations are people who decide to look out for one another to the mutual benefit of themselves and the exclusion of others on some basis ( ethnicity , citizenship if they 're a nation state , maybe even separated * from * ethnicity ) in the domains of security , economy , and polity . 
  their decision making around killing , production of wealth , and distribution of wealth/investments in the future are meant to be for their benefit principally , and to the exclusion or detriment of others . 
  it 's just a bigger system-result of what individual animals do , or what a family unit does . 
  me , me , me , me . 
  the dictum of survival does n't ever go away . 
  there were wars before , there will be wars later , just as surely as gazelles will run from lions trying to eat them while they themselves chew on and kill grasses that are merely trying to propagate in the soil . 
  [ historically , russia has good cause to want buffer zones/staging grounds/fallback locations ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he6rsljtwdu ) , and the geography of that area and where its cities are means that russian security planners do n't have very many options . 
  the * only * thing to do is economically and socially engage with them , so that they have less and less need to feel that their success as a nation will be endangered by the designs of the ` outside ' . 
  it 's like convincing someone you 're their friend as a human , or how wolves do it , or other social animals . 
  there 's a very delicate interplay of shows of aggression/affection ( exposing our * teeth * is how we smile , an aggressive sign in most species ) that all social animals use to basically communicate : `` yo , i 'm not trying to fuck your shit up , mate with your partner , or steal your food , let 's work together , eh ? '', 
  and then they can proceed cooperatively instead of competitively . 
  making that happen without accidents of history like revolutions and reconcilliations is tough , and the consequences dire , but it 's not like putin 's thinking is outdated * or * arbitrary . 
  it 's just very cold and cynical about what the west wants in terms of russian success . 
  i am one of * the * most jingoistic and cynical americans that bothers posting here . 
  i think the usa 's development of anglo culture and citizenship based on memetic/ideological membership instead of pure ethnic membership , coupled with deliberate individual rights protections is one of the most uplifting and beautiful things mankind has done , and that systems like the russian way of doing things ( either during imperialist times or soviet ones or federation ones ) that rely on coercion are disgusting and worse and `` wrong '' . 
  i literally do think the american way is better , that the evidence of this is everyone adopting secular , constitutional , pluralist democracies , market economies with varying degrees of social redistribution of wealth ( instead of large degrees of control over the production of wealth ) , and the fact that our culture has come to dominate and define `` westernity '' , much as the russian adoption of first traditional authoritarian rule with its czars , and then its party committees came to dominate and define coercive rule , serves as proof of this . 
  http://www.bartleby.com/73/2045.html alexis de tocqueville , 1835  there are now two great nations in the world which , starting from different points , seem to be advancing toward the same goal : the russians and the anglo-americans . 
   america 's conquests are made with the plowshare , russia 's with the sword . 
  to attain their aims , * the former relies on personal interest and gives free scope to the unguided strength and common sense of individuals * . 
  the latter in a sense * concentrates the whole power of society in one man * . 
  one has freedom as the principal means of action ; the other has servitude . 
  their point of departure is different and their paths diverse ; nevertheless , * each seems called by some secret desire of providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of half the world . 
  * that was * the * contest of the cold war , and that 's largely the lines on which there is `` the west '' and the `` ussr '' or the `` people 's republic of china '' as is now much the balance of powers . 
  and i very much side with the individualist approach . 
  http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_109141.htm ^ but that 's * such fucking bullshit * and the person typing it had to know it . 
   russian officials claim that us and german officials promised in 1990 that nato would not expand into eastern and central europe , build military infrastructure near russia 's borders or permanently deploy troops there . 
   no such pledge was made , and no evidence to back up russia 's claims has ever been produced . 
  should such a promise have been made by nato as such , it would have to have been as a formal , written decision by all nato allies . 
  furthermore , the consideration of enlarging nato came years after german reunification . 
  this issue was not yet on the agenda when russia claims these promises were made . 
  like , at the * highest * levels of security policy , we basically have the two most nuked-up factions in the world saying : `` nuh * uh !, 
  * '' about what one promised the other in terms of signalling trust and cooperation . 
  this shit is really , really complicated and high stakes . 
  so , while i ca n't condone it , and think putin is murderous fuckhead , and fundamentally do not trust the intentions of the russian federation towards eastern europe as their economies and nations grow having thrown off the yoke of communism to become western , capitalist nations - - - - he 's not * outdated * in his thinking , and he 's not entirely causeless in thinking so . 
  it 's not like how one has to think about , say , isis or whatever wahabist movement is currently happening , where there 's a clear * religious * / supernatural commandment to commit violence in pursuit of political goals that has nothing to do with reality . 
  that 's a whole ` nother ballgame . 
   is greece truly subordinate to the european central bank ? 
  even if there were n't an explicit legislative mechanism before , it 's clear they are now . 
   i mean surely the greek-eu relationship is n't like the federal-state relationship in the u.s. , where the federal government will send the u.s. military to invade your state and burn your shit to the ground if you try and leave . 
  sure - - - but it 's much closer to the federal government eventually strongarming all states into adopting a 21 + drinking age or lose out on federal highway funding . 
  [ constitutional amendments did n't leave the federal government any authority to make it so ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) , and they [ instead exercised a practical authority instead of a legislative one . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_minimum_drinking_age_act )  greece is still autonomous , is it not ? 
  it is clearly no longer entirely functionally autonomous in its finances , as its chief executive/head of legislature just decided to accept terms dictated to him by non-greek nationals who represent the interests of the transnational currency union and their own nations . 
  are ruthenian/rusyn and ukrainian intelligible to you guys ? 
  or is kind of like portuguese for spanish speakers where written out , you know what 's going on , but spoken interpretation is tough ? 
  post-federal reserve , i do n't know why everyone is always so goddamn surprised that central banking and political federation creates economic and policy tools to discipline subordinate financial and political entities in favor of the central authority . 
   we 're talking about millions getting their modern equivalent pitchforks and hunting down everyone responsible . 
  so , pitchforks . 
   however , turkey is right there over the border . 
  yeah , but it 's turkey . 
  look at their internal political processes and the isis allegations + all the shit with greece . 
  i do n't know they 're the most reliable of partners long term . 
   four days of combat which they lost does not make a battle seasoned fighting force . 
  i 'm not saying it makes them competent . 
  i 'm saying it means they have first hand recollection of how and by what methods * russian federation troops in officially sanctioned war operations can devastate a national military which was undergoing us training in a matter of days * . 
  that is crucial . 
   i 'm not sure what you mean by this . 
  poland is on track to meet the two percent guideline , estonia is already there . 
  france and germany do whatever it takes to not do more . 
  if the georgians were in nato , i 'd imagine their commitment would look much more like polish or romanian commitment than french or german commitment . 
   and what about the territory they already took ? 
  the conflict can easily flare up again . 
  flare up because of * whom * ? 
  russian initiation ? 
  not a chance ; same reason for all that 's happened to ukraine , * not a goddamn thing * has come out of kaliningrad to harm polish interests . 
  the russians know they ca n't fuck with them now . 
   the public in the baltic countries is n't that sure that nato would defend them if needed . 
  [ the united states of america will .

   your source is weak and contradictory no it is n't . 
  wikipedia got it from here : https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/national-gang-threat-assessment-2009-pdf http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/mac_donald04-13-05.htm http://www.cis.org/gangannouncement from ice , to the fbi , to national law enforcement organizations , there 's lots and lots of data confirming what i said . 
  ** you just did n't read more than the first portion of the wikipedia page i linked to **, 
  agreed . 
  accident of great convenience . 
  well , there 's texas ... 
  but also other territories/states : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish%e2%80%93american_war to this day in cuba there are those who claim the uss maine was deliberately sabotaged and her sailor 's killed to flame us support for anti-spanish foreign policy , and ultimately the war that ended in us receiving guam , the philippines , and puerto rico . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overthrow_of_the_kingdom_of_hawaii also , we straight up had business interests of us nationals who came to hold superior numbers/control in the kingdom of hawaii force its coup with the intention of the us eventually annexing ( partly via desire of government officials for the island outright , partly via a desire by the government to protect us citizens ) the entire chain of islands and making it a protectorate and state . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apology_resolution official usg stance on the matter is `` yeah , we deliberately overthrew your nation and annexed it and destroyed your sovereignty as a people , who are now nationals of our country '', 
  paul krugman is widely recognized in the us as being an obviously intelligent economist ( nobel prizes do n't come for nothing ) , but an incredibly political one , and far to the left . 
  howard zinn is highly regarded as a historian here too , but no one thinks of him as * objective * by any means . 
  anyway , you 're right ; he 's writing mostly for the audience of those nyt reading liberals ( much like the opinion pieces of the guardian as of late ) who were they in england some time ago would probably be fabian school socialists but here are comfortably liberals , telling them exactly what they want to hear about the greek situation because of how it maps on to their ideas about state power and redistribution . 
  stiglitz is another one they love , and friedman and hayek the nobel prize winning economists they hate .
