  it 's a tragedy . 
  but if it 's going to be a tragedy whose burden of correction is shared , then it ought be * shared * , and hesistance to put into action any plan to fix the problem because it seems like it 's falling on the shoulders of some taxpayers in particular should n't be called the sentiments of ` assholes ' . 
  it 's not like germany is the only non-greek eu member with an economy and liquid cash to support the greeks . 
  eh , without america 's urban centers and their rife poverty/gang membership , our stats would be way different . 
  the difference between the us having firearms crime profiles like germany or the czech republic is becase we have places like camden , detroit , d.c. , chicago , la , etc. 
  and they do n't . 
  even within cities , you can see the problem ; the south bronx is violent , meatpacking district is * not * , but they 're both `` new york city '' the overwhelming majority of our firearms crime is committed by long term criminals , often linked to gang disputes ( generally stemming from drug crime ) , and simply orthogonal to the lives and practice of most americans and most gun owners . 
  if there were millions and millions and millions of roma in the czech republic , many of them living in specific areas of their absolute largest cities , and they had drug laws which created a revolving door of impossible to employ , buy perpetually supported people who * also * had means of accessing firearms illegally , then , yeah , they 'd have a fuck ton of urban crime , too . 
  but they do n't , so they do n't . 
  there 's so much butthurt in this thread from firearm rights bereft europeans who still have shootings . 
  he 's from liberal urban california . 
  going into histrionics about religious conservatives is a competitive sport over there . 
  do the chechens get to make their choice ? 
  the reason to have overwhelming force ( by the way , a quick inspection of the military capabilities of russia and china , two of the most potent non-western economies and polities shows that individual european nations * do not * posses overwhelming force by themselves ) is so that war operations - - again , the killing of soldiers , sinking of ships , downing of aircraft , immobilization of vehicles and the occupation of land - - can be done with minimal losses sustained and significant losses inflicted . 
  if the us has to go to war , we will lose people . 
  we will have some of our parents , siblings , and children come home in boxes . 
  many more will come back physically and mentally broken , some permanently so . 
  that 's been true each time . 
  but when we go to war , they will lose more than us . 
  they will lose many more for each american they take , and the political outcome , perhaps in a year , perhaps five , perhaps over a few decades , will be closer to the one we wanted . 
  the point of nato , between your nation and mine , but this goes for all the others , is that just as us soldiers will kill and die to protect the lives and fortunes of the american people and the republic , so too will they kill and die to defend the lives and interests of the dutch people and the kingdom . 
  for your security and prosperity , we have committed to some of our people coming home in boxes . 
  the obligation is mutual , shared . 
  it makes sense for the burden of these obligations to be shared . 
  does the world become more unsafe when i leave my doors unlocked ? 
  it 's quite clear half of an entire nation 's economic output should n't be commandeered by government and spent on military hardware and troops to protect the other half ( if it were even possible to sustain a civil society at such a point ) it 's also pretty obvious that without any kind of military whatsoever , but broad trade and economic productive interests relying on sovereign natural resources , control over geography for trade routes , and the safety of people ( including foreign nationals ) who produce , a nation is not meeting security obligations . 
  the problem is particularly knotty in an alliance , because now people are estimating what they have to lose against how sure they are others will help them anyway - - it 's the most venal kind of free rider problem . 
  ** but ** , fundamentally , it comes down to this :  i really do n't think it would make us any safer . 
  * who is us ? 
  * because the point of nato is that * each * nation does its best to enter into a framework of credible * mutual * defense . 
  it 's not just about securing the lives and security and future prosperity of dutch people . 
  in the same way us troops are * obliged * to follow the orders of their commanders to engage armed enemies and fight risking death and injury in keeping american interests secure , * under article 5 of nato * they are * also * obliged to do so for the interests of nato members if they come under attack as outlined by that part of the charter . 
  the point of the netherlands being in such an alliance is that * dutchmen do n't exclusively fight and die * for other dutchmen . 
  in return the protection they recieve from other members , they * also * prioritize the shared security of those members . 
  it 's easy to forget , but the point of a military , from single rifleman to a unified nuclear command , is to credibly present the ability and will to - -- if the security of a nation is disrupted by people using lethal force in the pursuit of advancing a hostile nation 's interests - - to * kill people * . 
  to kill human beings , putting bullets through their chest cavities and skulls , crushing them under buildings that are bombed , burning them alive in their vehicles with incendiary and armor piercing ordnance , etc. 
  the point of a military is to be able to do these things , and credibly threaten to do these things , so that disputes about the interests of nations are solved by the negotiation and compromise we use with our `` own '' people , against whom we would never contemplate such measures . 
  * that * is what it comes down to . 
  it 's not about `` being safe '' because you can have some token show of force . 
  military alliances are about being safe because each member is mutually obliged to go help another member - at the expense of their own nationals lives - - kill other people . 
  the netherlands and italy and greece and america and britain and germany , etc. 
  - - nato members - - are all nations whose governments and peoples have pretty much decided that trade is good , their cultures and values are close enough they know they 'd never want to see the other hurt or hurt them themselves , and so it makes sense to secure each others prosperity in this way . 
  dutch defense budgets as a nato nation simply are n't just supposed to be about keeping the netherlands alone safe . 
  goodness . 
  i guess a german system where we are n't making * incredibly * valuable and ultimately necessary jobs like electricians and carpenters and * literal * builders low prestige jobs . 
  i 'd really rather see a lot of currently 4 year us degrees have the liberals arts ` common curriculum ' cut out , and turned into something in between our associates and your vordiplom . 
  where it can be a terminal degree in a technical field for those professions that need some kind of certification and standardization , but also an opportunity for young people to have a college life , but * not * be a goddamn four to six year affair . 
  the us government can be pretty shitty , too - - no reason to let the designs of warmongers here or there ruin things . 
  right , right , that 's what i found hilarious - - he just would n't let the joke go and made it a new one . 
  i hope he was muttering something like `` ehhh , your tie seems very light in color '' or something . 
  because they have generous amounts of paid time off . 
  that 's the biggest reason . 
  it derives from this : 1 ) men are expected , uniformly in all societies , to be breadwinners . 
  they are either gainfully employed , full-time workers as single , childless men/newly married men/long time married men or divorcees . 
  in * no * social arrangement are men desirable to women or socially valued if they are n't gainfully employed full-time . 
  seriously , if you 're 18-65 in the western world , male , and have no income , or are n't studying to earn an income , you 're a * failure * . 
  produce or die . 
  if you do n't believe that 's true , you 've never been a man trying to get a date outside of secondary school . 
  2 ) childcare is n't a simple thing . 
  it 's possibly one of the most crucial , demanding things a person can do . 
  if it were n't for orgasm , i 'm pretty sure even non-human species that have high investment in their offspring would die off . 
  it 's a long-term reward , and it 's tough . 
  it 's literally making a witless baby , a naive child , and an ignorant teenager into a functioning , competent adult . 
  the sheer gulf of knowledge and values and civic obligations and interpersonal conduct and self-regulation that has to be imparted from parent to child is astounding . 
  our physiology dictates its necessity ( look up the situation romanian orphans ) from a tender age onward , and the quality of parenting is implicated in all sorts of permanent life trends . 
  it 's pretty much what determines the vast cultural differences that make the distinction between ` native ' and ` immigrant ' . 
  it 's huge . 
  and women are the ones who do it , largely , because of 1 ) 3 ) career advancement takes time , too , and no one wants a breast or bottle feeding/crying baby in the boardroom while capital expenditures are being planned . 
  unless you 're employed in one of those areas where `` seniority '' comes with magical advancement and pay , it 's delivering on work promises and exceeding them that gets you more money , more responsibilities , and more career options . 
  this takes time and effort that people who have been educated , and have stamina , earning concerns ( * often * to support or start a family !, 
  ) , and future time working to make * worth * promoting , alone posses . 
  it 's inherently tilted towards younger people . 
  4 ) when material difficulties are obviated , things that would 've ` cost ' money now no longer do . 
  it is n't just that generous maternity leave terms provide a woman who is busy being a mother ( and not working ) an income , it 's * also * that it keeps the cost of * not * working hidden . 
  when you 're still getting cash in your bank account , you do n't see yourself losing out on money . 
  the psychological feeling of missing out on earning just wo n't be there , and they 'll be more likely to focus on maternal duties and not work . 
  it even holds when you 're not looking at benefits , but * chosen * home commitment over work commitment . 
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3387873/ seriously , what better proxy for us * mammals * than this ? 
  _____________________________ this is all unpopular to talk about , because `` men and women are equal !!!!!!! '' . 
  biologically , they 're complementary . 
  our humanity 's competitiveness is a system wide result of gender/biological dimorphism that effectively splits roles in halves , leaving each to do the other better than if there were no distinctions - - it 's the same schema that makes multicellular , differentiable cell life able to be more complex than single celled propagation . 
  ** i am not ** saying women should n't have careers , or that there is any particular problem with them working , or that all humans must fulfill their biological destiny as father and mother . 
  i 'm just saying , you ca n't have your cake and eat it , too . 
  if women are going to be * right there alongside * men in work environments , they 're going to find that their desires for children and family and being caregivers as moms * conflict * with their duties as workers , because all those work demands have grown up around the fact that * working men * are * absent * much of the time around the house and expected to be material providers . 
  further , * if you make maternity easier * you are making career work * harder * . 
  personally , i think the entry of women in the workforce in the us ( largely post-ww2 ) should have come with deliberately crafted legislation to ensure that we had a situation of women and men each working half as much as men had worked before , so that men could have more of a role in the home , while women could have more of a role in the workplace , as equals . 
  instead , employers have a nearly doubled pool of applicants to a static number of jobs worldwide , and at their most extreme , * some * issues with hiring women who are more likely to take leave for raising kids . 
  we ca n't keep ignoring social outcomes of biological reality and mourn the dearth of scandinavian women ceos while also saying `` ya , of course they should have super duper benefits to be mothers and not become ceos '', 
  my favorite was him comparing ties with everyone , and then doing it to tsipras without a tie as well . 
  it 's good , seeing someone accomplished in a serious position being able to be a human . 
  makes me feel less worried about getting older . 
   i 'm dutch ahhhhh , okay , i get it now . 
  your flag fooled me !, 
  get the kingdom 's colors !, 
   it 's our biggest neighbouring country uhhhhhhh bro , that 'd be mexico ( even canada has more people than vz ), 
  i called it a guideline , too . 
   but somehow the us have managed to spread the idea that a figure they * plucked from the sky is anything more than their aspiration . 
  * i 'm not disputing it 's a guideline . 
  i 'm disputing the notion that it is arbitrary or unrealistic , because that notion is what leads people to start thinking :  that europe should n't be funding our own defence am i making sense , cuz ' ? 
  there are two ways isolation , imposed or pursued , can go , i think : 1 ) the isolated party builds a parallel world and is self sufficient in it and actually develops to the extent that non-isolation in the future becomes valuable because of their distinction , and everything works out okay later when re-engagement happens 2 ) they begin to crumble the second one results either in their being subsumed by outside forces , or their lashing out .
