  a people have to feel united to act that way , and europe ( again , whatever that means outside of a geography ) is attempting to create non-uniform systems of government without even a basic european identity and hoping it 'll stick, 
  ** quick , put them on trial in france for inciting racial hatred !, 
  hell , even * in * pennsylvania there 's huge difference . 
  [ this is the county where i grew up ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/asylum_township.jpg ) , and this is the [ biggest city , philadelphia ] ( https://tranquilshores.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/philadelphia.jpg ) the mayor of that city keeps trying to pass `` assault weapons '' bans . 
  i do n't think i can name a single neighbor back home who does n't own one or two firearms . 
  the notion that europe could ever have * less * heterogeneity than the us is plain silly . 
  that 's really just not true . 
  pennsylvania , maryland , virginia and new york in 1776 were much , much closer in economy , polity , religion , ethnicity , and governance norms than they are * now * even , and certainly closer than exists in modern europe where not even the languages are the same . 
  we 're * still * not a centralized federation even after the civil war and post-ww2 massive expansion of the federal government . 
  we * still * have state 's rights fights with the feds . 
  we * still * have regional animosities and totally different laws because of differing identities and values . 
  those things do n't go away with legal binding , they just become worse and are more pronounced in europe . 
  ** then again ** in the us we also have a constitutional framework which specifically limits the federal government with respect to the states and the people , the states with respect to the people , and which establishes a minimum spanning set of liberties the people retain indefinitely , despite states being subordinate to the federal government . 
  we have a system of courts and redress , and despite certain progressive tendencies to want this to be a matter of federal dictum in d.c. in all matters of policy and judge-written law , states ' rights is how we pushed gay rights into legality , marijuana further along , and retain so many of our firearms rights and low taxes . 
  we 've a federal courts system and reserve system that spans several us states an an intermediary of policy judgement and finance between state and federation , and individual states ( while they have no sovereignty on federal issues ) have a tremendous degree of latitude on everything from weapons law to taxation to argricultural subsidy . 
  this deliberately constructed framework is what we arrived on after the articles of confederation , and a civil war , and really came into its own after the second world war when the us 's ascendancy became unquestionable . 
  europe does n't have anything like this because it has n't had any of the conversations about national identity and sovereignty and rights and powers and limits on government as * europeans * where spaniards and lithuanians and slovaks and italians all have to figure out what their priorities are , how they compete/cooperate , and how their concerns should be represented , and what the ground rules for rule making and judgement are . 
  there are core american values surrounding speech , weapons , privacy and justice - - there are core american concerns about financial stability and economic freedom - - there are core american notions of identity and nation and government . 
  there is an american identity and value structure , and from that derives its governance and the maintenance of it . 
  ** that does n't exist for europe ** and that 's why everything from ukraine to the migrants to the eurozone has been a complete clusterfuck . 
   the eu has proven itself to be incompetent three times now . . ukraine , greece and migration . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d1ooe/surrender_fiscal_sovereignty_in_return_for/ct197e5 https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c8b7h/do_you_think_that_this_could_be_a_beginning_of/cst61va this has been my view of the eu for a while now : it ( whatever the delineation of `` europe '' will be ) either needs to see its individual sovereign nations ** die ** much as there is n't * really * an england , wales , scotland , or northern ireland , but there * is * a united kingdom , despite some residual ethnic and linguistic differences ... ... or europe should remain a geography , and nations with in it should have their choice of alignment on different issues and cooperation/exclusion on others . 
  ** nations are polity , economy , and military ** they are cohesive only because they share political making processes and laws , economic and financial activity , and the use of force in protecting and asserting the other two . 
  that 's it . 
  if you have a group of people who all decide to take up arms en masse , establish governance and do trade with the ` outside ' of their group on the basis of sustaining their own prosperity , you 've a family , a clan , a tribe , a nation , a state . 
  but the eu ( on whatever basis it chooses to be `` european '' , from geography or otherwise membership in other alliances ) has repeatedly failed . 
  it ** can not ** conduct itself economically coherently or politically coherently , sharing burdens among members for the sake of the greater good . 
  in fact , the powers that be seem to be attempting to force political union after it becomes clear that the eurozone crisis and migrant crisis - - both times led by germany 's diktat - - are totally unsolvable with the structures in place . 
  the eu 's member states in terms of security obligations to themselves and each other ( forget nato ) are * laughable * . 
  india could wipe the floor with most of the eu . 
  china could wipe the floor with most of the eu . 
  russia could wipe the floor with most of the eu . 
  the only thing preventing this is that many eu nations are tied into nato , which is nearly an entirely us led security venture . 
  ** are ukrainians european ? 
  ** ** are greeks european ? 
  ** ** are turks european ? 
  ** does their non-eu membership change things ? 
  does their ez membership change things ? 
  does their nato membership change things ? 
  because if the stressors those nations present to * those * alliances and frameworks , which are n't even the policy ones of the eu , but international relations , financial relations , and foreign military relations ca n't have a unified `` european '' response ( whatever the fuck that 's supposed to mean at this point ) , then the whole project is an absurdity . 
  union is very , very difficult . 
  we still have n't figured it out entirely : plenty of us are modern day analogues of anti-federalists still - - our political fights are * still * on federal/state rights , are * still * on the diversity of culture and values and policy priorities that exist in a nation where everyone speaks the same language and melds their ethnicity . 
  ** how is union supposed to work in europe ? 
  what is `` europe '' supposed to mean ? 
  ** and will it serve everyone 's interests , or dissatisfy everyone ? 
  these conversations have been long over due , and as far as i can tell , have n't been had since the coal and steel commission days . 
  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=four https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indo-european_vocabulary#kinship have fun discovering your membership ( linguistic or ethnic/genetic ) in the largest and most successful super-family of humanity ever to exist . 
  because lots of unscrupulous business interests ( who have influence with the right ) rely on the cheap labor , and lots of unscrupulous politicians ( on the left ) rely on the ethnic voting bloc . 
  when 1/3 of the country will be latino , and mexican origin legal and illegal immigrants make up a huge portions of the ever growing foreign born and recently foreign origin population , many of whom have voting rights and children and ties here , it 's easy for people who want to undercut us labor protections and remake the us electorate to not deport them , and in fact offer them policy favor . 
  in-state college tuition reserved for residents , drivers licenses , repeated amnesty , ` deferred action ' on deportation , etc. 
  there 's a reason we have 11 million illegals here and our demographic outlook is being remade . 
   savages who are hardwired to always try to kill each other if they 're marginally different from one another and happen to inhabit the same state . 
  you realize this straight up describes literally every epoch in human warfare , right ? 
  whatever differences you think are ` marginal ' are often enough someone else thinks another person deserves being killed . 
  they 're acting like california and new york would act if there were n't a federal senate constraining them , and strong state governments which pursue their own policy . 
  golden opportunity for poland to draw up agreements with other slavic/eastern eu/european nations about border security and financial cost distribution and materiel/personnel sharing for border security and migrant processing . 
  without consulting the eu , without listening to germany , and offering a legal framework as leader for many nations not served by german policy to deal with reality . 
  what 's germany going to do ? 
  not give them money ? 
  sanction them ? 
  time to call the bluff on the idea that the union is the same as german diktat . 
  modern india is different , but lots of immigrants from india and pakistan and bangladesh ( those who came in the 70s through 90s ) , who had kids in the west ( who were born from the late 70s through the early 90s ) came out of being born in india in the late 40s through mid 50 's , and were raised with views about sex , about marriage , about gender roles , and about work-roles in the home that are much closer to what the grandparents ( a generation prior to the current one ) of the west had . 
   he means that hindus and sikhs and muslims would have been best buddies on this front with our ( christian ) grandparents . 
  no , i mean that recent immigrant 's hindu/sikh/muslim views about gender roles , about sex and marriage , about family , and about work are pretty consonant with the west 's older cultural milieu . 
   our grandparents where racists/xenophobic . 
  notice , i pointed out that people back in the day in lots of western countries had lots of racist views . 
  but with the logistical capacity and mobilization of the military . 
  i think a lot more border protection and processing is about to be deployed , and this is a smart way to do it . 
  after all , this is no longer a simple police issue ; it 's about national territorial integrity - - that 's precisely the in between level of national conflict and law enforcement things like the gsg9 and other paramilitaries around the world normally do , and hungary is being decisive in getting the army involved ( migrants seeing * troops * in fatigues are going to respond differently to them than uniformed police officers ) , and principled in specifying boundaries of force . 
  i 'd argue arranged marriages existed even afterwards in some sense , with tremendous societal pressure for sexual partners to be marital ones and frequent changes of sexual partners looked down on . 
  it 's only very recently that cohabitation and non - marriage has become socially permissible in the west ( particularly in anglo countries : the dutch have been alternative for a while ) , chiefly because home economics and sexual mores have been so totally altered . 
  sex and marriage and marriage and love and home and family are not all completely united in the west anymore . 
  the economic and social situation of many immigrants from places with traditional cultures is much more like that of the west 50 , 60 years ago than is obvious at first blush . 
  a lot of hindus and sikhs and muslims in the west , were there no racial discrimination against them , would find their views about home and family and sex and children and work-roles to be very much mainstream in the society of their current peers grandparents . 
  well , but the fear comes because of the license of violence which remains uncontested and unexamined that the religion of islam gives to those who want to commit it against people who insult the prophet or allah . 
  it would n't be an issue of hard changes were pressed for on a policy level , but that ca n't happen because of the religious card . 
  the czechs are like someone mixed both together . 
  better hardware and more of it . 
  they 're on track to meet two percent guidelines for nato , but they 're doing it mostly though a modernization of their forces . 
  new tanks , new rifles , patriot missile batteries , saab and lockheed contracts to modernize their mig 29s and f-16s to be competitive aircraft again . 
  they 've got their own currency and robust economic growth , they 've got a really strong national identity -- - really they just need to start having more babies . 
  they 're poised to kick a lot of ass in the coming decades . 
  either stay out of world affairs and do n't treat millions of people 's lives like pieces on a chessboard ... ... or be willing to bring such a nightmarish slaughter against your enemies that your aims being challenged is not an option . 
  war is disgusting : [ it means mothers looking at their babies , all dead ] ( http://www.sott.net/image/s9/191154/large/iraq_warvistims_children.jpg ) , it means decades of wondering [ why the rpg killed him and not you ] ( http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5606/4130/400/iraq_troops03-14-2006b.0.jpg ) , frantically trying to stop [ a friend 's bleeding while he dies in front of you ] ( http://binaryapi.ap.org/367bfcf78f084882819b8e55a847caa6/512x.jpg ) , it means [ market places exploding ] ( http://russia-insider.com/sites/insider/files/syria_2707973b.jpg ) if a situation is not * so * vital to our core national security interests that we can be comfortable at a policy level with total and unconditional aggression , throwing every bomb , missile and bullet at every beating heart which does not surrender , executing and jailing the political class which opposed us , and installing an occupation government and force for decades to bend a nation or area to our will if necessary ... . . if we are n't comfortable with that , and we think the costs are too high , and we think there have to be limits and timetables and we have to talk about the political risks to election campaigns , and we 're not willing to be * deliberately and unflinchingly brutal * with the enemy . 
  ... then why the fuck bother ? 
  all we 'll do is create misery without forcing a solution , and if the use of force is n't in pursuit of definite solution , it 's aimless savagery . 
  lol : http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2014/05/ft_14.05.26_toporiginsusmap.png changes happen without guns , ~ ~ kumpel ~ ~ amigo . 
   we need a law in order to trump the strength of financial markets eternal wish for profit growth . 
  also in order to actually have it . 
  i 'm a huge proponent of individualism and markets , but making people queue up in line for the sake of passing through a door in an orderly way instead of all persons trying to go all at once is clearly * better * for everyone ; even if it means individuals sacrifice their agency for the collective . 
  markets work , and sometimes they do n't . 
  purely financial considerations work , and sometimes they do n't . 
  how ? 
  writing off loans to eastern nations who have to buy equipment that has to be delivered ? 
  still slower than materiel transfer . 
  everything that is n't a man with a rifle , tank gun , boat cannon or airplane missile advancing into the enemy and firing at them can only be in support of that , and will be slower than that in achieving the objectives of war . 
  nato can not keep being a two tiered alliance . 
  like poland adopting the euro , i think sweden would be better served holding off until reforms on deadweight members and basic structural and policy deficiencies are taken care of and just keeping in touch and regular drill with nato members . 
  getting weapons , people , and vehicles places is n't easy . 
  it requires fuel and active supply chains , coordinated communications and support .
