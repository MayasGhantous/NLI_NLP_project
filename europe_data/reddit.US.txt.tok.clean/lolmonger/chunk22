  can you imagine france and germany being answerable to the same union in that way ? 
  but * why * does brussels need to tell italy to do that ? 
  is there really so much massive benefit to italians that their policy makers should consider removing a ban on that kind of foodstuff they as a sovereign people said `` gross '' to ? 
  is the economic future of the eu * imperiled * by italians not purchasing other people 's milk products because they 've such a cultural indignity about bad dairy ? 
  could n't this issue be left alone , while the refugees problem is looked at ? 
  that 's the thing i 'm trying to point out - poor prioritization . 
   comparing it with china and the us is not really valid . 
  we 're talking here about a bunch of nations giving up sovereignty in the 21st century to create a federal state . 
  this is unprecedented , uncharted territory . 
  no , that 's precisely why the contrast is apt . 
  i 'm not trying to say europe has to do what america and china have done . 
  i 'm saying there need to be `` europeans '' in the same way there are `` americans '' or `` chinese '' . 
  that word has to mean something , because it indicates * some * shared identity . 
  i do n't think what china did ( leaving aside the hanification policy of mao ) is at all possible , given the diversity of europe . 
  nor do i think a us approach is possible - spaniards should n't have to give up their sovereignty any more than belgians or slovenes . 
  i think europe must find its own path however , and set about very seriously on forging one where its member nations ( either of the eu or ez , and one will have to become the other , with unified policy , to be sound ) have a voice , are mutually respected and mutually obliged to one another . 
  without such a framework ( and i have written it to be deliberately loose ) , there simply wo n't be anything like a `` europe '' except as a ( disputed ) geographical determination and a ( disputed ) cultural one , nor will there really be `` europeans '' . 
  without that , there wo n't be a 500 million persons unified economy , or military , or polity - the three pillars of a power . 
  europeans have to decide , and decide quickly , what they are , and whether that should mean chinese style dominance ( austria-hungary was an example of such a cultural and linguistic melding under unquestioned power ) for all of europe , american style federation with a lack of sovereignty for * all * but equivalent voices and obligations for all as well , or a third way . 
  i do n't know what that third way could be . 
  i do n't really know what de gaulle planned for france when he removed them from nato , either . 
  they came back , after all . 
  but for all the skepticism i have about some members ( i do think nordic nations would be better off in their own sort of trade/defense/currency union , i do think the uk would be better off on its own , i do think slavic nations should have special arrangements with each other that do n't depend on the west * or * on russia for their self preservation ) and their putative futures in an eu , i can not shake the feeling that far more powerful than the homogenous and single minded chinese diktat and the freewheeling schizophrenia that are the united states ' and our policy choices , would be a true federation of equals in europe , with western values , developed economies and rich heritage and traditions , and a large , large population of consumers , innovators , and soldiers . 
  i do n't know the political path to that , but i think it 's worth any prospective european 's time to think very hard about while they choose whom to vote for . 
  you know , greeks have really just kind of shit the bed on a lot of issues , i wo n't dispute that , but i do hope they can stay in the eurozone and eu . 
  it 'd be awful if there was n't a way to rehabilitate their economy . 
   if greece moved into the russian / chinese geopolitical sphere it would be instantly locked out of the eu power structure and now totally useless to russia and china . 
  i do n't see how it could be locked out . 
  we 're talking about white people ( yeah , i know that should n't matter , but it does ) who are a nato , eu , and ez member . 
  their language and classical society is where we get democracy from . 
  they 're not going anywhere as a western nation , even if there is some nightmare eu/ez breakup or single country expulsion . 
  us styled in uniforms , it seems - pretty sure german and british police are n't big on bribes , either . 
  but it 's good , all the same ; i know ukraine has had massive problems with corruption ( and even poroshenko is n't entirely beyond suspicion ) , but still , taking it on like this , with public affirmation that corruption is a problem , and a whole cohort of younger , newly trained officers who present themselves to their city and swear to do better as law enforcement is solid step in the right direction . 
  i think every public servant and citizen could do with specifically acknowledging their responsibility to try being the best they can , if only to make the lives of everyone around them a little easier . 
  i do n't think they know what salt licks are over there . 
  take a look at the post-comecon status of poland and ukraine in terms of gdp . 
  one stayed a russian satellite , and was rewarded since 1991 with all we 've seen . 
  the other left not just comecon , but the warsaw pact ( well , both dissolved that year ) and russian influence all together . 
  it 's not too surprising there should be a disparity . 
  romania happened to have suffered setbacks the polish did n't have to contend with , but it 's seen massive growth too , because it also took its place in the west . 
  i hope ukrainians and belarussians are able to join the club at some point . 
  it 's distinct from simple overpay returns . 
  if the government of oregon carries more than 2 % of the required budget , that money is sent * back * . 
  rather than being a return of an individual taxpayer 's money if they overpaid ( also present ) , oregon also forbids the government from * retaining * too much money - it goes back to the taxpayers as their payment brackets dictate . 
  it 's their money , after all . 
  the view is that recession vulnerability in state funding is n't nearly as bad as the state collecting massive budgets and spending like drunken sailors . 
  the rebates when due have gone to a school fund since 2012 , but it used to to be straight up checks . 
  politically , there 's no meaningful opposition in china . 
  in so far as ethnic disparity , despite the hong kongers and other non-han/mandarin chinese , and i suppose the uyghur , there 's just not that much personal diversity in china . 
  not that different alleles produce different political thought ; but it 's a good proxy for whether or not people have spent enough time apart that their transmitted culture and value structure could have become different . 
  brics does n't care . 
  if russia and china can have entry way into softpower holds over the european union by holding the reins/pursestrings on greece , it 's absolutely worth the expense . 
  sure , but states also have balanced budget amendments because the federal government is willing to let them go bankrupt . 
  every state besides vermont has budgetary controls in their constitutions because of precedent set long ago , that the fed * will * not come to their aid if they mismanage . 
  in fact , oregon actually * prohibits * the state carrying an excess surplus ; excess money is * returned * to taxpayers in a rebate if the government ends up collecting too much from them . 
  texas is kind of like our bavaria , so it gets dumped on by the other states for how unapologetically brash/over the top its people can be .

   500 million people would be better united . 
  only if they exist as a people in the same way there are chinese , and the same way there are americans . 
  america has unity through ideological propagation ; anyone can come be an american , there 's great latitude in person and political freedom but also minimal guarantees in financial and political security because of a federation of 50 states . 
  china has unity through party fiat and ethnic homogeneity . 
  the pursuit of growth and harmony at the expense of political freedom and ideological heterdoxy has resulted in a massive economic upswing and a robust china , one poised to challenge the us . 
  europe does n't have either of these . 
  it 's not capable of leaving individuality and exceptional production alone to do its own thing : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11704323/italy-eu-request-for-powdered-milk-in-mozzarella-is-attack-on-cultural-heritage.html nor is it willing to accept shared burdens : http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/14/uk-europe-migrants-italy-idukkbn0ou0an20150614 it 's not allowing political autonomy where that counts , and it 's not willing to distribute negative outcome to prevent acute problems being suffered by one member . 
  those are the other side of centralized decision making ( which can be good/necessary ) , and sharing the bounty of a political union - - the things the eu seems to be very keen on . 
  europe does n't seem like it 's in any position to pursue china 's strategy . 
  i ca n't imagine a politburo standing committee in brussels composed of technocrats with control over an `` eu '' military who use it to quash any dissent over the dictated economic and political administration it wants its provinces of germany and poland and slovakia and france ( or whatever ) to pursue as they 've decided , full stop . 
  the eu is just too diverse , the people have their own sense of nation-state ( not to mention their militaries making that a reality !, 
  ) , and it would run really far counter to a lot of european political liberalism and notions of freedom . 
  but the eu seems to loathe the deregulation and federalized but largely hands off approach of the us ( and we have many political figures who want to eschew that as well , and make most policy making a national affair that happens in dc ) . 
  why ** does ** brussels need to tell italy what kind of things can be sold as mozzarella ? 
  why ** ca n't ** the eu help italy out with all the migrants ? 
  i 'm picking italy , and a ( rather bemusing ) hubbub about cheese products , and a slightly less topic situation of burden sharing than greek/eurozone debt - - - but this is pretty much the problem of the eu , and i do n't see anything ` new ' being done to address it . 
  if you get married , and divorce is always an option , or threatened , how stable is that marriage ? 
  and if you get married and are n't willing to put the other person 's happiness first , and they wo n't do the same , etc - - - i do n't see the eu as a cohesive entity anymore . 
  at most , there 's a very curious set of immigration laws , with national governments being pretty parochial about the enforcement duty , a common currency without real fiscal policy , and various regulatory policies that seem to make it a worse place for innovative business and foreign investment than asia or america . 
   it just seems to me that having a common currency between nyc and the rest of the state does n't actually elevate the modest areas to a higher level . 
  it does , but only because albany redistributes from nyc taxes to the entire state 's infrastructure and public systems . 
  then again , taxes as a percentage of home value in nys as compared to the rest of the country are * the * highest in the us , which pretty much makes it impossible for huge numbers of the rural poor in nys to own property and save money . 
  on both counts , i think , the comparison is somewhat apt . 
  but thas * raycissss !, 
  * ^ the rejoinder to anyone in the us even slightly concerned about 15 + million illegals and their 2-4 anchor babies from latin america as the native birthrate declines . 
  i 'm a brown immigrants kid myself , but we assimilated . 
  my parents ' kids are americans . 
  entire communities of people only speaking spanish ? 
  what are they really ? 
  who do * they * identify with ? 
  i vote for non-intervention , most of the time . 
  both parties have their share of hawks , though . 
  political will/being capable of standing alone . 
  it comes down to the same thing - their policy makers growing some balls - that 's all i 'm pointing out . 
  then provide for your own security .
