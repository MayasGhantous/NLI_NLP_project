  freedom means the freedom to fail ; it 's not the freedom to only experience all of the bonuses and niceties of agency - - it means you are * free * to do as you please , and reap what you sow and own your actions . 
  what is the framework that protects me and pays for me , and which i fight for and work for , is what every citizen in a european country ought think hard about . 
  are you a greek ? 
  or are you a european ? 
  are you a german ? 
  or are you a european ? 
  if you 're a european , * european interests will come before greek interests * . 
  * european interests will come before german interests * . 
  it cuts both ways ; providing greece financial assistance , and requiring greece to make changes . 
  you do n't get to have both identities in any real measure . 
  it 's one or the other ; either your national squabbles will become irrelevant , or the big label you put on does n't mean much beyond sharing a geography . 
  this entire debacle has been a fucking joke to the rest of the world . 
  a european union ? 
  what the fuck does that even mean ? 
  what are european interests , in this matter ? 
  the preservation of the euro ? 
  the preservation of national sovereignty ? 
  the establishment of trans-national policy norms ? 
  you do n't take care of your domestic policy , where italy will be told ` tough shit ' when its internal services are getting swamped by mass illegal immigration from outside the eu , by other member nations who do n't care to meet them on any compromise . 
  where the united states has to prod your elected leaders fucking assess into * extending economic sanctions against a nation that invaded and annexed part of a nation that wanted to join you people * . 
  what , were ukrainians * too slavic * , or what ? 
  is the `` european-ness '' of a nation only worth it when they are official members ? 
  is that what europe is ? 
  nothing more ? 
  you do n't even take care of your own security , the us does that for you via nato - - an organization where a nation like estonia with just under as many people as exist in the city of hamburg alone will meet a 2 % gdp guideline , and germany wo n't even fucking bother having a real military when they 've got an economy over 100 times the size . 
  remember fucking libya ? 
  that intervention every single alliance member voted yes on ? 
  that the un cleared ? 
  and then half did n't participate in ? 
  was n't even because of cold-feet . 
  your militaries literally * could n't do anything * against a quarter-century technologically obsolete , fractured military , in northern fucking africa * where migrants in goddamn makeshift boats can sail to your shores from * . 
  utterly fucking shameful . 
  you 've elected leaders that ca n't help europeans in need , you 've elected leaders that ca n't put european priorities ahead of national ones , you 've elected leaders that ca n't even really defend europe . 
  if a greek exit happens , and the eu/ez/euro breaks because of it , one year , five years , a decade from now , good fucking riddance . 
  * try * to take over the world * and in doing so , collapse/hurt a lot of others . 
  i dunno , i think they might need a creepier sounding recording of you . 
  ** this is absolutely retarded . 
  ** [ ** this is nato spending ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8hmtu98.png ) - the raw usd dollar equivalent amounts each nation spends . 
  but as a percentage of gdp , or rather , * how much from each nation * goes to defense : [ ** greece is spending a ton ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aqgkd9n.png ) estonia , everyone ought take notice , is n't fucking its economy or anything , but should totally get kudos from all other nato partners . 
  but back to greece defense issues : here are total [ ** troop numbers ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tprsm6e.png ) but a better way to look at that data , in terms of the strain a nation is taking on , is * how many * of their young , fit , men who would otherwise be in school to join the knowledge based economy , or working in the service and labor economy , are now removed from the labor pool and in the military ( being paid by tax dollars ) : [ ** that is to say , as a percentage of the labor force ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tmncbes.png ) greece is taking a massively outsized role . 
  this is from a post ( a rambling , [ kind of unorganized post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38rqo0/quickdirtyunsophisticated_look_at_nato_burden/ ) ) where i 've complained before about larger western european nations abdicating their nato duties , but part of why i think germany and france and others need to step it up , is because it 's quite clear that their nato allies are in many ways also their eu and eurozone partners . 
  it would behoove them to pick up the slack they 're not carrying , so that the eu/ez obligations could be met . 
  can you imagine a greece confident enough to greatly cut down their military spending , and redirect those young men to work , and redirect a lot of that money to paying debts , and funding their society back into competitive production ? 
  i think it would involve a germany emboldened enough to spend a little more , not on greek welfare , but on german and nato defense . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ mightlaythegroundworkforthealliancebeinglessdependentonturkeyinthefutureasothernationsgottheirshittogethertoo , givenwhaterdoganseemstobedoingvisavisisisandall just my two cents . 
  he has a car , at least . 
  andronovo horizon/urheimat are probably a * little * lower , but the point is that in the modern world , while indigenous or numerous people * should * be able to pursue autonomy , it should n't happen as a result of historical violence on who a third party wanted to absorb , much less * modern * violence via the funding of armed separatists and regular military support under pretexts of people going on vacation or being volunteers . 
  if the us used our army 's special forces to annex parts of mexico or canada with lots of english speaking people present in the way we did to hawaii before , it would be * unforgivable * . 
  hell , our oppression of hawaii in history is already disgusting . 
  russian apologists do n't care about any of this , though . 
  that it 's 2014 or 2015 does n't matter . 
  plus , you clearly do n't need the same language to have a bustling market zone - you just need common standards of buying and selling , and communication on * those * lines . 
  it 's when you start wanting deep policy consonance and the equivalence of political interests that language gets you into trouble , because it 's as much a functional barrier as it is a marker of deep historical division . 
  the eu should just stick to economic union , and let nations have their own domestic policies with some shared immigration and finance controls . 
  a quasi political union is no union at all . 
   that 's a very selective reading of history you have there i mean , since the time the kievan rus ' split into identifiably ukrainian , ruthenian , and russian peoples , ( or maybe it would be better to just fast forward to imperial russia ) , that landmass of russian speaking people under various polities and systems of government have more or less been stomping on all the others - - except for those brief periods where the poles were n't getting wrecked and * they * were conquering people . 
  the dominantly operant history of identifiably `` russian '' and `` ukrainain '' peoples has been one of the former having a stronger nation and warmaking power than the latter , and using it to effectively suppress and contain autonomy . 
   the crimea never had a a very large population of ukrainians ( outside of the khanate 's slaves , if you desperately need to attach a nationality to them pre-19th century ) and , given how often various incarnations of russia have attached nationality or feelings of ownership to `` historically linked '' peoples , yeah , i * would * call them ukrainians on the basis of language and cultural identity . 
  even ignoring them , however , the soviet union straight up * gave crimea to ukraine * as an administrative move . 
  it said `` this is yours '' . 
  then the soviet union ceased to exist . 
  ukraine did n't stop existing , its government and level of sovereignty changed and crimea did n't stop being ukrainian owned . 
  is russia supposed to be able to play ` take-backsies ' on the basis of the ussr 's ` ultimate ' ownership of crimea ( and maybe ukraine as a soviet bound to it ) , is that what we 're all supposed to think ? 
  this is n't like the people responsible for the red army and the soviet nuclear arsenals showing up as the russian federation 's leaders to the unsc because of practical inheritance . 
  this whole mess is a deliberate continuation of the historical domination russia has sought , as united tribes , as a fledgling empire , as a truly imperial/tsarist nation , and as the soviet union , over ` buffer ' territories meant to keep out the percieved enemies of the west - - but with russian federation dressing . 
  look at how russia treats chechnya , look at russia 's interest in armenia/nagorno karabagh and in kazachstan . 
  the history of their conqests in ` the borderlands ' and urals down the volga river is what informs modern day russia 's security policies , because , for better or worse , despite different economic and political models , there is a deep perpetuity of mindset and people among russian speakers born and raised there - - - and it 's one that induces everyone from a mid-50s vatnik who pretends he has some link to the great patriotic/holy war against the dark fascist hordes , to the well dressed and worldly putin to think of ukraine and georgia and kazakhstan and belarus and all the former territories and soviets and borderlands and people as `` theirs '' . 
  it 's disgusting , and it 's plain as day to any outside observer . 
  neither are kazakhs , kyrgyz , or buryat . 
  oh , they 're doing it back , now , but without wars or land purchases . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chronology_of_ukrainian_language_bans https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor because russia tried , and partly succeeded , making their people not exist on those lands , over and over and over again . 
  new strategy ( mexico , take note ) : send lots and lots of immigrants from your country to contiguous area . 
  even better if you can manage keeping them distinct in language and ethnicity . 
  then , once there are enough of them who have crowded out the locals , support them by any means necessary as they agitate for independence from the oppressive natives !, 
  then annex them !, 
  while this is obviously as trivial as matters get , ( then again , we 're responsible for [ this abomination ] ( https://40.media.tumblr.com/b521d5974bfa0d8098822f597cda883f/tumblr_n39jyifbaw1tqsmrzo2_500.jpg ) ) , this is exactly going to be the fate of almost any eu policy from here on out . 
  italy might as well be using the same language for when brussels/other nations slightly north and west of them / say things like `` lol , deal with the mass immigration problem on your own , otherwise you 're not living up * european ideals * ... also we 're going to close our borders '' , and italy finds a lot of non-assimilating people with a different culture and language making up larger and larger numbers . 
  is there a union and will that union concern itself with * every last matter of individual identity * or will there be some boundaries of sovereignty ? 
  it seems absurd , from a us perspective , that the eu would n't seek to * accentuate * and * encourage * the development of as broad a variety of competitive products as possible . 
  the notion that the italians refusing the use of some other nation 's ( or their own ) powedered milk in things legally called ` mozzarella di bufala ' cheese products is `` restricting '' free flow of goods overlooks the extent to which the flow of goods is itself dependent on controls that make those goods distinctive and worthwhile . 
  if italian origin mozzarella cheese were n't any higher in quality ( and it 's already * very higher * ) than some bullshit in a [ some european country without an obsessive cheesemaking culture ] located grocery store aisle , italian exports would suffer , and there 'd be no real benefit to the average non-italian consumer . 
  what 's the point ? 
  perhaps . 
  entry into world markets was why the jumped on nixon 's proposals for them to join the wto - - and they reward it with mass industrial espionage bankrolled by the pla , egregious copy-right infringement on pharmaceutical and intellctual property , and the deliberate undervaluing of their currency to ensure artificially competitive exports , all in contravention of those rules . 
  all of which , however , leads to lots of hard cash income , which they 've mostly directed to military development , scientific research , and infrastructure improvement . 
  the notion that their having debt-based control over an eu member wo n't lead to them attempting to exert soft policy and soft fiscal control over the eu through greek channels is one that just seems naieve to me . 
  even outside the eurozone , an eu member effectively in their pocket would be a huge win - - especially as a nato member ( the reason russia and greece have cynically been making overtures also ) look at a non-eu , non-eurozone , non-nato nation that does n't have great relations with russia * or * committments from the west . 
  would china * ever * express such a heavy interest in ukrainian investment ? 
  belarussian investment ? 
  it 's pretty clear what their goal is . 
  just like `` other bulgaria '' , right ? 
  i guess i 'll have to ; my teachers were all from uruguay and argentina , but i studied in nyc and my spanish speaking friends are mostly mexican/guatemalan/cuban so my accent/vocabulary are all blended and my spanish is janky . 
  thanks for the pointers !, 
  solid , thanks , bro !, 
   the laws of the country it 's operating in . 
  are sometimes retarded and meant to protect against competition . 
   there 's nothing wrong with cheap , fast & good service . 
  agreed . 
   without giving back its share to the society oh look a vague platitude justifying the creation of non-competitive industries and robbing peter to pay paul . 
  i guess this was * totally * unconnected to the massive taxidriver protests , too , right ?
