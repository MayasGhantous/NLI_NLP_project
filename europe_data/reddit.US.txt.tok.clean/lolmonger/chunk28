  just short of outright announcing capital controls . 
  then again , the payment to imf is due on * tuesday * ... http://www.bdlive.co.za/world/europe/2015/06/28/imf-wont-help-greece-if-june-30-payment-not-made-says-lagarde hmmmm . 
   states in the us also give up a huge amount of sovereignty in return and the federal government is allowed to freely operate within the states . 
  ding ding ding [ ** here 's how regional differences in financial demands , but the ultimate sovereignty loss of the states to the federal government is reconciled ** ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/federal_reserve_districts_map_-_banks_%26_branches.png ) [ ** here 's how the political diversity of the states , but their ultimate sovereignty loss to the federal government is reconciled ** ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/us_court_of_appeals_and_district_court_map.svg/2000px-us_court_of_appeals_and_district_court_map.svg.png ) they 're hardly different , and it 's not a coincidence . 
  ** even then ** states can have very different internal policies and taxes and spending priorities , and vastly different ` domestic laws ' . 
  there are just a set of things , from federal law to constitutional boundaries , that they can not politically challenge , and a set of things , from interest rates to lending practices , that they can not financially challenge . 
  our money , and our constitutional law , is american ( federal ) money , and american ( federal ) law . 
  [ yes , california can sell bonds ] ( http://www.buycaliforniabonds.com/ ) [ yes , missouri can make its own laws about fireworks ] ( http://dfs.dps.mo.gov/programs/fireworks/ ) and between being able to ( by the interaction of state and federal law ) be able to fire a grenade launcher mounted on a machinegun in pennsylvania ( highly recommend the experience ) after driving 1 hour and 30 minutes from manhattan in new york where firearms of any kind are nearly banned entirely , there 's lots and lots of domestic law outside finances and regular statute that distinguish the states , and even some of our larger cities . 
  but there is no sovereignty whatsoever . 
  the united states of america is * the * government of the american people , and there is no government pennsylvanians have to challenge it ; it is a state of that government ; there is n't anything like a `` pennsylvania '' citizenship - - there is only residence . 
  ** this ** and nothing less , is what the eu would have to have in order to be a functional policy , monetary , fiscal union and really be a trans-national government and nation . 
  it would require a european identity , a european government , and a european military - - and this would have to be supreme over any individual identity , government , and armed forces of any member state . 
  germany would have to stop being a real country , just as wales is no longer a real country ; there would be a europe , just as there is a united kingdom . 
  france would have to stop being a real country , just as texas is no longer a real country ; there would have to be a europe , just as there are the united states . 
  * that * is what the `` european '' people are going to have to reckon with , as eu nations , as ez nations , as geographically and culturally `` european '' people . 
  no one is making any claims about the racial character of greeks making them an indolent , childish people or whatever . 
  it 's quite clear greeks who are lucky enough to be employed in such a battered economy are working like mad , for very little . 
  but as for the greek voting populace from the years 1990-2005 , i think all younger greeks are owed an apology and asset transfer . 
  that group of people and the politicians they installed ruined the country . 
  syriza has been pretty bad , too . 
  but i do n't think anyone is saying greeks are by some racial quality , less hardworking or intelligent or whatever . 
  anyy greek person aged 25 and below , and who had not voted for unustainable spending , are the people we in the west ( not just europe ) should all mourn for and help . 
  they are * literally * the demographic and political future of greece as a nation , and had largely nothing to do with any of this nonsense . 
  older greeks who voted for all the clientalism in the 90s and 2000s , the people who misrepresented the nation 's finances to join the eu , etc. 
  ** those ** are the people everyone hates ( hopefully those people hate themselves for what they wrought as well ), 
   or someone who irresponsibly lent money see , the thing about greece specifically misrepresenting its actual financial order so that they could join the euro in 2000 ( admitted in 2001 ) was that it was caught kind of late : http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/23/international/europe/23greece.html and from that point onwards , greece * continued * not to make the changes to its economy necessary to start posting better numbers . 
  and then , in a brilliant display of the democracy they invented , greeks chose syriza specifically to fulfill the campaign promise of reneging on terms they were supposed to fulfill as part of their debt bailouts . 
  the imf and ecb do n't give a fuck about `` submission '' . 
  they and pretty much any lender or buyer of debt or whatever pretty much just want greece - - by tuesday - - to pay what they owe , now that it 's clear they wo n't be enacting reforms . 
  and greece , instead , will likely just default on those payments , while still pretending another round of bailouts would help . 
   why are you painting the imf to be the bastion of economic salvation exactly ? 
  why do you imagine the imf is involved in this situation at all ? 
  http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/crislend.htm besides just reading that page over for a * layman explanation * of what the international monetary fund attempts to do , which is the reason they wrote it - - so that everyone can get on the same page regardless of economic background :  the fund has emergency procedures in place to help provide financing at short notice . 
  the emergency financing mechanism was used in 1997 during the asian crisis ; in 2001 for turkey ; in 2008-09 for armenia , georgia , hungary , iceland , latvia , pakistan , and ukraine ; and in 2010 for greece and ireland . 
  that is pretty much their whole purpose . 
  they are there to lend money to nations which desperately need capital influx so they can operate as a real nation and ** put in place the reforms and measures necessary to alleviate what is causing the problems in the first place ** . 
   i think blame squarely rests on the imf and lagarde for their inability to support a more redistributive program . 
  it was their inability to have any flexibility which was the final straw for the greeks . 
  how many bailouts is enough ? 
  how long a delay of payment is enough ? 
  if the people trying to help you are telling you to make changes that * they believe will result in your ability to pay them back and not get in trouble again * , retorting with `` well , but if we do this we wo n't be able to pay you back , you just want us to feel bad and suffer !, 
  '' , who is the party negotiating in bad faith , tell me ? 
   syriza 's red lines . 
  get to be maintained now . 
  i hope the greeks who voted for them and supported them twice over , understand now at least what happened . 
   the debt is unsustainable . 
  because of greek governments ' , and greek voters ' which installed those governments , decision making about pensions , about public employment , and about tax policy/collection/evasion , and defense spending choices , and because of deliberately misrepresenting ( i.e. 
  lying ) about the state of greece 's finances to join the eurozone . 
  * that * is why there is a problem . 
  it 's not the european union 's fault ( what did romania and slovenia have to do with this ? ), 
  as a policy union , nor is it the imf 's fault ( after all the help they 've delivered so many countries as * the * last resort lender over and over again , including greece , now that they could not be paid back , * they 're * at fault ? ) . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/opinion/the-cost-of-protecting-greeces-public-sector.html?_r=0 oct. 10 , 2012  every political party , whether in the coalition government or in opposition , fears the consequences of losing the support of a voting bloc of more than 700,000 government employees and their families . 
  the greek population in 2012 was 11.09 million . 
   greece 's creditors -- the troika comprised of the european commission , the european central bank and the international monetary fund -- have made public-sector layoffs a condition for providing the next tranche of the biggest bailout in history . 
  but political pressure remains fierce . 
  * many analysts say that the newfound strength of syriza , the formerly fringe leftist group that is now the main opposition party in parliament , came as support eroded for the governing coalition that is trying to reform greece . 
  * http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17986065 8 may 2012  the leader of greece 's left-wing syriza bloc has said he will try to form a coalition based on tearing up the terms of the eu/imf bailout deal . 
   alexis tsipras , whose bloc came second in sunday 's vote , said greek voters had `` clearly nullified the loan agreement '' . 
   under greece 's current bailout plan , billions of euros in further austerity cuts will have to be found in june - and the country is also counting on a 30bn euro ( # 24bn ; $ 39bn ) instalment in eu/imf funds 25 january 2015 http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/jan/25/greek-election-syriza-confident-of-victory-live-updates  a triumphant alexis tsipras told greeks that his radical left syriza party 's win in meant an end to austerity and humiliation and that the country 's regular and often fraught debt inspections were a thing of the past . 
   `` the sovereign greek people today have given a clear , strong , indisputable mandate . 
  greece has turned a page . 
  greece is leaving behind the destructive austerity , fear and authoritarianism . 
  it is leaving behind five years of humiliation and pain , '' tsipras said to a crowd of rapturous flag-waving party supporters . 
   the 40-year-old tsipras campaigned on promises of renegotiating the terms for greece 's $ 240 billion-euro bailout , which has kept the debt-ridden country afloat since mid-2010 . 
  ** that ** is the time line up 'til recent events . 
  and just in case you forgot : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4012869.stm 15 november , 2004  greece has admitted it joined the euro in 2001 on the basis of figures that showed its budget deficit to be much lower than it really was . 
   i think all people deserve to have their own nation what happens if people who are culturally and linguistically separate were historically populated into an area by a larger power they belonged to ? 
  it 's not like russian speaking ethnically russian people were ` native ' to latvia . 
  does the land become * theirs * then , once there are enough of them , and can that new country annex to russia ? 
  that 's more or less what happened with texan whites , overwhelming the local spanish , then mexican populace , and getting tacked onto the usa . 
  what will occur when the massive illegal immigration and hispano/spanish speaking majority results in a separate `` people '' in the us southwest ? 
  do they get to secede ? 
  what constitutes a `` people '' for the sake of having their own nation ? 
  and do we want to assume this is independent of the nation they 're in doing right by them in terms of representation and treatment ? 
   there 's just something distasteful about relentlessly pounding someone who 's been down for 14 years . 
  yeah , like someone whose money you borrowed , spent , and wo n't pay back . 
  could n't tell you . 
  any large city will be tilted left socially/have lots of young people / have large employers who require it services and consulting . 
  we have dozens and dozens and dozens of ` cities ' outside the definition of 1 + million inhabitants and large metropolitan areas . 
  no , do n't you see ? 
  he put ` corporation ' and ` democracy ' together , and that explains his whole position !, 
  a european union will work when policy , finance , and defense are linked * because the people no longer view themselves as different * within the eu . 
  alabama does n't * always * have to have the same laws as connecticut - but sometimes federal courts can say so . 
  alabama * always * has the same defense policy as connecticut . 
  their national guard units may perform non-emergency duties and civil emergency response to their own people , but for protecting/attacking , they are federalized , and their commander in chief changes from the state governor to the us president . 
  financially , they both use us dollars , administered by the treasury department and federal reserve . 
  on fiscal policy , their governments have their own budgets , but there is never the possibility of bankruptcy - only the promise of a state 's voters throwing out a state administration for making poor spending commitments . 
  the federal reserve manages the entire currency and banking system . 
  on trade policy , there are only very narrow ways in which either can do business with a foreign entity as states ; decisions are ultimately federal . 
  they are n't quite provinces of a centralized nation , they certainly are n't independent nations in any sense . 
  this is the level of sovereignty loss eu member nations will have to accede to if the eu/ez is to be more than a trade union , with linked fiscal/monetary policy . 
  an alabaman and a person born and raised in connecticut have very different identities and cultures as southerners and new englanders . 
  but there 's hardly a difference between these two americans and their concern for american interests as there is between a german and a greek talking about `` european '' matters . 
  that 's my fundamental worry about the eu . 
  as a coal and steel commission , i think it works well . 
  as a trade union , i think it works well . 
  as a policy/monetary/fiscal union ( with the battlegroups hinting at true national union ) it does n't seem to work very well , because these are all fundamentally separate people , separate nations . 
  i do n't see how 20 + languages and national histories and ethnicities are supposed to be cohesive unless you give them a common tongue and several generations of interbreeding and a national history of fighting for survival and then expanding as a single people . 
  plus , is that really what spaniards and slovenes and belgians and estonians want ? 
  yeah , because the laws that said `` no guns allowed ! '',
