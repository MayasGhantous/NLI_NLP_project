  sure stopped all those mass shooters !, 
  every time there is a mass shooting , people call police with guns . 
  in norway , in america , everywhere . 
  people who have gone through the permit check process to carry a firearm for their own protection and ability to fight back should n't have to give that up when they 're in a college classroom . 
  i dunno , if america was hurting badly , i 'd want to make sure for my children 's generation or the one after , it was better . 
  the country you were born in is still * your * country , right ? 
  then again , we 've all had so much provided to us by americans past . 
  if we had had decades of terrible leaders installed by previous generations who put lots and lots of burdens on us , i 'm sure most would feel differently . 
  if the police can kill an innocent guy from brazil on the tube wearing an out of season jacket after the 7/7 attacks , the government can easily ` mess up ' with mass private data collection . 
   you do realise the french have been burning cars and store fronts in riots for decades before any immigration ? 
  yeah , but look at how much time passed since they were last beheading people . 
  do you see the problem ? 
  is this making anything clearer ? 
  god bless you teutons and your sense of ordnung . 
   i 'm more talking about the idea that the right ( and espcially far-right ) have about culture is that it is a monogamous unchanging thing that should n't be influenced by anything . 
  i do n't think that 's what they 're about . 
  i think they enjoy using cellphones and having modern medicine and communicating with their followers on twitter . 
  what they * do n't * like is when the influences to their nation 's culture are things like islamists beheading people and putting their severed head on display . 
   the idea that french culture is being destroyed by immigration is nonsense . 
  the idea that the culture of france now needs to police itself and be aware that burning cars and store fronts , or islamists shooting up offices and streets and beheading people because of cultural tensions ** is n't ** nonsense . 
  it 's happened . 
   anglo indians are a totally different ethnicity found in india . 
  oh , i 'm not disputing that - - - that 's exactly what i 'm talking about ; a lot of * them * were the people that first started immigrating ` back ' to the uk ( which is partly why their numbers are n't so large in india anymore ) literally anglo/deccan hybrids in culture and racial character ; that 's why i think further indian immigration to britain ( including for reasons of historical link ) was so easy . 
   the whole idea of `` cultural integrity '' is a right-wing thing that 's honestly total nonsense . 
  right , the western amalgam of social norms and respect for life is an illusory social construct hardly distinct from the notions of jihad against the kuffar who offend allah swt and his prophet mohammed , peace be upon him , which motivated this beheading . 
  left is right , green is red , up is down and all possible distinctions that can be made of ` us ' and ` them ' are make-believe and nothing bad happened as a result of people with values that prescribe cutting someone 's head off in an act of religious warfare being present inside france . 
  this whole thread is n't happening , this is a dream within a dream . 
  i do n't believe that 's what she 'd advocate . 
  i think she is actually different from her father , and while she may not have the refined sensibilities of parisians who refuse to call out actions like this motivated by a * widespread * school of islamic thought , she is n't necessarily racist or bigoted . 
  then again , as a brown skinned , religious minority , immigrants ' kid myself , i want us to cut down on immigration to the us too , particularly so our culture and society stays orderly as well . 
  so i guess i hate brown people or something . 
  we ca n't just keep shouting down every possible right of center notion about national identity and cultural integrity as * rayciss * and evil , or eventually you 'll find the moderates who are uncomfortable and quiet will start standing with the * actually * unreasonable portions of the polity , and * then * there will be real trouble . 
  herp derp le pen is a nazi !!, 
  ! 11 okay , good , now that anyone saying anything bad about immigrants has been shouted down as a nazi , i 'm sure the problems will be solved !, 
  take it from me - the thing to do is respond by deliberately not allowing your politicians who failed you on immigration policy be the same people who now tell you all will be solved with just a * little * more power over you . 
  the issue is the islamists , the non-assimilating immigrants , the beheaders . 
  they are the problem - not the typical french person 's ability to live a life without surveillance . 
  we 're busy dismantling our first , second , third , and fourth amendment liberties in the us all under the schema of a few people 's abuses becoming a justification for the government to take away the people 's inherent freedom . 
  all the while they do little to actually punish those responsible , and address root causes . 
  do n't let it get crazy like we did post-patriot act . 
  same deal with us , brother . 
  all of latin america that wants to do it illegally and claim public benefits from schooling to drivers licenses can , but graduate students from abroad have to worry about visa renewal instead of finding jobs and having kids here . 
  1 ) misspelling a foreign name 2 ) to sell things 3 ) the thing is icecream ~ ` murica ~, 
  if greece leaves the euro , you can kiss the euro and eu goodbye . 
  it would be fatal to the political validity of the eu , and the financial credit of the euro . 
  it would n't happen overnight , but an `` exit '' would then be an option ( a severe one , but a real one ) for other distressed members in the unequal system that is the eu/ez . 
  if a union is to exist , it must exist when dysfunction occurs , and take steps to help members suffering , or else it is n't a union at all . 
   j\u00e1sir arafat this seems even weirder than when people write jeltsin . 
  * obviously * texas would win . 
  [ california does stuff like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zurqewgj91u ) [ texans do stuff like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phlzn18jfv0 ), 
   indian immigration from the 1950s to be fair , this was largely driven by the immigration of those indians best poised to move from what was very recently a subordinate state of the commonwealth ( and which had been for * quite * some time ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-indian we got some of them , too , but the great majority simply went to the uk - - not even just culture ; ethnic and linguistic integration was already in the works long before they were arriving . 
  that was what gave them such a boost in integrating into english custom ; like the irish and scots before them , the english had basically basically begun the process long before there was to be any consideration of them as a foreign people coming into the fold . 
  with the poles , as a brown immigrant 's kid to a white society , i 'd chalk their assimilation speed up to the fact that in one generation , you get people with the same skin color learning the language natively with the right accent and a religion ( if that influence is even present at all in modern times ) that 's basically just a forked version of the native one . 
  now , i 'm not saying this sort of thing ( prior historical relationship , existing similarity ) should drive * all * immigration policy ; it 's not like the us has n't benefitted from having east asians show up or anything , but it 's a factor . 
  contrasting the situation of indians ( largely hindu , plenty anglicized ) forming a large immigrant base , the circumstances of muslims from pakistan emigrating in large numbers beginning in the 1980s to the uk presents a very different prospect : not the same race , not the same cultural notions , and a * very * strong set of * vastly * different religious norms . 
  it should n't be * too * much of a surprise there 's a problem with some groups of south asian immigrants to the uk , and no issue with the other ones . 
  not all immigrants are created equal , if the quality of assimilation is being seriously looked at . 
  if texas seceded , it would proceed to annex the rest of the states , and we 'd be the united states of texas . 
  california would be out doing its own thing with hawaii , though . 
  alaska can come too . 
   they 're facing one of the world 's most powerful countries and their allies seem to be turning a blind eye on the whole situation [ ** well , i mean ... ** ] ( http://www.youtubedoubler.com/?video1=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3do75r3wutwlk&amp;start1=&amp;video2=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dihnugaaea4m&amp;start2=&amp;authorname=snoopsagan ), 
  so now think about how poland 's defense planners feel , as germany more or less wo n't meet mutual defense obligations and the rest of western europe is mostly just only willing to extend some nominal sanctions . 
  i 'd imagine the median age is somewhere around 55 for their upper tier officers and politicians . 
  they likely all have parents and grandparents brutalized by the soviets and nazis . 
  as an american , i demand an apology from tesco for selling vegan/vegetarian `` bacon '' products . 
  what the fuck . 
  poland is on track to meet the nato 2 % obligation with a modernized force in the next few years . 
  they 'll have an up to date military , armor and air hardware , and be carrying their burden . 
  germany just does n't care . 
  that has great accents and delicious food and smoking hot women, 
  100 shekels says it 's a saudi minor royalty funding it , and it will promote salafist/wahabi sunni islam and be tilted in favor of saudi arabs over other ethnicities . 
  would take a little more than a single russian federation soldier physically intruding in the borders of a nato nation , but , more or less , putin is doing everything he can to sow internal doubt about article 5 . 
  it 's not like there is some determinastic mechanism whereby the nations allied to one attacked rush to its defense . 
  they have to choose to honor the treaty . 
  i 'd imagine russia is giddy over how germany has been acting while estonia/latvia/lithuania freak out . 
  it makes those smaller nations lose faith . 
  that 's pretty much why the us sent over a small force of tanks and some trainers to the baltics and ukraine . 
  everyone knows what the american people 's bloodlust would be like if russians killed us troops without provocation . 
  our policy makers would n't have to convince the electorate or legislature for approval , all our angst about fighting moral wars would come unhinged , `` burn moscow to the ground '' and all that . 
  but without this kind of surety , there 's a good chance the alliance simply goes * poof * when challenged . 
  then it would be open season on smaller nations . 
  this is why russia has to saber rattle against bigger nations , and more idyllic ones at that . 
  * their * joining nato or taking bigger roles would mean the entry of very expensive lives to take . 
  the western public has n't been too upset by ukrainian lives lost , nor georgian lives lost . 
  america would go ballistic ( actually tho ) over us lives taken by russia , and likely , not even germany and france could ignore swedes being killed . 
  if estonian and latvian lives are lost ? 
  if the eu was n't prepared to help out ukraine , and those same nations as nato members are n't willing to press russia , either ... maybe not all `` european '' lives have the same worth to europeans . 
  and if that 's true , if all but the us as nato members are european , maybe not all nato members are worth the same either . 
  putin is deliberately pushing against the paperworks of western polity with his actions , much as securing russian geopolitical interests and means . 
  he 's challenging what it means to be europe , to be an eu nation , to be in nato , etc. 
  he 's directly challenging the post-cold war order . 
   it 's because your people are bred to be soldiers less than 0.5 percent of the us population serves in the military . 
   we can spend our money on more useful things , like health care and education nasa , having the top research universities , leading in real patent and scientific research output , the most nobel laureates , and being the premier nation for aviation and aerospace and telecommunications and information technologies industries all point to europe more or less being stagnant . 
  also , seriously , you 're from * the netherlands * . 
  like , even within europe , your nation is n't a leader . 
  but yeah , write up a reply to me as best you can manage in my native language and send it on this us website . 
  they obviously want a better life , and are getting one ; they 're not in the shithole country they came from , and they 're taking the stuff of people who built a nicer country than they did , and no one is stopping them . 
  their lives are materially improving by dint of their actions . 
  or czechs,
