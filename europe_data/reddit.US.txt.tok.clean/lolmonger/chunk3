  by land , sea , or air , it is a difficult thing . 
  having forward located bases whose importance before was russia in the event of invasion does n't stop being irrelevant if you think * you * wo n't be invaded . 
  what if russia does something to poland ? 
  to romania ? 
  if article 5 is invoked , will germany be able to logistically contribute even ? 
  basically , the german argument is `` russia just wants the ~ ~ sudetenland ~ ~ crimean peninsula '' and that any kind of larger preparatory spending is a waste . 
  it totally undercuts nato unity . 
  will it be uplifting when germany does n't have the logistics ability to train , arm , and make battle ready troops , armor , and materiel to meet nato obligations ? 
  oh wait , * if * they do that ? 
  the romanians , poles , estonians , latvians , and lithuanians should ** not ** be looking toward a nation not even on their own continent , not even part of economic and political `` union '' with them ( that 's an eu flag in your flair right ? 
  what do you think it means ? ), 
  when their security situation is compromised , when a nation which has brutalized them in the recent past brutalizes a fellow european nation and neighbor and trading partner . 
  military bases into wildlife reserves , no serious arms industry replacement for the g36 , broom stick machine guns , next to no public support for militarily backing poland , nordstream 2 , etc. 
  the germans political leadership has become soft , cowardly , and self serving on `` eu '' economic , military , and political issues , and yet deigns to supervise it because of their economic power . 
  how long does that persist with refugee costs right on the heels of reunification costs ? 
  and political capital burnt on greece ? 
  and the instability of their currency ? 
   advocating for illegal immigration directly is politically-damaging for the democratic party , because the public does n't want that , good deal of it does want much more lax rules , and amnesty , because of the mixed family issue and the tremendous growth of latinos as a voting-determinant population . 
   that 's not hypocritical , as it would be compatible with this not saying it is , just pointing out the same dynamic ; the responses people are having are n't novel or anything - they should be expected . 
  feminism has pussified the west and taken away the ability to take hardline aggressive policy decisions for the sake of responsibility and integrity , etc. 
   murica !, 
  learning world history and geography , one crisis at a time !, 
  we usually do it through war , so , uh - - progress !, 
   i 'm a bit embarrassed about the new york times constantly pumping out stories condemning europe -- and in particular eastern europe -- with nary a call for the us to take in a comparable number of refugees . 
  just look at their attitudes towards illegal immigration and border states which try to stop it . 
  i want to see a chechen-serb matchup . 
  like , all the grit of grozny against the best belgrade has to offer . 
  jihadists vs chetniks . 
  professional paramilitary troops on each side , former soviet equipment and arms , no surrender , one victor . 
  we clear out a swathe of land and build a wall around them , and have drone footage . 
  i 'd pay to watch that live stream . 
  the best of example of this is barack obama lecturing americans about not being too strident in their criticism of the professed religion of isis because , you know , the crusades happened . 
  with a straight face , he `` called out '' and gave americans a stern talking-to . 
  as though america 's christians should be taken to task for the medieval theocracies of europe waging war centuries ago when they react to news of people beheading and raping in the name of god contemporary to privatized space flight in their own nation . 
  the left wing has no idea how to stand up for anything because it 's created such a cultish attitude of degeneracy where all cultures and religions and view points are indistinguishably valuable and important . 
  `` discrimination '' is a sin - believing in one 's culture 's superiority an act of aggression . 
  my chief complaint with their dialectical thinking is how easy it is for people to see everything in an oppressor-oppressed lens . 
  to borrow their words , it 's * problematic * . 
  neither isis nor bashir al-assad 's regime are particularly great . 
  but now all who worshipped at the altar of madeline albright and joseph nye at in academician run temples of policy have ** no idea ** what to do . 
  western governments have no way to even talk about these problems to the public . 
  the intelligentsia do n't know how to talk about it among themselves . 
  the media can do nothing but show us vile images because there 's no narrative of solutions to publicize . 
  then they invite swarms of anyone looking to get out without even thinking about what it means for the future of their own precious welfare states . 
  the ouroboros is hungry , and retarded . 
  nah , english orthography has all the comparative morphology and etymology baked into it . 
  everyone else speaks it and spells it mostly well enough to get it anyway . 
  feels nice , right ? 
  you ultimately won , at least on language . 
  the ethnic composition of parts of the country could come to reflect minority status for the current majority ethnicity . 
  might be limited to parts of cities , whole districts , entire states . 
  they may form parallel language communities , and you 'll hear/see this separate culture more and more prominently in government/safety/advertising communications ( dclauzel style ) if they do live parallelly , they 'll come to be an ethnic/linguistic bloc with their own interests and politics that do n't reflect the previous electoral balance , and with loyalty to whichever party got them in for decades . 
  this has basically been the experience of the us with latinos post 1965 and acutely post 1986 . 
   medias are lying to us !, 
  actually , media in english is n't countable like this . 
  it 's a collective , the sentence should be : ` the media is lying to us ! ', 
  but , you did n't say something like , ` the medias to us they lie !, 
  ' , which i 've seen some spanish and french speakers do . 
  good job !, 
  also , in the first sentence , it should be ` exposes ' since you 're using channel in the singular . 
  good thing there 's no translation , so no one understands it and closes it after two seconds . 
  yah , along with sensible people , virulent racists also oppose mass immigration . 
  it 's possible to support policies which are not racist/awful for racist/awful reasons . 
  if the priorities of the very worst people colored all political objectives in that way , there 'd be no position anyone could take without being depraved by crime of association . 
   oh lord ... are you serious ? 
  your toys wo n't help you against government with drones , tanks , missles etc. 
  1 ) who do you think joins the us military ? 
  where do you think their sympathies lie ? 
  2 ) `` simple colonists ca n't defeat the british empire ! '', 
  3 ) vietnam , afghanistan , iraq , syria , libya , egypt , etc. 
  4 ) the point is not to have a pitched war between the ( somehow not fractured and deserting/rebelling ) army and the people - - it is to make the cost of any action that could locally cause armed insurrection to be globally costly . 
  5 ) remember when the greek government kept beating down on protesters as their politicians traded the future of the country away over and over ? 
  you ca n't really beat people with batons if they 've got rifles and pistols as well . 
  ** the common people being armed takes away brute force as an attractive option for the government . 
   i do n't know anyone that want a gun here in france except hunters . 
  they post on / r/guns sometimes , and they do n't have ` hunting ' rifles . 
  ( still very jealous of the parisian poster with a proper cz 805 bren rifle who did n't have to bother with getting a shitty pretend stock or deal with a stupid long barrel )  the gun laws might be different , but the gun boner is very strong in the us , not in france . 
  yes , people do more often own firearms in the us than in france . 
   at least for germany that 's flat out wrong . 
  it is basically impossible to get a licence that will allow you to carry a gun on you . 
  was talking about types of ownership there , but , yes , that is true . 
  in addition to many , many foreign firearms : http://www.schmeisser-germany.de/ger/produkte_sportundjagd.html http://www.oberlandarms.com/produkte-infos-rifles--de--oa+selbstladeb%fcchsen+rifles.html y' all even have domestic manufacture options !, 
    , and many americans will never legally be able to own what people in france and germany can . 
   i would be very interested to hear what that is . 
  new york state , california , new jersey each have onerous restrictions on what kinds of firearms and what configuration they can be in , and nyc has total bans on several named firearms , as do chicago and d.c. 
  these do n't exist in germany . 
  german gun owners i know have izhevsk mechanical works origin kalashnikovs , ar-15s , czs , fns , etc. 
  http://www.thelocal.de/20130217/48015 ^ lots of germans own guns . 
   no to mention the open fetish many americans have for guns - very disturbing . 
  how about the fetish germans have for slaughtering jewish men , women and children by the millions along with mentally handicapped people and those they deem racially unworthy of life ? 
  see , i can do it too !, 
  sure , and with 300 + million firearms in the hands of 100 million americans , there are only about 12k instances of unlawful actions with them each year , and almost zero percent of the time were those firearms in the possession of that person lawfully . 
  with the most recent count being 11208 murders by firearm , there 's a 0.003736 percent chance any individual firearm is going to be used to commit a crime . 
  ( hint : it 's not an even or normal distribution in reality ! ), 
  frankly , the overwhelming majority of millions and millions of gun owners for decades have simply treated their firearms and communities with respect . 
  it 's been something that 's defined our nation and its policies about security and invidual rights and the limits of government power since our founding . 
  that several thousand people in the inner cities each year commit violence against one another out of poverty and occasionally a deranged person will abuse the access to firearms normal people enjoy simply is n't enough for us to start curtailing what we view as a fundamental distinction between a free people and servile people . 
  the culture and attitude are actually really sober about the whole thing ; not prone to abuse , nor liable to support restrictions . 
  buy lots of 75s and 805 brens !, 
  \u010cesk\u00e1 zbrojovka is way beyond heckler & koch for me .
