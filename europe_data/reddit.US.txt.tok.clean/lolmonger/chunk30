  larger employers ( 50 + by law now , usually higher than that before the ppaca ) offer their own health insurance programs in conjunction with a large insurer that they are mandated to offer to their employees ( who can shop around for other policies ) . 
  furthermore , full time employees and employers have fica imposed ; the tax on payroll ( technically distinct from * all * income , or capital gains and dividends ) that goes to funding social security and medicare . 
  so , the employer spends some of its money on a policy ( most do n't create their own internal pools and insurance schedules , they leave that to a professional insurance agency , though it 's a possibility ) to which employees are offered a spot . 
  some employers will simply pay their workers differently because of this compensation they 're mandated to offer , others will specifically ask their employees ( even paying them more ) to shop around and reduce company liability so they can legally comply but not buy an expensive plan , etc. 
  fica though , is unavoidable for businesses and employees , who must pay an equal share to the federal government to fund ss and medicare . 
  money you actually take home = income - taxes : = investment dividends + capital gains + employed pay + contracted income - dividends taxes - capital gains taxes - payroll taxes - income taxes there are state and federal ( and sometimes local ! ), 
  components to all of these , different percentages and deductions for each , and even different credits based on other financial situations ( dependents , expenses , etc ) , but suffice to say the us tax code is pretty convoluted . 
  this is already grossly simplified and incomplete as a picture . 
  eh , they kind of have to say this sort of thing , as much for their audience at home as for the world 's press . 
  when the us threw down jupiter class missiles in turkey ( too slow even in that era to be * response * missiles , just fast enough to start a first strike ) as `` missile defense '' the russians knew what was going on and so plunked their own nukes in cuba , not so long after the us 's attempted invasion . 
  it 's not like us rhetoric about that at the time was `` oh , yeah , i guess that 's fair , you guys '' . 
  russia 's invasion and annexation of parts of ukraine is n't identical for various reasons , but that their response to a us led effort to resurrect some missile defense deployment s ( not in poland , though . 
  too bad that did n't happen ) is to be all ` yo , this means you 're part of what we nuke if things go bad ' is n't unreasonable . 
  it 's just that the precipitating event is unreasonable . 
  good . 
  there 's a very easy way not to be shot while breaking into someone else 's home , and it 's rather tilted towards not being in someone else 's home , and not the homeowner lacking the ability to shoot . 
   as an european , i 'm glad for the things he did . 
  i do n't feel obligated about american interests particularly our security interests ** are ** your security interests , nearly entirely . 
  there is no european cia or dod or nsa . 
  there is no european navy . 
  there is no european air force . 
  there is no european nuclear command . 
  there is nato , which is the us , and that 's pretty much * it * . 
  only very rarely does this sort of thing happen in modern times . 
  when our nation imported chinese and irish by the boatload ( truly !, 
  ) , we were still largely a frontier nation , and concurrent with our need for mass labor to construct the railroads and settle the west , we had a immigrant base willing to do it . 
  they , despite not being acceptable to the anglo-base , assimilated and became us , and today , it would be ridiculous for a person not to see how the irish-americans are simply whites ( and hardly irish ) and how chinese-americans are ( either as long time residents or immigrants ) a wealthy and driven addition to our nation . 
  they 're all just americans now . 
  but it 's not like the us is a frontier nation still , with lots of capacity to be filled because of under utilization . 
  we would be * poorly * served by massive immigration of low skilled labor from china ( or ireland , though that nation is largely developed and does n't have nearly the numbers of impoverished people now ) . 
  all mass immigration of people gets us now is additions to the welfare roles and token tax collection from sales and property taxes . 
  neither the us nor europe should be accommodating of economic migrants ; they 've plenty of their own native poor , whether they be racially diverse poor americans or racially singular poor germans or italians or spaniards or whatever - - - developed nations should look out for their own before they help others or else the purpose of the nation-state , a stable and secure entity to promote economic bounty , is being ignored . 
  there are plenty of people who do without in all the eu 's nations . 
  if housing is a problem and there are to be public works projects to solve that , putting the natives to work and bringing them into the economic and property owning fold seems to be the better choice than bringing immigrants who need to be educated and assimilated and crowd out native people who are struggling . 
  oh man , i thought dimsum was strictly hong kong/chinese and korean . 
  damn . 
  tapas , tacos , and burger is dead giveaway for spain , mexican , american , though . 
  entre el americano , or quisas la iberico ? 
  anywhoo - - - our heritage latino population is fine , both the spaniard to cuban and spaniard to mexican varieties . 
  also , tex-mex food is still killer . 
  we need supplements to : poles in chicago , italians in jersey and nyc , scotch-irish in appalachia , teutons in pennsylvania and the midwests , and scandinavians out to minnesota . 
  probably also chinamen in california and japanese people in hawaii . 
  we could use some more african stock in the south as well , they 're not growing fast enough . 
  then we need to work on resurrecting some of the native base , and we 'll be set . 
  ... have to have all the sets ... must have all the versions of humanity ... 
  how about this : y' all and the irishmen send us all your country drunks and farmers ; to tennessee , mississippi , alabama , arkansas , the carolinas , the virginias , and kentucky . 
  they 'll revitalize the flavor of european we originally transplanted there . 
  revitalized bluegrass and country worked out from all your folk music and a liquor tradition from your celtic/brythonic alcoholism . 
  it 'll be like you guys cutting the deadweight , and a shot in the arm for our demographic trends . 
  a large influx of immigrants to the cities to compete for entry-level and unskilled labor jobs and housing should do the trick !, 
  while i detest the notion of :  special class of people with magic governing skills , there 's something to be said for the pursuit of technocrats . 
  it 's probably a good thing that [ this guy was our secretary of energy policy ] ( http://www.energy.gov/contributors/dr-steven-chu ) and probably a [ bad thing that this guy was tasked with regulating the internet in any way ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/series_of_tubes ) notice , though , one of those guys was appointed and then approved by officials ; twice separated from the elections of the president and senate . 
  the other was directly chosen by the voters of the geographical area he represents . 
  i 'm not so sure either lotteries or voting or pulling a stone out of a sword or whatever can really , at the end of the day , ameliorate the fundamental issue of societies that are too comfortable with delegating problem solving and authority to other people , when they know they hate being ruled over by other people . 
  it 's a delicate balance ; should the 80 something percent turnout of the icelandic electorate and resulting gains by the pirate party give them a mandate ? 
  should 51 people be able to piss in the cornflakes of 49 ? 
  do we leave everything to voting ? 
  and when we do , what if people do n't show up , like in the us ? 
  on and on this goes , but the basic issue always comes down to the quality of the people and society that a nation is made of ; if they 're good people and * responsible * people , by and large , things will work out okay because they wo n't tolerate despotism in the name of progress , nor disrepair in the name of freedom . 
   people need to learn that there are differences in cultures which often means it 's a bad idea to mix them without care . 
  this requires unlearning the lessons of academia ; that all cultures are equally worthy of perpetuity and representation - - except western cultures , which are oppressive and have to make amends for historical injustice through allowing physical access and monetary access to their people 's land and welfare to inheritors of other cultures, 
  no , i can appreciate , at least for germany , that it would be a cultural and structural challenge . 
  even if the issue of tanks , airplanes , ships , and missiles was all taken care of , how do you motivate people to join the military ? 
  young germans are n't the most nationalistic of people , but its not like anyone looks at an eu/nato flag and gets misty eyed , either . 
  and the hardware issue * is n't * solved , germany 's military is in pretty sad shape . 
  ** but ** in 25 years of reintegration with the east ( following such a brutal result of the wars ) and no real wage growth to compensate for all the dead weight being added on and all the taxpayer funding of the ecb , the german people are simply very educated , very productive , and very politically aware people . 
  it 's a strong nation , and it should be a leader on all issues ; economy , immigration , defense . 
  those three areas where the eu is lagging , german should take charge . 
  it just also should n't be alone , france ought so much the same . 
  sure , we could win , but it would almost certainly incur terrible losses . 
  that 's the problem . 
  that anyone could want to start a war to annex territory in 2014 , as a nuclear power , is actually pretty scary . 
  only the pakistanis and indians as mutual nuclear powers fighting over land would be scarier . 
  no one does . 
  it 's the will to start one that 's the issue . 
  in terms of men and materiel and money , there was no way germany , japan , and italy could 've beaten the us , ussr , and uk . 
  they had to get down to putting 14 year olds in uniforms and flying piloted bombs into ships by the end of the war , while the ussr was flooding their nation with troops and the us was developing and using humanity 's first nuclear weapons , all while the brits and poles essentially revolutionized information theory and cryptographic process . 
  and it 's not like china had some significant dearth of people to fight even back then . 
  there was just no way they could 've won , but - - their aggression had to be answered . 
  the war had to happen and millions of lives had to be brutalized and lost all because of people like stalin and hitler and tojo and mussolini , and their hubristic notions of supermen and destiny and nationalistic bullshit backing up their desire to take other people 's shit . 
  that 's the reason putin is terrifying . 
  the baltics and eastern european economies are doing all they can . 
  a lot of them only quite recently came out of communism/warsaw pact/comecon and do n't have the population base or economic strength they would 've had if they were n't savaged by the second world war and the command economy model . 
  and even * then * estonia is meeting a two percent of gdp target , even * then * poland is on track to do so with modern equipment , even * then * lithuania and latvia are hosting nato centers . 
  the czechs are n't exactly slouching in terms of labor force commitment to defense either . 
  the eastern nations are doing what they can . 
  it 's hardly the fault of decision makers and soldiers and workers aged 50 and below that so much bullshit was visited on their nations by the designs of the nazis and then the soviets . 
  it 's western europe with its trade and geographic isolation from problems that does n't care . 
  italy , spain and portugal are n't exceptional economies , but they 're not financial weaklings . 
  france and germany clearly have the cash and technological prowess to do more but wo n't . 
  some northern european nations really punched above their weight in libya , and robert gates commended them , but they can do more too . 
  germany should really be taking a leadership role , and if it were to do so , maybe it could mean a greek drawdown in defense spending and a focus on being economically solvent again . 
  it 'd be good for nato and good for the euro/eu . 
  more than 30 million kurds and no kurdistan . 
  barely 400,000 icelanders and there is an iceland . 
  territorial integrity and state matter to the independence of a culture and language and people . 
  poland is actually making significant investments in their defenses , and will meet the 2 % obligation ( with * modern * equipment and troops ! ), 
  soon enough . 
  the nation is a model for economic recovery after communism ( really post comecon ) and a model nato partner . 
  it 's like south korea in central europe .
