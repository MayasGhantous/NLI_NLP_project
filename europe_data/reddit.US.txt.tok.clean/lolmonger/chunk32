  ` sides i propitiate agni when i bother praying . 
  trimurti conceptions of deity are puranic innovations . 
   if i 'd burn an american flag in front of a lot of americans it 's not like i just burned a random piece of cloth . 
  nope , but if you were in the us , it 'd be perfectly legal , and specifically protected by the very first law of our republic whose symbol you burned , * for exactly the reason that you 're communicating severe political ideas * . 
  this is the distinction between western values ( and frankly , us protections of individual political freedom vs. europe 's ) and islamic notions of jurisprudence . 
  it 's not like people * do n't * get how offensive it is to muslims to depict mohammed or whatever . 
  that 's besides the point . 
  the point is islam should n't expect to have its dictate overrule western society 's secularism , and there 's no justification at all for the killing some of its schools prescribe as retribution for being offended . 
   enjoy this lovely , and highly nsfw onion article as a hindu , they were lazy with a bi-sexed ganesh . 
  could 've taken advantage of a brahman with many faces and mouths , or a saraswati with multiple arms . 
   norways gun laws were fairly lax by european standards at the time . 
  for starters , they did n't have a ban on semi-autos or handguns either . 
  and neither does the czech republic . 
  neither do france or germany , and other european nations . 
  / r/guns gets plenty of posters from france and germany who own things * people in new york state can not * . 
   there 's a reason your gun murder rates are ten times higher . 
  because we have a large number of cities , unlike europe , and those cities are populated by an underclass of people that our history subjugated into centuries long economic poverty and societal exclusion , and the drug laws we have create long term jail sentences and economic deprivation for them , leading to crime . 
  chicago , baltimore , d.c. , philadelphia , new orleans , the bronx etc. 
  these are the murder capitals of the united states . 
  you know where is n't ? 
  vermont . 
  look at vermont 's gun laws : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_laws_in_vermont look at what it takes to carry a concealed handgun in public places . 
  literally nothing ; yet they do n't have crime , because people there have had for generations , long term economic futures and societal integration denied to millions and millions of people in the united states on the basis of historical racial discrimination and poverty . 
  ** that 's ** the issue ; not legal access to firearms . 
  our gun crime falls in the categories of low intensity , chronic urban slaughter motivated by criminal activity and drug trade , and the occasional spree shooting motivated by mental illness or ideology . 
  neither ever come to constitute anything but a fractional number of the total firearm * possessing * population , and are routinely committed by people whom laws forbid and seek to restrict from possession of guns entirely . 
  crucifying gun owners is as foolish as blaming people with modems for the proliferation of child pornography . 
   it 's not like guns could make a bad situation worse . 
  except concealed carriers and firearms owners ( yes , i * do * mean people who legally own their guns : not drug charged racist kids who illegally were given a gun , or mentally deranged kids who kill their own mother and steal her guns ) do n't commit crimes any more than the general populace . 
  in fact , they commit fewer ; far fewer . 
  http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba324 not only that , but the most recent federal research shows americans lawfully use their firearms effectively and often : http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2013/06/handguns_suicides_mass_shootings_deaths_and_self_defense_findings_from_a.html like 500,000 to 3 million times a year , and that furthermore :  studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns ( i.e. , incidents in which a gun was ` used ' by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender ) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies . 
  as it turns out , decent people protecting themselves do a much better job if they have a firearm than if they do n't . 
   and if you have a person who wants to commit a drug crime , there 's no way that arming him would make him more dangerous . 
  * arming him ? 
  * laws that do n't take away the right of lawful people to access firearms do n't * arm * criminals , any more than being able to keep your internet traffic private * aids * child pornography traffickers . 
  holy fucking shit dude . 
  but no , you 're right . 
  http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm 88 thousand alcohol related deaths a year ( vastly outnumbering firearms homicides , even with police action and lawful citizen shooting added in to criminal violence , the majority ) means we ought to have background checks on every purchase of alcohol , ban strong content liquor , and have breathalyzer locks on all vehicles . 
  the massive networks of child pornography producers and distributors : http://www.npr.org/2013/11/18/245913200/hundreds-arrested-in-massive-child-pornography-ring that exist and use the internet to disseminate their filth should mean that all your internet traffic is monitored , your emails read , and your information stored for law enforcement to peruse . 
  if you 're doing nothing wrong , you 've got nothing to hide , right ? 
  defining the limits of human freedom by invoking worst case scenarios is sickening . 
  either you imagine that virulent racists and psychotic killers and child pornographers and drunk drivers are so much the * norm * that we all ought suffer for it , or you have a completely warped view of what leads people to crime . 
  legal access to firearms has nothing to do with criminal access to them . 
  * the shooter 's father already violated a law about providing firearms people charged with drug offenses like him * and you think the remedy is even more controls based in law that * people already did n't follow * ? 
  ** you 're saying we can stop speeding at 90 miles an hour , committed by a few , by changing the speed limit for anyone who follows the law going 75 to now go 50 , without actually addressing the people speeding **, 
  weird how states like vermont with super loose gun laws seem to have no trouble . 
  it 's like the real problem is drug crime , mental illness , or racial/political animus . 
  but * that * could n't be it !, 
  if that were it , we 'd even have spree shooters motivated by political ideology in places like norway , or criminal shootings in sweden , or school shootings in germany , despite a - - oh _______________________________ the facts are * not * on the side of the narrative of `` well , these people want * more * guns in society , therefore * more * crime '' , anymore than [ ** this person with a shotgun ** ] ( http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/katelynfrancis.jpg ) can be said to present the same propensity for crime in the united states as [ ** this person with a shotgun ** ] ( http://earhustle411.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/mexican-gangs.jpg ), 
   i can see a huge ~ ~ deportation ~ ~ amnesty incoming ftfy, 
  in america , we have men that know what channel no5 and ak-47s are and use them both . 
  it is a fun country . 
  ak47 is the famous kalashnikov rifle . 
  most ak pattern rifles americans buy are in the akms configuration ( the modernized version the russians used up through the 70s , before switching to a different caliber ) , and the wassenar agreement export model ( wasr ) is a popular version of this . 
  romarm in romania builds a lot of these and we buy them . 
  unless we want really nice aks and get ( now sadly banned ) russian built ak rifles from izhevsk or bulgarian ones . 
  no , the fucking is happening , and earlier , and without marriage and commitment and procreation . 
  literally going through the motions , but not following through , is the epitome of the west 's native demographic 's crisis . 
  at least for six more months , there wo n't be a split on sanctions against russia ( one way or the other ) . 
  the eu experiment is going to live and die on its ability to handle problems of a unified polity , shared borders and shared finances , just as any individual member nation must do so as a nation . 
  in the same way a nation only works when its states and provinces are subordinate in some matters to a larger union , * and * only if that larger union does right by all of those states , so too will be the fate of the eu . 
  us politics over immigration is deeply divided on a state by state basis , and it prompts massive pressure in federal elections . 
  we 're all americans , but arizona is carrying a heavy burden for all the illegal immigration northeastern liberals like to pretend is n't so bad . 
  it 's one of the most divisive issues , if not * the * most divisive issue in the us , with a cultural and geographic distinction broader economic issues do n't have . 
  the eu has to establish real federalism , or stop pretending it can create obligations no one is going to mutually fulfill . 
  england ( a former nation ) and london seem to dominate the former nations of scotland and northern ireland when it comes to the politics of the uk . 
  that 's already lead to so much distrust and anger , among people who are irrevocably tied by language and heritage and history . 
  it was n't enough to keep ireland part of them , however . 
  so what to make of how disparate the eu is in language , history , heritage and interests ? 
  scotland recently decided ( narrowly ) it would be happy to stay in the uk . 
  ireland long ago decided it would not be . 
  will greece have to make such a decision soon ? 
  avoiding these problems and letting the boundaries of state and federal power for so long was how the us got itself into a civil war , and even since then , it 's not always entirely clear what set of dictums is more relevant to the actual legal realities of a jurisdiction . 
  i 'm not saying there will have to be a civil war , or have to be an eu with inherently weaker and stronger members in a federalized system without real sovereignty for different people , but it seems to me these issues have been totally glossed over from the days of the steel and coal commission among the eu'a people themselves . 
  what exactly is a `` european '' and what is `` europe '' ? 
  that 's going to have to be nailed down by a determination of powers and obligations , instead of this fucking mess with refugees and immigrants and border closings/neglect and insane financial policy . 
  do n't elect any incumbents who wo n't deal with this stuff , or you 'll be kicking the can down the road . 
   we ca n't send them back people !, 
  there is no legal way around this . 
  not even changing the law !, 
  the only thing that stops illegal immigration is if it 's not tenable to have an existence as someone who came into the country illegally . 
  no public assistancrz high fines for anyone sheltering or employing illegal immigrants . 
  there would be no need for any border security to protect against illegal immigrants looking to exploit labor norms or welfare of it was literally impossible for them to find a job or public assistance because anyone who could do such a thing would be risking lots of money to do so . 
  you would n't even need to have a deportation regime . 
   what this means is russia would put up more troops near swedish borders and point more missiles at it , were the country to join nato . 
  this is a normal response . 
  `` if you join a defensive organization that has n't invaded , harmed , or threatened russia in any material way because you 're upset about how we annexed and invaded part of a sovereign nation looking to join the eu and eurozone one day , we 're going to point nukes at you and position invasion forces dedicated to fighting you . '', 
  so normal !, 
  they 're hardly the reason for these birthrates . 
  the west has long subsidized overpopulation by providing mass medical care , mass food assistance , and monetary assistance and goods to impoverished countries , killing their local economies and perpetuating the ability of their population to grow ( and not work ) . 
  a poem written by one person , and put on a monument , is n't legislation written by elected officials . 
  we had laws screening immigrants for mental and physical health and suitability as future americans back then , too . 
  in fact , we even specifically * limited * immigration from non-european countries ( and we did n't even allow * all * europeans over here ) because we did n't know then how to integrate so many people , or so many different kinds of people . 
  pretending that there 's any justification from the non-contextual sampling of that poem thrown out all by itself in a twee and snarky way is just ahistoric and and dumb . 
  what , did you think you could 've known us history better than an american ? 
  surprise , motherfucker , i 'm an * immigrants ' * kid on top of that , and * i * can see the wisdom of limiting immigration , too !, 
  fuck you and your new colossus quote . 
  oh , i was including that ... 
  send them back , and refuse them all access to public funded services except emergency medine ( and transport * out * ), 
  or gotten drunk , or coerced by a teacher or boss .
