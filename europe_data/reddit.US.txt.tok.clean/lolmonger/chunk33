  it 's a problem , but it 's not a hugely outsized problem . 
  i 'm frankly more worried about the situation of the eurozone at this point . 
  i think they might be betting that the imf and ecb have such an interest in a preserved euro , european union , and world debt and currency market without an international order where profligate nations can be kicked out of currency and policy unions ( even after 50 % reductions for investors ! ), 
  that they 'll bend and offer another round of bailouts , or at least some concessions on pensions + the ability to keep using the euro . 
  i really * hope * that 's not what 's being done , and that this committee really does n't speak for tspiras or varoufakis or greece 's financial leadership , because that would be insane . 
  but it 's possible , and it 's possible it would ` work ' . 
  i do n't think merkel ( maybe shauble ) or juncker would want a greek exit from the eurozone or eu at this point , not when they 've invested so heavily in trying to save its place . 
  edit : http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=714066 yeah ; pensions not cut ( because of the poverty issue ) and euro membership intact , but big cuts on government spending ( defense spending * is * outsized in greece ) and hopefully some market reforms . 
  if that can happen , everyone will be the better off for it , not least of all the coming generation of greeks . 
  get out of greece and work/live somewhere else , because my countrymen consistently made retarded policy choices in the electorate and government for 30 + years at a minimum . 
   but how can they physically be raped by women ? 
  one of my female friends was raped and she said ( not casually or anything , this was in one of those ` heavy ' conversations you never hope to have ) that she did in fact orgasm during her rape . 
  it was * not * pleasurable ; it was horrifying - she felt like her body was betraying her , and it really screwed up her ability to have a physical relationship with * anyone * for a long time . 
  same deal happens to men ; i know * i * sure had a lot of erections beyond my control growing up - - - men can be raped , even if they are n't being penetrated . 
  it 's whether the dental is voiced or not . 
  english used to have the same orthographical distinction with thorn . 
   he actually is rather well spoken ... mostly . 
  he 's a little too passionate . 
  like , i have no real problem with the content , but his tone is n't sympathetic . 
  it 's a little grating . 
  the eu and us will overtake them in massive redistribution of public money or future borrowings to accommodate social welfare programs and the half-assed integration of mass immigrant populations though as their native populations ' demographics decline , so wwoooooo !!!, 
  children born to parents your age generally have better genetic material . 
  so , so many problems correlate with maternal age . 
  younger men 's sperm has a strong correlation between motility and health as well . 
  get married , raise your kids to be better than anyone else 's , be awesome . 
  ahh , much thanks . 
  should 've known from spanish ` joven ' , but we translate that as youth too often !, 
  i love it when people bring up vietnam as a us failure/act of warmongering . 
  communism did n't get to spread in south east asia after korea and vietnam , and s korea and vietnam are our bros now along with almost all non-chinese asean nations because lol china . 
  same deal with former warsaw pact nations because lol russia . 
  everyone likes starbucks and ipads . 
  no one likes crushed protests and breadlines . 
  come study here and become one of us . 
  or have a bunch of kids , send em here for schooling and then have cousins you need to visit in america . 
  give us your language and food . 
  we will add it to the collection . 
  and the currency zone is going and fucking itself , too . 
  at least their eastern nations are sort of serious about nato , i guess . 
  eh ; do as americans do . 
  germanic words for the ` ugly ' stuff , latin lexicon for the pretty/medical things shit , feces tits , mammaries swine , pork young ` un , youth forsake , relinquish aware , cognizant fare , voyage etc. 
  just do the same ; if you 're seeing a shitty motion picture , go ahead and call it a `` movie '' especially if it 's a hollywood action film . 
  then call some sensible british * film * a film and call some particularly european arthouse business a ` cinema ', 
  then again , we still do n't know what 's true or not . 
  in a universe where whatever snowden brought with him as a bargaining chip * was * critical and * was * decrypted or partially given to the russians/chinese , it * would * be the uk or us government confirming that to a reporter than resulted in it being reported on . 
  all this points to , for me , is that western governments need to create very , very good whistleblower protections so that our intelligence services can operate effectively foreign militaries and organizations , but not be able to persecute their own employees for any missteps they 'd try to cover up when they violate the rights of their own citizens or those of allied countries . 
  in the us , we do it via angel investing/venture capital with very low taxes on what they earn as a result of their investment , so private individuals and companies throw billions of dollars at anyone who can present a workable plan to make them even more . 
  whatever the system is , it has to be one that makes risk low and reward high , or at least better than usual - - that 's how trust happens , that 's how credit markets become freer , that 's how risks get taken . 
  yeah , but one of the things that distinguishes culture and the change from simple primate status to being humans was our development and use of tools , too . 
  language matters , because it 's literally our tool of conveying thoughts and attitudes precisely among `` one another '' . 
  it determines who ` our group ' and the ` other groups ' are . 
  would n't be an issue if that came with requirements to learn the language and adopt the customs of where they 're being welcomed . 
  it would just mean consumer demand/worker pool increase , like free births 20 years down the line . 
  but the lie of universal cultural equity has been swallowed whole by institutions of academia and public policy making , so they wo n't be , and instead there will be linguistic , racial and ethnic tensions that divide lawmaking endeavors . 
  same thing is happening to the us , just from mexican/latin american illegal immigrants . 
  a more powerful federal government , and then eventually a federal bank , which we still fight over , and tolerate only because despite significant ` domestic policy ' differences between states , we 're all americans . 
  i do n't know how similar `` europeans '' are internally . 
  there are californians and texans and pennsylvanians and michiganders , sure - - but greeks and germans and irish and italians are a little more different in their ultimate trust and sense of unity . 
  smaller backlash than sinking those ships with migrants onboard . 
  \\ #justkidding #wouldworktho, 
  http://aviationweek.com/awin/darpa-refocuses-hypersonics-research-tactical-missions they 've run into issues . 
  rather , boeing and lockheed are pissing and moaning about each other 's issues to get more darpa money . 
  well they 're not gon na get great public assistance or find bountiful private employment in greece , that 's for sure . 
  considering the us stands as the constant guarantor of eu nations ' ultimate security against russia , and we have our own large ( and pacific focused ) tensions with china , i ca n't imagine any scenario where it does n't behoove europe as the eu ( or perhaps an ad hoc european security organization ) to get its shit in gear with military technology and defense spending . 
  there will likely never be a russian attack on nato or a us-china war ; that risks nuclear consequences - - - but they simply are n't impossibilities . 
  they 'd just be horrible outcomes . 
  [ horrible outcomes happen ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/rows_of_bodies_of_dead_inmates_fill_the_yard_of_lager_nordhausen,_a_gestapo_concentration_camp.jpg ) . 
  even when you pledge they 'll [ ` never again ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omarska_camp ) happen . 
  and if there * were * a us-china war , and massively ramped up chinese defense spending and development in 15-25 years time * were * to mean that the us had a problem in the pacific it could n't easily , or inexpensively resolve - - - - i doubt it 'd be a good idea for europe at that point to still be counting on the us to have so many forces deployed across her nations , and still be reliant on it to protect her from russia . 
  peace might be fashionable , but it 's not protected by anything but the credible will and capacity to kill people who would otherwise break it . 
   [ ** the us is an ally only on paper nowadays , in fact , it regularily commits acts of war against us ** ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131119161816/adventuretimewithfinnandjake/images/1/1b/lolwut.jpg ),

  '' ] ( http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/fleet-of-ships.jpg ), 
  i do n't think it was ineptitude ; it 's not like morons operate sam systems . 
  i think it was that they simply assumed no civil aircraft would be flying over their warzone , and this was a chance to take down a ukrainian transport - - as was boasted in the immediate aftermath - - and they just did n't know it was a civilian plane . 
  that shootdown you linked to seems like a missile error/operator incompetence . 
  russian-trained/aided/integrated ukrainian rebels ( perhaps even russian servicemen , i do n't know ) * intended * to shootdown the aircraft they shot down ; they just had mistaken it 's actual identity . 
  then again , it 's hard to reduce every kind of incident like this down to the reasons for it happening or intent or whatever - - there 's too much that gets anticipated in the aftermath and excused . 
  russia has killed innocents in this way , ukraine has , and the us has as well . 
  your english is * so , so * much better than my german , i assure you . 
  i guess it kind of comes down to what being `` european '' is going to mean for the european union , if that 's going to be the political body of a unified europe . 
  is it just a financial club ? 
  equality in that club is clearly broken , despite a shared currency . 
  is it a trade club ? 
  by export and import , the us , china , and russia are more important to germany than many eu nations . 
  russia and china figure higher than eu nations for * poland * as well . 
  is it a political union , like , in terms of domestic policy ? 
  that might work insofar as the ` easy ' stuff , but on issues like gay marriage , there are strong east west divides . 
  on immigration and refugees , the dysfunction is even worse than in the us between our liberal states in the northeast and west ( long a haven for illegal immigrants ) and southern states whose electorates are being changed by demographic shift brought on by massive immigration , not all of it legal . 
  i do n't think russia would dare attack a nato member outright . 
  even if turkey is n't part of the eu , there 's no way war will come to them from russia ; article 5 would be invoked . 
  as for nations which * are n't * nato , or eu ; one need only look at georgia , moldova , and ukraine . 
  as for eu nations which are n't nato partners ... that 's the ambiguity ; will eu nations rush to defend them ? 
  and will they be doing so as nato partners ? 
  will their potentially coming under attack by russian aggression as a consequence involve nato ? 
  and will eu expansion simply now halt because of russian aggression ? 
  obviously ukraine and georgia and moldova ca n't really join nato now ... but their eu membership , financially , has been killed too - - and ukraine was * going * to join the eu ; what does it mean if the eu wo n't do shit about them being invaded ? 
  i do n't know whether eu/eurozone/nato membership is some kind of talisman against russian aggression , but it should concern `` europeans '' * whatever that identity is supposed to mean * that pretty obviously it 's membership in nato , carried almost entirely by the us , that ultimately protects any kind of civil system and currency union they want to have . 
  that 's simply not sustainable , unless the eu/eurozone wants to invite : 1 ) more and more us involvement in their trade situation : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/39pu5m/the_united_states_house_of_representatives_on/ 2 ) invite vulnerability in the future if there was ever , and hopefully it wo n't happen , a us-china war on our pacific front ... ... we simply * would n't * be available to really help europe in a significant capacity during it , or for a time after if whatever `` europe '' is ( culturally , politically , or by currency union ) were under threat from russia . 
   but really the reason snowden defected was because of the mass and indiscriminate spying done on the civilian population of the us and the eu 1 ) he could 've done that without defecting 2 ) he wanted to avoid prosecution of any kind , and simply assumed any kind of western nation would extradite him 3 ) and so he brought us intel with him as a bargaining chip to give himself worth to russia or china beyond just his leaks  not because he wanted to blow some spies ' cover in russia or china . 
  yeah , but he 's done that now .
