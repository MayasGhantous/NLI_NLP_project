  that it is n't how 19th century racists wanted it to be does n't mean it 's not a biological reality . 
  i see what you mean - - i doubt putin has a romanov descendant up his sleeve , though . 
  all i 'm saying is that there 's no reason the church has to be involved in politics at all . 
  yeah , i really do n't want the us to abandon nuclear . 
  water , solar , wind power , and then nuclear making up the difference . 
  hydrocarbons are for air/spacecraft , missiles , lubricant and emergency fuel . 
  and industrial chemistry i guess . 
  no , i think putin is just another in a long line of russian strongmen . 
  he 's just using the tools available . 
  under stalin they pretty much did execute massive numbers of the church leadership and organization , and i believe those who were n't high enough to merit being executed were in fact sent to labor camps . 
  religion was very much not part of the propaganda apparatus under soviet rule . 
  it 's easy in 2015 to see them as part and parcel of backwards awfulness because the world is becoming more secular , but there 's no real reason russian orthodoxy should be behind putin like this . 
  also , random question : if i speak only shitty russian and english , how hard would it be for me to navigate kiev for tourism/nightlife ? 
  do most younger people know english ? 
  i 'm really excited by a lot of germany 's policy decisions ; so much american hesitancy to explore alternate fuel sources is because we rely on a massive infrastructure investment in older , abundant , though very unclean , energy practices in order to power our economic activity - - - not because we especially begrudge the technologies of green energy or anything ( though we 're becoming more like the frogs on nuclear power ... ) germany is a close-enough analogue for the us in several sectors , and they 're moving right along on alternatives . 
  if the teutons can demonstrate that the metal-works stay active without coal , the anglo-saxons will follow . 
  at least they are n't shooting them or sending them to labor camps for potentially being dissidents as in the ussr . 
  still , sad though to see the church co-opted ( and apparently so willing to cooperate ) as an organ of state power . 
   it 's like japan and south korea in that regard . 
  who also each pretty much really only need to worry about china . 
  most of the west is already like this - - all they need to worry about is how quickly the russians could overwhelm them , vs how quickly the us could fight back . 
  this is basically the design of us congress . 
  the entire thing is structurally set up to frustrate federal lawmaking if state lawmaking would be better -- but a lot of us seem to have forgotten that . 
  we ca n't even stand * each other 's * priorities ( c.f. 
  californians and texans ) - - how people think the eu would do better if brussels could enact sweeping laws and quickly do so is beyond me . 
  y' all do n't even have the same language , let alone culture . 
  almost as much as they like being non-aligned and * slightly * more than they hate china . 
  looking at their military hardware from a combined arms perspective is hilarious : israeli assault rifles , soviet heavy air , american attack helis , british and swedish field guns and howitzers , french anti-tank missiles and jets , russian icbms , etc. 
  they buy from everyone , and attempt go to war with no one - - but they 're pretty much ready to go to war with whoever so long as it would n't be a sustained fight with a unsc member without disagreement from the other ones . 
  it 's the strategy that was birthed by tn kaul - - they could see the writing on the wall once they realized they could negotiate for us servicemen being freed from nkorea by way of red china one year , and have nixon sail a nuclear armed vessel by them the next , have kissinger give the pakistanis tanks one year , and have a us president come to talk nuclear technology transfer while the russians imploded the next . 
  india 's in it for india and they do n't pretend otherwise ; you have to respect them for that . 
  it 's speaking softly and carrying a big stick in many , many ways . 
  still wo n't really work . 
  female fertility follows older biological dictums than social norms created in the last 30 years - - and after around 30 , fertility plummets/healthy children are n't easy to turn out . 
  replacement rate might be met , but growing out of the hole most western nations are in is going to require above that . 
  and to properly parent a kid , and spread out expenses ? 
  you 've got to space pregnancies . 
  but how many years does having a first kid at 25 leave ? 
  and how does a woman manage to have a career with 25-30 involving one or two gaps for maternity ? 
  the west is going to have to turn to immigration , and your politicians will do it because it 'll likely also mean a dependent class and new set of voters for them to rely on . 
  and you guys have an awesome beer culture , are apparently totally relaxed about religion , have absurdly attractive women , gave us krtek , and are basically a slavic germanic hybrid . 
  it 's one of the places i 'd like to live at some point . 
  you guys have way better ( well , better in my perspective ) gun laws than new york , california , new jersey , hawaii , maryland , etc. 
  czech nationals can very easily own semi-auto versions of the vz . 
  58 and cz 805 bren and of course , the entire line of cz pistols ( and many other imports ) . 
  it 's also not entirely impossible to obtain , for the purposes of building a collection , fully automatic weapons . 
  no magazine restrictions , no stock/folding stock restrictions , no restrictions on barrel length , nationwide * shall-issue * concealed carry licences , etc. 
  seriously - - - new york state/nyc are far , far more restricted . 
  the czech republic comes pretty freaking close . 
  all obligations to whom ? 
  the rest of the eurozone , or the promises it made to greek people ? 
  italian stuff is early 1900s american . 
  german/anglo stuff is like 17/1800s american . 
  no one wants to say puberty is happening earlier because : 1 ) if you say that has any negatives you hate menarche and women 's sexuality blah blah blah . 
  2 ) despite loads of evidence higher body fat contributes to this and other pathologies ( * pathologies * just like metabolic syndrome ) no one has figured out a pc way to tell people to stop making their kids fat . 
  i 'm not really saying it is , but the following will be true - - we 'll stop being an ethnically and linguistically unified nation ; we 'll have the situation of the balkans with a second-society of hispanos . 
  we 'll also become a nation with a much much expanded federal bureaucracy and social spending , and the flow of money will be from anglo taxes to hispano beneficiaries for the first few decades because of economic realities of who is employed and in what jobs now . 
  also , a lot of our cultural distinctiveness will change as we go from being kind of an anglo-nation in which other cultures exist as smaller accoutrements , to being a mostly latino nation like spain or argentina that have other entrants of european norms . 
  none of it is necessarily bad , but it will irrevocably change what america is . 
  1 ) any politician proposing this will be labeled a racist xenophobe 2 ) immigrants are cheaper in order to supplement the population , and you can basically , as a pro-immigration politician , count on them voting for you , and their children voting for your party , etc. 
  the us is going to be a latino nation in the next three generations because of it . 
  you know not a fucking thing about what i believe . 
  no , i 'm saying that long term european peace should n't derive from the promise of us troops deploying against whatever spectre ( like russia , previously serbia ) happens to threaten it . 
  ** btw ** - wall of text warning . 
  it 's only because you asked for me to justify myself . 
  article 5 , in theory , in completely untested theory , specifies that european powers who are nato members would have to band together to protect a fellow member . 
  as nato ( not as part of a unified eu ) - - but even that might not be enough . 
  putin is playing a very , very dangerous game of chicken with europe and the west . 
  wanting to join the eu is n't enough for anyone to lift a finger . 
  signing accords with the us and russia on the often trumpeted nuclear non-proliferation objective is n't enough for america to contribute plate-carrier clad riflemen . 
  germany and france , as the two biggest defense/economic partners on the continent are doing what exactly in response to russia 's aggression ? 
  i believe there still is n't a final decision on the mistral carriers , and germany 's military is n't exactly legendary anymore - - and a quarter of their energy imports are from russia . 
  ** putin is pushing at the edges of the paperworks of civilization and post-war peace ** , because he is asserting a new russian dominance . 
  he is calling into question what it really means for there to be an eu ( and its precious ` battlegroups ' , so cute ) , what it really means for there to be a unsc , what it really means for there to be a nato , because in his calculation , the west much softer than its higher spending and more modern hardware might otherwise imply . 
  that 's why he took crimea with impunity , took eastern ukraine with impunity , and is n't budging on either territory despite sanctions . 
  like falling oil prices and the saudis : sure , it 'll hurt them , but it 'll hurt american nat gas companies much more . 
  the sanctions will hurt russia , but the long term lack of faith and trust among european partners and the hodgepodge of military and political alliances and unions is much , much higher price that the russians are extracting . 
  eventually , even if things do n't get better economically for them , their people will adjust , just the same as the saudis could pretty much weather 40 dollar wti if they really wanted to ( and probably wo n't have to ) - - - for the saudis , it 's important to keep marketshare from the canucks and americans , even if keystone xl is threatened to happen in the future , or nat gas production steps up . 
  for the russians , its important they can show eastern european nations how very capricious their western ` allies ' are , and how very inconsequential soft diplomatic tools like sanctions are in limiting the might of a vdv detachment or an armored infantry column . 
  ** hence ** this `` dragoon '' march america is trying to ease the fears of the baltics and eastern european members of nato , but fundamentally , i do n't believe we should have to do this , because i think longterm european security will have to be from a nato that is n't just america , or not from nato , because europe can handle its shit . 
  or else , a non-unified europe , but i 'm worried about * that * , too . 
  black troops in europe during the big second had the same thoughts , sadly ... 
   , they are thanking them for making us safer from russia . 
  that remains to be seen . 
  i am uneasy about the prospect of european peace contingent on american troops . 
  there are n't americans starving , but even without a massive ( 15-20 million ) import from latin american nations of poor people who live in a sub-society removed from language/educational opportunities , there are plenty of its native people living in poverty and going hungry , rural and urban . 
  centcom/nsa literally monitor them daily - - once a certain number of nato country flags show up with anti-american sentiment , we 're going to invade . 
  also what hell-scape do i inhabit ? 
  descriptions of america sometimes amuse me , but sometimes it 's just frankly perplexing . 
  no , but if bill clinton thought that he could conduct us foreign policy under the assumption that ronald reagan 's decisions as the elected head of state did n't somehow characterize america in its relations with the world , he 'd have been an idiot . 
  it 's not like the slate gets wiped clean each presidency or something . 
  ** i have awoken from my slumber ** 1 . 
  f-35 does n't suck as a plane to be used from 2020 --  2050 with several block upgrades like the f-16 , i can tell you why if you want to get into it . 
  as for pricing ? 
  blows on that front . 
  ak series is not better , nor is more usable * though there are plenty of platforms , many of which are operated by european militaries * , better than a direct impingement/straight line buffered rifle firing 5.56 and not the .308 for which it was intended . 
  they only nice thing you can say about the ak is the simple piston system , and short stroke piston is still better , and that 's found in the fn scar ( again ; thanks , yurope ! ), 
  and just like the fn minimi becoming the us military ` saw ' , the fn scar is deployed with by special units . 
  anyways , in case anyone gives a fuck , let me know , i will tell you all about roller delayed blowback , the fantastical weapons innovations in small arms by german engineers in late-war europe ( 1940s ) the there and back again development of the cetme into the g3 , and why heckler and koch is digging its own grave and the g36 is balls , but the cz 805 bren is * not * . 
  american criminals sent to belgian prisons might not work out so well .
