  everyone thought this kind of thing stopped with hitler 's practice of anschluss . 
  lol , afd . 
  you have to wait until you become massive before you can have people saying retarded shit . 
   i do wonder whether joe sixpack in 2016 knows what a `` nato ally '' is or even what obligations nato has of its members , whether `` article 5 '' would mean anything . 
  a significant number of `` joe sixpacks '' make up the demographic of americans who actually go serve in the military , occasionally on nato missions , as opposed to the type that demure their provincialism with nicknames . 
  because the last two times europeans went about appeasing dictatorial regimes and selling out one another for the sake of short term interests , we got dragged into massive conflicts that we had to win for them at significant monetary and human costs to ourselves , and it was * worse * the second time around when one might 've thought they 'd have learned their lesson ... an ounce of prevention over a pound of cure . 
   we spend billions of euro 's on them to improve their infrastructure , government , environment etc. , we 've opened our borders to them , we are sharing our currency with them , yet we 're the literal incarnation of evil to them . 
  the us spent a lot of money and took on a lot of risk to rebuild western europe after ww2 - - - and yet lots of western european nations seem reluctant to have anything close to the minimum contribution to nato , and sneer at us requests to do so . 
  sure we can . 
  slovenia ish where ( sniff ) zizek ish from , and slovakia is ` the other one ' . 
  also works for czech republic and slovakia . 
  along with the questions about germany and serbia for ww1 , i think a lot of these results are school kids googling stuff . 
  phrasing a google search as a question instead of anticipating the keywords likely to be in the results you 're seeking is something little kids/old people do , and the repeated ` is important ? ', 
  form in the other questions is a lot like someone just learning stuff for the first time . 
  because the point of a nation-state is for people who constitute a nation , to have a state - a polity with powers of legislation and enforcement which serves their security and economic interests through policy . 
  every foreign national whose security and economic interests are provided for by the nation-state is a net drain - - - though a tiny one , on the total resources that can go to a native national . 
  yes , foreign nationals who are chinese ( or american ... ) might be paying all the right taxes , and be investing/spending in the economy , but their ownership is now chinese , or american . 
  there is now a chinese or american whose income exists from the store - not an italian . 
  a chinese or american now feeds their kids with income from the store - not an italian . 
  a chinese or american is now benefited by security from the police - not an italian in that position . 
  granted : italy is a massively developed western nation , and venice is a large city . 
  it 's not like one or two chinese ( or american ) shopkeepers are a nuisance . 
  but imagine something like 30 % of all opportunities to earn an income as a venetian , as an italian via running a shop , were * taken up by chinese or americans * . 
  imagine being confronted with a reminder that in your own country , in your own city , you were being shut out of scarce finite opportunity to make a living for yourself within the legal framework of the nation-state by foreign nationals . 
  that 's what people resent , * particularly * if there is any less than legal presence of foreign nationals involved , or less than legal labor practices involved , and any tplerance of this by authorities who derive benefits from having ignored their principle duty as agents of the nation-state : protecting the security and economic well being of their own nationals . 
   the difference between you and me is that i do not generalize and draw conclusions about millions of individuals because of a few thousands . 
  i 'll say it again , judging millions by the actions of few is idiotic and unfair but we know how millions of individuals feel when they 're raised in mena cultures or those influenced by wahhabist islam . 
  ** we know ** that the migrants who rape women and assault gays in refugee camps are * no good * . 
  we have no real way of screening who can fit in , and who can not , and we 're faced with the prospect of millions who want to come . 
  surely german political theory has something like ` precautionary principle ' within it ? 
   the whole point of our liberal values is that , while we have shared values , everyone is free to act within them as they wish to do . 
  but do n't you see how the culture of mena peoples + wahhabist islam * directly contradicts * that ? 
   currently in germany , even those whose families have lived here for decades really do not have an `` ideal identity '' . 
  the whole point of our liberal values is that , while we have shared values , everyone is free to act within them as they wish to do . 
  and chinatowns in the us still have monolingual chinese speakers , over a hundred years after they first came to the west coast , and decades since 1965 on the east , some of them being born here . 
  but chinese people in the us who are more chinese than american [ ** do n't do stuff like this ** ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sxesjfc--eg/maxresdefault.jpg ) they [ ** do n't do this ** ] ( https://d1s6yijfrvmtp9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/07133222/down-with-democracy-we-want-just-islam.jpg ) and [ even though plenty of immigrants/descendant populations to the us drink and go clubbing ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/club-isis-watch-terrorist-salah-abdeslam-drinking-dancing-brussels-disco-prior-paris-attacks-1552084 ) , the vast majority [ ** do n't do this ** ] ( https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/ad_201274908.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all ) or [ ** this ** ] ( http://s2.dmcdn.net/p6vrk.jpg ) even though plenty of us immigrant kids [ smoke weed in college ] ( https://www.yahoo.com/news/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-college-weed-dealer-151737944.html?ref=gs ) , they do n't do [ ** this ** ] ( http://resourcemagonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/usa_boston_bombing_mcx09_35250655.jpg ) * except * for a * certain group * of people who have come to the west , whose * particular religion and political ideologies * come from a * certain swathe * of places abroad . 
  fundamentally , promoting ** native ideals ** , whether it is anglo-american culture ( and i repeat ; i 'm a brown skinned south asian , hardly a lily white englishman , and my native language comes from chaucer ) or german culture is not only fortifying for the nation , it can * also * accommodate differences - - all differences * except those which seek to remove that native ideal * . 
  that 's the point , as far as i 'm concerned . 
  the gastarbeiters were initially supposed to be * temporary * labor . 
  * guest * workers . 
  not transplant workers . 
  the whole idea was sold that way , then politicians did something else . 
  have they just moved on from bait and switch to just doing as they please ? 
  furthermore , look at the case of the bosnians when it comes to muslim refugees . 
  european people who by and large learned german , worked hard , and did n't cause trouble . 
  and they were sent out . 
  so now , when its * quite * obvious between minijobs and rising rents , that germany * does n't need * a deluge of unskilled labor , and has had as policy the ejection of even * decently * assimilated refugees - - - and people leaving the breakup of yugoslavia * were * unambiguously refugees , something that can not be said for all of the migrants passing through safe countries and of dubious origins - - - - what on earth are merkel and company playing at ? 
  what is the objective ? 
  current refugee policy seems totally contrary to both the learned experience of both the gastarbeiters and bosniaks in * very * recent political history . 
  what would be the reason , in your estimation ? 
   as a gay man , my interactions with an egyptian exchange student led to him going from overt hostility to respectful aloofness and curiosity , to grudging tolerance to acceptance and explicit rejection of islamic homophobia . 
  you know what would 've happened if you were an openly gay man in egypt ? 
  or pakistan ? 
  or bangladesh ? 
  or saudi arabia ? 
  or yemen ? 
  or indonesia ? 
  the fact of the matter is , unless an individual devout muslim from a foreign culture is brought up/deluged within western culture , and * not * surrounded by an islamic society , the journey which you witnessed which is , as you correctly point out ** an explicit rejection of fundamental islamic principles ** , will not occur . 
  that is why it is potentially dangerous for mass muslim immigration to occur without controls for language skills , economic employment , and in a real sense , cultural fit - - - because as has been the experience of several western nations , it can occur that muslim immigrant populations will self segregate into communities which are * overwhelmingly * islamic and * not western * in their social expectations , raising individuals with our language , accent , and passport but ** their ** values - - ones which deem you as a homosexual man , to be an insult to allah , one who is irredeemably worthless . 
  # [ read this from the associated press ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/9eece103e37c43fba6593e9fc97f1413/across-europe-gay-migrants-face-abuse-asylum-shelters ) the people coming here * are not people who are going to fit into western society . 
  *  now , sure , i 'd be the first to acknowledge that mainstream islam , especially the creeping wahhabism around the world , demands a particularly zealous piety and strict conformance , and that someone raised in a conservative islamic environment often have blinders on that make them unreceptive to anything that challenges what they already believe . 
  * what do you think will happen if hundreds of thousands , potentially millions , of muslims who can not economically , socially , and culturally integrate quickly , come to europe , to america , to canada ? 
  *  similarly , just as the children of devout catholic , protestant , buddhist , hindu and other immigrants , i 've watched a number of children of muslim immigrants , despite being raised in the faith , simply drift away from it when they reached adulthood in a free secular society . 
  just like the children of catholic , protestant , buddhist , hindu and many other immigrants do . 
  * but do you know what happens when someone in europe is still a devout hindu ? 
  * * what do you think is the danger posed to a gay man like yourself , by people who in 2016 are devout protestants in canada ? 
  * do you really just not see the difference , and the scale of the issue ? 
  just prioritize the wellbeing of multinational corporations over your own people , and cede political control from the citizenry to un-elected functionaries , and you too can be an enlightened cosmopolitan !, 
  ^ 10/10 troll everyone pay attention , this is how you do it right, 
  but this way , europeans whose culinary cultures meant they passed rigorous food laws and have prices consumers are comfortable with , can have * slightly * lower prices and see their domestic agricultural industry railroaded by lower quality american produce !, 
  and americans can keep buying european automobiles without those manufacturers having their markets cut off by fiat by regulatory authorities !, 
  how are you * not * seeing the positives ? 
  i think the ttp is an awful deal for the american worker , and i think it 's likely to be a bad deal for european consumers . 
  i think it 's pretty much true that these international agreements are where multinational corporations find themselves unopposed because legal frameworks between nation-states * generally * escape democratic control by the individual sets of citizenry of any particularly nation , much to those corporations ' benefit . 
  http://www.dw.com/en/german-activists-turn-out-in-force-to-protest-ttip-trade-deal/a-18391723  critics of the free trade agreement , which is supported by the german government , say it could lead to a lowering of health and safety standards , particularly with regard to the eu 's strict regulations on food additives , genetically modified crops and the use of pesticides . 
  and it 's not just trump who thinks it 's a ` haaarible ' deal , or a ` towtal disaaaaster ' . 
  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file maybe your sympathies simply lie closer to the executives of globalism corporations and government officials , than to the people of your own nation . 
  if obama 's statements about the ttp and britain staying in the eu did n't make it abundantly clear that his administration wants the ttp to happen so that there 's unimpeded trade between the us and eu , i suppose this does . 
  ugly , ugly stuff . 
  why should their auto industry be punished if people do n't think our agricultural output is preferable ? 
  hopefully national sentiment in the us and in germany/other eu nations among the people can take a hold of their respective leaders - - - because on their own they seem only too happy to sell out entire economies for the sake of global corporate interest . 
  [ beatrix von storch 's comments in ** reuters ** ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-afd-islam-iduskcn0xe0t0 ) for those of us who are monolingual anglos :  `` islam is in itself a political ideology that is not compatible with the constitution , '' afd deputy leader beatrix von storch told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . 
   `` we are in favor of a ban on minarets , on muezzins and a ban on full veils , '' added storch , who is a member of the european parliament . 
  and another afd local official :  `` islam is not a religion like catholic or protestant christianity , but rather intellectually always associated with the takeover of the state , '' said alexander gauland , who leads the afd in brandenburg . 
   `` that is why the islamization of germany is a danger , '' he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . 
  * to the afd , germany is indeed a `` country of immigration '' , but there is to be `` moderate '' immigration by qualified professionals only . 
  in order to stop immigrants , the afd will bring back security to the border - `` where appropriate '' with protective or `` similar barriers '' . 
  * the sentiment `` islam is not part of germany '' is taken up by a large majority in the program . 
  in addition , all mosques financed from abroad are to be prohibited , as are minarets and the muezzin call . 
  in schools women and girls shall not be allowed to wear headscarves , abd the full veiling of muslim women should be banned . 
  but on mass deportations , the party does without . 
  `` we do not mean to expel all muslims , '' says beatrix von storch . 
  * ______________________ so , by my shitty highschool german + google translate powers combined : i think the afd has basically written off the idea that there can be ( in practice or in principle ) some kind of integration of * large scale * muslim populations with foreign cultural origins , within germany , and that the public symbols of islam - - like minarets and public calls to prayer , and those which diverge with german/european notions about sexuality and public institutions , like the dress of women in public schooling , should all be outright forbidden . 
  and i think they 're doing this , because they feel intrinsically , that islam is necessarily foreign to germany in terms of surface level public-culture , but also deep-culture , and that it is germany 's own identity and culture which should get priority and protection in the law , just as its territorial integrity should be protected from migrant influx . 
  this seems a more nuanced , though * actually even stricter * version of `` islam does n't belong to germany '' . 
   of course , you 're thinking ethnic diversity because that 's where you get different languages and different feelings of who one 's people are . 
  this is why assimilation is so important . 
  though i 'm brown skinned , and my parents hail from a different content , ethnically , in dress , language , food and music preferences , i was assimilated into the anglo-american milieu . 
  as are the `` italians '' and `` germans '' and `` irish '' and `` dutch '' . 
  there are no narrow , parochial feelings of kith and kin and other and foreigner in between any of these groups , because we were all melded into ` americans ' .
