  that 's exactly what keeps a society cohesive . 
   we need the priest , the banker , the statesman and the soldier . 
  and they need to be roman priests , roman coinmasters , roman senators , and roman legionaries , or else you will see justinian heralds of christianity in conflict with old roman sages , debts payable to rome or owned by byzantium , senators whose allegiance is to a republic , or to foreign consuls , troops whose oath is spqr or germanic auxii whose allegiance is to alesia . 
  seriously , you either have unity , or you do n't . 
   norwegian ( the company ) do use various tricks many consider unfair to keep costs down , the norwegian ( nationality ) pilots union is pretty up in arms about them as well , basically using foreign shell companies to hire `` local '' pilots abroad at a fraction of the salary of pilots in the regions they actually operate in and such ( i 'm not 100 % up to date on the details though ) . 
  this seems like it 's somewhere between [ chinatown buses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinatown_bus_lines#shutdowns ) and [ legislation against uber ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legal_status_of_uber%27s_service#regulatory_opposition ) i do n't know the details , but it 's definitely possible norwegian air is basically exploiting legal fictions in order to hire pilots according to one country 's labor laws , and employ them in different national markets ... . and also possible that norwegian air simply delivers good service , is still shitty ( but not illegally so ) to its workers , and is narrowly focusing its business model that traditional regional airlines ca n't compete with unless they use the law to fight them . 
  or somewhere in between , or a little bit of column a and column b. i ca n't really find any substantial coverage , though . 
   because it 's a control mechanism because it 's productive and makes a society prosperous . 
  civilizations that did n't produce lots of wealth for all of their members and did n't make themselves strong and safe were conquered by those that did . 
   diversity is strength . 
  how so ? 
  what advantages would the ming dynasty have enjoyed if only it were more diverse ? 
  the roman empire at its greatest extent was * incredibly * diverse - - but they fell because of civil wars and uncontrollable ethnic tensions ; how was their strength in diversity apparent ? 
  and i 'm talking about general human tendencies , not any particular era , because as it happens , * humans * have some things they conserve across time and geography . 
  this , is of course , why i mentioned a large array of different human societies , and then compared them - - are you still following ? 
  - - - to contemporary europe . 
   women have always worked . 
  but now we 've got them working * primarily * for the employer and the shareholders , instead of the husband and the children , so gdp can be higher , the taxbase can be larger , and the elite get to have more work done to benefit them !, 
   it is not somehow objectively better family model than others . 
  but it is . 
  look up the differential in test scores and life outcomes between people raised in an intact family , as opposed to a broken one . 
  http://www.pitt.edu/ppcl/publications/chapters/children_of_divorce.htm some family arrangements ** are better ** in how children are provided for , than others . 
  that 's just true - - and that 's the point of family arrangements ; raising the next generation . 
   it 's an old construct that makes it 's way in every generation , in every country , the free and proud yeoman , the nuclear family , etc. 
  the man has either a farm or a stable career , the woman stays at home and takes care of everything , the kids are taught solid moral values . 
   but it 's not real . 
  it just keeps showing up in civilizations that are strong and successful over and over again . 
  go back to ancient india and tell them the nuclear family with a working patriarch , a stay at home mom raising the kids is n't `` real '' . 
  go to 14th century france and tell them , men working outside the home , women raising the children is n't `` real '' . 
  go to feudal japan , and tell them , men working outside the home , women raising the children is n't `` real '' . 
  this is the ideal of like , nearly * every * society . 
  tearing it down and criticizing it is stupid - - - - though recognizing not everyone can make it work is a kind thing to do . 
   your flair suggests that you are from the united states , a country almost entirely made up off descendents of immigrants * who assimilated * over and over again , they ** assimilated ** it 's true , spaghetti is no longer thought of as an ` ethnic food ' in the anglo speaking world via italians coming to the us in large numbers . 
  * but almost none of them primarily speak italian * they assimilated . 
  that 's * no longer happening * in multicultural societies . 
  there was no `` multiculturalism '' celebrated by the state in 1920s america or 1950s america , or 1880s america when immigrants were coming before . 
  we turned all of our immigrants into americans , and even after 1965 , when it came to immigrants like my parents ( from asia ) , we ** still ** picked and chose who came , because we wanted people who would integrate economically and assimilate culturally . 
  * that 's not happening now * with illegal immigrants in the us , and en masse refugee/migrants in europe . 
   i do not believe that we need such an ideal lifestyle . 
  obviously we do need certain values and guidelines . 
  one and the same mein kumpel - - you either have an ideal which is the result of an ideal shared community identity , or you * do n't have a community * put a swede , a khoisan , a korean , a punjabi , a persian , an italian , a russian , a bangladeshi , and a georgian in a room together . 
  they can be friends , they can be coworkers , they can be made legally , citizens of all the same social group , company , and government . 
  but unless they can speak the same language , be comfortable with intermarriage , living next to one another , etc. 
  on the grounds of a * shared identity * , they wo n't really be ** nation ** . 
  the us * actually does * manage this ; because everyone speaks english and assimilates into the american accented and secularized flavor of the uk 's anglo-christian culture . 
  [ these soldiers and marines ] ( http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a121f1795a0337909a2739e35faf9aa529d42447/c=35-0-3147-2327&amp;r=x408&amp;c=540x405/local/-/media/usatoday/usatoday/2014/09/04/1409842389000-diverse-soldiers-2006.jpg ) are being sworn in as citizens . 
  we 'll take anyone . 
  but they * have to become * us . 
  ** that can not happen unless ` us ' is a certain way , ideally . 
  you can . 
  germany has pretty decent gun laws and selection compared to some us states . 
  what if they way they want to live is with their wife mandated to wear a burqa ? 
  what if they way they want to live is with their children not playing with non-muslim ? 
  what if they way they want to live is only speaking arabic or turkish ? 
  what if they way they want to live * requires change in how you want to live * ? 
  there is such a thing as community . 
  and part of that is that everyone lives similarly . 
  i am an atheist , i have brown skin , i 'm an american , and i do n't speak german . 
  is it * really * correct to say that any number of people * like me * could move to germany even becoming a majority in certain areas , and the life style we follow * would n't * alter the community ? 
  go back to 1978 in west germany , in some small village and move 100k of myself in . 
  who and how people live is the question of identity of a community . 
  it is why we can talk about nigeria and chad and korea and bhutan . 
  they are different people who live differently . 
  now , none of this precludes that people who originate elsewhere can not * assimilate * . 
  for instance , my native language and my children 's native language will be english . 
  my citizenship and theirs will be american . 
  this was not true for our ancestors , whose lifestyle we do n't share , either . 
  but we assimilated . 
  the point afd is making ( independent of what this magazine supposes ) is that community 's ** can and should ** have ideal , native , traditional identities of lifestyle . 
  nothing about this picture dictates that on grounds of race or origin , afd couldcwish to exclude those who can not 100 % mutate into these people , though that 's clearly the implication ( there are plenty of brown haired germans anyway ) . 
  furthermore , this magazine seems to be implying that this ideal , independent of that claim , is a * bad * ideal . 
  i think that 's somewhat monstrous . 
  if i move to japan , i should learn japanese . 
  i should conduct my self like a japanese person . 
  i should n't disrupt their culture . 
  my children , if i seek to live their long term , should speak , dress , act , and think like japanese - because they would * be * japanese if only they assimilate ( something very new for japan ) . 
  it would seem wrong to presume japan should accommodate * me * . 
   if anything giving guns to people leads to bloody civil wars . 
  like how the us literally came into existence ? 
  that 's the point . 
  we then actually * had * a true civil war , and since then , have we had another ? 
  hmmmm . 
   the whole idea that people would stop the government from installing a dictatorship by using their guns is a complete joke . 
  again , the usa literally exists because regular people eventually overwhelmed the empire 's forces . 
   clearly you know nothing about european history ... wow , not a hint of irony, 
   the whole idea of giving guns to people is utterly stupid in the first place that 's why we buy them . 
   i ca n't take the us constitution serious , it 's a joke . 
  we 're the wealthiest and most powerful nation-arrangement to ever exist in the history of the human species . 
  i think some of our ideas about economy and polity are decent . 
   yeah , i 'm swiss , so the us is a joke to me . 
  okay , nazi collaborator . 
  must be fun being a banker state to genocidal nations . 
  your wealth exists because you people were okay with putting jews in ovens . 
  bitch about it , but that 's the end all be all of switzerland 's economic purpose . 
  blood money . 
   i 'm refuting your ridiculous claim that legal gun owners do n't contribute to gun crime stats . 
  you know if someone says `` i never overeat '' , but you can point to them having taken seconds at thanksgiving , despite being overall very fit , i do n't think anyone will take you seriously . 
  lawful gun owners in the us own 300 + million weapons and number about 100 million . 
  there are * at the greatest possible extent * , 15 thousand firearms homicides in the us each year . 
  even assuming a complete bijection where each homicide victim is killed by one bullet from one gun held by one person , uniquely , there are 15 thousand murderers with 15 thousand murder weapons among ** 100 million people owning 300 million guns ** i really , really , really do n't care about inner city gang members killing each other .
