   but then these stats show that 25 % of murders in the usa are family killing family . . that 's true of almost everywhere . 
   24.2 percent of victims were slain by family members ; 53.8 percent were killed by someone they knew ( acquaintance , neighbor , friend , boyfriend , etc. ) . 
  http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/80-of-victims-know-their-killers-1781009 it 's simply a truism among law enforcement and criminal statisticians ; ** most ** homicide victims had some kind of relationship to their murderer . 
  it has nothing to do with firearms . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/19-children-killed-from-12-families-when-will-family-courts-in-b/  and that ~ 70 % of murders use a handgun . 
  now you 're supposing that there is a definite overlap between domestic homicides within the us * and * homicides involving a handgun . 
  the most * anti-gun * stats i can cherry pick : http://www.vpc.org/fact_sht/domviofs.htm  in 2000 , in homicides where the weapon was known , 50 percent ( 1,342 of 2,701 ) of female homicide victims were killed with a firearm . 
  of those female firearm homicides , 1,009 women ( 75 percent ) were killed with a handgun . 
  75 % handgun homicides , of 50 % of homicides by firearm , where the victim is a female in domestic violence - - 37.5 % of domestic homicides of women in 2000 were committed by handgun . 
  something tells me that women being killed by domestic abusers with a handgun * is n't * anywhere close to the majority of who was killed by handguns ( themselves a subset of firearms ) in the us in the year 2000 , when the 90s crimewave was finally subsiding . 
   then there 's accidental deaths caused by guns too . 
  ** drop in a bucket ** i really do n't care about them when it comes to the regulation of my constitutional rights , any more than i care about pool deaths . 
  http://www.ibtimes.com/accidental-gun-deaths-involving-children-are-major-problem-us-2250568  by the end of 2015 , about 265 children under 18 picked up a firearm and shot someone by accident , and 83 of those shootings were fatal , according to research compiled by the gun control group everytown for gun safety . 
  i do n't give a fuck , because : http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/water-safety/waterinjuries-factsheet.html  from 2005-2009 , there were an average of 3,533 fatal unintentional drownings ( non-boating related ) annually in the united states -- about ten deaths per day . 
  an additional 347 people died each year from drowning in boating-related incidents . 
  frankly , ** tiny ** numbers of accidental deaths , even involving children , low incidences of legal ownership --  criminality , and the vast majority of * drug and gang related violence * driving handgun abuse , * does n't in any way * constitute an argument that i buy , that my ownership of rifles , particularly those of military pedigree ** [ used less often in homicides than hands , fists , and feet ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2009-2013.xls ) ** according to the same fbi statistics , should be further and further regulated . 
   are there any stats on how many people are killed with legal guns each year ? 
  the most extensive would be the uniform homicide crime reports from the fbi . 
  they show that , for instance , rifles of ** all ** kinds are less often used to kill people than * hands fists and feet * in the us each year , but there is n't data on legal ownership , and furthermore , * justified * vs unjustified/negligent homicide . 
  however , being a human just like you , i can draw inferences and so can you . 
  when the overwhelming majority of gun crime is committee with handguns , as are the vast majority of homicides by firearms , when they are overwhelmingly committee in inner cities with strict licensing and carriage laws , and also those cities have rampant gang and drug problems ... ... it is not a great ontological leap to presume that it 's gang members fighting over drug turf who are responsible for the great majority of handgun crimes , and indeed that * these * are also then the bulk of people committing homicides . 
  the data is unambiguous on * those * counts , though there is no nationally published registry detailing the incidence of firearms homicides committed by lawful firearms owners . 
  because the very same political left that wants to ban gun ownership to the greatest possible extent in america ** also ** does n't want to take any responsibility for what 50 years of democrat rule over america 's inner cities has produced . 
  los angeles , baltimore , dc , chicago , new orleans , camden , newark , the south bronx , etc. 
  these are not places filled with second amendment thumping rednecks who own small arsenals and wave flags and unironically wear hunter camouflage as part of their regular outfit . 
  you know - the ar-15 owners whose patriotism and exercise of the second amendment freedom everyone in this thread is mocking . 
  they do n't live in those inner city hellholes where children get shot as bystanders and intentionally over ` disrespect ' and drug dealer turf wars . 
  * they * do n't live there , those place where poverty is endemic , real , intact families do n't exist , education is derided , and criminality is * normal * . 
  but it 's where all the handgun crime happens . 
  it 's where all the drug and gang related shootings happen . 
  it 's where , if you redefine ` mass shooting ' to accommodate a drive by of rival turf , the ` mass shootings ' happen . 
  and then bingo bango , you 've conflated two things you hate , and give everyone from the europeans on this board who do n't know gun owners , to comfortable upper middle class people of the american petit bourgeois who have ever seen a gun , either , a way to shit on who they want to shit on : the * 100 million * legal gun owners who as one third of the population in a society that has always had even more prolific gun ownership , do ** nothing ** to add to the crime rate , but dare own firearms and refuse a monopoly on force . 
  but now there are some uncomfortable realities that we 'd have to talk about if we went any further . 
  we 'd have to talk about the difference between different kinds of family structures and crime . 
  different levels of educational and economic attainment and crime . 
  we 'd have to talk about the relationship of poverty and crime that makes chicago brutally violent ... . but does n't seem to make appalachia the same way ... we 'd have to talk about who instituted policies exacerbating those problems , and why . 
  and we 'd eliminate a `` sneer '' activity for europeans whose economies are in the shitter , whose shores are overwhelmed by migrants , whose militaries are paper tigers , whose fellow europeans are slaughtered by russia and ignored , because their energy consumption overrides all . 
  and then what fun is / r/europe ? 
  would 've been real awkward if scotland had left , eh ? 
  `` the united kingdom of england , wales , and northern ireland ... and cornwall ? 
  are we still doing the road signs in cornish ? '', 
  oh , then it 's even easier . 
  say that you were illegally brought here as a child from mexico , and therefore , you are double-plus entitled to remain in the us . 
   theoratically they have all those things   theoratically they have    theoratically ___________________ again , nothing you 're talking about is ** actually ** true . 
  come in illegally through mexico - - you 'll have congressmen from california fight for your right to all sorts of privileges and obama might invite you to the state of the union . 
   i know virginia was pretty large compared to other states , but was it really dominating the early us on its own , the same way people are implying germany would over an eu army ? 
  yes , it literally was . 
  it had a population of over 800k at the time , only massachusetts and pennsylvania combined beat it out . 
  north carolina and new york were the next most populous but they already had divergent economic interests . 
  ^ this is why we need a new wave of immigration from the uk holy * shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit *, 
   it seems so much against the idea of the division of power in the state the principle of ` separation of powers ' to constrain government at least in the us coexists `` freedom of speech '' that political invective can be * criminalized * in such a broad way within german legal code is * far more weird * to the us . 
  hopefully this law is heard by the courts , and invalidated . 
   eu countries are no longer sovereign nations . 
  oh , and does the eu have a military ? 
  who is the commander in chief of the eu 's military ? 
  who is the head of state of the eu ? 
  is it the same person ? 
  does that person have command authority over other eu member 's militaries ? 
   countries is a subjective term . 
  in the eu they still call them countries , despite a supremisy claus in the lisbon treaty . 
  us calls them states , despite the states having pretty much the same rights as eu countries . 
  ** dude , what ? 
  ** you 're talking about military sovereignty . 
  the states of the us ** do not have ** `` pretty much '' the same rights as eu countries . 
  eu countries are * literal nation-states * like the united states . 
  the eu is a trans-national trade and common policy area . 
  it 's not a * state *, 
   even without the senate , any single state , even california , would still be too small to dominate on its own . 
  ** that 's not true . 
  ** in fact , the reality of this situation leading to individual state domination as well as meaning there was no true federal government ** is the entire reason we adopted our constitution in 1787 , replacing the articles of confederation . 
   that 's because the nato in general has a rather stained reputation in germany and is seen by many as a mere tool of us interests . 
  that 's because nato was founded as a collective defensive pact against the soviet union , and the us was the single largest military power in the west after ww2 . 
  it 's been a long time since then , and it 's been a long time since reunification . 
  estonia can spend 2 % of gdp on a military . 
  poland is modernizing its forces and will meet 2 % soon . 
  germany does n't do shit for how much money it has . 
  nato is a tool for us interests because we 're obligated to defend all of europe , and * yet * some europeans do n't bother with their own defense . 
  because europe does n't look after european interests , american policy writes off european interests within nato . 
  all that 's left are american interests because europe literally does n't carry its own weight ( well , the baltics and poland do - and other eastern nations do more so than say , germany )  when turkey is a member go look up how many troops they contribute to the collective defensive pledge . 
  go look up how what percentage of troops that is of the whole nato alliance . 
  go look at a map and see where turkey is located in relation to russia and the middle east . 
  if you do n't like turkey 's behavior as a nato country ( who does ) , perhaps you should vote for your nation 's defense posture to be one that contributes troops , aircraft , and infrastructure to make turkey a little less relevant . 
  otherwise , as it stands , nato would be * broken * without turkey . 
  it would have next to no credibility , simply on terms of troop levels and power projection into the middle east and against russia 's footholds near the caucasus . 
   but countries like austria and sweden are n't austria chooses to free-ride germany , which chooses to free-ride nato . 
  sweden is n't part of nato , they choose to free-ride nato even more because they know that no nato nation would want to see them ( or the finns ) fall to russian aggression . 
   unlawful aggressions from members like the iraq war i think the iraq war was wrong , and shameful - - but article 5 was n't invoked . 
  it was for afghanistan ; and germany did come to afghanistan to help destroy the taliban . 
  danke  the poll was conducted in early 2014 when many germans , especially on the political left , had a more positive image of russia than today . 
  not before euromaidan or crimea , though ... 
   the reason new york and california , or bavaria in germany , do n't dominate the rest is because while they are one-to-one bigger and richer than any other single state , the rest put together are bigger and richer than them . 
  they do n't dominate because our country set up its federal national legislature to have an upper house in which all states are equally represented regardless of population or wealth and military planning is done at the federal level . 
  and their still have way more influence at the representative level and in electoral heft during presidential elections . 
  stop talking out of your ass . 
  because new york and california are n't countries . 
  and , also , nys and california 's voters * do * heavily dominate federal elections and budget contributions so their representatives , senators , and electoral votes are actually crucial when it comes to defense budgets and selection of commanders in chief and the use of force . 
  nebraska and vermont , not so much . 
  though , nys and ca ca n't simply always get their way - the senate limits them , as does individual state autonomy in their own budgets , outside the federal government . 
  also , the federal government can nationalize their guard units . 
  the eu on the other hand , with its weird financial and political system that preserves national autonomy except when it does n't and has no rule making process to constrain economically powerful states from diktat * does * clearly present a chance for franco-german domination in the financial sphere , and might present a chance for german domination in terms of military policy .
