  [ that 's being generous ] ( http://m.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/a-1038017.html#spredirectedfrom=www&amp;referrrer= ), 
  our visa policies are stupid . 
  i do n't get why the us is so willing to allow latin america to flood in ( i mean , i do ) while it tells romanians and poles to get fucked . 
    there is no way that an prominent politician would publicly support what is effectively a high profile separatist movement within a key strategic partner . 
  it defies all protocol . 
  sure there is - if an american president viewed the function of that partner as being greater outside such a union it was in ( or else its current alignment ) then they would advocate for separatism . 
  the entire history of the us presidencies during the cold war was soft and hard advocacy of separatism in political independence and martial struggle . 
  not to imply of course , that such a president would need to take so dim a view of the eu as to compare its membership as being only so much a soviet republic . 
  the question is whether it is better for the us , long term , to have the united kingdom be partly constrained in policy making and economic agency by the rule making of the european union , or be freer to act ( and fail ) in political and economic objectives outside of it . 
  the current us president and most of the current political establishment is not interested in nationalism in terms of either trade or polity - obama splits with both the tea party and much of the progressive wing of the democratic party and sides with the gop and democratic establishment on the tpp for instance . 
  it 's entirely conceivable that a further right wing us politician , albeit not being able to tell juncker or lagarde or whoever to tear down any wall , might well sympathize greatly with nigel farage and on a variety of issues , rather see a uk that was freer to act in step with ( his view of ) us interests over european continental ones . 
  obama is very much not going to advocate anything but eu solidarity , because of his own , his party 's own , and his administration 's own ideological viewpoint , but it 's totally possible the us will have different leadership on that issue in time . 
  hey , but there 's the american example !, 
  by banning popular sporting rifles for their pistol grips and ergonomic stocks , and requiring pistol licensing and banning magazines of a certain size , several states and cities have completely eliminated drug and gang related shootings , and concretely prevented mass shootings by deranged kids and terrorists - particularly california , whose laws are stricter than several european nations in many respects and which boasts incredibly safe cities with little gun crime committed by any kind of shooter , gang member , angry young man , or islamic terrorist . 
  i mean , how can * anyone * be skeptical of common sense gun laws at this point ? 
  just like the terrorist and organized crime use of encryption , and just how we 've all learned the great value of giving up our digital privacy forever , i think everyone should realize that civilian firearms ownership is just * too dangerous * not to let the government pass meaningful laws which will protect us in the long term . 
  the leaders of our nations definitely only want what 's best for the eu and us when they simultaneously make significant pushes for both the control of civilians owned firearms and greater surveillance powers of telecommunications . 
  why else could they make such an effort . 
  we 're so paranoid sometimes . 
  i do n't think it 's so weird . 
  ultimately , humans want to have their own kids , and they want to raise their own kids , and they want their kids to be supported and they want their kids to feel loved and grow up in a stable household and they do n't like sharing their kids with strangers . 
  this is just how it is . 
  yet , in order to have children and have children that are supported and have children who are raised in a stable way and have their own children , both men and women ( women only to a very * slightly * less true extent because they do now legally and socially have the option of deliberate single motherhood , something which is also very novel in the west ) literally require other people to be their sexual partner , their financial partner , and their life partner . 
  that 's just true - there is some negotiation of time over which the stranger becomes the socially announced boy/girl friend becomes the sexual partner , becomes the socially announced fiancee/fiance becomes the husband/wife becpems the mother/father . 
  that 's actually not so easy to do , emotionally , financially when you 're 34 and they 're 34 and both of you have failed to do this ten or twelve times in the past - - - - and for women , biologically . 
  and there 's much less time to share the life experiences and life stages that make for a strong stable bond between man and woman that the child will perceive as `` father '' and `` mother '' because of this as well . 
  i do n't think you can divorce sexual partner number from delay of marriage from lack of experience in persisting with relationships to time within a life span ( early 20s vs early 30s ) and opportunities for unique and shared trust ... from marriage . 
  i was actually pointing out merely the time delay before ( which carries with it the incidence of greater numbers of intimate partners , humans having a natural need for intimacy ) but since most people who get married so so before they 're around 30 and no longer around 18 or 20 , but because most people who have sex do so before they 're 18 or 20 and not 30 ( which is the huge component of sexual vs marital morality that 's changed ) actually now i think it idols be not just a small part , but an intrinsically determinative factor . 
  uncomfortable thought , but i think some data would bear out our current generation is the least likely to marry/most likely to have a lot of unmarried or late married . 
  ceska zeme or something ? 
  czechland in english sounds nice to me , just like england , or saying deutschland over germany . 
  people ` play the field ' for longer with more partners and marry later while also pursuing travel and leisure for longer periods of their youth , thus the window for realistically having children ( largely supported in a marriage of earning couples ) is much smaller . 
  edit : in the us , at least , the ww2 generation had an * average * lifetime number of sexual partners of three . 
  many ( perhaps most ) people literally never slept with anyone but their spouse , and marriages happened in the early 20s . 
  the sexual revolution generation , the baby boomers , took that up to around 12 , as well as having way more divorces . 
  the next generation about the same , though a lower marriage rate , and the millennial generation is lower ( still vastly higher than the ww2 generation , and with no taboo on premarital sex ) and its marriage rate is currently * super * low , and on track to stay much lower than any prior generation as well as to marry far later . 
  not tax them so heavily when the result of unprotected sex can be children for a family , and future finnish workers and citizens . 
  no need to outright pay them ; just do n't take so much of their money away now - it 's an investment in the future of the country , even if it is a ` cost ' to the government budget . 
   the us simply tolerates whatever russia decides to do , as often as it likes ? 
  whatever they decide to do ? 
  i 'm pretty sure if they sunk a us vessel , icbms would be fueled up in anticipation of glassing moscow in the event of war . 
  the us , imho , sees no value in confronting russia about a local issue like this , when on issues * far * more important to the us 's interests , which themselves come with defense obligations to europe against russia , there is no european will to push diplomatic and economic terms against russia . 
   while the us does n't have the stomach to hold russia accountable for this clown behavior ** nonsense ** this is n't about whether the us is willing to protect its own sailors . 
  if the united kingdom were to violate our territory with aircraft like this and her majesty could n't explain it , raf pilots would risk death , too . 
  nato nations in western europe have already openly stated they 'd be hesitant to defend eastern europe/the baltics , and already are n't spending a bare minimum to have a force capable of doing so . 
  western europe and the polity that is the eu is n't taking a hardline on russia with sanctions . 
  the us is demonized for taking unilateral actions against russia 's proxy in syria . 
  what support or coalition would be there if we shot down russian aircraft for behaving badly ? 
  if we shot down ( possibly unarmed ) russian air assets in international waters/airspace , which european powers would back us up if russia then went full throttle on our friendlies in syria ? 
  in kurdistan/turkey ? 
  which european powers could we rely on if russian regular troops moved against with the intent to capture/kill us forces in ukraine ? 
  the eu is filled with a bunch of complete fucking pussies who do absolutely ** nothing ** for their fellow european ukranians , and their fellow european georgians , and their fellow european poles , estonians , latvians , lithuanians , and romanians - whether it 's non-eu/nato and literal killing/occupation , or eu/nato members and statements about not defending them/and not spending enough . 
  no matter what , western europe wo n't look past short term energy arrangments and the pretend policy of appeasement . 
  this is n't a question of american will or capability . 
  we could conquer or annihilate all human life within the western hemisphere . 
  the issue is whether outside core us security interests , the us has allies and causes worth fighting for . 
  right now , i 'm not so sure we do . 
  for the sake of appeasing the fair weather diplomatic whining of europe , risking american kias by shooting down some errant russian airplanes is not worth it , for me , for most of the voting public , and clearly not for the xo on that vessel . 
  that 's why europe needs to step it up on sanctions . 
  either putin , with these flybys , with ukraine , with syria , is someone the west will do business with , or he is n't . 
  the west is either going to cut his nation off , or it is n't . 
  that 's what this comes down to - not whether the us navy is going to adopt policies from state department about shooting down russian planes flying low . 
  as it stands , ** far worse ** than this incident is * totally acceptable * to the vast majority of european nations ' governments . 
  crimea is acceptable , the donbass is acceptable , saber rattling towards the baltics is acceptable , support for bashir al-assad is acceptable . 
  all of this , is far worse , than a pair of aircraft buzzing a single ship . 
  and none of it has turned off long term willingness of europe , particularly western europe , to do business with putin . 
  sanctions are really the only choice , ones which would break the russian economy , and break putin 's oligarchy support and popular support , but europe wo n't go for it . 
  there 's no point to a conversation about whether or not the us navy is going to shoot down a russian aircraft in international waters/airspace , if europe and most of nato is basically unwilling to defend alliance members , spend any real money , or merely cease doing business with russia over something like ukraine . 
  i agree . 
  this is also why i do n't buy liberal arguments in america about the situation of poor black people being totally a result of historical or institutional racism . 
  those are very real factors , but it 's not like poor asian people did n't immigrate here . 
  it 's not like poor italians and poles did n't immigrate here . 
  it 's not like there are n't * still * poor people immigrating here and making futures for themselves . 
    if the others can do , why ca n't the immigrants from mena do it ? 
  maybe because they simply do n't want ? 
  partly . 
  i suspect another factor is like what we have in the us . 
  once you have a large spanish speaking population , english acquisition plummets because they basically form a parallel society . 
  you can literally live at any stage of life in miami and never once speak english . 
  it 's not good for unity , long term . 
  legit , this sort of thing is why my family came to america . 
  civic nationalism is loads better than ethnic nationalism for this reason . 
  censorship is only allowable under the 1a in * extreme * cases . 
  go read a little bit more than a single wikipedia link . 
  go read about our supreme court decisions . 
  nothing like an index of disallowed media content exists into which musical groups can be placed ad hoc so that their commercial proliferation is censored on * moral * grounds by an unelected government board . 
  i mean , jesus , even writing that . 
  you ca n't see how that 's a really bad structure to legally create ? 
  none of this shit is being made for westerners who speak english , or even russians who speak english . 
  it 's being made for the great russian public . 
  this stuff is there for the russians who are men that have either been conscripts or will be , who are angry , not so educated , and given to the vatnik-esque ramblings of `` but russia is most strongk ! '', 
  the phonathon shit with putin is for housewives to call in and show adoration to putin . 
  when he goes to some mid level industrial board and throws a pen on a desk for some government appointee to sign an agreement ( with tv cameras rolling ) it 's for yet another segment of russian society . 
  the message is always the same , even if the presentation is blaring ` the sacred war ' during a march for old people during a ww2 parade , or making slick videos about ukraine and isis that disparage the notion of russia being an aggressor . 
  ( search : russia , aggressor on youtube , it 'll come up , it 's made for young kids , esp young boys to be enthralled by ) everything from an updated version of ` if only comrade stalin knew ! ', 
  so that inherent abuses and corruption are dissociated from the regime , to constantly blaming western intrigue and sabotage of the russian-project to make the complete lack of progress in economy and heavy toll of foreign intervention always seem like a cost imposed from the outside . 
  it does n't matter that there are typos or grammatical errors ( or that cia memorandum are written as a perfect mirror of the complaints of russia 's politicians with * zero * self awareness ) , because the russians that this was made for do n't know or read english , wo n't learn , and wo n't hear about or else care to investigate anyone pointing out errors on vkontakte or whatever . 
  they 'll share this `` documentary '' people will say ` aha , of course the cia did it !, 
  america is always hurting russia , they do n't want us to be strong '' and then that 's that . 
  where western audiences * delight * in the idea of breaking their own society 's mythologies of power and goodness and traditional morality ( which has its own problems , for sure ) , a tendency that inoculates them against propaganda , russian audiences * revel * in the mythology of the kievan rus ' , the czar , the orthodox church , stalin , and the post-yeltsin federation of putin , because it is a story of * russian power * - - - the strength of their ( definitive and best ) slavic blood , the solidarity of their anti-capitalist/anti - indulgence virtues , and the virtue of their orthodox and true moral fiber with definitely no homosex .
