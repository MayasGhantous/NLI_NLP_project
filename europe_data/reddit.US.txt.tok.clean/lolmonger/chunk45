  i 've seen too many foreign commentators confused about why putin seems to be rehabilitating stalin , but is also so buddy buddy with the church . 
  it 's * not * contradictory , for this reason . 
  he is syncretizing all of the russian mythology of virtue - powerful goodness - past present and future , and western depravity , cunning , and anti-russian attitude , into the zeitgeist of himself and his presidency . 
   with all thats happening during the trump campaign , and i 'm not talking about his supporters , i 'm talking about the people that are terrified by chalk , people that condone violence against others that wear trump hats/support him , people that are trying to stop his ralleys by blocking high ways as a trump supporter , yes , i agree those people are shitty and should be arrested . 
  but also the 1a is there to forbid government from making indices such as this one . 
  i 've been a fan of rammstein for a long time , from when i * was * a kid . 
  i looked up and read the lyrics , i found juvenile pleasure in it then , just listening pleasure now . 
  there 's no satanic augur of moral corruption that music brings . 
  the lyrics are what they are - they are n't wholesome or anything ( and by the way , ich tu dir weh is n't the worst : rammstein really does have songs about brother sister , father daughter incest , and necrophilia that are even grosser ) , but that 's hardly a standard for government to be able to impose commercial muzzling . 
  if you can literally sell sex , why not sing about taboos ? 
  * dude * why is there such an index ? 
  that is what i think is terrible . 
   i have n't hear of famine among refugees in sweden , so those that have been there for 15 years and are not working are getting their three square meals a day somehow . 
  because they probably bounce around between odd jobs and welfare and live in poor conditions . 
  they do n't have , as the headline states , regular jobs . 
  they simply do n't have continuous , gainful employment . 
   in 2009 , the federal department for media harmful to young persons , a german governmental agency responsible for listing works that could potentially harm youths , had decided that one of the songs of the album , `` ich tu dir weh , '' as well as the pictures in the booklet accompanying the cd , were `` brutalizing '' and `` immoral . '', 
  the entire album was indexed . 
  okay , so of * all * the songs on that album , they picked that one ? 
  ich tu dir weh has lyrics that invoke bdsm and pain play , because rammstein has always made that kind of music . 
  juvenile , perverted , angry , and loud music about sex and death and taboos * is their entire schtick . 
  * and does this mean rammstein 's songs about incest and necrophilia are cool ? 
  moral ? 
  and not harmful ? 
  and that 's the basis for saying people can not sell things in germany ? 
  prostitution is legal in germany , but * talking * about things and playing loud music along with it has to be restricted ? 
  this is a stupid , anti-free speech law . 
  there 's another submission on / r/europe right now about `` european '' values and free speech - - - what free speech ? 
  as far as i can tell , between the twitter-police in several nations , and germany 's crazy speech laws , the eu does n't really have any common values that put rights of expression before state censor interest . 
  it only has a population which at present , does n't yet run afoul too often of what the state wishes to censor . 
  whether they 're genuine refugees is n't the issue . 
  it 's entirely possible that people who * only * want to come to europe to earn money and send it back home could learn the language and integrate - - in fact , this is generally the story of immigration that appeases * most * people . 
  it 's also entirely possible for someone from syria to flee war , and 15 years on , having only learnt subsistence level swedish because it 's hard to learn a new language at 30 as a broke former bricklayer , finds themselves an unemployable ex-construction worker whose skills and experience are irrelevant to swedish building codes and practice , and whose compounded decade and a half of poverty have n't really pointed them towards a situation where they can claw out of poverty . 
  * that * situation can happen to a `` genuine '' refugee , too . 
  besides all of this , the * real * problem is that all across europe , just like the roma previously , and unlike inter-european migration , there are now parallel societies of people who ** do n't ** want to integrate - - - not just that they ca n't . 
  that 's * far * more pernicious than a `` genuine '' refugee who just is n't good at language learning , and has no real skill . 
  on top of it , unless europe puts a lot of money and effort into making the places where all migrants -- genuine refugees or not - - are coming from safe enough to send people back in good conscious , and unless europe puts a lot of political capital into stemming un-assimilable flow , this shit is just going to worsen . 
   shakira law yes please, 
   i think the overall problem is that usa hasnt figured out what to do with itself after 1989 , and it hasnt set clear political aims for itself . 
  i completely agree . 
  the sad thing is that what started as a master plan has gotten to this . 
  the height of american control were the decades of aramco and the shah . 
  if carter had been more forceful in protecting our allies ( a failure to do so that i think reagan/bush committed in afghanistan , and obama in egypt ) , we would have had two regimes representing the pinnacle of sunni arab and shiite persian/iraqi sympathetic power within our hands . 
  imagine the iran iraq war never happening , imagine the gulf war never happening , imagine the baathists of iraq never being scattered ( because they never fought radicalized shiite iran ) and turning into isis - a middle east where faisal is sitting on one third , the shah on another third , and saddam on still another , between them containing the fractious kurds , the sunnis , and the shiites . 
  it all went wrong in the late 70s , early 80s , despite the success of afghanistan , and by then the monsters of sunni islam like ubl and his ilk were already targeting the us . 
   the fabulous guantanamo bay resort we have * water boarding * for * radical * people here . 
  get all of the information possible out of him and then keep him in a dark hole until he dies . 
  i noticed they had protesters playing both ultra nationalists and communists with the russian flag and one that had the hammer and sickle ... and * also * had signboards with mcdonald 's and coca cola on them . 
  it would be one thing if we were just appeasing them over there . 
  too many wealthy saudis are sponsoring wahhabist mosques abroad and spreading salafist filth in the west . 
  the regime needs a firm newspaper smack on the head from the western world , and to have its nose rubbed in its waste , and be put in the crate . 
  otherwise they 'll keep taking a lackadaisical approach with jihadists and the radical clerics , keep allowing radical islam to infiltrate our countries , and essentially keep shitting on the carpet . 
  `` by law , you must keep this rifle in your home and be conscripted into the military in defense of switzerland !, 
  * grunt * also , if you get a guinea pig , get two , because they get lonely , okay ? '', 
  my kind of people . 
  thanks for not being condescending , truly . 
  i am aware of the difference , i was just pointing out that vox 's readership ( in america ) is basically composed of literally only those people who would agree or else are expats themselves . 
   this is exactly what liberal parties in europe want . 
  * boy , would n't it have been convenient for you if someone had previously explained why it was obvious someone in america writing about an american authored piece on american attitudes towards taxes invoked ` liberal ' not to mean classical liberty prioritizing ideology , but the contemporary american political usage of the word ? 
  *  you 're in / r/europe and believe it or not some things have different meanings to americans and europeans . 
  * oh man , and maybe that comment could 've directly made clear awareness of the difference in those terms , despite the commentary being in english , about an american political attitude *  your comment reeks of american arrogance . 
  and yours of a single individual 's obtuse pedantry and make-believe sanctimony . 
  this is * reddit * , first of all , everyone knew exactly what i was saying , and clearly still does now . 
   `` liberal '' does n't equate left wing in europe !, 
  i 'm aware of this , just as i 'm aware that you are aware i do n't speak polish , but english . 
  the reason you are writing in english is because you know that 's the language i 'm most likely to understand . 
  do you know why i used ` liberal ' in the contemporary american english understanding of it to mean a person who advocates for greater government economic involvement and higher taxes ? 
  * because that 's what this article is about . 
  *  we are talking economics here , there is nothing liberal about social programs and high taxes . 
  now you 're just completely wrong . 
  the people who have a set of value judgements that say ` social welfare programs ' ( this is what you meant to write , but did n't ) are not only merited , but so much a policy imperative because of those values primacy over others , for society to compel high payments from taxpayers , ** are the left wing ** , in every country . 
  just as the ** right wing ** have their economic policy choices informed by a value structure that * deprioritizes * social welfare programs for the sake of * lower * taxes , and also to fulfil a value structure that rejects the idea of collective aid , and prioritizes individual competition . 
  this is literally * the * definining tension between left and right wing , a collectivist and pro social value structure against an competitive and pro individual one . 
  you 're trying to divorce policy choices from the values which create differentials in policy choices in the first place . 
  ** every ** policy choice is made because of fundamental values making the other choices unappealing . 
  so , i will buy that in a european context , calling vox `` liberal '' might not fit . 
  ... but i do n't think that you 're so ignorant as to be unaware why pointing out vox ( an american outlet ) publishing a piece written by an american talking about their reappraisal of american political values is `` liberal '' , that you did n't know what i was talking about , or that there 's some mysterious set of conditions which are n't those political values that creates policy choices . 
  vox is a liberal rag that just pushes this shit all the time . 
  the kind of american who reads it seriously and would agree with this article is also the kind to become an expatriate/have already agreed with this values judgement of policy in the first place . 
   the glasgow shopkeeper was a member of the islamic sect persecuted in pakistan for decades . 
  how did the arcane but deadly tensions , rooted in the theological history of the region , surface in the uk ? 
  because muslims who think the ahmadis are n't muslims and should be killed for heresy against islam now live in the uk , not just pakistan . 
  the answer is in the question . 
  that might be true , but the american political establishment in the senate , state department , defense department and justice department , along with the separate judiciary and state legislatures are simply outside of the presidency 's control . 
  furthermore , even if critiques of the two men on personality are true ( i think they are ) ; https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/trials_and_allegations_involving_silvio_berlusconi berlusconi is * clearly * way worse than the donald , or really * any * us federal politician i can think of . 
  on top of that , there 's a reason italy had/has problems with the mafia and organized crime to the extent that it did/does , and that 's just deeply operating social/political corruption . 
  the us has scandalous politicians like blagojevich , it 's true , but we do n't have prosecutors getting murdered , or centuries long histories of organized crime : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27ndrangheta for that reason , ( and this works with trump 's not so in-apt putin comparisons , too ) , it 's really not a useful criticism of trump to point out that his personality and his bluster and his larger than life attitude resemble some other politician . 
  political results in the us happen because of a completely different society and process than exists in italy ( or russia ), 
  the * pursuit * of them , on the other hand ... 
  that does n't change the fact that this is just for show - - all we 're doing is reaffirming to our baltic/eastern nato partners that we 're not going to sell them out if russia ever does attack them , and russia that we 're pretty good at getting a lot of troops somewhere quickly , and that almost everyone to the west of them likes us way better . 
  that 's all this comes down to , but it 's still expensive , takes focus from our real task ( which should be preparing for a militarized china in the pacific ) , and honestly , should ** really ** be done by the western european nations that are nato members themselves . 
   you did mess up afghanistan which was controlled by the taliban , which sheltered al-quaida and bin laden . 
   make it worse . 
  hardly . 
   you did mess up iraq one of the most brutal dictatorships in modern history , headed up by a guy who gassed and artillery bombed at least 50,000 men women and children to death  you certainly helped make syria worse no , assad reacting like so many other despots to his people revolting with force did that , as well as isis . 
   so when are you guys going to take your share of the refugees you guys created ? 
  just as soon as european colonialism in the middle east from sykes-picot onwards means there are free tickets to their polities for aggrieved descendants . 
  and let 's be real ; * the terrorism is happening because of sunni islam 's wahhabism * that 's it . 
   anyone here will care what the us thinks about nato there is no nato without the us . 
  the us owns it and you know it .
