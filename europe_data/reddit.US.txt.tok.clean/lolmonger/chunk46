   with all its tanks , ifvs , supercarriers , air power and even nuclear weapons could not and did not `` defeat '' a ragtag collection of ak-wielding guerilla in afghanistan we could , if we could elect presidents who would be willing to be brutal . 
  we did n't have most of that stuff when the us crushed nazi germany , but we were willing to be brutal and use white phosphorus as an anti-personnel weapon in those days . 
  my contention is that the us and europe need to enact the same level of brutality against isis , as was done to nazi germany .

  this is just rebranding and reorganizing . 
  they 're combining mvd units and omon into something that parses more friendly for anglophones than `` internal ministry troops '' or the like . 
  they did this with cops not being called ` militsya ' , too . 
  it 's to pare down on what it sounds like in western press when they interact with protesters or respond to an emergency , and also to reorganize soviet command structures into more modern ones . 
  there is * so * much crazy shit that putin has done ; this is not part of it . 
   so basically everyone is pissed , but none one actually wants to dissolve nato . 
  trump does . 
  imagine if all the european polities screaming at everyone else to take in refugees ... * spent a little more on their militaries * so that we could actually defeat isis and end the war decisively .

   you still feel perfectly save in germany .

  why are you male shaming ? 
  plenty of women conceive without being married * or * self sufficient and require government support , without such laws as in france . 
  the marriage rate has been plummeting , it 's the biggest driver of the divorce rate finally going down - - - and it 's men who pop the question in almost every western society . 
  more men have basically realized that marriage is pretty risky , but long term exclusive dating and having babies when you 're ** really ** sure about the relationship is closer to `` real '' marriage than the legal abomination paper-marriages have become .

   the original article uses the term modersm\u00e5l , which is pretty much the language you speak at home . 
  this also does n't necessarily mean that there are few people of finnish descent , just that they ( and/or their kids ) have been in the country long enough to be more comfortable speaking swedish . 
  this is the point , though . 
  those people of finnish descent have become * nativized * their modersm\u00e5l , their mother tongue , their ` native ' tongue * is swedish * even as people of finnish ethnic origin . 
  * do you think that is going to happen for second and third generation arabic speakers who have surpassed finnish speakers in sweden ? 
   it 's like no one knows how to do threat assessment . 
  ever wondered why the western world 's ` educated ' and wealthy drive a lot of the reemergence of vaccine preventable disease ? 
   especially since it 's a bumfuckistan of a country nobody on the grand level cares about ? 
  it 's worse - - if it were a bumfuckistan , they 'd all be screaming wir schaffen das and letting ukrainians in by the millions, 
   pis in bed with catholic church i wonder who wrote that . 
  i 'm a native speaker of english , and i 've always understood that idiom to mean a revelation of * illicit * cooperation between parties who are otherwise discreet about their cooperation . 
  ( like how politics can make strange bedfellows because of necessity ) pis and poland 's right in general seem * deeply * and * obviously * catholic . 
  who is surprised ? 
  did n't pis * win an election * on this stuff ? 
   when should an unborn baby have the right to life ?

  assume just 1 % of that 30 % are committed to jihad . 
  what 's changed about european intelligence and law enforcement ? 
  the paris and brussels attackers were n't complete unknowns to the services . 
  they were n't shadow people who never interacted with things like airports and refugee registrations . 
  they had ids . 
  they had real names and faces that people knew . 
  they had places to stay , they had vehicles . 
  they also came back from abroad , and most , i believe , were native europeans in a legal sense of origin . 
  they know your languages , they have freedom of movement , they have sympathetic communities to hide in , they know how to load and fire weapons , and build bombs . 
  they know how to communicate among themselves , and they know how to act in hate . 
  so what is going to happen ? 
  because if nothing changes , and even 1 % of this 30 % who come back are committed to jihad , some capital in europe is fucked . 
  even if we accept this premise , it 's still overwhelmingly people from a mena/heritage muslim background who are first becoming radicalized , then flocking to radical islam . 
  how far back does he want to kick this can ?

  this is why i * do n't * hate muslims . 
  this shopkeeper was a muslim . 
  he loved his country and his people and is widely reported as having been a completely lovable chum who ran a store , gave kids candies , and flirted with older women . 
  the problem , are those muslims who have a problem with muslims like * him * . 
  who would * kill * him and praise his killer . 
  the west ought do whatever it can to support muslims like him . 
  so long as none of that soccer-nationalism turns into real nationalism , though , and so long as people do n't feel inspired by national anthems off the pitch , europe will be safe !, 
  they 're overselling the image of trump as crazy , when he 's actually just being vague . 
  they 're just trying to make him look shitty instead of merely bombastic . 
  i can imagine situations in which they might nuke us . 
  how we arrive to those circumstances from the present is n't clear , but hardly impossible . 
  of course he ca n't . 
  `` unimaginable '' situations in the 2012 election included russia invading ukraine and shooting down passenger jets filled with dutch people . 
  imagine someone telling you in 2012 that ukrainians would hate russia within 5 years because of a military annexation of part of their country . 
  that dozens and dozens of eu citizens , civilians , would be murdered by russian separatists within 5 years . 
  obama savaged romney in the debates on the matter of russia , and won plaudits from the media for his modernity in rejecting cold war mistrust and for pooh pooing russia 's relevance as a geopolitical threat . 
  what the fuck do people even think any nation has nukes for ? 
  not ruling out their use is * the point * . 
   there is some law that permits them to go after relatives ... especially financially . 
  rico laws in the us were often used to break up crime families , especially those which were literally families , so that a mobster could n't transfer his cash to relatives , in order to further break incentives for law breaking and non-cooperation with authorities . 
  i dunno if you can totally extend that to * targeting * the families of terrorists for the same kind of actions . 
  nyt is kind of overselling things here . 
  obama literally * did * authorize a drone strike that not only killed an american , anwar al-awlaki , but also his completely innocent 16 year old american son ( accidentally ) , and has authorized other drone strikes that have had plenty of children living in the same houses as terrorists blown up along with the targets . 
  trump has n't ( as per usual ) gone into any specifics at all about what targeting the families of terrorists means .

   russian protectorate , american protectorate , same difference .

  reunification was not so long ago , have you really forgotten ? 
  there 's a pretty big difference . 
  and a lot of chetniks had what we called an `` ethnic cleansing obsession '', 
  these sound like debit cards . 
  i use my credit card for stuff i know will cost a lot , and which i know i 'm going to pay , like bills and rent and planned large expenses . 
  it 's sitting in a drawer with my financial papers . 
  my debit card , and my checking account + phone payment are what actually go out of the house with me , along with cash . 
  i dunno if the germans are like this , but when i 'm not carefully planning ` necessary ' expenses and ` critical ' expenses within the budget , but am just spending on extras and incidentals , i like that to be something which is real money in the here and now , with a hard physical limit in what i 'm carrying with me , and a numerical amount i can look at on my phone . 
  eastern europe came with us to afghanistan and iraq , and even though they 've had less than three decades of remove from the soviet and warsaw boot , they 're all seriously committing to nato .
