  if we bolster their security , they can get to the work of what nations * really * ought do ; educate their people to do productive labor , and produce for their families so people can live well and trade with others . 
  they need help . 
  it 's not like lithuania and estonia are just going to discover a shit ton of lithuanians and estonians in the next two years , add them to the workforce and tax rolls and start building things and providing services . 
  they all have really harsh security concerns , and their nextdoor neighbor is not a friendly one , and they 've done what they can for us and nato . 
  why not help them ? 
  poland is the second safest oecd country , safer than germany , their own currency , on track to meet 2 % gdp for nato and undergoing a force modernization . 
  give it another generation or two ; they 're going to be in a better position than germany . 
  they 're going to be the fucking south korea of europe . 
   there could be some intelligence official that has prevented the deaths of hundreds if not thousands and well never know who they are . 
  oh , there undoubtedly is . 
  i would n't ever want to give the impression i disrespect these groups , even if i have privacy gripes with them . 
  they 're signed up to do an inherently thankless and sometimes dangerous task . 
  what you should do then , is import lots of non-german people , young old , whoever , and tax the native german population to provide for them if they ca n't earn . 
  also for all the public services they 'll consume . 
  and then , when they do under the table work and otherwise displace as many native germans at the low end of the economic scale working in low skill labor , while also occupying more and more of the lower tier property market , their increased consumption will boost gdp and they 'll buy consumer products naturally and so you can get sales taxes and more buyers , and probably if they come from places that are n't western and you can bring along women from there , all the kids native germans do n't have because they ca n't earn much or buy property , can instead be had in greater numbers by these folks , whose cultures vastly deemphasize female education and earning and independence . 
  it 's ** fool proof ** , i tell ya !, 
  i 'm not saying they 're `` incompetent '' in the sense of them being idiots ( though american officials ' commentary on the belgian services is awfully unkind ) - - but developing competency in the sense of everything from deep institutional knowledge and shared years of experience , to best practices in sharing information and recruiting the next generation of personnel is itself a task before these agencies - - - * not * just the actual task at hand , and i think they 're trying to do two things at once , basically . 
  https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2010-featured-story-archive/cia-values-language-capabilities.html can you imagine where we would 've been in the cold war if we had so few fluent speakers of russian or polish that we had to put out hiring bonuses ? 
   authorities ca n't do that because we have a ton of privacy protections legally . 
  oh , i totally agree , and that 's actually the other half of my discontent . 
  the 4th amendment is n't something our nation 's founders wrote into the deepest level of our law on a lark . 
  i do n't like the idea of an omniscient and omnipotent surveillance and law enforcement authority , even if it 's `` ours '' . 
  my complaint is mostly that it seems like a lot of western intelligence agencies are just currently underprepared and unprepared , and their institutional focus should really invest way , way more into developing themselves and their capacities before taking on so much . 
  a lot of the special units of the us military , from the special forces to the seals , really only existed from the mid to late 50s onwards . 
  they became what we now know them as in the last couple of decades . 
  the cia is a post ww2 creation as well , and i just think that the military , so often used in post-cold war efforts , has actually developed a great deal of institutional knowledge and competency in how it fights . 
  just my one cent though ; i had the absolute lowest level of civilian clearance and was a clerk , essentially . 
  and the svr tipped the fbi off about the tsarnaev brothers . 
  i think everyone has to start accepting that the authorities are n't as competent as we like to think they are , and that they 're still developing protocols on everything from collecting intelligence to analyzing it to sharing it to acting on it . 
  a long time ago , i had an internship with an ic contractor while interning for my congressman , himself on an ic committee . 
  it was a cool experience , but there 's just so much bloat . 
  i was basically a glorified editor and brief preparer with a security clearance so i could be in the same room as people i was doing office shit for . 
  i learned a lot , but it 's not like i was getting * any * real preparation to do those sorts of things , and i did n't see much that really told me that people had industry specific knowledge and depth of experience exclusive to that work . 
  it 's a lot of bloat and bureaucracy . 
  that i was even doodling around was probably part of the problem . 
  it was and remains little more than a cool resume padder , but it really changed how much faith i have in the decision making of a lot of these agencies . 
  i bet gru/dia/whoever are really , really good at figuring out what kind of forces need to be deployed where and when given satellite imagery of x nation 's armored columns on a certain date moving in a certain direction . 
  that 's a game that 's been played by nations since hot air balloon 's were observatory craft . 
  since we had telegrams . 
  and obviously , the operations side of any nation 's military is going to be super . 
  but i do n't think the way nation 's intelligence is set up can really cope with the big data problems of finding terrorists , people at risk of radicalization and stopping them before they 're a threat . 
  even law enforcement struggles with preventing drug trafficking because it 's such a hidden in humans problem . 
  i do n't have the answers , but so often , the people who commit terrorism were known to some authorities well before they did anything , sometimes even exactly the ones charged with stopping them in their jurisdiction . 
  this is half of why i resent more mass collection and privacy violation . 
  they do n't need a bigger haystack . 
   could be in bad taste so , right up ch 's alley . 
  it 's incredibly mischievous and honest . 
  brutally so . 
   honestly though , i am happy that not everyone can just buy a shotgun in supermarket . 
  the super wal-mart back in my hometown has both a produce section , * and * a sporting goods section . 
  since they operate as commercial firearms dealers , everyone has a background check - - but you can indeed do grocery/ammunition shopping all in one go . 
  i dunno , i kind of like that feature of our culture . 
  during university , i took some of my foreign friends back to visit and they were appalled/intrigued . 
  i 'm one of those sorts of americans who owns guns for self defense , and because the constitution says so because the state should n't have any monopoly on force . 
  europeans should have rights of self defense , and the czech republic has ** way ** better gun laws than many us states in almost every respect except the technical status of a * right * to keep and bear arms ... ... but europe 's problems are n't ones that require people taking up arms in their own country in a reactionary way , just yet . 
  i think it 'd be better to invest more in pro-natalist policies , strong border policies , strong immigration policies , and harsher , better funded policing and intelligence . 
  the nazis did everyone the favor of having a political apparatus with uniforms and buildings , and a military with uniforms and formations . 
  so that 's like middle school ? 
  i dunno - - it 's a very special cohort of eleven year olds who will take an interest in programming . 
  i 'd rather see something like python ( or whatever , something that has a lot of syntactical pleasantness ) classes being offered , with students who 've shown some prior aptitude encouraged to take them electively ( esp . 
  if they might otherwise be discouraged ) i kind of view school as a more formalized and more intense version of what parents are supposed to do with instruction . 
  when they 're little , if you just buy them a piano and tell them to play it , they 're going to dabble , get frustrated , and stop . 
  if you notice your kid loves music and is taken with a piano performance , maybe start sending him to lessons and encourage him when he realizes chords are hard . 
  just throwing gadgets and hype at kids is n't going to do much . 
  well , i 've scarcely been * alive * for more than two decades . 
  i 'm just saying that :   damn it portugal , make babies  it 's up to the women . 
  they are the bottleneck . 
  this is n't an unreasonable exchange or something . 
  it pretty much is the choice of women whether and when and to whom they say `` yes '' when it comes to sex , when it comes to marriage , and when it comes to pregnancy ( happening or continuing ) it 's just biology - - if there 's some social prerogative for lots of babies , then i guess that 's something society is going to look to women to solve . 
  if there 's one factory making batter by the hundreds of gallons every day , and another factory making ovens every other week , there 's gon na be a limit on cakes , and it 's * not the batter factory * which is rate-limiting . 
  fault ? 
  no one 's assigning blame . 
  but it 's simply true that women are the portion of the population that choose whether or not sex leads to babies . 
  that 's what the `` choice '' in abortion discussions refers to . 
  women in the west have largely delayed marrying , delayed having children , and have fewer children , later , if at all , than women in the west previously had . 
   you 'd think after operation iraqi `` freedom '' oh for sure !, 
  the absolute turnaround of the left in the us just blows my mind . 
  it 's one thing to run into a conservative who still rationalizes the bush years ' war policies . 
  but then i see * liberals * and even * progressives * giving obama a complete fucking pass , and it 's like , who are you people ? 
  how did you get in my country ? 
   what exactly do you expect obama to do in syria , go against the entire foreign policy establishment and stop backing the jihadis ? 
  i mean , yeah ? 
  he 's the commander in chief the entire american foreign policy establishment * answers to him * , and he 's supposed to answer to * us * ; that 's the point . 
   his own legacy the most awful motivation , and the one that keeps seeing obama do retarded shit . 
  things you need first : 1 ) a european people , with a single language and identity 2 ) a european polity , with a single federal government 3 ) a european currency , with a single monetary and budgetary policy 4 ) a european military , under the singular control of 2 ) financed by 3 ) _________________ k , once you have all of that , then you can build an intelligence apparatus that works in partner with the martial and economic and political interests of europe , on issues anywhere from intelligence collection to clandestine action to political advisement , and you 'll have a `` european cia '' http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/7836423/nutella-threatened-by-eu-label-laws-italians-claim.html ^ this , * this * is the level of european dysfunction in policy making , in national interests , and priorities . 
  is it any surprise that libya , that the euro crisis , that the response to isis and the migrant crisis , dealing with russian military actions in ukraine , and russian political overtures towards eastern europe , etc. 
  have gone the way they have ? 
  what is europe ? 
  what does the `` european '' language sound like ? 
  how do its verbs conjugate ? 
  how do the nouns decline , and what prepositions often follow them ? 
  what is `` europe 's '' history ? 
  who are her people ? 
  what do they prioritize as a result of `` european '' cultural heritage and political formation ? 
  the eu needs to figure out how it can get along with itself before it decides it can have an intelligence agency , and should probably just stick to making europol work . 
  * i read the article in english , so excuse me : *  `` after attacks in new york , madrid , london , paris , istanbul and brussels now call european leaders always the same : '' we need to work better together , from now on we will begin the systematic sharing of information . '', 
  in practice , there is little of it that kind of statement . 
  the european security services are apparently not willing to share information on their own initiative together . '', 
  well , why ? 
   `` i think that now is not the jump will be made to a joint european intelligence service .
