  those nations all have modern militaries , some of them have militaries which ** greatly ** outstrip the capabilities of several european/nato countries . 
  hopefully , also , the nations of the west can resolve to conduct operations of their own , far beyond what they do now . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpos9sjjjp8 basically , in my opinion , western and allied muslim ground forces should surround places like raqqa and dabiq , set up refugee processing centers , drop leaflets telling the civilian population to leave and get out and bring cash and their families ... ... and then turn isis strongholds into craters . 
  ** i want to be clear ** i do n't want to see innocents killed . 
  but as a german , surely you are acquainted with what was done to germany ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_casualties_in_world_war_ii#demographic_estimates_of_military_losses so ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_activity_of_isil if there are 50 thousand members of isis , i think western + moderate muslim citizens + allied muslim nations should end up killing/maiming/wounding somewhere around 25 thousand people . 
  if there truly are 258,000 members if isis , i think the world 's militaries who want to be on the side of defeating isis need to be prepared to enact a slaughter of some 130,000 people who take up arms against us . 
  the world wars were not won without casualties . 
  imperial japan and nazi germany were not defeated without casualties . 
  isis will not be defeated without casualties . 
   but really a ` war ' between a modern/moderate/xxi century islam and a radical islam . 
  radical islam is winning . 
  if we do n't each ( the west with its massive suspicions about muslims , and moderate muslims with their suspicions about western institutions of power ) cooperate , radical islam will * keep * winning . 
  radical , fundamentalist muslim terrorism kills a lot of muslims , too , not just western secular people . 
  i think moderate muslims need to partner with the west , as its citizens , and as citizens of countries allied with western countries , in joining the military , intelligence services , and cultural outreach . 
  we need modern , moderate , pluralist muslim people to help us prevent radicalization , integrate people of different cultures into our culture ( while preserving their religion if they like ) , and , it has to be said - - to help us * kill * those radicalized muslims who want to do harm . 
  there 's no two ways about it . 
  if someone is a member of al-quaida , or isis , or the taliban , or boko haram , etc. 
  and they will not surrender and submit and stop committing atrocities , * they have to be killed . 
  * just the same way nazis had to be killed , but obviously the point of the allied war effort ( commanded by a guy called eisenhower ) was n't to murder * germans * . 
   wants to throw out the people who are already here with a valid claim for asylum/refugee status . 
  right , and i do n't want to undo us refugee policy when it comes to somalis or hondurans who face living in some strange foreign land * or getting hacked apart in front of their kids with a machete * . 
  civilized nations can take on ( temporarily ) acutely at risk populations that are n't huge in number while they help avert a humanitarian crisis , and permanently , some smaller number . 
  * but that 's not what is happening * instead millions and millions are saying `` lol , i 'm a refugee '' and just rushing europe 's borders and usurping its system of checks and validations . 
  * also committing crimes *  it is really only the issue of people coming here that is up for debate . 
  right , and if you ca n't control the number of people coming and verify who they are - - * you will have uncontrolled entry of unknown persons . 
  * that 's all i 'm saying , kumpel . 
   in the case of us-mexican freedom of movement , they wouldnt ( have to ) live illegal in the us . 
  yeah , we do n't want 30 million more mexican nationals fucking up our labor markets and permanently colonizing our country and balkanizing our society with a different language and pan-ethnic voting bloc , thanks . 
   the average voter wo n't care why there are less arrivals , he will only care that there are less arrivals . 
  this is like when illegal immigration apologists in the us echo what mexican officials say : `` but the * rate * of illegal immigration has gone to zero !, 
  and some recent illegal immigrants are going back !, 
  so everything is fine ! '', 
  overlooking decades of illegal entry and overstay and the * at least * 11 million illegals here already , like everything should just be hunky dory now . 
   [ from a purely national standpoint , everything is fine now and we could move on ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c-zczm5qpec/maxresdefault.jpg ), 
  we have a totally porous border with mexico . 
  the * low * estimate , ten years ago , from our census is that we have 11 million illegal immigrants , half from mexico . 
  that is to say , around 4.5 million out of 112 million people in 2006 . 
  a * low * estimate says that 4 % of the mexican population is just in the us illegally . 
  it 's definitely higher . 
  we have no border with mexico , no meaningful one . 
   can you please explain how its a good thing having people you fundamentally disagree with passing laws ? 
  totally honest question btw . 
  because ** maybe ** you are n't always 100 % right . 
  say , how do you say ` hubris ' in greek ? 
  did you forget that word or something ? 
   they 'd with canada but not with mexico . 
  oh , we essentially do with mexico and not with canada at the moment . 
  have for the last 30 years . 
   there are much more people who speak french in the world but they are in africa . 
  for now !, 
   and at least it 's a real language ( unlike python ) . 
  what makes you say that ? 
  not challenging you , just curious . 
  sexual revolution came into fruition , same as mostly everywhere else in the west . 
  people make a big deal about the pill , but it * really * also ignores the * work revolution * . 
  it 's not just that people 's conception of sex and marriage changed , it 's * also * that their conceptions of * work * and marriage changed . 
  suppose italy 's government says they wo n't honor international law without international cooperation ? 
  will the eu go to war with italy ? 
  pass economic sanctions on italy ? 
  i mean , yeah . 
  bi and multilateral cooperation on policy issues generally does involve a `` we '' and a deliberate ` signing ' of an action to ensure that all actors are in fact choosing a common action , instead of ` unilateral ' action by one member . 
  [ putin butthurt intensifies ] wonder if its a prelude to ukrainian nato overtures . 
  even if they do n't have crimea , they still offer a friendly shore to operate out of . 
  ^ the best part about this solution , is that all the polities too soft and weak to go to war against isis decisively to stop this crisis because '' waaaaah defense spending is costly !, 
  and muh social welfare !! '', 
  are * also * far too soft to actually do anything to oppose any nation with the balls to say `` fuck it , we 're looking out for \\ # 1 '', 
  okay , but still , * 4 % * of any population being * pedophiles * ? 
  that 's a shit ton of pedophiles . 
  call me a cynic , i think they 're just going to kill her and say she died during a hunger strike . 
  okay , and suppose they just refuse and go into germany ? 
  it can ( sort of ) if you 're also only having sex around her ovulation period . 
  it 's just also * waaaaaaay * riskier . 
   well aware that gender has no effect on economics i concur that your joke is funny , and misogyny is bad and unwarranted . 
  but i think it 's pretty patently true that the revolution in sexual and work roles among women that 's lead to higher workforce and education attainment and participation along with vastly reduced fertility rates and a near doubling of the labor pool has resulted in really big wage , national tax revenue , and demographic trends that all impact the economy in significant ways . 
   but the judge rejected his mitigation and said the offences could not be put down to cultural differences , adding that they were simply sexually motivated . 
  so will a course really do anything ? 
  if they * were * merely cultural differences , even cultural differences about sex ( and not what i suspect : a mix of social , economic , religious and racial resentments that a significant part of the world 's young men have towards the west , in collision with the young women of the west ) , then probably a course that seeks to explain to someone `` oh , well , you see , that 's not how it 's done here at all '' could result in someone who 's core person was good and accommodating , but * out of the loop * being ameliorated . 
  this sentence seems like it does n't interact with the cause of the problem , or do much to prevent it . 
  how you respond to criticism as an individual depends on emotional maturity . 
  you ca n't ` logic ' your way into acceptance of difficult things . 
  why do you think wages stagnated over 40 years ? 
  ( maybe has something to do with increases in the labor supply , in automation , and with outsourcing ), 
  imagine an unhappy marriage where one person spends too much and ca n't work , the other person works too much and is subsidizing them both , both want children , but one ten years ago , the other ten years from now . 
  one wants to adopt , the other wants biological children they 'll raise . 
  one makes appeals to the personal history they share ( even if tumultuous ) the other points to the future and says the past was awful . 
  one is a tremendous nag , the other a do nothing . 
  one wants to bully the other into getting what they want , one wants to guilt the other into getting what they want . 
  neither looks out for the other 's interest , they each look out for their own . 
  this is the marriage of the european union , acted out among 28 different nations with different oppositional roles on nearly every issue . 
  a divorce might be in order . 
  you either have a country , or you do n't . 
  it 's much easier to preserve your own society and your own territory and your own culture than to scrape out a patch of earth where you can live as you want to live from square one . 
  it 's also * not impossible * to assimilate people into your culture , but you have to be strict about it if they do n't want to be like you , but * do * want to be in ` your ' land . 
  you have to be more specific . 
  earning median income ? 
  above median income ? 
  married ? 
  children ? 
  both ?
