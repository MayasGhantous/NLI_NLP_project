  that means a great delay in childbirth , delay in marriage , etc. 
  sure , economically and educationally better off people marry in higher numbers and generally do n't have kids out of wedlock ... but the proportion of the population which does this as a norm is dropping ( it 's becoming a marker of wealth and letters to have a marriage first , then children - - - our black american community is currently plagued by upwards of 2/3s of births happening outside of marriage ) latino immigrants here represent a population where women are having children earlier , and religious and ethnic pressures mean families get started . 
  `` economics '' from oikonomika literally is household management . 
  fridges , minivans , lawnmowers , gardening tools , etc. 
  * durable goods * mcdonalds , capri-suns , meat , frozen vegetables , diapers , baby toys , school bags , pencils , teen driver 's insurance , etc. 
  do you see ? 
  without a stable/growing population base ** there is no economy ** ** without humans to consume , there is no economy ** the left 's gambits on abortion , on delaying marriage and motherhood and promoting non-sexed roles of economy and society for both genders , undeniably linked to redistributive roles for the state expanding and being formalized , have led to a demographic decline . 
  is it done intentionally ? 
  of course not . 
  is it something conservatives said would happen over and over again ? 
  sure . 
  is it something that merits certain conservative positions on gay marriage ? 
  absofuckinglutely not . 
  but the german left have been saying the same things as the american left . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/immigration-debate-germany-needs-more-foreigners-a-714534.html illegal , migrant , refugee , bracero , guest worker program , etc. 
  ** all of this is terminological obfuscation of the real issue ; it 's word-cover up : ** ** you need people to have a nation with a robust economy ** ** big groups of the same people look out for and provide for and benefit each other ** this has never stopped being true . 
  and as it turns out , your own tribe growing is a much , much better way to do this than hoping another tribe assimilates into yours . 
  also , assimilation requires you be dominant over them . 
  but the left does n't want to have these conversations , because they point to the failures of their management of the societal messaging , their failures of economic management , their failures of the international trade agreements that destroyed job markets , their failures of polity . 
  so instead `` bawk bawk , you 're a racist if you do n't want the country doing everything it can for foreigners while neglecting natives ! '', 
  america is lucky : we have membership in the american family decided by ideological membership .

  it does n't matter . 
  we make them into americans , they become part of our national saga , and they do awesome things for us . 
  but we 've always had controls . 
  we 've never just given up on enforcing the law , we 've never just given up on assimilation : [ ** we always assimilated them ** ] ( http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/haventohome/images/hh0077s.jpg ) we always made them into us , even as we recognized the economic potential . 
  and this is now being thrown out , here and in germany , by the left 's desire to shore up the production numbers , shore up the birth rate , get some more cheap labor , because they see the writing on the wall just as do the business owners . 
  you ca n't not have people . 
  they 're just too pussy to admit what they 've done and encourage natalist/nativist policy . 
  america can be a people of many different creeds and nations rolled into one . 
  we can alloy . 
  what kind of estonian identity will persist unless the majority of that tiny nation is ethnically and linguistically estonian ? 
  what kind of swedish identity will persist , unless the majority of that nation is ethnically and linguistically swedish ? 
  look at it in belgium , even among people who are so * close * otherwise : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/09/belgium-flanders-wallonia-french-dutch look at it in ireland : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles so , so much history of anglo vs. celtic strife led to the car bombs and the shootings , preceded by many more deaths over the decades . 
  look at it in the balkans : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_wars `` serbo-croatian '' i mean , my god , these people * still * have cause to think of themselves as separate and kill for it . 
  they 're not just making these things up !, 
  they have ** notions of nation-state and people and country that are undeniable ** that are a part of their identity . 
  so , europe , be cautious . 
  america , be cautious . 
  the left sectors in each might not understand it , but there are irredentist tendencies baked into * everyone 's identity * . 
   if you import enough so called `` refugees '' you will get pretty stable electoral base for many years ahead .

   i do n't think the public at large would resort to violence . 
  ahhh , this coming from a child of deutschland . 
  the public at large does n't need to ; you know this . 
  insane * only * if you consider all human ideologies to be different flavors of the same values ( born from the west 's enlightenment and protestant ethics and catholic church enabled renaissance , etc. 
  despite the irreligious nature of the west today ) which ought lead to secular , pluralist , kumbayah singing people who do n't want to step on toes - - this is the mental affliction of the west today . 
  all people are basically the same and there 's a trajectory we all go on and ( 1989 , a man with the first name francis through the last name of fukuyama ) :  `` what we may be witnessing is not just the end of the cold war , or the passing of a particular period of post-war history , but the end of history as such : that is , the end point of mankind 's ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government . '', 
  which is absolutely nonsensical to anyone who has had the benefit of being alive in the true post-cold war age . 
  we 've been lied to by the political class for decades for the sake of keeping the common people anesthetized about nation and state for the sake of control . 
  now the ouroboros is hungry , and the top men ( and merkels ) do n't know what to do about the refugees and the non-integration , though they were so sure about toppling all those dictators with airstrikes and inviting all those guest-workers . 
  should 've never cancelled the hk g41 , or moved so drastically away from roller-lock .

  bruh, 
   i think its implied multiple times that the entire rebellion actually benefits the thalmor , the thalmor dossiers make it clear that it is a persistent state of war which benefits the thalmor , as it weakens the ( human ) empire 's position as well as the ( human ) nord-rebel position . 
  unknowingly to most of them , they are creating precisely the conditions of alduin 's prophesy ( as happened in the other games ; brass tower , red tower , etc ) - - potentially a few who are entirely occult in leadership and not interested in a mer nation-state are outright trying to bring about the destruction of nirn/mundus . 
  the entirety of skyrim 's lore is a re-hashing of so many indo-european mythologies and tropes . 
  if you know a little ( actual ) norse or indic or greek mythos , everything from chim to the reincarnation to the mead-halls becomes really obvious . 
  it 's * good source * writing with really confused execution - - - c.f.

  i wonder , if they can hire someone for such a cushy job who is so egregiously unqualified , what about someone who 's only very poorly suited ?

    the united states would , if this were true , benefit from importing one billion combined from the very poorest rungs of africa , india and china , regardless of any consideration , but their ability to provide some level of work and incidental consumer tax income , without any cause for legal status or assimilation . 
   funny what turns out to be sensible if we ignore our preconceptions and look objectively at the data , innit ? 
   i actually think that the immense ( but temporary ) stress placed on the us would result in a decrease in the quality of life of the typical american in such a situation , but in the long term , yes , having more immigrants would help the economy this alone is all any thinking adult needs to see to understand the sheer folly of illegal immigration apologia . 
  oh look : ** you did n't post sources distinguishing the difference between legal and illegal immigrants - - averaging in the silicon valley coder fluent in haskell with illegals who can not even speak english is fundamentally dishonest in a discussion about the consequences of illegal immigration ** ** crime ** http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/national-gang-threat-assessment-2009-pdf   18th street  formed in los angeles , 18th street is a group of loosely associated sets or cliques , each led by an influential member . 
  membership is estimated at 30,000 to 50,000 . 
  in california approximately 80 percent of the gang 's members are illegal aliens from mexico and central america . 
  the gang is active in 44 cities in 20 states . 
  its main source of income is street-level distribution of cocaine and marijuana and , to a lesser extent , heroin and methamphetamine . 
  gang members also commit assault , auto theft , carjacking , drive-by shootings , extortion , homicide , identification fraud , and robbery https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/national-gang-report-2013   the southwest border  gangs , especially national-level hispanic gangs , such as ms-13 , the eme , sure\u00f1os , and tb , continue to pose a significant threat to the southwest border region.xii gangs in the region exploit opportunities along the nearly 2,000 miles of contiguous us-mexico territory to engage in a multitude of crimes , including drug-related crimes , weapons trafficking , alien smuggling , human trafficking , prostitution , extortion , robbery , auto theft , assault , homicide , racketeering , and money laundering . 
  of these offenses , drug-related crimes -- such as production , smuggling , trafficking , and distribution -- are the most widely reported criminal acts committed by gangs of all types . 
  * alien smuggling is the second most prevalent crime that gangs commit in the region , based on cbp reporting .

'' but , officials said , many illegal immigrants have received benefits because the medicare agency did not update its rules or policies to carry out the restrictions imposed by congress . 
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/03/09/tax-refunds-to-illegals-under-obama-immigration-action-would-be-stopped-by-bill/  irs says that illegals can file and claim refunds for the last three years under the earned income tax credit . 
  http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/mexican-immigrants-united-states  as of 2013 , approximately 11.6 million mexican immigrants resided in the united states -- up from 2.2 million in 1980 http://www.pewhispanic.org/2013/05/01/a-demographic-portrait-of-mexican-origin-hispanics-in-the-united-states/  today , 11.4 million mexican immigrants live in the u.s. , making them the single largest country of origin group by far among the nation 's 40 million immigrants . 
  the next largest foreign-born population , from greater china at 2 million ,2 is less than one-fifth the size of the mexican-born population in the u.s.  in addition , mexican migration has shaped the nation 's unauthorized immigrant population . 
  more than half ( 55 % ) of the 11.1 million immigrants who are in the country illegally are from mexico . 
   among mexican immigrants , half ( 51 % ) are in the u.s. illegally http://www.cis.org/articles/2004/back504.html  by increasing the supply of labor between 1980 and 2000 , immigration reduced the average annual earnings of native-born men by an estimated $ 1,700 or roughly 4 percent . 
   among natives without a high school education , who roughly correspond to the poorest tenth of the workforce , the estimated impact was even larger , reducing their wages by 7.4 percent . 
  the audacity of hope , barack obama  the number of immigrants added to the labor force every year is of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century ... if this huge influx of mostly low-skill workers provides some benefits to the economy as a whole -- especially by keeping our workforce young , in contrast to an increasingly geriatric europe and japan -- it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue-collar americans and put strains on an already overburdened safety net . 
  ** the fundamental premise of illegal immigration apologia is that more and more people lead to prosperity for a nation no matter what - - no matter their lack of education , cultural misfit , and the competition for jobs they can bring ** this is insanity : the united states would , if this were true , benefit from importing one billion combined from the very poorest rungs of africa , india and china , regardless of * any * consideration , but their ability to provide some level of work and incidental consumer tax income , without any cause for legal status or assimilation . 
   how come skin colour is the biggest factor determining whether someone is foreign or not ? 
  it 's not , but it 's undeniably a long term persistent visual reminder of foreign origin . 
  i would n't see a road forward for assimilation if 50 + million more people who look like me immigrated to the us , for instance . 
  furthermore , the racial stuff is actually secondary . 
  the linguistic and ethnic and cultural non-fit of a different racial group is what 's far worse . 
  the racial makeup of the british isles is pretty much a complete muddle .
