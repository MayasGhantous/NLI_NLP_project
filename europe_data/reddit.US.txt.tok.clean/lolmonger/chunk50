  renters ? 
  homeowners ? 
  equity in property ? 
  otherwise the question is just `` who between 25 and 35 in the eu are ` doing okay ' according to undefined markers of success ? '', 
  i think it 's an absolutely crucial question , particularly for men in considering their earning power and women in considering their fertility rate vs earning power for ages * 15-30 * , because this is what will govern the social and economic future of the west imho, 
  so you 're against elective abortion , also ? 
  one of the crazy things about third wave feminism , aided , i think by rape hysteria , is that they 've totally conserved all the old attitudes and ideas about sex being something men do to women , and that men have much more agency and responsibility than women do . 
  could n't the father also simply file his abortion without telling her during the legal time frame as a legal prophylactic ? 
  university is a different thing altogether - i 've never seen blatant sexism . 
  i 'm talking about what kind of encouragement kids get when they 're younger - it 's not always the same between girls and boys and sometimes the expectations are ones of soft implied barriers that get reinforced by everyone from parents to peers to educators . 
  just like how someone can be encouraged to go down a path , they can be discouraged , and sometimes the encouragement and discouragement is on lines of what 's ` best ' or ` appropriate ' to each gender, 
  there 's some merit to the argument that men and women are socialized to make different choices , though . 
  i firmly believe women should be refused entry into combat roles for the purpose of accelerating and increasing standards of training , without wasting per troop time and money to identify those women who are extraordinary among their gender . 
  i 'm not an equality bleater . 
  but they way some of my friends in the sciences talk and have always talked about women , it 's pretty obvious to me that if you 're a girl , from elementary school onwards you get the message that stem is a tree house where no girls are allowed . 
  that has to factor into into time prioritization . 
  i notice he also reacted to my suggestion he have his kid grow up learning slovenian with `` wtf ? '', 
  he says he wants ` european ' identity , but he does n't really . 
  i saw a great photoshop one time , of hitler at the yalta conference . 
  basically the same moral worth . 
  it 's easy enough to imagine a different timeline that saw a much less initially genocidal nazi germany becoming the big bad racist empire to fight after the second world war sees the defeat of the communists overruning europe . 
   but compared to the french , italians , ** belgians ** , germans , romans , assyrians , aztec , ottoman , mongol we were slightly more relaxed and ** `` hands off '' ** in colonial policy . 
  a little less , on that count , actually . 
  but invoking the * mongols * and * romans * when we 're talking about what 's expected from civilized peoples in the 20th century as a bar over which the british empire passed does n't inspire the greatest confidence . 
  then again , apart from peacekeeping obligations i do n't see why everyone has to keep giving the british shit about what their former governments did . 
  `` new greece '' and `` other bulgaria '', 
  and out of your own political sector , right ? 
  reddit hates her now . 
  once it 's trump vs hillary , mrs. clinton will be a paragon of virtue . 
   and we could even combine foods , like waffels and stroop . 
  guys , do it, 
  they tithe . 
   but my complaints w.r.t. 
  the refugee crisis is that we 're not doing enough to help these people will they become dutch ? 
  ( or german , or spanish , etc. ), 
  * ought * they become dutch ? 
  and what does it mean for them to become so , eventually ? 
   my son is being raised trilingually actually ( dutch , german and english ) , because i live in germany and speak english to my girlfriend and is your hope that he conceives of himself only as ` european ' ? 
  which legal citizenship do you want him to have ? 
  and why do n't you raise him with a slovene identity ? 
  with that language ? 
  or how about turkish ? 
  i think , actually , you love your son more than anything else in the world , and you want him to receive from you all the advantages and sense of self that you can give him , and that precludes being rootless , being without the language his own father speaks , and being raised in a totally different paradigm of values and identity . 
  ** this ** is what i 'm driving at , not that the netherlands should be a superpower , and this is why i think eu federation is something that should be avoided - - i do n't believe it will productively solve existential crises , but instead bring degeneracy and confusion to the national priorities of different people . 
   the problems facing this continent are continent-sized problems : the refugee crisis , for example we have one too - we have dozens of millions of people here illegally and * permanently * here because they were born to people illegally . 
  it 's been going on for decades and decades with dc 's political interests of new welfare voters and cheap labor on the left and right largely turning a blind eye ( or supporting it via amnesties ) . 
  if a particular state like arizona attempts to protect itself , the federal government stops them because immigration is federal law - even if it means they 're saying that mere months before the chief executive of the federal government passes a unilateral amnesty without the legislature for an additional 5 million illegal aliens . 
  * that * is what you invite when it comes to federation . 
  so , again : ** is this what you want ? 
  ** i bet if arizona was told `` build whatever borders you want , deport whomever you want , and make whatever calculation you like about labor costs vs territorial integrity '' while also still being required to allow free travel for us passport holders/qualifying state id holders + visa holders that would verify someone is an american or legally present , they 'd do it . 
  * but i 'd bet * they 'd also much rather keep our 50 state schengen , because there was a federal government to protect external borders . 
  bet hungary and the others would n't care * nearly * so much to build walls preventing or redirecting migrant flow if the eu could actually police its external borders . 
   do you really think putin would have shot down an american airliner and gotten away with it ( flight mh17 in case you forgot ) ? 
  do you really think he would be in any position to tell the entire netherlands to suck his dick if you spent more on defense ? 
  if the netherlands position within the eu were n't beholden to the energy interests of the eu which will pat eastern europe on the head and then turn around and ask putin about nord stream ii ? 
  you get to make your own decisions when you have the power to execute them , and the will to enforce them against another 's deciding for you . 
  perhaps the netherlands should pursue policies that make it populous with dutchmen , make those dutch prosperous , and invest in a political and defense apparatus that means it gets to be far more decisive about its own interests in now . 
  if you ever have children , are you going to teach them russian or german ? 
  maybe it 'd make more sense for them to only speak english and be more international , you know ? 
  right ? 
  or are they going to speak dutch because you are dutch and so are they and that us their language and its worth keeping your own identity ? 
   taxation without representation , worthy of a revolution if you ask me . 
  if you 're not a pennsylvanian , you ca n't vote in its elections either , if you work there but have your state residency and voter registration in new jersey . 
  you 're really , really trying to superimpose the us federation of constituent states i to a presupposed federal eu of different countries entirely . 
   they should just agree on proper boundaries as to who does what , like they have done in the us -- and even there it 's not a settled issue and a permanent source of debate ( `` states ' rights '' ) . 
  our system has shown that if you create such a federation it ** will ** grow in power and become dominant over its constituents , unless you take deliberate measures to defeat that tendency . 
  also , even if our 10th amendment were stronger , federal supremacy exists for almost all facets of law in practice . 
  ** if you point towards the us as a model , then you have to stop having countries in the eu - you can no longer have truly sovereign nations . 
  ** is that what you want ? 
  do you want the netherlands and germany to be no more than arkansas and texas ? 
   build refugee camps in africa . 
  send them there . 
  provide minimal food/clothing . 
  send the `` refugees '' there . 
     send the `` refugees '' there . 
  send the `` refugees '' there . 
                      send the `` refugees '' there . 
  right , and i 'd bet you 'd have to do that by removing them and putting them there . 
  by * deportation * . 
  russian troops and russian nationals supported and armed by russian troops and foreign intelligence services had n't killed baltic nationals and annexed part of the baltic nations , and remained their during the accession period before they joined nato . 
  `` we ca n't deport them but we can ~ ~ detain them ~ ~ physically keep them in europe . '', 
  can you detain them * indefinitely ? 
  * can you choose to stop feeding , and clothing them ? 
  sure , europe can detain them ; but so long as :  we ca n't deport them is true , they 'll keep coming . 
   diversity is good as it allow you to learn a different way of thinking/seeing/ect . 
  a group of people with diversity will view , for example , a problem from many different angles does this extend to anything besides social/political problems ? 
  are different ways of thinking necessary to all societies ? 
  what about ones that successfully solve their social and political problems ? 
  * what about ones that see increasing social and political problems correlated with diversity ? 
  yes , and so believe it 's why upper class white people in the us who all go to the same universities on the coast , marry the same people , have the same skilled non-labor jobs etc are so willing to ignore illegal immigration and refuse to hear what the disenfranchised have been saying for decades ( much of america 's unskilled labor being working class whites and also blacks , whom they never talk to , go to school with , or marry ) for instance , and are blown away by trump 's popularity . 
  they ca n't understand it . 
  charles murray has an excellent piece on this in the wall street journal about ` trump 's america ' and i think there 's a massive reaction happening to it right now , with profound anti-foreign wagon circling behavior . 
   i do n't understand how europe is so toothless decades of anti-nationalism , and historical isolation from non-westernized people , along with decades of homogenization within the west . 
  when ` culture ' is understood only as the difference between an englishman saying ` cake ' and a hungarian saying something like ` torte ' only slightly differently and for different tortes than an anglophone says the word , while still * these * guys over here have ` babka ' , and ` history ' is understood only as stuff that happened between world war one and before the break up of one national union or the other and which involves static unchanging lines of the now being those of the tomorrow no matter what , and ` language ' barriers are really just opportunities to learn a little bit more about ` culture ' and ` history ' during erasmus ... ... is it any surprise the governments of europe and the pretend polity of the eu is incapable of dealing with people who do n't see the world the same way ? 
  there 's a racism that says : these uppity brown people fleeing war should be * meek * and * soft * and * grateful * and bow their heads to us beautiful tall white people giving them food and shelter , and submit to us . 
  and if they do not , they are beastly and inhuman and must be brought to heel !, 
  it 's absolutely wonderful that in the west , we 've almost gotten rid of this ( not quite entirely , though ; soldiers of ` odin ' strutting around are an example , so is golden dawn ) . 
  but there 's ** also ** a racism that says : oh , of course they see things exactly as we do - - they just have to be * guided * and * taught * how to respect women . 
  they just do n't know , the poor things . 
  they 're like animals we need to cordon and wash and take the fleas off and then once we do that they 'll * love us * , yes they will !,
