  who 's a good little migrant ? 
  yes you are !, 
  you are !, 
  the truth is much less convenient : the rest of the world , migrants , non migrants , refugees , non refugees , terrorists , peaceful people , ` moderates ' and ` fundamentalists ' and ` radicals ' , dictators and insurgents , etc. 
  ** they 're all just people . 
  ** and people do things for reasons of upbringing and culture that turn into their personal ideologies , and they share those with a society around them , more or less , and there are north of 7 billion individual ones that you ca n't just lump into a handful of categories and create axiomatic policies to accommodate them . 
  and sometimes , you have to draw lines and say `` nope , we 're not dealing with people over there , they think a different way , too differently , and this is our shit , that 's their shit . '', 
  ________________ western people are really good at recognizing the first , and i 'd say they actually overfit and often ascribe it to just basic nationalist discomfort at swarms of refugees showing up and things like the bataclan and cologne attacks . 
  the western world - - and i include myself in this , though i 'm a brown person across the pond - - is ** really terrible ** at recognizing when it 's being racist in the latter way . 
  the first kind of racism , the first kind of prejudice , involves feeling hatred and fear . 
  the latter ? 
  self righteous pity ; it 's a moral dessert , it 's a political gumdrop , the social plaudits are like so many extra pumps of syrup in one 's fashionably expensive fair-trade coffee . 
  it feels ** good ** to be enlightened in one 's patronizing , patriarchal ( or , should i say matriarchal , angela ? 
  ) , racism . 
  it feels ** validating ** to say `` aha , i * helped * '' . 
  it feels ** smart ** to take the * nuanced * approach of not investing in a defense apparatus that can respond to savagery , but rather a welfare state that can accommodate a surplus of the needy . 
  , all the while it 's patently clear that * we are jeopardizing the situation of legitimate seekers of refuge * from one of the most brutal civil conflicts and humanitarian crises the world has seen by not actually screening migrants . 
  i highly recommend [ * welcome to sarajevo * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120490/ ) super topical , amazing film, 
   eli5 how close is europe to armed revolution ? 
  1 ) armed revolution is way more uncomfortable than the problems migrant politics is bringing 2 ) almost none of them have actual guns, 
  is of simple when make practice and strongk effort, 
  because they ca n't count on ursula and angie to send any . 
  ^ stiff upper lip . 
  `` people who waited in line with the tickets they bought become angry at people cutting the line getting in for free , more at 11 '', 
  [ how do you say ` stumped ' in french ? 
   well , i suppose technically this is correct as he is an irish citizen by marriage and since india does n't recognise dual citizenship , he elected to keep the irish and give up the indian . 
  i think that this may have some sort of business/financial benefit though as his primary place of residence is mumbai , not ireland . 
  so as a single individual , he 's reached the `` irish '' identity of multinational corporations . 
  we 'd say ` hole in a net ' or ` gaps in the net ' . 
  ` mesh ' is typically used to refer to the weave of clothing ( or in further extension : societal ` fabric ' as it were ) . 
  mesh for anything like a net does n't sound quite so good , though . 
  holes are really small in mesh , the visual of something getting through does n't work out . 
   then our leaders could n't make excuses not to help , but would be obliged to `` then americans would have to go fight and die for something the eu should be doing ! '', 
  no thanks . 
  our government has asked europe to do its part in defense for a long time , and nato is n't about going and looking for reasons to drag all member states into an existing conflict . 
  the rules stipulate that ukraine ( or moldova , or georgia ) ca n't be part of nato for exactly this reason of territorial dispute . 
  denmark is n't a poor country - what percentage of gdp goes to defense ? 
  what are denmark 's troop levels ? 
  how many fighter , bomber , and support aircraft does it have ? 
  do n't be so anxious for war . 
  you know that the massive suspicion among germans ( those less inclined to believe and like merkel ) and the world in general over german media reporting and government handling of the refugees * is n't coming out of nowhere , right ? 
  * like , it 's not an accident there 's this huge erosion of trust compared to just three years ago . 
   well , intent is another thing than the actual words that were written on it . 
  fourth amendment does n't mention computers . 
  first amendment does n't mention television . 
   in a less and less rural us and deadlier weapons becoming easier to come by we fought the british street to street and house to house in the revolution . 
  it did n't just happen in cities . 
  do you know why battery park in nyc is called that ? 
  * do you know how much private cannon and private ships contributed to the continental navy ? 
  * do you understand that machine guns stopped being legal for new civilian ownership only in 1986 and * that 's * why they 're less common ? 
  do you understand there was a ban on `` assault weapons '' from 1994 to 2004 and we 're undergoing a market fulfillment of longstanding demand ? 
  do you understand that ar-15s have been sold since 1963 ? 
  military surplus long before that ? 
  that semi-auto handguns have been prolific since the late 1800s ? 
    it 's also a harder context for this amendment than on the time it was written . 
  * oh hey look * , you 're doing exactly the thing i pointed out liberals do all the time , claiming the 2nd amendment had a specific time and place purpose and intent on a different era of the country , but somehow maintain the 14th amendment was definitely supposed to allow anchor babies when it was written about the natives and slaves, 
   all persons born or naturalized in the united states , and * subject to the jurisdiction thereof * , are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside . 
  do you dispute that the historical purpose of the 14th amendment was providing citizenship to the natives and the freed slaves ? 
  also , do n't you think it 's a * little * unacceptable that millions and millions of illegal immigrants come here and have kids and delay/defeat their deportation ? 
   said illegals can have children , and if they are born on us soil they are automatically us citizens . 
  so it 's even more worth it to just hop the fence . 
  yep it 's hilarious , because the 14th amendment was written with the explicit intent ( between the 13th and 15th ) to guarantee citizenship and equal treatment for the * slaves we were emancipating * . 
  it was not at all intended to allow anchor babies . 
  and then the left will run around saying `` well , but the 2a does n't mean what it means ! '', 
  whereas the 14th ? 
  oh no , that ca n't be challenged as to what it means * at all * . 
  a perfectly fine sentiment to take , right up until he attempts to use the monetary power of facebook to coopt public internet . 
   i guess german politicians are already rehearsing their speeches here , telling us with a sonorous/placating/soothing voice , how the situation is `` improving '' because there are less refugees coming . 
  happens here in the us , where everyone from mexican government officials t the left 's public policy blatherers will say there 's no illegal immigration problem because net illegal immigration has greatly slowed - - because it 's a forgone conclusion the millions and millions of illegals here now will stay and ought stay . 
  remember when everyone used to bash the hell out of the west/the us for supporting dictators in the middle east in the name of stability and having ruthless allies ? 
   where do you see the article dismissing hirsch ? 
  the headline where people like him in saxony are presupposed to have something wrong with them ? 
  and in the condescension of the first sentence ? 
  maybe at the end where the authors present a one-sided version of events where the psuedonymous hirsch felt he was being entirely misrepresented and they shrug their shoulders and kick at the ground with :  it is difficult to understand why it is saxony where the rhetoric has grown so radical , positions so obdurate and space for exchange and compromise so limited . 
  like they 're just * so * confused as to what happened, 
  dismissing all anxieties about identity and perpetuity of a people as `` xenophobia '' or flatly trying to call them morally irredeemable ` racists ' because they have a concept of self which not every single last person fits into is simply foolish . 
  dismissive attitudes do n't solve anything . 
  either you engage with reality , or you do n't . 
   horst hirsch saw it all coming . 
  he warned that all of germany could start looking like duisburg or cologne , metropolises with a large and visible immigrant populations . 
  he warned that the country would begin losing its identity in the face of foreign influence . 
  he wondered out loud : `` do we want our country to become islamic ? '', 
  `` do we want our country to become islamic ? '', 
  1 ) there are countries 2 ) islamic is an adjective that can be applied to nouns , and further describes them 3 ) it 's an adjective which has meaning about a variety of things ; from law , to family life , to sexual culture , to political norms and expectations , to predominant ethnicity and language 4 ) `` become '' ( i must assume this was translated from some form of ` werden ' ? ), 
  means to change into , to begin to * be * . 
  5 ) this guy is asking about the wants of ` his people ' , of people who share his identity with `` we '' etc. 
  the statement is pretty flatly clear : do we , we referring to saxons , to germans , to people of his identity and group , people with whom he shares an identity ( which is not islamic , and which is in the broadest sense , his ` own ' in his country ) - - do we want to * become * islamic ? 
  is this not a question that can be asked ? 
  let aside the realities of the german age structure , the masses of migrants moving in , and the sex ratio and family reunification and differential fertility rates and the realities of demographic shift . 
  is n't it a question that could be asked at any point , of any country which is not presently islamic ? 
  `` do we want our country to become islamic ? '', 
  - as a result of policy , as a result of policy action or inaction ? 
  is n't it something worth doing ? 
  thinking about what it means for a country to be islamic ? 
  ** or is that verboten ? 
  ** why should we forbid this question ? 
  why should this topic be taboo ? 
  why should n't the differences be teased out ? 
  why should n't a people interrogate their own value structure and appraisal of the world , their ` is-ought ' reasoning ? 
  `` what 's wrong with saxony ? '',
