  really . 
  what 's wrong with the authors of this article ? 
  what 's wrong with der spiegel ? 
  ** apparently , they have no problem interrogating the morality and intellectual honesty of saxony . 
  ** why can not this be done with islam , islamic countries , and the potential future identities of the german and european polities ? 
  this is like how the rotation of the earth adds to sunsets . 
  `` they made me sit through power points about force evolution and the transition to being a mobile military as more toyota trucks were acquired '', 
   nothing stopping those countries from arresting them the moment they re-enter though except for their obvious inability to process and track the entry of massive flows of people , including literal isis members exploiting refugee channels with the intent to attack europe . 
  i suspect one object of the sanctions is to make putin paranoid about a ` color revolution ' being possible in russia , even if political support is something he can still enforce with typical shenanigans , so that he 'll himself be more amenable to western policy , rather than banking on russians electing someone else/sweeping out his allies in a massive reversal of their current voting . 
  nope http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/7079641/women-lose-90-per-cent-of-eggs-by-30.html http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/22/ar2010022203639.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_and_female_fertility#ovarian_reserve this is just biology , bud . 
   consider the atmosphere in which british businesses operate : within the european union , a bloc of 500 million people ; friendly with america https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/europe/norway [ 2013 data on us trade volume with multiple nations ] ( https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/yanofsky_top-us-trade-relationships_001.png?w=1024&amp;h=523 ) leaving the structures of the eu 's quasi federation when it comes to tangentially economic related matters like foreign policy concerns ( uniting in sanctions on russia ) , obviously economically related matters ( like work and travel freedom for all eu member state nationals ) , and pure economic matters ( tariff exposure , import duties , vendor barriers in now ` foreign ' markets ) are all things on which the united kingdom stands to lose eu treatment on should it leave the eu . 
  that 's simply not `` leaving europe '' . 
  furthermore , staying in the eu involves an apparently deep loss of political sovereignty when it comes to things like migrant policy , which has profound economic implications of its own , leave aside the basic national integrity issues it invites . 
  the average resident of the uk , very likely , does not feel committed to the european project ( whatever that means ) in the same way vested french and german banking interests do - - - it 's not like they 're in any hurry to get rid of the pound sterling and adopt the euro even on currency grounds - - - the notion of being linked in monetary/fiscal policy with brussels is a complete non-starter now more than it ever was . 
   fourth , we should not overlook britain 's cultural similarity to the rest of europe . 
  the needling of the french or germans can blind us to just how alike we are . 
  much as i love the united states , there are wide cultural differences with the u.k. -- the millions who flock to mega-churches housed in stadiums , the shopping-mall towns , the religiosity of public life , the national extroversion , the guns . 
  wait wait wait . 
  deep economic ties with the us * via the eu * are really important ( because apparently * that 's * what determines trade with the us ? 
  ) , but it 's * cultural similarities with non-angophone nations * that should * really * underscore the need to stay in the eu ? 
  oh , and it 's not like it 's slovenia or romania or italy - - no , no , the eu states the uk ought look towards are * surprise surprise * ; france and germany . 
  are bnp paribas and deutsche bank paying this guy ? 
  what the fuck do our gun laws and people going to churches have to do with whether or not the average british person should presume that the economic and political future of their nation is * best * within a framework of loss of sovereignty towards a nearly 30 country political union that ca n't even create a coherent monetary policy , foreign policy , or domestic policy on the eurozone , on russia , and on the migrant crisis ? 
   for decades i have done business with senior figures in french and german businesses . 
  * oh wait * maybe the french and german banks * are * paying him !, 
   they would regard britain leaving as a mixture of foolishness and arrogance . 
  it would be perceived as an outright rejection -- and quite baffling , considering that now britain has the most flexible and special arrangement of any eu member yes , yes , ask the english and friends to worry about what the french will think of them . 
  * that 's the ticket . 
  *  we have successfully opted out of the euro and a damn good thing , too . 
   the border-free schengen area welcome to ~ ~ the jungle ~ ~ calais , we got ~ ~ fun and games ~ ~ sexual abuse and violence !, 
   what is it that makes `` leave '' campaigners so sure we would be likely to get an even better deal outside ? 
  `` oh , i know , i 'll list integral parts of the eu supranational framework of finance and domestic policy that have become disasters , and which the uk did n't opt into , and then i 'll rhetorically ask why uk politicians might want to stay out of the eu entirely . 
  what a wonderfully convincing , not snobbish and out of touch article this will be ! '', 
   norway and switzerland accept most eu rules , yet they have no say over them -- and still pay into the eu budget . 
  and yet , they do n't seem nearly as eager to even * join * the eu as the author supposes they should . 
   that 's the deal which gives you access to the world 's largest single market . 
  if you forgo that access , you end up like canada * canada : literally hell on earth *  that 's the deal which gives you access to the world 's largest single market ... london is the financial capital of the world and its banks can only trade across the eu with access to the single financial passport o rly ? 
  deutsche b\u00f6rse and nyse - euronext had to be blocked by an eu commission in 2012 , and then lost another appeal in 2015 precisely for this reason . 
  this is n't a carrot , this is a stick . 
   we would peel away from a major economic bloc just as strength in numbers becomes more important . 
  ** strength in numbers is only a help when there are larger numbers of people who want what you want for having thrown in with others . 
  #just look up the german age structure https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4671zd/can_we_talk_about_germanys_age_structure_as_it/ most german women , forget all other considerations ' input , only start having kids * around 30 , the end of their natural fertility * . 
  most german women * do not have more than two kids * and in fact the fertility rate is well below two on average . 
  furthermore , the percentage of the population from * right now * through the next 30 years ( the average time it takes for someone who is currently a baby female to have children of her own , given the trend of delayed motherhood ) means there are actually * not that many germans who will be born * to replace all those who will be dying - all the people 30 and above now ( who constitute the vast majority of germans ) . 
  german males simply do not often have children with multiple women . 
  they do n't drive population replacement . 
  women are the only ones who can , and they do n't , and are n't poised to in the future . 
  so what do you think german demographic 's will look like in just 20 to 30 years ? 
  a baby boomer ( era of births , not the us cohort , though they 'll be dying , too ) is coming , and not only did they not have as many kids as their parents , their kids do n't have as many kids !, 
  there will be a huge filling of cemeteries , and a huge absence in the cradles when the current crop of young western people reach their 30s and 40s . 
   accept it and find the best way forward and not be stubborn and refuse to move on . 
  and if i pushed you onto the ground and took your wallet , what would the best thing to do be ? 
  wait until i was done taking cash out of your wallet to collect yourself and just trundle off wherever you were walking before ? 
  depending on your intonation , this sentence is really different/hilarious . 
   they care , but what do you do ? 
  declare war on russia ? 
  impose more sanctions ? 
  impose more sanctions , and impose them indefinitely , until russia agrees that any support or recognition of the dpr is absolutely unacceptable , and that this territory is ukrainian territory , and territory outside their leased naval base is crimea - also a part of the modern nation of ukraine . 
  then , have the conditions for talks being six months of no ceasefire violations in their side , and the withdrawal of all russian nationals and support for those who are n't part of the russian government , from the donbass and crimea . 
  but europe wo n't do that , because nord stream ii is more important than fellow european peoples lives . 
  way , way more than six people were involved , many of them simply being the authorities who refused to take action , over and over again . 
  an irreparable shame . 
  a good cost saver , but a huge problem with the us economy is how badly fit the labor to capital is even * after * pursuing higher education . 
  even if you graduate debt free , how much better off are you at 22 ( or older given retention/graduation rates ) if from 18 to 22 you could n't work full time to build up wealth , and * still * can not find a better job than was available to you then ? 
  the proportion of people for whom a degree will mean higher earning , independent of debt , * does n't do well * when the proportion of people with a degree increases , except for a narrow number of fields where degree completion + internships/more schooling is a pathway to significantly higher earning potential , than an additional 4 years of earning and saving at the start of a career life . 
  for now , this is a good idea as the us cuts back investment in public education , but i suspect not being indebted to earn an anthropology degree in germany has much more benefits to having lived in germany for four years , than having an undergrad level understanding of anthropology when it comes to getting a job . 
  my suspicion is that german is doing this to recruit young western people who will stay and have babies , because their outlook is not so strong natally . 
   it implies that they are recognized imams , that studied at a belgian facility . 
  they know who these imams are and to some extent what they stand for ; meaning , they 're vetted . 
  ^ and this should matter to the average muslim within the belgian polity , why ? 
  because they * already * accept the legitimacy of secular government and the primacy of public institutional approval over their religion ? 
  * `` sometimes they get a little accident , but that 's the way to learn , '' johan says . 
  * self reliance is a wonderful thing . 
  their party screeds against bankers , capitalism , and jews were all * right wing !, 
  * the narrative of national socialism at hotpot sunday was all about * limited government * interference in economics and finance !, 
  [ it 's okay ] ( http://www.seaforces.org/usnships/lcs/lcs-2_dat/lcs-2-uss-independence-photo-086.jpg ), 
   the walls between mexico and the usa are letting through millions of people . 
  we have literal sanctuary cities , and half the country 's chosen political party has been extending amnesty to illegals for decades . 
  we give them in-state tuition and drivers licenses and eitc tax credits . 
  obama invites them to the state of the union . 
  the issue is n't just the incomplete walls between the us and mexican border . 
  this was done by mot juliet ( which operated alongside oda 2046 of the us special forces ) as early as 2007 . 
  the marines have units that do this , too . 
  but let 's be absolutely clear :  in afghanistan , one of our big challenges was that we would enter houses and not be able to speak to the women '' capt. 
  ole vidar krogsaeter , an officer with the norwegian special operations forces , told foreign affairs . 
  `` in urban warfare , you have to be able to interact with women as well the idea that men can not interact with the women in these countries like they do men , is because we lose political support from these nations whose governments we try to prop up unless we accept the islamic notion that the wives and daughters of men whose homes our soldiers want to search are their sexual and familial property , and that another man who is not their husband or son or brother entering the home , or taking them outside the home to do anything like question them about the movement of people or storage of munitions , is a violation of that ownership . 
  that 's literally what it comes down to , not just `` oh , but having women do a pat down search is more acceptable to these women '' . 
  that 's true , but that 's not the half of it . 
  well , good for germany then . 
  they can do whatever they feel is best in their own polity , and the austrian government can do what it thinks is best for austrians . 
  not enough russian aggression , though . 
  okay , and have uk economic fundamentals changed ? 
  and are the british people so weak that a pound which trades lower in forex will never be a boon for manufacturing and export ? 
  this feels really misleading . 
  this network with differences in lengths between nodes ( i do n't contest the clusterings ) , implies some kind of substantial , quantitative ` distance ' . 
  is that true ? 
  what 's a lexical distance of less than 25 ? 
  25 what ? 
  percent ? 
  percent of * what * ?
