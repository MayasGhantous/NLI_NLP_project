  what if i 'm a native english speaker , and i study spanish intensively for two years in college - - - does my lexical understanding of french improve ? 
  i would say that it does . 
  does it improve * less * than if i had studied italian ? 
  there 's no really good way to measure this , like say , if we had made a networked graph representation of different biological clades ( where we ** could ** quantitatively look at things like genetically conserved or novel sequences that distinguished them ) english * deer * and german * tier * are lexically related in the sense of being words for ` animals ' but they * do n't * map the same way because for historical reasons the semantic content of english `` deer '' now means deer , and `` tier '' is just an animal ( the hypernym in english ) . 
  french * cerf * ( deer ) is related to english * horn * ( via latin * cervus * for deer again ) and welsh * ceirw * - - but though they 're cognate , how do we estimate the lexical distance between all of them and languages that have * tier * and * deer * ? 
  finnish is n't even indo-european ; they have * peura * for deer/reindeer ( and i believe also the meat of those animals - - not * venison * ) so what are the lexical distances between ( each other and the others ) english , french , german , welsh , latin , finnish ... and sanskrit ? 
  and persian ? 
  and greek ? 
  wherein ` head ' is * srngam * and * sarah * and * koryphe * ( head/top/peak ) respectively , and related to their sister language latin 's * cervus * for deer , which influenced the way people talk about horns/head/deer in a number of daughter languages ? 
  okay , so now do this for the mismatched mappings of all the languages . 
  what was the standard in saying french is lexically closer to english than spanish ? 
  and why is icelandic closer than * german * ? 
  ______________________ i 'm not nearly good enough with russian to read * k. tyshchenko ( 1999 ) , metatheory of linguistics * , which is where this chart comes from , but i suspect it 's not something that 's broadly accepted . 
   england , scotland and wales are real countries , though not nation states right , that 's why i said in reference to it and others : `` scotland , wales , and northern ireland , which are n't really countries in the sense of being true nation-states of a people '' and in the real sense that `` country '' is used by almost all speakers of english , country refers to a sovereign nation-state when talking about political entities . 
  that 's why hong kong and puerto rico are n't `` countries '' . 
  i suppose you can call scotland and wales and england `` countries '' , but the sovereign state is `` the * united kingdom * of etc. '', 
  pennsylvania does n't get a say about unsc or nato membership , either , nor does texas . 
  england , scotland , and wales * are * analogous to american states , and the governmental system of the uk to which they belong is * not * analogous to the us system - so there is n't a check on the massive power that the people who are ethnically ( though just * barely * distinct ) english ( and particularly those who live near and in london ) exert over people who are cornish ( in theory ) or welsh ( with a ` country ' ) or scottish ( with a ` country ' ) or * northern irish * ( without a ` country ' ) irish people in the republic of ireland , have a true country . 
  that 's the kind of distinction i 'm pointing out . 
  and that 's decidedly why , in answer to the question :        in the same breath why should the english get to dictate whether the scots get to stay or leave the eu ? 
  the response was what i wrote . 
  because the scots do n't have their own country , and the english ( london ) domination of the united kingdom means that the sovereign state of the uk overrules whatever scots might want , in favor of what the english ( londoners ) want . 
  ____________________________ i 'm an ethnically indian person and an american national . 
  there 's a reason british people from the uk do n't get to determine stuff about the laws my cousins live under , or the laws i live under , a reason why english people do n't control us , even though both sets of us speak english as our first languages and have an abiding set of anglo cultural norms . 
  america and india became independent from ( varying ) governments of the british isles . 
  scotland stayed in the ( varying ) union . 
   in the same breath why should the english get to dictate whether the scots get to stay or leave the eu ? 
  because england and scotland are n't really countries . 
  they 're effectively states of a federation that does n't have a mechanism of balancing popular representation and state representation like england have 400 representatives to scotland 's 30 yet each having two senators in a higher house with a separate executive that requires assent from both . 
  it 's like if california ( or even just la ) and montana were simply allotted representatives based on population , oh , and the president gets elected by that council , and the rulemaking applies to all of them . 
  that 's the situation between england ( london ) and scotland . 
  ** scotland is n't independent . 
  ** that 's why ` independence ' is sometimes floated ; independence from the united kingdom , in which england has a massive say over scotland , wales , and northern ireland , which ** are n't really countries in the sense of being true nation-states of a people ** the uk is , and england ( london ) has massive , massive power in it compared to scotland . 
  so really , it 's the uk ( england ( london ) ) that dictates that the scots stay in the eu . 
  the irish ( those not from * northern * ireland ) ** do ** have a real country of their own , and that 's why if london wants them to do something , that 's uh , that 's just kind of something london has to communicate to dublin . 
  it 's been that way since approx . 
  1916 it has n't been that way for scots since about the early * 1700s *, 
  he said `` yeah , i guess so . '', 
  he was being non-committal , and not rocking the boat . 
  he was hardly like hillary clinton , voting to authorize force . 
  i believe trump 's opposition to the iraq war ** far ** more than i do obama ` evolving ' on gay marriage just in time for 2012 , when in 2009 he was against gay marriage ( or hillary clinton 's journey in gay-convenience for that matter ) * that 's * an example of saying whatever you need to say to get elected . 
  barron trump is fluent in slovenian . 
  rolling stone should go manufacturer some more fake rape stories . 
  bulgaria is where the good aks come from, 
  hey , uk . 
  sleeping giant is * ours * . 
  you guys get ` wrath of the awakened saxon ' . 
   did fucking go out of style ? 
  nope , it 's just people doing the right thing and delaying having kids until they secure a steady income . 
  but then what happens when the delay of having kids means successively fewer kids each generation to do the work that means the demands for labor that provides income ? 
  you can have automated production . 
  what about automated demand ? 
   2 people dying ... i would n't call that a tragedy . 
  yes it is . 
  those are two people who were n't at all like the people our government was trying to kill , and they did n't deserve it at all . 
   what we 've done to iraq is a tragedy . 
  a larger one , definitely . 
  an increasing scale only worsens the loss of life . 
  it does n't diminish how terrible it is for a person to die needlessly . 
  no it 's not . 
  this is an awful tragedy , and the us has a terrible track record of collateral in these kinds of situations ( and ought be entirely forthcoming with serbia about what happened and admit it fucked up massively ) , and jihadists will be no less likely to kidnap westerners to extract money or create propaganda for this incident - -- but this is n't going to lead to something like ww1 . 
  because the pilots blare seryoga on flights, 
   ... we must remember that it is culture , not war , that cements our [ european ] identity . 
  the french , the italians , the germans , the spanish and the english have spent centuries killing each other . 
  what does he think they were killing each other over ? 
  why were they ` others ' who could kill ` each other ' ? 
  why was it ever an affront that `` those people '' `` from over there '' were taking `` our land '' if there were n't ideas about ` us ' and ` them ' ? 
   today , we 've been at peace for 70 years and no one realises how amazing that is any more . 
  * but why ? 
  * this kind of peace is * not * the norm . 
  this * is * an amazing thing , and should n't seem like a natural thing !, 
  whence the peace ? 
   indeed , the very idea of a war between spain and france , or italy and germany , provokes hilarity . 
  * yeah , but why ? 
  * i 'd wager it 's because when almost any spaniard capable of going to war against any frenchman capable of going to war thinks about a frenchman or a spaniard , they think about a different set of football jerseys , a language that 's frustratingly close to theirs but not the one they studied in highschool ( or maybe one they 're fluent in , so hooray ! ), 
  or an erasmus girlfriend or a favorite food , etc. 
  they do n't think about different ideas about labor division , property ownership , religion ( if at all ) , marriage ( dohoho ) , ethnic rule , wealth-loss or wealth-gain based on how hostile/strong the other guy is , etc. 
  they do n't think about different ideas the ` other ' people might have about family , about whose land a stretch of fertile farmland is , about who has the right to sail in certain waters . 
  they do n't think about those things because their cultures about all material causes and effects about how society is done , have become * so * close as to almost be the same . 
  their interests are the same . 
  their policies are almost the same . 
  compared to the differences between the average resident of tarraco in what is now spain during the second punic war , and a massalian celt in what is now france . 
  closer , or further , than the average spanish citizen and french citizen living in either region today ? 
   the united states needed a civil war to unite properly . 
  and why did we have a civil war ? 
  because there were n't completely different cultures about labor and the role of government ? 
  because there were n't entirely different economic modes that required state enforced agricultural slavery or the stability of federalized rule and financed industrial production ? 
  ____________________ [ ** the eu ** ] ( http://hawkview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/put-the-cart-before-the-horse.gif ) why adopt the euro before adopting common rules on budgets and monetary policy ? 
  why adopt schengen before adopting federal external borders ? 
  why say ` wir schaffen das ' , when it 's not even clear who is included under ` wir ' ? 
  over and over and over again , the basic truths about what union is meant to be have been ignored by the eu 's leaders . 
  when you marry someone ( something more and more unfashionable in the eu , despite that being the most stable way to raise babies , and a paucity of new workers and taxpayers motivating all sorts of anxieties and policies ) for instance , the deal is n't a one way service obligation . 
  there ca n't only be cooperation when interests align - - the interests have to * be * aligned . 
  and if the backgrounds of people are too dissimilar for mutual compromise to optimize the effort both put in for each other ? 
  if the interests are n't naturally aligned ? 
  if there 's distrust ? 
  perhaps a divorce is necessary ; not rushing into a marriage ( or doing something like buying a house together or having kids together ) in the first place would be a good idea . 
  culture is identity - - - but it 's shared culture that * is * shared identity , and that sets the stage for unity . 
  you ca n't use structures of unity and obligation to bring cultures and identities closer . 
  i do n't think it is .
