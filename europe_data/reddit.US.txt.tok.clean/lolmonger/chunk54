  i 'm really opposed to radical ( which is actually mainstream sunni islam in many ways ) islam as far as it is incompatible with a secular pluralist west , and i wish there would be no more saudi funded mosques built in europe all the while saudi arabia does fuckall to take in migrants . 
  * but * the idea that there should be state imposed tests of registration and content to be * legal * is a little weird for religion . 
  i 'd much rather see a series of non-religious specific redlines about what you say that brings up law enforcement attention , drawn as minimally as possible . 
  in the us , we do n't even make it a religious vs not religious thing : if you incite violence with your speech , with spiritual portent or not , the police are going to have questions for you , and you 'll be monitored for sure . 
  if you encourage imminent lawless behavior , cuffs are being put on and you 're going to jail - - - - and i 'd argue under this system we still have a way broader freedom of speech than does most of europe . 
  i know i 'm being the chauvinist american asshole who things the constitution got it right and yurope got it wrong , but i do n't think the 1a is totally bonkers and has nothing useful to say about this sort of thing . 
   a town in the former east german state of thuringia wants to leave the socialist-ruled state and become part of wealthy bavaria . 
  but the reasons are economic , not political , says the deputy mayor . 
  `` we want to leave somewhere with a shitty economy and go somewhere with a nice economy , but policies about economy have * nothing to do with this * . '', 
  i wonder how this guy feels about the other migrants ... 
  i think the f-35 's real legacy wo n't just be the replacement of so many different airframes in a modernization of the us 's air capabilities , like how we view the other steps forward : i think so many allies all getting the same craft , the same almost modular base to build on , with so much interoperability , will be the real thing - like the f16 but now everyone is on the same block . 
  i really hope european defense spending takes off in the next decade or so ( for a variety of reasons ) and things like this just reinforce the idea that we 're moving towards alliance/friendly nation standardization of capabilities . 
  my point is , if you think the us ca n't have nationalism because ours is n't tied to a land hosting the same ethnicity , you better start having way more than the replacement rate of children , and fast , because unless you plan on those migrants having kids that assimilate ethnically ... ... your nationalism will count for nothing in a few generations . 
  i 'm an atheist , and if you read my comment to be advocacy that sex education come from `` average '' parents contradicting biological sciences and teaching everything out of the bible full stop , then i do n't know what to tell you . 
   we are not the ones having a second cold war with russia indeed , european nations are the ones which have rather hot conflicts with russia . 
  or are ukraine and georgia not european ? 
  basically just like russia attacking chechnya or something , right ? 
   well at least until trump that is . 
  trump is a nationalist , but i do n't think he 's invoking ethnic based nationalism . 
  also , no , he 's not a * fascist * , either . 
  he 's a nationalist , and he 's not saying anything different about us nationalism/patriotism : it 's still ideologically based , not ethnically based , for us . 
  that he points out uncontrolled migration/entry of foreign people can subvert our security and identity does n't compromise that message . 
   there 's no substance to it , nothing for it to stand on . 
  our nationalism is ideological . 
  yours is based in ethnic heritage . 
  so i wonder . 
  what language is the whole world learning ? 
  whose culture in movies and music do they consume ? 
  and how many children are * you * going to have ? 
  * how many will the migrants ? 
  when they 're being rebuilt as permanent homes . 
  i support mass deportation of illegal entrants to a country whose true risk as refugees can not be assessed by documentation - i 'm no softy - but the migrants are n't being moved into super trendy modern homes with these containers . 
  no , what the government is recognizing here is that human reproduction and human relationships are a core part of life , a central part of human cultures , part of the cycle of life ( the one leading to life instead of death ) and just the same as the state does n't presume to have complete authority over religious instruction because religion deals with the human experience and so the state does n't get to pick and choose which ones people follow/whether they must follow them , etc. 
  it ** also ** wo n't presume that all of the interpretations it makes around the basic biology of sex which are values about human relationships ... are ones which the state has primacy in transmitting to children instead of the children 's own parents . 
  that is simply not controversial . 
  supposing the government then said `` oh and part of biology will be end of life discussions and we 're to have compulsory education whose curriculum specifically is tailored specifically to the healthy disposal of a body '' now imagine the state 's expert developed standards said cremation was more cost effective and land use oriented than burial . 
  and now it 's compulsory for the children ( age 10 ! ), 
  to learn in school that cremation is superior to burial for the disposal of the body - and there 's only a body , no soul or anything , and no reason for people to have any ritual connection that preserves the body , etc. 
  okay , so you see where this goes right ? 
  it 's wrong to force everyone to adopt religious norms as a kid through the power of state compulsion , and it 's wrong for the state to subvert parent 's religious norms through the power of state compulsion . 
  our first amendment to what government could and could not do over in this country came up on this specific problem . 
  ( yes , i know this is the uk - american law did n't come out of a vacuum ) takes a village to raise a child , but what about when the child 's parents have different views on the draft into the military to serve/support combat troops to defend the village ? 
  and those views are based around core ` ultimate concerns '' about what it means to be a good person ? 
  does the state get to control morality , too ? 
  so then we have to talk about balancing the right of the individual and compelling government interests and how to burden those interests in a narrow way that is least burdensome to achieve the interests and whether they 're so important as to be compelling . 
  ** et cetera ** _______________ look i 'm not saying you 're dumb or stupid or anything , but there 's reasoning beyond `` grandparents are afraid of sex !, 
  that 's the only reason !!, 
  ! 11 '' which we might apply in looking at why cameron said ` no , the state 's transmission of information on sex education ca n't be completely and totally compulsory ' as a matter of legal enforcement , and why that sentiment had support and what laws mean when it runs up against peoples idea of the role of government . 
  but you do have : [ the most understated military recruiting ad ever ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npbo0m-7slm ), 
  former yugoslavia/neighboring balkan countries . 
  they 're all new , they all have different political places within the prior imperial ( s ) , soviet , non-aligned , and separatists ' governments control of their landmasses with shifting borders , and sometimes shifting ethnic occupation of those landmasses , they 're language intelligible but religiously split , their genetic/linguistic/orthographic / religious self and out-group identifications are all over the fucking place , and it seems like even a 16 year old in one group will know * their side 's * version of every injustice which had befallen them because of the others . 
  their region 's history makes the rest of europe 's look super simple . 
  and it 's not like the germans where the confusing stuff is separate from the still relevant stuff . 
  vastly different in our millennial and younger populations . 
  they lead the way in hugboxes , wanting safe spaces and government provisions . 
  some 40 % surveyed think we should reduce freedom of speech laws . 
  they 're way more collectivist than they are individual . 
  i 'd say it would change when they start paying taxes themselves , but ... 
   congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . 
  we do n't have a perfect freedom of speech , but compared to yurop , we definitely have freedom of speech . 
   [ by less and less germans . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0p2ycuc.jpg?fb ) joking aside - - is n't it possible the migrants will assimilate ? 
  unless they die out in a generation , wo n't they have to have had children ? 
  and their children had children ? 
  those children wo n't * all * be born to migrant women , surely ; they 'll grow up having at least one natively german speaking german parent . 
  wo n't that influence their identity greatly ? 
  the real problem with the free ridership is n't the capability . 
  ultimately , the us will perpetually have an interest in seeing the culturally friendly/valued people of europe stay alive , prosperous , open for trade and tourism . 
  no way the us security apparatus ever abandons the european theater of operations the real problem is the fundamental resentment it builds politically . 
  the part of the us voting populace which factors in security issues into their decision making looks very critically at europe , and their conclusion is not a kind one . 
  on peacekeeping outside europe , almost every nato country voted yes for a libya mission ( with royal dutch shell , british petroleum , and sa total clearly influencing a war for oil in a way iraq never was ) , followed by half of the alliance ... simply not participating !, 
  not because they were n't willing ; the capability * just was n't there . 
  * totally impotent - no way to logistically get together a ** tiny ** naval-air operation against * northern africa * , right on the doorstep , against a technologically obsolete force so close that * boat-people * can make it by the thousands with good weather . 
  eu nato members straight up ran [ low on munitions ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/af3o7eld_story.html ) , or lacked [ aircraft capabilities ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/05/nato-lacking-strike-aircraft-libya ) to keep up the same operational tempo the us had established in the early days of the no-fly zone . 
  the us is actually running into supply issues with munitions now against isis , having been on the warpath for the last 20 years , but we * also * have the industrial and martial capability to step up production . 
  is that true for everyone else ? 
  this is crazy for nato . 
  it 's not like they were fighting against russia to maintain territorial integrity in a doomsday situation - the conventional forces scenario that nato is * intended for * . 
  these are militants with a 7th century ideology , and 20th century equipment . 
  we have laser guided bombs attached to supersonic radar-invisible aircraft which align their flight path via signals on a relay network * orbiting the fucking planet * . 
  and we ca n't decisively win ? 
  it 's too expensive for us - in all our respective nato budgets - to spend the money to win ? 
  romania , poland , estonia , etc ; they do n't look to the powerful economies and technological abilities of their german ( or other large european ) neighbors . 
  they look to * america * , a world away when the russians threaten them ? 
  ** we 're not europeans . 
  ** we 're not part of the eu . 
  why should eu nations ** principally ** be relying on the us for defense ? 
  nato is a collective defensive pact which is meant to keep the european peace ; why should the * us * be the nation principally looked to when it comes to european security ? 
  so when news breaks that the nsa spies on european leaders and industry , or that we ask for newer entrants like poland to host detention facilities , the us public basically says : `` so fucking what ? '', 
  when our congress pushes trade bills that seek to make your nations ' leaders capitulate to our interests , the us public basically thinks `` good , it 's not like they manage their own transnational finances and trade well anyway '' and frankly , if in the next 20-30 years there is a confrontation with china , can the us rely on europe to do anything ? 
  to be able to do anything ? 
  that we constantly have to subsidize european security makes us * callous * to espionage against it , * unfeeling * to economic bullying against it , and deprioritizes cooperation in favor of unilateral approaches . 
  when we constantly look out for eu interests via nato we get the feeling those interests are n't just aligned with us ones - * we feel like we should make them us interests . 
  * it 's a sustainable relationship , it 's a functional one , but i do n't think it 's the best one possible . 
  vote for higher defense budgets and kick us out where it 's not vital . 
  it 'd be the best possible thing for our military alliance . 
  https://www.defensie.nl/english/topics/iraq/contents/dutch-military-contribution from somewhere in jordan . 
  jordanians and the usaf also pilot f-16s out from there . 
  here , probably : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muwaffaq_salti_air_base edit : yep - the dutch have flown reconaissance flights out of there with the belgians before : http://aviationweek.com/blog/belgian-and-rnlaf-f-16s-go-dutch-supporting-iraqi-forces makes more sense with a map : http://defense-update.com/20160101_airpower_vs_daesh.html, 
  not to be super stereotypical , but i 've looked into this .
