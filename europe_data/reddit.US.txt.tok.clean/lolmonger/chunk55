  essentially , there 's a ** very ** narrow possibility that someone could , as a private citizen in the united states , complying with registration requirements on destructive devices from the batfe and rocketry regulation of the faa , build and fire from their property , over their property , and have detonate on their property , something like a real actual * missile * , which exists solely for the purpose of being a weapon . 
  it 's governed by state , local , faa laws in title 14 of the cfr , and 27 for batfe 's governance of title 1/nfa weaponry , airspace flight ceiling laws for unmanned vehicles ( also depends on the propulsion unit ) , and your proximity to stuff like population centers and airports . 
  but , in a very narrow , hugely form filled way , you could , in theory build a substantially powerful missile - which was both a regulated weapon and propelled rocket vehicle - - and own it as a civilian . 
  * also * nothing about it can be for the purpose of allowing the weapon to engage with an aircraft , by imagery recognition and piloting , or by heat sensor , or whatever . 
  once you do that , for * any * kind of rocket/missile , it becomes illegal under title 18 laws about terrorism . 
  so , sadly , for a variety of reasons , intercontinental and anti-aircraft missiles are out . 
  * for now ... *, 
   you have a solution that does n't involve military intervention into syria or fully supporting assad to crush all rebellion ? 
  my solution for isis is one that would never be adopted by any western government , but i know that the constant inaction and internal blame game of the eu is n't how they 're productively resolve their * border * issue , which is one that should be solved regardless of what 's done with isis . 
  depending on whom i 'm talking to , i call this country anything from `` new hellas '' to `` other bulgaria '' . 
  ** maybe it does n't matter who said what . 
  ** maybe european leaders should take two seconds to shut the fuck up , breathe , and start thinking about how to end the influx of refugees into europe , how to address the circumstances of those who are here , and how to address the circumstances in specific countries outside the eu which are causing migrant flow/how to distinguish them from migrant flows which are n't justified under humanitarian concerns . 
  jesus fucking christ , what is it with these people ? 
  please do !, 
   i do n't think something like that could happen in the eu . 
  i mean they wanted a new state and not their own country or anything . 
  right , but the other commenter , replying to a notion of a viable political structure that include diverse peoples and languages , said could n't the eu be viable in the same way like india ? 
   do n't you see an india-like situation as a viable solution ? 
  they have states with a lot of differences but still act as one . 
  telegana is literally the result of ethnic bloc politics saying `` within this unified framework , which is a country , we want a new state on these grounds of ethnic unity with border we propose '' if india is supposed to be a * model for the eu * , then the constituents are * countries * . 
  unless something like telegana is something that can happen at the country level within a federalized eu , pointing out india 's federalism accomodating diverse peoples is n't a great idea . 
  got ta come to america for that . 
  six months of waiting , one ( long ) form , 200 dollars , and you can own a rocket launcher . 
  then another 200 dollar tax on the rocket . 
  ( most people go with grenade launchers for this reason ), 
   do n't you see an india-like situation as a viable solution ? 
  unless something like a telegana situation is also viable to the rulers of the eu , i doubt it will be . 
   the media need to get better at using the terms `` refugee '' `` migrant '' and `` asylum seeker '' correctly . 
  they do n't even bother distinguishing between illegal immigrant / `` undocumented '' immigrant and just ` immigrants ' in us news media . 
   brisket with belgian fries and french sauce sounds great though . 
  bring your beer and swipe an fnc on the way over . 
  a texan yet . 
  the nationality of the driver and origin of the goods is n't what 's checked ? 
  just the registration nationality of the truck ? 
  time to set up cargo truck rental in belarus ... 
  this is the least forceful material retaliation . 
  this is like ... banning another nation 's private companies ' cargo trucks when that other nation has invaded your country and annexed part of it and funded a stay behind separatist group in a huge region . 
   negotiated passenger carriage is neither public transport nor taxi service thank heavens at least one politician somewhere can see what 's up . 
  in the us we have bloated public sector transportation losing its mind as people realize uber provides far better service than almost any taxis company ( and hilariously/sadly ) buses and trains on occasion depending on someone 's price point and frequency of ride . 
  mass usage in a city does n't make it public , nor does a ride for hire necessarily make it a taxi . 
  there 's no real category for this kind of ( well , i think livery service ) thing in the us so uber goes around winking and nudging about being a technology company only ( as though there might ever be anything else they do with app development ) and nyc medallion holders go around saying they rape children . 
  so refreshing to see competent , sober lawmaking . 
  at least now there can be some framework to discriminate between things that are materially different , when the law might have to be different . 
  you can become a texan , too , but that depends on your residency in texas , your love of brisket and how many guns you own . 
   no one was really dying for danzig in particular even if you have to die for danzig in particular , that 's what being an ally is about . 
  i 've never met someone from estonia . 
  but there are at least nine estonian families that lost a son or a husband or a brother in afghanistan , in a nato mission , and almost one hundred others wounded , in a nato mission , because the us asked for their help after we invaded afghanistan in retribution for the 9/11 attacks and the taliban government sheltering al-quaida . 
  it would be a moral atrocity if estonia ( for instance ) itself were under attack , and us soldiers were not sent to help . 
  an alliance is not just saying `` when our interests are the same , we will fight with you '' . 
  it is to say `` your interests are mine , and mine yours , and if your interests are threatened , * i * am threatened as well . '', 
  what a vulgar thing it would be , to leave one 's allies alone . 
  no one is going to invade portugal ( i 'm ... i 'm pretty sure ) in the foreseeable future . 
  is it really true that there will never be russian overtures that turn into hostilities against latvia ? 
  against romania ? 
  what happens if there is no resolve to honor that commitment if putin , or worse than putin , attacks ? 
  if the desire to appease and not rock the economic boat leads to inaction among ones allies ? 
  i do n't want to see any kind of war with russia , and i wish their people would just give up the paranoia and join with the rest of the west in the economic bounty of trade and non-corrupt governance . 
  and i think there 's a lot russian culture ( so often written off as cynicism or xenophobia ) the west would do well to learn from . 
  peace would be better for everyone . 
  of all the things i hope we get out of immigration reform , immigration visas for much of eastern europe 's so very well educated people is at the top of that list . 
  fun fact , that 's how it always is . 
   in general `` financial privacy '' is just a bad idea . 
  yes , the state should know exactly where and when all citizens are because it can look at payment records . 
  it and corporations should always know what products and property people acquire . 
  what do you have that you did n't acquire at a physical time and place ? 
  that you did n't acquire because you did or did n't want certain things ? 
  which does n't mean you 're going to acquire or not avoid something else in the future ? 
  your identity ( in a biographical sense ) , and your * identity * in a personal sense , are defined by these things . 
  strip those things away from someone , and you 're left with a hairless ape that has a unique genetic code . 
  all those things can point directly to us , who we are , and what we think . 
  `` financial privacy '' * is * privacy , for the reason that money is used to acquire ` goods ' and ` services ' , i.e. 
  `` stuff humans make and use '' and `` stuff humans do and have done '' to say there should n't be financial privacy is only to say that the bank should be part of the surveillance apparatus , and the receipt a dossier . 
   i am just sick of american leaders trying to manipulate the country . 
  i do n't like it either . 
  * the only way * this sort of thing , this globalist , trans-national , post-nationalist bullshit stops , is if * your * country - - whether you believe that to be england , or the united kingdom of great britain and norther ireland , has leaders who are assertive and principally act for the benefit of englishmen or britons , and if italians , and germans , etc. 
  have leaders whose principle desire to act is in the stead of italians , and germans , so that * any * sort of `` european union '' is naturally one which will only act to benefit the common interests of all those who are european . 
  there can not be union but a union of * equals * . 
  else , it is merely domination of the weak by the strong and the imposition of obligations on the collective by the individuals who seize it . 
  yeah , and my cousin owes me like 12 bucks . 
  it 's not the same . 
  not like ukraine 's got . 
  i mean , we admitted * turkey and greece * at the same time , and that 's probably kept the peace between them over the cyprus issue . 
  but ukraine has literal russian troops occupying it , and a funded separatist movement . 
  and then the us sits back as kurds it would piss off turkey to fund get funded and ukrainians it would piss off the russians to fund get funded . 
   it 's never been different in living memory and people do n't perceive any advantage in changing it . 
  it 's kinda similar to the `` weapons culture '' of the us ... the country is no longer the hostile wilderness riddled with beasts of prey and potentially hostile natives which made weapons ownership mandatory in the early days of colonization that is n't why we created the second amendment . 
  and being nazis is n't the purpose of a competent german military . 
  look , nato is a modern , post-cold war organization at this point , just fucking vote for politicians who will spend actual money on german defense so that if the estonians get fucked we 're not the only people helping them out . 
  okay ? 
  no one thinks you 're nazis anymore , real people have been killed in ukraine by putin , and we 're all nato allies , so let 's be citizens that give a fuck and vote for credible defense policy . 
  oh , i totally agree . 
  and i wish eu nations in nato would step it up so there 'd be more leverage against them . 
  turkey in terms of sheer troop numbers provides as massive component of total nato forces . 
  it 's governance leaves a lot go be desired . 
   there is no such thing as nato obligations in terms of spending , there is only an informal recommendation . 
  yes , there 's no legal obligation , just a suggestion of what the bare minimum to do is in an alliance that * does * see nations pledge the lives of their soldiers to one snothers defense . 
  most nato nations do n't spend enough to meet ** that ** obligation , because they spend pennies on defense . 
   some of those `` far removed '' countries still have a greater military capability overall than poland by 2020 ? 
  if they keep not spending money ? 
  i doubt it .
