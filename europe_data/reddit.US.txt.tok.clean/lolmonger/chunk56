  i wish nato would commit a little more to its allies who are fucking meeting expectations of funding and modernization without them having to step it up on nato/nato related adventures . 
  there are nato members with far more robust economies/locations far more removed from russia than poland who are doing absolute * dick * about their nato obligations - - and it 's not like they 're doing shit about isis . 
  we really strive for heterogeneous perspective , sources , and no shitheads . 
  knew better than to ever submit something like this . 
  i got an a in * socialist theory * my freshman year by writing exactly what i knew would get me an a. 
  the eu is worth doing right . 
  it 's just not being done right at all . 
  it 's like how a lot of younger people have run from the institution of marriage because they can only see it as the loss of independence and the invitation of negatives like divorce ( with property/custody loss ) and not necessary to have kids ( technically true ! ), 
  and how cohabitation does a lot what they want . 
  but if they take cohabitation to the next level and really commit in a relationship for a lifetime and raise kids together ... ... they 're basically doing what the institution of marriage was * supposed * to be , and yet depriving themselves of certain legal niceties . 
  it 'd be better to rework the eu , rather than abandon the european project and circuitously attempt to have a united europe in a longer/less prosperous run . 
  go sub to neutralpolitics , brah tell your friends !, 
  also my work might send me to a site in amsterdam , but that kind of sort of depends on our funding then . 
   it 's when people are trying to portray it as an absolute practical ( not principle or hypothetical ) necessity for the functioning of society that my eyebrows start to raise one guy who has opinions he shouts from his porch on a public street corner does n't a revolution make . 
  but millions of people who transmit and reassert ideas among themselves and build a movement ? 
  that 's what the 1a protects , and so it protects the crazy dude , too . 
  one yokel with his ruger mini-14 and crushed beercans staking out his property with `` tresspassers will be shot !, 
  survivors will be shot again ! '', 
  signs ? 
  ... yeah he 's ... he 's * not * the body politic also possessing instruments of warfare en masse , but the 2a protects him as well . 
  the people are composed of individuals , so the rights are individual ones . 
   when people start claiming that an armed populace would be a deterrent to an enemy that , by this point , managed to overcome the entire us military apparatus well , i mean , i do n't even entertain that situation really , and i think it 's silly myself . 
   but to pretend it still holds the same amount of practical necessity and viability today as it did in the late 18th century , welllll ... domestically , i think it does . 
   i wonder how long we can keep this up before the mods tell us to fuck off xd if we were in neutralpolitics , i 'd have to remove this whole comment chain for being off-topic : <, 
  also most of this is just bouncing around in my head as it is . 
  reddit is sort of my diary . 
  also , spare battery + i always have my phone + i basically leave work to go home and do free lance work . 
  i think i spend about ... .6 hours not on a device each day , and that 's sleeping and eating/cooking/doing laundry . 
  : / it 's not healthy, 
   who would you regard as the more balanced and rational person ? 
  the american that has guns because he likes to hunt and shoot , or the american that has guns because he fears the government and invading chinese ? 
  that 's just the thing about our culture . 
  those are * often * the same people , including the ones that choose to go serve in the military and police . 
   i honestly kind of feel that from an intellectual pov , firearms proponents are doing themselves a bit of disservice by hammering on government tyranny and invading foreign armies . 
  it makes them look like the type of paranoid survivalists like those dumbass ranchers this is undeniably true , which is why when i try to co-opt my urban friends into driving out to pa to shoot guns , i keep everything agnostic from a political standpoint ( though i will drive home the idea that everything which is n't a roller locked firearm is an inferior solution to delaying or dissipating recoil because holy balls - why have an impulse moment out of axis with the barrel ? 
  or have a * barrel * that moves ?! ), 
   yet i think that if a foreign force is powerful , and crazy/confident enough , to take on the us military ( and friends ) and invade the us mainland ... barring nukes ? 
  let 's suppose we 're in a universe where a nuclear armed us with a standing army in the millions with the largest navy and most heavily constructed mobile artillery and armor apparatus with the most combat aircraft and spacial surveillance apparatus , composing the most powerful armed force in the history of our species on this planet and in orbit around it ... ... ... let 's suppose there 's some military alliance that goes ahead and tries to deal with that . 
  there are literally about 100 million gun owners in a country of 300 million they 'd have to occupy on top of the most powerful military on the planet . 
  also , those 100 million own enough firearms to arm the other 200 million , and our guns are n't bolt action rifles . 
  we own the good stuff . 
  so - - good luck to them !, 
  they 'd need it . 
  on a numbers basis alone , even if you dissolved the us military , a foreign force could never occupy the united states . 
  it 's just not a doable thing - - they 'd have to be willing to die by the hundreds of millions and have billions on their side . 
  ** that 's all pie in the sky stuff , though ** in the final reckoning , * just like the first amendment * , the second amendment freedom was n't written by people only trying to create the administrative procedures of a functioning society . 
  it 's meant to handle the stress cases of a polity . 
  for instance ; our first amendment - - yes , it protects zany works of art , yes it allows for goofy protest religions , yes it means college students can say what they want . 
  * but it 's also there so people can form parties of political dissent . 
  * * but it 's also there so people can be protected against accusations of treason . 
  * it 's there to * enable * treason , in fact . 
  it 's there to * enable * conspiracy , along with the fourth amendment .

  8 ) you ca n't make bail excessive , you ca n't do fucking horrible shit to them even if they are guilty 9 ) if we did n't right it down here , then you ca n't claim it 's something the people do n't have a right to , btw 10 ) if it 's not in here for the feds to do , then it 's either something the states do , or else it 's something the people retain as a power * the whole thing is just a tremendous exercise in telling government to go fuck itself * this is who we are at our core , and i love it . 
  so really , for * that * reason , i think it 's absolutely vital we have a strong 2a , just like a strong 1a . 
  also we need to identify as many potential western puppets for installation after putin is taken down \\ \\ s, 
   currently some nato nation is picked to `` guard '' our airspace , despite that fact that there is n't anything to guard not what they 're doing . 
   russian subs what they 're monitoring , just makes sense to fly sorties from iceland . 
   i think the 2nd amendment made great sense back in 1791 , when it was added i think it makes great sense today as well for the same reason a handful of nato troops in lithuania obviously ca n't stand up against the entire might of an invading russian force on their own . 
  the whole point is just to keep on par , as much as possible , one individual and another , in force of arms , so that any kind of broad decision to use violence instead of policy involves very , very heavy costs . 
  the us in vietnam , though militarily superior , was forced into a political withdrawal by people who were vastly outmatched for this reason - - we won militarily , and lost politically . 
  the second amendment is there to make the cost of using force against a populace * very * high , and to inherently require government , if it wants to spill blood , to risk fracturing its security forces against the whole of the people ( or even outright joining them ) [ `` stand your ground . 
  do n't fire unless fired upon , but if they mean to have a war , let it begin here . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_parker_ ( captain ) ) this is the ancient right of all people . 
   think being part of an informed and educated electorate is a thousandfold better guarantee against government tyranny than having a bunch of guns . 
  * oh , i totally agree * absolutely , 100 % , you 're right in the sense of immediacy . 
  i do n't just know how to manipulate an ar-15 , i also know how to file form 1s and reporting documents to the fec . 
  i consider each to be vital . 
  i make part of my living doing logistical work for political organizations on a contract basis , and i wish it were something everyone knew how to do . 
  our amendments are n't just there for weapons : they 're there for speech and privacy and political assembly . 
  as a people , we 're supposed to be fucking * dangerous * to government , at every level ; soap box , ballot box , jury box , ammo box . 
   there 's no reason for the government to curtail and fear civilian firearms . 
  at all . 
  sure there is . 
  for the same reason even obama pursued the strategy of sending weapons and ammunition to groups he wanted to overthrow governments abroad . 
  anyways , yes , we are quite far afield of anti-semitism in the netherlands at this point !, 
  ** tl ; dr ** that 's very kind of you to say , thank you - also i really do believe in the right to keep and bear arms , and my spiritual upbringing makes me love america for a bunch of reasons , including that right . 
   surely you 're not suggesting civilian guns stop terrorism ? 
  in a word , no . 
  but i would say also that any government that says terrorism is cause to take from its people their right ( codified in a constitution or not ... ) to keep firearms is * precisely * the kind of government people would do well to own firearms in . 
        you seem way too levelheaded for that nra shit . 
  so perhaps i should preface this some : i grew up a relatively orthodox hindu ( i still do n't eat meat or drink . 
  i suppose i 'm somewhere between the cultural hinduism of amartya sen , sympathies for the ancient * carvaka * doctrine , and advaita vedanta ) . 
  i inherited , and am proud of a millenias old metaphysics that embraces a primacy of the ` here and now ' and regards much else as illusory , and was even large enough accommodate an starkly atheist materialist philosophy , and which belongs to a larger dharmic , not abrahamic culture with values like * ahimsa * within the indo-european spectrum . 
  i am * proud * that i do n't eat meat , even though i do n't begrudge other people for it . 
  i am * proud * that i do n't hunt . 
  i do n't really like spiders , but i 'll go to at least some length to get them out of my presence instead of squashing them . 
  life is a sacred thing to me , insofar as i can call anything sacred . 
  _______________________ all that said , for that reason , i can not accept the idea that an individual life , whatever system it exists in , whether a true ` jungle ' of unbridled contest and uncertainty and savagery , or the refined systems of law and order that humans construct , should n't pursue defense and self determination to a maximal extent . 
  i can accept the idea of rule . 
  i can accept it because i :  hold these truths to be self-evident , that all [ men ] are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . 
  -- that to secure these rights , governments are instituted among [ men ] , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , -- that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness . 
  i can accept the idea of rule . 
  i do n't like taxes , but i do think people should look after the roads and dairy safety standards . 
  that 's all fine . 
  i can not accept the idea of uncontested rule . 
  that is abominable to me . 
  that cuts me at my very core . 
  i can accept the idea a mosquito wants to suck my blood . 
  it 's a pregnant woman , it 's trying to feed its young - that 's truly why it does what it does .
