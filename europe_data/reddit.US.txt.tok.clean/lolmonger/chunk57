  i 've let them get away with it from time to time . 
  i know the deal . 
  i can not accept the idea that i should n't wave it away , spray myself with repellent , or be barred from asserting that my body is n't its food , even by force , if i so choose . 
  so what am i to think of a government that seeks to rule me , enforced at the point of a bayonet ... and an automatic rifle behind that , a plate carrier and kevlars on the man holding it , many of them delivered to a point of protest by armored vehicles , at the command of people who may or may not respect the wishes of those whom they purport to represent ? 
  in our second amendment ( which i would maintain even the decision of * heller * does not truly acknowledge for the * beautifully radical * piece of writing it is , like the scotus has with the first amendment ) to our bill of rights ;  a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed this has been determined by courts when push comes to shove to mean the people are in fact the people who have this individual right , the people are the ones who form militias , that their arms and equipment should be * regular * ( which * heller * takes to mean `` in common use '' , a phrase with 4th circuit has recently indirectly pressed them on !, 
  ) ... because the state must not only be secure , but * free * . 
  when the british passed their intolerable acts , deployed troops to the american colonies , tried to crush dissent putting the boot down on the colonists in case they got too uppity ( removing any illusions about what it meant to be british citizens or members of the commonwealth , an illusion that existed among my parents ' people and collaborators of the british raj in india * well * after 1776 ) ... they asserted their rule principally by force . 
  they did n't just mean to march on lexington and find the patriot leaders , samuel adams and john hancock . 
  general gage was also tasked with an expeditionary force to move on concord and take the local security forces ' lead , powder , and surplus firearms . 
  and at the lexington battle green , and at the old north bridge , simple people , bringing with them their issued arms of militia duty , and their deer guns , regular people with families , related to each other , who no longer felt that the crown represented their best interests stood to say : `` you can not rule us without contest . '', 
  how am i supposed to support an assault weapons ban ? 
  when they 're effectively never used in crimes ? 
  when the phenomenon of mass shootings is far more recent than their ownership ? 
  how am i supposed to be okay with politicians who will say `` no , give up your powder , give up your shot , and obey the crown ? '', 
  it 's unacceptable to me , as a hindu , as an american , whatever ; as me - - my identity simply will not let me accept it . 
  there are plenty of reasonable firearms laws . 
  the ones this administration keeps proposing and trying to pass * are not those * . 
  ____________________________ the nra does a lot of retarded shit . 
  it has a lot of awful spokespeople ( ted nuggent 's removal is * long * overdue ) , and it employs childish rhetoric far more often than wayne la pierre 's nearly million dollar a year salary warrants . 
  * but * , they are the largest , most mainstream us firearms organization ( even if saf/alan gura are way better at scotus ) and the aclu consistently drops the ball , so i ca n't disown them . 
  from 1956 when the world saw the * savagery * that the ussr was willing to inflict on sovereign people in an undeniable `` this is no longer ww2 '' - way , up until the waning days of the soviet empire , the left * refused * to criticize the communists too harshly . 
  refused , because [ `` much of what is said about politics by people on the so-called democratic left - which includes many people here tonight - has been governed by the wish not to give comfort to ` reactionary ' forces '' ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/03/12/specials/sontag-communism.html ) when you 've spent so long screaming about rape culture on college campuses , even when it turns out both the mattress girl and the rolling stones/uva girl are full of shit , that ` listen and believe ' has been ruining men 's lives since the duke lacrosse case ... ... how do you speak out about cologne ? 
  about girls raped in pools ? 
  * that 's * a rape culture . 
  all you can do is talk about keeping one arm 's length away , because you `` do n't wish to give comfort to ` reactionaries ' '' . 
  you do n't want to sound like you side with the people you were bashing before . 
  when you rant and rave for years about `` gun nuts '' and small-dicked republicans who want to own `` assault weapons '' , and want to have the terrorist watch list used to ban firearms purchases , or * at least * want to call everyone a bigot who thinks migrant flow ( even with women and children ) should be stopped for fear of terrorists among them ... and then it turns out isis is perfectly capable of inspiring a mother with a newborn to commit the murders over a dozen people in a state with heavy gun control , and it turns out isis will literally exploit migrant channels to send a paramilitary suicide squad to kill * over a hundred * in a capital city in europe without any right to keep and bear arms - - - what can you * really * say ? 
  at best you can say well , maybe we should think about protecting our external border ( finally ) to protect * schengen * . 
  yes . 
  that 's it . 
  oh and you can still propose to take firearms from people anyway ( obama still maintains a non-due process watchlist should be used to take away guns , the eu is * still * considering tightening firearms laws eu wide , even though it 's pretty obvious czech sports shooters were n't in paris ) ________________ the left , in the us , in europe , has to fucking grow some balls and say `` we were wrong , we are sorry , we will stop denying your anxieties and we will work with you to protect what we both love - - our nations , and our political union '' until they do that , the ` reactionaries ' are going to keep gaining power . 
  i bring up us politics on this matter , not to interject `` america '' in a european discussion , but because there is , i believe now , a worldwide policy of rejection of what the economic and political masters say . 
  those whose allegiance is primarily to global stability and a mythologized promised land of a stable power vacuum where the only ruler is a neoliberal trade policy , and * not * to any particular nation . 
  i believe this reaction is agnostic . 
  you see it in the alternative left like sanders or podemos , and the alternative right like trump and fn . 
  i think it is fundamentally ` reactionary ' but no longer specifically in any political wing as goes the role of the state in collecting taxes and spending , or in debates about individual vs collective . 
  i think it is on the lines of populace vs authority , and authority has been shitting the bed for * decades * now , and the people are sick of it . 
  they 're sick of their bien-pensant media friends all saying the same shit , they 're sick of how multinational corporations can move more swiftly to pass trade bills and policies in two sets of national governments than can the people of individual nations . 
  they 're sick of how instead of investing in the literal demographic future of their own nations is apparently unfashionable , yet the politicians are so willing to dissolve the people and create another tax base , another electorate , in the image of people with a different culture . 
  not a huge development . 
  the us has nato commitments , and it might as well meet those in a cost effective way . 
  all this means is the dod expects the purpose that was once served by missions flown out of keflavik is again something it anticipates it will have to fulfill for a long enough time that with newer aircraft coming online anyway , they might as well be stationed where they 're going to be used . 
  the us and uk committing troops to poland instead of expanding bases in ~ ~ west ~ ~ germany is basically the same deal - - put 'em where you need 'em . 
  the globalists do n't really know how to handle the world they 've made . 
  two generations have grown up with the received wisdom that men and women are identical , that reproductive realities do n't matter , that there can be no negative externalities to chemical and social delay of our nature . 
  marriage is all but dead , child births if they happen at all almost entirely out of wedlock in some communities everyone has to go to school instead of work at age 18 !, 
  when they should be adults !, 
  adolescence takes longer now , it seems . 
  and with double the workforce ? 
  half the wages !, 
  and instead of self sufficient individuals , adults ' best bargain at hiding their need for a roommate to live in a big city is to cohabit with a romantic partner or get married . 
  the young can not afford to buy homes , let alone start families , the old can not afford to stop working - - who will support the adult children ? 
  there 's no money to redo education . 
  there 's no money to redo public infrastructure . 
  but there 's billions for war . 
  billions for the mass migrants from war . 
  because whether from latin america by the millions or the maghreb , from honduras or syria , at least when they flood our polity , they have children . 
  they produce many new workers ( cheaper ones too who do n't hold up the degrees we made them pay so much for in cash and tradeable debt , and demand higher salaries ) and a growing tax base . 
  the globalists do n't know what to do , except maybe try and convince themselves that mass immigration should be used to undermine national identity . 
  maybe if we keep dissolving identity , french , german , swede , pole - - maybe if we dissolve them like we dissolved the gender lines , like we dissolved the workforce and labor roles , maybe we can create a stable enough vacuum for union . 
  so goes the ambition of the davos types . 
  and then , this pope has the audacity to point out the problem , to point out the cindered apple that is the european womb , the greying future of too many pensioners and not enough grandkids to pay the pensions , even if he does n't mention outright the ugly fact that * playing womb to the migrants does n't mean you become a mother to german children * . 
   i know my wife got to see a nice fella fap on the subway . 
  i used to think it only happened on outer borough trains . 
  until the day i saw someone jerkin ' it in their sweat pants . 
  on the six train . 
  * from fucking 14th to 33rd street * at * four in the after noon on a saturday * no one said anything , no one took pictures , everyone just kind of looked away . 
   would you like to repeat this scenario ? 
  no , because i think us defense planners were deliberately provoking the ussr by installing jupiter class missiles in turkey that were obviously too slow to carry response nukes , but just fast enough to be first strike missiles . 
  the cuban missile crisis was * totally * invited by the us , because kennedy was a dumbass and : 1 ) decided it would be a good idea to back an invasion of cuba * but not really go all the way * in terms of us support 2 ) decided it would be a good idea to overtly threaten khrushchev via turkey . 
  because kennedy was an idiot . 
  he 's an absolute darling of the left here in the us , so no one brings that up , and it 's generally bad form to point out how he almost blew everyone up because he got assassinated , and so did his brother . 
  eisenhower straight up told him off over the bay of pigs . 
  so , * no * . 
  in the sense of electing another young dumb idiot to the position of commander in chief , i would not like to repeat the cuban missile crisis . 
  in the sense of making nato more robust , and honoring the sovereignty of the nation of ukraine , sure . 
  i would n't mind them joining in the future if they met standards . 
   `` women only date rich guys '' is always used as an insult why ? 
  `` men only date pretty girls '' ` is always used as an insult ' imagine if someone were trying to make that argument !, 
  so silly . 
  am i supposed to be insulted if someone looks at my dating behavior and sees that i 've consistently prioritized feminine , girlish , young women ? 
  fucking yeah i do , it 's how i am . 
  my biology tells me to do it , i genuinely as a human being , enjoy young pretty women . 
  i do n't see what it 's so controversial to point out that evolution kind of influenced women to act in a certain way regarding male resource provision . 
  it 's not at all a knock against them . 
  i think women prioritize wealth , for comfort when they 're younger , and also for security when they 're older , and i think men prioritize youth/fertility signals for fun when they 're younger , and for reproduction when they 're older . 
  i mean , we 're animals that sexually reproduce , the burdens of reproduction are not the same , and yet we as a species tend to raise kids in pair units well past our immediate sexual prime and congress - - - pretty obviously there are going to be complementary prioritizations and desires which shift over time . 
  i do n't see how this is controversial . 
   i think many men would enjoy living in a comfortable house , not having to worry about bills okay , again . 
  i 'm not saying `` indigent ''  being able to travel the world in comfort again . 
  most people who are gainfully employed * can in fact * occasionally travel for pleasure . 
   being able to eat at great restaurants okay . 
  * let me underline this * i am saying , insofar as a single man wants to have * more * wealth in order to do normal adult things for himself , by himself , * generally * that want is predicated on wanting to have that wealth * in order to do those things with a female romantic companion * and * generally * this is because women will evaluate men for companionship based on how much wealth they have to do those things beyond just doing them by themselves . 
  and * generally * even beyond just dating and hookups , when it comes to marriage ( which does start to become a priority for women as they get older because they want to raise kids in a stable household ) , women are * generally * looking for guys who will do more than just ` get by ' . 
  two guys who are single and earn enough to pay their own way all the time when they hang out and travel and eat out and whatever as * friends * , is one situation . 
  if a guy wants to have a girl as a romantic companion , * largely * he has to pick up the bill . 
  that 's just how it is , and women mate associatively based on comfort when they 're younger , and security when they 're older , in a way that * men do not * . 
  i 'm speaking in generalities , but that 's largely how it is . 
  i mean - - - in your experience , have you ever seen 20 year old men * change whether or not they think a girl is suitably attractive to them * based on whether or not she earns enough money to pay for herself on dates ? 
  okay , now how about 20 year old women evaluating 20 year old men ?
