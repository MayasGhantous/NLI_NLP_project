  they conceived of themselves as muslim * before anything else * . 
   til all the `` christian west '' is totally secular find a nation with strong christian values that enforces christian law beyond gay marriage not ( as of yet ) being overwhelmingly legal . 
  we used to have * actually * christian nations and christian laws and entire nations whose militaries were * commanded by a papacy * whose seat was the vatican . 
  * popes * used to * crown kings * who were the leaders of people , much like mullahs of islamic theocracies holding ultimate rule , or else kings holding complete executive power in upholding religious rule . 
  i mean , this was centuries ago , but it really was the order of the day , and thankfully , all of that has been done away with . 
   i also learned that we 're living in a world that nearly all muslims are looking out for a caliphate , i never claimed this . 
  i merely suggest that a lot of muslims do in fact desire the return of the caliphate , and if you believe that there is n't substantial desire to see a pan-arab or better yet , pan-islamic governance among muslims around the world , you 're terribly unacquainted with mainstream islam . 
   all sunnis are salafis and all shia are some extreme fundamentalists who are ready to follow every extreme mullah * good thing i specifically pointed out i was talking about subsets of sunnis and shiites as relevant to those muslims who are in fact in conflict with the west because their culture is primarily islamic and did n't ascribe those qualities to all muslims . 
  * ___________________ your comment is making misreading after misreading of mine . 
   two things are to be remembered : that a man whose opinions and theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some intelligence , but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete and final truth on any subject whatever . 
  when an intelligent man expresses a new view which seems to us obviously absurd , we should not attempt to prove that it is somehow true , but we should try to understand how it came to seem true . 
  i 'm not a complete moron - - i hope you 'll allow me that consideration - - so maybe just do n't dismiss me out of hand , i suppose . 
  i do n't mean to give the impression i 'm reductive about cultures and histories of people who are part of ( partially or totally ) the ummah - - i had hoped that was clear , but let me be explicit about it to disabuse you of any notions of reductive orientalism on my part . 
   how long has this western secularization been in place ? 
  i would argue it came fully into sway with the decades prior to ww1 ( and * certainly after ) and the true destruction of europe 's last `` empires '' on the continent itself in favor of populist , nationalist movements as people reorganized themselves into nation-states . 
  the simple , tricolors of so many nations , the ethnic narratives of what it meant to be `` german '' or `` italian '' or `` french '' , etc. 
  in a rejection of the pompous ornate crests of heritable rule and the stablization of current borders ( to be restored and renegotiated after ww2 of course ) was one such large movement in what i think the secularization of the west was and the final `` death '' of `` christendom '' . 
  further ahead of that though , would probably be the enlightenment and the proliferation of what i think were proto-humanist , secular views among the mainstream of continental philosophers . 
  my own nation 's constitution and founding philosophy is a syncretism of montesquieu and rousseau and kant that the intelligentsia of the time seized on in opposition to the status quo of british colonial rule . 
  i do n't think there 's any real way you can look at the declaration of independence , and the constitution ( particularly the bill of rights ' first amendment ) and not see the profound impact they had . 
  * so , not to be too chauvinist * , i would say the founding of the us and the subsequent revolutions and nationalist movements in europe were also deep blows to christendom , which * often * asserted itself through imperialist and colonialist powers because of the power of royalty . 
  not to belabor the point , but i think secularization and individualism have been trends in the west operating and having ebb and flow of power and type for a long , long time , even if there are specific moments where i think the tendency was most acute , and i think this is what greatly distinguishes the `` west '' from most other places on the planet . 
  it * certainly * distinguishes us from almost all histories of the islamic world , regardless of their particular ethnic makeups . 
   has it been achieved throughout the former `` christendom '' ? 
  no , because i believe that the soviet union and marxism was in fact completely contrary to the ideals of what i think we can call `` the west '' - - while also being arrayed against the bourgeoisie as a consequence of notions of class struggle , and the effects that it had on the psyche and political expectations of huge parts of the continent from the former warsaw pact eastward meant that they did n't share the same parallel cultural development as others . 
   how should we view malaysia and indonesia , both democracies of significantly longer standing than many countries of the former christendom ? 
  as nations which have long and deep ethnic histories with a superimposed islamic norm that 's lead to a very particular synthesized culture . 
   what about pakistan ? 
  you can still see elements of the * vedic * peoples in pakistani norms about the world , or more appropriately , expectations and habits of people who inhabit what in the late 1940s , came to be organized around the polity of pakistan , separate from its founding reasons . 
   is tunisian culture interchangeable with saudi arabian or kuwaiti culture ? 
  i 'm not denying that there is complexity , richness , and nuance to non-western peoples , * at all * . 
  i 'm not some uneducated boor whose lettering and education about the world only extends so far as the other rubes around him , i assure you . 
  _________________________ i am saying that in the scope of a person 's culture being primarily * islamic * they will be in conflict with `` the west '' . 
   easy access to guns . 
  we have a lot of guns , especially handguns . 
  nope . 
  legal access to firearms has fuckall to do with criminality . 
  look at the difference between vermont and new hampshire ( the former having literally almost no gun laws at all when it comes to handguns ) , and d.c. and chicago which have some of the strictest laws ( the former having had a literal handgun ban for decades during its worst crime waves )  wealth inequality - poor states tend to have higher murder rate . 
  so states with black population have higher murder rates . 
  ^ it 's this one , and perpetual wealth inequality and socioeconomic segregation enforced through a nexus of historically discriminatory laws in the criminal justice system , and soft , passive social discrimination in material attainment ( like housing loans and school choice ) it 's that one , every single time , when you need to explain why one area is more violent than another . 
  it 's almost never legal access to guns because : 1 ) we have high gun ownership , low crime ( and low gun crime ) states and cities in the us 2 ) we have low gun ownership , low crime ( and low gun crime ) states and cities in the us 3 ) we have high gun ownership , high crime ( and high gun crime ) states and cities in the us 4 ) we have low gun ownership , high crime ( and high gun crime ) states and cities in the us criminality has very , very little to do with local gun laws , and much to do with why someone becomes a criminal . 
  guns are n't a talisman of evil that make an other wise rational purpose someone willing to pull a trigger on another human being . 
  ____________________ if you took this map and did it county by county , you 'd see that upstate ny has basically no murders in comparison with nyc , and pa has basically no murders in comparison with philly . 
  as for pennsylvania specifically , for decades now , philly has had about 12 % of the commonwealth 's population and ** represented about 50 % of its homicides ** guess which part of pennsylvania has much more widely represented legal firearms ownership , though ? 
  `` the concept of culture clash between islam and the west is unscientific '' i mean , no it 's not , so long as anthropology is a science , and we can historically say the west has a culture that is a result of the secularization and reduction in strength of polity of what was once called `` christendom '' as it went through things like the peace of westphalia , the renaissance , the enlightenment , industrial revolution , the world wars , the sexual revolution , and predominately muslim/islamic cultures and polities are ones which largely descend from the traditions of the ummah , whether they are outright political as in irredentist notions about a caliphate , eschatological concerns about the last messenger of allah swt , sunni/wahabist/salafi-school notions of islam or shi'ite ones of post-hadith interpretations of the qu ` ran , which further than muhammad 's pbuh requirements of war , demand jihad against the kuffar 's refusal to accept islam and when the policies of dar-al-harb lead it to war against muslims . 
  if we * can not * : simply call a spade a spade , and point out that * indeed * there are in fact people who do not share our values , who do not see the world the same way we do , who do not make the individual , group , polity , and movement calculations we would expect ourselves to pursue in their position , and that we may indeed have to react differently than if we were simply in contest with a version of ourselves ( or admit that we are in contest at all !, 
  ) , then i do n't see anything ** but ** the eventual rise of a un-nuanced , starkly authoritarian , decisive , and violent ` right wing ' ( really , reactionary against what is pc and neoliberal/globalist views ) to replace the anodyne , tone deaf , and ineffectual leadership that exists now . 
  ______________ think back for a moment to what all the sage and wizened and august ` commentators ' of public life were saying about ukraine !, 
  this is a ** fantastic ** piece , and though it analyzes principally us establishment incompetence in engaging with putin and underestimating the severity of ukraine , i think this is a problem that pervades and is destroying the west 's polities from the inside out , and is highly relevant to the current migration/isis crisis . 
  http://www.the-american-interest.com/2014/03/01/putin-smashes-washingtons-cocoon/  a politico report calls it `` a crisis that no one anticipated . '' the daily beast , reporting on friday 's us intelligence assessment that `` vladimir putin 's military would not invade ukraine , '' quotes a senate aide claiming that `` no one really saw this kind of thing coming . ''  op-eds from all over the legacy press this week helped explained why . 
  through the rose tinted lenses of a media community deeply convinced that president obama and his dovish team are the masters of foreign relations , nothing poor putin did could possibly derail the stately progress of our genius president . 
   there were , we were told , lots of reasons not to worry about ukraine . 
  war is too costly for russia 's weak economy . 
  trade would suffer , the ruble would take a hit . 
  the 2008 war with georgia is a bad historical comparison , as ukraine 's territory , population and military are much larger . 
  invasion would harm russia 's international standing . 
  putin does n't want to spoil his upcoming g8 summit , or his good press from sochi . 
  putin would rather let the new government in kiev humiliate itself with incompetence than give it an enemy to rally against . 
  crimea 's tartars and other anti-russian ethnic minorities would n't stand for it . 
  headlines like `` why russia wo n't invade ukraine , '' `` no , russia will not intervene in ukraine , '' and `` 5 reasons for everyone to calm down about crimea '' were n't hard to find in our most eminent publications . 
   nobody , including us , is infallible about the future . 
  giving the public your best thoughts about where things are headed is all a poor pundit ( or government analyst ) can do . 
  * but this massive intellectual breakdown has a lot to do with a common american mindset that is especially built into our intellectual and chattering classes . 
  * ** well educated , successful and reasonably liberal minded americans find it very hard to believe that other people actually see the world in different ways . 
  ** * they can see that vladimir putin is not a stupid man and that many of his russian officials are sophisticated and seasoned observers of the world scene . 
  american experts and academics assume that smart people everywhere must want the same things and reach the same conclusions about the way the world works . 
  *  how many times did foolishly confident american experts and officials come out with some variant of the phrase `` we all share a common interest in a stable and prosperous ukraine . '' we may think that 's true , but putin does n't . 
   ** as far as we can tell , the default assumption guiding our political leadership these days is that the people on the other side of the bargaining table ( unless they are mindless tea party republicans ) are fundamentally reasonable people who see the world as we do , and are motivated by the same things that motivate us . 
  ** many people are , of course , guided by an outlook not all that dissimilar from the standard upper middle class gentry american set of progressive ideas . 
  but some are n't , and ** when worlds collide , trouble comes . 
  **  too much of the washington policy establishment looks around the world and sees only reflections of its own enlightened self . 
  _______________________________ i believe the same softness and unwillingness to look at the beast affected most eu leadership during the ukraine crisis , and still does now . 
  oh , but poland is * always * paranoid about the russians . 
  oh , but * obviously * the georgians are going to be spooked by the russians . 
  we do n't need to take lithuanians and estonians and latvians ' anxieties so seriously . 
  we can do * business * with putin !, 
  he 's the kind of guy that wants to see nord stream 2 happen , so we can obviously assume he shares some of our other political goals and values !, 
  _______________________ so too with islam and the west . 
  the wests ' leaders have apparently , in the post-ww2 , and particularly post-cold war era , forgotten what culture is . 
  it 's not just food . 
  it 's not just dress . 
  it 's not just language . 
  it 's also what you think about women in the workplace . 
  it 's also what you think about sexuality . 
  it 's also what you think about other people 's self determination and cause for disagreement . 
  it 's what you think about pluralism . 
  it 's also at what point and why you pick up a weapon , at whom you aim it , and when you open fire . 
  ** are your targets other young men with automatic rifles in a different uniform , with orders to take or hold a position which you are ordered to hold or take ? 
  or are they middle aged men and women enjoying dinner and young kids at a concert ? 
  ** culture is ** everything ** that motivates a human being to act and not act , to do and not do , to choose and not choose , outside of mere genetic cues in their deep programming that tell them finding warmth or extra shelter or clothing is a good idea when it 's cold out , and that they should eat when they 're hungry , and that darkness presents extra physical and social dangers as opposed to when it is light out . 
  culture is ** everything ** beyond that , and western leaders and a huge segment of the population who at all perpetuate this idea that culture class is `` unscientific '' are burying their head in the sand . 
  if they do n't pull their heads out of the ground , and rub their eyes and look at the problem clearly , the people of the west are going to default to people who ** do ** , even if their solutions are quite a bit less pleasant than people would otherwise hope to have . 
  `` let us know what the laws are , because we ca n't get a goddamn word out of the sovereign national governments you negotiated agreements with ! '', 
  oh , i 'm not saying they produce cerebral content or something , i 'm just saying , from the pure valuation perspective alone , they 're doing it right . 
  they decided to pivot and they 've been in a slow shift to trying to be/define what is a `` new media '' company for a while now . 
  i remember the early , * early * days of buzzfeed , and it was basically * pure * `` omg viral video !!, 
  internetz ! 111 '' , and it still is now , but with way more glitz and polish and with a ` journalism ' wing in order to have as much space on the internet as possible for ad vendors and just self-promotion . 
  it 's really smart . 
  what i think is a slightly more focused summary of the article ( leaving out stuff about captor testimony and the details of another isis member , etc. 
  ) : ______________________  a member of a british cohort within the islamic state that oversaw the brutal detention and beheading of western hostages in syria has been identified as alexanda kotey , a 32-year-old convert to islam who grew up in west london .
