  ya heard of the troubles ? 
  when large groups of people have totally different priorities and cultural politics , sitting right next to each other , disputing ownership of land , bad shit happens dude . 
   i 'd wager that a vast majority of europeans would n't think of saluting a soldier like saluting their country either . 
  ... or most lebanese . 
  i highly doubt the point of the ad was to point out a real life occurrence, 
   at the same time we can point out its flaws constructively without falling into a ` you and us ' mentality pretty sure everyone is capable of this , boyo . 
   we do n't have that mindset that `` soldiers are heroes '' or what have you . 
  that 's not really what i was pointing out : pride in one 's nation , a sense of nationality , a sense that the country and its people with whom you share that designation are * your * people , to protect and support before all others . 
  this basic sense of nationalism seems totally lacking among most of europe from an outsider 's perspective . 
  good for us , too . 
  our allies seeing farther and hearing better benefits us . 
   islam is not compatible . 
  the trick is that you do n't want muslim french people or muslim german people or muslim swedes . 
  in the us , we have * american * muslims . 
  there have got to be french muslims , german muslims , swedish muslims . 
  that is to say ; when push comes to shove , there have to be * frenchmen * , etc. 
  part of what makes me worried about europe and its ability to assimilate migrants is that some nations ( germany in particular ) do n't seem to have any kind of nationalism . 
  there does n't seem to be that same fire in the belly for one 's country . 
  i can not comprehend how readily people will say they are n't proud of their own nation because they see it as accidental they were born there . 
  i did n't choose my mother and father , either - - it would be disgraceful to think they 're simply interchangeable with other people . 
  i 'm not lebanese ; [ but how can someone deny the sentiment of this ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn_lwewawf8 ) ? 
  ( i get that the symbolism is very twee and heavy handed . 
  that 's not the point . ), 
  it 's shameful , just shameful that europeans will not stand up for their own nation 's future when their politicians so clearly do n't share those interests . 
  look at the kurds - - that 's the fate of a people who have no nation . 
  oh absolutely !, 
  millions and millions of economic migrants coming illegally from latin america for decades , when the most we had to offer for the longest time was the ability for them to make their * children * and * grandchildren * into american citizens and brutal illegal employment in us dollars to send home . 
  there will be a deluge coming to sweden , to germany , to france - - the difference between america 's southwest and mexico and guatemala is there , for sure . 
  but between syria and libya and iraq and western europe ? 
  night and day . 
  senator ted kennedy in 1965 :  `` the bill will not flood our cities with immigrants . 
  it will not upset the ethnic mix of our society . 
  it will not relax the standards of admission . 
  it will not cause american workers to lose their jobs . '', 
  ( u.s. senate , subcommittee on immigration and naturalization of the committee on the judiciary , washington , d.c. , feb. 10 , 1965 . pp . 
  and the result ? 
  mass immigration , much of it illegal from latin america decade after decade . 
  about 1/3 of the country will be hispanic in a decade , and white people will no longer be a majority in the us as soon as 2030 . 
  we already have social programs at the state and federal level that formally an informally transfer wealth from the anglo to latino population , and we had tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors show up and cross our borders as a result of previous deferred immigration action . 
  ( sent to relatives already illegally living here ) . 
  it builds tremendous resentment and distrust , mutually . 
  it 's only getting worse as language separation seems to be persisting . 
  we have 15-20 million illegal immigrants in the us and a huge percentage of our population is now foreign born . 
  american wage norms for everything but highly skilled/profession labor have fallen through the floor , and huge numbers of agricultural jobs were lost to foreign nationals ( even before nafta formalized offshoring via the border for american manufacturing ) and this is with * legal structures * and * planning * and that famous american jingoism of being the best/being xenophobic . 
  and with a federal government and unified federal policy !, 
  we 've had to have amnesty after amnesty - the arguments always the same : `` they just want to escape violance/poverty ! '', 
  `` you ca n't split up families !, 
  ( so they all have to be here ! ) '', 
  `` you 're racist if you do n't want lots of foreigners here ! '', 
  what on earth is going to happen to a totally decentralized europe and millions and millions of refugees and economic migrants i wonder ? 
  america 's native born fertility rates are bad enough : demographic decline is even worse in europe . 
  we have a great ability ( compromised further and further ) to assimilate different people into `` americans '' - does such a capacity exist to make people of vastly different ethnicities from * several * national borders away into irishmen ? 
  spaniards ? 
  swedes ? 
  we do n't have a national existence totally reliant on ethnic identification ( though certainly in part ) - how true is that for france ? 
  for belgium ? 
  multiculturalism is strained here in the us once it 's no longer just a matter of different skin tones and foods and heritage practice shared by comfortable upper middle class people with identical opinions at university or the workplace - - - - it will be tested much more severely in europe . 
  ** what responsibility does a government have to foreign people that it does not have first to its own people ? 
  ** _____________________________________ i want to be very clear here : i 'm speaking as a brown skinned and beardy , racial and religious minority in america whose parents were immigrants themselves . 
  i am not against immigration , nor do i believe that ( at least for the united states and canada ) a nation 's preservation of norms must inherently involve an exclusion of those who can not immediately blend into the predominant ethnicity . 
  the laws that my parents had to adhere to in order to come here were * very * difficult . 
  most of my extended family could not and can still not come here , except as tourists . 
  but that is because the laws , as they were meant to be followed , were for the benefit of * americans * already here . 
  my parents were allowed in only when they could prove , through a very rigorous process , that they had the material means to provide for themselves and the ability to assimilate . 
  my parent 's children - myself and my siblings retain an ancient language and peculiar religious identity and cultural/food practices that are n't normal in the us , sure . 
  but while my fathers ' people 's history begins at the battle of pratapgarh , my people 's history starts at lexington and concord . 
  my father still resents the british and their colonial legacy ( his own father having been abused by them ) . 
  i will be proud to take my sons to fort mchenry and yorktown . 
  to me , this is absolutely crucial . 
  a nation must not only ensure that its own people do not fall into poverty and that the poor population does not swell , but also that its people are cohesive in identity . 
  admitting many impoverished and foreign people is a recipe for disaster , to say nothing of what it does to the labor norms for the most economically vulnerable of a nation 's own citizens . 
   why do we actually need submarines ? 
  sub to surface vessel torpedo strikes against ship destroyers , aircraft carriers , and troop landing vessels ( and other subs , which can carry nuclear armaments or attack aircraft ) , and ballistic missile launch from anywhere in the sea . 
  basically , if a nation has access to water , and expects nations hostile to it to have access to water , something that can shoot at their ships in the water and their stuff on land from underneath the water ( even though it ca n't do much else ) is a pretty powerful thing , because it 's hard for something on the water or flying above the water to shoot at something underneath the water 's surface . 
  ( except other subs - - and that makes for intriguing planning as well , much like purchasing aircraft having defensibility issues too ) it 's one of those things where the laymen can understand it ... but you have to be one of the unfortunate bastards with financial and human life liability on your shoulders to really come to a decision . 
  elect good politicians : american congressmen make retarded hardware buys . 
  okay , but then we 're supposed to accept he 's a ` normal ' american soldier ? 
  pathological only when it 's convenient to slur , and not otherwise . 
  amazing . 
   it encouraged our companies to look for other markets than eastern and pushed us to invest in our army significally . 
  that is good . 
  poland is straight up going to be the south korea of central europe . 
  they 're not deluged by an immigrant population , only slightly below fertility replacement rate , have a steadily improving economic condition , their * own currency * and fiscal policy , a military well on track to meet the 2 % nato guideline with * actual * outlays on modernized equipment ( air and armor ) , a well educated populace , etc , and a cohesive national identity and ethnicity . 
  if i had slightly more cash on hand and the tax laws were different , i really would invest in polish industry sectors . 
  watch : over the next decade , immigration to the uk and germany from poland is going to slow up as they take on more and more refugees , and more and more sons and daughters of poland will stay there for the education and economic benefits . 
  2001 : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/26/poland and people were only just waking up to this reality . 
  they wo n't be ignorant for long : http://www.mckinsey.com/locations/warsaw/publications/poland%202025_full_report.pdf i just hope the us can attract lots of them before they stop having a reason to come . 
  well , i mean [ these guys probably could n't afford rounds for those cannons . 
  ] ( http://images.realclear.com/266637_5_.jpg ) i dunno if some minoan dude with a fancy new bronze sword could afford it all on his own , either . 
  i like the video because of how genuinely excited they all seem to have blown some shit up . 
  like they forgot what it is for a moment and just reveled in how cool it was . 
  i know lithuania and estonia did - i 'm sure part of this is to demonstrate things to baltic nation 's defense planners to win contracts as much as it is to train nato troops on modern systems . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oorah_ ( marines ) #origins they do the same . 
  i wonder how many people have been saying `` hooray '' differently . 
  even earlier . 
  the near entirety of the ulster irish and scotch immigration to new england and appalachia was driven by how fucking terrible the english were to them on top of the economic incentive . 
  george washington and john sullivan decided on the guard password of `` st. patrick '' when the british were being evacuated out of boston in march of 1776 . 
  the jacobite uprisings were n't a total failure ; they just did n't succeed until a little while later . 
  our country 's whole history and culture is beautiful to me because of how many different kinds of people built it from its earliest steps . 
  hell , we 've had chinese people here since the early 1800s , and literal fellow citizens for well over a century of chinese origin .
