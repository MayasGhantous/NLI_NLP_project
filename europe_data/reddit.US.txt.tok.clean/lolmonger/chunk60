   he grew up in the shepherd 's bush section of london and was the son of a greek cypriot woman , who worked as a printing machinist , and a man from ghana , who was from a line of dress cutters . 
  his father died when he was a toddler . 
   kotey -- known as alexe to his friends -- attended the al-manaar mosque in london , as did [ emwazi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jihadi_john ) , and friends recalled that he stood out for his radical views . 
   one former friend said kotey used `` to have this stall outside the mosque , and those guys used to openly preach and argue about what they thought was their cause or ideology . '' the friend , who would only discuss kotey on the condition of anonymity , said kotey also advocated suicide bombing , arguing with those who said it was forbidden by the koran . 
   kim everett , a neighbor , described the young kotey as `` lovely , a really quiet boy '' and an avid follower of his local soccer team , queens park rangers , who played with her sons . 
   kotey converted to islam in his early 20s after meeting a muslim woman with whom he had two children before they separated . 
   everett said she did n't see kotey much after he left home and was surprised when she happened to run into him when he was in his early 20s . 
   `` the next time i saw him he was bearded , full garments , '' she said . 
  `` i did say to [ his mother ] : ` alexe 's changed his faith ? ' and she said yes . 
  she was n't too happy . '' _____________________________,

'', 
  `` do ho ho , amerikans are dumbb !! '', 
  what is this , 2005 ? 
   merkel is the leader of the cdu party . 
  cdu stands for : christian democratic union . 
  yeah , i 'm aware of that . 
  i 'm asking , is n't that just sort of a quaint historical name for the party ? 
  like , does religion/catholicism/any kind of broad * christian * sentiment actually get reasonably invoked by german politicians ? 
  does the church have any real say ? 
  my understanding was germans of all kinds were not particularly religious . 
  there is gdp , and yearly percentage growth , there is bond rating , there is currency exchange rate - - - the greatest wealth in all the world , though , is your * own people * . 
  and for the sake of these people , you should never stop fighting . 
  i mean my god , i 'm not opposed to helping refugees , but what about your own countrymen ? 
  it is one thing to help a stranger that comes to your door - but what about your own brother ? 
  that 's true , but america 's occupation control of the german polity ( at least , the half we controlled with a literal wall and militarized zone around an isolated capital and a hostile force occupying the other half ) enforced by a near complete military and intelligence domination of it in 1945 to decidedly being a sovereign nation prior to reunification ... was following a bloody war ; the execution and imprisonment of the nearly the entire political class that was in power ; and the rewriting of the frame work of german law to suit our vision for the country . 
  at the point of a bayonet affixed to a rifle in the mid 40s , a pistol in one hand and a dollar in the other in the 50s , and paychecks by the 60s . 
  and then only a quarter century ago did the country * finally * reunite as a peaceful sovereign nation in truth . 
  from the 1930s to the 1990s - - - that 's how long unchecked problems take to resolve and be fixed in a * best * case scenario . 
  the allies * hardly * stopped controlling the german polity in 1949 , what 's more - - it had to * wane * , bit by bit , until the german nation was one which we were confident was not only de-nazified , but our ally against communism , and even then , because of the geographical location , we did n't really remove our military assets . 
  * that * kind of massive coercion , aid , occupation , and reformation of a country over * decades * - - - - who has the appetite to do it in syria ? 
  we * barely * had a system like that in iran , and we lost it , we could n't redo it in iraq , and so we have no shiite muslim government in our pocket or better yet - - as a self sufficient ally . 
  at best , we 've still got a loyal/friendly/cooperative / powerful * sunni * muslim government in the form of the saudis . 
  that 's kind of * it * . 
  the rest of the middle east outside friendly sunni dictatorships and israel and jordan/lebanon ( which are n't exactly free of terrorist infiltration ) is one giant fucking clusterfuck , better analyzed as an incompletely pacified germany in 1944 than a partner for peace called west germany in 1955 . 
  ___________ there simply can not be something like a marshall plan to rebuild the middle east as of right now - - it has to be pacified first , and there 's no will for that . 
  this one was * literally * a war for oil , not neoconservative empire building hubris like iraq . 
  also , * people * . 
  http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2014/0917/644411-birth-rates/ the irish natively grow their population ; young men and women start families , and build homes and families and drive consumer demand and their children do the same and their productive labor to provide for their families provides tax revenue along with fueling their consumption . 
  rinse repeat . 
  but once you have a bad economy * because * it 's difficult for people to make babies ? 
  because it 's difficult to progress in life ? 
  because it 's difficult for people to make a future ? 
  and then you have to import your labor and import your taxes and import your children ? 
  what a road to go down . 
  if turkey was n't part of nato , it would be like a scorpion losing a pincer , even if it kept its stinger . 
  nato 's developed economies as a general rule : 1 ) do n't spend anything close to the ~ 4.5 % of gdp the us does , or even the 2 % of gdp * vastly * smaller nations with only recent independence and economic development as sovereign polities seem to be able to manage . 
  2 ) therefore do n't have any money for either high troop levels , * or * modern and force inter-operable hardware 3 ) cynically just dump any security responsibilities off onto the us when it comes to large international nato efforts ( even ones they vote for ) because they lack capabilities , and russian-focused ones onto the eastern nations that have the most to lose ( and which serve as buffers for them ) if turkey were out of nato , total nato troop numbers would suffer tremendously , as would available modern nato hardware . 
  furthermore , their position makes them relevant both to middle easter/central asian nato obligations * and * russian-focused ones . 
  the west should stop giving turkey a free pass , but the west should probably stop passing on its * own * obligations , too . 
   reconstruction ended 7 generations ago . 
  yeah , and black people literally had separate schools until 1954 . 
  and they did n't have laws protecting them from systematic , race based denial of home mortgages until the 1970s . 
  so yeah , ** whoopdee fucking do ** - we started treating them like actual people instead of second class citizens * all of forty years ago * , on * the surface level of mortgage policy * , following four centuries of treating them literally like farm animal property . 
  * so generous *, 
   robin niblett , director of think-tank chatham house , stated in a report published last year : `` for a mid-sized country like the uk , which will never again be economically dominant either globally or regionally , and whose diplomatic and military resources are declining in relative terms , being a major player in a strong regional institution can offer a critical lever for international influence . 
  * hey , remember when some half literate yokels all got their squirrel guns together and just decided to consistently outnumber any far better trained troops you could send , and broke off from your empire , divorcing themselves of any membership in a powerful , larger commonwealth ? 
  * how 'd that go ? 
  \\ #rulebritannia a uk which ca n't be strong without eu membership might as well completely dissolve . 
   why the fuck do we house people in fucking berlin ? 
  it would be so much cheaper to house them in the surrounding muncipalities same reason germany is going to spend billions on importing workers/a tax base instead of on incentives for young germans to start families and own property . 
   bring down the walls and disband all border patrols between us and mexico and see what happens . 
  you could do that without much cause for worry if you implemented what i 'm talking about . 
   yeah , and if european border guards just shoot everyone who got near , except you do n't need to shoot anyone . 
  you simply have to stop rolling out a red carpet , leaving the door open , and bending over and spreading your legs in front of a flashing neon sign that says `` fuck her right in the pussy ''  this string of thoughts tears through multiple constitutions and thousands of laws all across europe . 
  funny , so do the millions and millions coming to europe . 
   none of what you wrote has any relation to refugees and asylum ` cept the part where i specifically pointed out : `` no welfare for people who are n't documented refugees . '', 
   look at your boarder with mexico . 
  it is one of the most heavily controlled boarders on earth and has it stopped illegal migration from mexico yet ? 
  ** that 's because border security is meaningless ** things that would kill illegal immigration to america : 1 ) no more citizenship by birth to foreign national parent ( s ) , unless the parents are legally in the country on immigrant visas/have permanent residence 2 ) no further ssn issuance to illegal immigrants , revocation of all daca privileges and other amnesty programs 3 ) no lawsuits against state or local authorities who inquire about federal immigration status or pursue illegal immigrants and refer them to ice . 
  4 ) * no federal money * to any municipality , city , state , etc. 
  that has ` sanctuary ' policies or which does n't cooperate with federal immigration authorities or which permits illegal aliens to study in their public higher ed institutions on financial assistance of any kind . 
  no federal dollars : including disaster relief and highway funds . 
  5 ) permanent individual ss-4 / ein eligibility revocation for violators of federal laws stipulating one must not hire illegal immigrants , whose business income exceeds 50,000 dollars in a fiscal year , with federal repossession of business assets and federal prison sentences for repeat violators . 
  6 ) mandatory federal minimum of 10 years in prison for trafficking illegal immigrants 7 ) mandatory federal sentencing on felony grounds for any detained illegal immigrant with a criminal record ( in country or outside ) which would be punishable for up to 10 years in prison or be a felony . 
  _________________ stop giving giving people who are n't genuinely refugees any incentive to come to the us or europe and they 'll stop . 
  stop letting people hire them , stop letting people have them as tenants , stop letting cities and states which want cheap labor and sales tax flow use them , stop letting people who come here and commit crimes get off the hook . 
  we do n't have to * do shit * to the us border . 
  europe does n't need to * do anything * to european borders . 
  all you have to do is take away the incentive to come illegally and stay illegally and impose actual consequences for bad behavior . 
  no welfare for people who are n't documented refugees . 
  * no * welfare for foreign nationals who are n't documented refugees - - and no permanent refugee stays , and no wishy washiness about deportation . 
  if every eu nation implemented this , and was willing to enforce it , they would n't have to do shit about schengen . 
  yeah , what about poland ? 
  they 're going to stay a mostly white , mostly religious , mostly socially conservative nation in perpetuity because they 've decided they like it that way , and they 're greatly investing into their military , and their economy is booming . 
  http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/economic_studies/how_poland_can_become_a_european_growth_engine https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/poland/2013-12-06/six-markets-watch-poland really , the only issue they have is an aging population , and their situation is not * nearly * as bad as some other nations in close proximity . 
  so , as it happens , pluralist , western , modern society is possible , you can retain your culture and your social norms , etc. 
  ... is russia * really * forgoing all of that because they want to stay russian ? 
  or are they just * not capable ? 
  the last thing we want is us style criminal justice . 
  but we had decades and decades of institutionalized socioeconomic segregation , leading to enclaves of generational poverty and broken homes in our urban centers where the next generation and their subsistence ( and never their improvement ) eked out on public money - - we went from entire communities being burned down by the klan and others in the post reconstruction period , to denial of housing loans and jobs during a whites-only prosperity in the during the baby boom , to decades long institutionalization afterwards . 
  and so we have literally millions and millions of people who have no generational wealth , no actual families with a real mother and father , lots of young men who do n't work , who commit a lot of crimes inviting lots of law enforcement crack downs , inviting more institutionalization and more crime , etc. 
  europe does n't want our system , but if it screws the pooch on integration and assimilation , it will get it . 
  remember that video of the migrants/not-white looking people/maybe even second generation people on the train which was posted here yesterday ? 
  remember in the comments , everyone asking `` where are the police !? 
  why are n't they doing anything ?! '', 
  that 's how it starts . 
  then the resentment builds up and people start looking differently at any brown people , and then when a cop finally shoots a migrant , there 'll be a huge swathe of the political sector backing it up , people will call for harsher laws , private institutions will realize that white europeans will pay more money to live in mostly white areas , etc. 
  then it 's in full swing , and you 'll have all the problems the us does . 
  the thing to do now is aggressively integrate and assimilate foreign peoples and reduce the influx of those beyond the capability of europe to integrate and assimilate them . 
  otherwise , you * have * to be hard on crime because you 're going to get crime .
