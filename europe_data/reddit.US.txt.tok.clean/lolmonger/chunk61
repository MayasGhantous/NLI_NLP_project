  better to just make them like you , than change yourself into someone more fit to deal with them . 
  why exclude switzerland ? 
  ought not a future eu include them ? 
  if it 's already accepted that current international order should exist in perpetuity with nation states and neutrality towards alliances , then what does that say about the eu 's feasibility ? 
  dude you guys do compounds and shit all complicated like . 
  but , yeah , unless at the level of german speakers willingly giving up their sovereignty to form supra-nations and then people culturally close to them doing the same , unless at that level there 's a clear path forward , then how will a larger union work ? 
  but if you do n't take lots of tax money away from the people who do n't have money , the current people who have money will have competition !, 
  imagine if the government did n't tax new housing developments being built for middle and lower class renters and - gasp - buyers !, 
  imagine if suddenly there was lots and lots of new housing !, 
  the market would be expanded against a government created burden and rich people who currently own scarce property could n't rent-seek as much !, 
  horror of horrors !, 
  covering up nudity during trade deal visits with iran . 
  hell , we might be getting in on the party soon , too . 
  pan-anglo alliance once we get australia and nz together as well . 
  the ultimate ruse !, 
   the eu is based on the will of people . 
  if british do n't feel european or do n't want to belong to eu they are free to leave . 
  ah , and the eu is supposed to define what it means to be european ? 
  tell me , what does it mean to be `` european '' , and are ukrainians `` european '' ? 
  how about norwegians ? 
  do you think they feel `` european '' or not ? 
  are they `` european '' to you ? 
   this is the eu is for me . 
  i want it to be something to make all this power politics and territorial disputes stuff within europe unnecessary . 
  then it should start ** much ** smaller : a gr\u00f6\u00dfe-deutschland of germany , austria , and the netherlands , belgium ( german/dutch ) , luxembourg and switzerland . 
  a truly united kingdom of great britain and ireland a czechslovakia , and perhaps a yugoslavia , too . 
  small independent nations with similar enough language and culture assimilating into the geographically closest ` closest ' match , with all parties giving up their sovereignty to be a bigger , unified , equally represented whole . 
  ** until that 's possible on the micro scale ... ** how on earth will it be possible with 28 different nations ? 
  slips only occasionally , posts in character all the time . 
  perfectly fine ? 
  why is it perfectly fine to slander any group of people as reducible to nothing but bad ? 
  you 're saying `` do n't stereotype all middle eastern or muslim people as bad people '' when the poster is categorically saying religion is bad . 
  but why ca n't he stereotype all muslims as bad then ? 
  is it because to do so would be to categorically stereotype * just * a swathe of racial groups then ? 
  but what about when mena people are christian or bahai or jewish or yazidi or atheist ? 
  is it really true that his views against religion are ` perfectly ' fine ? 
  and what happens when comparing nearly entirely secular and atheist white and western societies ( which do exist in europe ) with * religious * foreign ones ? 
  supposing he rails against religion then , and the object of his views against religion as a whole have the consequence of the balance of vitriol being squarely against just mena people in comparison ? 
  supposing instead of catholic child rapists and nutjobs , there 's a comment pointing out in isolation the realities of afghan bachibazi and islamic jurisprudence about stoning ? 
  does something that 's ` perfectly fine ' when it 's just about `` religion '' ( but in the broadest sense and clearly including white/western populations ) * then * become verboten ? 
  i 'm not trying to say you 're stupid or something - but what 's really the line on where people are allowed to disparage others and for what reason ? 
  and if it ever looks like they 're going too far , why is that ? 
  they definitely do , but in my opinion , neither the israeli nor presumptive palestinian government have acted in good faith - between terrorist attacks and unwarranted military actions , constant death rhetoric and outright landgrabbing , it seems pretty obvious both populations have elected/installed/otherwise given free reign to actors who would gladly just do away with each other through violence and will involve third parties through `` oh woe is me ! '', 
  theatrics every so often . 
  it 's hard to have any sympathy for either side at this point - the most i can say for israel is that they have a western system of government , and the economic development to have internal law and order and so we can more easily negotiate with them and expect enforcement of terms . 
  ... except of course for when they tacitly encourage extralegal landgrabs . 
  they - the jewish and muslim people who happen to both want to live there , really just have to figure out whether they 'll keep murdering each other or not for themselves . 
  i do n't think anyone can constructively intervene . 
  a million like them before even one more fake refugee or one more dollar in tribute to the middle east 's barbarian dictators !, 
  and now think about how cruel it is to them if we do n't properly screen and therefore * have the resources to actually help * . 
  this is basic trauma management - you have to prioritize * precisely * so that you can make the most difference ; the eu is going around taking pulses and asking people to only take one lollipop and some assholes with papercuts are cleaning out the pharmacy while others are bleeding out on the floor . 
   behind a dark doorway at the heart of one of britain 's biggest conurbations lies a secret subterranean `` cave '' where homeless men are sleeping with rats in conditions that would have horrified victorian social observers . 
  but not contemporary ones ? 
  this is absurd . 
  masses of homeless people living in caves happens in rural china . 
  this is basically the same thing - cities need to accept change , and stop taxing development so that the only new stock is built for the ultra-rich as investment properties and retreats , and stop assuming public transit improvements should pay for themselves . 
  otherwise the only results will be mass homelessness or a removal of all the `` excess '' to outside cities , meaning there will only be higher labor costs . 
  foolish . 
  he certainly considered himself a free market/limited government proponent . 
  he would 've hardly considered himself a ` statist ' in relation to his academic rivals . 
  as an unabashed and proud reactionary/conservative/republican / puppy-eater/etc . 
  - - that 's not just a feature of the left . 
  it is a feature of `` movement '' politics wherein ideological purity ( which , admittedly , is important to focused , broad efforts ) becomes so important that it actually becomes more important than the actual issues . 
  this kind of stuff has always existed among the left , and it 's been there in the right-wing , too . 
  murray rothbard once wrote of milton friedman ( who you might 've suspected would 've been chief among his allies in the academic climate of the 1970s , even more bizarre than leftists have gotten today in some respects ) : `` and so , as we examine milton friedman 's credentials to be the leader of free-market economics , we arrive at the chilling conclusion that it is difficult to consider him a free-market economist at all . '', 
  `` the libertarian movement has coasted far too long on the intellectually lazy path of failing to make distinctions , or failing to discriminate , of failing to make a rigorous search to distinguish truth from error in the views of those who claim to be its members or allies . 
  it is almost as if any passing joker who mumbles a few words about `` freedom '' is automatically clasped to our bosom as a member of the one , big , libertarian family . 
  as our movement grows in influence , we can no longer afford the luxury of this intellectual sloth . 
  * it is high time to identify milton friedman for what he really is . 
  it is high time to call a spade a spade , and a statist a statist . 
  * '' which , i mean , come on . 
  rothbard would have us believe milton friedman basically just indistinguishable from a fabian school reformer or a die-hard pro-government marxist . 
  purging the unbelievers is just something that happens whenever people decide they have finally stumbled on a perfectly axiomatic , irreducible and comprehensive system of deciding what is and is n't good about the world . 
   nobody really expected the situation to escalate like this . 
  oh , people expected it to escalate , they just got lumped in with the * actual * racists on stormfront over and over again . 
   do you literally believe that assimilation is prevented by genetics ? 
  no , but your genetics * generally * derive from the people who raised you , and that has huge influence over your culture . 
  this is why people with certain hair and eye colors * tend * to be people that speak certain languages and follow certain religions . 
  this is just an observation . 
  there 's nothing about genetic makeup that actually determines how a person acts or thinks or feels . 
  ** but ** , from where your genetics derive is * generally * an indication of where you were born , geographically speaking , and what culture you were born into , and * those * two things have * profound * implication for how you act , think , and feel . 
   you claimed that europeans are supporting multiculturalism because they are simply not familiar with immigration from countries with significantly different cultures yes . 
   that claim is quite obviously bullshit a small number of chosen , ordered ( and actually still not totally integrated ) foreign immigrants does n't undo my larger claim . 
  in fact , i think it points to how deeply * true * it is , given the fact that germany 's gastarbeiters were ** not ** the norm for the rest of europe which has had very insubstantial foreign immigration until recently . 
   the us will become the `` second europe '' where the old cultural values are still more or less persevered . 
  in some sense , our christian revivalist waves which * still * mean our culture is more conservative than yours has shown this to be true . 
   why would n't there be ? 
  i am not saying there is any link between genetic origin and behavior . 
  that 's all post-transcription , and happens at the level of culture , which is an imposition on a brain . 
  it 's a very high level thing . 
  what i am saying , though , is that generally the culture you 're raised in is the one your parents had ( because their reproductive authority and authorship tends to mean they 're in charge of everything else ) , which means there 's ** generally ** a link between ethnic origin and culture - - it 's even reflected in our language : `` indian '' and `` serbian '' and `` german '' as adjectives do n't just mean nationality , but also ethnicity and culture because of this linkage of where you come from , and how you 're likely to see the world , and what historically , that meant as went your genetic profile because of geographic separations which lead to narrower reproductive pools and the development of distinct cultures . 
  ** so ** with those preliminaries : yes , i feel that substantial demographic/ethnographic shifts in germany ** do ** indicate that * german * culture could be put at at risk . 
  ** maybe ** it is true that there could be circumstances in which the germany of 2162 is a nation of people who are in genetic origin entirely from north africa , the levant , and south east asia , and who speak , read and write perfect hochdeutsch , eat and drink wurst and bier and schnitzel and milch and drive around in bmws and mercedes in between their high tech schooling and factory work and their suburban cottage-style houses blasting bach and beethoven . 
  ( forgive the sass ) but * probably * , my suspicion is , that almost uniformly , mass demographic and ethnographic change in a short period of time means largely that a culture will be * replaced * , not * assimilated to * - you see ? 
   all you need is a reformed education system and some effective social engineering to compensate for parent influence and , over time , erase any meaningful differences in early childhood in majority of kids . 
  well !, 
  it appears we 're on the same page , actually !, 
  but do you think this can happen in a short period of time , with enclave communities and large numbers of foreign people ? 
  i am not so sure . 
   every child born in germany ( or one that moves to germany at a very young age ) is a blank canvas that can potentially turn into anything from a terrorist to the next german chancellor .
