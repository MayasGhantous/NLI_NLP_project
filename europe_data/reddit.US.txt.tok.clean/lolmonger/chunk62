  except for when they grow up in a particular community with particular parents . 
  as an `` indian '' person born in rural america , who prays in sanskrit , does n't eat meat , loves country music and guns - - - i have to say , i really think that you 're ignoring just how influential environment and parenting can be in determining identity . 
  i just do n't think the experiences of the ghettoes in the us and in europe should allow us to keep the illusion that integration is accidental or arbitrary . 
  yeah , i dunno if just one kind of culture is possible . 
  look at czech rep. vs poland though , on lots of these issues ( or even just divorce rate ! ), 
  except your gastarbeiters were selected for economic ability , education , and the like - - it was n't a free-for-all , and it was a process with controls . 
  there was * order * . 
  and even still , 1.5 million of those 3 million hold * foreign citizenship * to this day . 
  and it 's not like it stops there : http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/turkish-immigration-to-germany-a-sorry-history-of-self-deception-and-wasted-opportunities-a-716067.html there are obviously plenty of totally integrated turks who are not really usefully called `` turks '' anymore than someone would legitimately say `` east german '' or `` hessian '' - - they 're german born , native german speakers , identify with german culture and the german nation , and * simply happen * to have genetics that are not autochthonous to germany . 
  i 'm once such person , but over in america - - - i have no other homeland , no primary language , no sense of belonging that * is n't * tied to the united states of american , * even though * my complexion makes it quite obvious my ancestors evolved somewhere other than where the founding population of the us polity did . 
  but this situation is not by any means , the overwhelmingly case for turks in germany , particularly when you dig into what it means for a very devout muslim person to live in a society where women are presumably equals in every sense . 
  * and those are the remaining problems of the gastarbeiters . 
  * now look at the difference between them , and the * refugee waves * . 
  until someone is willing to admit there 's a link between women entering the workforce , the whole workforce being one that demands schooling and not working and owning money and having a family * during exactly those years women are most capable of having kids * , and women in the west * not having kids * as a consequence ... ... and ... ... declining birth rates - - - unless people are willing to talk about this , all of the problems of tax bases and consumer spending and the balance of population of the native culture against a foreign culture , etc. 
  until people are willing to talk about this without anyone who brings it up being slammed as sexist and evil ( and racist if they bring up foreigners ) , there will be no solution to those problems of tax base erosion and the like . 
  the end is not nigh , but the circumstances that will set in motion pretty undoable demographic realities * are * . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/germanypop.svg/langde-330px-germanypop.svg.png basically , men and women assortively mate - - similar incomes , similar educations , similar ages . 
  rare , in reality , is the 40 year old man with millions from his business and a manse marrying an 20 year old maiden who knows only how to do the laundry . 
  rarer still is the opposite . 
  furthermore : biology does n't give a fuck about post-sexual revolution work and sexual norms . 
  the realities of ovarian reserve are such that women who do n't have kids by about 30 are in a pretty shit situation to have more than one healthy baby ( if they plan to space their kids out at all ) - and in the context of many , many women not even being married by then and having had a marital relationship with a single man whom they will have settled down with and planned out kids * at 30 * , the `` by 30 '' realities are even harsher . 
  it sucks , but men and women were built differently , so the demands of career basically destroyed both single income home realities * and * delayed marriage . 
  it 's just how it is . 
  furthermore , unless people are having an average of 2 kids ( to replace the mother and father who will both die ) , the population in total will decline . 
  if there are 100 people , 50 women , and 50 men , and they turn into 50 pairs which each produce * one * kid , then after the first set of married couples die , you have ~ 25 men and ~ 25 women from those pairs singular offspring , and you 'll have 25 couples . 
  now what happens if they too , each only have like one kid ? 
  so , yes , there might be 80 million germans ... http://kff.org/global-indicator/population-under-age-15/ but those under the age of 15 , who are going to be ** the ** group of people poised in the next decade and half to have children ? 
  13 % of german society . 
  ** and it 's not just germany ** it 's pretty much every single western nation , including the us , when you look at their `` heritage '' populations . 
  the only thing staving it off in any country is * mass immigration of foreign peoples * . 
  in the us : http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/09/28/us-foreign-born-population-nears-high/72814674/ and it 's gotten so high that the us is poised to no longer be a `` white '' ( if you extend that anthropologically as we did in the us ) nation by 2040 . 
  as a non-white person , i do n't really care . 
  people who are culturally american are culturally american because we just assimilate people super duper well . 
  it 's literally what we do . 
  it 's how the country works . 
  we 've never had an `` american '' ethnicity - - the first native born american president was martin van buren and his first language was dutch . 
  but is there a national future for `` germany '' if * something like half * of its people are from turkey in genetic origin ? 
  or if more and more of its people are n't lay-catholic and protestant , but * muslim * ? 
  because it seems that muslims are n't often lay-muslims , but are dedicated and devoted muslims , who sometimes have their places of worship funded by saudi arabia and qatar . 
  and while the vast majority of muslims are peaceful , germany ( and other nations ) have * clearly * seen an influx of those who are * not * . 
  so what 's actually going to happen in the next 50 years as there 's ** complete die off ** of everyone who is 40 years and older * right now * ? 
  as the current crop of 20-30 somethings ( who will be 70 to 80 years old then ) , who ** are n't ** having kids ( and if they are , clearly are n't having two to three as the norm ) grow old ? 
  as the current crop of under 15 year olds represent only ** 13 % ** of the german population ... ... all the while the third world 's population ** explodes ** , and shows no sign of getting the economic and political stability that would prevent them from coming en masse to europe ? 
  _________________________ these are tough things to think about . 
  they 're not fun to think about . 
  they raise lots of questions about everything from sexual norms , to racial self identification , to tax allocation and life goals and gender norms and cultural comparison , etc. 
  it 's a hot turd on a sunny day , and no one wants to be the person to kick it . 
  i get that . 
  but it 's not like burying our heads in the sand will mean the problem is solved . 
   pretending they wo n't be a huge cultural clash is unrealistic . 
  my suspicion is that europeans had for so long ( 70 years about ) been a `` multicultural '' society in terms of only meeting other white westernized people with the money to travel and go to school abroad that they thought that indeed multiculturalism meant slightly different food and beer and heritage clothing , and identical modern public values of secularism and nominal plurality for what are always a powerless minority if they deviate from the racial and cultural script . 
  now they 're swamped and they do n't even know how to talk about people who are at once differently colored ( a sacred class ) and have super misogynistic views ( a horror they stamped out among themselves ), 
  my understanding was that even once matriculated into hauptschule vs realschule , there were still ways for students to perform better ( or worse ! ), 
  and be reassigned ? 
   i do think the laws in alot of europe is way too restrictive , there should atleast be exceptions for people like me who are ex-military . 
  eh , the american view is that morality does n't change , military or not . 
  we really do n't like the notion that there should be a monopoly on force given to the government - praetorians to keep the plebs down from the patrician masters . 
  but we 've always has kind of commingled security - militias , popularly elected sheriff 's for county law enforcement , open carry , etc. 
  i suppose it 's different for people whose government traditions transitioned gradually from royalty and centralized systems . 
  not sure it has a focus . 
  seems its owned by local world , owned by trinity media . 
  i think it 's just a general news site that runs wire stories on everything so it can get internet clicks from google ( how i found it ) and uses cookies to serve local content . 
  definitely not specifically for financials or something - i dunno what you call it , really . 
  is n't this exactly what the gsg9 are for and the reason they were formed ? 
  more likely is the us seeking european immigrants leading to easier immigration for poles and others , over simple visa entry alone . 
  so ; tourism still kind of shitty , long term work and residence and putting down roots - easier . 
   i was just saying that despite the divide within the country , after the civil war , for the first time ever , americans considered themselves more american than new yorkers ( for instance ) . 
  that 's not quite true . 
  there was a distinct american ( though colonial ) identity prior to the revolution that people coalesced around . 
  our parochial state identities existed insofar as there were economic interests peculiar to large vs small , high density vs rural states ( virginia , rhode island , boston-massachussets , the carolinas ) , but it was never as dramatic as `` well , there 's new yorker people with new yorker language and new yorker culture , very distinct and alien to pennsylvanian people with pennsylvanian culture and pennsylvanian language '' the republic was looser , for sure , but it 's not like there was n't a clear understanding of unity in terms of common culture , language , and political values . 
  to wit : it was in 1776 when we decided we were now - * the united states of america * and that were were all american citizens , who belonged to these united states . 
  that persisted even though in 1787 we adopted our current constitution , and abandoned the government set up by the articles of confederation . 
  and it persists today , though we 're far less like the old republic . 
  and basically no one can carry in nj or nys or california , either . 
  and yet carry is much more accessible in the czech republic . 
  so does that make it clear on why i say there are some places in europe that are much better for gun ownership than some places in the us ? 
  jesus fucking christ , this should n't be hard . 
   i definitely and without doubt feel european . 
  is that so ? 
  what is it you feel when you feel `` european '' ? 
  what is it you value ? 
  what is it you cherish as a `` european '' ? 
   it still was the factor that created a stronger national identity for americans ww1 was much more important in that regard , as were our colonialist/imperialist adventures against the spanish territories and natives . 
   well , let 's look at the usa , for instance . 
  before the civil war , us citizens identified much more with their state than they did with the federation . 
  except for that time we united in revolt against the british and formally declared ourselves americans independent of their rule and established a nation whose political framework survived the civil war and still exists to this day . 
   the collective effort that they put in that war made then an extremely united country afterwards . 
  this is true -- but in reality it has more to do with how extensively federal power was extended in that time period , which continued on through our post-bellum * colonialism and imperialism * as americans in annexing more territory from the natives on our continent , in the outlying islands , and against other powers like the spanish , that persisted right up until the establishment of a further federal apparatus to complement this federal warmaking policy - our central bank . 
  then ww1 broke out , and the us as a rising power intervened in a european conflict as an assertive post-imperial power and came out sitting pretty . 
  the usa of the 1870s though to 1914 would 've * shocked * the early republic , because it was an imperialist power . 
  the interregnum was kind of boring , and * clearly * after ww2 we were a major world power . 
  ** but ** a lot of america 's history after the civil war is * very close * to the kinds of trends that many european nations went through . 
  look at us policy in the philippines , look at our wars with the spaniards , look at our subjugation of the various first american nations . 
  we had everything but a crowned family in washington d.c. for a lot of our history - - - same deal as what the europeans were doing , even if tempered by a lot of anti-federalist sentiment that still exists today . 
  ** furthermore ** we did it as a people who then and now , speak the same language , and largely existed with the same skin color , even if every so often a new demographic group would have to be folded in at ellis island and assimilated over a generation or two . 
  we simply never had massive pluralities of distinctly looking/speaking foreign people within our polity ( we 're developing that now , unfortunately - i do n't know what tensions it will bring , but i fear it will bring balkanization ) europeans looking towards the us as a model for federalization often overlook these truths - - which are uncomfortable truths . 
  these truths point out that the melting pot is n't a complete solution to the problems of individual identity , that assertiveness and martial prowess * does * have negatives , and that you ca n't just totally ignore ethnic history when you want to find some kind of common cause for people to rally around . 
   i think europe would need to go through something similar ( as an united entity ) in order for us to be truly united . 
  ** unless a frenchman is willing to give up being a frenchman , and a german is willing to give up being a german , so much so that all their children speak the same language in discussing policy - possibly not french or german at all - and speak it _ natively _ - there will not cease to be the sovereign and self interested french and german nations . 
  ** and it 's not just language .
