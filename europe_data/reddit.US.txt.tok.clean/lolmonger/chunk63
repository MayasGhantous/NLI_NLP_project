  it 's culture , too - - it 's not like canadians and americans are willing to dissolve into a single nation . 
  and it 's geography , too - - it 's not like the english and australian people would be willing to recombine into a supra-anglo nation again . 
  so , `` europeans '' have to ask themselves about these things - - is the price to be paid * worth * it ? 
  is the loss of independence * worth * union ? 
  it 's much like marriage ; a real , true union . 
  is it worth losing independence in order to build a life together ? 
  what are the terms ? 
  what will the children be raised with ? 
  right now the european union is like a polygamous relationship of girlfriends and boyfriends who have children out of wedlock and differential commitment to one another , differential love for one another , and different finances and the like , trying to be a `` family '' in the same way as the federal man and his state wife and territory mistress of the usa . 
  it 's just not going to work without some real honesty about what the relationship is going to be and who wears the pants and what the family budget is , and the like . 
  jesus fuck , and i thought we were letting the terrorists win with tsa searches . 
  what the fuck did we * do * to you germany ? 
  even the japanese stand up for themselves after being nuked twice - - where did the teutonic backbone go ? 
  * much * less restrictive than california or new york . 
  i 'd love for nys to have gun laws like the czech republic , and nyc to have gun laws like praha . 
  no but in your own country you can own ar-15s produced locally and many other wonderful offerings in pistol caliber carbines and revolvers and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns from hera , lothar , and walther and korth , and heckler & koch that americans ** can not ** if they live in new york state , for instance . 
  there simply are many facets in federal and state gun laws which mean that millions of americans live with stricter laws than do many europeans , even if there are * some * states with much more lax laws than anywhere in europe . 
  do you see what i 'm saying ? 
   do you know how restrictive some places in europe are ? 
  do you know how not restrictive some places in europe are compared to * some * places in the us ? 
   if you had said some places in usa are more retrictive than some places in europe i could have given you the benefit of the doubt , but your statement was absurd . 
  i said : `` many of us live with more restrictions than exist in europe . '', 
  ^ because many of us live with more restrictions than exist in europe . 
  show me a single country in europe that will put someone in prison for at least a decade for the crime of attaching a vertical foregrip to a gun whose barrel is less than 16 inches and has no shoulder stock . 
   there is not a single european country that has less strict gun laws than any american state . 
  absolutely there are . 
  in terms of importation of foreign arms , and barrel length laws almost ** every ** european nation has less strict gun laws than the entire united states because of our peculiar legal history in the nfa 's sbr clause and 922 ( r ) in the tax code . 
  secondly , between the czech republic where carry permits are * shall * issue when people meet legal requirements , as opposed to several us states being ` may issue ' ( where the legal possibility exists , but the actual dispensation of the right is at the discretion of legal authorities ) , even in terms of carrying firearms , there are millions of europeans who have it better than millions of americans . 
  and in terms of firearms of military pedigree and with modern ergonomics , many europeans can own firearms that people in new york can simply no longer buy because of their most recent ` assault weapons ' ban . 
  only in terms of a federal `` right '' to keep and bear arms , do all us states have more lax laws than all of europe . 
  in terms of actual practical access and ownership , there are simply many parts of the us with far , far stricter laws than exist in europe . 
  the czech republic , switzerland , germany , france , and the uk all have various laws which are * far * less strict than different states in terms of : carry , weapon ownership within the home , weapon type , weapon origin , weapon accessory ( including suppressors/moderators ) it 's not a zero sum game , dude . 
  many of us live with more restrictions than exist in europe . 
   democracy is a numbers game . 
  yeah , and if 51 vote to piss in the cornflakes of 49 , they might find that soon there are n't actually 100 in total anymore . 
   why does government keep wasting public money on stupid things like this ? 
  liberals construct all sorts of fucking retarded gun laws over here for the same reason conservatives keep coming up with retarded `` health '' laws that are targeted at abortion . 
  both of them basically just want to fundamentally strip away what are ( by dint of literally being written down in our constitution on the one hand , and via the supreme court saying so on the other ) individual rights of the people . 
  so because they ca n't have outright bans , they just put as many little stupid material barriers to the exercise of a right in as they possibly can . 
  it 's really cunty . 
  that 's not contradictory . 
  the ability to continually pay dividends on bonds and other national debt obligations ( whether they 're instruments for trade or not ) is n't something that inherently requires steady economic growth * if * the finances of the country do n't mean they 're taking on more and more and more debt . 
  put another way ; even if you ignore for the moment that nation states have * far * greater ability to borrow real liquidity and issue their own currency and * tax * , and you view them only as a single person who is an income earner that 's just * breaking even * over and over and over again in payments of rent and taxes against their income ... ... * that 's stable * . 
  if someone is doing that at a high level because their cashflow is so regular then * even if * their expenses are pretty severe , so long as they are n't becoming more and more indebted , their payment obligations ( usually through debt , sometimes through long term contracts like leases ) are favorably rated . 
  the entire concept of a mortgage for instance , is based on this idea . 
  * very often * there are penalties for paying off a mortgage * too soon * ; what good is taking on your debt if it does n't mean cashflow for the person who holds that kind of risk ? 
  so , yes , in pure growth terms : finland is a ` sick man ' economy , where it 's expected that with some kind of recovery there 'd be more growth than is present , or that * something * has happened pathologically to its growth ability . 
  * it 's also entirely possible that the finnish government is fine being this way . 
  * because they just want healthy credit , to meet their financial obligations , and do n't care so much about constant economic growth * over * stability . 
  so long as finland does n't start accumulating debt , and so long as finns are able to live comfortably and make a future for themselves , i think that aaa rating is totally acceptable . 
   you can get a gun easier than getting on the road legaly . 
  yep . 
  we beat the empire on the basis of the crowns ' native security rebelling and the people joining against all that you sent after to stamp them down and tax our tea !, 
  we were still british then and you intended to tax our * tea * !, 
  any wonder we made owning firearms a right ? 
  tea !, 
  tea , for god 's sake , man !, 
  i 've heard of people getting that ... ** and ** carrying their actual firearm along with the gas pistol . 
  their rationale being that any kind of detection/police stop means they can simply produce their permit and their gas pistol . 
  but in any kind of true life of death situation , they can use their actual pistol and hope for better treatment by the law given the circumstances than risking death . 
  oh , i 'm aware . 
  just was n't sure how much nuance was needed to compare the situations . 
  i want them all gone/denied any kind of employment/social services and no more amnesty . 
  we wo n't even need to deport them at that point and if we get rid of the birthright citizenship they keep abusing . 
  i agree , and we need to get rid of it and almost all social services for illegals . 
  yep . 
  and people in paris and berlin can own rifles of military pedigree while you ca n't , and it 's possible for people in prague ( who are very patient ) to even own machine guns on top of getting carry licenses more easily than you . 
  but we have a `` right '' to keep and bear arms . 
   there is virtually no primary source evidence to indicate they gassed people and they logistically could not have murdered more than roughly 500 000 jews . 
  are you for fucking real ? 
  there are thousands and thousands of recorded testimonies including everyone from the literal nazis put on trial for it , to the sonderkommandos forced to load fellow prisoners into ovens . 
   they logistically could not have murdered more than roughly 500 000 jews . 
  * oh yes they fucking could , because they had camps after camps with industrial scale gassing and ovens *  many of the ` jews ' they targeted were not jews but germans who were considered ` mischling ' yeah , and several * million * were jews , on top of the millions more of slavs , dissidents , mentally and physically disabled , etc. 
   but it 's undoubtable that the allies have been exploiting the atrocities against the jews for political purposes are you from australia or the islamic republic of iran ? 
   america deports more than 400,000 mexicans a year and they are still struggling with a massive illegal immigration problem . 
  we actually deport those people though ; the problem is that many illegals will simply vanish ( even if they had interaction with immigration authorities beforehand ) into a large ( soon to be nationwide plurality , actually ) ethnic bloc sympathetic to them , and we have 10 + million . 
  there actually are thousands and thousands loaded up on buses and taken back to mexico each year over the course of a year . 
  and it 's nothing like the distance between sweden and syria/outside the eu it 's literally across a border . 
   i just wonder how capable sweden is in forcefully deporting the illegal migrants , i doubt many will go willingly . 
  * or any other nation in europe * seriously - - 80 * thousand * people ? 
  has * any * european nation had to do that with the current crop of illegal immigrants ? 
  a test case for what might have to be eu wide ... 
  not really . 
  german laws allow people to own quite a bit ( actually , even some more than is acceptable in certain us states ... ) - - though their use in self defense is another matter . 
  here are some german redditors who have contributed to / r/guns : https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/2ycke7/range_sunday_in_germany/ https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/3337mi/another_saturday_morning_in_germany/ https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1kmfs4/custom_ar15_from_germany_album/ https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/i3hkj/gunnitor_from_germany_finally_got_my_gun_license/ cue : new york and new jersey residents holding their heads in their hands . 
  not a substantial amount of our political spectrum that wants to see our firearms laws made as strict as they are in a few cities and states ( worse off , actually , than several eu nations ... ), 
  quite awhile unless you 've decided that german people arming themselves is tacitly racist and murderous because wanting to protect oneself is the same as deciding to commit ethnicity targeted killings . 
  ... well , to be fair to the serbian government then ( and uh ... and later ... sorry about the 90 's ) , that sort of advice is actually good for the people to have in the case of an airstrike or disaster . 
  it 's definitely creepy , though , for sure . 
  the us has the [ eas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnlup4ndjgq ) system for television and radio ( to take the place of air raid sirens and the like . 
  it got pretty well lampooned in a video game , [ which had the same kind my television ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xexd7t16v8s ) got when i was kid during massive storms and stuff . 
  http://www.gouvernement.fr/en/how-to-react-in-the-event-of-a-terrorist-attack ^ to be fair to the french , this kind of thing is legitimate advice , and other western governments do the same kind of '' be a partner in public safety ! '', 
  stuff, 
   why they are `` national socialists '' is because their polices had multiple socialist points . 
  which is n't anything unusual for right-wing parties . 
  the nazis are only ever called `` far right '' because of their authoritarianism and their nationalism - - features shared also by the bolshevik communists who came to create the soviet union ( and who themselves labeled them ` fascists ' ) and were * nationalistic * socialists who rejected the international character of marxist ideology which sought global union . 
  that hitler opposed the ideas of dialectical class struggle - - - all the while leading a * literal worker 's party revolution * to overthrow what he * rails on and on * about in mein kampf as the bourgeoisie ( one of the chapters is literally `` the sins of the bourgeoisie '' ) - - and opposed the international character of marxism in favor of a * germanic * and parochial socialism ... ... does not at all mean that he was not a national socialist . 
  the entire term is there to spell out that he views the principles of socialism as best applied to ` the volk ' of his own nation . 
  he ** spouted ** constant welfare advocacy in his speeches . 
  the winter relief campaign led by goebbels and minister darre , the so called `` hot pot sunday '' was where the `` comrades '' would all go without a sunday roast in order to collectively distribute to the german people .
