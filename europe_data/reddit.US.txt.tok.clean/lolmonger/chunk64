  the whole fucking thing was * ultra-nationalist racist socialism * . 
  it was * still * socialism . 
  it was n't `` right wing '' , even if it was murderous authoritarianism . 
  _____________ stalin was n't `` right wing '' , either , just in case that bullshit ever gets trotted out ... . 
   how are those left-wing ideals ? 
  the wealth redistribution and social welfare was left wing , and it was ** motivated ** by their racism and racial purity . 
  the whole notion of a volkisch state was one where the people and the state were a unified collective solidarity that guarded and propagated itself . 
  what do you think all the ein reich , ein volk , ein fuhrer stuff was ? 
  why do you think hitler * constantly * advocated socialist policies ? 
  * why do you think goebbels hated capitalism so much ? 
  * they were outright national socialists . 
  the nazis are only ever called `` far right '' because of their authoritarianism and their nationalism - - features shared also by the bolshevik communists who came to create the soviet union ( and who themselves labeled them ` fascists ' ) and were * nationalistic * socialists who rejected the international character of marxist ideology which sought global union . 
   all of them . 
  * oh , so the social welfare and wealth redistribution policies and totality of the state were * right wing ? 
   the german right wing has policies the american right would find to their left . 
  oh , is that so ? 
  and what characterizes the german left ? 
   they had many : ** what were they ? 
  **  you are applying american politics too much . 
  and you are completely ignoring * pure socialism and a love of the welfare state * pouring out of the mouth of adolf hitler himself , and * pure socialist leftist hatred of capitalism * being penned by goebbels himself . 
  the nazis were ** left wing ** authoritarian murderers and you a making a completely unwarranted fabrication and conflation to say that they were `` right wing '' . 
  ** nonsense ** the national socialist german workers party , the nazi party , was left wing what were their `` right wing '' policies ? 
  this constant conflation of * horrible * people with `` right wing '' people is a canard of the left , which can not reconcile the fact that its policies were adored by mass murderers like stalin , like hitler , like mao . 
  ** look at how hitler himself speaks about national socialism ** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reavwtl4ece * hitler was a socialist . 
  * ** hitler hated capitalism ** ___________ and goebbels ? 
  http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/goeb64.htm `` capitalism and bolshevism have the same jewish roots , two branches of the same tree that in the end bear the same fruit . 
  international jewry uses both in its own way to suppress the nations and keep them in its service . '', 
  ** the national socialists , the nazis were _ left wing _ ** ** the nazis hated capitalism . 
  ** their entire anti-semitic rhetoric was an anti-business , anti-capitalism , pro-welfare , pro-purity , pro-worker , socialist rhetoric . 
  **  at the center of national politics , are not the interests of multinational corporations , but the well-being of every german in a friendly and supportive community . 
  the npd upholds the order of the nation-state , under which our people maintain their values , ensure their security , their future , and the material conditions of their life and their guaranteed survival in the 21st century . 
  the preservation of our people and the protection of all of its members must be the primary goal of german policy . 
   ** for us there can be no nation-state without a given social ( welfare ) - state , and no national solidarity without social solidarity . 
  ** _____________ but over and over again , you on the left resort to the same chorus : `` right wing right wing right wing '' _____________ so , what , exactly , are the `` right wing '' policies of these `` right wing '' groups you speak of ? 
   more like it and stuff . 
  come to america . 
  make bank . 
  choose whether to have children here or go back . 
   i have a hard time seeing a scenario where killing is preferable to deportation . 
  that scenario is where the consequences of not killing endanger exactly those that the idealized situation of deportation sought to bring about . 
  which is utter nonsense . 
  the united states have free travel between themselves because they are all part of a single federal government , where whatever parts of their state borders that are externally facing are * federal * borders . 
  the whole idea of the schengen zone should n't have been pursued unless there was to be a federal border security apparatus for the whole thing , for the whole eu . 
  all of this federal obligation without federal due diligence , and federal carts before the federal horse is going to be the complete undoing of the eu . 
  also , would n't it do precisely nothing in terms of being able to prosecute terrorist suspects ? 
  my understanding is that frenchmen have no special rights over others under the law to commit atrocities ... 
  what kind of nonsense reporting from the bbc ? 
  they could n't write directly about the stripping of citizenship from terror suspects and instead spent nearly the whole article writing about the fact that she 's black , a ` left wing shield ' for hollande , and that she 's suffered racist criticism from ` the right wing ' . 
  the juxtaposition of these could n't be more obviously intended to suggest that all the discomfort with her and the push for her resignation/support for the stripping of citizenship was wholly a product of racism . 
  why ca n't the actual subject - - stripping citizenship from terrorists , just be the focus of the article itself ? 
  that 's clearly the most pressing issue . 
  could german redditors chime in on how significant this is for merkel 's governing prospects/reelection prospects ? 
  how important are these people in the electorate ? 
  sort of . 
  stanag agreements are n't that deep in terms of logistics . 
   an assault rifle is not a machine gun ffs !, 
  did n't stop the hk/the german army from attempting to build a dedicated machinegun variant of the g36 - the mg36 . 
  they still offer militaries the ability to buy the g36 , but they no longer offer the mg36 . 
  http://www.heckler-koch.com/en/products/military/machine-guns/mg4/mg4ke/overview.html their machinegun offerings are pretty much an hk version of the fn herstal lmg . 
  _______ on top of that , the previous g3 rifle ( and all the roller locked designs ) were ** fine ** , and they had a completely fleshed out line of everything from pistols and subguns to rifles and heavy machineguns , all with similar controls and operating principles . 
  reunification killed the last in the series because budget priorities changed , the g41m ( which was to be a nato update of the hk 33 ) , and hk built the g36s for the new german military . 
  that 's also driven largely by their immigrants from cultures which are not post-sexual revolution . 
  i have no ties to ukraine , but i thought this kind of complete and total apathy stopped in the 90 's . 
  i thought europe and the west just shrugging their shoulders and saying `` not our problem , whatever '' was something that ended in the balkans and breakup of yugoslavia . 
  i thought it was ( at least !, 
  how awful ) only something they would do towards conflict in places they had little political ties with like asia and africa . 
  i ca n't imagine what it must be like to see people on the same continent see part of your nation being taken by force , and wondering only when it will look okay to do business with the aggressor . 
  it would be , if those immigrants could truly ` take the place ' of german society , in terms of integrating into their economic demands on labor , taxes for pensions , and culture - - germany * remaining germany * is presumably a desirable thing . 
  ** if economic solvency is all that is wanted : ** then just draw an outline on a map so that the constituent geography has the right demographic age structure , the right kind of earnings , and long term health . 
  then label it germany . 
  if that does n't sound like a solution , then * pretty obviously * western nations which want ** their ** societies revitalized should n't pick revitalization options that totally change their societies into something else .

  ______________ i did not choose to be born to my mother . 
  she has her faults , she has her flaws . 
  i do n't pretend she 's perfect . 
  i still love my mom , and what 's more , i love her as a mother * more than i could ever appreciate one of your mothers . 
  * i 'm sure your almost mothers are all nice people . 
  i am not going to speak ill of anyone 's mother to their face , even if they do n't seem like very good moms . 
  and i do n't care that some people 's moms did n't nag as much or were better cooks , etc. 
  i love my mom . 
  she 's * my mom * . 
  this is the way i feel about the united states of america . 
  take away all the money , take away all the power , all the economic heft and martial strength . 
  take away all of that . 
  i still love america . 
  i 'm attached to its culture , i 'm attached to its history . 
  i know it is n't perfect . 
  there 's plenty to criticize - - i tell my own mom off when she 's being a huge nag . 
  what kid does n't ? 
  [ what about something like this ?

  it 's like someone punching our mom . 
  ** so on economic grounds ** maybe my mom is n't the best cook in the world . 
  maybe someone else 's mom makes food my siblings really enjoy . 
  ** what kind of kids would we be , if we decided to replace our mom and choose to call some other woman ` mother ' because we liked her cooking better ?
