  ** ___________________ that there might be economic deficiencies in a nation , is no reason to dissolve bonds between countrymen , of nationhood , and import another people - - - it is ** only ** a reason to improve one 's own house . 
  * first they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they set your cars on fire , then you win . 
  the west 's governments should take that money and dump it into domestic hydrocarbons and alternative energy . 
  the sooner the middle east left alone , the better - - they need to work their shit out just like the former christendom did . 
  i 'd bet there are just enough non-traditional students and ` outlier ' aged students that it just fucks the straight average a little bit . 
  20,20,21,19,20,21,20,21,19,18,20 =  average age is about 20 20,20,21,19,20 , * 28 * ,20,21,19 , * 25 * , * 24 * =  average age is about 22 . 
  just a couple students who are very young * instead * being students who are very old ( well , not that 18 year olds are babies or that 28 year olds are decrepit , but you know what i mean ) can shift averages in ways that are n't intuitive . 
  the weights are just different . 
  if you go in expecting a normal distribution ... ehhh , it 's just better to use simple medians if you 're only reporting one number . 
  do it . 
   28 you know how hard it is to just * go somewhere * when you 're working for longer than two days . 
  ** young people - - travel while you can !, 
  they seem to be including masters and phd students , though ; there 's probably enough of them ( and a few outliers ) to tilt the mean and median a couple years up above what those expected values would be for the majority . 
  and when western leaders visit iran once the sanctions are lifted to talk business , iran wo n't be executing any gays !, 
  also this line :  he asked `` forgiveness for the un-gospel like behaviour by catholics towards christians of other churches '' . 
  but all the non-christians persecuted , killed , and forcibly converted by the church ? 
  he 's still not very serious about addressing the sex abuse cases . 
  we still have parish shuffling overlooked by the vatican . 
  no , he is implying it 's for their own interests . 
  that 's the point - it 's good to see that there are at least a few nations who believe common defense with the ukrainians is in their interest . 
  i know that . 
  i 'm clearly not talking about nato in that statement . 
  does that mean a nation is not european ? 
  if they do n't have the right piece of paper ? 
  is the eu really a european union of european values ? 
  or is it nothing more than a paperwork of functionaries and diktat from franco-german interests for the continent under its control ? 
  apparently it was just to make a big show of giving a shit . 
  are ukrainians not european ? 
  think of all the sympathy the eu masters are asking their people to have for refugees and migrants . 
  think of all the money being spent . 
  think of all the policing of rhetoric , all the policy deafness . 
  they 're threatening to * exclude greece - still in financial crisis - with expulsion from schengen because of a refugee influx they ca n't handle and had no hand in causing !, 
  * but are the ukrainians european ? 
  what are the shared ideals of the eu , then ? 
  recapitalization of german and french banks ? 
  slacking off on defense spending so nato does it ? 
  is ukraine worthy of no western and european solidarity ** solely because it is n't a paper signatory ? 
  ** is that all the eu is ? 
  is that all it means to be a european ? 
  to capitulate when it means promise of a nord stream 2 ? 
  everyone who is okay with these sanctions being lifted is saying that in the name of business , in the name of economic prosperity , they are perfectly willing to accept europeans being killed so long as they do n't have the right piece of paper on file with brussels . 
  they are saying the prospect of renewed business is more attractive than russian annexing parts of a sovereign nation is repulsive . 
  are ukrainians europeans or not ? 
  and if we have determined them to be europeans , but not members of a political union , and therefore acceptably undefended and uncared for , then what is the shared sentiment of the eu ? 
  whence all the moral posturing on values and substantial rights for refugees and migrants who are not europeans * at all * ? 
  and if they are european and not orientals best kept under the boot of the former soviet ? 
  then what a miserable thing the union is - and woe to any who claims there is too much american influence over nato . 
  apparently the defense of europe is too important a matter to leave to the europeans . 
  if we got millions and millions of young european people , young * culturally western people * who were educated , and here to work , start businesses , pay taxes , and own property , and * reproduce * ( that matters ) - not to get welfare , not to drive down wages , not to only be unskilled labor , not to stress our public systems , etc. 
  it would be a blessing . 
  if we could simply invest in natalist policies and repudiate mass illegal immigration and h1b abuse , and bring our immigration numbers under control , while taking hard steps to improve our labor to capital fit without involving foreign peoples , that would be far better . 
   this must be a referrence to the end of history thesis - that western liberal democracy has won , no more wars , and the greatest problem for us ` last men ' is , basically boredom . 
  fukuyama 's book on the matter is basically one big neoliberal globalist pat on the back . 
  the best and only wealth in the world , is the wellbeing of your own people . 
  the west has lost its fertility , it has ceased being a civilization that prioritizes the youth : their families , their lives , their incomes , their ownership , their renewal . 
  the youth are only good for cheap labor , for consumer spending backed up by debt , for payments into the pensions of the old . 
  and because they are not enough , the elites are panicking as they seek to do anything , even giving up national identities , to import youthful , prolific people from abroad . 
  #what economic output do you expect from people who can never have children ? 
  the old can not retire , the young can not start families , adolescence is perpetuated . 
  the imbalance of those who are producing , those who are consuming , those who are on their way out of life and those who are supposed to be entering it has become the * norm * . 
  the economics of a household !, 
  without children , why would you buy more than what you need for yourself ? 
  work to earn more than what you need for yourself ? 
  invest in the future and not just the now ? 
  and if you are old and must support adults ? 
  how can you stop working to make room if it means they will do without ? 
  all because we stopped being a civilization that prioritizes its own renewal . 
   you ca n't yell `` fire '' in a crowded theater yes you can . 
  justice oliver wendell holmes made that argument in a supreme court decision which was to uphold sedition laws criminalizing anti-war propaganda distributed by immigrant socialists in ww1 . 
  later scotus decisions have completely repudiated that kind of rhetoric ( which is n't even what holmes was going for - he changed his mind later , too , clarifying himself to be on the side of speech , not restriction ) you can shout `` fire ! '', 
  in a crowded theater . 
  that 's totally legal . 
  what you ca n't expect is to be free of legal prosecution if you falsely claim fire , and people get hurt in a stampede to leave . 
  or if you 're told to leave a private theater for being an ass and you refuse . 
   you also ca n't say `` i 'm going to kill these people '' without getting questioned by the police . 
  yes , direct threats of violence are illegal . 
  unless you 're inciting imminent lawless action ( or being obscene by transmitting kiddy porn or something ) however , you ** can say whatever you want . 
  ** for example , * hess * 1973 , the supreme court found that because someone 's speech : `` amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time '' , it could n't be prosecuted in ** any way ** by any authority in the us . 
  we have actual free speech here in the us for political ideas , even if they say things like `` at some point , the people are going to have to start shooting at law enforcement and the military , overthrowing the government and killing those who resist , because our politics have become tyrannical '' * especially * if they say things like that , actually . 
  it 's baked into the literal constitution of our laws . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-05/nra-backed-law-spells-out-when-indianans-may-open-fire-on-police at least one state outright passed a law explicating the legal grounds on which citizens can use lethal force against cops who are violating laws governing their ability to enter your property . 
   i think 15 is the perfect age of consent , as long as there 's no significant age difference between partners , because it 's the age at which you can have sex without being fucked up for the rest of your life . 
  but 14 is n't ? 
  and it 's impossible for someone to make really bad decisions or otherwise become sexually traumatized at 16 ? 
  i mean , come on - - that the laws are n't obvious and universal across similar cultures and jurisdictions is pretty much proof no one really has a good answer to the many misfits between biology and modern society . 
  it 's not like how picking up a hammer , walking over to someone you do n't know and bashing them in the head is illegal ** everywhere ** no matter what , because there 's basically nothing that ever justifies doing it for a normal person . 
   as soon as you allign with either side , there is a nuclear missile with at least a capitals name written on it . 
  before you join , your territory is simply staging ground for conventional forces to invade and hold before any nuclear war . 
   we ca n't count on nato or eu o help us if the shit hits the fan big-time . 
  you probably can . 
  it 's not like the nato nations that carry nato have * any * interest in russia being able to invade and occupy friendly western nations with which they have trade interests . 
  http://www.defense.gov/news-article-view/article/604686/work-swedish-defense-minister-discuss-nato-military-cooperation  during the 30-minute meeting , work assured hultqvist of the u.s. commitment to bilateral cooperation , nato 's enhanced opportunity partner initiative as it relates to sweden , and deterring russian aggression , the release said . 
   the deputy secretary lauded sweden 's continued leadership in the nordic-baltic region , and voiced support for joint training and exercises designed to sustain sweden 's interoperability with nato . 
  http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/transfers/transparency/national_reports/sweden/swe02eng.pdf  sweden is also taking part in another american initiative , the defense trade security initiative ( dtsi ) , which was launched in 2000 . 
  the purpose of this initiative is to improve the effectiveness of the american licensing procedure , to encourage interoperability and standardization between the usa and countries closely associated with the usa , to facilitate transatlantic industrial joint ventures and to raise the common level of technology production between the collaborating countries . 
  following a decision on the part of the usa , sweden joined this initiative in the summer of 2001 . 
  the previous partners were the nato states , japan and australia . 
   one aim of the initiative is eventually to open negotiations between the usa and sweden on a general exemption from the provisions of the international traffic in arms regulations ( itar ) . 
  similar negotiations are already under way between the usa and the united kingdom and australia . 
  the previous agreement between the usa and canada in this area serves as a model in this context too .
