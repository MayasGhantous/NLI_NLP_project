  it would be bad security , and bad business , for nato to ignore sweden . 
  from this article :  the video makes it clear that the paris attacks were not just inspired by the islamic state , but rather carried out by core members of the terrorist group , who had been trained and vetted in syria before being tapped to carry out attacks on european soil . 
  it also aims to show that the assailants -- some of whom had european passports -- had been carrying out atrocities in the group 's name long before their return to europe . 
  http://www.wsj.com/articles/paris-stadium-attacker-entered-europe-via-greece-1447698583  police on leros registered the man under the identity in the passport he showed them : ahmad almohammad , 25 , from syria . 
  the same passport was found near the man 's body outside the stadium on friday night . 
   whoever the man was , he posed as one of the many refugees fleeing syria 's war -- including the violence of islamic state -- to enter europe through its lightly controlled frontier in the aegean sea . 
  _______________ 130 dead what have the eu and constituent nations done to prevent this from happening again ? 
  it 's a good match . 
  india 's policy is n't just for good equipment , but health relations with as many nations as possible through defense acquisitions . 
  tn kaul 's policies of non-alignment and non-entanglement are still basically the premise of the entire defense/foreign policy establishment of india , and they jive very nicely with what de gaulle attempted in having a ` third way ' outside of nato during the cold war . 
  the single best way to combat this would be for the vast majority of moderate people to install moderate politicians who are willing to speak openly about the reasonable concerns reasonable people have - - to not have police forces unsure about whether they can mention race , to not have academics shouting down people uncomfortable with changing demographics as nothing but vile racists - - and to then address those reasonable concerns reasonable people have , in a way that upholds secular , pluralist , large-hearted and * sensible * western values . 
  it would : 1 ) solve a lot of bullshit 2 ) completely undercut the rhetoric of hate groups,

  ' a man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance ' eu has basically just been the cowardly slacker who makes excuses of caution and strain . 
  __________________ i mean the eu only insofar as whatever actions it takes are the sum of its member nations , not that the eu is in fact a specific polity ( i do n't think it is , for a variety of reasons , a true political entity at all , though it is set up with the intention of being one ) . 
  from my point of view , ~ ~ the jediare evil ~ ~ only certain nations within it truly have a sense of * people * whose government is meant not only to govern , but act in consonance with their will ; states which are nationalistic , and it is they who have the hallmarks of doership : moving quickly to speak honestly and act accordingly about the problem , instead of waffling . 
  nah , we generally just stick to winning the olympics , ignoring that soccer is real while we have the super bowl , and putting military bases everywhere . 
  heheh seriously , though : i wish we could trade out the superbowl for sports like tennis and water polo . 
  i loved swimming in highschool , but i * really * loved when we 'd play it during practices to condition the new guys and take a break from laps and pushups . 
  it 's just such a combination of physicality and tactics and individual contest and collaboration all in one go . 
  i really miss it . 
  it 's a real shame . 
  it requires school systems to have large clean pools and swimming instruction/safety for many students for a long time ( already expensive ) , and out of the people playing it , a great deal of competitive , killer instinct and drive * as well * as focused team work . 
  sadly i just do n't see either very prioritized anywhere . 
   neither does nasa yeah , but we will if [ current political priorities do n't shift dramatically ] ( https://www.nasa.gov/content/nasas-journey-to-mars )  it 's not that much more difficult to find the money for esa than for nasa - the eu and us economies have roughly the same size have you been looking at the eu 's issues lately ? 
  in trying to find money and political agreement for border security or migrant relocation or financial aid , there seems to be almost no cohesion whatsoever . 
  it 's silly to simply compare dollar amounts and assume that because the outline drawn around a certain landmass means it has roughly the same economic output , that the landmass is politically cohesive enough to set a priority and fund it the same way as another . 
  esa 's current budget is : $ 5.15 billion from a slew of different countries with different economies and different political structures . 
  nasa 's budget is $ 19.3 billion from a single federal government which does n't have to quibble much over 0.643 % of the total budget . 
   its overpriced . 
  says you . 
  not the defense planners of several different governments with decades long careers in doing what they do who have recommended its adoption . 
  you replace them now , or replace them in 20 years for even * more * money , with two decades ' persistent gap ( a widening gap ) between what a nato air force is supposed to do , and what it can do . 
  the poles are n't being meek and supplicative , and that bothers certain western nations almost as much as it bothers the russians . 
  i 'm happy for greece reaching * some * kind of stability after all that 's happened , but a credit upgrade should be based on real numbers and real economic improvements . 
  ... so should a downgrade for that matter . 
  no , but any russian invasion of germany would involve attacking poland or another nato country , so germany just slacks entirely on having a real military and instead cozies up to their national business interests even when it means ignoring the concerns of other europeans , other eu nations , fellow nato members - whoever . 
  use force to defend a national border ?!, 
   there is no threat to germany that could invade us . 
  because poland stands in the way . 
  when people do n't give a fuck about your very basic laws , why are they going to submit to a higher order legal apparatus ? 
   to me it seems like you actually deliberately want to weaken nato by making standards so high that they are unrealistic . 
  so high ? 
  so * high * ? 
  almost * no * nato members are doing what they 're supposed to do . 
   are baltics also just dead weight that should be kicked out from nato , because they certainly ca n't do anything else than just to protect their own countries , if even that ? 
  ** good thing i literally wrote several sentences explaining why smaller nations ca n't be expected to meet spending guidelines just yet , in the comment of mine you initially responded to , huh ? 
  **  perhaps denmark and norway should be ditched too , surely they do n't bring much to table ? 
  more nations that want to do what denmark and norway ... ... and germany and france and portugal , etc. 
  do with nato spending and commitment ** should n't ** be invited to nato , that 's for sure . 
   you are forgetting a simple fact . 
  more men , tanks and planes means more power to nato . 
  not if their addition is n't commensurate with what 's required of existing members in nato who are obligated to defend them if they 're attacked . 
  but then again :  frankly , i do n't understand your logic . 
   the point is that finland is never going to have significant power projection capabilities they should at least ( at the very minimum ) be spending 2 % of gdp if they want to join nato * now * because they 're upset about russia 's actions . 
   well if finland were a part of nato defending yourself is still part of defending nato . 
  that ca n't be the only thing a nato member contributes towards . 
  ** american troops are obligated to go fight and die in the event poland is invaded . 
  ** do you get that ? 
  if you join the united states military , and you 're part of infantry operations in any way , your duty that you swear to * also includes shooting at and getting shot at * in the defense of poland and polish national interests . 
  ( among many , many other places ) that is what it means to be in an alliance ; not just that everyone is obligated to protect you - - that you are also obligated to go and protect the others . 
  finnish military spending and capabilities * do not * allow it the ability ( assuming the will ) to go and defend other nations . 
  unless its nato membership was accompanied by significant increases in spending , what would it be offering ? 
  more territory the russians would love to invade in the event of a conflict with non-neutral ( that 's what it means to join ) nato powers , and from which further attacks could be staged - - - more territory to be defended by everyone else in nato . 
  that 's deadweight . 
   every nato member has defensive systems and expenditure that are oriented towards defending the homeland not towards defense of nato . 
  and in addition , they if they 're meeting a 2 % gdp guideline and doing inter-force training , are building capabilities meant for defending other nato members . 
  right now nato already has way too much deadweight on that grounds . 
   the thing about mutual defense is that its best if we never have to do it . 
  yeah , the thing about locking your door at night is that it 's best if no one ever tries breaking in , too . 
  get a stronger lock and door , or do n't ask other people to be obligated to look out for your house . 
   even with 1.4 % of gdp , nato will be stronger with finland ( and sweden ) as it 's members . 
  ** why ? 
  ** because i guarantee you that finland and sweden joining nato will further upset the russians . 
  its more territory and people to defend in the event of conflict , with * what * kind of native capacity to defend it exactly ? 
   we are n't a big nation , but we have conscription unlike many other countries in europe . 
  this means that there are hundreds of thousands men in finland who already are trained to use weapons and to work together as a team to defend finland what exactly , is added , except for the obligation of nato to come help finland ? 
  finnish defense spending * is entirely built around the ability to only defend finland * that has to greatly increase if finland is going to be part of a cooperative defense alliance . 
   additionally our position is strategically important for the protection of the baltics agreed , which is why the russians , if there is ever complete war between them and ` the west ' or a nato power , or the eu , will probably be invading finland at some point , * unless finland stays totally neutral . 
  * certainly not if they join nato . 
  ______________________ finland ca n't just add on obligations for other people to protect it , and keep its own ability to fight only in obligation to itself . 
  nato ca n't afford that . 
   why would anyone want to spend more money than needed on something that will only be needed if hell brakes loose ? 
  because you do n't want to find out that you did n't spend :  more money than needed but actually * less * money than needed when `` hell breaks loose '' . 
  considering , also , that hell breaking loose in this situation is open warfare . 
  the price of learning you were inadequately prepared is paid in dead young men . 
   nato was a good choice for norway , denmark , estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland ... we would be in good company . 
  nato does n't need more members who do n't spend at least 2 % of gdp on modern military hardware and troop training , though . 
  estonia , poland , the uk , and greece ( greece ! ), 
  spend the guideline amount on forces . 
  the us and the uk are the only powers among those which are reasonably capable of dedicating troops to large ` internal ' ( internal for nato ) defense deployments like atlantic resolve , or the uk 's scheduled deployment of troops to poland . 
  i 'm not saying the us should feel complete hubris or anything . 
  nations like latvia and lithuania have hardly had a chance to have economies and polities free from soviet domination . 
  nations like croatia and slovenia , only recently came out of the former yugoslavia . 
  nations like bulgaria only recently came out of the warsaw pact . 
  those nations really * ca n't * be expected to just have a shit ton of cash lying around for military modernization and the like . 
  their economies did n't have marshall plan aid . 
  they did n't get to be part of the globalization of capital services in the waning days of the cold war . 
  ____________ but there are nations which did and do n't contribute . 
  joining nato simply ca n't continue to be about having security for free if you do n't have the cash , or worse - having security and not paying when you * do * have the cash .
