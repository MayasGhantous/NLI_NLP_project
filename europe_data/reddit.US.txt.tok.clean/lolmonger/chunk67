  ________ finnish gdp is 260 some billion dollars ; it 's defense budget is currently 2.8 some billion dollars . 
  it 's * around * 1.4 % of gdp . 
  now will finland , if it joins nato , be another one of those nations that ca n't spend the money ? 
  or another one of those nations that does n't * want * to spend the money ? 
  and will it spend more than the bare minimum recommendation ? 
  russia does n't have the hard currency earnings to do more than object to a finnish-swedish alliance . 
  at best , they can sponsor and encourage the chattering classes to wring their hands at any `` aggressive '' western overtures that involve merely promising to defend one another if attacked . 
  nope . 
  like the us arming `` mujahideen '' in afghanistan in the 80s , ` peshmerga ' is a pretty generic term . 
  in the same way mujahid is simply in arabic one who does ` jihad ' ( which is general as it gets for an armed combatant who happens to be muslim and has rationalized his political objectives in that lens ) , in kurdish : p\u00ea\u015f-merg ; `` before death '' - - confronting death . 
  ( c.f. 
  sanskrit : pa\u015bya mrty\u00fa - ` look/face ' ` death ' , - pasa - as a root coming from metathesis of spacha * , c.f. 
  latin ` specere ' to look , mod . 
  german sp\u00e4hen ` to peer , to look ' ; more at english `` spy , espy something '' , mortal , mortality ; latin ` mortalis ' ` subject to death ' , sanskrit mrtih , old persian ` martiyh ' ) it just means `` the ones who behold/see death '' in kurdish , and the kurds happen to be indo-iranians . 
  it 's as general as you can get for a ` soldier ' and still be talking specifically about soldiers who happen to be kurdish . 
  it is * also * true that the krg call their forces `` peshmerga '' as an official matter , but that 's kind of like how the united states has : `` marines '' * sure * , but everyone else has `` marines '' , too . 
  it 's why it 's annoying to see people on reddit saying `` oh , but the west armed jihadists !, 
  oh but the west armed peshmerga ! '', 
  well , yeah , but which ones matter a lot !, 
  it would n't even be so disgusting if the left in the eu 's various nations , so willing to be generous on transnational grounds towards * foreign * people , could have been at least as generous as that towards their * own * people on grounds of common nationality . 
  in the us , we have the same thing ; bleeding hearts who want ( truly ) nothing more than to help every mexican , guatemalan , honduran , etc. 
  make them all comfortable and housed and employed . 
  keep families together , and all that . 
  to the massive numbers of unemployed and underemployed americans ? 
  particularly rural white poor ones ( whites constitute a majority of the poverty sector in the us , btw ) ? 
  `` haha fuck those people in fly over country , let 's watch some honey boo boo '' i 'm not a white person , nor economically disadvantaged , and it 's pretty fucking obvious what 's going on . 
   i 'm curious how the pkk shills are going to defend the pkk killing teachers , doctors and burning ambulances . 
  by glorifying their communism with a western-centric patronizing pride in the dark people 's adoption of the academician 's ideology , and making out their gender parity in their ranks to be more than it actually is . 
  same as they 've always done ; run around patting people on the head , so they can pat themselves on the back . 
  there should never have been an expansion of the eu until it was able to show that two sovereign nations could integrate completely and lose their sovereignty to one another . 
  food label standards , socket type and voltage regulations - - that 's all fine as domestic policy goes . 
  ** but a functioning nation does three things : security , economy , polity ** it protects itself , and its borders ; it has a fiscal/monetary policy of its own ; it has a political order which governments how changes in security and economy are done . 
  that 's it , that 's what modern nation-states are . 
  the eu has completely dropped the ball in all areas . 
  what is the ez ? 
  the ecb ? 
  what does it do for nations like greece as opposed to just helping germany and france ( or , rather , german and french * banks * because it clearly does n't help their taxpayers ) ? 
  what does the lisbon treaty really do that is n't outright handled primarily by nato ? 
  how is rulemaking even done ? 
  by fiat in brussels ? 
  by the council ? 
  by the parliament ? 
  if you 're a citizen of a state which is a member of the eu ; regardless of how different your country 's political apparatus is ( and there 's certainly variation ) - - a citizen of the united kingdom , or portugal , or germany , or bulgaria or sweden , etc. 
  ** if you are pro-eu : ** without looking it up : who passes the laws governing the currency you use ? 
  who and how determines things like interest rates when you borrow that currency ? 
  insurance against losses when you invest that currency ? 
  who passes the laws concerning * whatever * security forces that are obligated to protect you and the land you 're on from foreign invasion ? 
  who commands them ? 
  economy , and security , as controlled by polity : do you know , without looking it up , how those things are done ? 
  do you know where legislation comes from , and who votes on it ? 
  who has say on its passage or defeat ? 
  do you know who specifically protects you , and who commands them ? 
  i 'd wager most of you either do n't know for sure , or are else considering that 's there 's kind of a lot of complexity and redundancy in answering the question . 
  there 's really not that much expertise troops would need to have if a war broke out between russian and nato ... yet it wo n't , because it seems like the nato alliance ( at least insofar as auscanzukus + eastern europe + baltics is concerned ) gives a shit . 
  nato is the epitome of ` you need to have it so that you do n't need to have it ' . 
  with greater expenditure and inter-operability , and constant deployments like this , the likelihood of any future deterioration in russia 's relations with the west allowing * their * war planners the make any sort of calculation of war drops sharply . 
  so it 's important that `` our '' ( in the nato sense ) war planners collaborate and cooperate in peacetime , precisely so that they very likely never have to in war time . 
  well , yeah . 
  the `` peshmerga '' are n't a unified group ( the kurds are n't totally politically unified either ; why would all those kurds who take up arms be so ? 
  ) , and even the best-equipped and most ` near government ' organizations , regardless of their recognition by real states or embattled states , are fundamentally without : consistent cashflows from taxation of industry and citizen income to go to a defense apparatus . 
  which means they have to bootstrap their money situation , which means sometimes aid is going to be sold , sometimes stuff they take is going to be sold , etc. 
  if the west wants to solve that , pick a set of kurds , stick with them . 
  establish a government for them like we did israel , just carving out territory they claim for them , give them even more money and ammunition and weapons , and then have them defend their new polity so their people can get to the work of private industry so their families can get to the work of making babies and raising those babies to do work and defense and make more babies themselves . 
  until then , yeah - - they 're gon na sell the occasional aid supplied rifle or two or twenty because money is how you pay people to do stuff like buy food when they fight isis for you . 
  i do n't think it 's true for muslim men as a whole in germany , any european country - or anywhere else , actually . 
  but in my estimation it is true for significantly large numbers of men who are muslim and are as a product of their racial exclusion , socialization in a different culture , and resentments towards european society , deciding to lash out in a terrible way . 
   i still need some kind of a source for the left ( or liberals ) ever having decided that all cultures are fundamentally equal . 
  excluding , of course , baseline principle of equality that exists between people as individuals . 
  so ... you see where once we say that there is a baseline principle of equality between people , and accept that people can live in different cultures ... ... you see where this leads , right ? 
   i do , obviously , still hold that people and cultures are not analogous . 
  a culture can not have an agency , because a culture can not consciously act and therefore , it can not make decisions . 
  no , but a culture is a product of the aggregate decision making of a group of people who associate on the grounds of their decisions and norms about decisions . 
  it in turn influences the decision making and agency of any individual who is of that culture . 
   i do n't think that a concept like culture can even theoretically have such a thing as moral culpability . 
   it can only have incompatible/mismatching morals with a different culture . 
  do these sentences necessarily exclude each other ? 
  to press the point ( since you bring it up this way : `` i also do n't think a culture can have an agency , for that matter '' , too ) do you think moral culpability can exist for an individual ? 
  and is that a situation which is n't precisely when their agency and the morality of their actions is incompatible/mismatching the expectations of their culture or another culture or another * individual * ? 
  sure , they 're saying some sensible things . 
  yes , it 's certainly wrong to pretend that sexual violence is * purely * the domain of swarthy , dusky foreign savages and perpetrated against pure white virginal girls , and that europe is populated only with stoic virtuous men who want nothing more than to keep their hearth and home safe , and all their rhetoric and policy is as pure as a husband 's love for his wife and a father 's love for his children . 
  there 's been plenty of sexual violence and discrimination committed by men on a social institution basis for a long time in even the most enlightened western countries , sure . 
  and plenty of the policy agitation and spouting that 's been happening is kind a `` deport them all , airstrike the conflict areas , and let god sort them out '' attitude running through european politics . 
  that 's all well and dandy , and feminists and the left of politics are right to point out that it 's a little hypocritical that when `` others '' commit sexual violence , * then * it 's a salient problem , but was n't when they spoke about it before . 
  sure . 
  _________________ but then they go on to pretend that it 's ` unclear ' what happened , or that the motives of the attackers are inscrutable , or that there could be * no relation * between the culture of the masses of men coming to europe , and a heightened rate of sexual violence , because it * must * be true that all cultures are equal . 
  i think two things are happening here : third wave feminism has ascribed in their anger * so * much of what they do n't like * to masculinity * , that they have a reductive view of men - \\ #yesallmen as it were . 
  furthermore , the left in general , for quite a while , has decided that all cultures are fundamentally equal , or at least that in * sum * , no culture ( i 'm saying culture ; social norms and expectations , not race ) can be declared to be on the whole better than any other because it has too much intersectionality with the racism they rightly decried . 
  much as susan sontag once remarked that certain elements of the academic left did n't want to ` give comfort to reactionary ' conservatives by admitting/criticizing any failures or moral trespasses of the soviet regime ( a sentiment which actually earned her some leftwing hatred in the 80s !, 
  ) , i think on this second point , a lot of well intentioned leftists really , really , really , really do n't want to align themselves with or confirm any notions held by `` stormfront '' types - - so they not only repudiate ( correctly i 'd say ) racism , but any kind of discussion about cultural differences ( because ones there 's heterogeneity , * then come discussions of hierarchy * ) . 
  so these two impulses of the left ; not even the * radical * left , but the mainstream left , have left us with what these two , schwarzer and wizorek , are doing : very astutely pointing out the problems of the right and mainstream in assigning moral culpability to `` all migrants '' and ignoring the natively present issues of sexual assault and discrimination ... ... and entirely discounting the agency and moral culpability of * cultures in which sexual assault becomes a prescribed course and a massively followed course of action * for disenfranchised young muslim men in a european country . 
  ______________________ unless the left is willing to own some problems they 've created ( cf. 
  rotherham , german press downplaying the attacks , sweden 's `` no nothing '' policies ) they 're really just going to leave the political door wide open for exactly those elements they * do n't * wish to see become popular , and their media friends are inadvertently going to be not so much ushers telling people to exit , but aircraft carrier crew-like in how fast they guide people in . 
  ** edit/add-on ** i realize my poop-at-work-wax-philosophical tendency might make what i 'm saying kind of unclear . 
  but if we keep denying that there are problems with some male immigrants , then we will just drive the people into the arms of the right-wing populists . 
  without the ignorance or the trivialization on the part of all the political parties , there would be no pegida or alternative for germany ^ ^ ^ this is a crucial point schwarzer is making , and it 's one i think more ` modern ' feminists like wizorek are missing  spiegel : but does ms. wizorek not have a point when she asks why the conservative christian democrats suddenly discover a passion for women 's issues right when there are problems with refugees ? 
  ms. wizorek has a * goddamn good point * , and i think schwarzer is missing it because right here in her response :  schwarzer : that 's not a partisan question . 
  the same is true of the center-left social democrats . 
  it applies to all . 
  * the current outrage is very hypocritical . 
  but motives have n't been interesting to me for a long time now .
