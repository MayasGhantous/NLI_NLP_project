  do you import immigrants ? 
  hope your bien-pensant friends in the news media make sure to say `` immigrants '' and `` migrants '' and `` refugees '' are all the same and everyone should be okay with them because they 'll all integrate perfectly and add to the labor force , not the welfare rolls , and yet also displace no natives from either ? 
  what to do ? 
  what to do ? 
  _________________ no one really knows what to do , and i suspect it is * this * topic , this ugly , thorny , knotted and undulating problem involving everything from when and why and with whom people have sex , and get married and reproduce ( now three distinct things ) , to how many people rent vs buy , to whether young people are studying ` the right things ' , etc. 
  that gets obsessed about in heady meetings at davos . 
  and i do n't think the elites have any answer for the world they 've made . 
  wherever they 're from . 
  they 're not popping out of the ether , and faced with a choice of landing their dinghy into europe or not . 
  if that were true , sure , a total humanitarian argument could be made . 
  but european nations should n't have a primary responsibility to them - their own nations should . 
   germany needs an immigration policy similar to the american one which i like to call hand-picking immigration . 
  we 've destroyed that mostly , and that 's not even why immigration works out so well for the us . 
  we * do * have a broken system right now : we do still have the selection pressure on everywhere that * is n't * accessible by a landborder , but plenty of politicians have realized what a bounty of ethnic vote-bloc style politics they can get via latinos and everyone from * actual * latinos like rep. gutierrez are expressing loyalty to a `` community '' and `` people '' ( literally transnationally on the basis of shared ethnicity and family ) to just very cynical and manipulative sorts like hillary clinton ( though , to my amusement , plenty of latino activists called her out for attempting to cast herself as the political abuela of hispanics ) we have 10-15 million here now , and profound demographic shift already . 
  the blessing is that the vast majority of our en masse illegal immigration/refugee seeking has been basically the same community of people who legally came from latin america , and even though they self segregate and import bloc politics and depress wages in unskilled labor sectors , they ** do ** work like crazy and apart from defrauding the immigration system and minimal welfare systems ** do n't ** commit crimes . 
  latinos are western people . 
  that in itself , even if we kept our system as broken as it is , is the huge difference between europe and the us . 
  the crop of people who might come here in droves/break our immigration checks are n't entirely foreign to our way of life . 
  sure , a monolingual spanish speaking honduran who does n't really give a fuck about america , does n't want to integrate with anglos and will gladly join with a premade community in bloc politics as the us 's demographics change is n't * great * from a conservative perspective . 
  but there 's no risk of radicalization around a religious edict to kill , no perverse lashing out against society with mass sexual assault . 
  that kind of difference - between 10-15 million latinos who will integrate ( in some sense ) into law abiding ( except for the obvious laws broken ) hard-working communities , and however many millions of people * not from a western culture * who often have no skill and no means of employment along with religious/sociological gripes , it 's pretty clear which lack of enforcement and borders produces the ( far ) worse case . 
  well , yeah . 
  the anglo-saxons are themselves a mix , and the country was dominated by the normans for a long time . 
   they go full on hitler so we should keep an eye on austria , too , eh ? 
  yeah , amsterdam 's not exactly a small town or something . 
  i 'm sure there are foreign persons committing crime , but i 'm not so sure if you transplanted several million people into a large city within the same country , you would n't have an elevated rate of crime because `` same country '' . 
  people are people . 
  there is no eu unless there are europeans . 
  unless there are a group of people who can say that they are europeans , and they can all agree on who are europeans and who are not and to whom and to what extent they have rights and obligations as europeans , there can not be political structures that justify themselves on the premise of benefiting europeans and existing because of the assent of europeans - let alone whether the common person who is such a ` european ' is benefitted or not . 
  this is n't an exercise in tautology ; for there to be an actual hug , there have to be two people hugging . 
  they have to embrace . 
  in disagreement , it is unwanted contact . 
  separate and they are grasping at air . 
  political union can not be forced because once it is forced it is not union , it is * dominion * . 
  domination instead of unity is never stable - it will always build resentment within whatever stability it provides and that will grow and grow and grow . 
  look at how * stunningly * similar an englishman is to a scotsman , to a welshman to an irishman . 
  compared to a frenchman or a german , they 're practically identical . 
  compared to an indian ( of any historical nomenclature ) , quite frankly , they * were * identical . 
  at one point , they were all indeed viewed ( at least by the governance of * one * set ) to be indisputably fit for `` union '' . 
  ireland is its own nation . 
  only recently were violent tensions from the era of the longbow and claymore through to the ar-18 and hand grenade put to rest between irish and english . 
  and then a motion for scottish independence . 
  and i believe lady diana even had to at least make a show of speaking in cymraeg . 
  their identities simply did n't stop existing , even to the point of violence . 
  union is stable , and prosperous because it is trust , it is each individual * wishing no longer * to be independent , but * connected * in union , to merge into one another . 
  the lovers ** ' ** embrace could not be more beautiful or more different from the rapist 's stranglehold . 
  until it 's abundantly clear and mutually in agreement to whomever are the `` europeans '' * whoever are * in fact , europeans , and abundantly clear what their mutual obligations and duties and rights and protections are , and that any narrower terms are not only irrelevant but * unwanted * as between a pair sorry to see the other leave , there will only be a european project , and not any kind of european union . 
  who is a european ? 
  are they someone whose land being taken by force and violence merits protection ? 
  are they someone whose economy and polity falling apart merits aid and restructuring ? 
  or are they only those who can be counted on to adopt the right kind of migrant policies and trade agreements ? 
  union or dominion ? 
  `` eh , it 's just crazy old grampa trying to get a rise out of people '' not the worst strategy they could employ . 
  a 26 year old woman who is committed to la\u00efcit\u00e9 dispels notions of patriarchal , reactionary , `` france is christian , drive the moozlims out ! '', 
  sentiment operating in the party , and as goes anti-semitism and sexual orientation ... am i wrong in remembering news coverage of jews and gays reportedly voting for fn ? 
  it seems like they 're squaring up not so much to reinvent themselves or rebrand themselves , but to make all concerns that are n't the concerns of muslim/foreign origin french/hard left french ones that are viably represented by the party because it 's future leadership will be more accommodating - like her , and not crazy old grampa at the dinner table . 
  the polish rating is absolute bullshit . 
  s&p dispensed with any kind of metrics and actually invoked poland not cooperating with the eu on the * migrant * issue as reason for a downgrade in credit . 
  fitch , for its part , looked at projected economic growth and said `` same aaa - , outlook stable '' and worried about pis only insofar as it made a lot of campaign promises that could tilt the budget deficit up if they keep all of them . 
  are finnish/estonian mutually intelligible in conversation ? 
  what about with hungarians ? 
  well , balls . 
  in all seriousness - i might have the opportunity to change jobs quite soon , but that will involve having about a month gap in between employment . 
  i * could * sit around at home - but i 'd love to travel !, 
  what would a proper two and a half weeks tour of ukraine be ? 
  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-germany-migrants-comment-b8928cd6-b4b5-11e5-8abc-d09392edc612-20160106-story.html she 's `` russian '' in this sense . 
   they 're handling it better than late 2014 though . . 
  i agree , mostly because the sanctions schedule the eu agrees to is n't nearly as harsh as the us wants . 
  no one is really willing to wage economic war on putin - and even though it 's reasonable to to wage * actual * war on him , what it means is that there 's essentially no western consequence for his actions in ukraine that are ones which will change his government 's behavior or make maintaining his behavior too costly to ignore for those whose support he relies on . 
  no ; there are several different ` americas ' within the us with different priorities and local cultures , despite political loyalty being towards the shared country as part of a super-culture . 
  up or down , what is important is for the sanctions to keep the ruble in flux with what are otherwise stable foreign currencies , particularly the dollar for petroleum purchasing . 
  this , more than an absolute devaluation of the ruble , is * really * what will hurt russia , because it will make long term russian debt instruments or property held in russia ` un ` valuable , so to speak . 
  that encourages capital flight , discourages foreign investment and debt purchase , and while it likely wo n't mean too much for the average consumer ( russians have a tolerance for consumer goods quality and availability changing or being worse far more than , say , britons ) , for the oligarchs , it means quite a lot - - enough that putin 's viability is put at risk hopefully . 
  except france 's debt to gdp ratio is 94 % ( gdp 2.8 t ) , and germany 's is 78 % ( gdp 3.7 t ) , and their public sector working profiles are * totally * different , in everything from percentage of the labor force to time off to * absenteeism * , to compensation .

  more .

  socialists . 
  oh , whatever . 
  the worst case scenario is the svr having a bunch of `` media liasons '' and non-profit workers and the like in positions of advisory capacity and intellectual life with the express purpose of influencing both private and public publications of editorials and general commentary to reflect the viewpoints of moscow . 
  that 's pretty mild ; everyone with a real intelligence service and money does that . 
  rt and al-jazeera are the open versions of doing it , stuff like anna `` chapman '' 's life from 2003ish to 2010 was the covert version of it , etc. 
  if there were some kind of pools for it , i 'd bet a million bucks i do n't have that western services have recruited academics at places like skolkovo to identify those russian nationals who will go on to occupy positions of academic power and military duty in research that can be made amenable to western interests without there * ever * being an explicit understanding that they are being used to promote a worldview that is n't exactly pro-russian . 
  every nation does this sort of stuff , and the line between `` foreign manipulation '' and `` native people coming to appreciate the merits of a foreign world view '' in an organic and ` legitimate ' way is really muddled . 
   you will but a fta is n't the same as being in the single market and you wont have as good terms as you have in the eu . 
  * solely * in terms of economic trade between the two trade areas . 
  if being a member of the eu ** only ** came with trade barrier reduction , the uk probably would n't give two shits about staying in and would n't ever be able to have nigel farage types . 
  nigel farage et al. 
  are as popular as they are because along with nicer trade terms , membership in the eu comes with substantial transnational policy making which the uk is n't too keen on . 
  if instead of marathi , gujurati , etc. 
  there was simple one kind of `` north indian language '' and instead of tamil , etc. 
  one kind of `` south indian language '' and there had been divergent cultural and political movements and states in `` india '' along those lines prior to the british dominion - - - i believe there would 've been a much different political landscape today , as it would n't have been a very united group inheriting the landmass in the late 1940s , and instead of just bangladesh splitting off from pakistan , and instead of just pakistan splitting for religious reasons , there might 've been a * yet another * great division of the subcontinent . 
   a shared religion is one contributor to culture , however , there are still vast cultural differences between most parts of india . 
  true , but there 's a * deep * culture that is operating behind all of them , which is the culture of the people of the indus river valley and then the gangetic plains , which - - actually a little bit like islam though in very different ways - - is pervasive in the basic assumptions and norms of life across the deccan . 
  this exists in the `` baltic '' nations , this exists in benelux , between the netherlands , germany , austria , and switzerland ( and lichtenstein and parts of belgium ) ; this exists among the irish , the welsh , the scots , and the english ; this exists among the portuguese and the spanish , among slavic peoples - - - there are distinct transnational cultural similarities operating at a very deep level , beneath language ( sometimes coincident with language ) and front-end political structure , which makes them much more similar to each other than to anyone else . 
  they are cultural [ clusters ] ( http://www.r-bloggers.com/data-science-short-lesson-on-cluster-analysis/ ) basically , and india simply happens to have a huge number of languages and people within one . 
  there are superficial similarities between people in terms of language between large parts of california and spain or chile , for instance , but it 's pretty clear that the * deeply * operant culture of an american who primarily speaks spanish in a mostly hispanic part of la is * still * much much better grouped in terms of political expectations and worldview with other people in north america , than a chilean or a continental european . 
  because if they get the right piece of paper , they can be given money . 
  and if they get the right piece of paper they can themselves give - votes !, 
  and if they get the right piece of paper then those from whom money has been taken , and those from whom votes had not been received - the migrants can replace them !,
