   i enjoy a good joke like everyone else but this kind of `` hur durr romania is so backwards '' is ridiculous . 
  oh , i 'm not trying to dump on romania ; you 're right , i was speaking without feeling . 
  i 'm just saying - - - it 's very likely that other countries are not only * vastly * overpaying for internet given romania 's costs , but given the imbalance in things like indoor toilets to internet , it 's likely that europe and n. america overpay for other utilities as well . 
  you 're right , i was speaking unfairly . 
  i am - and that 's why i can notice that india still has a deeply shared culture ( largely due to the vedic one , then the puranic one ) operating among many different languages . 
  and as telegana shows , among others , common languages are n't enough to guarantee cohesion , and different languages kind of ensure it . 
  if there were larger swathes of land in india that had historically spoken something like a ` super ' marathi/gujurati/hindi , etc type language all of their own , and one for the tamils/malayalam speakers , i can see there having been several movements like pakistan/bangladesh happening on the basis of language , not just religion . 
  europe 's common culture was never as pervasive and religious in character as existed in south asia 's deccan . 
  a close analogue , however , would have been the holy roman empire . 
  all of that sort of christendom has been dead since the end of the first world war . 
  another example would be the austro-hungarian empire : different languages and ethnicities and a unified polity . 
  however , it no longer exists either . 
  india too , from what had existed of a unified series of empires before foreign subjugation , eventually split into pakistan and bangladesh and sri lanka and india and afghanistan and nepal . 
  union is possible with similarity , and not a sure thing . 
  i think it is ruled out by salient and primary dissimilarity . 
  you know , everyone kind of gives them shit for that reality ... ... * but really * it should be a shame to the rest of us . 
  the romanian ~ ~ economy ca n't even afford real universal plumbing ~ ~ government sucks balls , sure - - - but if their internet is * so good * , then what 's * really * the lower tier utility ? 
  i 'd bet if you looked at things carefully , everyone else is overpaying for sanitation and water access too !, 
   who are the singaporean generals . 
  we can build a collective conscience outside of war . 
  we dont have to constantly think of war . 
  that 's why i started asking about what `` european '' architecture is . 
  what 's `` european '' food ? 
  what 's `` european '' architecture ? 
  i think there is very definitely something like italian food . 
  not so sure about `` european '' food . 
   how old are you ? 
  old enough to remember the times when we wanted to kill the germans ? 
  the european identity is constructed now . 
  how old are * you * ? 
  ** you claim there is a european identity - - but you speak to me in english knowing an american will likely not be fluent in french . 
  _ and what will you speak to a german ? _ his language ? 
  yours ? 
  mine ? 
  **  what is america ? 
  alabama or ny ? 
  this is the beauty of the us . 
  ** both ** there is a culture alabama has , which new york does not . 
  there is a culture in huntsville , alabama , with a nasa center and us munitions laboratory and arsenal , that does not exist anywhere in pickens county . 
  but you can take the most bucktoothed moonshine drunk racist derelict good ol' boy without any book learning past the eight grade , and you can set him down next to a slick haired , sharp suited , educated and refined manhattanite , and you can tell them both that the us has just been attacked at pearl harbor with thousands dead ** and you will invoke their identity as americans ** they might not even understand each other 's spoken english very well if they each go too quickly , use incompatible diction because of their education or lack of it - - - but they 're * americans * . 
  ______________ * nothing like that exists when you use ` european ' * there is no european identity that meant when russian federation troops attacked ukraine , it was an attack on all of europe . 
  ** what is it about ukrainians that means they are n't european ? 
  ** is it the paperworks they have n't signed on to ? 
  * because it if is only the fact that ukraine was n't a member of the formal political structure in paper that meant it was n't `` europeans '' being attacked * , then a formal political structure on paper is what it means to be a european . 
  not a language , not a culture , not a history , not a real peoples - - but a * legal document *  we 're constructing a european identity through our exchange programs for students ( erasmus ) . 
  maybe a million babies in total . 
  and what happens is mostly that someone has * two * passports , two kinds of food they eat , two languages they speak , and two sets of friends . 
  it does n't become true that an irish patriot and a proud spaniard girl have a children that are * ardent lovers of a european identity * - - instead you simply get generation after generation of people who are n't particularly rooted in any political loyalty . 
   symbols create slowly but they 're there . 
  we have a 15 old currency and will the uk and poland be adopting them anytime soon ? 
  the swedes ? 
  the romanians ? 
  they ** all ** know better ; whether they 're rich or poor , moving up or down in global significance , eu significance , they know better . 
  _________________________________________ ** until you are willing to see france and a french identity become no more meaningfully different to germany and a german one than alabama is to new york , there will not be a european identity that is possible - - and it still wo n't mean a european identity exists to take its place . 
  i think it 's great . 
  people should be proud of or at least more aware of their identities , even if it means that they find unity in a smaller group than they 're otherwise told . 
   we 've put the carriage in front of the horse . 
  the horse is n't one you can just get , though . 
  who is a `` european '' ? 
  what is `` european '' history ? 
  who are the `` european '' generals ? 
  where was the `` european '' nation founded ? 
  when ? 
  what is the `` european '' language , and what are some `` european '' customs ? 
  what does `` european '' architecture look like ? 
  what does `` european '' music sound like ? 
  there is no european culture , no european identity . 
  there is italian food . 
  there is german music . 
  there are english , british clothes . 
  `` europe '' in comparison to the us exists from november 1 , 1993 onwards , and it has ** no ** culture - - only expectations in common from the superficial similarities of 28 nations with disparate national identities and histories and ethnicities . 
  ** what frenchman would accept the destruction of his government and national sovereignty , along with the germans , so that germany and france would be only _ one _ country forever more ? 
  ** what language would they even speak to accept such a situation , and conduct affairs ? 
  if you ca n't do it for two , how can you do it for 28 ? 
  are bulgarians and macedonians keen on union ? 
  how about romanians and moldovans ? 
  speakers of the `` bosnian '' and `` serbian '' and `` croatian '' languages ? 
  if you told pennsylvanians and new yorkers that their states were to be combined by the federal government , there would be a lot of grumbling . 
  probably , some guns laws would change . 
  and , ahaha , probably some gun laws would go ignored . 
  probably , some taxes would be different . 
  there would be lawsuits and uniform changes and zoning issues . 
  but everyone would be doing this all in english , with the understanding that besides their narrow individual interests , their loyalty lay to * america * . 
  we effectively have an entire union now . 
  i do n't have to have any sort of national id card , there are no closed borders ; i just have to show i 'm legally driving a vehicle according to ** any of the 50 states ** and that i 'm willing to pay whatever toll there is to maintain a bridge or overpass , and i can go in between whatever damn states i want . 
  i 'm an american , and this is america . 
  what is europe ? 
  we 're totally amateurs compared to them . 
  our government ca n't even use propaganda to get people to support healthcare schemes when it should be the easiest thing in the world . 
   also it 's fully legal to own `` black powder weapon of separate loading ( bullet and black powder separatelly loaded ) produced before 1885 or copy ( replica ) of such '' . 
  they do that because the 1890s was when semi-automatic pistols started being used in the us and europe . 
  ancient technology !, 
   the cause and effect relation here is entirely non-obvious to me . 
  can it be that homogeneous culture in these places is the reason for higher socioeconomic status and wealth no , no , i 'm not saying either has anything to do with the other . 
  i 'm saying that people often throw out `` homogeneous ! '', 
  without thinking too much about what it means . 
  in the us , often racial homogeneity is a result of simply not having had more than one wave of immigration ( like the british descendants in new england basically still being there unchanged ) . 
  other times it is a result of deep socioeconomically damaging things - like centuries of slavery . 
  there are many places in the southeast of the us that are largely black ; but it 's not like they 've had generations of people going to school , getting jobs and building equity in property and wealth - many times they could n't even vote as recently as the 1960s , and there 's been plenty of discrimination on top of that well , well , past then . 
  so the `` homogeneity '' argument means very little to me .
