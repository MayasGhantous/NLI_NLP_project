  culture/socioeconomic status pretty much determine what someone thinks about committing a violent crime or property crime . 
  i think economic development * without * interference * does tend * to involve not having the ethnic balance disrupted , because of what that means generally for transportation and land occupation of other people competing for limited resources and political control , but , i do n't think the racial makeup is really part of * determining * development , more than culture . 
  yeah , you people just gassed entire families of them and had yet other families load them into ovens by the millions , rinsed and repeated . 
  do n't try to be sanctimonious about us policy towards jewish people circa 1930-1947 as a german , okay ? 
  arey yaar , the europeans are in for decades of identity politics like india struggles with . 
  i ca n't wait to see what the german analogue of congress party looks like . 
  maybe sweden will even have their own laloo prasad yadav !, 
  at the outset , let me clarify again , that new england 's overwhelmingly white and anglo ( and celtic ... ) population base is n't why it 's peaceful , despite being awash in firearms in several states like new hampshire , vermont and maine . 
  it 's peaceful because it 's wealthy and established and people have socioeconomic futures . 
  that happens to correlate with certain ethnic groups depending on whether or not they were enslaved for several centuries before the civil war , and capable of voting and going to school about a century after that . 
  the us is diverse , but inherent in that is that immigrant populations are n't * that * intermixed , and a lot of what people think of as `` normal '' diversity in the us did n't exist before 1965 ; certainly not before ww2 - it 's only since the last 50 years or so we 've had substantial non-european immigration . 
  while there was a lot of post-civil war internal movement ( and expansion westward ) and lots of immigration to places like nyc and chicago , there was never much '' 're '' settlement of several places in the us by immigration later or new economic developments . 
  new england , appalachia , the deep south , and the midwest have essentially stayed a variable mix of anglo-saxon/germanic for a long time , and have developed their own cultural peculiarities that have lasted a long time . 
  so , they are homogeneous ( though , they 'll be enclaves by the 2040s when whites are no longer a majority ) but that is n't why they can own guns and not hurt people . 
  they have little reason to hurt people because they 're socioeconomically well off , and their culture happens to be a hunting/frontier/colonial one that wrote civilian firearms ownership into its constitutional government . 
  look at what op is saying . 
  look at my comment where i saw vermont and nh only have * one * of the two things they 're talking about . 
  ah , maybe i should 've clarified : they do n't commit petty theft , violent crimes , and damage property . 
  there 's * plenty * of white collar crime in japan , too , and it 's run by organized criminal networks like the yakuza . 
  but japanese criminals are n't bored unemployed teenagers willing to blow someone 's brains out over an insult to their masculinity because they have pent up rage and nothing to do . 
  i personally believe this is the real reason hillary clinton ( then our secretary of state ) was so keen to keep private emails and wiped them all . 
  all the `` but people were killed at benghazi and she knew it was n't a youtube video but * turrists !, 
  * '' stuff is a sideshow , and hillary clinton was just part of an american-british-french-nato coalition that took the first chance ( maybe an engineered chance ) to respond to rebellion within libya to take out gadaffi and destroy his government . 
  was he a shitty guy ? 
  sure . 
  were there legitimate reasons for people to overthrow him ? 
  yeah , why not . 
  i 'd say the same about saddam - at least with that shit show there was the * pretense * of him developing wmd . 
  _____________________ were there core national security interests at stake for the us or other western governments in taking down libya ? 
  what about not going to war against them would put american lives at risk , i wonder ? 
  what reason for intervening would n't apply to north korea ? 
  or various african nations ? 
  or parts of * ukraine * ? 
  and if cooperating with gadaffi was out of the question : why bashir al-assad ? 
  what moral calculus is different ? 
  and if gaddafi had to be taken out ; what about when there are protests in kuwait , or qatar or saudi arabia that are brutally crushed ? 
  should the russians put up a ` no fly zone ' over them and deploy naval assets to the gulf and start bombing their armor and infantry and aid rebels ? 
  yeah , hft algos are going to take the downgrade into account and there will be plenty of activity that reflects a short term mathematical reality and not a longterm material one , for instance . 
  plenty of dumb money investors will get panicky over a credit downgrade by a large rating house , too . 
  nothing 's really changed about poland 's economic fundamental 's and fitch has reiterated poland 's credit status instead of downgrading them . 
  might wan na read what i wrote again . 
  it 's not even homogeneity of populations which they have either ; yeah , it 's true - - new england is mostly just white anglo people ( amazing , right ? ), 
  - - but their race has nothing to do with it . 
  the * same * absence of crime is found in plenty of `` minority '' majority areas in the us wherever socioeconomic prosperity and thus investment in the future of the community is found . 
  once people have money and property of their own , they basically * eschew any kind of criminality * . 
  when people do n't have any money or property ? 
  no future ? 
  well , turns out , they resort to the escapism of drugs and if you keep locking them up for decades on end and break their families and keep all of the men away from jobs , * shit goes wrong , fast , for a long time * no one ; not the establishment of the left or the right , really wants to talk about any of this stuff though , so guns get blamed ( esp . 
  by establishment left however ; they run the cities where this stuff goes the worst ), 
   my what ? 
  i have n't even stated my stance on the subject yet . 
  no , you 're just prancing around trying to conflate japan and poland 's reasons for being safe nations . 
  * but japan has the kind of society where if people did own guns en masse it would n't be an issue * vermont and new hampshire also have longstanding economic prosperity and widely enjoyed median income existences with little crime of all kinds , and very little firearms crime . 
  fewer than 15 murders in a single year - vermont only had two with a firearm ; the fewest in the entire country in 2010 . 
  they 're also two of the * least * regulated states . 
  in vermont , you can literally carry a loaded handgun around legally without any paperwork whatsover . 
  it 's not that they specified this in law , either , it 's that people do it because there are no laws banning it - it 's the defacto legal condition without any federal laws or state laws removing it as a right . 
  in fact , gun control in the us where permits were required to carry guns * largely * only came about after the end of the civil war , as a way for states to ensure black people could n't carry guns with ` may issue ' policies at the discretion of law enforcement . 
  ** culture ** not firearms access , determines whether people will commit murders , legal guns or not , gun murders or not . 
  plenty of places are just fine even with broad legal firearms access , because their cultures are fine . 
  ** fun fact ** new hampshire and vermont both have one of those two things are are the safest us states . 
  lexington , massachusetts [ today the public green looks like this ] ( http://www.planetware.com/photos-large/usma/united-states-massachusetts-lexington-battle-green.jpg ) [ and has this awesome statue ] ( http://www.parkasaurus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jan-apr-05-339.jpg ) of captain parker technically , in a political sense , there 's what 's now called [ independence hall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independence_hall ) in philadelphia where [ this happened ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/declaration_independence.jpg ) so that everyone could get to work on designing new flags to hang up , but it 's not nearly as cool . 
   minister of finance is calm and reasuring that everything is okay and s&p is wrong/mislead , but some other prominent party members are talking plainly about international leftist conspiracy that wants to destory our country because we 're so just and good . 
  ( at least they 're not talking openly about jews being behing it all ) yeah , i 'm not opposed to poland being an assertive nation where a polish identity is politically and socially conservative , deeply catholic , and racially/linguistically homogeneous like it is now ; i 'm none of those things , but i 'm also not polish in * any * sense , so i do n't mind so much if pis and some large portion of the electorate over there wants it that way . 
  to each their own . 
  but i can see how all of that going * way * too far could mean drastic economic changes . 
  this is true - - what i suspect of pis is that they 'll be willing to violate their own campaign promises later as well , and do what keeps the country 's economic fundamentals sound instead of really pursuing the politics they said they would . 
  a poland that is economically sound is going to be one that is more likely to reward their incumbents , even if it did n't come with the promised cash and prizes , than a poland that is economically wounded . 
  pole-land poleland poland we call 'em `` canadians '' , even though their country is n't ` canadia ' , because when you have to anglicize how french people mangled some indigenous language , you just make it ` easy ' to say . 
  `` calcutta '' is n't right , `` bombay '' is n't right , etc. 
  english just kinda wings it . 
   they do see risks coming from the way new government does things . 
  * potential * risks ; the economic fundamentals have n't changed . 
   just because they believe that current economic situation is still good does n't mean nothing is changed . 
  no , that 's really what they 're saying when they assign a rating to outlook . 
   of course now , with your post vastly exapnded , it shows that you take that into account . 
  sorry , yeah , once i read the fitch post in full , and went back to read the s&p rationale again , i just got so goddamn angry that s&p closed with some bullshit about the * migrant * issue and i went and typed more . 
  and fitch , pointing out that risk , does not believe it is sufficient to compromise economic fundamentals . 
  the statement you 're quoting comes directly from fitch 's statement on ** why ** they think poland has an a - rating with a * stable * outlook . 
  i think you should read my full comment a little more carefully . 
  fitch ( one year ago ) : `` hey , the economy looks alright !, 
  cool ! '', 
  fitch ( now ) : `` yeah , the economy has n't changed from before . '', 
  ... s&p ( one year ago ) : `` hey , the economy looks alright !, 
  cool ! '', 
  s&p ( now ) : * pis is bad and so that means that their credit is bad !, 
  '' * ________________ i 'm not being flippant : as says ** moody 's ** just a few months ago : [ ** moody 's on poland : politics unlikely to affect economic growth ( sept 30 , 2015 ) ** ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/poland-ratings-moodys-idusw8n11l01920150930 )  marco zaninelli told reporters that moody 's expects poland 's economy to grow by 3.5 percent in 2015 and 3.4 percent in 2016 and the impact of politics was unlikely to affect this performance . 
   `` i think the macroeconomic environment is strong enough to support volatility in the short term , '' zaninelli said . 
  `` a slower pace of reform would translate into a slower rate of convergence going forward . 
  but i do not see a direct impact on real growth . '', 
   zaninelli also said that the impact of the electoral cycle was already embedded in poland 's a2 rating , which has a stable outlook . 
  and ** fitch ? 
  ** [ ** fitch affirms poland at ` a - ' / ` a ' ; outlook stable ( february 6 , 2015 ) ** ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/idusfit91310620150206 )  fitch ratings has affirmed poland 's long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings ( idrs ) at ` a - ' and ` a ' respectively . 
  the issue ratings on poland 's senior unsecured foreign and local currency bonds are also affirmed at ` a - ' and ` a ' respectively . 
  the outlooks on the long-term idrs are stable . 
  the country ceiling is affirmed at ` aa - ' and the short-term foreign currency idr at ` f2 ' . 
   the ratings are supported by strong economic fundamentals , including a credible macroeconomic framework . 
  * membership to the eu * [ my interjection : not the flavor of the year of its political representation ] underpins political stability and institutional strength . 
   government debt ( 49 % of gdp in 2014 ) is in line with peers ' median ( 49 % ) and its fiscal deficit is narrowing . 
   in 2014 , real gdp grew 3.3 % , up from 1.7 % in 2013 , supported by domestic demand in the context of high job creation ( unemployment rate down at 8 % at end-2014 from 10 % a year ago ) , low inflation ( 0.1 % on average in 2014 ) and easing monetary policy .
