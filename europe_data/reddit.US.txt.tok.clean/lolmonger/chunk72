  fitch expects real gdp will continue to grow at around 3 % per year in 2015 and 2016 as domestic demand continues to expand , a new eu fund cycle ( eur105 .8 bn or 26 % of 2014 gdp ) for 2014-2020 starts and as european economies ( 75 % of exports , 25 % to germany ) gradually improve . 
  ** this is how you rate . 
  ** what does wage growth look like ? 
  what does export health look like ? 
  what is the projected monetary policy of the country ? 
  what credit demands does it have , and what kind of assistance can it expect to receive ? 
  if budget deficits are narrowing , is that happening with goverment debt * increasing * or staying the same ? 
  what 's the deficit reduction coming from ? 
  ** standard and poor 's ** also had this kind of analysis not so long ago : [ ** s&p changes poland 's credit rating outlook to positive ( february 6 , 2015 ) ** ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/poland-rating-sp-idusl6n0vg4d720150206 )  standard & poor 's revised the outlook on poland 's a - credit rating to positive from stable on friday , saying an upgrade could come if incomes continue to approach those in wealthier european union countries . 
  wage growth ; are the wages growing , and are the wages high ? 
  what does that mean for exports as opposed to domestic consumer demand ? 
  ** this is how you rate . 
  ** these are the kinds of questions , with hard numbers behind them that you ask . 
   it warned that the economic impacts of the crisis in ukraine and sluggish growth in the euro zone , or any drastic policy reversals in poland , * could put downward pressure on the ratings . 
  * reasonable !, 
  like if a government wants to have * high * spending relative to tax revenues possible from its people 's wage base , and increases budget deficits , meaning national debt to gdp ratio will worsen over time without significant wage growth or cuts in spending at some point - - for example . 
   `` the outlook revision reflects our expectation that income levels ... will rise consistently on the back of broad-based and balanced economic growth , thereby improving the economy 's resilience and capacity to bear debt , '' s&p said in a statement . 
  ^ huh , look at that , the same expectation which fitch * still * has for the economy . 
   s&p said it expected polish economic growth to slow to 3 percent this year before accelerating to an average 3.4 percent from 2016 . 
  * oh , look , there 's that + 3 % growth projection again * ________________ now let 's take a look at ** s&p 's current ** rationale : http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/15/sp-cuts-rating-on-polands-foreign-currency-rating-to-bbb-plus.html https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnx7a0eeelf0n2gkzymahesrqr6ihwtod2noxmn5pvu/pub  jan. 15 , 2016 , standard & poor 's ratings services lowered its long-term foreign currency sovereign credit rating on the republic of poland to ` bbb + ' from ` a - ' and its long - and short-term local currency sovereign credit ratings to ` a - / a-2 ' from ` a/a -1 ' . 
  the short-term foreign currency sovereign credit rating was affirmed at ` a-2 ' . 
  the outlook is negative . 
   the downgrade reflects our view that poland 's system of institutional checks and balances has been eroded significantly as the independence and effectiveness of key institutions , such as the constitutional court and public broadcasting , is being weakened by various legislative measures initiated since the october 2015 election . 
  poland 's new ruling party law and justice ( pis ) , which holds an absolute majority in the parliament ( sejm ) and the senate , has set out to make fundamental changes to poland 's institutions . 
  for example , the constitutional court 's ability to work efficiently and independently will likely be undermined , in our view , by changes to the court 's composition and decision-making process . 
  the government 's new media law , as another example , gives the government extensive powers to appoint and control the directors and supervisory boards of public broadcasters . 
  a third law terminates contracts of all current senior , career civil servants and removes a constraint regarding previous party membership , therefore enabling the new government to change the structure of the civil service . 
  so . . . . not wages . 
  not debt to gdp ratio , not budget deficits , not percentage economy growth over time . 
  not projected deficits , eu financial assistance , not the effect of wage caps absence or reinstitution . 
  not the effect of mortgage rate increases or the percentage of real-estate holdings in mortgage . 
  none of that * boring * ** number based stuff ** no , no :  a third law terminates contracts of all current senior , career civil servants and removes a constraint regarding previous party membership , therefore enabling the new government to change the structure of the civil service . 
  * that 's * what leads to a credit downgrade . 
  or maybe it 's even more sinister :  while pis ' absolute majority has removed pre-election concerns about increased political instability resulting from fragile coalition arrangements , we expect significant friction will persist between pis and the opposition . 
  in addition , we see a risk of internal tensions within pis between more conservative and moderate forces , especially given the growing public discontent about these new measures . 
  similarly , taxes on banks , insurers , and large retailers seem to be more focused on sectors that are predominantly foreign owned , thereby raising questions about poland 's attitude toward growth-driving foreign direct investment . 
  ** moreover , pronouncements about , for instance , the refugee crisis , may heighten tensions between poland and many western-european eu states . 
  ** waitaminute , s&p ... ... do you know something we do n't about what poland 's not cooperating with mutti on the migrant issue means for german diktat within the eu/ez/ecb ? 
  __________________________ contrast that with what ** fitch ** is still saying : [ ** 15 jan 2016 4:04 pm est - - fitch affirms poland at ` a - ' ; outlook stable ** ] ( https://www.fitchratings.com/site/fitch-home/pressrelease?id=997975 )  poland 's ` a - ' rating balances its strong macro performance , resilient banking system and governance indicators in line with the ` a ' rating category against high external debt , higher-than-peers ' government debt ( 52 % of gdp vs. 45 % for the ` a ' peers ' median ) and relatively low gdp per capita despite income convergence towards the european union ( eu ) average recently . 
  they 're still willing to talk about pis :  there are risks of a higher deficit : the pis government will be under popular pressure to deliver on its various promises ( e.g. 
  on income tax , the retirement age , or healthcare spending ) , while one-off revenues from the mobile auction will need to be replaced . 
  the pis government 's change in the stabilising expenditure rule facilitates increases in government spending in the short term and weakens the efficacy of the rule as an institutional anchor for fiscal policy . 
  here 's what ** fitch ** thinks could trigger a * negative outlook or downgrade * :  the stable outlook reflects fitch 's assessment that upside and downside risks to the rating are currently balanced . 
   nonetheless , the following risk factors could , individually or collectively , trigger negative rating action :  - relaxation of the fiscal stance that worsens the government debt trajectory . 
   - weakening of policy credibility or economic performance , for example due to deterioration in the business environment _______________________ ** do you see anything about pis not being nice to civil servants from a defeated political party or polish cooperation with ` western-eu governments ' on _ the migrant issue _ in there at all ? 
   no , the reason that assimilation has worked in the usa is because there was little or no forced language use . 
  know how i know you did n't go to a school in the us where you studied american immigration history ? 
   a lot has changed . 
  with the economic fundamentals s&p talked about , or a nebulous reading of a ` political situation ' ? 
  are wages projected to decrease , for instance ? 
    the downgrade reflects our view that poland 's system of institutional checks and balances has been eroded significantly as the independence and effectiveness of key institutions , such as the constitutional court and public broadcasting , is being weakened by various legislative measures initiated since the october 2015 election . 
  ( ... ) the government 's new media law , as another example , gives the government extensive powers to appoint and control the directors and supervisory boards of public broadcasters . 
  a third law terminates contracts of all current senior , career civil servants and removes a constraint regarding previous party membership , therefore enabling the new government to change the structure of the civil service . 
  ^ does that have * anything * to do with what s&p said the last time it * positively * rated polish credit ?

  none of which are necessarily linked to any of the factors s&p previously cited in their reasons for rating polish highly . 
   and if they get rejected ? 
  accept that the spooks/sf did n't think they were good enough ? 
  yeah , so about s&p : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-s-p-settlement-iduskbn0l71c120150203 ________________ and as goes moody 's and fitch ? 
  moody : http://www.reuters.com/article/poland-ratings-moodys-idusw8n11l01920150930 fitch : http://www.reuters.com/article/idusfit91310620150206 s&p was n't even bearish on poland before : http://www.reuters.com/article/poland-rating-sp-idusl6n0vg4d720150206 look in that analysis , and their current analysis - - is pis really transforming fundamentals of the polish economy ? 
  what makes you think ratings agencies are totally free from politics ? 
  this is n't isolated : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/former-british-army-soldiers-form-international-volunteer-force-to-fight-isis-in-syria-10111054.html http://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-veterans-return-to-iraq-to-fight-isis/ a * lot * of western militaries veterans , particularly us and uk troops , seem very keen on going to fight with the kurds they knew against isis . 
  it 's not like you can hate them for doing it , but why not try to join the intelligence services ? 
  or the special units of the military ? 
  they pretty obviously get sent to help the kurds out on state-sanctioned missions anyway . 
  it 's true that other languages were present - - our first native born american president was martin van buren - - and his * first * language was * dutch !, 
  * but we have always quickly assimilated our immigrants , always within a few generations , and never had them establish long term pan-ethnic , trans-national communities and identities . 
  this is * the opposite * case with the chicano , and now larger latino identity . 
  the national council of * la raza * comes to mind . 
  there were never long standing communities of * italian * illegal immigrants numbering in the millions and millions , speaking primarily italian with generational non-english acquisition , voting in a bloc on issues of amnesty . 
  we controlled our immigration - - we had long standing * prohibitions * on mass immigration , especially from places which were n't western european from our first immigration laws in the 1700s all the way until 1965 . 
   mmmmm ... you did have massive `` foreign presence of other language speakers '' . 
  before ww1 you had german language newspapers . 
  and in a few generations ( helped along by the war ) they assimilated , and the attitude of the whole country 's immigration system was as such : https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/haventohome/images/hh0077s.jpg we never had things like entire swathes of the nation speaking a foreign language commonly ( and occasionally primarily ) as we do now . 
   german is the most common ancestry for americans , not english , as many people expect and weirdly , while we here in the lands settled by franconians love our hunting , beer and pretzels and wurst , no one is pressing 2 for pennsilfaanisch-deitsch at the bank atm . 
  if the us would have a massive influx of immigrants again , i 'd * greatly * prefer they speak english , german ancestry or not . 
  i have no desire to see my country balkanized . 
  something tells me ` uneducated ' and ` lazy ' as characteristics of any individual would make any country not too keen on having a lot of them show up , jew or not . 
   english is not the official language of the united states we never had cause to legally designate it as that because we never had such a massive foreign presence of other language speakers to inspire the need to adopt that kind of law , like other european nations which were formally establishing ethnic and linguistic identities . 
  there are still welsh/irish monolingual speakers ? 
   auto corrected ` saying ' to samsung , wtf ? 
  on an lg ? 
  the conspiracy runs deep . 
   your not indian either that 's correct , i was born in the united states . 
  but , i am ethnically indian , and i find your assertion that i am a racist because i drew a distinction between the courts of the west and india to be amusing . 
   none of that defines what makes one indian you 're the one showing up here with cries of `` racism '' , so i pointed out the features of my race . 
  i 'm saying the italians should n't believe there is any particular animus against them by the indian courts ; it 's awful for indians , too . 
  the us has extensive problems with racism and corruption . 
  i would never deny that . 
  the notion that my own father could be assaulted for walking down a sidewalk in alabama , and paralyzed by cops , only to have them be acquitted appalls me . 
  i consider it a national shame . 
   its funny how all racist come to rescue each other . 
  at no point did i invoke race , and now that it 's relevant , i think you should realize ** i am indian in ethnic origin . 
  ** my skin is a beautiful chocolatey brown , the hymns i sing are in classical sanskrit , and my hair is jet black , thick , and i am swarthy with it . 
  i 've clearly touched a nerve , though . 
   nice danish google translate :-) i love it  it 's gotten way better in the last few years , and i can read much more news than before . 
   she probably wo n't be in office when the refugees start voting in big numbers ... that 's what the people of every country have to prevent ; either by refusing more importation of others and subsidization for their proliferation , or natalist/nativist policies - even if they are n't state sanctioned - to increase the birth rate of their own population . 
  it 's about voting .
