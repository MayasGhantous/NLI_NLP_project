   us immigration is mainly from mexico looking for work because there is work available though low paid . 
  sure , so were the gastarbeiters . 
  the * basic * mechanism is : `` life is materially better in this country , for whatever reason , so i will go there '' that 's it . 
  does n't matter if the reason is `` i can earn even an illegal wage in dollars and live and send some money back home !, 
  '' , or `` i can exploit the danish welfare system ! '', 
  the basic motivation is the same , moral character is irrelevant to the result - - they beat feet and come over by the millions . 
   european immigration is from places that make mexico look like new hampshire to be fair , the difference between a syrian coming to sweden and a honduran coming to new hampshire is large enough because of the difference between sweden and new hampshire . 
   pro immigration in europe is for humanitarian plus blind pc causes , not voting or cheap labour . 
  ** no , that 's exactly what it 's for ; do n't you see ? 
  ** the elites are telling us all the same things , all over the place . 
  that the migrants/refugees/illegal immigrants/h1b workers are a benefit to the economy , that we should be kind to them , that our societies are supposed to be multicultural , not monocultural , that we are dirty filthy racists if we want them to speak our respective languages and adopt our own cultures , that we are too lazy or too stupid to do the hard work they do or the skilled labor that they do , that we are unfeeling to the hardships in their homes , and that we exaggerate the ones we face in * our * homes . 
  india 's legal system is a * nightmare * for indians , too . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-08/indias-courts-resist-reform-backlog-at-314-million-cases you think foreign nationals have it bad ? 
  the federal system of the indian republic centralizes power which is then administered by its arms of the executive and judiciary in each state . 
  the legislatures of those states are effectively functionaries of the national government , and * there * is where the power lies . 
  massive incumbency , * massive * nepotism . 
  only very recently was there a legislative shakeup with the new prime minister 's party and they * still * can not effect any kind of actual change in the country 's long standing corruption . 
  any society with a space program like india 's is clearly one * capable * of sophistication , great works , and manifested talent . 
  ___________________________________ any society which has n't even guaranteed people wo n't be sexually assaulted when they go out in a field to relieve themselves for want of toilets at the very same time they launch spacecraft , is * obviously * totally endemically corrupt , and extracting massive wealth from its people to a small few . 
   it 's extremely hard to do that with high levels of taxation . 
  i agree . 
  do what the ` others ' in my country and europe do . 
  use the system - apply for benefits , use the tax laws , have friends and family as part of your support network ( never financial , always logistical ) . 
   the domestic western population is literally being taxed to pay for immigrants to have children instead of ourselves , it 's complete madness . 
  there are * yet * still more `` westerners '' ( which , as an american of more foreign extraction than the anglo-saxon , i think is determined not by race but by ideology and action ) than non-western people . 
  time to get busy and * use * those massive systems of tax and benefit , eh ? 
   if we would be allowed to keep more of our own money we would be able to have more children and spend more time with those children . 
  do it anyways !, 
  have more children and spend more time with them * anyways * . 
  maybe it means you wo n't buy a new computer , phone , or tablet in the next five years . 
  maybe it means you 'll live in a home with one or two fewer rooms than you have people in your family , and a younger brother will have to learn just how greatly the older brother can take the blanket for himself - i sure as hell did . 
  maybe it means the younger brother will have handmedown clothing - i sure as hell did , long after i no longer coveted the ` cooler ' clothes of my older brothers . 
  maybe that will happen . 
  * but it will mean a west that is n't barren and being replaced *, 
  how is it completely unrelated ? 
  europeans who feel this way silently can do * one * thing to undo it all . 
  ** have more children ** make your children the priority , have lots of them , do everything to have several - like three or four , and support them . 
  without this , in less than a century , various european cultures will be diminished because there will be very few vessels of them . 
  neoliberal globalist publication . 
  they think markets can make the whole world function like a single polity singing kumbaya and electing pluralist secular governments . 
  i love seeing how anxious these types get over china 's continued non-acceptance of western ideology , despite becoming materially a more modern and powerful nation , and isis being the new flavor of the month for centuries long ` radical ' islamic sentiment . 
  eventually they 'll figure out that their values were n't accidental , are n't universals , and are n't inevitables , either . 
  until then , they 'll say shit like : `` let 's * insist * the refugees respect women like * we * def do , totes for realz '' and be so satisfied they cut that gordian knot . 
  if there 's anything the similarities of the eu 's migration system ( legal and otherwise ) and the us 's migration system ( legal and otherwise ) has taught me , it 's that right wing and left wing elites will do everything they can to get cheap labor and new voting blocs , and no one gives a fuck about poor white people . 
   `` austrian '' was n't considered an ethnicity distinct from `` german '' . 
  and i would n't consider it a distinct ethnicity * today * . 
  i would n't have ever considered it such because of what 's clearly the same genetic and linguistic clustering . 
  all i 'm saying is that to say hitler was ` german ' and could n't be considered ` austrian ' denies that an ` austrian ' political identity which was not german , in several forms , existed before hitler , when he was born , and after hitler . 
   indo-european is really a misplaced term here . 
  just pointing out that austro-hungary was an example of a state wherein the ethnolinguistic identity was n't uniform within the state , because it was n't entirely german/ie , nor hungarian/uralic . 
   before ww2 austrians were considered germans . 
  particularly because of the anschluss . . 
  if you 're going to go back much further , then you get into the tricky business of what `` germany '' is compared to the osterreich compared to simply land with `` germans '' on it . 
  are bohemians as they were germans ? 
  still germany or not germany ? 
  hitler * was * a german in all the ways that matter as far as being a leader of the german nazi state and considering himself `` german '' in heritage and character , but he was born in austria , formerly the austro-hungarian empire ( which was n't even entirely * indoeuropean * let alone ` germanic ' in character ) . 
   the idea that austrians are n't germans is a very recent one so that 's really just not true . 
  there 's * a lot * of history in that area of the notion of an ` austria ' , which is not ` germany ' . 
  the discussion on / r/atheism has a top comment : ____________________________ 'm a native icelandic speaker , and that headline is really misleading to the point of being maliciously misleading . 
  i commented on this on / r/iceland yesterday , this does n't take away from the general trend of the poll which do show that there 's an accelerating generational divide in iceland when it comes to religion with older people being much more religious than younger people . 
  but the question asked in the poll was confusing . 
  it was `` how do you think the universe came to be ? '', 
  and the answers were `` the universe came to be in the big bang '' and `` god created the universe '' or `` do n't know '' and `` other '' . 
  now , what many outside of iceland and i 'd say especially americans need to understand is that even christians in iceland and for that matter in most of europe do n't literally believe in the origin story in the bible in in anything but trivial numbers . 
  maintaining the literal interpretation of that is very much an american evangelical thing . 
  i bet if you polled priests in iceland and asked them whether they thought the big bang happened you 'd get a 100 % response rate in the affirmative . 
  but many people believe that god is the root cause of the big bang , and the comments in the `` other '' section of the poll ( page 14 ) are overwhelmingly about something to that effect , e.g. 
  `` god created the world in the big bang '' . 
  so yes , icelanders are getting less religious , but this `` 0.0 % '' number of under 25 year olds thinking god created the world does n't mean they 're all atheist , this same poll shows that 42 % of those same people consider `` i 'm a christian '' to be the most accurate description of their religious views . 
  ________________ so , more likely : older people are more religious , younger people are * waaaaay * less religious , but not less religious in the sense that there are officially 0.0 % of people under the age of 25 who rule out entirely the notion of the world as we know it having been created by ` god ' . 
  several clusterfucks , over several centuries , where people were rebelling against edicts from london with swords and pikes , and eventually shoulder fired missiles and assault rifles . 
   but they are not refugees , they are migrants posing as refugees . 
  `` foreign peoples who are brown and from another culture '' - i alluded to western attitudes of the left wing ( as well as the right wing ) leading to * this * really being the mental category of even high minded policy makers . 
  in the us , we see them conflate immigrants like the bengali . net developers with border jumping mexicans performing illegal agricultural labor - - they 're all `` immigrants '' and if you take a position against h1b wage distortion or amnesty , for whatever reason , you 're * anti-immigrant * and a traitor to america 's founding narrative . 
  so they say . 
  in europe , the same is done with :  migrants posing as refugees by the powers among the left , wherein all of the dusky and alien looking peoples ( wearing jeans and football club track jackets holding smartphones ) are certainly * refugees * no matter their behavior , no matter their economic incentives borne out in their destination choice . 
  i am indicting * both * right and left wing responses to this crisis , because i see them both borne out of an exoticism , a neo-orientalism that denies the basic humanity of brown people ; on the right , by refusing to accept legitimate cause and effect of centuries of their nation 's intervention including in recent times , and on the left , by refusing to accept legitimate complaints about the * unacceptable * behavior of people who should be behaving like people , and not excused to do so as though they 're lesser animals . 
  same thing in the us - except for our massive foreign immigration ( legal and otherwise ) after 1965 and then 1986 , especially from latin america . 
  for us , it will be a little more obvious because we 'll go from a `` white '' ( even when we anthropologically changed what that meant to just be skin color ) nation to a decidedly `` minority-majority '' one - and in the west and south west , a latino majority nation . 
  countries like germany will simply have a sub 50 million ( maybe less ) cohort of ` german ' germans , and in a century ? 
  two centuries ? 
  who knows . 
  the baby boomers were never going to be a demographically * normal * trend , but following the sexual revolution and the work revolution of women ( via the pill , and greater career participation ) , along with the normalization of abortion in the western world , and ` no-fault ' style divorce laws : marrying young , starting a family , and doing the work of building wealth and hearth is simply * abnormal and undesirable * . 
  you ca n't have `` fun '' in the way it is prescribed by consumer culture to have fun from 18-35 if you get married in your early 20s and have a kid or two by the end of your 20s . 
  even if you kept technological and social changes around how the west does sex and pregnancy the same , practically speaking , you simply could n't have that many partners , or responsibly raise kids , if you were getting married and living in a single home and not travelling for what is now a effectively ubiquitous `` away from home , but not in the workforce '' experience of university . 
  this is particularly acute for women ; men have * long * been ` away ' to undergo whatever kind of social ritual or trial of necessity that their culture tells them to do before they 're worthy . 
  whether it 's a rumspringa or a bramhachari 's pilgramage , the spartan 's making certain youth leave their agoge to slaughter insurrectionist helots during crypteia , american boy scouts learning how to tie knots and lifeguard , going to fight a war , toiling in the fields etc. 
  male roles have always been those of ` outside doership ' ; outside the home , outside the country . 
  female roles have always been ` inside doership ' ; in the home , in the country . 
  the west for better or worse ( i think both in a lot of different areas ) has impartially , by technological and social means , broken a lot of this down , intentionally and unintentionally . 
  this was all not so much a problem for a long time , but it * is now * because demographic realities that do n't care about bottom lines just as evolutionary ones do n't care about social change ( their timescale is so much longer ! ), 
  are starting to bite governments in the ass . 
  what happens when your proportion of retirees to workers goes from 8 to 1 to * 3 * to one ? 
  what happens when all the older people are working longer because their kids are in school ( for programs of study which are dubiously fit to job demands , though socially , unavoidable ) for longer ? 
  when they do n't retire and there are simply fewer * advancement * slots for current middle management , and thus - outside of profit/loss - way less incentive for hiring ? 
  what happens when your nation 's once easy flow of credit in consumer markets contracts , not only because younger people earn less , but there are just * absolutely fewer people to spend money ? 
  * what happens when your workforce is almost entirely lettered and none of them want to do manual labor ? 
  what happens when almost all young women regard the idea of staying at home raising multiple children as a * prison * , a physical and * moral * prison ? 
  what happens ? 
  do you import immigrants ?
