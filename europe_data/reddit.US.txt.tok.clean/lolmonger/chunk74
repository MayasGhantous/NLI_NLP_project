  hope your bien-pensant friends in the news media make sure to say `` immigrants '' and `` migrants '' and `` refugees '' are all the same and everyone should be okay with them because they 'll all integrate perfectly and add to the labor force , not the welfare rolls , and yet also displace no natives from either ? 
  what to do ? 
  what to do ? 
  _________________ no one really knows what to do , and i suspect it is * this * topic , this ugly , thorny , knotted and undulating problem involving everything from when and why and with whom people have sex , and get married and reproduce ( now three distinct things ) , to how many people rent vs buy , to whether young people are studying ` the right things ' , etc. 
  that gets obsessed about in heady meetings at davos . 
  and i do n't think the elites have any answer for the world they 've made . 
  `` dick '' as a slang-rhymy sort of name for someone named `` richard '' ( shortened to rick ; rick -  dick , kind of like `` robert '' -  bob , and a much , much lesser used `` hob '' ) existed for a long , long time before it became slang for penis . 
  i think `` richard '' has itself stuck around for so long as a name that it has more staying power than the diminutive 's being a name for a penis would to displace it . 
  * that * , or there 's an unspoken running joke among anglophone parents to keep giving everyone the opportunity to make dick jokes . 
   same as `` understand '' = `` stand under '' . 
  wtf english language ?

  i 'm sure there 's much the same going on in other indo-european languages , polish included . 
   you think a european military wo n't ever happen ? 
  requires a unified european civilian government with the decisiveness to have a unified command and control structure . 
  so , think about what was required for there not to be english , scottish , welsh and irish ( well lol , northern irish ) armies , but a united kingdom 's * british army * . 
  think about that , and think about what would be required for their to be an uk-france army . 
  just the uk and france , having a common army . 
  okay , now look at how many other members of the eu there are . 
  okay , now look * back * at all the shit that happened * after * the first manifestation of the `` uk '' had an army . 
  alright , now think about how that goes when you have all of the eu trying to have an act of union . 
  __________ do you see how a `` european '' military is kind of tough to realistically do ? 
   this is why the naive attempts to enlighten immigrants ( explaining to them that our sexual mores are different , that a woman who walks in public in a mini skirt and smiles does not thereby signal sexual invitation , etc. ), 
  are examples of breath-taking stupidity -- they know this and that 's why they are doing it . 
  they are well aware that what they are doing is foreign to our predominant culture , but they are doing it precisely to wound our sensitivities . 
  the very same western arrogance that leads the conservative to be outraged at the assertiveness and lack of gratefulness among refugees - - not the rapey/criminal ones , i mean the ones that look at something like american and european warplanes wrecking their governments and infrastructure and think they should get out - - * also * leads to the liberal to be utterly convinced that there is some kind of neo-white man 's burden that 's * really * moral martyrdom if they do whatever they can to never hurt the feelings of even badly acting refugees . 
  * they 're just people . 
  * all of them are * just people * - - and it 's ignorance of this that leads to the right-winger looking down ' horrible savages ' , coming to their shores in droves , to * sneer * at brutalized people who just want to live , and the left-winger looking down at ` poor savages ' , coming to their shores in droves , to * ignore * criminal people who just want to break shit . 
  both the ultra-nationalist who can not understand that shrapnel and hunger make foreign people want to gtfo of a war torn country if they can , and the perpetually guilt ridden liberal who can not understand that not everyone with fair skin has a debt to a random syrian are * totally denying the agency and humanity of the refugees * . 
  both of them turn people who are * just people , no more , no less * , in to ` the darkies ' , who are either awful darkies coming to ravage our fair white virgin maidens and ruin our lineage and land , or wretched darkies who maybe should get some rounded plastic toy shovels and cellphones they can safely teeth while we figure out how to teach them to read and civilize them . 
  the conservative manifestation of this western-centric view is to * demand * lowliness and gratefulness and subservience and * meekness * from * people , who are just people * , whose nations have been colonized , imperially abused , butchered by western warfare and puppet governments for generations . 
  the liberal manifestation of the same sickness is to * excuse * criminality and entitlement and unlawfulness and * bigotry * from people * who are just people * , who have cellphones , grew up consuming western culture , and who know precisely what rape and sexual abuse are and purposefully do it to seek ` revenge ' . 
  ____________________________________ both are fundamentally a desire to be ` more ' than those who are ` lesser ' . 
  both are fundamentally a denial of the fact that these are just * people * . 
  i find the left-wing 's sickness marginally a bit worse at the moment , because so far the right-wing has n't gone full-hitler , and the right-wing at least does n't pretend ( they 'll get there though , once they start casting themselves as the sexual guardians of western women 's purity , via hostility towards the dark men ) as much as the left that they 're super-duper-morally-unquestionable-righteous folk . 
  furthermore , the left 's utter stupidity is now putting at risk not just the safety of the refugees and the conflict zones they come from by making solutions to these problems more and more intractable , but also the cohesion of the eu itself , the eu , being one half of what is essentially ` the west ' . 
  at least , for now , the right-wing which does n't have the benefit of academia , younger people 's loyalty , and neo-liberal newsmedia , is n't * quite * in the same position of institutional power to fuck shit up . 
   the head of the district is named dreier - which could also mean threesome is it like how in english if someone 's name is `` dick '' , no one really thinks about how their name is slang for penis , but once they do it 's * the only way * you can think about their name for a little while ? 
  oh , the polity with the largest national economy and defense apparatus on the planet which fought two world wars and then jockeyed for supremacy against a nuclear armed hostile power over the fate of europe found common cause with the governments of those nations similar in culture and political tradition ... in establishing a stable political and financial union among them which would likely obviate future martial and economic and political strife ? 
  * astounding * who could 've * ever * expected that ? 
  and it anticipated the need to adapt to changes in those circumstances ?!, 
  * how staggeringly unexpected * boy , it 's like those decades worth of adults in government and the military in the us and europe - - it 's like they dedicate time and effort to this or something !, 
   what he did was not a crime . 
  so , i 'll admit i 'm not * totally up * on what sexual predation and child endangerment laws are in india * or * the united states , but i 'm just gon na go out on a limb here , and say that even if telling your grandniece to strip nude and sleep in bed with you in order to ` test ' your ability to remain sexually abstinent ( what if you fail ? ), 
  is n't statutorily illegal , , it 's still * super fucking weird and wrong * . 
   what does you being a hindu have to do with anything here ? 
  gandhi 's justification for doing this shit invoked hindu sexual mores about abstinence . 
   if he did not act on his urges , what is the problem here ? 
  ... you still think there 's no issue with what he did , huh ? 
  i mean , incest inclined pedophiles who require their minor relatives to sleep naked with them are bad people to me , yeah . 
  i feel pretty comfortable in saying that is `` bad '' . 
  i can recognize that gandhi was an amazing political leader , and still think of him , as a person , outside the context of a nation 's independence struggle , as being fucking weird for having his grandniece sleep naked with him . 
  oh for fuck 's sake , do you think we 'd roll the fuck over if there was a unsc ' * review ' of the us that was clearly russia and china stirring shit ? 
  okay , and if they review it and those national government powers within the eu who have power to change eu policy decide they do n't much like what they see happening in poland , then what happens do you think ? 
  as a hindu myself , it 's pretty fucking clear he was a sexual pervert and * seems very likely * he was a pedophile with incestuous urges who simply did n't act on them . 
  hardly exonerates him . 
  he * is * a former head of state . 
  i think it 's probably okay for him to invoke a collective sense of the french identity . 
   did n't the french officially surrender to the nazis ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vichy_france#fall_of_france_and_establishment_of_the_vichy_government depends on how legitimate you think france 's surrender and collaborating government was . 
  and it 's legally impossible to change those laws ? 
   well the whole point of human rights is that they are general and for everyone . 
  what about women being sexually abused ? 
  they count less than people who have asylum sexually abusing them ? 
   yes , but you also have the issue that it simply is impossible to deport someone where his life is in danger or he is in dnager of being tortured no matter how big an arsehole he is it 's not impossible . 
  bringing people back from the dead , or levitating through will power is impossible . 
  also :  no matter how big an arsehole he is is a foreign national who has sought asylum for whatever reason in a country that is not his own , should he commit sexual abuses , for instance , still merit asylum ? 
  and unless other french papers are totally fabricating sources and statements about this being something the french authorities are willing to indicate could be voluntary manslaughter and are furthermore keeping an open mind about it being not just a burglary gone wrong , but also an anti-semitic attack - - - i mean , i just do n't see what exactly anyone is trying to suggest about op 's motives , op 's source text , or op 's link title , being `` misleading '' as though there * is * something this news article should lead us to believe , and anything it * should not * lead us to believe - - but is as a result of what op has posted . 
  there will be an autopsy for sure , but i do n't think his family members are exaggerating or something ; one of their relatives is dead . 
  why would they start making shit up ? 
   i 've yet to meet a person that would go shooting as a hobby . 
  `` i do n't know anyone who does this ! '', 
  `` there is no tradition of gun ownership . '', 
   guns in connection with hunting and shooting clubs are a hobby with a long tradition in europe yes , this is * exactly * why i wrote :  even if there was n't an established culture of firearms ownership like in parts of the cz rep. or firearms as part of a citizen-duty like in switzerland , or firearms as a normal part of the cultural landscape like in the us . 
  contrasting the difference between what exists in czech rep. , switzerland , and the us as three very different kinds of firearms owning norms . 
  good thing you decided to go the :  bunch of gun adoring rednecks - discussion-route like the sophisticated and nuanced person you are . 
   also , what does this have to do with austria ? 
  i 'm assuming a similar culture and similar reaction to the immigration crisis between austrian people and german people . 
  maybe that 's a little too small minded . 
  are you aware of what their laws are ? 
  http://www.zbrojniprukazy.cz/postup-ziskani-zbrojniho-prukazu/ there are like , five shooting ranges next to each other in the middle of prague . 
  people * go * to them , not just tourists . 
  there 's a healthy domestic arms industry that sells to civilians . 
  you can even legally carry firearms on one 's person . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_politics_in_the_czech_republic#obtaining_a_license_by_a_foreigner you do n't even need to be a czech to have the same firearms privileges . 
  _________ cz rep is ** way ** better for gun owners in practical terms , even though firearms ownership is not a constitutional right , than many states and jurisdictions in the us, 
   idealists are dangerous now ? 
  naivete can be dangerous , yes . 
  idealism without pragmatism is naive . 
   and how do you want to deal with these dangerous people ? 
  not let them win elections . 
   states tend to silence them , imprison them , or execute them #oh , i 'm so glad that the left wing and its sympathizers do n't resort to shrieking cries of tyranny when people disagree . 
  that would be tedious . 
  just call everyone who is n't down with a federalized europe with open border to the third world ` hitler ' . 
  you want to , just go for it . 
   are up over 900 % since july betcha before july there were hardly any to begin with . 
  there 's no doubt in my mind that probably , a decent number of german language speaking people are more interested in the prospect of arming themselves , even though firearms laws are relatively restricted in countries where german speaking people primarily live . 
  http://www.smh.com.au/world/migrant-crisis/migrant-crisis-gun-sales-in-austria-surge-amid-fears-of-refugee-crime-20151027-gkkdus.html more austrians , and more women in particular , have been buying firearms , for instance - clearly in response to the refugee crises , even if there was n't an established culture of firearms ownership like in parts of the cz rep. or firearms as part of a citizen-duty like in switzerland , or firearms as a normal part of the cultural landscape like in the us . 
  but it 's hardly as though you can look at this and conclude that there 's been some complete and fundamental change on the part of german societies towards self armament and * complete * cynicism towards their government 's ability to protect them . 
  that will be demonstrated at the voting booths , before it happens on the firearms license applications forms .
