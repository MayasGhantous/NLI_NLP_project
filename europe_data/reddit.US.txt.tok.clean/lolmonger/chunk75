   so would russians accept it for the return of crimea and preservation of the russian state . 
  it needs to be an untenable political proposition for the `` preservation of the * russian * state '' to include `` the return of crimea '' - - crimea is part of ukraine . 
  a russian polity that thinks it 's okay to annex parts of other sovereign countries by force because of the ethnicity of people living there is not one which should be a tolerated business partner . 
   well , instead of advocating for measures that will most likely harm innocent people it would harm fewer innocent people than going to war with russia , even if implemented in full . 
   why do n't you come visit your congressman and launch a petition aimed at our corrupted officials who own a whole bunch of real estate in miami ? 
  my representatives in the congress , either house and senate , have little to do with that kind of policy making , as i 'm not a floridian . 
  i * do * however , make it a donation/voting priority to see that foreign nationals from russia and china can not abuse us real estate markets by turning our cities into investment properties and wealth stashes like happens in london and vancouver . 
  housing is expensive , and i think housing in america should be for americans . 
   oops , sorry , i forgot that the glorious us of a can not lift a finger against the rich . 
  that would be against your very principles of society . 
  yes , that 's why we re-elected someone like obama who says ` when you spread the wealth around it 's good for everybody ' and have people like bernie sanders occupying national attention . 
  maybe if we had amy goodman or another liberal journalist murdered in her home like anna politkovskaya , or edward snowden murdered like litvinenko , i would accept the accusation of moral parity between the societies of the united states and russia . 
  ... however , as you 're typing in fluent idiomatic english on a foreign content aggregator website , and have a posting history that suggests education and foreign travel , i can pretty * safely * assume you 're part of the ` westernized ' and slightly more liberal sector of russian society . 
  you 're not one of the people okay with stalin 's image being rehabilitated , you 're not one of the people okay with russia 's anti-gay laws , you 're not one of the people okay with the war against ukraine on the grounds of protecting ethnic russians . 
  you 're part of what could be part of the future of russia , one where it is more prosperous , less antagonistic , and not oriented in war footing against western overtures . 
  we do n't need to make this a dick measuring contest . 
  you know , as well as i , that putin and whoever he tries making his successor ( if he succeeds in asserting * that * level of control when he 's too old to lead himself ) , is unhealthy for russia in a way obama is n't or even bush was n't for the us . 
  when i say : `` let 's make it impossible for the average russian to buy medicine or food that is n't made in russia and grind down their hopes and ambitions to punish them for allowing putin to stay in office '' that it 's not going to be implemented for precisely the reason you offered : what happens to the west 's diplomacy if people like * you * who are potentially the future of the country , die because they ca n't get german made medicine ? 
  my proposal is there * simply to demonstrate * how devastating simply no longer cooperating with putin could be - - without firing a shot . 
  i think it would take far less pressure than what i 'm suggesting , and only a little more than what the eu is currently willing to apply , to produce a putin who is willing to let go of crimea , and let go of donbass . 
   but an american saying that aggressive foreign policy is abomination and must be punished ? 
  are you masochistic ? 
  as it turns out , lots of us do n't like at all what bush and obama have done with our military . 
  ** furthermore ** no one believes the us is trying to annex iraq . 
  to turn pakistan into a us territory . 
  what the current russian government is trying to do is forever have the outlying lands around the russian federation be effectively * part of russian * that is wholly different from any modern nation 's conduct - whether france striking mali , or the us drone strikes in pakistan . 
  one is ( though i say again , largely misguided , with high civilian death counts ) strikes often done by consensus against a threat to security or peace ( * dubious * as that often is ) . 
  there 's an argument to be made for drone strikes against isis . 
  there 's an argument to be made for french troops fighting in mali . 
  * for russian troops to annex crimea ? 
  * it 's purely russia attempting to assert control over land it views as belonging to russia . 
  it would be the like us invading and annexing parts of canada if a government became unfriendly to our interests there , but did n't have any designs towards us . 
  is prohibiting trade with north korea tyranny ? 
  are trade sanctions * tyranny * ? 
  because there are already trade sanctions going both way . 
  is putin being tyrannical in addition to his wartime actions ... with respect to eu food imports ? 
  is that really * tyranny * ? 
  i 'm not an average american , i 'm much more right wing than most , and what i 'm proposing is illustrative of how severe economic consequences can be , and why military escalation is so stupid . 
  it would never be adopted . 
  i also have a decent amount of fondness for russia because of relationships i 've had coincidentally being with people from there . 
  i also do n't want you to die . 
  i do want putin to be forced to change , and i do think that should happen by the west exerting as much economic leverage against his government via your nation 's economic links with the west as possible . 
  it sounds extreme , sure . 
  is it more extreme than murdering and displacing thousands of people ? 
  that 's what putin did . 
  should we continue to do business with his government ? 
  should his polity continue to interact with ours ? 
  there are lines - the united kingdom does n't have booming trade with north korea ** precisely ** because the uk , and basically everyone else take the position that it is a moral impossibility to do so because of the actions of the kim regime , even though it essentially contributes to the misery of n. korea as a whole . 
  i think russia 's actions in crimea and the donbass were unbelievably low class for a modern nation . 
  why should the west tolerate it ? 
  the eu ? 
  why should russian importers get eu manufactured clothing ? 
  why should their pharmacies be able to offer eu origin medicines ? 
  whatever the moral line is , i think it should be much higher than it is now , and consequences more severe if we wish to force putin to withdraw troops , rather than weaken his own base of power . 
   it literally would n't have happened if she had n't imported over all these immigrants . 
  ** the cologne attacks ** would n't have happened without the importation of the cologne attackers . 
  ** this shit ** would n't have happened if somewhere around 250 right wing extremists were n't cunts . 
  this is n't the fault of any migrants , or merkel . 
  if the police do n't come down on this hard , they 'll only do it again . 
  they 'll see the lack of a strong and unified response condemning them and taking action as tacit approval . 
  more military security should n't involve increased nato obligations mixed up with eu politics . 
   you do realize poland does not even have half the population of germany ? 
  and its population is also declining . 
  sounds like a good reason to invest in natalist policies . 
  i do n't think any war is imminent . 
  i believe poland would be better off developing its economy and international economic ties to the point it has a gdp like germany 's , and yet retains a nationalist , assertive political identity - - and gets a military of its own to match . 
  there 's no reason they should be tied to america 's or the eu 's interests where they contradict polish ones , and more nato ( us ) presence means more obligation to nato ( the us ) . 
  this strategy seems like it 's putting the cart a little bit before the horse . 
  lol what ? 
  nothing i 'm saying advocates any kind of militaristic strategy . 
  do n't let the mugger out from the streets into your shopping mall , until he cleans up his act , is all i 'm saying . 
   it will take at least the two post-war generations to die they 're not even being born . 
  which is still stupid . 
  * europe * should be the counterbalance to american hegemony . 
  the eu should be the political and military apparatus that europeans look toward , which does n't cooperate with the us when it wants to go on a nato misadventure and tells us we 're on our own . 
  whenever my liberal friends do n't get it , i ask them if they 've heard of `` here comes honey boo-boo ! '', 
  the whole world has , sadly , at this point . 
  then i ask them if they think such a show could be made about a black family . 
  or a mexican one . 
  poor white people are the scum that everyone gets to hate in america , because of classicism and retribution based racism , and i do n't blame them one iota for supporting trump . 
   hell i think like 90 % of the houses around here are built by illegal immigrants . 
  * so , you get how this is a problem for american workers who want american wages , right ? 
  *  the difference here being that they try to integrate . 
  do you think people were pressing two for spanish before 1986 ? 
  which means it 's time to ratchet up sanctions . 
  the one thing putin is paranoid about , as a kgb man who saw the east german apparatchik fall down around him , then the soviet union itself , only to see someone like yeltsin be paraded around like a drunk asshole , is subjugation of the russian people ( and i 'd bet he takes a much more ` inclusive ' view of which people belong to a greater-russia ) at the hands of the west , whether by foreign domination or ideological ` subversion ' the idea of ukrainians not only hosting us troops , but ukrainians being people who * do n't * look up to russia , and * do n't * see their political future in the east , but with the west , is abominable to him . 
  the most piercing part of this fear , is a so-called ` color ' revolution . 
  where the us might sponsor and support political dissidents within russian satellite nations and eventually in russia itself , so as to give the appearance of organically developed and legitimate political revolution , all to bring about control and subjugation . 
  imagine if tymoschenko and yuschenko had not been followed by yanukovich , but * yet another * government even more friendly towards the west ? 
  disaster . 
  so when yanukovich was embattled by the euromaidan protests , when the country was in turmoil , putin did n't chance anything , and simply took crimea by force . 
  when it became clear that the succeeding government ( one viewed as totally illegitimate by putin still , i 'd wager ) was n't going to roll over , he moved on the donbass . 
  no one is going to go to war with putin over this , and there 's no way to win such a war , and he knows it . 
  but if ukrainians are europeans , if self determination matters , and if border integrity and national sovereignty of european nations matter to the eu , sanctions against russia for what putin has done must be ** harsh ** putin 's support is twofold : nationalist russians who are simply common folk ; younger people who scream * nashi !, 
  * , and older people who resent the loss of prestige and order that the soviet system provided , and the oligarchs - the vultures that engorged themselves on as much post-soviet privatization as they could , and who control most of the wealth in the nation . 
  the relationship putin likes to show to the common people in russia is that he is the big boss of all the oligarchs , and that they should n't worry so much about their power because putin is the common people 's strongman and he makes the wealthy bow to him for the good of russia . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xfbwndxcx8 ^ this is an orchestrated photo-op . 
  some housewife in moscow doing the washing watches this clucks her tongue and says to herself `` if only putin knew ! '', 
  when she sees something terrible later on . 
  in this way , the legitimacy of putin 's rule stays intact , despite its impotence in controlling what is the continuing lordship of the oligarchs over the common russian .
