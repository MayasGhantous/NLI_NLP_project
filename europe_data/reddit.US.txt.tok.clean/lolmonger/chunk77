  like , does putin throw his hands up and say `` and i would have gotten away with it too , if it were n't for those meddling kids ! '', 
  and does that happen without any dead dutchmen ? 
  this is why there was no intervention by the netherlands . 
   i think the dutch should have secured the crash site with their troops . 
  that would involve troops being deployed from the netherlands on a combat mission into ukraine , possibly shooting at ukrainian and russian nationals , possibly some of whom were russian federation troops . 
  not possible , both logistically and politically , for the dutch or the eu to stomach . 
  they 've had a lifetime of figuring out what looks good . 
  old people know how to keep stuff cozy . 
  http://www.bls.gov/fls/ichcc_nr_chart1.png consistent with ; https://www.destatis.de/en/pressservices/press/pr/graphics/earningslabourcosts/2014/labourcostseucomparisonstart2013.png?__blob=poster, 
  does n't matter . 
  even if these 20 officers and enlisted personnel of the russian federation army 53rd anti-air brigade were handpicked by sergey shoygu and reported directly to vladimir putin who gave the shoot-down order , it does n't matter . 
  even if vladimir vladimirovich were told `` hey , this is a civilian aircraft filled with civilians , many of whom are dutch nationals '' and putin responded with `` fuck them , and fuck their soccer team , bring it down '' and had a prostitute from amsterdam blow him after giving the order , it does n't matter . 
  no one is going to go to war with russia , european powers dependent on russian oil are n't going to cease doing business with them , no one is going to risk the peace-time political progress and earnings of the eu in order to fight for the donbass and crimea . 
  there 's no capability , there 's no will , and there 's no economic gain for such a course of action - - not even harsher sanctions , not even true isolation . 
  if the world , and the eu in particular , was n't ready to rush to the defense of ukraine after the budapest memoradum was so horribly violated , ready to stop doing business with russia after mh17 was shot down , unwilling to let putin skate after annexing eastern ukraine on top of crimea , etc when it was happening - - - why would they be so now ? 
  what 's changed ? 
  practically speaking , you ca n't have huge numbers of people doing without basic shit . 
  that 's just a recipe for disaster . 
  but you ca n't have the vast majority , or even a large minority , of people having their existence as net-dependent on a few whose productivity primarily goes to * others * instead of themselves . 
  the entire notion of a ` basic income ' for people without some attendant ` basic contribution ' on the part of people towards that society which owes them for some reason is a vulgar absurdity . 
  poland should just keep the z\u0142oty forever and create non-eu trade pacts with as many nations inside and outside the eu as possible . 
  just be sure to guard against cargo cultists . 
  the czechs have you guys beat on guns and beer , i 'm sorry to say . 
  the cz 805 bren is everything i thought the g36 was supposed to be ( have only fired a ` pistol ' version of the czech gun here in the states but it was a treat ) make sure you do n't lose your automotive prowess . 
  sometimes calling something fecund is used in an oblique way to suggest the situation or person is * full of shit * or * bullshit * . 
   the czech republic system as far as i know is actually more liberal than that of the state of new york or california several others as well as a few large cities in other states that have their own restrictive laws . 
  on top of that , that * new * machine gun ownership is a possibility in cz rep * at all * beats the entire us . 
  same same, 
  a ) more common in america obviously . 
  should n't be impossible for germany . 
  b ) well , you see , when you have border control and an application process , it 's actually pretty easy . 
  i 'm torn between dhokla and idli . 
   what does it mean to integrate for example in germany ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xavier_naidoo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philipp_r%c3%b6sler basically what happens here in america . 
   my only question to you is which brown guys who look like you are the ones who are not like you , and the ones we should deport or refuse to let in ? 
   how do people tell which is which ? 
  the ones that have sponsorship of native born citizens and high paying job recruitment . 
  really , that 's what you want . 
  race actually has very little to do with it after a certain point . 
  i do n't want a fuckton of poor russians/ukrainians/poles coming to the us in droves anymore than i want a fuckton of poor guatemalans/mexicans/hondurans - - i * do * want educated , skilled immigrants , though . 
  that 's about all . 
  we have too many americans who are unemployed/under employed in unskilled labor sectors for me to be okay with importing competitors for their livelihoods . 
  i do n't think we should * entirely * undo 1965 's laws ( which are what allowed my father and mother to immigrate to the us ) , but we should really , really tighten things up - including h1b visa standards/enforcement . 
   what did people think was going to happen when immigrants end up marginalised in slums ? 
  that 's not exactly a question for the right wing to answer , though . 
   for you , you should look at what when on historically ( and still goes on btw ) in places in america where brown guys were segregated by economic necessity and/or religion , cause it 's not pretty . 
  this is ** precisely ** why i am against mass-immigration , without scrutiny of an immigrant 's economic position , as a first generation american . 
  i * know * this history , i 'm a product of this history being known and recognized in our laws . 
  american hindus and sikhs have outright been murdered in the us because of anti-muslim reactionary sentiment ( all the while all three groups have members serving in the military , holding office , paying taxes , etc. ), 
  the leadership of a nation being * so * unwilling to address people 's fears is * exactly * what creates the vacuum that awful , awful radicals step into . 
  then instead of some yokel shooting up a gurudwara or stabbing a clerk because he thought sikhs were muslims and hindus were muslims ( when there are already plenty of perfectly integrated american muslims ) , it becomes a much larger movement . 
  we 've seen it happen in history , i see nothing that particularly stands in the way of it happening again , unless the problems are confronted head on . 
  i know right ? 
  boy oh boy , i just love it when white progressives who are very-defintely-not-racist-at-all let me know how i 'm supposed to act and think , and decide i 'm not a ` true ' minority if i step off the reservation . 
  i 'm serious , since you decided to go there and make it personal , and decided that minorities are supposed to think a certain way , if i post proof of my lovely chocolatey skin , will you just admit in a forthright way that you 're an idiot ? 
  is this what you want ? 
   so as a brown guy you would rather we judge everyone by the color of their skin does that look like what it is i 'm saying ? 
  i realize english might not be your first language . 
  ask another dutchman to help you out , i guess . 
   also , obligatory / r/asablackman will you admit you 're an idiot if i post proof i 'm a racial minority and yet - in an amazing display of agency and human cognition that you seem to think people with more melanin ca n't have - have n't been indoctrinated into swallowing progressive narratives ? 
  will you do it ? 
  these fortifications seem like they 're inspired by a much , much older doctrine of warfare than the time period they were being built in . 
  if europe does n't unite to put a stop to this , it will be ruinous . 
  imagine the position of one such as myself - who is a `` brown guy '' . 
  i really do want every leftist to understand this - what do you think happens to * me * and people like * me * when you * refuse * to engage with and speak about the problems of people who look * like me * and yet are * not * in any sense , like you and me ? 
  what do you think happens to * me * when * i * try living my life in a world that is majority white , where the anxieties of white people , native people to their own lands , go completely unaddressed ? 
  i was born and raised in the us ; this is my home , americans are my countrymen . 
  [ this was the soundtrack of my youth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6iko6lmxf4 ) . 
  family trips when i was a kid were to the uss constitution , to valley forge , the washington monument , etc. 
  * three * generations of my family , whose people 's heritage were under a british boot for centuries , served in the us military , proudly self determining their lives in a way that would 've been impossible in their ancestral homeland . 
  if you are someone who sympathizes with the left at all , if you think we should not be talking plainly , openly about the refugees and their culture , and the cultural enclaves they are raised in , what do you think happens to someone like me ? 
  do you think our existences become * easier * when we look just like these troublemakers ? 
  are the integrated peoples of foreign ancestry all across the west , born and raised there , worth * nothing * to you ? 
  what do you imagine happens to * their * ability to live their lives - - leave aside the white people in western nations for a moment - - what do you think happens to * their * existence when we do not confront this sickness being brought from outside the west ? 
  enough is enough - - europeans and americans ; westerners of all races and colors and creeds who value anything of the westphalian order , anything of the enlightenment , anything of the renaissance , any of the pluralist , secular , individualist and democratic systems of social ordering and governance that have built the west into what it is , need to rise up and refuse the apathy of their leaders to address these problems . 
   the nazis are often considered right-wing due to their collusion with corporate interests so if the national socialists can ` collude ' with corporate interests and be right wing , and the fascists of mussolini and neo-fascists of the peronista style can be called right wing , and politics of margaret thatcher can be called right wing , what * ca n't * be called right wing ? 
   their place within the libertarian/totalitarian spectrum . 
   libertarian/totalitarian spectrum . 
   libertarian/totalitarian what ? 
  the nazis have some place as * libertarians * ? 
  and libertarians are merely on a * spectrum * with totalitarians ? 
   hitler was n't concerned with building a ` big government ' ( let alone a welfare state - he would rather let the poor die in the gutter ! ), 
  are you fucking kidding ?!, 
  what do you think the volksgemeinschaft was ? 
  hitler and the nazi party were ** hugely ** concerned with welfare on socialist grounds in establishing their volkisch state !, 
   this twisted darwinism looks a lot like right-wing market policies . 
  ** you 're _ exactly _ what i 'm talking about in the comment you responded to . 
  ** where according to the left , `` everything bad '' becomes `` right wing '' so that anything right wing can be conflated with everything that is bad . 
  unbelievable . 
  ** there is no greater wealth in all the world than the wellbeing of your own family , of your own people . 
  ** until the people of every nation repudiate the globalists , the trans - and post-nationalists who are principally concerned with ordering the little people into convenient anti-individualist anti-sovereign polities that allow them control and their corporatist friends healthy profits , until then , there can only be complete poverty for the common person . 
  a poverty of pride , a poverty of history , a poverty of self determination - this way lies dissolution and degeneracy . 
   unemployment is number of unemployed divided by the labor force . 
  6 month old babies , people in a coma and 96-year-old great-great-grandmothers do not count as unemployed . 
  surely you see why including the number of people who at once not working * and * dependent on those who work is important to understanding the total number of people who do work , right ? 
   when exactly did the left get this shockingly dumb ? 
  it was like this before in universities as well , in europe and the us , particularly during the 70s . 
  what 's different is that after the 80s , 90s , and early 2000s of right wing domination of politics and news media ( which reached its zenith with the bush-fox news era here in the us ) , the academics have gotten such massive institutional coherence and legitimacy in what was * very ironically * a reactionary movement against this kind of right wing domination , that they are only too willing to populate news-media with fellow * bien-pensants * . 
  we 're seeing the politics of the student union turn into the blog writers turn into the new-media turn into the dominant political narratives of the modern society . 
  ____________________________ ** best example ** think about how often ugly social movements are called `` right wing '' what makes the modern neo-nazis `` right wing '' ?
