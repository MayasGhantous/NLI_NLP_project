  but whose society is it ? 
  why not massive fiscal transfers to africa and asia from european coffers ? 
  why is there so much opposition to inviting all the refugees and more in . 
  do n't pretend it 's unreasonable to not want ` the other ' to have one 's material wealth because plenty do n't view them as perfectly deserving of it . 
  the only difference between wealth transfers and immigration to and from romania into larger , wealthier eu nations and north africa is n't the money or land/job competition , it 's the difference between what one thinks of a romanian or a libyan . 
  until there is actually a european identity , there wo n't be a real european polity , and trying to force pan-european fiscal regimes will come with dysfunction . 
  the gambit that crises of necessity will force transnational union/federation is n't playing out . 
  i know right ? 
  would 've fit right in at the continental congress with that ponytail . 
  if being white requires genetic membership in the indo-european family ( and almost assuredly speaking the appropriate ethnicity 's language ) , and having fair hair , skin and caucasian features , then on arguably a few counts : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finno-ugric_languages https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-indo-europeans#genetics http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1712423/ , excepting the fact that fair pigments predominate , there 's a lot going for saying finns ( and hungarians , etc ) are n't `` white '' people in the same way the autochthonous peoples of the british isles or france or germany or iceland are `` white '' people . 
  but , frankly ; http://www.dps.texas.gov/texas10mostwanted/fugitives.aspx those guys * are n't white * , but there 's a lot of political pressure that results in them being called white hispanics here in the us . 
  and if these people : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/osmo_soininvaara https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikko_kouki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaana_saarinen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krista_kosonen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanja_karpela , are n't ` white people ' then i do n't even know anymore . 
  the elites of nations are rarely nationalists . 
  they 're global people who do n't care too much for what they see as provincial loyalities . 
  the melding and blending of identities to decrease all sorts of barriers of any activity that can become economic activity , and decrease individual ownership of resources and real estate and increase production and consumption is what they want . 
  everyone living in cramped urban spaces , with little sense of nation and ownership and lots of material indulgence is what they want for us - - high class serfdom . 
  immigration en masse is a boon for them , not only to crush wage norms and worker expectations , but the sense of the land being one 's own on lines of community and identity . 
  christianity post tours is what laid the foundations of westernity as we know it * including * secularism ( though it did n't intend to ) . 
  our dogmatic secular , pluralist , institutional morality owes so much to it . 
  i do n't think there could have been a renaissance without it . 
   we 're happy to be part of the west , as we 've always been . 
  y' all certainly use the right bible alphabet . 
  that 's why poland is taking its security obligations seriously , to itself and to nato . 
  they 're not messing around with the lives and futures of polish boys and girls as of yet unborn in terms of territorial integrity , economic development and opportunity , and political self determination , by letting their martial preparation lag . 
  it is * the * principal responsibility of the state . 
  some of us are totally in with poland , georgia , and the baltics on the russian issue : http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/16/ar2007071601873.html http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4485714/russia-discussed-first-presidential-debate-2008-election https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aa82t01ngc#t=3m05s _______________________________________________ some of us are not : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/17/missile-defence-shield-barack-obama https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1409sxbleg same deal with ukraine , but on that issue , most of the hemming and hawing came from eu nations on the sanctions issue , more so than the us - - similar tension though ; the right in the us tends to have very little compassion for economic distress , but that seems to translate to a much greater pugnacity in conflict than has the left ( and vice versa ) . 
  that 's only true for magazines with worn springs . 
  i 've had failure to feed in usgi/stanag mags and factory ak mags - - both cases it was just shitty springs ( not even follower tilt like with the older m16 mags ) . 
  pmags for the ar and ak have never given me issue with loading a full 30 . 
  most ftfs are rounds being incompletely seated when the bolt is being sent into battery , and that 's rarely the static feed ramps , but the mag follower not being pushed adequately by the spring . 
  a train full of stg44s and diamonds ... 
  good . 
  those who want to become swedish stay , those who do not want to become swedish go , and only the top of the other are let inside in the first place for the long haul . 
  tourism and foreign exchange are very different from permanent residence and citizenship . 
  ^ my startup 's partnering with an app development firm whose backend devs are in belarus , czech and slovak republics . 
  but we 're incorporated in the us ... 
   and anyone with enough intelligence to at least pass subjects is automatically admitted ? 
  no , because we produce far too many people capable of succeeding in harvard , yale , and princeton to find room for at those schools , so they percolate down on through the other globally dominant us universities , which is why decade after decade , the entire world wants to come here for university education http://graphics.wsj.com/which-country-has-the-most-nobel-prizes/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abel_prize#laureates https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_the_number_of_us_dollar_billionaires https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_fdi_abroad http://archive.sciencewatch.com/dr/sci/08/jun15-08_1/ http://in-cites.com/research/2004/march_8_2004-1.html like , is this a fucking mystery to you or what ? 
  we 're 315 + million people with the most productive national economy in the history of mankind , sure , we have some poverty and we have people who do n't perform ... . but what did you expect our universities to be like ? 
   the us have the balls to handle their problems because unlike the eu washington does n't need the approval of california or new york to do anything . 
  it does , actually , in terms of financing wars - - a power held by congress through representatives and senators who pressure the executive . 
  generally however , the federal congress does not fail to support the federal executive in war powers . 
  it 's entirely in their hands , however , to do so , and force the executive to limit military action to 90 days of non-congressional authorized action . 
  an example of this was clinton 's use of military force in bosnia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/campbell_v._clinton but you 're right : in practice , congressional authorizations of military force * do not * depend on state governments , because state representation in the federal congress basically just rolls with the aims of the commander in chief . 
   i 'm starting to think that putin 's game is to see if he can disband nato . 
  or at least to make it harder for new states to become members . 
  ** ding ding ding ** https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33x01c/moldova_blocks_supplies_to_russian_army_in/cqp8e53 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ putin is pushing at the edges of the paperworks of civilization and post-war peace , because he is asserting a new russian dominance . 
  he is calling into question what it really means for there to be an eu , what it really means for there to be a unsc , what it really means for there to be a nato . 
   maybe europian countries should start to play dirty with russia as well . 
  no need to play dirty . 
  more eu nations who are nato members spending the money to acquire : 1 ) modern fighter and multi-role aircraft , surface-to-air batteries , and anti-armor capability ( tanks , tank killing manpads ) 2 ) troop levels of some import 3 ) energy sources that are n't russia , concurrent with * greatly * stepped up economic sanctions is all it would take . 
  grind down more and more of the russian population into an existence that is more and more miserable with each passing year , and make any military provocation from russia against an eu or nato member only a chance at risking slaughter . 
  either putin will break , or the russians will break putin . 
  good . 
  time for turkey to choose westernity/nato or it 's pathetic ethno-religious squabbling . 
  ` the peshmerga ' is n't anything either . 
  that literally is just the word for warrior/soldier in kurdish . 
  it 's as useful as ` jihadis ', 
   yes , `` white '' tells you soooooo much about the `` prevailing demographic , culture , and language '' . 
  in contrast to arab , asian , african ? 
  yes it does . 
  even better is ` scandinavian ' or ` anglo ' or ` slavic ' and then you get even more information that is n't there otherwise . 
  i do n't know why you 're disputing what adjectives do . 
  just in case , though , this is the point of adjectives . 
  they qualify nouns . 
   what is the deal with immigration in the long term ? 
  do you accept that different countries are different because of the political choices of the people living there , their cultures , their language , their histories and forms of government ? 
  and do you accept that people can prefer different forms of government , social norms , culture and life opportunities based on the way their or someone else 's country is ? 
  and do you accept that in systems where majority voices win political power locally or globally within a political system , it is the majority whose life opportunities and culture and chosen systems of government are catered to ? 
  because if those ring true , and you happen to be the beneficiary of communal systems that project you , you 're not going to be super willing to see them changed by the influx of * others * who want to change it all to suit them . 
  washingtonians and oregonians regularly bitch and moan about all the people from * california * becoming transplants for this reason . 
  people have private clubs for this reason . 
  you keep your door closed when you want to be at home in peace for this reason . 
  it 's not like there are n't homeless people you could invite to use and take * your * food , shelter , clothing , or offer them a shower . 
   if the majority in south africa is black , does that mean we should call it a `` black country '' ? 
  yes , but african country would be better , so that you distinguish between black ( generally referring to american blacks , and uk blacks ) and north african ( which is significantly arab/berber in presence )  why ? 
  what purpose does it serve ? 
  talk about the prevailing demographic , culture , and language . 
  you 're not gon na hear a lot of , say , iberian language and music in an african country , just as talking about an asian country means your knowledge of the bantu family 's verb forms is n't going to help that much . 
   all you 're doing is exluding the minority and saying that it 's not a country for you all you 're doing is projecting . 
  telling the german that engineering and scientific work is all done in english , eh ? 
  alright . 
  same deal here . 
  this is often pointed out by non-english apologists , but the fact of the matter is that we never did because it was never necessary/who * did n't * speak english/etc . 
  language is a tool for communication , but the reason there are ever different languages is necessary there are different communities , chosen and by circumstances , for whom communication is more frequent than outside it . 
  dialect is just a weaker case of language , slang even weaker , differences in diction the most subdued version of it all . 
  but the * separation * of human interests is why languages are ever different . 
  so , everyone speaking the same language can reflect not only that the interests of people are shared ... but also that one group has subsumed the interests of the other . 
  the celtic peoples are in a nicer version of the situation of the native south americans now all speaking spanish ( with precious few nauhatl and oaxaca speakers left ) . 
  it 's not a coincidence however , that the strongest sentiments of politicial difference among the maligned native tribes of mexico are those who may still organize around their common tongue , speaking the language of their fathers , and not the invaders . 
  i 'm not irish at all , but if i were i 'd get as much gaelige as i could given the history . 
  holland and holland rifles and shotguns are actually absurdly well made . 
  maybe it 's because i 'm scarcely older than the post-soviet order of the russian federation myself , and so i do n't remember a lot of the ` smaller ' events of the cold war ... but does this strike anyone else as incredibly childish ? 
  like , in the sense of being hard to take seriously ? 
   if chapman is our standard for russian intel agents goodness , no . 
  aldrich ames and robert hanssen 's kgb/svr handlers are the standard - - they compromised the highest levels of the us security apparatus for decades , and in hanssen 's case , even past the breakup of the soviet union . 
  says the american who wants the ppaca repealed , wants to get rid of the nfa , and wants to see states control education , not the federal government . 
  no property taxes , but just on income and investment returns ( and lower ones at that ) would be cool too . 
  centralization is bad ; centralized systems are * okay * if they 're managed correctly . 
  every criticism i have of centralization of power is ultimately just the american critique of government in the first place , as it is simply a system wherein many individual 's agency is collected ( centralized even ) in some authority to protect their assets .
