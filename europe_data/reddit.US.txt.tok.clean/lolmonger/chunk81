  never been to miami or smaller cities all across the american southwest , i take it . 
  we 've also since 1986 continually failed to adequately implement our own law , and substantial ( millions and millions , literally at least 1/300 people ) numbers of illegally entered aliens are now here , totally subverting our economic and cultural norms . 
   france and germany did n't give anything to putin . 
  they did , and do , by not participating in even harsher sanctions , and not reorienting their economic ties towards eu nations and peaceful european non-eu nations * over * russia . 
   remember that ukraine is n't in u.e. 
  and is n't in nato , either . 
  france and germany are , and do n't meet their mutual defense obligations . 
   on that basis , french and german leaders have done what they could to prevent the ukrainian civil people of dying , starving , and freezing . 
  dying , starving , and freezing because the russian federation saw the people of ukraine rebel against their puppet government , and decided to annex parts of their country by force . 
  french and german politicians should n't have opted for war , but they should n't have been so willing to continue to do business with the russians . 
  this kind of move : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-eu-sanctions-iduskbn0ox1eo20150617 wherein european leaders basically say `` we 're only going to be angry temporarily '' , is weak tea . 
  weak tea for this reason : http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/world/europe/eu-to-extend-sanctions-against-russia-but-divisions-show.html  at the center of the dispute were tensions between prime minister matteo renzi of italy and chancellor angela merkel of germany over the pipeline project , nord stream 2 , which would significantly increase the amount of russian gas delivered to germany and other parts of europe while bypassing ukraine . 
  the original nord stream is one managed by putin 's friend schroeder , and putin 's ( former stasi ) friend warnig . 
  that half of germany was part of the soviet union shows in its politics . 
  us and eu sanctions should be * indefinite * , and * much * harsher , and they should collaborate on developing industries and energy availability within the eu and within peaceful non-eu nations that cut russia out of export and import of energy and consumer goods , until they 're willing to remove their troops from another nation 's soil , disavow their separatist proxies , and recommit to a stricter version of the budapest memorandum . 
  i think nationalism is healthy if people are made aware of how it can be perverted . 
  a peoples fervor for their country is just like the immune response of a fever - useful to drive out a foreign contaminant and inspire protection ; potentially dangerous to the body itself if unchecked . 
  i do n't know that any european nationalism can exist however , without a european nation , which requires a european * people * , a european * cultural history * and a european * language * . 
  i 'd sooner anticipate a gro\u00dfe deutschland with a future benelux like arrangement with the netherlands and parts of belgium and france and poland and the czech republic and the \u00d6sterreich becoming a reality through decades ( closer to a century ) of peaceful negotiation and economic/political cooperation ( this time ) than a totally unified europe which also includes germany . 
  same deal for the nordics , the non-russian slavs , the anglosphere ( a greater britannia again ) etc. 
  birds of a feather , and all that . 
  just like they found three chechens to take the fall for anna politkovskaya 's assassination and never found who ordered the murder . 
  10/10 trolling , btw . 
  i 've never seen it this good . 
  you are correct . 
   how do you measure how homogeneous the eu or the us is ? 
  barring literally everything else for the moment , * you are aware * , i presume , that the language of the american people across centuries and governments has always been english ? 
  and that there are over a dozen different languages and different subfamilies of ie represented among the eu 's member states ? 
   what do people in rural kentucky or montana have in common with people in palo alto ? 
  more than people in rural lithuania have with people in lima . 
   what has a baptist in the midwest in common with an iranian immigrant in new york or washington ? 
  more than a god fearing pole in rzepin has with an atheist ex-muslim in london . 
  * e pluribus unum * , mein kumpel [ ** this is literally what our national identity is built on ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpixlurijxg ) , this is the root of our patriotism and jingoism , it 's what makes us chant usa !, 
  usa ! , it 's what drives us to plant flags on the moon and sail aircraft carriers around earth , like we have any right to do it in the first place . 
  the intensity and fervor of our nationalism has never subsided ; it is a mantle that our political sectors of all kinds fight over . 
  * that * does not exist in * any * measure if you invoke ` europa ' that kind of unity and mythology and romanticism simply is n't present . 
  the entire national history of germany is one of people from similar ethnicities being united - for better and worse - by leaders of that ethnicity - for better and worse - as germans . 
  only very * recently * has the german experience been one which accommodates by intent or circumstance , foreign elements . 
  america 's unity has from the get go been a tension between the other that is opposed to us , and the other that becomes us . 
  our unity is built on the premise that we 're all weird and different and elect to come together . 
  that does n't exist for any kind of `` europe '' and it wo n't unless the sovereignty of germany and the ethnicity of germany becomes only as meaningful as `` texan '' or `` pennsylvanian '' . 
  what do you think has to happen to the different languages ? 
  it 's not that bad . 
  georgia [ can ] ( http://cdn.onlyinyourstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/8216183927_be59f14f02_k-700x525.jpg ) actually [ look ] ( http://cdn.onlyinyourstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4509107411_1d90e15ae8_b-700x468.jpg ) quite [ nice ] ( http://cdn.onlyinyourstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/3774644810_e6a8f888e5_b-700x466.jpg ) if you [ stop by ] ( http://cdn.onlyinyourstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/19354196816_9b4e608fae_k-700x467.jpg ), 
  people still fuck up with guns here , too , even if they should know better ; it 's not just the europeans who do that . 
  bellicose people are the people who turn polemical ( ruh roh - greek ! ), 
  notions into martial contests , however . 
  direct inheritance of latin did n't happen for any of her daughters , but they got her eyes and her nose and her chin , etc. 
  first , they signed on to a common articles of confederation , then a common constitution . 
  and because we fought a civil war and drastically undermined non-federalist norms of government in our effort to preserve the union , we 've massively ( each time after a large war , actually ) increased the scope of our federal government leading to the same political fights over state lawmaking against d.c. lawmaking on a myriad of issues . 
  i know way more about american history than you do , i 'm sure , and was not ignorant or deliberately ignoring the civil war when i made that point . 
  i 'm merely saying that the identity of the american people was such that we * have * to call it a civil war , and not a war between an unrelated and mutually foreign union and confederacy . 
  this is entirely different from the shared identity that exists among . 
  current eu members , where if any war broke out , it would be a war between sovereign nations and distinct peoples with different languages . 
  the eu is n't nearly as homogeneous as the ante or postbellum us , and ideas which assume since federalism can be achieved in the us ( which it still totally has n't , nor i think should ! ), 
  then it can be done in the eu , by whatever means , are perilously ignoring this fact . 
   functional federalism will build a shared identity . 
  and it will look pretty fucking dysfunctional while it 's happening . 
  perhaps the horse can push the cart , but i think there 's a better way . 
   i think us americans tend to forget that it took about 100 years for the us to move from a bunch of fairly loosely aligned independent states to a strong federal republic . 
  that 's not quite true . 
  an american identity distinct from a continental british one existed long before the revolutionary war , being first apparent in the french-indian wars when even british correspondence to magisterial authorities recognized that people who had now for a generation been born and had been dying in the new world were not entirely british . 
  this is n't in a weird anthropological `` oh !, 
  they do n't powder their wigs ! '', 
  sense , but in a political one . 
  furthermore , while we 've greatly eroded the republican ideals of the united states and moved ever closer to complete federalism in the antebellum period , and while we were certainly not as close as vermonters and carolinians today as during the * civil war * , it was not as though the revolutionary war before it was merely 13 colonies of disparate political ambition and distinct polity making a temporary pact to remove a common oppressor . 
  we were the united states then , too . 
  furthermore , even with the massive and encouraged influx of foreigners , we almost all still , hundreds of years on from the first settlements at plymouth rock and roanoke , speak * english * . 
  all of this is much further towards a unified identity than whatever kinship can be claimed between a spaniard and a slovak , or an greek and an dutchman . 
  no , but if britain had been * better * prepared , argentina would n't have tried shit , or there would n't have been nearly as many british casualties trying to fight a developing nation . 
   most people who arrived in what is now usa were n't american either . 
  depends on what you mean . 
  even before ( and it 'd have to be true , right ? ), 
  july 4 , 1776 , there was a distinctly ` american ' flavor of the anglo-saxon identity that existed among the otherwise ` british ' people who colonized the area and took swathes of it away from competing dutch and french claims on the aboriginal people 's territories . 
  it 's simply grown and grown and gone through evolutions in less than three hundred years with some flavoring from the 18th , 19th , and 21st century additions of europe and latin america . 
  it 's a very different situation from the centuries and centuries of single culture , ethnicity , and language groupings that have existed in small spaces in europe , carved out through bloody warfare . 
  how valid do you think a `` macedonian '' identity is ? 
  one probably existed before the nation-state was made as we know it today ( fyrom is n't even used by our own state department now ) , but i 'd bet good money there are still people who think of it as `` other bulgaria '' or `` buncha slavs appropriate greek iconography '' . 
  there just might not be any a century from now . . 
  when the british sent troops to quash my nation 's rebellion , the resistance messengers rode out among the colonies shouting `` the * regulars * are coming out ! '', 
  referring to regular uniformed troops of the crown . 
  in almost all lay-history , that gets changed to `` the british are coming ! '', 
  in paul revere 's ride , because no one today could conceive of what the american colonists felt - - they still thought of themselves as * british * in culture and origin , it would make no sense to have said ( back then ) the `` british '' are coming out , but today it 's impossible for americans to wrap their head around the idea of shooting at regulars - - those are american troops !, 
  also during our revolution , when your country as it was before and after the kaiser and fuhrer came to power did n't yet exist , the british employed mercenary companies from hesse and saxony . 
  some of the `` not yet '' pennsylvanians on * our * side who shot at them with long rifles built in the jaeger tradition spoke the same dialects of german as those troops !, 
  identity is a very funny thing , but it is the * only * thing that matters , i think , when it comes to political choices being made . 
  the only way to evaluate , practically , `` is this good '' or `` is this bad '' is under the schema of `` is this good or bad * for us * ? 
  that requires a people to think of an `` us '' , no matter how recent , artificial , or evolved from something else that `` us '' is . 
  the same thing happens here in the us when one of our major parties gets a unified legislature and the executive ( with the congress 's house of representatives and senate and the presidency ) they try passing all sorts of bullshit that reflects ultimately just a narrow political sentiment , but will affect 300 million people ( and generally in policy areas that the states could and ought handle themselves ) , and then everyone bitches and moans about how the law sucks and is dysfunctional , etc. 
  because it * does * suck and * is * dysfunctional . 
  federalism , i.e. 
  ` union ' is only viable insofar as there is unity to back it up . 
  the best partners are ones who agree , ultimately . 
  whenever you try forcing union * before * agreement , it 's a little bit like putting two unrelated people in a room and telling them `` well , you 're married now ! '', 
  if you 're lucky you found people whose parts and orientations match up , and if you 're * really * lucky , they find each other attractive and think the same things about how to decorate the living room . 
  forced political union just does n't work ; only when different parties naturally and organically propose and accede to one another 's terms because they * want * that union , do things work out . 
   we all know that the main stumbling block of further integration and closer union is the lack of a distinct european identity in societies ' discourse . 
  you might as well write `` the main stumbling block in this marriage is that one of us is a single father and gay man who works from home , and one of us is an asexual woman who does n't want kids and wants to travel '' ________________________ the federalist gambit would be much more respectable , if they could define what `` europe '' is . 
  does europe include turkey ? 
  does europe include ukraine ?
