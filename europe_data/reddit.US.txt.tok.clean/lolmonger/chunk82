  are georgians european ? 
  are russians european ? 
  is that europe ? 
  is it something that the eu should accommodate and maybe include in future policy decisions ? 
  what * is * europe ? 
  what * is * the shared identity ? 
  http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/about/index_en.htm  the eu is a unique economic and political partnership between 28 european countries that together cover much of the continent . 
   the eu was created in the aftermath of the second world war . 
  the first steps were to foster economic cooperation : the idea being that countries who trade with one another become economically interdependent and so more likely to avoid conflict . 
  of course the european coal and steel and community endeavors all folded into the eu as it evolved from an economic to a political organization . 
  but * what is * the eu ? 
   human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights : these are the core values of the eu . 
  who the fuck does n't stand for that shit ? 
  what distinguishes it ? 
  that 's not even what matters - - every society should have at least * some * self awareness to want to conceive of itself as the `` good guys '' . 
  what 's * european * ? 
  what is * european * culture ? 
  culture is where political expectations and values derive from , and it 's there that policy is informed . 
  what 's european culture ? 
  is it german culture ? 
  french culture ? 
  pan-anglo culture ? 
  slavic culture ? 
  ~ ~ eastern ~ ~ * central * european culture ? 
  there 's not even a common language in which to transmit cultural ideas . 
   we all know that social identities are constructed by defining itself in opposition to an other . 
  is that so ? 
  opposition to an ` other ' may be part of it , but it 's not like every nation is pakistan . 
  _____________________________ until there is an * actual * european identity , no functional federalism is really possible . 
  looking at how passive and effete western europe has been with the migrant situation and economic crisis , i 'm not sure everyone in yurop is even willing to fight and die for their * own * country . 
  nation-states have a duty to protect their people , even when it means preparing for realities too frightful or morbid to enter the mind of a comfortable , safe person , lest their society be unable to withstand circumstances that are very uncomfortable and very unsafe . 
  you do n't live anywhere near the ukraine conflict , you do n't live anywhere near syria , you 've lived in a nation that has had no external security threats since the end of ww2 because of massive defence architecture overseen and maintained by some of the most powerful nations on the planet . 
  that does n't mean there are n't threats . 
   all participating member states oh , and will there be minimum required contributions ? 
  will those be equal ? 
   european parliament european parliament members elected by the populations of each nation , are going to be a legislative body that sets policy for a military ? 
  stationed where ? 
  doing what ? 
   european parliament oh , so the eu parliament is going to craft a new executive that has command over a military ? 
  and there wo n't be * any * issue of sovereignty ? 
  what does the command leadership look like ? 
   european union citizens does each eu nation have the same number of citizens enrolling ? 
  what language is used by infantry over the radio ? 
  what language are intelligence dossiers written in ? 
  what happens if certain eu nations do n't find willing recruits ? 
  can other nations conscript them ? 
  finances , sovereignty , political functioning , actual logistics . 
  none of this is * anything * the eu has proven itself on . 
  that 's because you know no american administration would ever see the uk under threat and be like `` lol , k '' , just like you guys would n't ever let the irish get fucked with by someone else . 
  ** bahahahahahahaha ** and who will finance the common army ? 
  and who will set policy for the common army ? 
  and who will command the common army ? 
  and who will enroll in the common army ? 
  the eu ca n't even get immigration policy right , the ez ca n't even get monetary policy right . 
  it 's a dysfunctional mess of competing priorities and backstabbing . 
  how about germany just meets the fucking * tiny * nato development and spending guidelines instead ? 
   their income is nothing when compared to people that side with american policy of producing and selling weapons fucking duh people who build and sell products will always make more money than people who are simply ideologues . 
  industrial concerns which have a vested interest in global peace like car and refrigerator manufacturers also make way more money than warmongering public commentators , too . 
  it 's not because there 's any conspiracy . 
  it would n't make sense in that context because obama is both a strong backer of planned parenthood and abortion rights and anti-gun rights . 
  if there had been a high profile mass shooting committed with a formerly banned weapon in 2005 after gwb let the federal assault weapons ban expire , a news article that talked about `` bush 's america '' and gun crime would be on the nose . 
  obama 's gun views have very little to do with accepting the notion of firearms access * or * being anti-abortion , so it would n't make sense for an article to put something negative happening with firearms or planned parenthood on him . 
  vladimir putin , in contrast , probably would n't prefer a world where more people like vlad kolesnikov were openly challenging his regime and were free to do so without law enforcement harassment . 
  so , when housing subsidies are provided , they should be isolating people from their old communities and immersing them in only french speaking , culturally french places . 
  just like how you train students in study abroad programs to force themselves to pickup the language and culture . 
  strong civics programs should be a part of all youth education . 
  the history of france should be something written into the heart of every 10 year old living as a french national . 
  nationalism should not be an ugly word . 
  it should be pursued intelligently . 
  unemployment should not be tolerated - if make work programs are necessary , so be it . 
  young men should not be left unskilled and unoccupied . 
  they should be offered compensation and financial independence by the state if they are at risk of radicalization . 
  ( which means we need to study how and why islamist radicalization happens , and its circumstances eschewed ) a new generation of french people , regardless of their origins and religion need to grow up feeling french , proud to be french , and invested in the future wellbeing of france by deliberate incentive and program in the education system , and in the employment fields . 
  i am not a fan of the current policies of the israeli govermement , nor do i want to see france destroy civil liberties for french muslims anymore than it would fail to protect french jews . 
  they 're both french . 
  i would like to see france 's government take a very hard line against radical islam , call it that , and aggressively pursue leads against terror suspects and greatly incentivise social and economic assimilation of immigrant muslim communities . 
  they should lose an algerian , or berber or syrian or whatever identity and have a french one in a generation or so . 
  their religion is n't important . 
  they need , just like the jews need , to feel * french * and proud of being french . 
  that is how france will protect itself . 
  i mean , besides the us publicly pushing for harsher sanctions on russia by its eu partners , i think yes , that a lot of eu sanctions on the russian energy sector and export for the russian consumer market are n't * entirely * about ukraine , and are motivated by a desire for them to work in concert with saudi arabia distorting the oil markets . 
  i 'm not even pro-zionist , i think there should be a country with a hebrew name of israel and an arabic name of palestine with a dual government and civil code and shared capital for autonomous parts of the nation with controlled inter-religious immigration and mixed schooling . 
  one-state solution is the only way this shit gets solved , and neither zionism nor jihad can be a part of that . 
  i was just describing the mindset of people who might not be zionists at first turning towards israel when they 're pressured . 
  feels very strange to see another american call that ` stormfront ' worthy ... 
   i 've seen similar talking points on stormfront ** you 've seen similar points arguing in favor the necessity of a jewish identity that is martial and assertive and upheld by the state of israel on stormfront ? 
  ** dude . 
   meanwhile the muslims are mostly poor , uneducated , with little to no family or contacts and in a nation that hates them and that 's wrong , and i think europe needs to aggressively integrate existing muslim populations ( particularly those who are native born citizens who feel isolated ) into the national identity . 
  come off the stormfront accusations . 
   how the fuck could france protect all jews i dunno , i do n't think they have to protect all jews . 
  i think their government should signal complete contempt for radical islam and * greatly * step up anti-islamist police efforts . 
   taking away muslim human and civil rights would be a horrible and counterproductive thing to do . 
   monitoring all communications ? 
  france seems to be opting for this , actually , and it 's a damned shame . 
   your stormfront propaganda  be writing about why jews feel alienated and insecure  point out historical truths about jewish persecution  look at it from the perspective of a racial and religious minority american  if white supremacists threatened me and usg was all ' k whatev '  `` stormfront propaganda '' [ ** mfw ** ] ( http://www.dailytravelphotos.com/images/2009/090920_darjeeling_india_guy_handlebar_mustache_img_5567.jpg ), 
   no country with a strictly oil economy will survive with $ 10 oil price for a decade or even half a decade one with a stranglehold over their already destitute populace and a military protection/hardware for currency use arrangement with america and trillions of dollars could . 
   norway is also loaded with money is a western democracy , has people who have to be kept at a certain high standard of living , and does n't have nearly the political autonomy and ability to simply be fascist towards its people or neighbors that saudi arabia has . 
   russia could let the ruble slide , and it still has borrowing capacity , does it not ? 
  but borrowing from * whom * ? 
  themselves ?
