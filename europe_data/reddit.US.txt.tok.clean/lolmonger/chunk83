  the shittier their currency situation gets , the worse their borrowing terms because any possible economic prospectus is going to have less and less real value for foreign investment or domestic production for export . 
  who will lend to them , or rather , buy russian debt ? 
  the chinese ? 
  who else ? 
  are they just going to pursue quantitative easing and really try recapitalizing their banks with rubles lower and lower in value as russians can purchase less and less ? 
  i do n't think us/eu sanctions are really hard enough , but russia ca n't say `` oh , they 're al-quaida sympathizers '' and then bomb the fuck out of its own people if instability leads to open revolt the way the saudis can . 
   russia has sources of revenue other than oil and gas . 
  though their industry is generally laughable , they do have other exports ( food , armaments , iron/aluminum/titanium / copper etc. , wood , wood products ) except the us can keep pressuring the eu to sanction those exports and cut the russians out of those markets . 
  no one is talking about sanctioning saudi arabia for its sins in crimea . 
  this is the lynchpin of the saudi-us anti-russia strategy . 
  the russian horse is stronger , but does n't have grain to eat in the stable . 
  the saudi horse is fatter and slower , and it will still be alive after a week of neither eating . 
   saudi arabia is losing a war in yemen for now . 
  the houthis are n't exactly up against nothing ; saudi arabia , yemeni government forces , jordan and the us . 
  for all their pro-shiite sentiment , it 's not like iran is doing anything substantial via hezbollah to help the yemeni rebels ; they have their own shit right now . 
  in terms of which set of people have more money , more troops , more hardware , and more international sanction to kill * especially * considering all substantial non-us cooperation is russian and syrian ... 
  i mean , i wo n't say the houthis are fucked , but it 's not like a protracted conflict is in their favor at all . 
   opec is dead venezuela and libya are , and effectively iraq and iran as far as security unthreatened by political moves on oil are - yeah . 
  who do you think has benefited the most from this * if not * saudi arabia , the pan-sunni military complex of its bedfellows with the us , and the us itself ? 
   why they 're not cutting production - they simply ca n't . 
  no , they could , just as they did in 1979 to pre-iran crisis levels . 
  it was a huge mistake , and they wo n't do it again . 
  they already stepped up their production from 2014 when 2015 rolled around . 
  they 'll do it again . 
  they * do n't have to care about price * - they care about marketshare , and frankly , if they can slaughter the rest of the opec nation 's ability to even get product to market by killing everyone 's profits so that they can clamber back up over the bodies to be the dominant vendor when prices can rise again , they 'll do it . 
   genuinely believing that saudi arabia would be in a better place than russia in the event of a 10 dollar oil barrel is laughable to say the least why ? 
  what strains do you think would manifest in the saudi economy and domestic situation that would n't be 10fold worse in russia ? 
  hitler makes : 1 ) sophisticated , articulate arguments 2 ) passionate , emotional arguments 3 ) reasonable sounding , righteous arguments in * mein kampf * , about the situation of the german people , about race , about the human condition of struggle and excellence , and about his political desires . 
  and he was * completely wrong * ; on moral grounds , on scientific grounds , and on martial grounds - - committing slaughter , subscribing to fantastical racial theories ( though not nearly as much as people like himmler ) , and ultimately losing the war spectacularly badly to the mongrel armies of the soviet union and the united states , where slavs and blacks and mixed race populations and non-teutonic weak democratic and bolshevik peoples ultimately defeated his nordic supermen in military contests of production , fighting , and intelligence gathering over and over and over again . 
  the seductiveness of hitler 's spoken and written arguments should be presented , unabashed and unfiltered to young people - - and then they should learn the history of the war and some biology . 
  this i think will be the best antidote , truly , an inoculation , so that they should feel a small amount of the fever that overtook the german people , but have the immunity of sense and perspective given to them for it . 
   why ca n't france protect its own people ? 
  this is a crucial component of it . 
  in thomas friedman 's ( rather excellent book ) * from beirut to jerusalem * , he talks at one point about how begin was one of the people who saw the usefulness of a people having a sense of * power * . 
  family , a sense of togtherness and belonging is * security * and * pride * all wrapped up . 
   `` begin , who was born in 1913 , spent the formative years of his youth in poland in an era of rampant anti-semitism , in a world in which jews were spat upon . 
  he lived for the chance to correct the indignities that he and his forefathers had suffered for centuries . 
  begin loved the idea of jewish power , jewish generals , jewish tanks , jewish pride . '', 
  friedman goes on to call this pornographic , and attributes begin 's desire to fight against arafat to be the only thing which would rid him of personal anxieties about jewish cultural and political impotence in self determination , which is a * bit * much for me to accept . 
  ** but ** imagine being a frenchman who has grown up believing that he is a jew . 
  that he is a citizen of france , a son of france , and his religion is judaism , and that in the modern western world , he is no longer second class like his grandfather was , like his grandfather was before him . 
  that the west and france which suffered through the nazis and the shoah has prevailed , and his people are * still here * . 
  ______________ and then charlie hebdo is shot up . 
  and then jews are being killed . 
  and then the same perpetrators do it and a person you know died at a concert , murdered by people who hate the west and hate it because of ** you ** . 
  because your very existence is something they want to stamp out . 
  and then you look around and you see france not protecting you . 
  you see the same death and destruction that occurred , only in smaller scale , and you start to wonder - - why is n't france doing more ? 
  are n't i french ? 
  and then you look at your cousin 's pictures during taglit and you see him , french just as you are ... ... standing next to a proud looking * israeli * - - just as jewish as you both are . 
  and he 's not hiding in a freezer , he 's not cowering under a desk . 
  he 's in fatigues , holding a not the famas that did n't come in time to save your friend at the concert , but a * tavor * . 
  he 's not just behind a desk , he 's leaning on a * merkava * tank . 
  a jewish tank . 
  and you know that if someone comes to slaughter jews , this guy wo n't chastise you for feeling the piercing existential fear you 've been feeling . 
  he wo n't call you a bigot , he wo n't say you do n't understand the refugee situation and that your fears are over blown . 
  if slaughter is threatened again , he 's going to start delivering the fury of a people - not a french people , not a european people , but a jewish people - who have been slaughtered over and over again for millennia , at 900 meters/second . 
  _______ so it 's not even that french immigration to israel is at an all time high - - it really is that these people who see themselves being targeted as jews , are n't being protected by their french government as jews , and are occasionally scolded as frenchmen . 
  so they 're going to opt by and large to be israeli . 
  ** i 'm not french , not european , not jewish , etc. 
  ** but this shit is so obvious . 
  if people started killing americans who were n't white ( for that reason ) as part of a large organized ideological mission ( as the kkk once did ) and the us government were like `` well , but we ca n't be * too * hard on everyone who is associated with white supremacists , we do n't want to look like we blame regular white people '' , i 'd be shaken to my core about my identity as an american , as a patriot . 
  it would be unthinkable to me . 
   saudi arabia is killing its own economy as well and they know what they 're doing . 
  during the 70s oil crisis , they tried cutting production in order to raise prices . 
  instead , they lost market share . 
  they 're never going to make that mistake again - and they can afford to do the even more painful thing , as russia is hit with sanctions , and as iran is hoping to bring more capacity online for export : * expand their supply to drop prices further * they want to : 1 ) fuck over shiite iran ( brownie points with arms dealing sugar daddy america ) 2 ) fuck with russia ( samsies ) 3 ) fuck over any canadian and american domestic production that wants in on the energy game but requires high returns to become established ________________________________ the saudis are ** fucking loaded ** . 
  aramco has been doing billion dollar a day revenue for a long time now . 
  they 're valued somewhere between 1 and 7 ** trillion ** dollars . 
  if wti goes to 10 dollars a barrel for the next decade , they 'll be fine . 
  they wo n't be happy ; the princelings wo n't be getting new lamborghinis just because , the military will have to do more work silencing dissent , but they 'll be fine . 
  they have plenty of currency , bonds , fungible assets . 
  these people have everything from the high finance paper listed holdings in swiss banks to storehouses of gold and diamonds , outright ownership of commodity sources ( like , literal fucking forests and clean water reserves ) not just investments and derivative contracts , a massive military and a very cozy cash-petrol-military hardware purchase arrangement with the world 's only super power . 
  russia would n't be so fine if we went to 10 dollar barrel oil . 
  iran would n't be so fine if we went to 10 dollar barrel oil - - not with those country 's export profiles . 
  they * need * people buying expensive oil to have positive cashflow for everything from paying troops to keeping the lights on . 
  ______________  any argument for scottish independence has just been seriously dampered . 
  this is unfortunate if one staked their hopes of an independent scotland on energy , but i think it is short term , for the same reason that ireland ultimately did n't require an oil economy to have legitimate reasons to become an independent nation , despite having such a deep historical and cultural connection with the uk . 
  at some point , people are just going to fundamentally and permanently disagree on policy and interests to the point of not considering themselves the same people , and that 's when it 'll happen , if it happens . 
  if younger kids born in what is called scotland overwhelmingly think of themselves as scottish and the uk 's politicians as english for long enough , and resent the policy differences badly enough , it 'll happen . 
   the only country that stands to benefit from any of this price volatility is the united states well , kinda . 
  plenty of our states , particularly those in appalachia , which lost their steel and coal economy and manufacturing decades ago and have basically been skating buy on tertiary services , agriculture , and a shadow of the former industry they had , have had a small renaissance because of shale oil and natural gas , and they 'll be in deep trouble if energy stays cheap , even with winters always upping demand . 
  that 's why this is so tricky . 
  it 's * exactly * also the kind of indecent person who would try and make ` revenge porn ' that would have been going to lengths to avoid identification in doing so even without this law . 
  i think probably the law should just be that publishing photos of any person that might require their consent must be done with identifiable information about the publisher , with isps and hosters required to block access/take down the photo of a request to see the identified person results in a dead end/no party that obtained consent/didn ' t come with proper id . 
  putting the responsibility on , essentially , exactly the sort of jerk that * would * make revenge porn is going to do nothing . 
   an opinion ca n't be wrong . 
  you can disagree but you ca n't say it 's wrong when it 's their choice . 
  ... well ... not the * best * foundation for an argument against a person saying fines for opinions are objectionable on principle you could 've had . 
  just saying . 
  the chinese may not like you , but the republic also recognizes the federation has exceptional value to its own pursuit of long term stability and lack of policy challenge at the unsc with its own veto . 
  the french and british are never going to fuck with a us agenda . 
  i ca n't even imagine a scenario where us and british interests are somehow * antagonistically * at odds . 
  i wo n't say anything about the french because those jokes are overdone and inaccurate , but they came back to nato 's unified nuclear command in 2009 for a reason . 
  but russia does n't have to play ball with america . 
  russia does n't need to take america 's shit , because the europeans * still * are n't willing to go whole hog on the sanctions our state department wants . 
  the sanctions the us wants to push for are the ones that would make living in st. petersburg uncomfortable , make living in moscow like it 's the 90s again , and make living in ufa like stalin 's era , so that russian industry and the wealthy who control it would be severely threatened , and so that the common person would start having to make ever more painful choices about clothes , education , antibiotics , transport etc. 
  to stir dissent . 
  the europeans wo n't accept the sanction schedule or depth the us wants , because from smaller ( and nato ) nations like estonia that fear the federation the most , to huge wealthy ones like germany , their ability to act independently in a martial sense ( estonia ) is simply not there , or else their ability to ignore fuel economics ( germany ) is not there . 
  ** i do not mean to say the russians and chinese are butt buddies , like the us and canada ** but , china recognizes this aspect of russia , in a way i think too few europeans do , and it 's reflected in their policy .
