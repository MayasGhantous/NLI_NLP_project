  russia is n't an economic world power in the sense that the united states or china or japan are economic world powers . 
  they 're an economic world power in the sense that their economy 's performance ( which is * largely * oil and gas concerns and related industries ) and its administration ( which is greatly politicized ) exerts * significant * economic and political control over many other powerful polities and groups . 
  the united states ' armed forces , those of the united kingdom , france , germany , greece , estonia , etc. 
  nearly the entire gamut of the eu as well as the usa , is entirely arrayed in nato ** solely ** because of russia , and not just because they have nukes and abuse ukraine . 
   also germany is getting about a third of its gas from russia aswell precisely . 
  essentially a third of germany 's economy and civil infrastructure * only has energy if russia allows it * while a shutoff situation would cripple them as well , it means a * massive * portion of germany political and military and economic calculus must be pro-russian or at least give significant deference to russian political interests . 
  when 1/3 of germany 's gas comes from rosneft , from gazprom , from lukoil , etc. 
  that means what the german voter might consider sovereign , or else eu energy policy ** actually ** has to involve the unappointed apparatchik 's of the kremlin nestled within the russian federation 's energy sector , ** actually ** has to involve nato defense planning which operates on the understanding that moscow 's defense planning sees the strategic value of energy as well , etc. 
  russia is n't an economic or military power in the way other nations are , but it is * definitely * an undeniable one , and in many ways , exerts influence over events that have little pushback . 
  russian standards of living outside moscow and st.petersburg in the hamlets and villages and distant oblasts , and the quasi-soviets allied to the federation are * far * below that of the western europeans who think sanctions do n't have to be that severe to change the average russian person 's political opinions of putin , for instance . 
  they are fundamentally a resilient , proud , and strong people with a polity whose economic and military position reflects that , and they should not be underestimated or ignored . 
   economocially russia is not a world power after all most things that comes from russia are oil or gas ** oh look , a german telling us russia is n't a world power because all they have is oil and gas . 
  ** tell it to the poles . 
  yes , and anyone telling you otherwise is dangerously foolish - do n't elect them to public office . 
  things russia has : 1 ) a seat on the unsc 2 ) nuclear weapons 3 ) the support/cooperation/open relations with and of : -- iran -- syria -- china/north korea 4 ) strong diplomatic and trade relations with china , also a unsc power , also a nuclear power 5 ) the second largest arms export industry in the world , to countries in the western and eastern hemispheres ; plenty of latin american nations , and india ( a nuclear power as well ) 6 ) a quarter to a third of the entire european union gas market , being over 50 % of the heating and industrial ( gas ) usage of most of its members _____________________________________ ( a ) go find any nation with an economic situation like their current one ... . ( b ) ... which is also a nuclear power , also a massive exporter of arms , also has deep diplomatic and military ties to the second largest economy and rival of the us called china , military and economic ties to india , and which also is an undisputed and irreplaceable ( for now ) component of european energy needs , directly responsible for many nato partners functioning economies and civil population 's ability to have energy . 
  a : you 'll be able to make all sorts of arguments for them not being a key world power b : and then hopefully you 'll see why you ca n't simply equate them with russia because of their economic situations being similar . 
  immigration issues are just cultural issues , and culture dictates policy choices . 
  this post is about culture and policy choices . 
  immigration - outside of economic realities - really only has any relevance as an issue because of culture and subsequent policy choices . 
  i 'm not turning anything into anything . 
  a sorry result - but these are europeans practicing democracy as a sovereign people making their own policy for their own country . 
  the same leftists that will lament this result ( as do i ) , * also * maintain that there is no reason to fear and reject mass migration of peoples even further removed from common european mores . 
   the only difference would be the sleeping quarters and shower areas . 
  so each time a patrol goes out for days on end with sporadic fighting , they 're going to build shower areas and sex segregated quarters ? 
   so you have to admit that the test is n't valid . 
  no , if your claim is `` oh , the initial selection was n't stringent enough , they let too many unfit women through ! '', 
  i am simply reminding you that the standards had to be dropped in order to even have 100 women volunteers . 
   i 'm not advocating a 50:50 gender proportion in the military , but just admit woman to the same selection progress as man have . 
  almost none will pass selection . 
   that very few will be on par to the average male soldier . 
  no , because they 've already done this in the us marines . 
  when they did what you 're talking about , not a single woman met standards of completion . 
   physical and psychological tests should be the determining factors in the admission , not the gender . 
  physical and psychological tests applied the same way weed out most men , leaving only those who were conditioned beyond average , and weed out all women . 
  there are fundamental differences in the physicality and psychology of the genders that means military requirements of physicality and psychology largely exclude women as is . 
  the military - - ones that actually have infantry operations , not like italy , but indeed like the british - - furthermore , does n't wish to deal with the logistical and training problem of trying to accommodate special cases of those * very * few women who can meet basic standards , while they 're trying to meet a program demand for large scale , uniform capability soldiers to be assigned without logistical issues further down the road . 
   so neither italy , nor almost any other nato member ( except for the uk , usa and france ) participate in sustained combat regularly . 
  absolutely . 
   it just does n't seem like a noteworthy piece of information to say `` yeah , but italy does n't do x '' when most the rest of the world does n't do `` x '' either . 
  yes it does . 
  as you said :  except for the uk , usa and france this is a story about the british military . 
  this is * exactly * the point i 'm making . 
  that other guy bringing up the italian military is bringing up an irrelevant point . 
  the italians simply do not do what the british military often does ; that women being integrated into the force did n't harm their effectiveness is irrelevant . 
  that 's what i was pointing out . 
  it 's not even about women or anything - - this is whether or not people pay attention to the basics of policy they 're analyzing when news stories about what their country does come out . 
   there have been no decrease in effectiveness caused by having them in combat roles . 
  ^ this is meaningless . 
  italy 's armed forces do n't really have combat roles performed by large infantry operations . 
  they have token participation in nato missions as air and naval support , and soft-peacekeeping , much like all others . 
  women being jet pilots , naval crew , and logistics personnel is n't an issue at all . 
  women are perfectly capable of being * just * as good at flying a fight jet . 
  no one is worried about that . 
  combat infantry and combat arms jobs is the issue , and that 's where people are worried standards will drop because lives are really on the line there - - - italy does n't do that . 
  saying that women have n't compromised anything means nothing because italy does n't have a military which does the combat operations people are talking about . 
   this shows that they were too lax in the initial selection . 
  that was so they could have women to show up . 
  if they kept standards just as high in the initial selection , they would n't have had 100 volunteers who were female that could make it . 
  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/19/marine-corps-weighs-lower-standards-for-women-afte/?page=all http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/the-cost-of-lower-standards-for-women-in-marine-recruitment/?_r=0 * most men , including almost all the men on the internet talking about this * including me are * entirely unfit * for combat . 
  unless someone is capable of staying awake for about two days , carrying 80 to 100 pounds of ammunition , communications equipment , body armor , and food , being able to * sprint * with it , * jump * with it , and * swim * with most of it , able to carry a 7 to 10 pound rifle which they can bring up from rest to an extended position over and and over again , keep alert enough to watch for enemy , and have the * desire * and * willingness * to * kill * on command , repeatedly , the ability to keep calm as people around them are ripped open by bullets and shrapnel , and the ability to do this all for * months * at a time over a period of years , they have * no business whatsoever * being infantry . 
  the point of a soldier is to have a physically fit person who is able to effectively * kill as many other people who do not cooperate with a nation 's political objectives and who resist with force * . 
  that 's it . 
  it 's not about anything else but that , and * most * men , including me , without severe programs - months worth - of forced physical labor , psychological indoctrination and mental stamina conditioning , and extensive testing , are * completely useless * because their bodies are simply not at all prepared . 
  many are so unfit they ca n't even be accepted for training on the schedule required , and even then some can not pass - - - purely because of their physiques not being good enough . 
  * good enough * physiques become like that because of the male body 's production of testosterone , which has significant impact on bone density , muscle gain , vo2 max , and other metabolic processes which ultimately turn into how quickly you can run with with up to 100 pounds of gear , how alert you can stay without food and sleep , how willing you will be to kill without hesitation , how well you will handle stress , etc. 
  biology is n't going to change . 
  only standards and our politics will , and it will mean the compromise of fighting forces that have to operate at scale , over long periods of time . 
  italy also [ does n't get involved ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_italy#italian_republic ) in actual sustained combat operations where its troops are in the business of war in significant numbers . 
  there were 102,995 soldiers in the entire italian armed forces in 2014 . 
  even assuming * all * of them are the absolute tip of the spear special operations soldiers , that 's a grand : 8239 female combat troops who are n't support , logistics , security , intelligence , transport , medical staff , etc. 
  the actual number is going to be massively lower , and the actual martial responsibilities of italy are simply not there . 
  almost all european nato nations have seen * no * sustained heavy infantry combat , which is precisely the kind of situation wherein * most men * are completely unfit without significant strength and endurance training . 
  the notion that women will be introduced into this capacity without standards being lowered is nothing but political correctness . 
  i would n't go that far . 
  turkey ( along with greece , which i find humorous ) was one of the first nato expansion nations precisely because though they 're `` europeanish '' that status is a function of their geography . 
  they 're * ridiculously * well placed - [ i mean , excluding china for the moment ] ( https://worldsbestdives.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/turkey_political.png ) - look at that shit . 
  they 're right in between the two biggest us theaters ; the middle east and russia . 
  even before we wanted the jupiter class nukebirds there and even * after * the cuban missile crisis , it 's just * such * a prime staging ground for all kinds of operations ; aircraft sorties in long range bombing , scrambling interceptor aircraft , a staging ground for troops , a refueling/supplies point . 
  it 's just so defensible , and yet right in the middle of it all . 
  on top of that : [ look at how many troops they have ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tprsm6e.png ) unlike almost * every * other nato ally ( besides the very small ones - like estonia , actually ) , they actually have a sizeable number of troops to go along with their modern equipment . 
  turkey can get away with what it did , it 's a lynchpin of nato . 
  i 'm not sure estonia would fare so well if they went off the reservation and picked a fight with the russians that was n't * hugely * obviously a case of self-defense , so they could invoke art. 5, 
  before apologists start saying `` but russia is the biggest trade and energy partner of ______ , not poland or _____ ! '', 
  well , that 's precisely the problem , is n't it ? 
  that there are no concrete steps being taken by european polities to do business elsewhere , within the eu , to the benefit of their political union allies , as opposed to russia ? 
  have you noticed an increase in domestically produced equivalents or is it just slow restocking ? 
  are foreign brands harder to find in your opinion , than previously ? 
  also , beyond dixy , have you noticed any really big changes of availability or price in open air markets or stalls ? 
  not a really an exhaustive survey , i just do n't get to ask these questions nearly as often as i 'd like haha, 
  not at all !, 
  i ask my russian friends ( st. pete , moscow , and ufa ) the same question regularly , in detail - gas prices , food availability , how often people in their friend groups ( mid 20s early 30s ) are going out to eat , etc. 
  informal query of a casual interest in how the broad policy sanctions are actually manifesting ` on the ground ' , is all . 
  i 'd do phone surveys , but ja ne govoryu ochen horosho y i do n't think i 'd be able to reach many people with how my long distance gets billed ... 
  i think you 're right . 
  it 's why i believe nato expansion is so crucial , but so frustrating . 
  the single framework in which almost all ` european ' and near european powers cooperate is ultimately nato - not the eu , eurozone , schengen , etc. 
  for instance : greece and turkey , greece and germany , poland and germany , spain , portugal and the baltics , the uk and romania - - you get these linkages * really * only when you consider them in the nato spectrum , which really overrides what are otherwise antagonistic , non-existing , apathetic , or really unequal arrangements . 
  i hope europe takes up the slack , because there really should n't be this much determination of the fate of the european project or whatever the identity will be by us defense planners . 
  no worries , no one minds you asked for a source - you have one now , though . 
  how 's the supermarket situation where you are , btw ?
