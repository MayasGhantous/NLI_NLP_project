  ** the basic physical reality of reproduction _ is _ the union of two separate components into a single whole ** it * is * a loss of ` autonomy ' . 
  `` autonomy '' comes from `` auto '' `` nomos '' - - self law there * ceases * to be * separate * selves with reproduction , and another is introduced . 
  m + f = baby , and then there are three , not two humans . 
  that 's literally what 's happening dude . 
   that baby exists within the mother without her consent . 
  how did it get there ? 
  it did n't invade her like an infestation . 
  the baby did n't choose those circumstances at all . 
   it does n't matter how long it 's been inside the mother , humans do not have the right to feed off the bodies of other humans . 
  it 's not a parasite !, 
  and would you say a newborn human baby has no right to be fed ? 
  has no right to anyone 's milk or even a bottle of formula ? 
  it should just , having come into the world moments ago , go get a job ? 
   they do have the right to defend their bodies however . 
  the baby has literally no means of defense . 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
   no , it is n't . 
  it 's a cell clump , perhaps vaguely in the shape of a human a cell clump with a complete genome , a genome which is currently coding for proteins that build the cell walls that give it that shape and which will months from then give it all sorts of other tissues , making the baby grow its first set of teeth down from the bridge through the gums , and decades later make its hair start to become white , etc. 
   in that case you get the funny consequences that going to the barber is mutilation , and freezing a fertilized egg should be illegal as putting children in solitary confinement for an indefinite period is illegal . 
  now , you 're conflating differentiated non-germline cells with diploid condition , haploid germline cells , and macroscopic multicellular organisms with individual tissue cells . 
  also , on this count * i see nothing * but constant opposition from the same social quarters which are forgiving of abortion , when it comes to sex selective abortion of female children to be in developing countries like china and india . 
  suddenly it 's not `` just a clump of cells '' . 
  why ? 
  when the glycoproteins of the spermhead and those of the zona pellucida meet , within moments the acrosin-acrosomal reaction happens and within moments of that , the transcription and translation of a * new human genome * that will be determining everything from eye color to skin color to lactase persistence and how well the person handles icecream and whether they could be a daddy or a mommy and whether they can donate blood to people or not etc. 
  is all being determined by the combination of alleles from the sperm and egg which turn into a developing human and cease being separate germ line cells . 
  why * is n't * it acceptable to think life begins at conception ? 
   so is the mother . 
  sure - - though , kind of not the ` mother ' when she is n't the mother - the woman is absolutely a human with rights , to her own body . 
  * but * i 'd wager an adult human has much less precedence in terms of protection in the minds of pro-choice people than a little innocent baby , and when someone 's autonomy over their own body means * killing * another human ? 
  we ( almost all civilized societies ) have neglect laws that punish people who abandon their kids and fail to fulfill their duties to babies - everything from not feeding and clothing them , to psychologically hurting them or even hitting them . 
  we view it , rightfully , as abusive and criminal for a `` parent '' to hit their child repeatedly , for them to humiliate and verbally abuse the child , for them to deprive it of food far beyond encouraging a diet but as punishment , to leave them unclothed and physically vulnerable , etc. 
  we do this , even though * not * doing those things requires of an adult parent to prioritize the child in their lives ; something plenty of them are more than happy to do without the law , but the laws exist because of what sometimes happens and our societies desire to intervene in that . 
  prolife people view notions of `` bodily autonomy '' allowing ` mothers ' to abort developing human juveniles which are n't at any health risk and which will as the pregnancy turns to a birth , become babies , in this same light . 
  they simply see elective abortion outside of extenuating medical/psychological circumstances to be tantamount to murder . 
   countries where abortion is legal have a time limit for `` elective '' abortion , usually based on viability . 
  right but viability is * variable !, 
  * if you say viability is at 22 weeks , that 's * on average * . 
  furthermore , it 's from an * estimated * point of conception !, 
  no one gets a running timestamp on their belly showing when they were impregnated and how long its been and * also * what cell differentiation and subsequent tissue development and subsequent viability outside the womb is assured . 
  it just does n't work like that , and pro life people do n't really find it a persuasive argument that human rights are a function of an estimated number of business days . 
  i mean , it 's not ` dumb and ignorant ' . 
  fundamentally , a fetus is n't an alien or a different species or an infection . 
  it 's a developing human . 
  it is * human * . 
  you were a fetus , i was a fetus , angela merkel was a fetus , etc. 
  there 's continual development from the moment an independent human genome exists to the day our bodies die - so it 's kind of contentious as to when the `` life '' starts , and fully realized conscious experiential existence is * sort of ambiguous * i 'd reckon most people would consider a 9 month old developing human an hour before delivery while contractions are starting to be a baby not a `` fetus '' . 
  keep going back by hours and days ( or hell , back from when it 's out the womb ) : when does it lose its right to exist ? 
  when does it turn into a `` non living unbaby just a fetus '' ? 
  or whatever ? 
  it 's not ignorance/stupidity that motivated pro life people to want elective abortions ( outside the case of rape/abuse ) to be illegal - it 's that they * legitimately * believe that because it 's a human being , you ca n't simply kill it for convenience . 
  that 's a matter of values , and that 's why ireland has the laws it does . 
  i suspect it 'll change faster than within a generation , but i do n't see why we necessarily have to label people who are pro-life anti women sex haters who are dumb/ignorant . 
  americans on the internet knowing they have a european audience will generally dick swing about the military , the other way around , about social services . 
  when neither side has the other , the dick swinging is about things like local sports rivalries . 
  more angular . 
  [ lamborghini miura ] ( http://trueautosite.com/wp-content/uploads/images/lamborghini-miura_3714.jpg ) [ lamborghini reventon ] ( http://trueautosite.com/wp-content/uploads/lamborghini-reventon_3734.jpg ) i 'm pretty sure the design cues in sports cars * follow * those of aerodynamics and aesthetics you can mimic from aviation , and it 's not like the designers were saying `` hey , let 's make our next planes look badass ! '', 
  but it 's pretty much the angular stuff . 
  that and the stealth coating/panels are always being replaced and the color changes so it looks even more jagged . 
  [ this phenomenon was hilariously played out during the * occupy * protests in the us ] ( http://www.brennerbrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wants-big-government-liz-nichols-occupy-portland-pepper-spray1.jpg ) none of them seemed to have turned out to vote in 2014 . 
   who said anything about lawful or unlawful ? 
  the final result is 10,000 people killed by guns . 
  oh , that 's how it is ? 
  http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm overuse , , drunk driving , domestic abuse - - a range of criminality and abusive alcohol behavior has a final result of over 8 times as many deaths in the us per year . 
  time to start banning high content alcohol and sixpacks !!, 
  ! 111 the * overwhelming * majority of the nearly 1/3rd of the us population , 100 million people , who own guns , are part of a centuries long tradition in the us of not fucking with anyone , while owning guns . 
  i see no reason to impede them because criminals commit crimes , any more than i can look at date rapists and drunk drivers and start morally interrogating the right the average person to enjoy a pint . 
   maybe you think it 's worth nearly 10,000 murders by firearm in one year to have guns about 100 million people in the us own about 300 million firearms . 
  go ahead and assume ( overassuming ) that 10,000 murders are committed by 10,000 lawful people owning 10,000 firearms . 
  go ahead and do that fraction of 10,000 firearms in crime by 300 million , multiply by 100 - look at the percent . 
  i have a percent in mind for when i 'd consider it reasonable to lump in the law abiding majority with the criminal minority , and it 's larger than one percent , i 'm just saying . 
   what is the purpose of encryption ? 
  to enable secure communication between individuals , but people can use it with criminal intent . 
   what is the purpose of a data storage device ? 
  to store data , but people can use it with criminal intent . 
   what is the purpose of a modem ? 
  to enable internet connection , but people can use it with criminal intent . 
   what is the purpose of a car ? 
  to decrease time spent travelling , but people can use it with criminal intent . 
   what is the purpose of a gun ? 
  to make an individual capable of inflicting lethal force , but people can use it with criminal intent . 
  an individual killing an animal or another individual person is simply not inherently criminal . 
   at best , it is either to be used as a hunting weapon our second amendment is n't about hunting at all . 
   to deter harm by implication of lethal force no , or to stop harm by application of lethal force . 
   its purpose is still harmful . 
  killing a criminal who wishes to inflict harm on my family or intrudes in my home is not harmful . 
   however , trying to paint guns as everyday utensils is , at best , faulty logic . 
  fire extinguishers are n't every day utensils either . 
  you 're waffling between three different arguments and making none of them exceptionally well . 
   americans using their guns to take down their government `` if it gets uppity '' has been an illusion for at least seven decades now . 
  that was never the only point of the amendment . 
  ** that the worst case scenario of the 1st amendment is n't invoked does n't mean it is n't necessary . 
  ** that no one has to go around talking about how we should n't have anal probes at airports and the bedroom cameras are a bit much , does n't mean there is n't a case for keeping harddrives private , or that there 's is n't a utility for encrypting emails . 
  firstly ; way to move the goal posts secondly ; encryption and internet anonymity and tools of mass communication and software control ** can ** be abused . 
  absolutely they can be abused . 
  but the argument `` well guns can kill people so common people must be restricted because of criminal action '' is like the argument `` well harddrives and modems can be used to spread child pornography so common people must be restricted because of criminal action '' fuck yeah , guns can kill people . 
  why do you think governments across the world want to be sure * they 're * the ones with the guns and none of their own people over and over and over again ? 
  why do you think governments get worried when other governments have more people with guns nearby or better ` guns ' of some kind ? 
  you 're basically saying : `` hey , this this is * powerful * so it should be in the hands of the few , not the many ! '', 
  which is precisely same `` oh , give up your liberties and freedoms for * security !!, 
  ! 11 * '' argument that gets trotted out for encryption and guns and everything else in my country , your country , and all countries by elites who want to be sure the rabble are not too powerful .
