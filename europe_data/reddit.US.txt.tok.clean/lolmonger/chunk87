   it 's saying `` let 's ban guns '' `` because if common people can buy these too easily , terrorists and criminals * among the common people * will get them and do terrible things with their newfound capacity for bad things ! '', 
  , is the argument . 
  it is * precisely * the same argument as : `` let 's ban encryption '' or `` let 's not have too much privacy on the internet '' ... `` for the common people of our society , because there are terrorists hiding among us and the government should know what they 're up to , so it needs to know what you 're * all * up to , and this is how we have to live , okay ? 
  it 's for your own good ! '', 
  ________________ it 's the same argument , every time - - give the government a little more power to prevent bad things . 
  and in almost every instance , it 's on the same lines : a little more of your speech powers , a little more of your privacy , some more of what firearms you can own , a little more of your rights to expedited trials/no detention without cause , etc. 
  it 's the same shit , over and over again , and each time , the government will find some group of people they 're supposed to be protecting us from whom ** they are n't ** stopping , and hold them up and say `` well , looks like you have n't bent over enough '' _______________ also :  let 's ban guns '' , which makes perfect sense in the uk fucking why ? 
  look over the history of gun laws in the uk look at what the english upper class 's anxieties were about the irish , about the ` lower classes ' . 
  look at the * proliferation * of firearms in the united kingdom ( like the one that existed after the act of union ) when the technology was sufficient to produce them , and how common they were to the people . 
  was it really fears about widespread common * criminality * that motivated the permits and then the bans ? 
  or is it something else powerful men fear when they want to be sure none of the rabble are armed ? 
   i like to think of it this way : by making legal guns harder to obtain illegal arms will rise in price . 
  1 ) illegally bought firearms are already in a totally different supply channel , here and in the us 2 ) from low quality : http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/sub-machine-gun-seized-from-gang-raid/story-fnhocxo3-1226659401117 to very high quality : http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2015/08/11/mystery-9mm-machine-pistol-seized-europe/ criminals will make their own and sell them across continents if there 's money to be made . 
   just look around for ( illegal ) weapon costs in the us vs canada . 
  illegally obtained firearms are super cheap in the us . 
   http://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2014/08/12/inside-the-black-market-for-guns/ by banning almost all guns , and making people pay 400 dollars for permits and 90 dollars for finger printing fees for just ownership ( forget carry ) , nyc has made precisely zero impact on the sale and trade ( the illegal sale and trade ) of firearms . 
  criminals who do n't care about the value of life , whatever their persuasion , and who do care about money , will simply continue to do crazy shit , and decent people will be without arms . 
  it 's exactly the same impulse as politicians calling for increased surveillance over and over and over again - - no more encryption , stored internet activity , registered real names to online handles , etc. 
  it 's all meant to make the common people as powerless and as materially subservient as possible . 
  their massive powers of surveillance keep failing to prevent terrorist attacks , and their claim is that * with a little more power * and us having * a little less privacy * , we 'll be * safer * - and is n't * more safety * a * good thing ? 
  * freedom is too dangerous for the common people !,

  that 's the thing , though - nations with absurd hate speech laws that bother to codify anything but the extremes of speech that incites violence or is purely obscene as being less than 100 % legal are * also * generally the sort of nations that have * no * backbone when it comes to dealing with forces that extort justice and exploit the law in their favor as a perpetually opppressed and thus by compensatory action - an empowered group . 
  britain does n't really have freedom of speech by us standards - they lock people up for writing inane things on twitter . 
  yet they 're * also * unable to look at what went on in rotherham and be like `` tally ho , lads !, 
  some child buggery for us to sort out !, 
  call the constables ! '', 
  or whatever because the same cloying overwrought notions of needing to coddle and protect through over control that induced laws criminalizing twitter utterances also made the prospect of large scale police action focusing on a group of people of a specific racial/religious background `` problematic '' . 
  switzerland * does * have a singular language ; almost every single swiss is native or fluent in swiss german , a large native french speaking population ( who though they speak french at home will be able to speak german ) , and smaller italian ( at home ) and english ( at home ) communities . 
  very much like the us , wherein it 'd be possible to say `` oh yah , half of everyone only speaks spanish and sometimes hindi or mandarin '' , but * really * : it 's english . 
  furthermore , you quoted that sentence without the qualifier of * large * . 
  * even more importantly * the public and private culture of german swiss speaking swiss people and italian-first speaking swiss people , etc. 
  is by and large * identical * with token variation . 
  * this is not the case for the great majority of fundamentalist muslim populations who immigrate when you compare the degree of fit between them and their host nations * if you ca n't see that because my speaking in generalities about the nature of stable nations ( which , i would * greatly * contend is actually at work in switzerland , too ) does n't conform to whatever percentage of primary language speaker distribution you might find in europe , then i do n't know what to say to you my polish friend , other than that there 's a reason the russians tried banning your language in the 1800s . 
  a people are their shared language , history and * culture * - how they talk about things , what they 've gone through , and how and why they do things . 
  they should jealously guard their nations and formal states , because that preserves their people ; their language , culture , and history . 
  the greatest wealth man can have is his own people , his own family , his own countrymen - kept healthy and strong and safe and prosperous through his individual effort and returned to him by their successes . 
  and it is . 
  choice or not , male coercion or not , it is fundamentally a sartorial choice meant to perform the values of qu ` ranic female sexual conservatism and obedience to the sunnah and acceptance of islam and allah swt and his messenger pbuh . 
  that means it is inherently a rejection of progressive sexuality ( which , can * also * exist as a result of male pressuring and coercion , despite rhetoric implying that all female moves away from conservatism and toward promiscuity are materially and motivated by ` liberation ' ) any muslim making the argument that their fundamentalism is fundamentalism is 100 % perfectly correct and not breaking ground in the least . 
  the issue comes up wherein they then also occasionally act * stunned * that after so often proclaiming and enacting their desire to have , on religious and cultural grounds , separate community standards of food , dress , political choice , and sexuality ... sometimes broader native communities in the west * do n't think they 'll be a good fit and their numbers of entry limited * if they 're not going to assimilate . 
  i find trump 's notions of religious tests for immigration offensive to the 1a , but community can not exist without unity around some grounds , and large stable , productive nations do n't exist without singular language , core political values , and culture . 
  the us is already running into huge issues over issues as our urban and rural split deepens , language as we have more and more illegal origin/mass latino immigrant communities continue to live in parallel en espa\u00f1ol , and as policy priority fights make budgets impossible federally until we 're right down to the wire . 
  the eu , even when it was a smaller number of closer , and more western nations , had problems and not it 's nearly totally dysfunctional on the big issues . 
  the great majority of * deeply * religious and foreign raised or recent immigration majority muslims who are such not only have the issues of political priority and national identity , but often language barriers and even basic social and sexual values out of sync with the west . 
  it does n't actually matter which one is right or not - the lack of fit is what determines discord , and until everyone is willing to step back and admit that you ca n't have unity * without unity * there 'll continue to be problems . 
  ______________ edit : i should point out also , that the us has gotten pretty lucky in this regards ; our muslims are * our * people ; they 're * americans * - they serve in our congress and military , they 're our musicians and clerks and professors , etc. 
  they assimilated . 
  yeah , it 's true , occasionally there 's an al-awlaki , but that 's the exception . 
  [ the economist has a great article on assimilation in the us of muslim people ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21615611-why-muslims-fare-better-america-europe-islamic-yet-integrated ) assimilation matters - it 's happened in europe ( in poland from like , the 1400s with the tatars ) , it can happen again ; assimilation does n't mean the destruction of private religious and cultural norms - it means the adoption of public ones as part of union with the broader community . 
  no one sided simplification of issues masquerading as satire and just education . 
   for the long term effects , it depends on what share of the refugees we are able to retrain , educate and get into work . 
  there is a lot of work in front of us . 
  there 's near 100 percent german employment , perfect labor to capital fit , and ability to have families , right ? 
  with excess school capacity and unfilled job postings , right ? 
  hitler also had thousands of armed goons , and a post-war population of millions far more desperate than any europeans today , and a military apparatus that was like `` hey , we ca n't kill all of these people with bullets - - let 's gas and cremate them in death factories ! '', 
  i mean , a little bit different . 
   ( better than their estonian usually ) . 
  jeez , really ? 
  oh , but , that sort of thing is clear , too , and * just * as useful to see as the different between leftwing poles on reddit , and the reality of mostly rightwing poland . 
  it 's like how * anyone * with a smidgen of self-awareness as a us national ( left or right ) should be able to look at / r/politics 's upvoted headlines and look at the news stories they 're complaining about and realize `` oh , the electorate in america is * not * this left of center as / r/politics would have me believe '' there 's a well known painting technique a lot of renaissance painters developed ; chiaroscuro - where they 'd use * reaaaaaaally * dark blacks right up against very light paint in order to create super defined shadows . 
  you can * know * that a face is shaped a certain way , and you can paint it like that ... or you can only paint * part * of it , and deliberately removing information , somehow give the impression of what 's * not * there , too !, 
  / r/worldnews is just complete garbage sometimes , and partially garbage all else . 
  it 's just way better being able to click on an in-depth/at least not totally superficial story about the particulars of a european nation 's policy , see it get contrasted with others of similar or dissimilar culture in europe , by people of those countries , and build notions about the different political cultures in each one based on what users from those nations say . 
  obviously , it takes * some * attentiveness to not get waylaid - - - the polish nationals who post here are * clearly * more left of center than are most polish people - - - - - - but that 's a fact that 's evident if you pay attention to the news stories and commentary by them about poland , for instance . 
  it 's just a great way to stay informed and also have some kind of cultural pulse about many different areas , and gain perspective on political issues in the us . 
  / r/europe is a lot like how i wish / r/worldnews were about european news and the like . 
  ** yes ** and that 's why european nations should invest heavily in natalist policies so that their own youth are marrying , starting families , and finding the material support they need to be the perpetuators of those nation 's language and culture , in addition to being the next workforce and taxbase . 
   guarantees of no violation of their territory ? 
  those are worthless no matter how strong . 
  instead of negotiating for `` and no one will violate ukrainian sovereignty '' , they should 've argued for `` immediate and complete economic sanctions of russia 's energy sectors by these european nations if russia invades , until it leaves our territory ''  ukraine needed a nuclear arsenal to ensure they 'd be left alone and unfortunately , they bargained it away . 
  i agree . 
   post cold war ukraine may not have been able to secure those nukes either - so maybe it 's for the best ? 
  if the pakistanis can do it ... 
   ukraine had no way to maintain that arsenal . 
  they did n't have the money whatsoever , and the facilities and equipment they had were n't going to cut it for long . 
  what 's your source for this bold assertion ? 
  they easily could 've retained ** some ** of their nuclear arsenal , even if it was just a small , small portion of less sophisticated arms inherited from their part of the soviet . 
  the whole world , the us led world and the russian federation , pounced on them because they were , all of a sudden , a small player with * the third largest arsenal * . 
   keeping the nukes would have done no good nonsense why should pakistan keep nukes , then ? 
  the real issue was that with the breakup of the soviet union , a lot of disarray in terms of * which soldiers belonged to whom * was at hand . 
  were the signals intelligence officers , nuke technicians , and perimeter security forces wearing soviet uniforms in a defunct command and control architecture now ukrainian troops ? 
  or russian federation soldiers . 
  the negotiations were held quickly because no one wanted ukraine , russia , and the west going to war over an unsecured arsenal , and ukraine frankly , should 've negotiated for much stronger guarantees of non-violation of its territory and tried to secure some nuclear capability for itself . 
  i do n't understand why people do n't get this : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/07/afghanistan.terrorism15 like , these people have ** never ** been subtle . 
  we are infidels , we are an insult to allah swt , we collaborate with israel , we kill muslims , and therefore we are to be destroyed and humiliated by the servants of god and his messenger muhammad pbuh . 
  it 's * never * a different message . 
  i do n't know . 
  i really do n't know . 
  my suspicion and my fear , is that the west has to go to war as the west , in the same way it used to call itself christendom , against the ummah , against islam , and do so without mercy , and force on muslims worldwide a reformation an enlightenment , just as christendom had after its constituent nations grew tired of murdering each other . 
  i hope that it is not the answer , and that integration and change from within will organically happen . 
  but look at india . 
  centuries on and integration has n't happened , and in fact , has worsened , with a new nation in religious opposition being created , attaining nuclear weapons !, 
  i do n't know the answer , and i hope the answer is much kinder than what history hints it is . 
  rating him on that . 
  it 's okay , but it 's not well done . 
   a nude human body is not something a child should see until he/she is 18 . 
  you made it way too obvious here . 
  and were skirting the line here :  so appropriateness for a child is the universal standard for judging acceptable art and media . 
  i give you 4/10,
