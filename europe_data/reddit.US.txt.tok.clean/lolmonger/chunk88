   do we really need dublin bombed too so gardai can act ? 
  this is , by the way , ** exactly ** the attitude people had about the us intelligence services post-9 / 11 `` well why did the fbi wait ? 
  why are n't we screening everyone 's purchases and movement in the country ? 
  ca n't we stop these people ? '', 
  and we got a lot of nightmarish surveillance that pre-9 / 11 , no one would 've thought passable ( and even expansions of stuff that existed before but was thought to be conspiratorial and which got a post-facto pass instead of scrutiny ! ), 
  i 'd say unchosen circumstances that leads to an untenable pregnancy ; from rape , to medical necessity , to sexual abuse , should see abortion permitted . 
  chosen circumstances that merely are n't satisfactory , however , do n't seem to themselves justify terminating a developing human organism . 
   i did n't consider the later stages of development because there should of course be a limit of x weeks from conception for abortion ( in case the mother 's life is n't at risk ) . 
  wait , why ? 
  there should be - * of course * - some kind of limit in the later stage of development ? 
  and what 's the stage ? 
  growth is * continuous * from the moment of conception where the transcription and translation of a new genome into cellular proteins starts , to an organism dying . 
  your imposition of :  2 to 4 months is measured by calendars , and these are processes that happen in miliseconds over decades from the moment of conception onwards . 
   that a mother should be the one to choose what to do of her body , at least on the embryo stage of development . 
  why not at every stage ? 
  hell , why not even after delivery , when the baby needs her milk ? 
   what if she 's not psychologically ready for the responsibility , or if she simply can not afford to take care of herself and another person without living a miserable life ? 
  and suppose a woman becomes this way * after * delivery ? 
  regardless of her partnership or marriage to a man ( who may or may not be the biological father ) ? 
  is a post-facto abortion okay then ? 
  or what if a month before her delivery , she 's informed she 's been laid off and * wo n't * be able to afford a baby a month later /  why put the life of a conglomerate of cells above one of a sentient being , only because the condom broke or she had sex for pleasure and not for reproduction ? 
  so , you agree , that the vast majority of arguments for elective abortion basically stem from :  she had sex for pleasure and not for reproduction ? 
  right ? 
  because where you ask :  why put the life of a conglomerate of cells above one of a sentient being i see : `` why do you put the life of * the only way humans become sentient beings by developing from cells * , above pleasure ? '', 
  basically , the overwhelming majority of arguments for elective abortion boil down to `` but girls just wan na have fun ! '', 
  in the face of what abortion does ; which is kill a developing human being - - - - - as evidenced by all the avoidance of the issue of late term abortion , or pre-delivery abortion by its apologists . 
  i just do n't think a condom breaking or birth control failing is what merits killing a developing human being . 
   abortion should be legal for 3 reasons :  1 ) the technology exists  2 ) the technical ability exists  3 ) the demand has existed and always will exist . 
  k , how about child sex slaves ? 
   `` wait but morality * is * actually a thing we should encode into law and there are lines i draw just not on this issue but definitely that one ! '', 
  that 's such a useless non-answer , though . 
  what about the * later * stages of development ? 
  what about one hour before delivery ? 
  is it still part of a `` host organism '' ? 
  ( btw , invoking terminology meant to talk about different species non-mutalist reproductive strategies of parasite and host for the evolutionarily determined , * in * - species reproductive arrangement is pretty self serving ) is it only a baby when most of it is outside the vagina ? 
  i mean , pretty obviously , sex is how we get penises inside vaginas so that sperm from the male can go into the uterus of the female , fertilize and egg , so that it can develop inside her , and be pushed out . 
  the reproductive process is not symmetrical in terms of physical cost , risk , and our society has to deal with human male and female both being autonomous persons with consent to different things ( because they are now socially and technologically different/distinguishable things ) like just sex , or just pregnancy , or just marriage , or just parenthood , etc. 
  saying `` well , but it 's not a baby right after conception , ergo , abortion should be legal in all circumstances and that settles it ! '', 
  is such an un-nuanced , deliberately ignorant position to take . 
   the state has no right to tell me that i have to have a baby if i get pregnant does the state have a right to tell someone to pay for you and the baby if they get you pregnant and you choose to keep it ? 
  and if you unilaterally choosing to keep it or abort it is indeed 100 % your choice ... whence the responsibility of the male party to pay without * any * say in whether the baby is born or not ( let alone has custody ) ? 
  also , at what point does the state have * no * right to tell someone they 've got to have a baby if they 're pregnant ? 
  one hour before delivery ? 
  and what about one hour afterwards ? 
  what about two months prior ? 
  this is n't a simple , thought-less problem like : `` will our society ban using force to enter into a private dwelling by individuals seeking to abscond with property ? 
  '' , because i think we 're all pretty much on the same page about violent home-invasion and property theft being criminal things . 
  we 're not all on the same page about sex , the obligations of sex , what life is , when it begins , and what obligations that has and those policy battles are pretty fervent for a lot of reasonable reasons . 
  why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free ? 
   why do we have to pull our punches ? 
  because a full contact fight requires money , and europeans do n't want to spend that kind of cash . 
  i do hope you read the first and second sentences and second to last and last sentences i wrote . 
  because those were sort of `` the point '' and they bookend lots of examples and linked data substantiating them . 
  it 's sort of like - i guess i stated my belief , then addressed my basis for that belief , then restated it , clarifying it . 
  that 's not ... that 's not what honeypot specifically refers to ; i dunno if radical islamists are who you want to make anyone try and seduce , you know ? 
  mutual defense clauses without capacity are n't really mutual either . 
  finland is n't officially a nato partner , but they 're close , and france is . 
  [ this is raw nato spending ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8hmtu98.png ) [ this is how much of each economy gets spent on nato ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aqgkd9n.png ) [ here 's how much of each economy gets spent on nato ... compared to the time they 've been in the alliance , or been autonomous ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m9jnamb.png ) - - france , notably , peaced out for a bit from the unified command/nuclear architecture , then came back in . 
  de gaulle was trying some stuff out . 
  [ here 's that same data , but arranged in the rank order of those nations ascending to nato membership ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ug5ip8d.png ) it 's pretty clear what 's going on , right ? 
  older members , founding members , are n't pulling their weight . 
  [ percent of gdp going to nato obligations , and the time a nation joined nato ] ( http://i.imgur.com/57uthbv.png ) like , you can actually see which nations came into the alliance at the same time ( usually when their economies became sufficiently developed/politically autonomous ) as a group based on them doing ` just enough ' to join , and then never actually meeting obligations . 
  [ really , like , those are the actual groupings , beginning with greece and turkey ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1vorvpd.png ) [ here 's raw troop data ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tprsm6e.png ) again , the us basically * is * nato when you consider the percentages ( not here , a lot of that is n't publicly circulated for some reason ) of troops in country or deployed around the world . 
  [ here 's troops as a percentage of each nation 's labor force ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tmncbes.png ) greece is going balls to the walls with their ~ ~ jobs program ~ ~ definitely totally necessary force to defend everyone from turkey . 
  and the us is right behind ... * turkey * . 
  and europeans wonder why nato ca n't immediately take a hard line against the turks and their business with isis . 
  what happens to the alliance if they leave ? 
  then it 's * really * the us as the bankroll and barracks of the alliance . 
  [ again , look at troops as a percentage of the labor force risked , ranked by entry date into the alliance ] ( http://i.imgur.com/slwdopm.png ) again ; older nations are * not * pulling their weight , while newer entrants - - largely eastern european and former warsaw pact nations living right next to russia * really * hit above their weight . 
  croatia in particular is just really , really trying as a nato nation . 
  luxembourg does n't do shit . 
  [ here 's defense spending of each nation as the percentage contribution to the nato budget as a whole . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8rjypvw.png ) and here 's that data [ next to the percentage of their gdp they spend in order to * make * that percentage contribution to the nato budget . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jiupdgd.png ) again ; look at what 's going on . 
  it 's reasonable for the tiny nato nation of estonia to spend little in total , spend little ( 2 % gdp !, 
  the actual nato target ! ), 
  of its economy , and spend little relative to everyone else , and to the whole nato budget . 
  is it so reasonable they contribute a larger total share of the final nato budget than * freaking spain * ? 
  ** data ** : http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_107359.htm http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_topics/20140224_140224-pr2014-028-defence-exp.pdf http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs/countries/1w?display=default http://www.sipri.org/yearbook/2014/04 http://www.osce.org/library/14087 _____________________________________ europe is n't serious about defense . 
  it 's not serious about intelligence , it 's not serious about immigration policy , it 's not serious about energy independence . 
  the libya mission was * shameful * for nato 's larger non-us partners , particularly those who voted for it in the first place . 
  ** paperworks do n't matter ** treaties and organizations and alliances and committees and groups and unions do n't matter . 
  actual capability , and desire and will to use it in the defense and protection of oneself and ones friends is the only thing that matters , and europe does n't have it . 
   the mass hysteria the death of 130 persons caused . 
  yes , if he were watching people getting gunned down one by one as they screamed for their lives and in horror of their friends and family 's bodies lying in front of them , he 'd definitely be totally blase about the whole thing . 
  because the demographic decline of europe means the population base wo n't have enough cheaply employable workers or taxpayers for the social systems to work , so immigration by any means is required for the consumer economy to continue to function + it means a ready made base of people to vote for generations with loyalty to the parties which offered them a place in europe . 
  same deal with obama 's ` discretion ' in enforcing us immigration law being to affirmatively issue millions of social security numbers , and vow that all illegal immigrants will have as can be possible , a ` pathway to citizenship ' instead of just legal status . 
  got ta get those votes !, 
   who can possibly rule over the arabian peninsula that would be more sane ? 
  the princeling oligarchs are cunts and are our enemies ( well , my enemies ) , but is there any reason to think democracy would not put isis or something like it in power ? 
  so , the grand strategy the us pursued was the saudi kingdom keeping the sunnis in line , and the shah of iran keeping the shiites in line . 
  operation ajax and aramco were realpolitik at their finest . 
  and it worked , it worked really well , because through the post 1945 british withdrawal from their colonies , and the energy bounty that was the middle east , the russians did n't get the foothold beyond the bosporus they wanted , and the us got lots of energy . 
  it worked really well in the remainder of the 40s , 50s and 60s and 70s . 
  pan islamic nationalist movements of the kind that tried killing gamel nasser , that overthrew the ( admittedly brutal shah ) like the muslim brotherhood like the islamic revolutionary forces , threw all of that into chaos . 
  no more pan-arab nationalist secular parties , no more us backed strong men . 
  isis may very well turn into a sunni hezbollah once they infiltrate a proper state and get more money/some foreign sponsors defect into leadership and planning . 
  the basic problem is that the west never interacted with the arab world in a way that was n't exploitative , and the muslim world as a whole never had an enlightenment , a renaissance , a westphalia in the same way , and all of those chickens are coming home to roost with a pre - medieval death ideology and automatic weapons and explosives . 
  the tricky part is when that something is `` provide the energy resources that keeps the western world 's consumer economies and heavy industries going , so that global markets can be flush with cash and easy credit '' for instance . 
  how do you suppose the poles feel about nord stream 2 ?
