  how do you suppose ukrainians , ones so eager to join the european union , feel about germany and france looking at russia and basically saying `` well ... but ... oil pipelines ... and , hm , so , do we really not sell those mistrals ? '', 
  all the outrage - the justified outrage - that should be felt by americans and europeans and their governments ' endless tolerance of the gulf arabs for the energy they produce while our domestic capacity and research into alternatives is always in short supply ... ... that outrage was * sorely * lacking over ukraine . 
  frankly , i have so little faith in the european project and in nato i think that outrage will be lacking now . 
  none of our leaders ever made moves on turkey . 
  everyone knows what 's happening , and nothing is done . 
  you know why ? 
  same issue of dependence ; look at how much of the alliance 's troop strength and global position depends on turkey . 
  will european nations vastly step up their defense spending to eliminate that compromising feature of the alliance ? 
  will we in the us * really * start calling on politicians to pressure the saudis to stop funding radical wahabbist imams ? 
  will both europe and the us renew and increase funding and expansion of energy alternatives so our dealings with the middle east as a whole do n't see our lauded principles of western civilization compromised by the need for energy/credit flow ? 
  the response to the russians murdering their way across eastern ukraine was and is shameful - are ukrainians less european when they bleed out and die than french people ? 
  or does the paperwork of membership in the eu mean they were basically no more than the fraway foreigners isis kills ? 
  ** it 's easy ** to say in light of the cowardly and savage attacks against france that the gulf arab states and radical sunni islamist terrorism ideology is bad and all , but belling the cat is not so simple . 
  putting the bell on requires mettle , and expense , and i do not see a europe that when tested before has much in the way of collective martial ( ukraine crisis ) or economic interest ( greek crisis ) that results in a european people who can solve european issues . 
  this is kind of like when i resent dianne feinstein , the most liberal californian senator ever , coming to the us senate to tell everyone why federal gun control is needed like she has any business telling me what i can and ca n't do as a pennsylvanian . 
  but the people of the california republic who elected her did so to a federal legislature to which the commonwealth of pennsylvania is also subordinate - - namely , the united states of america . 
  ( and so far , federal courts have n't challenged the notion of federal legislatures abrogating the extent of the constitution 's protections outside of constitutional convention by means to taxation or other regulations ... ) so it 's not like anyone can go to the governor of our state ( who is also a liberal now , as it happens ) and hope that he wo n't enforce federal laws the president may sign . 
  the extent to which pennsylvania is not sovereign is n't the same as the extent to which croatia is n't sovereign - - you still have autonomy ( to an extent ) over your military , whereas the pa national guard is subordinate to the us defense department . 
  furthermore , while there are a lot of eu laws , most legal reality in croatia is decided by croatia , not union laws . 
  ** but only most ** - - not all , because croatia is not de jure entirely independent as a european union member , and de facto is under the thumb of brussels/berlin to a great extent . 
  this is literally what unions do , dude . 
   it was an attack against humanity as a whole , like obama said . 
  i have to take issue with what my president said , because once again he sounded like an empty suit . 
   this is an attack not just on paris , it 's an attack not just on the people of france , but * this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share . 
  * ** clearly not ` all of humanity ' subscribes to these ` universal values ' which were attacked ** and until the west 's intelligence services , militaries , politicians , and bodies politic are willing to commit to the work of social integration , national security , and actual response , nothing will change - - we ca n't even talk about the basic problem without hemming and hawing and hedging our bets for the sake of acceptance . 
  we 're too politically correct to get angry , let alone be productive in our anger . 
   we ( croatians ) did n't elect her and she has no authority here your elected officials * gave * her authority when you joined the eu . 
  croatia is n't an entirely independent nation , because its politics are in part , controlled to conform to things required of eu membership . 
  this is what political unions do . 
  it 's exactly the same mechanism that means the voters of sidraga who may have never met anyone from cetina and who have each chosen different local representation , are nonetheless all subordinate to zagreb 's national governance . 
  it 's only the degree of power and agreements of supremacy that determine the extent to which people are no longer independent when they join a union . 
  a husband and wife do n't live like single men and women , either , unless their marriage is only in name . 
  this is what unions do ; they can confer greater power and stability , but with the loss of independence . 
  each attacked the other in the way that mattered . 
  the us was an open society with a pervasive , competitive set of media outlets , and a vibrant civic and political life where dissent and contrarian viewpoints enjoyed protection to an extreme degree compared to the soviet union . 
  no national ids ( still ! ), 
  no border checks between states , people are friendly , etc - - the perfect target for moles , saboteurs , shit stirrers , sleeper agents . 
  so that 's what the kgb did . 
  ___________ on our side ; we had decades more advanced electronics , telemetry , manufacturing and aerospace capability . 
  so our spies were u2 aircraft , satellites , submarines and signals stations intercepting radio . 
  vmro - dpmne is the governing party , and sdsm is the opposition , right ? 
  sorry - - got a real beginner level knowledge of the modern politics of macedonia here . 
   birthrate is what it is , there is no normal birth rate to compare it to . 
  replacement rate tends to be what people anchor their ideas about the ` norm ' around because it 's growth neutral . 
  you 're correct on both counts , i believe . 
   to integrate them into german society to do this , you must impart german values , german civic virtue . 
  you must also necessarily * remove * syrian , or rather , levantine arab values , and virtues , which are in conflict . 
  there is only too much evidence that they are in conflict , and that they can not be reconciled - - the football video game playing , pot smoking isis recruits who have come from the west in droves after not assimilating as * natives * in the western european milieu is only too much proof of this . 
  military service will not do it , nor is this the object of military service . 
  military service and training is so that people who have embraced german civic values , can , by being a part of the bundeswehr instead of choosing national service , fulfill their civic duty of martial service to the german state - with the mission of defense . 
  to introduce such creep in functionality , where the military is made to take on such a role as playing cultural ambassador ( to people who have come * into * the country !, 
  ) , would be to weaken it , or at least mis-allocate it 's already minimal resources and capability . 
  * education * and furthermore * screening immigrants and refugees for those most likely to benefit from it * in german history , language , and civics , with the object of value for all of these things ** replacing ** that of the refugees ' current value structure , is the only thing you can do . 
  this . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pns_mehran_attack it 's only logistically possible for islamist groups to do this in places they can easily travel to and transport weapons to , for now . 
  but the foiled ak-on-a-train attack would 've been even worse than charlie hebdo . 
  i shudder to think what would happen in nyc if our metros saw a coordinated attack like mumbai 's . 
  it would be a slaughter . 
   when the fuck will the world realize that intelligence agencies are doing abysmally at protecting us from terrorism ? |  proceeds to list a huge number of terrorists known to intelligence services _________ so , they should be able to by force , apprehend and detain these people in custody before they 've committed any crime , maybe even holding them without a trial in a blacksite somewhere that is kept secret from civil authority and the media ? 
  * maybe even they could used enhanced levels of coercion in interrogating them to learn more about their plots ? 
  * i mean , what the fuck ? 
  ** should western government 's intelligence services be able to black bag someone , take them to a prison somewhere in the third world , and torture them , or else even interdict and kill them on that country 's own soil , when they are highly suspected of terrorism or being caught in the act ? 
  ** because if you answer `` no '' to that question , then you 're where most politicians overseeing the cia , mi6 , gign , et al. 
  are today , which is `` cover our asses '' and do n't do anything too risky . 
  if you answer `` yes '' to that question , then you 're asking for a law enforcement approach to a terrorist problem , and that approach does n't allow dramatic extrajudicial action . 
  ^ yep . 
  it 's from the kadi patta plant : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kadhi ka * dhi * ( it 's a velar sound , so that 's why british people sometimes said `` cu * rr * y ) . 
  anyways , this is basically used in indian food as ` sauce ' for rice and vegetables , or when it 's watered down as sort of a gruel . 
  it 's basically indian gravy . 
  ________________ okay , so then british people straight up used it as gravy , and the portuguese discovered s. american chili got added , and it 's turned into this new food `` curry '' which even has premade powders . 
   [ terrorists are criminals , not soldiers . 
  ] ( http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/54ad23536da811f019c7df73/photos-and-videos-show-2-gunmen-escaping-after-opening-fire-at-a-magazine-office-in-paris.jpg ) what happens the next time ? 
  when there are more , like in mumbai , and there are n't two shooters ? 
  what if there are 10 , or 20 ? 
  and you 're right , they 're not soldiers . 
  soldiers do n't try to shoot up passenger trains , either . 
  soldiers do n't try blowing up cars in the street . 
  this is n't just a law enforcement matter or a military matter - - it 's both . 
   i do n't understand why the abortion debate is so polarised , it 's not like gay marriage , because there 's literally one way by which evolution has determined humans get made , and we 're all pretty much on board with killing babies to be bad - - so the intervening period between baby-making and ` new born baby ' where we have the technology to turn off the baby-making process ... is that killing the baby ? 
  ^ this is the basic issue , and it 's not a non-issue for younger people in the same way `` hey should gay people be treated like equals ? '', 
  not too surprising ; even when the country is becoming way less religious/open to things like abortions to save a woman 's life . 
  the same is much how it goes in the us - plenty of people are totally irreligious , but do think of a pregnancy as a child to be/grew up with * some * sort of notion it was wrong in their surroundings , and so that 's where they 're psychologically anchored in the debate . 
  they 'll drink , have premarital sex , be totally fine with gay marriage , etc. 
  ... but on abortion , they 're just not down , even if otherwise they 're outwardly very much not christian . 
   availability of guns , maybe ? 
  why is n't the czech republic having bloodbaths like this ? 
  why is prague so peaceful ? 
  and germany/france have citizens who can buy semi-automatic weapons as well . 
  it 's mostly english now , right ? 
   i just ca n't get over the audacity these people have . 
  it 's like the opposite of the self-hatred and weakness of the people in the countries they 're going to ; but we talk about it as ` entitlement ' and ` audacity ' because we want them to be meek and grateful . 
  theirs is a hardened culture of survival and grit , and they are frankly possessed with a clearly greater drive for self determination and ownership of a situation than the empty suits ruling over europeans now . 
  they 're not going to be stopped , because the softness of the west does n't know how to stop them . 
  we 've no backbone , and they 've all the incentive in the world to push on . 
  it does n't quite work out like that - nyc requires them to interact with other minority groups , and thus the lingua franca of english is perpetuated . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_states_cities_by_spanish-speaking_population#metropolitan_areas sort the last column by percent of spanish-dominant speakers in the population . 
  decades of illegal amnesty has started the balkanization of the us on linguistic grounds ; we 're going to have an anglo-america and a latino-america , with different political objectives , different attitudes to the founding history and civic virtues of the us , and fundamentally different cultural norms and social arrangements . 
  i 'm not a white person , and i 'm not a monolingual english speaker . 
  mientras mi espanol es muy sencillo y necessito hablar solamente en tiempos sin complicaccion para tener un poco de fluencia - considero yo mismo un hispanohablante extranjero - - - - but i can tell you right now , that after america is no longer a white majority nation nationally , and a latino/hispano majority nation on the west coast/southwest , with the * huge * and * persistent * spanish speaker majorities in cities , and the continuing political party affiliation difference between white people ( particularly older and rural white people ) and latinos ( particularly younger and urban dwelling latinos ) , there are going to be a lot of ugly , ugly schisms in the us on domestic policy , particularly regarding economic redistribution . 
  already , much of california , texas , arizona , nevada , etc - - are basically just mexico , in terms of language , security realities , predominant culture and economic modes , etc.
