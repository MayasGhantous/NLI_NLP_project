  our entire system is built on the assumption that though this is useful , it is inherently and irreparably * dangerous * and capable of creating despotism if not checked . 
  ** put another way ** * we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . 
  -- that to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , -- that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness . 
  the centralization of power is always attractive to people who want to `` shape the future '' of people other than themselves . 
  i mean , i own guns , and i own them for hobby shooting and because i believe americans must have the tools of warfare owned by the citizenry so that our government may never become tyrannical without inviting mass armed rebellion , and i give money to appleseed primarily so younger kids will learn how to shoot . 
  i just think it 's an issue that should be approached with open eyes as to what killing another person really is . 
  it should n't ever be glamorized . 
  i mean , it 's very natural for young people ( especially young men and boys ) to be excited about war , and all the cool equipment and the smart martial dress , etc. 
  but i mean , come on : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzbckhxnxvc#t=1m36s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vjpl6pydtm#t=6m19s those girls do n't belong there . 
  it 's very endearing ( though i obviously disagree with the political alignment of the dpr , i can respect passion for one 's nation ) , but : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzbckhxnxvc#t=9m23s even then ; they 're so * young * . 
  they 're so goddamn young . 
  i 'm not saying people should n't serve ( nor am i so boorish to think poland has much of a choice but to have strong conventional forces ) , and i 'm aware that people in their 30s simply can not perform the same tasks asked of infantry that late teenaged up to mid 20s physically conditioned kids can , but still it bothers me that they seem so optimistic and cheery . 
  they 're all just young , nice kids , and if they do ever get sent somewhere , they 're going to see and be asked to do and have happen to them all the most horrible things in the world . 
  it 's just fucked up is all i 'm saying . 
  it 's not disenfranchising public opinion ; it 's the truest representation of national power - - the interplay of private economic interest and public administration of it in order to provide stable markets and monetary security . 
  the federal reserve is n't entirely private , and it is n't entirely public , and it is * the * institution of american economic power . 
  the girls they interviewed remind me so much of the ones in another vice report about eastern ukraine 's military school/patriot groups . 
  wonderfully sweet and very sentimental about their nation , but naive . 
  i hope there 's no more war over there at all . 
  these children do n't need that . 
  just heartbreaking to see how callous ( certain moscow based ) politicians can be when youths are like this . 
   russia would still do the same at the very beginning , then let ukraine make first nuclear strike yeah , no . 
  no one is saying `` we just need to have * one * of our population centers get literally nuked !, 
  that 'll open up a whole new world of strategy for us ! '' ), 
  except for you . 
   does america 's policy on nukes mirror it 's policy on domestic guns ? 
  not entirely ; our domestic policy on guns is a tension between traditionalists/conservatives/libertarians on one side who view firearms as both a heritage based hobby , and securing the material right of the people to overthrow their government or else make tyranny untenable , and progressives/liberals/collectivists who view civil ownership of firearms as an unacceptable risk , much more likely to enable criminal action than anything else , and the notion of civil dissent backed by force against government to be contrary to their own goals . 
  insofar as the similarities : i 'll be happy to accept * any * gun control regime in the united states that applies equally and retroactively to the police , private security , military and any federal law enforcement or contractors . 
  if other nations really committed to non-proliferation , the us would too . 
  until then , though ... 
  thank the dod !, 
  http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2014/0514_atlanticresolve/ actually , though , you can straight up tweet at the european command . 
  i mean , neither ukraine or georgia are nato nations . 
  it would require the us to aggress on russia to take action - - it would n't be entirely `` defending '' them , because we 're not in any stated defensive pact . 
  that would be insane , and if you do n't get why , i mean , okay . 
  neither you nor myself are us policy makers . 
  i 'm just telling you , this is how the law and policy is , for reasons that should be totally clear to you . 
  poland is nato . 
  polish troops fought and died for us interests in wartime , and poland 's intelligence apparatus aided ours in extrajudicial actions . 
  poland is on track to meet a 2 % of gdp funding obligation , largely spent on modern hardware . 
  we tight , fam the * balls * it would take for us policy makers to make some case for abandoning poland are far larger than it would take to stand by poland 's side . 
   ( barring a change in russian society the same way german society changed in the 60s ) german society did n't so much undergo a change in the * 60s * as it did some pretty severe changes some twenty years prior . 
  if your nation 's belligerence is met with your political class being permanently imprisoned and hanged , and 50 % casualties of death or severe injury to the male cohort , there 's just not gon na be a lot of steam left for belligerence . 
  same deal with japan . 
  a lot of their leadership was pretty feisty right up until the end . 
  then they got nuked , twice . 
  it 's hard to be feisty after you 've been nuked , twice . 
  frankly , this is why we ** desperately ** need a political solution . 
  the other solution is literally killing lots and lots of russian federation troops while making nuclear movement too costly for their leadership to consider , and somehow destroying their government . 
  it would be unbelievably bloody and the closest to global destruction we 've ever been . 
   americans believe everything their msm tells them . 
  except for when we 're routinely vilifying it , i guess . 
   how about posting some hard facts instead of speculations ? 
  ^ this is the same thing people who deny evolution will do . 
  because there is n't a strict proof , but only likelihoods on the balance of evidence for a certain explanation , they 'll say that there 's no way to draw a conclusion . 
   `` it 's too early to say if the buk was a russian or an ukrianian one ''  so , case closed . 
  i get that english is n't your first language , but ` case closed ' is hardly the conclusion to draw from `` it 's too early to say ... '', 
   there is no concrete evidence that it was a russian buk true ; but it strikes me as highly unlikely that any scenario other than russian backed separatists shooting down a passenger plane on accident with the arms and equipment and training coming from moscow could be possible .

  sanders does n't have a chance . 
  a non-religious jewish heritage socialist from brooklyn who 's been on the left and stridently so since the 60 's is not becoming the president , regardless of his actual policy positions . 
  he 's just too culturally alien for most of the country . 
  1 ) saosin , really ? 
  that 's not the western culture you were supposed to fall in love with . 
  2 ) about an hour ago mh17 prosecutor fred westerbeke : `` it 's too early to say if the buk was a russian or an ukrianian one '' * too early to say definitively * it was n't ukrainians celebrating about downing a large plane right before news broke a civilian passenger plane was shot down * it was n't ukraine preventing everyone from having inspector access to the site * it was n't them looting the corpses for clothing and personal items ( or evidence ) , either . 
  * ukraine has access to this missile platform as a former member of the soviet union * the separatists have access to it because * some other * member of the former soviet union is providing it to them - - i wonder who that could be . 
  europe has already made its decision , informally as decided by the ez 's big economic powers , and via the eu as a whole - - - outright warfare ( crimea ) and proxy-war ( donbass ) against a geographically , culturally , and historically ` european ' sovereign nation by a foreign power and non-eu/ez nation state like russia is nearly entirely meaningless in terms of disrupting economic and military relations unless prodded by nato/us to engage in strict sanctions and material deprivation of the hostile actor 's economy and military . 
  it does n't even matter if you murder hundreds of the eu 's citizens ( even as a nato nation ! ), 
  when you engage in those hostilities . 
  they 'll very quietly protest and nothing will come of it . 
  unless the economy of russia goes into complete collapse , and putin is overthrown , they will recover - - they 'll stabilize at a lower quality of life with less imported goods and even more of their economy dependent on petroleum with even worse conditions for the average russian . 
  but unless there is collapse , they 'll simply stabilize and be as stubborn as they 've always been , and begin the slow process of growth again . 
  this news changes nothing because it does n't change the foreign policy calculus of any leadership in europe . 
   is there a ultra-secret ? 
  security clearances in the us kind of work like this , in addition to a ` controlled ' , ` secret ' , ` top-secret ' and us nationals only system : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sensitive_compartmented_information#access, 
  i blame being born speaking the lingua franca for my poor second language acquisition . 
   i happen to be john c. mcginley 's fan and specifically his role as dr. cox from the sitcom scrubs . 
  yeah , he does it all the time with `` reeehheheaaaally '' and the like . 
  russian 's pretty tough ; spanish was bad enough for me . 
  i 'm still relatively young though ( 24 ) , i think i can get at least as functional as i am in spanish in two or three years . 
  did n't know that !, 
  i have some more reading to do !, 
  sounds a lot like the hassles the caucasus have with land ownership and native vs indigeneous vs autochthonous people quarreling over whose fields belong to whom . 
  america lucked out hardcore - we just genocided the native peoples and the most you can say is that some mexicans via the notion of * la raza * believe that the southwest is still ` theirs ' on ethnolinguistic grounds . 
  other than that we never have to worry about territorial integrity . 
   vehhhherrrryy soon , i guess ? 
  ^ that 's quite impressive for someone who speaks english as a learned foreign language , picking up on the insertion of strained laughter in a superlative like that . 
  here i am fumbling over tbl and vy conjugations . 
   any such system is open to abuse . 
  all lawmaking is open to abuse . 
  any system of enforced norms that deigns to propose a methodology beyond individuals vying against one another in complete non-control has to have group coercion as an enforcement mechanism and is open to abuse . 
  that fire can burn down my home is not the only thing i take into account when deciding whether or not to cook . 
  what a zeroth order criticism . 
  there probably will be some people who are a little more discriminating with their sexual behavior of they ca n't reliably obtain pregnancy/sti preventing prophylactics , but that 's not really the reason russia is doing this . 
  condoms are a low dollar ( well ... ruble ) high volume consumer good purchase , are n't incredibly hard to make , but they 're imported into russia and russians opt for foreign brands . 
  testing the waters with an import ban , seeing how their own industries adapt to something that will continue to have significant demand for substitute goods , and seeing how the russian public takes it is all of great interest to the regime . 
  it 's creature comfort consumer goods : condoms , diapers , cell phone chargers , pens , imported snack foods , etc. 
  stuff that is n't vital like medicine , luxury like high fashion , or utility like vehicles - - - that 's the stuff whose absence on shelves * really * makes things look bad to average consumers , in addition to food shortages . 
  russia is just exploring what future economic isolation might look like , with a test case/pandering to the orthodox church . 
  no , the solution is to change the economic conditions and sentencing laws that lead to mass imprisonment .
