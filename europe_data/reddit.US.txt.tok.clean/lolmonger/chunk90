  and ** yet ** we manage , and will somewhat manage in the future with such a run-up of difference . 
  the long term future of the eu is * not * one i am optimistic about , because cultural blending and the prioritization of one group 's interests over the other is n't just a bifurcated system there , it 's dozens of national and linguistic identities with different cultural and economic priorities and lots of violent and resented history . 
  shit 's gon na be crazy . 
  in our own city , there are entire economies and polities which exist on the basis of language barrier . 
  there are people who vote in mandarin , russian , and spanish , because they only consume news and conversation in mandarin , russian , and spanish in nyc - - they do n't even buy their metro tickets without using those languages . 
  [ one does not inhabit a country ; one inhabits a language . 
  that is our country , our fatherland - and no other .

  there 's no point in getting angry . 
  i 'd sooner see us troops fighting and dying for swedish territorial integrity and political sovereignty than i would them attempting to police some hellhole in south asia or the middle east . 
  it 's time we cut our losses on defense and installation , and protecting and doing trade with the pacific nations and extra-ez/eu european nations is where we are best poised to counteract chinese and russian intentions which are contrary to our own . 
   basic income will become necessary once robots are able to replace most manual labor . 
  what manual labor jobs 100 years ago have n't been almost entirely replaced by robots or factory workers who do n't even live in the countries their product is sold ? 
  i think the case for complete labor oversupply is overstated . 
  particularly in the field of elder-care , robots have been ( with japan leading the charge for a long time , as they do not want to import immigrants to change their population dynamic ) astoundingly subpar at such a task , while the aging/aged populations of developed nations only come to represent more and more of the people . 
  https://gbr.pepperdine.edu/2010/08/preparing-for-a-future-labor-shortage/ in fact , i believe that the trend of baby boomers * not * retiring is going to massively and quickly reverse itself as aging and death inevitably remove huge numbers of them from the workforce in the next decade , leaving many firms without upper management and skilled workers - - - as the millenials have n't been having kids and having been getting married .

   it 's funny that a country that did n't exist until 250 years ago , from a continent that was unknown to civilization at the time china had control over these islands can have any claims in the area boy , does that make other countries sound pretty lazy . 
  yeah , but you can see how they 're etymologically related and it 's still a '' `` ha ha !, 
  black people ! '', 
  joke ultimately . 
   the chinese are n't creating any islands , they are expanding the natural ones do you get paid in dollars or euro or what ? 
  the creditor might be more interested in establishing a line of credit that gives them political sway the internal affairs of russia . 
  i can see the standing committee of the politburo of the prc being pretty pleased with a loan that turns into a de facto part by part purchase of say within the russian government . 
   i 'm sure if more westerners knew who hoxha and ceausescu were there would be people drooling over them as well . 
  not ceausescu , because that run up against the progressive narrative of never taking a position which is counter to ~ ~ abortion ~ ~ reproductive rights . 
  i can disagree with the political dictums of the russian state , and feel a level of contempt for those russian troops only too willing to carry out the annexation by force of the crimean peninsula , and act as support and command/control for separatists they armed and backed up in annexing eastern ukraine , but the deaths of people is always something to care about . 
  * who the fuck is buying our printers ? 
  * bahahahahaha, 
  forgive him , we have trained him incorrectly , as a joke . 
  do n't you just love it when foreign people try educating you about your own country 's political realities ? 
  ^ the people who get the angriest in the u.s. over illegal immigration and the non-response/benefits they get are generally legal immigrants who proved their economic and civic worth would be additions and never burdens . 
  ... i mean , was n't really suggesting * that * , either . 
  but poland is pretty well regarded in terms of future economic heft . 
  that 's not really what i was suggesting , either . 
  more like benelux, 
  ** or ** , * or * the v4 nations could carve out a political identity for eastern nations that is n't russia 's `` slavic brotherhood '' abusiveness or the exploitation of the west 's economic/political dictums . 
  just sayin ', 
  it 's actually pretty high ; majorities in a couple states . 
  we 'll actually cease being a white country ( in terms of majority ; still a plurality ) in 2040 abouts . 
  still , yeah , that guy is a fucknut . 
  the foremost consideration being their tiny population , the second being its near complete homogeneity of lifestyle , values and culture . 
  the far third place being skyr . 
  you can not quarrel with people if you 've eaten skyr . 
  you 're either satisfied , or slightly queasy . 
   why , for the love of god why , do people care so much about what their neighbors do or what their history is . 
  i 'm not condoning bigotry , but if people have fundamental values and preferences that they think are correct , this will be a result . 
  there are pleeeeeeeenty of people in manhattan who simply can not accept the idea of firearms ownership , and would n't want someone who owns a gun living next to them - - or someone who is a devout baptist or whatnot . 
  when someone cares about something relevant to their identity , there 's tribe and ` other ' constructed in their head , and they want to be around people who are like them , not unlike them . 
   line up perfectly with a slavoj zizek slavoj zizek has gotten * exactly * the same treatment for saying european 's left elements are missing the mark on immigration/refugees/all cultures being equal that susan sontag did in the 80s when she pointed out how often the left had apologized for the atrocities of communism because they did n't want to feel like they were aligned in any way with right wing critics of the soviet union in the us . 
  ideological nuance is just not an option for many on the left , then or now . 
   weird part is that rammstein band is far left . 
   e : sorry i mean `` kinda '' left . 
  no , they 're pretty far left : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph-ca_tu5ka in addition to flake and til lindemann 's consistent ostalgia , they literally wrote a song declaring themselves unabashed leftists , with the collectivist imagery of worker ants killing oppressors as they pantomimed soviet era communist films . 
  they 're leftists and it 's a shame they get so easily associated with the * wrong * sort of national socialist german workers ... 
  the other two are either willing to silence them in academia or social circles with the bludgeon of racism accusation , or willing to watch and let it happen . 
  rearranging deck chairs on the titanic . 
  there is no more europe ; whatever paperworks of polity remain are the involuntary muscle contractions of a skewered animal , writhing without sense or objective , impaled by sharp circumstances it has run into headfirst for want of observing the path before it . 
   that 's an oxymoron . 
   if we ( still ) had the superior culture , we would n't see it destroyed before our eyes . 
  oh yes . 
  this is where i 've come to , though it is a bitter pill to swallow . 
  the mark of a society is how much of their policy and wealth goes towards the world the future will inherit , not the past to sustain . 
  whether they are pumping medicine into a corpse , or planting seeds . 
  as a hindu myself , my response would be : `` because this school is a catholic one , and they wanted to have catholic students before hindu ones . 
  they can still be your friends , but welcome to the real world and how there is nothing like justice , only power , and institutions have power individuals ca n't . '', 
  there should always be public , secular , free schools for children of a nation to go to . 
  full stop . 
  but i do n't think this principle was violated in this case , wherein this girl is now still going to school , and the parochial interest in prioritizing students of the religion the institution exists to serve was also met . 
  not every ` good ' policy solution has to be the most heartwarming , social justice and wrong-righting one . 
  ** czech republic ** in addition , best for beer and women . 
   i 've already met americans , seen and touched their ... tanks . 
  't was nice . 
  anytime anyone calls me a gun fetishist , i 'm reminded not everyone has fired heavy ordnance at a thing , and seen that thing cease to be after a terrific explosion . 
  the first time i used a grenade launcher , i discovered a new experience . 
  the second time , i just did it to feel like myself . 
   the vast majority of illegal labor is in parts of the economy in which americans refuse to work ( farm labor ) . 
  ** , at garbage wages ** do n't leave that part out . 
  mass importation of people to work the same job drops the wage norms . 
  and of lots of them * still * come out ahead making less than legal minimum wages in us dollars in relative safety in the us as opposed to pesos in a place like mexico and can make their kids us citizens ? 
  what do you think happens to the wage norms then ? 
  illegal immigration sidesteps minimum wage laws , and mass immigration drives down wage norms itself , and heightens competition for a near static pool of jobs . 
    do you really think americans would be willing to work at a cheap enough wage to compete with illegal labor ? 
  1 ) so when the illegals magically assimilate , they 'll keep working cheap , right ? 
  2 ) if liberals never advocated for minimum wages ever again and we had a federal moratorium on unions , i might accept this argument as an apologia for illegals . 
   i do n't know what kind of history you 've studied , but large proportions of first-generation immigrants do not learn the language . 
  they rely on their children for translation and can only engage in very basic english . 
  meanwhile , their children go to american schools , grow up as american children , and probably speak better english than their parents ' language . 
  never before in us history has this percentage of our population been foreign born . 
  the literal racial balance of the us will change and three generations on , spanish speakers have n't assimilated . 
  this is fundamentally different from the european ** and ** chinese immigration to the us wherein those populations assimilated . 
   the unique problem of mexican immigration is how we have criminalized their lives and made them afraid to connect with locals . 
  t no it 's that they came by the millions and established entirely insular communities . 
  there are no fewer than ten metropolitan areas in the us , mostly in california , where spanish is the primary language and foreign origin is the norm . 
  entire cities and suburbs of the us are effectively mexico in language , culture , and political expectations . 
  the thing about culture and language is that it generally goes parent to child , unless the surrounding community the child grows up in overwhelms the home culture so that their public life is lived as the rest of the community . 
  this is why historically separated racial groups have different cultural patterns and linguistic patterns - the genetic pattern propagation was sequestered . 
  this is also why ` ethnicity ' is so often a linkage of language and culture , wherein a russian who speaks russian and has a russian nationality is also someone with russian/slavic blood , etc. 
  really the only large and powerful nation that does n't have this going on is the us and we 're the bizarre exception to the rule .
