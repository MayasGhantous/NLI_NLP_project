   in indiana , we dont even care if your illegal or not . 
  speak for yourself . 
   first , you do n't need to speak english to be american . 
  throughout our history , we 've had large populations of exclusively german - , norwegian - , and swedish-speaking peoples , as well as french/creole people along the mississippi and in louisiana they all vastly assimilated within one to two generations . 
  dual language persistence of all non-spanish languages does n't come close to what 's happened with latin american immigration . 
    second , this is the free market working as intended . 
  cheaper products ( even when of less quality ) so long as they are accepted by the customer , will win out if the american left were willing to accept the repeal of minimum wage laws and a permanent moratorium on unions , i would accept the line of `` well the mexicans work more for less , so obviously it 's a good thing they 're here and employed instead of paying americans more '', 
   , i took a year before leaving to norway to study the language ( could only find swedish courses so i took those , then self studied norwegian at night ) and tried to find cultural events ( sons of norway ) here to get to know more about norwegian culture , this is much like what my indian parents did before they came to the us long ago . 
  you rock * american * flair and so do i. 
  that 's the consequence of a reasonably hard immigration processes of determining immigrant cultural fit and economic self provision . 
  it 's a selection criterion on how similar or how able to become similar to the norm a foreign entrant is . 
  i do n't see any reason that should n't be the immigration law in every country . 
  i mean look at the polish approach to the eurozone . 
  they 're basically in the situation of telling the girl you 're fucking `` yeah , sure baby , we 'll get married . '', 
  like ... so long as she thinks so ... why actually go through with it , you know ? 
  what 's there to win ? 
   so that was america a 100 years ago . 
  today the assimilationist approach is dead . 
  50 % of all california schoolchildren speak another language than english at home . 
  that 's because of changes to immigration law in 1965 and then mass immigration from latin america ( particularly mexico ) in the 80s . 
  you can look up the foreign born population/percentage of americans who speak a language other than english in the home to verify this . 
  the multiculturalism ( rather , the anglo | hispano divide ) of california even is recent , there just happen to be a lot of californians . 
  those are just that : little sections of insular immigrant communities . 
  furthermore , most of the european immigrants totally assimilated . 
  no one is really `` irish '' or `` italian '' in the us anymore . 
  you 'll see walsh 's with shocks of bright right hair and deep catholic guilt and palladinos whose grandmother has an accent and the family still makes mostly italian food ... 
  ... but they 're otherwise entirely americanized and more often than not , mixed in with the rest of the anglo population . 
  massive immigration from latin america that 's broken so many records has also defied our immigration past as spanish speaking communities grow on size with spanish as the primary language and their civic values reflect latino notions of state and polity more than individualist american ones . 
  you can mix in small amounts of other stuff for texture and consistency and still have a banana milkshake , but if you put in 1/3 to 1/2 the same amount of strawberries in ... it 's a straw berry banana milkshake . 
  no amount of blending will change the fact you 've overpowered the normal flavor . 
   if you have n't done something relevant educationally , like engineering or geology or chemistry , you 're probably looking at being a roustabout or service staff ( cleaning , cooking , etc ) - effectively the choice is between outside or inside crew . 
  just wan na throw this out there , but none of the post-docs or grad students so work with make nearly as much money or have made as much money in their careers as the average oil rig worker out in nebraska . 
  academic science is an unbelievably shitty return on investment , and you have to get into the higher echelons of research and development ( often * for * the petroleum industry ) to make the big bucks . 
  no , i know that . 
  i 've studied a decent amount of chemistry and physics . 
  i 'm curious as to what he means by contesting : `` 60 percent of austria 's electricity '' produced by wind and water by clarifying it 's energy and not electricity . 
  what is the mode of actual consumer pull on energy production in austria that he draws this distinction , in terms of production , storage and delivery that he says this ? 
  is there such differentiation in things like residential heating and industrial use ? 
  that is what i want to know , and was sincerely asking about . 
   electricity , not energy . 
  could you expand on that distinction ? 
   i have an eu flag because i do n't like to consider myself as any one nation , having lived in more than one nation , and consider myself a blend of more than one european country 's culture . 
  are ukrainians africans ? 
  are they americans ? 
  are they asians ? 
  or does being ` european ' - - if they are - - count for nothing when it comes to being murdered unless they 've got the right piece of paper . 
  how about polish concerns over nordstream 2 or hungarian concerns over mass immigration ? 
  how much do those matter ? 
   i guess my severe lack of patriotism * that 's exactly what i 'm talking about * you can say there 's a europe and ` european ' identity all you want , but unless it means there are things people are willing to sacrifice for ; in policy , financially , and martially , then there frankly is n't . 
  you think most americans who signed up to fight tojo and hitler knew people from hawaii before pearl harbor ? 
  * heard * of ` pearl harbor ' ? 
  hawaii was n't even a state until 1959 . 
  you think that made a lick of difference to them ? 
   it 's not the diversity that causes war , it 's the attempts to purge diversity . 
  then again ; how different can peoples really be before they stop getting along , and how poorly can people get along before there is violence ? 
   same reason an american might have used a us flag before the civil war ? 
  we had a cohesive nation before 1863 , too . 
  when we fought the british in 1812 , in washington , and in new orleans , we did so as americans . 
  but sure - - the complete failures of the eu in 2015 can be ignored because the united states had themselves a civil war over a century ago . 
  ** none of this matters ** because the eu is totally dysfunctional . 
  nations exist because of three pillars : polity , economy , and military . 
  the procedures by which you do things , the way you produce and finance things , and who and for why you together as a people will kill things . 
  that 's pretty much what defines nation-hood . 
  on the refugee and ez crisis , the eu has proved its complete dysfunction as the mismatch between euro * zone * and euro * union * politics , national interest politics , and the relationship between private capitalization and public spending was shown to be not a unified front , but a panoply of competing , adversely so , interests without democratic governance . 
  there clearly is n't a eurozone ; there are creditor and debtor nations , there are returns seekers and budget seekers . 
  there clearly is n't an eu ; there are labor seekers and welfare seekers , there are monetary assistance seekers and sovereignty seekers . 
  but the most shameful , absolutely the most shameful failure of europe is on the pillar of nationhood that is military . 
  it 's not just economic futures and political fighting over who owes what and who has to take in what refugees . 
  it 's actual life and death . 
  [ ** what commando units were these two part of ? 
  ** ] ( http://iw69.blog.bg/photos/35897/original/2.jpg ) - nsfw were they brave soldiers , trained to fight , ready to die ? 
  were they kremlin backed paramilitaries ? 
  frontline ukrainian defense forces ? 
  if you support putin 's claims about the reality of the conflict , if you support poroshenko 's , if you support merkel 's or hollande 's or obama 's , can you say this is acceptable in europe ? 
  the french and german governments do n't really care that much , because they have energy concerns , as do other western european nations . 
  spain has energy agreements , too . 
  and they are very far from what the russian federation seeks to assimilate . 
  the netherlands , who lost so many of their people ? 
  what sanctions can they enforce ? 
  what military strength do they have on their own ? 
  how european does one need to be before membership in the eu is n't a pre-condition of aid against barefaced , unbridled aggression ? 
  and if the ukrainians ** were ** eu members , would it have even made a difference ? 
  or would their lack of being a nato nation resulted in them being abandoned anyway ? 
  are n't they european ? 
  or are they distant enough that it does n't matter . 
  un fucking believable , that there can be this level of inaction and non-retaliation and non-solidarity . 
  ** the fuck do you people even have an eu flag for ? 
  ** it 's not a nation , and it never will be , until the economic futures of greeks are just as important as germans , until the concerns about cultural identity of hungarians are just as important as the social justice one upmanship of swedes , until the security of people linked by history , culture , and society as europeans are just as important as the political and energy concerns of people whose governments have the right pieces of paper on file in brussels . 
  railroading policy over national objections when it serves the eu , and totally abandoning solidarity as nations when it does n't serve parochial interests . 
  fucking low . 
   the only way to stop this is to have a clear separation of powers between what the eu is allowed to do versus what nations are allowed to do . 
  you ca n't just have checks and balances - the people have to be willing and able to enforce them at the soap box , ballot box , and jury box . 
   interestingly here in germany elementary school teachers are paid fairly well and there 's still not much interest from men . 
  just to give you an idea : here in berlin a primary school teacher makes about 55000 $ a year before taxes , which puts them fairly high up in the food chain . 
  sounds like they should up the salary for male teachers even more . 
  part of it is that dictators and leaders not constrained by term limits do n't really act in the best interests of their people . 
  they act in a way to perpetuate their reign . 
  anything that means more power for them , and longer reigns , gets done . 
  nothing else matters . 
  in a small group , wherein the linkage of one family 's economic faith or inbred duty to polity to a national fate is real ( small kingdoms , charismatic community leaders , heads of household ) it works .
