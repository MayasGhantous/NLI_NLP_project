  in large one 's it 's pretty much always abusive and awful . 
  i 'm not even sure it 's an arrangement ( individual/s power over groups ) that can persist without abusive coercion . 
   edit : i dream of making a `` 2 $ berlin '' app . 
  a map for good food for under 2 $ and less let 's do it . 
  if i had lots of money , i would * invest in eastern poland * , not kidding . 
  i was going back and forth between the hk 416 and fn scar because both are currently in service ( albeit in specialized roles ) are are truly changed rifles ( the m4s variations at their core could have - and essentially did via the car series , existed immediately after the m16s adoption ) ... 
  yet both fundamentally could not have been built without stoner totally changing the design paradigms of the day , from chosen caliber to ideas about battlefield ergonomics . 
  the stgw . 
  57 or fn-49 are where most people 's heads were at . 
  the ar-10 was as big of a design shift as john browning 's pistol designs compared to the bergmann and roth-steyer and schwarlose era pistols . 
  te colt 1903 compared to pistols of its era just looks sexy . 
  but it also has far better controls and grip angle , etc. 
  a similar departure would be kalashnikov . 
  simonov 's sks was much like the m14 ( in design inertia ) . 
  a tilting bolt ( like the fal ) semi auto ... but designed around stripper clips and a fixed magazine . 
  the ak-47 was just so wonderfully and radically innovative . 
  so , that 's why i picked that one . 
  there 's actually quite a difference between traditional stocks and pistol grips - - and furniture being wooden or polymer makes a difference , too !, 
  the posture you assume , foot placement , how much you pull or push with your hands ( and where on the rifle ) etc. 
  is totally different in supported and unsupported shooting because of the pistol grip , and wood vs polymer is ( though much less so now ) mostly a grip/weight trade off . 
  [ this rifle ] ( http://www.silverlakecorp.com/images/fs2000fb.jpg ) and [ this rifle ] ( http://www.lacitroenbx19gt.com/photos/k31/presentation/_dsc0465.jpg ) are the two most comfortable rifles to shoot in my opinion , but they have radically different ergonomic philosophies . 
  ** deja vu ** http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/08/us-bulgaria-russia-defence-iduskcn0hx1t020141008  bulgarian foreign minister danail mitov issued a statement ... `` as for the implicit accusations of disloyalty , i would like to remind ( the comments ' ) authors that the republic of bulgaria is a member of the eu and nato and it does not owe explanations about its sovereign decisions to third parties . '', 
  both . 
  [ this is one of the very first ar-10 rifles built by eugene stoner ] ( http://www.forgottenweapons.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ar10early-1024x237.jpg ) at the armalite division of fairchild engine and airplane corp ( a spinoff of which would later build the a-10 aircraft incidentally ) , in 1955-6 , stoner devised this rifle in 7.62 nato . 
  fully automatic , just a hair over seven pounds , straight line recoil , modern wonder polymer furniture , aluminum and steel construction , etc. 
  the only thing it did n't have was a proper barrel - - the head of armalite went over stoner 's head and used a prototype barrel that failed in a stress test , so the us army went from [ this ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/roblox-apocalypse-rising/images/5/53/m1-garand-rifle.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141106215357 ) ... to [ this ] ( http://www.lrbarms.com/images/831_m14sa_22_cl_gi_walnut.jpg ) vietnam showed the us army that their stodgy brass were totally wrong about what kind of weapon was necessary ( we used to call it `` mout '' ) for the new kinds of conflicts and operating doctrine us troops would need , and stoner 's redesign was [ chosen ] ( http://www.gunsnet.net/photopost/data/500/medium/retro.jpg ) lots more refinement , and we get something like this : [ decades later ] ( http://www.fnherstal.com/uploads/pics/scar_h_cqc_d.jpg ) . 
  military weapons have to be innovative enough that they add value and allow greater capacity , yet relying on tried and proven approaches and techniques , integrate into standing doctrine and allow flexibility for newer conflicts , present low barriers to training and efficient use , and do all of this more cheaply than maintaining or re-ordering current inventory . 
  it 's a * tremendously * difficult thing to do right , and the consequences of doing it wrong are disastrous , so there 's a lot of institutional inertia . 
  and this is just small arms !, 
  now think about how complicated it can get with tanks , missile cruisers , aircraft carriers , and airframes . 
  the intersection of mass logistics , technical and engineering evaluation and testing , financial management , and war planning is obscenely knotted and complicated . 
  1 ) what 's your military background ? 
  2 ) what does justify an air strike ? 
   a relatively standard medical procedure . 
  why is it medical ? 
  is part of medicine ? 
  like , it 's a treatment for a pathology ? 
  and standard ? 
  standard for whom ? 
  way to go !, 
  you 're doing great !, 
  capitalism sure , but south korea 's development under park departed from american style polity in many significant ways . 
  because dialectical thinking destroys nuance . 
  it 's up and down , black and white , left and right , oppressor oppressed , majority minority , good bad , us them . 
  the mode of analysis that post-modernism and critical theory studiously employ has written into every leftist head the narrative of oppressive western white traditional conservative male judeochristian patriarchal colonist imperialist cis gendered on one side and radical alternative minority progressive liberal female queer muslim feminist populist on the other . 
  the lines have been so thoroughly drawn for most people 's thinking that it 's impossible for them to productively think otherwise : look at how hard it is for the left to simply condemn muslims acting in adherence with islamic doctrine in worse ways over the same issues they so gleefully criticize christians over . 
  https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/03/12/specials/sontag-communism.html  miss sontag , a leading figure among intellectuals here for the last 20 years , startled a gathering in town hall on feb. 6 with her remarks , which drew boos and shouts from the audience . 
   the thesis she presented to her colleagues was that they - she included herself in the phrase - had been misunderstanding the nature of communist countries at least since the 1950 's . 
  the motive , she said , appeared to be a desire by intellectuals to disassociate themselves from the virulent anti-communism of the mccarthy era . 
   '' i have the impression that much of what is said about politics by people on the so-called democratic left - which includes many people here tonight - has been governed by the wish not to give comfort to ` reactionary ' forces , '' miss sontag said . 
  said another way : `` we 've had our heads up our fucking asses , because we were afraid to say anything that might look like we agreed with the original people we got angry with '' the leftist westerner 's embrace of marxism and radical leftist ideology will millions died of famine and purges far away from their comfortable ivory tower is replaced by today 's western leftist 's desire to lecture everyone they should n't be too critical of muslims lopping off heads in 2015 , [ lest americans forget that christians in europe centuries ago perpetrated the crusades ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/us/politics/obama-national-prayer-breakfast-terrorism-islam.html?_r=0 ) , so , you know - - - how much can we criticize isis , * really * ? 
  at some point , the `` anti-racist is code for anti-white '' copypasta people are going to sound more and more reasonable . 
  this is the ultimate tragedy of the left 's choices in the us and europe on mass immigration , multiculturalism , and diversity promotion - - they 've done it in a way that is scolding , unilateral , and dismissive of actual fears and insecurities about ` the other ' replacing ` the us ' , and the public simply wo n't react to that well . 
   nato 's expansive actions ** again ** lithuania or romania asking nato to join , as sovereign nations , is n't nato expanding . 
  it 's sovereign national governments choosing to join nato , asking to join nato . 
  it is nations which used to be in the sphere of influence via the warsaw pact or literally under the boot of the soviet union * making the choice themselves * to associate with the west and nato and not russia or non-alignment . 
   hostile and anti-russian oh , i 'll totally agree that nato is inherently a martial and russian directed alliance . 
  no question . 
   if the anti-russian alliance keeps expanding and initiating hostilities what 's an example of initiated hostilities from nato against russia ? 
   against russia 's allies ( ukraine the russian federation annexing crimea and supporting rebel seperatists in eastern ukraine ... is * nato aggression ? 
  *  and there are measures that can be taken in return . 
  straight up , short of launching nuclear missiles , there 's nothing russia can do with conventional military power or economic leverage to ever compete with the west or the united states . 
  literally nothing . 
  and , including nuclear missiles , the us still has a far more sophisticated and forward deployed nuclear capacity than russia , so , even if putin fucks up and lets birds fly , unless the world actually ends , america still wins . 
  in no situation is force ever a winning option for russia , but maybe it 'll take some increasing mortality and morbidity indices , some more crushed economic futures , some more abortions of necessity and expatriated millionaires and billionaires , some more breadlines and failed tech centers like skolkovo , etc. 
  for you people to start electing leaders who are n't cry-baby `` i ca n't believe we lost '' ex-kgb types from the failed soviet . 
   nation states are an artificial creation conceived by elites eager to enhance their influence that 's not quite true . 
  actually , you can even see it in flags - - have you ever wondered why so many nations have simple , bold colored tri-bi color flags that ascribe blue or white or red to tears or purity or the blood of patriots ? 
  it was actually a reaction of most modern nation states being formed in the rejection of the ornate , family crest centric banners of the nobility that * used * to rule over people . 
  nations are fundamentally a conception of equality by assoiation to a national identity - - an italian is a * italian * by birth and his genetic and ethnic identity as such . 
  whether he is a noble or pauper is irrelevant . 
  populist , demogaugery of the exalted common man was * all over * the rhetoric of nationalist movements in the 19th and 20th century . 
   most of the scientific , cultural , social movements have always been pan-european phenomena . 
  wut can you justify that ? 
   a lot has changed since 2013 . 
  organizations like nato , militaries , etc. 
  the tragedy is that they are most vital in awful situations . 
  it will be a lurid , nightmarish time for humanity if article 5 has to be invoked in the defense of poland against russian aggression . 
  it will mean a lot of young polish kids , a lot of young american kids , and a lot of young russian kids , are going to die in ugly , painful , tortuous ways that no human can really deserve , and which almost all of them certainly wo n't . 
  but nato has to be strong and decisvely capable of ending such a war so that not only are n't nato casualties very high , but russian ones are n't either . 
  it is a kindness to crush a nation quickly in war , so that peace can come sooner . 
   it contains an implicit assumption that russia is somehow entitled to a sphere of influence beyond its borders and it also undermines and is disrespectful of the sovereignty , self-determination and democracy of lithuania . 
  `` bro , you 're not allowed to date chrissy , she 's my girl - bro code man , bro code !!! '', 
  is fundamentally what the russian attitude toward 's nato expansion is . 
  it 's hidden behind the sophistry of international relations and pr speak , but at its core , it 's this petulant and entitled and dismissive of agency . 
  the us is just the guy going `` hey , christina is coming over to my place tonight , deal with it '' and ivan ca n't handle that or the fact that other nations actually have a choice . 
  it 's the same here ... except that kind of deterrent is * also * meant to be directed at our * own * government !, 
  the point is to make anyone 's broad aggression against the american people materially a very hard thing to do . 
  it comes down to how girls and women feel about having children and having the obligations of motherhood . 
  it * does * essentially mean an end to a lot of the features of youth that pretty much * all * advertising and culture exemplifies as good/fun/enjoyable . 
  this exists for guys too ; they 're not rushing to commit ( because let 's face it : the hookup standard is simply not the marriage standard if we even have the latter ) , but it 's especially acute for women . 
  until we stop demonizing motherhood/staying at home and caring for children/prioritizing * careeeeeeeeer * success as the mark of a successful human regardless of gender , and point out that , yes , men and women can have different roles because of their gender ... ... then men and women are each going to compete for the same things out of life , and that means much less time for motherhood . 
  no amount of subsidized daycare can really get around this basic problem . 
  no , but if he had a life and legitimate job and reason to plan for the future and could live in comfort without requiring to enforce his own brand of laws because his economic mode of self provision was outside the law , he 'd have basically no reason to throw that all away by dealing with people or being the sort of person , who commits firearms crime . 
   such weapons have the potential to kill dozens of people in the right hands , thus i never really understood why a normal citizen should even access to such heavy weaponry . 
  in the us , our firearms law has its motivation in the sensibility that caused the founders to write the 2a back when citizens could ( and did ) own the same muskets and cannons of professional armies ( privately owned warships and cannons were actually the basis of the continental navy ) - - which is that for the purpose of the state being both secure * and * free , the people 's right to keep and bear arms should n't be infringed . 
  that is ; there is n't supposed to be a * monopoly * on the ability to use force . 
  obviously , as things like the whiskey rebellion showed , the state 's role * was * to be the ultimate legal power , but the anti-federalists agitated for the 2a 's inclusion in the constitution specifically to secure the right of americans in perpetuity to have much the same armaments as the national security forces . 
  well , here is much different . 
  in switzerland , they can purchase newly made machineguns , and do so in every cantonment .
