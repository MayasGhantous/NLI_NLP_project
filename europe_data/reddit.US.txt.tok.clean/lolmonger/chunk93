  this is * not * the case in the us , where our machinegun regulation was done as the part of the first federal gun laws at all wherein the congress did n't even think they could interfere with the 2a ( lol so quaint ! ), 
  and so passed the nfa as a taxation regime : requiring 200 dollars in depression era america to register machineguns , which previously could be owned unregistered like any other gun . 
  in 1986 , the fopa hughes amendment banned the new entry of any machinegun to the civilian ownership registry , so the stock of available machineguns to buy , on top of state restrictions , makes the ownership an insanely expensive affair . 
  you 're buying a tax stamp that gives you the right to possess a pre-1986 registered machinegun from a restricted pool , whereas in switzerland , you 're registering yourself and buying a gun . 
  i 'd much prefer their system of machinegun law if i had to pick . 
   i never really got the point of open carry on a practical level , it 's much easier to bring a weapon up to ready when it 's carried in a holster - - this is why cops do n't carry concealed . 
  on a historical basis : weapons were always carried openly , and it was the * concealment * of a deadly weapon that was something a person had to be permitted to do - - it was seen as a dishonorable indication . 
  that 's why plenty of us states with concealed carry permitting laws actually have no law constraining openly carried longarms or handguns . 
  ^ ^ both the czech republic and switzerland have * waaaaaaay * more lax gun laws than several us states and cities , both in terms of what kinds of weapons can be owned , how they can be used for defense ( if this is permissible at all ) , and where/how they can be carried . 
  this is generally the source of `` switzerland/cz are gun-paradise '' , when they 're comparably much stricter than most of the us . 
   maybe the right should stop whining and moaning and bitching about hispanics and start trying to attract them to their party but that would require them to actually treat minorities like human beings as a minority myself : 1 ) fuck off with this `` lol republican evil racists '' nonsense 2 ) when 11-15 million illegal immigrants are being amnestied in after repeated other amnesties , asking about why democrats are so continually interested in getting millions and millions of people from latin america 's polities who ** do ** vote differently is a fair question, 
  all we 're asking for is that a proper filtration unit be in place . 
  oh that 's why i followed it up with `` but have you had this other stuff at exactly the same time , because all of those options are available simultaneously ? '', 
  agreed . 
  i 'm a big fan of multiculturalism . 
  america 's music and food and movie game is unbeatable because of all the people we 've imported . 
  have you ever had pierogies ? 
  have you ever had them with arepas and dhokla in the same meal because you can get them at the same time made by people who know what they 're doing ? 
  this shit is unbelievably cool . 
  but we can not fracture who we are as a people to satisfy the economic mandates of people who will always have enough money to choose their neighbors and language and children 's environment . 
  we 're used to the brits having all kinds of extraneous vowels . 
  yep . 
  norad , which is the last stand of american nuclear/aerospace defense and perpetuity when the world comes to an end in fire , is staffed and run by americans ... * and canadians * . 
  americans with a different color scheme . 
  they 're not ` us ' , but my brother is n't ` me ' , either . 
   the cynic in me seems to think that this is the dark side of democracy : importing future voters .

  latinos are a majority in the us in several metropolitan areas and a few states , and that trend will continue . 
  they come from a culture with totally different expectations to the typical american centrist on firearms and taxation and social spending ... but ** not ** ones different from the assumptions of the american left . 
  http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dch/programs/healthycommunitiesprogram/tools/pdf/hispanic_latinos_insight.pdf ** even the cdc , when given the parochial duty of health outreach will say something like ** :  understand that hispanics/latinos are assimilating to prevalent u. s. culture , but they are not , and probably never will be , fully assimilated . 
  instead , theirs is a path of acculturation . 
  it is a process of integration of native and traditional immigrant cultural values with dominant cultural ones ( sonderup , 2010 ) http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395 the powers that be literally want to undermine national identities by importing other people , remaking electorates and electorate demands to better suit their agendas . 
  the left in europe and the left in america both make the same apologies for mass migration of ` the other ' ( even if it is illegally done by uncontrolled/untracked migrant populations ) because they 're coming from polities which imbue those populations with a culture and therefore social expectations that are in keeping with the agendas of the left . 
   is n't having your nationality defined by your ethnicity kind of a terrible idea ? 
  unless your nation exists on a continent everyone had to sail to because their life in the many ( all still racially/linguistically/culturally similar ) different nations on an older continent were n't necessarily going to be better than making a new life in a place where some other entire races are pushed out ... 
  it 's kind of inevitable that ethnic - that is , genetic and linguistic identity ( so often being linked because of the reality of language acquisition and biological propagation happening parent to child ) - identity is entirely a peoples identity by incident . 
  even the native americans , hundreeds of peoples and nations between them , had ethnicity and conflicts between each other 's acquisition of land on these grounds . 
  that we can have first lt. zhao and ssgt . 
  miller and cpl. 
  kaczynski all salute the same flag , shout/hear orders in the same language , and all fight and die for the same nation should , frankly , astound you . 
  this is a nation wherein chinese/asian , senegal/african , polish/slavic all can be melted away into whether or not someone 's got the stars and stripes on their shoulder patch - without an empire subjugating those people 's ` homelands ' like the romans did . 
  this country is their homeland !, 
  this is simply just * not * how it has ever worked before . 
  they have people with armored vehicles and automatic weapons . 
  america is different . 
  the first president to be born here did n't even have english as his first language . 
  i 'm just saying , i do n't think every other place is like us in terms of not really having a genetically determined ethnic identity , because ideological membership in the polity is so strong . 
   most religions have weird hang-ups and rules about sex and sexuality . 
  most religions were the political and social and existential governance and culture and explanatory framework of every civilization that created them , and sex and sexuality happen to be the mode of reproduction and the expectations surrounding/determining reproduction . 
  that sexuality intersects with/plays a big role in religions is hardly surprising . 
  is it ? 
  would someone of entirely korean genetic heritage ever * truly * be gambian , even if they were born and raised speaking only wolof and mandinka and knew no home other than the gambia ? 
  ethnicity as a combination of genetic , linguistic , and cultural heritage and norms all play a role in identity . 
  certain identities are much less dependent on each ingredient . 
  an `` american '' is basically what the fuck ever genetically , but our culture and language are pretty much set . 
  a german ... i do n't know if someone can be truly german if they immigrate there and acquire german as a second language . 
  a cabbie in nyc whose third language is english and whose nation of origin is bangladesh and who lives only with other bengali people is clearly a new yorker and has an american identity if they choose to have it . 
  it 's hard to imagine america without a city like new york and bewildering diversity is part of that . 
  our identity is cultural , primarily . 
  but what about a korean ? 
  can a redheaded , freckled , celtic blooded person born in seol , raised there , and reading and writing in hangul before they ever hear about ireland * really * be korean ? 
  i 'm very suspicious of the notion that every country is like the us . 
  some nations , peoples and identities really do rest on ethnic and * genetic * determiners of ethnicity on top of their linguistic and cultural ones . 
  pretty obviously , at a minimum , genetic membership in certain , but not other families * exists * . 
  who 's to say that could never be part of a national identity ? 
  i use ` progressive ' or ` the left ' for this reason . 
  for the beers and firearms and women . 
  just like the czech republic . 
   they had no representation at all ? 
  or was it so little that they could n't ever influence anything at all * boy sounds like you should go read about it if you do n't know that *  they were colonies , not a sovereign entity , why would they need representation ? 
  the acts of union in 1706 meant that scotland and england were n't sovereign , but joined in the kingdom of great britain , and they had representation in parliament . 
   are you still reading ? 
  did you ever start ? 
   you go on thinking the colonists did it they wanted to be free . 
  they were n't slaves . 
  no , they were not enslaved , but they had no voice in the policies that governed them , told on the one hand they were british subjects with obligations to the crown and yet on the other british subjects owed no fair treatment by the crown . 
  so they elected to no longer be british . 
  it * would * be totally preposterous for america to write canadian laws , for something like nafta to evolve into a us dominated polity that had power over constituent states . 
  this basic loss of sovereignty * in principle * , not merely by effect , not a de facto weak position in negotiating trade , but a * de jure * position of subordination of the united kingdom towards the ` european union ' and the powers within it that have the most control is itself precisely what the brexit issue is about . 
  if this were purely about economics , no one would ever expect anything but a remain vote - - - - but gilded servants quarters are only that , and a rough cabin in one 's own land might be infinitely preferable to a stock of people that retain pride and grit . 
  it was * economically foolish * for the colonists to think they could do much better than the empire . 
  these united states were a complete backwater compared to most of europe until the industrial revolution was nearly done . 
  but penury of wealth , for people who can not put a price on their own freedom , on their own sovereignty , is not an expense at all compared to a poverty of liberties . 
  * adorable . 
   okay , call me a racist or what ever , i do n't care , this is a genuine question , if we 're going trough on the complete diversity train in europe and america , where exactly will the white people be in the majority ? 
  ** nowhere ** http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/13/18934111-census-white-majority-in-us-gone-by-2043 https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/race.world i find it interesting , as a non-white person , that most whites seem not to care : https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-05-19/whites-surprisingly-chill-about-becoming-minority i do n't even live in india , but the idea that india would one day not be filled with a majority of people who speak indian languages , have brown skin and black hair , practice south asian customs and religions , and instead be populated mostly by people from * outside * india , * outside * south asia ( say , east asians , or europeans , or arabs ) is incomprehensibly sad . 
  also , unlike the european/american example , unrealistic . 
  indians have kids . 
   it is more of a tradition for me fun fact : that 's pretty much what it is for the majority of the world 's hindus , coming from a tradition that 's vastly older * and * indigenous to their people , unlike christianity as it was brought to the slavs ( relatively recently ) . 
  very few of us hindus in the west subscribe to theistic notions , but it 's * our heritage * that we keep alive , because the religious tradition was linked to so much of our culture and what makes us , us . 
  that 's why i ca n't understand how willing some sectors of the west are to just throw the baby out with the bathwater . 
  what do you have , if you do n't have your own people ? 
  your own identity ? 
  your history ? 
  europe is culturally orphaning itself , even if it is n't committing patricide . 
  could it be that the broad character of the anti-brexit argument has rested on these two contradictory opinions , voiced at different periods , depending on the likelihood of a leave vote ? 
   a brexit would deprive the dutch of an important ally in their desire to reduce the european union to a simple business venture . 
  but this extremely narrow conception of the purpose of pan\u2011european cooperation is exactly why the eu might , contrary to most popular opinion , benefit from a brexit . 
  the united kingdom did n't join and stay inside the eu to make something of it , but rather , to prevent others from making something of it . 
  `` omg , brexit supporters are paranoid about single government statehood of the eu ! '',
