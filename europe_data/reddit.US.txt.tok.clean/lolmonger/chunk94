  __________________ which is it , guys ? 
  is the united kingdom being irrational for making a mountain out of a molehill when it comes to fear about a transnational european polity which supplants and obviates national governments ? 
  or is the uk being unimaginative and regressive for refusing to contribute to a european identity and state framework for internationalist ideals to push europa forward into a new age ? 
  which one is it ? 
   devon should succeed from the uk , the uk gubmint does n't know what is best for devon !, 
  devon retains a local government subordinate to , but independently acting from , the government of the united kingdom : https://new.devon.gov.uk/ precisely because nearly every democratic republic recognizes that even if there is legal supremacy , the actual logistics of people making good representative decisions when popularly installed as representatives requires a measure of fit between an electorate and decisions made . 
   i succeed from plymouth !, 
  notably , the government representatives of the united kingdom , devon , and plymouth * can not * legally tell you to do * anything and everything * about your life - - - ** most ** of your own life 's policies are actually ** your ** choices , not theirs , in practice . 
  this is literally the import of being a ` free ' citizen in a democratic , republican , government in the west , and not a ` subject ' . 
  more entrants means more competition for the same resources unless their entry means resource availability increases commensurately !, 
  unless another guy coming to wings and beer night at the bar is bringing enough money to buy n +1 pitchers/buckets , you 're going to have fewer wings and less beer to go around in the group . 
  who should be listening to whom ? 
  whose concerns matter more ? 
  which are the people of a nation whose material angst matters more ; the comfortable or the vulnerable ? 
   what the fuck does staying in the eu have to do with eventually choosing to join a potential european army ?? 
  because the eu 's tendency has been to act more authoritatively as a state with regards to policy making than a framwork for inter-national policy agreement , and to act more authoritatively as a state with regards to economic and currency policy than as an international framework for an economic zone and currency . 
  the tendency of the eu in the future will be to act more authoritatively as a state with regards to an eu military ( right now , still nation controlled battlegroups ) than it is an international framework for military cooperation between different governments . 
   if the eu decides to create an eu army what does this mean , though ? 
  who commands an eu army ? 
  where do the troops come from ? 
  are they * only * eu troops , or are they also soldiers of constituent nations ? 
  do those nations have final command authority over them ? 
  do those nations which are currently sovereign members of the eu , in this situation , still exist as independent sovereign nations ? 
  do they retain their own militaries in parallel with an eu military ? 
  where is this eu military garrisoned ? 
  * who * is the commander in chief ? 
  are they elected ? 
  who elects them ? 
  eu citizens ? 
  do those citizens all retain citizenship in constituent nations of the eu ? 
  are there any * sole * eu citizens ? 
  ** nothing ** sensible can be said about the retention of nuclear weapons , or even something like aircraft carriers , without answering all of these questions about what it means to have an eu military . 
  what is an eu military , and what does it imply about the eu ? 
  is the eu a polity ? 
  a true state ? 
  is it superior to any member state ? 
  does it exist separate of those member states ? 
  where is it located ? 
  is it just a policy agreement ? 
  i 'm not even really sure who `` europeans '' are in a * political * sense . 
  the stigma of the troubles/stereotypes of drunken loutery is probably what they 're referring to . 
  [ who wore it better ?

  how 'd you vote in the scottish national referendum ? 
  do you think there 's a correlation between the two votes ? 
   the eu is better than the usa already . 
  ahh , but we 're an actual country ; a nation-state . 
  the eu is a hodge podge policy union . 
  it either becomes a nation with a currency and supreme government ( and military ) , or it breaks up . 
  right now different sovereign nations exist in the eu . 
  either they become only as `` real '' as england/scotland/etc . 
  are within the uk , or pennsylvania and texas are within the us ( i.e. 
  no longer sovereign nations ) , or the eu dies . 
  the uk sees that , and decides it would rather be independent and small than subsumed and part of something large but not its own . 
  an entire country of normal people with whom so many cultural and historical features are shared with pro-eu nations ca n't be simply be unreasonable , alien , and stupid . 
  i 'm pretty far to the right , but i have no delusions about why people legitimately hold views further left than mine . 
  simply put , people get to have different values and perspectives . 
  if they agree with what you think is correct , you 've done a decent job addressing their concerns and worries and appealing to their priorities and values . 
  if they disagree , you have n't . 
  that there is profound , widespread disagreement over what the eu is , what the european project means for individual nations and their own decision making , and what kind of rule the united kingdom has within it , is a failure on the part of the eu and westminster to respectfully , consciously address the anxieties of millions and millions of britons . 
   basically we 're looking for people who are interested in the result of the referendum and will be following it live . 
  all you have to do is post any new pieces of information that are happening to the live thread , whether it 's a tweet , link to an article or just quoting what you heard a newsreader say . 
  is n't it just shit that reddit still does n't have proper live thread tools for this ? 
  ** big thanks ** in advance to the moderators of / r/europe and whatever brave souls volunteer to do this . 
   this is just fantasy . 
  you 're the one invoking hypothetical after hypothetical when a decades long nato alliance has lasted . 
  just face it ; the us created a unified policy framework for europe decades before the eu , and it might be one that outlives the eu as well . 
   if an alliance consists in 95 % or more of european countries , then it ca n't be said that a `` european problem '' is n't a problem of this alliance . 
  so why the fuck ca n't the eu do something ? 
  it does n't matter what the percentage numbers are , you 're asking for me to be hunky fucking dory with more us troops being put at risk in a european war , where the europeans wo n't even pass harsh economic sanctions on russia first . 
  and what the fuck do you guys spend on nato ? 
  unfucking believable . 
  i 'll be clear : if a ukrainian patriot assassinated vladimir putin for what he 's done in ukraine , i think it would be a justified , retributive act of war . 
  but that 's no reason for the us to fight someone else 's fight on behalf of people who wo n't even themselves spend the money and put up the troops to help . 
  i hope ukraine someday can take all of ukraine back . 
  there 's no reason for us troops to go to war there , least of all while eu nations also in nato will do business with the russians , and not contribute the bare fucking minimum to nato defense . 
  they 're currently freaking out over trump , too . 
  * soon *, 
   it seems like you never heard about budapest memorandum 1994 , of course i have . 
  the fact that europe did n't join the us in complete and indefinite sanctions on russia for what it 's done basically means nuclear non proliferation is dead , forever . 
  no one will ever gove up nukes again . 
  however , that agreement was only one that said all signatories would respect ukrainian sovereignty . 
  russia is the only traitor here . 
  ukraine is n't in nato , either - they 're not covered by article . 
  what i find objectively stupid , is that instead of any proximal responsibility for helping ukraine falling to all of the wealthy , developed nations of europe right next door , it has to be the us everyone calls again . 
  nope . 
  hardly any of those nations have contributed to nato on agreed terms for decades , hardly have made investments in real military hardware , hardly any have appreciable numbers of troops . 
  this is a european problem much more than it is a nato problem , and look at how the eu has responded . 
  look at how most western european nations have responded . 
  why should the us get involved if the europeans do n't even care about their own problems ? 
  how about no . 
  i really hope the ukrainians can , somehow , eventually take their country back , but i 'm done with the us being the world 's policeman for free . 
   then how about change that before not enough time . 
  have to change eu status first before a rework of the uk . 
  a euro denominated bond , but bonds whose repayment responsibility is of the german government , as opposed to say , greece .
