  keep it up ! '', 
  so , he should come off the executive committee , or russia 's team should be kicked out of the tournament , basically . 
   everything he said sounds like alt-right copypasta memes . 
  fun fact : some of the best / pol / shitposting just comes from rehashing what politicians say themselves .

   little `` pastafarians '' i do n't think you can make something a slur if it 's cute . 
  you know , i disagree with you a lot , but i do enjoy our back and forth . 
  alright , nicole . 
   the us feels more threatened by russia than most of europe ( if you take eastern europe out of the equation ) . 
  what a german thing to write . 
  yeah , you see kumpel , that 's the reason we 're questioning nato 's relevance . 
  think we 're trying to annex iraq ? 
  i 'm ashamed the us has been carrying out the neoliberal/neocon vision of intervention and imposed stability for the sake of global markets for 30 years now , but we 're hardly trying to take over parts of canada because we think we own them . 
  i just assumed you all played as one uk team . 
  he does n't need to admit to his mistake ; he needs only be given the options of his and russia 's self-destruction on the one hand , and acting like a fucking reasonable person on the other . 
  he has billions , he has power , etc. 
  but he 's ultimately just a 63 year old man . 
  he eats , sleeps , shits , and bleeds just like you and me . 
  worse , probably . 
  his power is a result of the thing all leaders with power have ; people believe they are the appropriate wielders of power - - out of everything from familial loyalty to indoctrination to genuine patriotism to a lack of imagination or formal education to transactional self interest makes them think that , and in the aggregate , they allow that individual power . 
  every society with a leader is some kind of democracy , twisted or not . 
  everyone but a family member ( and even some of them ) makes some kind of calculation about whether whoever is in charge * should * be in charge . 
  do you think the molodezhnoye antifashistskoye ` nashi ' types will support putin if they see that they can not have their own future because the russian federation 's economy is collapsing ? 
  do you think the oligarchs will support putin if they see their money is n't acceptable to invest in safety net apartments in london and new york ? 
  if their bank accounts held in dollars or euros are at risk ? 
  if the russian government does n't want to accept that they live in an international community where we do n't just annex nations and occupy them by force and stoke little revolutions in order to seize territory because of some un-assuaged irredentist butthurt left over from the cold war , then they * should be obliged * and be left to live outside that international community . 
  that 's why the sanctions need to come back . 
  let them withhold their petroleum . 
  let them withhold their - - oh wait , that 's their only real export . 
  let them have less and less food , variety and quantity . 
  let them do without antibiotics . 
  let them watch as even the nicest parts of moscow start to look a bit shabby and the best foreign professors do n't come back to skolkovo . 
  putin wo n't have to admit anything . 
  to be fair , the two guys at the start of that video are the sort who elected to wear their baseball caps backwards . 
  often , american english speakers use `` britain '' to mean `` the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland '' , and `` british '' to mean , people from the british isles - - we 're fully aware that northern ireland and the republic of ireland are n't the same country , that n. ireland is one of the constituent nations of the uk , the history of the acts of union , etc. 
  all that . 
  english , scottish , irish , and welsh people , ethnically , predominate in england , scotland , * northern * ireland , and wales , and `` british '' often gets used to refer to all of them , without the suggestion that this means irish people are somehow under an anglo yoke . 
  i totally , totally did not mean in any way to suggest anything untoward about the sovereignty or history of the irish republic . 
  come to america , i have recently required an ar-180 , my family is south asian and i had relatives killed by the brits in india , we can talk shiite about the english all day . 
  really ? 
  i think it 's quite obvious - - - because finland is vastly more homogeneous than the uk , there 's never any cause for racial resentment about wealth transfers or deprioritization of status , on top of finland 's welfare system apparently being executed much more efficiently as a system of aid , than perpetual support . 
  that 's because , on the whole , the finnish welfare system seems to accomplish what welfare systems are supposed to , and principally benefit finnish people - - whereas the british people probably look on the outcomes of welfare in the united kingdom as dismal , and principally for the benefit of those whom they feel are permanent costs and foreign elements . 
  in the finnish example , you have material receipt by finns based on material collection from finns , to the effect of providing social safety and mobility for those finns who are unfortunate , supplied by those finns who are fortunate . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_finland finland has a * far * more homogeneous population than does the united kingdom , which has seen [ increases in the number of non-british and non-eu nationals ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11255425/how-much-do-immigrants-really-claim-in-benefits.html ) receiving welfare . 
  it can be downplayed - obviously , most people ` on the dole ' in britain are british , in ethnicity ( being english , scottish , irish , and welsh ) and often at least in being people of longtime citizenship/heritage citizenship as british people who merely have a different ethnic origin - but it can not be denied that plenty of * non * british and * not even eu * - origin people get british taxpayer money . 
  a very different circumstance from finland . 
  that coupled with more and more migration of visibly non-british , non-european people , particularly in a time of economic pain for working and middle class british people , engenders a feeling of the country * not prioritizing its own people * . 
  unless this basic resentment is reckoned with , there will ** always ** be a wound in the british public 's perception of welfare compared to what exists in finland , and as immigration increases and the lot of ethnically british people becomes one with fiercer and fiercer competition ( both for those on welfare and not on welfare ) , that wound will fester . 
  you know , if someone said `` it 's just bit of banter ! '', 
  after ejaculating on your dead nan 's face during her wake , you still might be angry at them for having crossed a line or two of yours . 
   japan ? 
  are those world powers ? 
  i mean , if you 're really asking , there 's no world power but the united states of america . 
  everyone else is a regional power . 
  by any estimate , though , yeah the uk is up there along with japan , s. korea , china , germany , france they 're a significant regional power , and intimately involved in many international frameworks of power . 
   it 's how international law works . 
  international laws and treaties * generally * involve the conduct of one nation with respect to another . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermediate-range_nuclear_forces_treaty that is a treaty , between the us and ussr/successor states in which the parties mutually agreed * not * to develop certain weapons capacities that gave each a far too horrible and a far difficult to counter power to destroy the other than it was believed to be safe to retain . 
  the eu 's rule making , its [ absolute arrogance ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/2200026/eu-constitution-author-says-referendums-can-be-ignored.html ) where as a central power it believes it can , as an unelected group of commission functionaries , is the usurpation of rule of law and mutual assent by treaty with a * yoke * under which sovereign nations are placed . 
  were the eu to merely be an international treaty organization that facilitated common agreements between the uk and germany and france , etc etc. 
  so that their governments could acede or * not * acede to common policies , that would be one thing - - - what the eu has turned into instead , is a supranational government . 
  equal partners in the marriage bed vs a non-consensual dom-sub basement sex dungeon sure , there 's coitus , but they 're hardly equal scenarios . 
   i was under the impression it made hitler look completely deranged . 
  this is a popular thing said to pooh pooh hitler , along with his speeches being said to be the rantings of a mad man . 
  he was actually * super [ charismatic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycqr2hnf1au ) * as a speaker , the [ rallies ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l1cgyadm_o8/u_kcnepikxi/aaaaaaaajva/ywp8znvosky/s1600/nazi%2brally,%2b1937..jpg ) were hugely popular , and if we were german people in the 1930s exposed to [ nordicism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_race#nordicism ) and the promise of revenge against the european powers that had humiliated us ... 
  ... i mean ... probably we would read mein kampf a whole lot differently than a modern audience . 
   so you like us !, 
  hey now - - we do n't want to see hessians getting too friendly with the brits again ... 
   i belong to a minority in my country . 
  nationalism , from the majority here and from my own ethnic group notice how you 're using the word `` nationalism '' and talking about inter-ethnic tensions ? 
   that sounds like peaceful communism . 
  nothing about what he 's written involves collective ownership of the means of production . 
  what you 're thinking about is how it solves the problems of what marx called ` alienation ' . 
   if this country had more multi-cultural ideas going around , it would n't have such backward ideas . 
  or maybe , just maybe , the person you 're replying to is pointing out that there are barbaric cultures which * ought * be excluded in favor of preserving monocultures in which being raped is n't a crime . 
   the biggest different is the lack of democracy in the region ? 
  why do you think there 's a lack of democracy ? 
  and what do you suppose would be the outcome of a fully democratic institution in a country like qatar as goes their sex crime laws ? 
  this just seems like local quatar news . 
  sounds like y' all need to get the fuck outta dodge . 
   do we really want to do this ? 
  do you look at the proto-polity that is the european union and seen in its policy choices and cultural goals , a society that you wish to take greater precedence in your life than that of the united kingdom as you currently know it ? 
  do you see among the eu 's economic policies , defense policies , domestic policies - - do you see among its leaders and power brokers - - - a system which conforms to the best of your interests and ideals ? 
  or at * least * one which does so better than the united kingdom does now ? 
   which is easy if you have the legal right to buy one and pretty hard if you do n't as illegal gun-dealers can hardly adverise their business . 
  what planet are you on ? 
  do you not understand that illegal weapons sales happen ** all the time ** and are how the terrorists acquired their guns for the paris attacks in the first place ? 
  they did n't go to a sporting goods store . 
   and considering that your average islamic terrorist is not especially inclined to survive of course they are - - they 'll do anything and everything they can to survive and stay hidden and get armed long enough to kill people . 
  that 's literally what makes them terrorists . 
  i 'm done , speaking with you is like talking to a wall . 
   you can not compare drm to guns , the comparison with downloadable content and physical objects is fundamentally flawed . 
  * that , if you paid attention , was not what i was comparing * i 'll state it unambiguously : * punitive lawmaking that does n't interact with lawbreakers only punishes the lawful , not the lawbreaking * drm that means people need to re-validate their already legal purchase over and over and jump through more and more hoops ... and which * does n't at all * apply to pirates who just obtain drm free illegally downloaded content , is * exactly * like firearms laws the eu is proposing - - - laws that serve only to make it harder and harder for regular people to obtain firearms , and do * nothing * to impede criminals who never dealt with the channels being regulated . 
   entire argument is that having little regulation and a lot of guns available actually makes it easier for criminals to procure them   a lot of guns available     a lot of guns available            a lot of guns available do you just not understand that passing these laws has ** no ** effect on the availability of firearms for people willing to break laws ? 
  in ** no ** way do these eu laws interact with any mechanism of acquisition that the terrorists used to obtain their firearms . 
  this is like putting a speed limit of 25 km/h on a motorway that used to have a speed limit of 50 km/h , while doing * nothing * about the people driving their vehicles on sidewalks , running people over , one city over . 
    the new rules tighten online sales of arms and components , restrict inheritance rules and ban civilian possession of most semi-automatic firearms . 
  1 ) there 's no evidence the terrorists used the internet to buy their weapons 2 ) pretty sure they did n't all have uncles who died and then inherited automatic kalashnikovs 3 ) banning civilians from owning rifles ... guaranteed to stop terrorists who murder !, 
  ___________ the same eu that pushes this : http://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/eu-gives-facebook-twitter-youtube-8089780 is the same eu that wants to ban as many people as possible from owning weapons . 
  thank god we have the 2a and 4a .
