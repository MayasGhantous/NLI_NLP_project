   the reasoning behind that is simply to make guns harder to procure and thereby increase the amount of effort someone has to take to get guns . 
  terrorists were n't making use of legal channels to begin with . 
  gun laws that make it harder and harder for people to legally obtain firearms are like drm which interfere more and more with people who just want to play their fucking movie they bought , while pirates just go ahead and open up file they torrented . 
   somehow those illegal suppliers need to get their stuff yeah , and they 're not exactly following the laws , either . 
   it 's not like they can openly advertise their business either . 
  * because they 're not following laws . 
   scottish independence failed because westminster threw everything at scotland in the last week . 
  you do n't think that 's going to happen before the 23rd of this month ? 
   and which opposition is that ? 
  before any brexit even happens , i 'm supposed to name specific party officials who i think might be amenable to accepting automotive industry campaign funding ? 
  i mean , okay . 
   germany and sch\u00e4uble will also obviously consider the interests of the car industry in a new tariff with the uk . 
  yes , that 's part of why i think sch\u00e4uble 's current statement is mostly just a jab at british nationals than it is a real threat . 
  butthurt  not granting access to the single market without abiding to the rules of the single market does not mean not trade , not even close to that . 
  the us and germany are not part of a single market either ... again , yeah , that 's why i think sch\u00e4uble is * mostly * just spouting for no reason here ... ... but it 's entirely true that if the uk were to have an ** unfavorable ** trade position , with ** some room ** for policy to gain them similar or the same position they have now with respect to germany - - a lot of german industry would in fact lobby government/fund campaigns , etc. 
  i do n't know how that 's an extraordinary idea to you . 
   and why would the automotive industry want to `` bribe '' german politicians so that the uk does not impose tariffs on them did i say that ? 
  i think the german automotive industry has every incentive , should german represenation in the eu not be amenable to market access within the eu for british money , to fund their opposition eventually . 
   also which political group do you think they would fund if they wanted to fund the political opponents of sch\u00e4uble to achieve their goals ? 
  it 's too soon to tell , i think , but it could be anything but down ticket races and internal party competitors in * existing * party establishment , to simply - as you put it - merely paying ` bribes ' to current political groups to influence the eu . 
  no matter what , the principle is the same : the uk has a lot of money in it . 
  private industries in the eu , if the uk were to no longer be a member of the eu , would still want uk nationals and banks to be able to do * as much business as legally possible * with them . 
  thus - every incentive to influence how possible the greatest extent of business is !, 
   one has to respect the sovereignty of the british people if he hoped his statement would be received as a sober warning against a leave vote , he probably should n't have said that . 
  the basic tension underlying the entire brexit campaign is that the eu wants to subvert national governments by putting them all under control of self appointed functionaries - - like a german finance minister being on a eu council , and thus as a german , controlling britain . 
  we do n't have financial constraints on our budget , only political fights . 
  sorry , we only read words that describe how to cure cancer . 
  no , but they might want a government that would allow british located money just as much freedom to buy their products outside the eu as in it . 
  until the russian people effect change in the russian government 's policies , i do n't think this should prompt * any * relenting on sanctions from the west . 
  having a place in the system of shared trade and finance so that state pensions can enable the elderly/less fortunate of a society to obtain medicines - - to the extent that it depends on acceptance by the west - - simply is n't something the russian government is entitled to while it supports the killing in occupied ukraine through its proxies . 
  the principle responsibility of russia should be towards the welfare of its own people ; not the perpetuation of warfare in sovereign nations abroad . 
  if the federation is * so poor * that it can not ensure the health of its elderly while it annexes parts of sovereign nations , seems to me that either putin , or the population that has such high regard for him , will simply have to be left to time alone to figure out which of those activities is more worthwhile . 
   we believe that the eastern flank and its security should be strengthened through the deployment of combined us-nato forces `` combined '' the us just needs to negotiate defense terms with those allies of ours who actually give two shits about burden sharing and cooperation and exit nato . 
   our efforts to counter the further federalization of eu . 
  if you do n't want the federalization of the eu , get out of the eu while you still can . 
   this african mass-migration to europe consists of the underperformers of africa . 
  the chronically unemployed , the criminals , the bums , et cetera . 
  when africa sends its people , they 're not sending they 're best ... 
   now that denmark is feeling the heat , this ` citizen ' is no longer welcome . 
  perhaps a state should not hand out citizenships to individuals that the state is not willing to accept , for good and for bad . 
  yeah , like the people who buy your argument would * ever * accept denmark refusing this guy citizenship in the first place because of who he is . 
  culture is like a symphony orchestra 's performance . 
  there are many woodwind , brass , percussion , and stringed instruments - - there is n't just one oboe , or just two violins . 
  they are n't all even playing the same parts . 
  but they 're playing a coherent * composition * , with each single one contributing to a larger whole , in * harmony * . 
  if one violinist were to play out of key , to play with the wrong tempo , to not put rosin on his untuned strings - - - the performance would not be ruined . 
  you might not even hear him . 
  the signal to noise ratio would be so low . 
  but what about another violinist ? 
  and what about another ? 
  and suppose they are joined by a discordant brass player ... whose performance not only disagrees with the rest of the players , but * agrees with the rogue violinists ? 
  * even if their music was a beautifully composed piece - - - there would be * disharmony * . 
  how much room is there in the concert hall ? 
   what differs between europe and the us is having them at home . 
  also heatwaves where thousands and thousands of people 's elderly family members are cooked to death . 
   evil aggressors [ but eet ees the whole of russia det ess called aggressor !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlesb4eqqri ) my favorite piece of modern propaganda . 
  none of this would be happening if russia did n't respond to a popular uprising in a sovereign nation with a military invasion and annexation of that nation 's territory when its people decided they wanted to get rid of an unpopular government and accede to the eu . 
  two actual laws in switzerland : 1 ) mandatory military conscription for the defense of the nation , weapons often kept at home in reserves . 
  2 ) if you keep a social animal like a guinea pig as a pet , you have to get two because they 're prone to becoming lonely . 
  just wonderful . 
  they 're excellent in everything except promoting themselves . 
  the strongest , most beautiful , most successful , smartest , kindest , etc. 
  people in the world ... if they have * no * enduring preference for self over nonself , will vanish . 
  this is n't a ` race ' thing , either . 
  i 'm sure the dalmatian 's and prussian 's genes live on . 
  no one speaks dalmatian . 
  there are new prussian newscasters . 
  they are as a people , even if their descendants are prolific , extinct . 
   she does n't really have any strong convictions to any ideology beyond what gets her elected . 
  weird how those convictions and pandering appeals seem to be firmly left of center , though , huh ? 
   when it comes to foreign policy she 's a hawkish neocon literally a political ideology created by trotskyists . 
  they 're conservative only in co-opting conservative ideas about having a strong defensive apparatus - - they 're martial neoliberals , globalists . 
  not right wing . 
   pretty neoliberal economically with her free trade deals again , not right wing . 
  the right wing embraced [ protectionism ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=eesucwaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa187&amp;dq=it+is+for+exactly+this+reason+that+the+questions+of+global+competition,+economic+dislocation,+and+their+repercussions+for+western+europe%27s+labor+force&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiwyqtdjjtnahujmz4khemrcw0q6aeihtaa#v=onepage&amp;q=it%20is%20for%20exactly%20this%20reason%20that%20the%20questions%20of%20global%20competition%2c%20economic%20dislocation%2c%20and%20their%20repercussions%20for%20western%20europe's%20labor%20force&amp;f=false ) against dissolution and degeneracy of trade and land control on the left . 
   she 's against single-payer healthcare . 
  https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/health-care/ she 's basically milton friedman !, 
  what you think she 's part of the right ? 
  that she 's an authoritarian does n't mean she 's not left of center . 
  the fact she seeks for most authority to be vested in the state , instead of the church is traditional leftism . 
  that 's not necessarily indoctrination . 
  evolutionary theory is a correct , evidence based explanation ( and predictive tool ) for how we understand species ' change . 
  the scientific method in total , the idea of measuring and testing to seek truth , is pretty indisputable . 
  unless you 're willing to degenerate truth with untruth , and claim all perspectives are the same , you ca n't really say indoctrination exists when someone is taught a truth and made inclined to reject others . 
  maybe i 'm being a zealot . 
  just a thought : take * everything * people will say about this christian school , and apply it to any muslim school . 
  now imagine the person saying those things does n't employ particularly sophisticated sentence structures , ` as a reaw ` arsh voice , yeah ? 
  and has more closely cropped hair than most other young white men . 
  what do you suppose the reception of the putative limits the state should impose , in that case , would be ? 
  [ keep 'em coming , ivan !,

  neocons would be saying we need to install missiles in taiwan or some bullshit . 
   not so long ago in the usa the state identity took precedence over the national one . 
  only in the sense of political control - - not in the sense of culture , religion , and language . 
  to this day , that persists , actually , in part by design ; i know what someone thinks about gun control ( with near certainty ) if it comes up that they 're from texas , or from california , or from vermont , or from illinois . 
  even more so if you go into the regions of those states . 
  i know very much what it means to be appalachian , or from the bible belt . 
  new englanders are a certain way . 
  southerners another .
