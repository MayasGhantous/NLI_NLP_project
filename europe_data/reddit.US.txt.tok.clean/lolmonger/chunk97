  midwesterners another . 
  when it comes to the actual policy differences that make up a big number of our federal fights , you can pretty much always look back at what cultural divisions there are in terms of where people are from and how they live . 
  * europe has that ten fold *  until the civil war , even the name the united states of america was plural . 
  hell , i still say `` these united states '' when i refer to the polity 's need to do something or another as a union . 
   national identities change and new ones emerge . 
  i 'm not contesting that , i 'm just saying ** you will have to destroy the idea and identity ** of being * french * , * german * , * montenegrin * , * irish * , * portuguese * , etc. 
  and have a monoculture , monolanguage identity ready and waiting . 
  ** we had that ** in the us before the civil war , as americans , and we adopted a different version of it after the civil war ( especially after ww1 ) . 
  europe does n't at all . 
  the cart is being put several miles ahead of not even a horse , but a newborn colt . 
  switzerland is ** tiny ** , and the point of its existence as a polity is to be completely neutral , un-involved on the world stage , and provide nice banking laws . 
  it has incredible economic development , and nearly no poverty , with little earning differentials among its people . 
  it has hundreds of thousands of non-citizens in and out of its borders every single day . 
  you might as well point to the vatican and say it 's a scalable example of a multilingual state as well . 
  i 'm not saying there 's anything * wrong * with switzerland , i 'm just saying , you might as well look at a single family dwelling on central park west and conclude you know everything there is about the material conditions of life and thus urban policy in nyc . 
  `` we 're at war , but we 're going to have apples '' was just heartbreaking . 
  i do n't know how their neighbors in europe can look at this and be mostly worried about when the subject of new gas and trade initiatives with russia can come back to the bargaining table . 
   who would have known i would be irish , living in spain and having a hungarian girlfriend ? 
  we 're entering a new age where we ca n't just section ourselves away and make excuses to do so . 
  but are you eventually going to have a hungarian wife ? 
  and where will you two live ? 
  spain ? 
  and what language do you two speak to one another ? 
  ( i suspect it 's english ) , and if the kids grow up speaking spanish , will they necessarily want to leave spain where they grew up ? 
  there can not be a `` united states of europe '' ( or even a yet more powerful eu ) unless the political sovereignty of each state within it is ** dissolved ** , with hungary and germany being little more `` real '' as nations as delaware and texas . 
  furthermore , there can not be `` europeans '' like there are americans , until i can speak ( whatever it will be ) the native language of nearly all `` europeans '' from the time of the country 's founding to the present . 
  america has no ` official language ' and after 1965 's immigration bill , we 've seen a massive influx of foreigners . 
  if you learn english , you can talk to all americans , and almost all speak it natively . 
  most speak it * only * . 
  what is the european language ? 
  what is the european identity ? 
  the european history ? 
  there is no cultural europe , and there is no european nation . 
  one can be a german : ethnically , culturally , linguistically , civically . 
  one can be , actually , several combinations of those with some absence on what passport/voting right/tax obligation is held , and what sense of shared history there is , and what genetic makeup shared with the others is there , etc. 
  but it means something , quite specific , for someone to be german , and * not * american , or russian or whatever . 
  it means something to say `` i am not african , or slavic , i am german '' . 
  it means something to say `` ich verstehen sie nicht , ich kann deutsche '' to a query `` aap ka hindi atha hain ? '' . 
  it means something for someone to reject the idea of laziness and disrespect for teachers and knock on their desk and say `` i am german !, 
  of course i do my w\u00f6rk '' . 
  it means soemtjing is for someone to say `` afd/pegida is utter shit , i wo n't vote for them , a choice i can make because i am german '' these meanings * do n't * exist for `` european '' - it 's too commingled with `` western '' . 
  it 's more a facet of geography than it is ties of obligation and history . 
  to wit : when russia attacked ukraine - was that one european nation invading another ? 
  and does n't that come with inherent obligations on the part of the * european * community to stop it ? 
  sounds like the united kingdom is interested in being and defining a regional power . 
   britain grew exponentially during the empire , when it had access to the resources and manpower of a single , global common market . 
  when the decision making about greater resources is left up to you to prioritize for your own benefit , you do well . 
  an office workers who does n't own anything but his own labor working at a billion dollar company is hardly `` an emperor '' . 
  being in control of one 's own shit , especially when it 's not a huge downgrade , is vastly preferable to being only one of many around something you do n't own . 
  it 's aged pretty poorly graphics wise . 
   the uk has been doing that on its own since a while . 
  and it 's disgusting . 
   have you ever heard of this kind of arrests outside the uk ? 
  http://www.dw.com/en/online-anti-refugee-posts-lead-to-offline-visits-by-dutch-police/a-19005888 it 's going to happen . 
  that 's why britain needs to get out now , and then start to toss out its orwellian politicians ; rather than stay in a transnational , centralized framework that will only become more of a behemoth of censorship and control . 
  [ two differences !, 
  ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/brandenburg_test ) i 'm being cheeky , but it 's shocking seeing how many people are just * totally fine * with government having that level of power to shut people up . 
  this is part of why a uk vote to leave the eu and it 's own [ nastiness ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/31/facebook-youtube-twitter-microsoft-eu-hate-speech-code ) in censoring public speech by harnessing the power of complicit media corporations is ultimately only the * first * step of several . 
  looking over fellow western polities ' standards of `` free speech '' is absolutely nightmarish - - was n't this the continent of the enlightenment ? 
  but this will probably work out alright . 
  not only do european nations ( especially northern european ones with pretty homogeneous monocultural societies with little class difference , and thus little policy resentment on grounds of ` us ' vs ` them ) take to public means of production/utility / `` socialism '' in moderation , they generally ** also ** have very robust cultural notions of eschewing corruption/law and order/democratic representation . 
  latin america 's travails , or venezuela 's , do n't just come from the inefficiencies and sustainability issues of badly implemented socialism ( though that 's a huge part of it ) - - massive , massive corruption in almost every facet of the political culture and routine breakdowns in law and order , and a deep cynicism , instead of trust , with institutions of power , make them pretty incapable . 
  russia has some of this , india has some of this - - and european nations , for all their ills , generally * do n't * . 
  furthermore , ireland is small , and developed , and small developed nations can be nimble in terms of which economic roles are pursued , and what goodies they can have without problems of scale . 
   as we have an under-representation of people from ethnic minority backgrounds in script editing roles at the bbc it 's the right thing to do . 
  yeah , so , i 'm an `` ethnic minority '' in my own country , and the problem with all of these approaches - whether it 's jobs , schooling , political appointments , etc. 
  is that those of us `` minorities '' ( we do n't get to be individuals - that 's for white people ) who are simply * good at what we do * then get to carry around a stigma forever when it comes to our successes . 
  everyone gets to wonder whether we 're competent , or the result of a handout . 
  furthermore , i have been around ` diversity ' hires - people who were n't good , but were brought into the fold because it served an extraneous requirement . 
  they were specifically chosen because of the color of their skin , because it soothed some anxiety of a white person . 
  you know what it 's like almost getting disfigured because someone does n't know how a separatory funnel works and it 's filled with hf ? 
  * not great * let everyone apply for the trainee roles , and if you 're discouraged institutionally about there being too few `` minorities '' , maybe ask yourself why matters that people are `` underrepresented '' on the basis of skin deep attributes so much that you have to start telling other people with the wrong appearance that they simply are n't suitable . 
  diversity policies , from a `` minority '' perspective , always feel like well to do white people that want a menagerie of insecurity solving skin tones around them .

   the industrial and technological revolution has made most of these tasks physically easy in comparison to the past . 
  and it 's not over yet . 
  in the next years at least one third of all jobs are going to vanish just because we will automate transport and logistics . 
  where is this specialization needed , that you are speaking of ? 
  the only one that matters for children : the division of time spent , the hours in a day that go towards raising children , vs working to provide material receipt for those children . 
  that , fundamentally , is why two parent homes ( the data on life outcomes shows this is true for gay parents as well ) usually do better for kids than single parent homes . 
   and by the way , what if a woman does n't want to have children ? 
  what should we do with her in your perfect world ? 
  maybe fine her , or rape and impregnate her against her will , ** no because that 's fucking psychotic ** all i was pointing out was that it 's too much for anyone to expect the youth to have kids given how much the economy around being able to have/wanting to have a family has changed . 
    i think arguments like the ones you brought are just reactionary . 
  no , i think the person who is so insecure they launch into `` omg , so we should rape women , right ? 
  huh ? 
  huh ? 
  that 's what you 're saying ?!, 
  ! 11 '' is the reactionary . 
  jesus , dude , calm the fuck down . 
  the basic problem is that we have two huge negative pressures on native population * stability * - - forget growth - - i mean just not having the native population crater and die ( which is bad news for welfare programs as well as simple economic power , on top of social cohesion , given that governments around the world are importing foreign people to shore up numbers ) : 1 ) the sexual revolution is complete . 
  sex , love , marriage , and reproduction are entirely separate things now . 
  they take place somewhere between the ages of 15 and 35 for the vast majority of the world 's westerners , and have now for * two * generations , been further and further separated from one another - in terms of when , with whom , with what money , and assuming what kind of permanence . 
  all of it is totally different in the modern age compared to almost every circumstance that has come before . 
  the issue is not ( and this ad is missing the point ) a lack of sex . 
  compared to what sexual norms were in 1916 , or 1926 , or 1936 , or 1946 , or 1956 , or 1966 , or 1976 ( with greater and greater similarity as you go each decade step forward to what we have now ) , sex is far less linked to the institution of marriage , and * having children * within the context of marriage is * far * less often the object of sex for * most * people . 
  commitment too , is totally different . 
  the idea of having four or five sex partners by 24 ( you might be batting higher or lower than i am , i dunno ) is n't the only innovation the sexual revolution brought ; * marriage itself * has totally changed , because alongside sexual changes , we saw workplace changes . 
  women are not expected to be at home with the kids ( the kids people do n't have ) , but rather , via their economic independence , be working alongside men and stay ` independent ' in between their time as children at home , and wives in a new home . 
  that period has gotten longer and longer and longer , as educational demands require it to earn any kind of wage .
