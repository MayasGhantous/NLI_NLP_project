  furthermore , the culture has changed : marriage/having kids is the * death of youth * for pretty much all westerners . 
  https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/marriage/data/acs/elliottetalpaa2012figs.pdf the average age of marriage for women in the us from 1890 ( and much before it ) to about 1940 was basically only several months above or below ** 23 ** . 
  it 's now nearly 27 , and most people retain * some * kind of value for having kids within the context of marriage , and female fertility has remained the same as well ; people just wo n't have that many more children . 
  2 ) doubling the labor pool halved the wages part of it , as i said before , is linked to changes in the sexual culture as it relates to female independence from parents and the putative husband because she 's working , with further educational demands basically lengthening the period non-commitment , * but * : for all genders - - - wages are ** stagnant ** . 
  we turned the wife into a series of girlfriends , we turned the mother into another worker . 
  that 's all well and good , but * women are the bottleneck on reproduction * . 
  the stereotype that exists in nearly all cultures is `` man goes to work , woman raises the kid '' , because that specialization of labor , and division of time , * worked * . 
  when both are working , for * less money * ( employers have twice as many workers to do the work ; they do n't need to pay * more * or something ) , the opportunity cost of having children makes it basically impossible in the short and long term - - - it 's lost wages to have children !, 
  __________________ this ad , and so many like it , are missing the point completely . 
  ** there is no duty ** by the young , to have children , and be consumers , and go into more and more debt , or even marry at this point , until we have some kind of true reckoning with the older generations on student debt , on housing prices , on wages , and on taxes for benefits . 
  there is no point to having children just to save the pensions of people who already robbed the future of their own youth . 
   we have way way way more unemployed people now compared to 100 years ago . 
  by the standarts of 1900 we have around a 40 % unemployed rate . 
  can you source that ? 
  not attacking you , i 'm genuinely curious as to how it was measured . 
   i think it is extremely unfortunate that people are being pushed into a position where they feel the need to prostitute themselves to pay off their student debts i do n't like how sex negative the author of this article seems to be . 
  then you do n't think it 's that unfortunate . 
  youth who are students are hardly past being someone 's kid , encouraged to do well in school in order to have a better prospect in life for themselves . 
  if you ca n't see the huge disconnect between pursuing higher education and whoring oneself out for money - - - out of necessity , not because one genuinely enjoys sex regardless of a relationship and just wants to be paid - - - then you 're basically just too oversensitive . 
  prostitution is * base * . 
  for the vast majority of adults , sex is something that implies care and love for another person , and for the vast majority of parents , their children ( who are their offspring from sex ) are the most important things in the world - - - thus their education , their ability to move forward in labor markets , is the second most important thing in the world . 
  for their children - - - and yes , it 's reasonable to view university students as ` children ' in society , as most of them are still dependent on their parents ( clearly not financially independent and comfortable ) - - - to have to resort to prostitution in order to afford education is a complete black mark on the incentive structure of a society , regardless of how a loan structure works . 
  this is n't about being sex negative . 
  sex is wonderful . 
  people having to resort to prostitution to get college degrees because our financing of higher education as the means of movement * from * financial desperation , is shameful . 
   the dalai lama is a refugee himself . 
  he is , and that in addition to his status should maybe make us listen to him a bit harder when he unambiguously criticizes how our polities and mainstream media are talking about refugees . 
  they do , but they pay like , 10 bucks a minute for the stream , so ... 
  https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/belgium.html https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/france.html bruh , just google that shit, 
  dollar bennies are better than peso bennies, 
   history has shown that people are stupid . 
  ^ know-it-all smart people lose all the time , and they never figure out why they keep getting humiliated as they never cultivate any humility . 
  have fun watching the eu breakup piece by piece : ), 
   we are too reliant on russian gas . 
  time to start pursuing concrete measures that will make you * less * reliant , while stepping up sanctions in tandem . 
  otherwise , you 're basically permanently ensuring there 's no real economic tool germany , and the eu , has to impose a requirement for good behavior on russia - - leaving only capitulation to what putin wants , or outright warfare . 
   the tools and funding for further exploration are already affected by the current regime of sanctions . 
  again - - sounds like germany will either make the investments that allow it ( and by extension ) , and the eu the ability to have their policy as europeans be off russia 's petrol-leash , or it will choose to be a dependent . 
   ` because it is ~ ~ france ~ ~ the other half of the franco-german union that is eu power ', 
  once a government decides it will no longer allow representation of a people within policy making , but opts to shoot them , yeah - - those peoples ' revolutionary cause is just . 
  that 's * not * what happened in crimea . 
  when the people of ukraine had the euromaidan protests , * yanukovich * started killing ukrainians like the good russian puppet he is . 
  the he was ousted . 
  then putin 's small-dicked paranoia led him to support a bunch of murderous separatists with arms and russian regular troops , shooting down civilian jetliners and bombing civilians . 
  and they 're still going !, 
  totally , totally different from the american revolution . 
   sorry , my english is lacking nah bro , do n't worry - - the natural way for a native speaker to parse :  ... the leftists and `` liberals '' are not trying to `` normalise '' relations with russia anymore since they invaded ukraine . 
  is in fact to assume the antecedent of ` they ' is `` russia '' and not ` the leftists and `` liberals '' ' . 
  it 's just possible to interpret it both ways , because ` collective nouns ' ( like russia here ) as antecedents can take both singular and plural pronouns ( like ` liberals ' and ` leftists ' would require ) and we tend to use a combination of proximity and emphasis in voice to clarify which is linked with which . 
  yes , and the british made a completely legal attempt to try and retain their colonies ( despite their abusive killing of british subjects in boston ) by deploying troops . 
  the colonists ended up shooting at troops of their legal government , rejecting the royal sovereignty of the british crown , and created a new nation . 
  that is totally different from the russian federation , fearing that a sovereign state of ukraine would join the european union , deciding to back separatists aided by russian regular troops to annex territory that does n't belong to them . 
  if the region of crimea had instead , petitioned for autonomy , and had a corroborated set of grievances with kiev 's government - - and had pursued redress as ukrainian citizens only to be killed by ukrainian security forces - - - then i would have a ** totally ** different opinion about a crimean independence movement , even one which sought the aid of the russian federation and planned to eventually accede to being part of russia , much like texas . 
   do you realise that dnr and lnr have significant armies of their own ? 
  from russia . 
   they have tens thousands of men , hundreds of tanks , artillery , mlrs . 
  * literally from russia *  you said bunch of ukrainians were killed . 
  ok , that 's unfortunate . 
  and it was enabled by the russian federation . 
   but do you realise that dnr and lnr soldiers are being killed daily in the very same way * because they 're a violent separatist movement illegally killing ukrainians on ukrainian territory . 
  *  it 's a war , it 's mutual killing . 
  not mutual legality . 
  ukraine has every right to ** all ** of its own territory . 
  http://www.stripes.com/news/europe/poll-willingness-to-defend-allies-from-attack-low-in-some-nato-states-1.351606  more than half the public in germany , italy and france does n't support using military force in response to a russian attack on a nato member , according to a survey that reveals the fragility of the alliance 's bedrock principle that an attack on one is an attack on all . 
   the survey , conducted by the pew research center , showed that citizens in nato countries are unified in viewing russia as the culprit in the conflict in ukraine , and consider moscow a threat to neighboring states . 
  however , there are sharp divisions when it comes to countering russia should moscow ever attempt an attack on a member of the 28-nation alliance . 
  dude , half of these assholes do n't even want to honor their obligations to nato , which is explicitly a defensive military pact . 
  the eu has no coherent migrant policy , or equitable monetary framework - - - do n't count on it to magically have its shit together as a martial entity . 
  it 's a combination of naivete and mixed messages . 
  it 's totally possible to have a job in the tech industry in berlin , and get by ( perhaps ` eke out ' a life more than get by ) day to day , without speaking german , and just speaking english - - - english is the lingua franca of computer science jobs , and berlin is a global , cosmopolitan city . 
  that 's really not true , otherwise though , but sometimes people will hear from their friend who worked at soundcloud ( or whatever ) that this is how it is and assume what applies in one case is basically how it works everywhere else . 
  our exposure to mundane realities outside of the us when it comes to things like different languages is muted in mass media , as opposed to the more ` exciting ' news that comes out of europe . 
   most americans contact our company thinking we 're illegal and we 'll be cheaper than other american housemaids . 
  generally , this is * also * a good bet , even if there 's some ugly undertones . 
  what 's `` legal '' basically comes down to what comports with the law . 
  legal h1b visas are adored by tech companies for highly skilled labor in the us , because a legally working bangladeshi database administrator , even if he 's no better than an american tech worker , ** will ** basically work for less than the american , if it means he gets a chance to live and work in the us , possibly apply for citizenship , and earn wages in us dollars and have a us workhistory . 
  fundamentally , the more people there are to do some kind of labor , the lower wages will be - - - mass illegal immigration is just * especially * pernicious in the us because illegal immigrants are just * especially * more exploitable . 
  i actually have n't played that game , so i have no idea . 
  [ remarks by secretary gates at the security and defense agenda , brussels , belgium , 2011 ] ( http://archive.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4839 )  turning to the nato operation over libya , it has become painfully clear that similar shortcomings -- in capability and will -- have the potential to jeopardize the alliance 's ability to conduct an integrated , effective and sustained air-sea campaign . 
  consider that operation unified protector is :  * a mission with widespread political support ;  * a mission that does not involve ground troops under fire ;  * and indeed , is a mission in europe 's neighborhood deemed to be in europe 's vital interest . 
   to be sure , at the outset , the nato libya mission did meet its initial military objectives -- grounding qaddafi 's air force and degrading his ability to wage offensive war against his own citizens . 
  and while the operation has exposed some shortcomings caused by underfunding , it has also shown the potential of nato , with an operation where europeans are taking the lead with american support . 
   however , while every alliance member voted for libya mission , less than half have participated at all , and fewer than a third have been willing to participate in the strike mission . 
  frankly , many of those allies sitting on the sidelines do so not because they do not want to participate , but simply because they ca n't . 
   * the military capabilities simply are n't there . 
  *  in particular , intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance assets are lacking that would allow more allies to be involved and make an impact . 
  the most advanced fighter aircraft are little use if allies do not have the means to identify , process , and strike targets as part of an integrated campaign . 
  to run the air campaign , the nato air operations center in italy required a major augmentation of targeting specialists , mainly from the u.s. , to do the job -- a `` just in time '' infusion of personnel that may not always be available in future contingencies . 
   we have the spectacle of an air operations center designed to handle more than 300 sorties a day struggling to launch about 150 . 
  furthermore , the mightiest military alliance in history is only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly armed regime in a sparsely populated country -- yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions , requiring the u.s. , once more , to make up the difference . 
   in the past , i 've worried openly about nato turning into a two-tiered alliance : between members who specialize in `` soft ' humanitarian , development , peacekeeping , and talking tasks , and those conducting the `` hard '' combat missions . 
  between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments , and those who enjoy the benefits of nato membership -- be they security guarantees or headquarters billets -- but do n't want to share the risks and the costs . 
  this is no longer a hypothetical worry . 
  we are there today . 
  and it is unacceptable . 
  gates goes on to note that certain nations have truly `` punched above their weight '' - pointing out that norway and denmark , though only providing about 12 % of strike aircraft for the libya operation ended up hitting about * 33 % * of targets , and * also * goes on to note that he is so pessimistic about the circumstances of funding and burden sharing in the alliance changing in the future , that the relevant conversation is mostly about mission priority and how scarce resources will be used . 
  nato either has to be dissolved and the us has to have * ad hoc * defense relationships with different groups of nations on case by case mutual obligations , or it has to be reconstituted to fulfill true international objectives for the following reason he gives in his speech :  the blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the u.s. congress -- and in the american body politic writ large -- to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense . 
  nations apparently willing and eager for american taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in european defense budgets . 
   indeed , if current trends in the decline of european defense capabilities are not halted and reversed , * future u.s. political leaders -- those for whom the cold war was not the formative experience that it was for me -- may not consider the return on america 's investment in nato worth the cost .
