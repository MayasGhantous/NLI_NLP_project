  is n't it amazing how math works ? 
  i 'm trying to comprehend your rhetoric , but it 's irrational , and makes no mathematical sense ...  it was a 2.19 km violation by two aircraft lasting 17 seconds from both aircraft flying at 800kmh + uhm ... traveling at 800km + , you 'd be traveling 2.19 km ** far ** less time than 17 seconds ... 
  your math is incorrect , and sounds 100 % made up . 
  it was a 2.19 km , for 17 seconds ( not sure how you justify magically dividing your made up 8 seconds in half , but okay ) , or just over 450kmph ... aka , just above stall speed for a su-24 . 
  they were warned for 5 minutes before entering turkish airspace . 
  1 aircraft turned around , the other did not . 
  the second 1 of the su-24s crossed into turkish airspace , an f-16 launched an aim-9 missile at it . 
  aim-9 's max speed , is mach 2.7 , or 3333kmph . 
  obviously it does n't travel at that from the second it 's launched , but still , we 'll say it does . 
  that means it would take a minute , for it to travel to its target from even just 35km away . 
  russia said it was hit 1km from the syrian turkish border , which adds roughly 10-15 seconds from the time it crossed into turkish airspace ( bringing the total time to 27-32 seconds ) . 
  that would be in line with the exact middle of the aim-9 's range , and essentially the ** exact ** place you 'd want to be for launching one . 
  simple fucking math , dicates that turkey was telling the truth , and launched a missile the second the aircraft entered their airspace . 
  by the time it hit , roughly 30 seconds had traveled , and the su-24 had just reentered syrian airspace . 
  simple math , simple math . 
  is this the new russian story of what happened since people stopped believing the hand drawn map they tried to peddle as a radar tracker ? 
  it 's almost just as pathetic tbh ... 
   what is a threat of airspace ? 
  violating a sovereign nation 's airspace , while failing to respond on icao frequencies that no aircraft is supposed to go up without listening to , while flying at near stall speeds ( indicative of a bombing run ) , via a [ particular aircraft that 's infamous for shoddy navigation ] ( http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/these-russian-attack-jets-use-walmart-grade-gps-systems-1703048443 ) ... would generally be considered pretty god damn threatening . 
  * not responding/monitoring to 121.5 mhz generally points to something nefarious/illegal * near stall speeds means you 're either landing , taking off , or about to drop ordnance * shitty navigation systems means they might not realize they 're not over their intended target combine that , with it entering your sovereign airspace , and yeah , it 's threatening ... 
  i mean , technically they 're right , there 's no nato airspace , but rather national airspace of multiple countries , and nato members assist in patrolling the national airspace of their allies . 
  with that said though , threats against a nato member 's airspace is a threat towards a nato member , which is regarded as a threat towards each and every nato member . 
  russia ca n't try to threaten turkey for simply defending its territorial airspace , and they wonder why nato 's getting involved and backing a nato member ... 
  while the violation was against turkey 's sovereignty , the threat was felt by every nato member thanks to article 5 of the nato doctrine . 
  for all of europe there 's : * 25 asw ( anti-submarine warfare ) capable aircraft * 6 awacs ( airborne warning and control system ) capable aircraft , but 3 are for france 's carrier * 22 refueler aircraft ( only 5 are dedicated refuelers though , the rest are part of the strategic transport fleet ) * 30 strategic ( capable of traveling outside of europe ) transport aircraft ( but half are also part of the refueling fleet ) * 23 underway replenishment ships ( half are under 5000 tons ) i 'm sorry , but europe 's military logistics capabilities , are virtually non existent . 
  that list , is enough to operate a sizable european force within western europe , but would struggle with even prolonged conflict in eastern europe . 
  it 's enough to keep maybe a quarter of the ships at sea . 
  europe has a fuck ton of tanks , frigates , destroyers , submarines , and fighter jets ... but it 's problem is it has essentially no way to get any of them anywhere . 
  every country has invested in the fighting part of the military , with virtually nothing spent on the logistics that gets that fighting force where it needs to go . 
  point in case would be france 's operation serval , where the usaf had to fly france 's troops to mali , and had to refuel france 's transports in flight , because their entire refueling fleet doubles as their transport fleet and they were all being used to transport ... and the uk should be fucking ** ashamed ** of itself , for being a god damn island nation , with literally no way to detect and track submarines off its waters . 
  what could be a greater threat to an island than submarines ?!, 
  europe is overall dependent on the us for virtually any military operation that 's south of italy , west of spain , and east of germany . 
  within that , yeah , it 's a terrifying military ... outside of that though ... what are they going to do , send angry texts at their enemy ? 
  look at libya . 
  guess who provided virtually 100 % of flight comms ? 
  guess who had to sell munitions to other nations when they ran out ? 
  guess who had to give fuel away to other nations when they ran out ? 
  guess who had to fix other nations ' aircraft when they broke down because they did n't have the technicians or spare parts to do so ? 
  us to all of the above . 
  both were already attempted actually ... russia refused to join the eu , and russia said `` great nations create coalitions , they do not join them . 
  russia is a great nation '' when bill clinton mentioned possibly having russia join nato . 
  they do n't want to be part of either , because they would n't be the party in charge of them ... that 's why russia created their eeu . 
  an economic union they would be the party in charge of . 
  [ are we considering things like libya us proxy wars , even though it was france and the uk who were foaming at the mouth and demanding nato action against ghaddafi ? 
  or have we already forgotten that ? 
  ] ( http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2060412,00.html ) [ or are we considering things like syria us proxy wars , even though it was france who was foaming at the mouth demanding assad be removed , even by military action if needed ? 
  or have we already forgotten that ? 
  ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2011/world/europe/08/31/france.syria.sarkozy/ ) not really us proxy wars , but rather us going `` well , if we 're doing this , better go all in '' us ' wars over the past 15 years , have been iraq and afghanistan . 
  libya and syria were france and the uk , it 's just that the us ended up doing more in it than them . 
  italy would do more than germany . 
  italy has the 3rd most powerful military in europe ... 
  2 most powerful militaries in europe ? 
  uk and france , easily . 
  * uk could n't even hunt a submarine off their coastline , because they have no aircraft that can do so . 
  us had to send a p-8 from sigonella italy , up to the uk , to help hunt down a russian sub detected in the waters off london ... * france , could n't get troops and supplies to mali for a counter-insurgency , the lightest combat operation type there is , without ** extensive ** usaf help , with flying troops and equipment there , as well as refueling the aircraft on the way , because france 's refueling capabilities are essentially non existent ... 
  so you have 1 of the most power european militaries could n't even hunt a submarine off the coast of it 's capital , and the other could n't get 1500 miles way for a coin operation . 
  what 's that say about the state of european militaries as a whole ? 
  europe has a bad fucking habit on spending money on the flashy parts of a military ; tanks , submarines , jets ... but then completely skip the logistics part of it . 
  god forbid they had to fight in even poland , because they 'd have no fucking way to get their shit there without either : a. having the us fly them there b. transport it all via railroads , opening them up to devastating airstrikes c. spend months upon months slowly trickling in forces and supplies , hoping that the enemy does n't really try to push the front at all, 
  you also spend more as a percentage of gdp , than most of europe does . 
  germany for example , is currently below 1 % , while poland just broke 2 % iirc . 
   however , maybe russia will try to blockade turkey and turkey closes its strait ? 
  both would be acts of war ... russia blockading a nato state is a good way to get nato to declare war on you . 
  turkey wo n't close the straight , because doing so means they 're on their own , as they would be the aggressor ... 
  because it 's territorial airspace , not adiz . 
  i wish reddit could fucking comprehend that . 
  you intercept and escort if they 're in your adiz . 
  you shoot down if they enter your territorial airspace . 
  * territorial airspace , is the airspace above your land , and up to 12nmi ( 22.2 km ) over international waterways ( obviously if you and another country are closer than 24nmi over a sea , like greece/turkey over the aegean sea , it 's split 50/50 ) . 
  * adiz ( air defense identification zone ) , is airspace outside of your territorial airspace , over international waters , that you still monitor for your own strategic interests . 
  you have no authority in your adiz , as it 's still international airspace , but you can operate within it , monitor aircraft within it , and intercept aircraft within it , before they actually enter your territorial airspace . 
  unlike russia 's provocations in the baltics and the us ' west coast , there 's no adiz between turkey and syria , as it 's a land border . 
  where the 1 's territorial airspace ends , the other 's begins . 
  that 's why there 's no adiz between the us and mexico around texas for example , because where 1 's territorial airspace ends , the other 's begins . 
  if there 's a non allied aircraft in your adiz ? 
  yes , you intercept and escort away , and that 's all you can do , because it 's technically still international airspace . 
  if a non allied aircraft enters your territorial airspace ? 
  you shoot them fucking down , no questions asked . 
  us northcom 's commander ( 4 star general in charge of all us personnel and operations in north america ) , has even stated that the us will absolutely not allow ** any ** territorial airspace violations , and that any such violations , will result in an immediate missile bearing in on the violator . 
  if russia has a problem with that , maybe they should n't use fucking ** garmins ** for their navigation system . 
  i 'm not sure why it 's turkey 's fault russia 's navigation systems are so fucking shitty , they ca n't tell where they actually are ... because of that , how can you expect that su-24 to know that it 's actually over a turkish village , and not a syrian village ? 
  how does it know it 's not 1km off it 's target when it drops its ordnance ? 
  it does n't , and that 's why turkey is completely justified in shooting down any fighter that violates its territorial airspace . 
  also , intercepting does n't do shit , if the fighters are n't listening to icao frequencies no aircraft is allowed to take off without listening to . 
  not responding on 121.5 mhz is a good way to get your ass shot down in the first place , because it 's a direct violation of international law , and is usually synonymous with illicit activities . 
  but , i 'm just a former military flight communications watch officer , so what do i know ? 
  edit : here 's a su-24 's cockpit , with a garmin handheld for navigation ... [ article ] ( http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/these-russian-attack-jets-use-walmart-grade-gps-systems-1703048443 ) , and here is the icao standards from icao 's website ... [ link ] ( http://www.icao.int/apac/meetings/2015%20srwg2/sp03_icao%20emergency%20frequency%20-%20rev.pdf ) edit2 : thanks / u/androlo for the gold :d, 
  did n't know they had it on the site , thanks !, 
  fair enough , i was just going off the 2012 figures , because some nations have n't released anything newer so it did n't seem right to do an accounting of 2015 without every figure available, 
  not according to german voters sadly . 
  over 50 % said germany should not intervene if russia invaded the baltics , who are nato states . 
  merkle has said she would , but apparently the voters do not agree http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/?fa=60389, 
  meh , everyone is way off nato targets anymore , with the exception of the us , france , greece ( because there 's no economy anyways ) , turkey , uk , and estonia . 
  outside of them , everyone falls outside of nato targets . 
  only exempt nation is iceland , which has no standing army and is exempt from funding one . 
  typhoons cost way more than that ... flyaway in 2015 was 90.000.000 $ , if you were the uk/germany/italy / spain . 
  for anyone else , they 're around 200.000.000 $ a piece operating and maintenance costs are around 20.000 $ an hour ( as the average over the entire airframe 's lifespan ) , with roughly a 20000 hour lifespan , or a * total * operating/maintenance cost of 400.000.000 $ per jet, 
  save your breath . 
  they said  becoming a cop = becoming a gangster  it 's stupid to pretend that the police officer is n't partly responsible at this point , you 're basically just playing chess with a pigeon, 
  it 's not backtracking at all ... * it was decided that in the event of our airspace being violated , all necessarily measures would be taken , all relevant orders to the armed forces were given by me , personally aka : i ordered our military , in the event of any airspace violations , to take x , y , and z steps to remove the foreign aircraft from turkish airspace * i did not give the order to shoot down that plane , '' davutoglu told ntv , claiming it would not have been possible to give the order as the russian plane allegedly spent 17 seconds in turkish airspace .
