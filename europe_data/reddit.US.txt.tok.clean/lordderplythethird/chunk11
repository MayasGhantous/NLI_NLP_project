  `` the prime minister issues instructions to enact threat response guidelines . 
  these guidelines are not new and they are applied without my orders aka : i did n't tell that particular pilot to shoot down the aircraft . 
  it would be impossible for me to do so in such a short period of time . 
  i gave our military orders in how to handle these situations , but i did not personally direct them during this situation he 's literally saying the same things , just in different wording . 
  there 's no backtracking , there 's rt simply using smoke and mirrors to convey what they want you to see out of his speeches . 
  his speeches essentially state * i have previously given the turkish military orders on how to deal with territorial airspace violations , and those orders are the guidelines now for these sorts of events . 
  i did not personally direct this operation though , as it was too brief for that to of been a possibility i mean , it 's idiotic to think a politician is on call for literally every single flight operation taking place along a border like the turkish syrian border . 
  that 'd be like expecting park geun-hye ( south korean president ) , to be on call for literally every time a dprk fighter , ship , etc crosses into south korean territory . 
  just not gon na happen . 
  they have too much shit going on , to serve regularly as a general as well, 
  i looked it up , and you 're not lying ... typically a type 45 is deployed there , along with a patrol boat , 1200 troops , and 4 typhoons . 
  does n't sound like much , but almost none of the argentinian navy ships are seaworthy and are permanently docked , and their only fighters are a handful of modernized a-4s ( from the 1950s ) ... yikes . 
  what about operation serval , where france could n't get supplies to mali for a coin operation , without extensive us logistics support , because their transportation and refueling capabilities are virtually non existent ? 
  it took most of all the heavy transports in europe to get france to mali and supplied ... that was a coin operation ... how fucked would they be fighting a near peer in even poland ? 
  a near peer in the pacific ? 
  how effective is that 27 ship blue water navy going to be with just * 3 * replenishment ships against another naval power ? 
  i 'm sorry , but european militaries overall , are woefully inept at logistics , and routinely ** heavily ** rely on the us msc , and usaf amc to get them anywhere . 
  royal navy is really the only one that 's not virtually 100 % dependent on the us for support , thanks to their actual fleet of unrep ships . 
  french could n't even get to mali for a counter insurgency , arguably the lightest combat mission there is , without ** extensive ** foreign logistics support . 
  european militaries are focused on the `` glamorous '' parts of war , but are completely inept at logistics . 
  europe as a whole , would n't even be able to handle afghanistan on their own . 
  they simply ca n't get the troops and supplies needed there . 
  us got virtually all the supplies there for them . 
  us even provides the defense for some of them . 
  like how the uk currently ca n't track subs right off their coast . 
  they have to rely on a us squadron rotating out aircraft to protect them . 
  look back a few months ago , where a russian sub was off their coast . 
  the squadron was in the middle of rotating out , so uk had literally nothing . 
  they had to beg france to send something to look for it for them . 
  uhm ... 
  i 'm just an ignorant burger , but is n't that the whole point of the eu battle groups that already exist ? 
  you gon na create * another * political show of force that has no real hard power ? 
  even if it did n't , it 's mintpressnews . 
  they make up whatever they want . 
  they ran an article about how in their interview with the chief un weapons inspector , he admitted that the syrian rebels , equipped by saudi arabia , were responsible for the chemical weapons attack . 
  when asked about it , he said he had never even heard of mintpressnews before he saw that article . 
  they 're scummy `` media '' who make up whatever they think is going to bring in views , and run off the `` we 're telling you what the government does n't want you to know '' moniker, 
  how am i apologising for them , for calling bullshit out for what it is , bullshit ? 
  i 'm sorry , but if you want to be hateful towards turkey , there 's dozens of reasons , without resorting to ignorantly making up reasons in your own little fantasy . 
  but i guess because i 'm choosing to not be ignorant , i must not be a pontic greek , and my last name totally is n't petagulous , about as fucking greek as you can get . 
  do n't spew bullshit next time , and attempt to slander someone because they made you look like a fool . 
  the pkk openly kill their fellow kurds if they do n't protect them . 
  pkk is to turkey like hamas is to israel . 
  they 're a vile institution `` fighting against repression '' that no longer exists , and openly attack their own people if they feel they 're not loyal enough . 
  pkk forces have killed more kurds in turkey during the pkk-turkish conflict , than the turkish military has ... you a village guard ? 
  you 're going to be killed . 
  you 're a teacher/politician speaking for peace ? 
  you 're going to be killed . 
  pkk are disgusting . 
  and i say this as a pontic greek with no fucking love for turkey . 
  the amount of sheer fucking down right ignorance regarding the pkk and what it does and stands for on reddit , is fucking astounding . 
  it 's essentially the same god damn thing as hamas , yet people like yourself truly believe they actually stand for some legitimate purpose , instead of being fanatical terrorists who do n't care about any thing or any one but themselves . 
  pkk claims kurds have been oppressed by erdogan ? 
  yeah , that 's why the akp , erdogan 's party , has been historically the party of the kurds . 
  that 's why , outside of this past election , the kurds in turkey overwhelmingly vote for the akp . 
  the pkk openly kill their fellow kurds if they do n't protect them . 
  pkk is to turkey like hamas is to israel .

  f-35 orders include spare parts , training for mechanics/pilots , depo level repair contracts , and things like that . 
  yeah , local mechanics are going to do a lot of the repairs , but some of it 's gon na have to go to italy for depo level repairs , and that 's done via lockheed , not italy itself , so the price for that service is included in the order cost . 
  not when turkey 's link-16 radar tracks clearly show it violating turkish airspace , and russia 's response was handdrawing a map to prove it did n't violate the airspace . 
  [ this is actual radar data tracked and mapped via link-16 , which most every nato country uses ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/06ee/production/_86847710_4244121f-6f25-419b-a113-d94603724eeb.jpg ) [ this is someone hand drawing a flight path , and expecting it to be taken legitimately ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/russian_map_of_su-24_shootdown_by_turkey.png ), 
  moscowtimes is n't bad most of the time , but any time they post an article that even slightly criticizes russia , they get showered in threats and accusations of working with the cia ... 
  i actually enjoyed blood sausage when i tried it ... it was different and weird , but good, 
  woman in the red dress likely is n't a diplomat , but rather some kind of clerical/secretary role . 
  almost no one assigned to an embassy is an actual ambassador/diplomat . 
  you have a large number of it personnel , from the imo ( information management officer ) , to the isso ( informations systems security officer ) , and dozens in between . 
  you have small groups assigned to represent a large number of things such as : * faa ( federal aviation administration ) * usda ( us department of agriculture ) * irs ( internal revenue services ) * ust ( us treasury ) * dod ( department of defense ) and dozens of other groups . 
  they 're not diplomats in any kind . 
  they 're just there for the * actual * diplomats to be able to refer to during diplomatic talks . 
  they likely never meet any foreign diplomat or politician or official . 
  they just brief their own before and after diplomatic talks , regarding things they can offer and use to sweeten foreign deals . 
  i actually help maintain the us state department 's computer networks , and i often times have to work with personnel at the embassy/consulate to fix an issue . 
  for example , a bit ago , i worked on something with astana ( capital of kazakhstan ) . 
  i worked with the imo , isso , ipo , iso , and 5 other people . 
  that 's just * part * of their it department , and not a single one , were a diplomat in any form . 
  it takes ** a lot ** to run an embassy , people have no idea . 
  not exactly true . 
  us navy does n't allow regular access to alcohol aboard ships , because you 're expected to be able to perform emergency roles at any given time ... 
  however , they * do * have what we refer to as steel beach picnics and beer days , where they give us beer aboard the ship . 
  generally it 's a `` we 're sorry you guys have been deployed with no shore visits in 45 days , so here 's some beer to keep morale up '' . 
  but outside of that , yeah . 
  no alcohol aboard ships . 
  not really out of the ordinary . 
  there 's usually french personnel on us carriers . 
  cross training and things such as that usually dictate it honestly . 
  woah ... multirole does n't have anything to do with carriers ... multirole just means they 're capable of doing multiple combat roles , like air superiority , sead , cas , interdiction , bombing , etc. 
  f-16s ca n't operate off carriers , yet they 're considered multiroles . 
  eurofighters currently , are highly limited in the roles they can be used for .
