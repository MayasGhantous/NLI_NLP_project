  they 're working on adding in more weapon capabilities , but for now they 're mostly interceptors . 
  after all the weapon coding and testing is done , they 're be more capable multiroles though, 
  nope it was gon na be too expensive and maintenance intensive to make it retract , so they just left it up permanently, 
  lm actually joined the f-35 program late , and heavily reused tech and plans from the f-22 to come up with the x-35 . 
  iirc , it went something like how it did with nato . 
  nato skirted with the idea of inviting russia , and how it would work . 
  russia stated great nations do n't join unions , they create them , and russia is a great nation , thus ending the discussion . 
  iirc , it went the same way with the eu . 
  they skirted with the idea of inviting russia , who did n't like that they would n't be the controlling figure of the eu , and said no , and created the eeu instead . 
  no , they did n't . 
  they , and virtually every other group within the southern front , signed an agreement in april condemning al nusra and declaring them enemies of the revolution ... 
  you comprehend there 's multiple different groups with `` al-sham '' in the name ... correct ? 
  this is the fucking problem with reddit , i swear ... you see `` al-sham '' and think of ghuraba al-sham , who beheads people and are radicals allied with al-nusra . 
  sword of al-sham brigades has literally fuck all to do with them . 
  al-sham simply means `` damascus '' , as it comes from bilad al-sham , which simply means `` syria '' . 
  but because you choose to be ignorant , you think because they have `` al-sham '' in they 're name , they 're the same and must be radicals, 
  southern front are labeled terrorists by russia and actively bombed by russia as well . 
  southern front actively fights isis , and have declared al-nusra enemies of the rebellion and attack them as well . 
  there 's virtually no radical element in southern syria , with the exception of hezbollah ( who 's allied with assad and russia ) , yet russia 's been bombing the ever living piss out of them . 
  just 1 example too . 
  there 's multiple forces that are in the same boat as southern front . 
  you 're an anti-assad force ? 
  you 're radical islamic terrorists in the eyes of russia . 
  [ russia 's going after assad ? 
  huh ... til ... ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/revealed-the-oil-middleman-between-the-syrian-regime-and-isis-2015-3 ), 
  yeah , because first army , first corps , quneitra military council , amoud houran brigade , sword of al-sham brigades , martyrs of islam brigade are * totally * radical groups ... who cares they 're all active in the fight against isis , declared al-nusra enemies of the rebellion , and have openly fought against them . 
  but i guess because they have `` islam '' and `` al-sham '' and arabic sounding names , they totally must be radical islamics . 
  / s the amount of ignorance regarding the fsa is hilarious at this point . 
  people like you seriously think everyone not fighting for assad are al-nusra/isis ... which is complete and total bullshit . 
  honestly , i stopped going on / r/worldnews . 
  if you do n't think that literally everyone not allied with assad is a terrorist , you 're a shill/islamic extremist . 
  if you call out assad/russia for indiscriminate killings of civilians no where near isis , you get called a shill/islamic extremist . 
  it 's fucking ridiculous how much of a propaganda echo chamber it has become . 
  exactly . 
  turkish businessmen likely bought 2nd/3rd hand products originating in isis territory . 
  the same holds true for iraq , iraqi kurdistan , jordan , fsa , etc. 
  the only ** government ** known to be buying straight from isis though , has been assad 's . 
  yeah , that 's exactly it . 
  territorial airspace only exists for 20 miles past your territory . 
  after that it becomes your adiz . 
  when there 's multiple nations with adizs that overlap , they divide it as evenly as they can , which what that map is . 
  when the countries are immediately next to each other , like say france and spain , your adiz ca n't extend over their territory , so your adiz ends where your territorial airspace ends , at the border . 
  that 's only civilian aircraft interception protocol . 
  military aircraft ? 
  intercept at your adiz if it exists . 
  if it enters your territorial airspace , you bring it down and ask questions later . 
  since it was a land border , there 's no adiz , so there was no chance of adiz interception . 
  turkey did nothing wrong . 
  russia however , violated turkish airspace , and blames it on their inability to follow icao regulations , which states every single aircraft needs to be listening to 121.5 mhz . 
  if russia did n't hear the calls , it 's their fault they put up a bird that was n't in accordance with icao regulations ... 
  it 's referred to as the adiz , , or the air defense identification zone . 
  it 's not your territorial airspace , but you `` control '' it via the right to monitor what 's there . 
  russian aircraft are intercepted in the adiz , not the territorial airspace . 
  if they broke the air space ... that 's a completely different story , and regularly results in a shoot down . 
  when it 's a border of 2 nations however , your adiz ends just as your airspace does , so you do n't have that adiz buffer like uk does over the north sea , or germany with the baltic sea, 
  f-35bs were already declared operational . 
  uk carriers will be operating with usmc aircraft for a while , until the rnfaa get their sea legs back, 
  because saudi arabian government has nothing to do with isis ' power gains ? 
  people idiotically point at house of saud for isis ' funding , but house of saud is n't fucking funding isis . 
  * individuals * in saudi arabia are funding isis . 
  saudi arabia has arrested over 400 people for funding isis . 
  saudi arabia was one of the first nations to join the fight against isis . 
  they backed off when iran armed the houthis in yemen , but that makes sense , since yemen 's directly on their border , while isis is n't . 
  why the fuck would house of saud help isis in any way , when isis has threatened to kill every member of the house of saud ? 
  they 're not fucking morons like so many people apparently think they are ... why would they support isis , who 's bringing iraq and iran closer together ? 
  house of saud wants a nation friendly with iran directly on their border ? 
  seriously ? 
  why would they support isis , who 's openly attacking multiple allies of theirs ? 
  house of saud has nothing to lose if isis tackles egypt or jordan ? 
  seriously ? 
  it makes literally ** zero ** sense for house of saud to be helping out isis ... zero . 
  people need to stop with this blatantly idiotic notion . 
  good lord . 
  if you post in certain subreddits , they automatically ban you from theirs . 
  several subs do this sadly . 
  opposition to an eu military ? 
  easy . 
  operation serval ; france 's counter insurgency operation in mali . 
  france wanted to go down here to handle a humanitarian crisis . 
  no one else wanted to , but france sent forces anyways , because they had their own national forces . 
  later on , other nations came to assist , like germany , but day one was france and france alone . 
  now look at it as if there was an eu military . 
  france 's forces are serving in eu regiments , and the eu does n't want to do what france wants to do . 
  what happens ? 
  does france pull its forces out of the eu military , ( but what hardware is theirs to claim ? ), 
  or does france have to go `` oh , i guess we ca n't do anything in mali then , sorry everyone ! '', 
  how does an eu military work , like the us ' military , where each state ( nation in the eu 's case ) has people serving at the eu 's beck and call ? 
  or is it like what the eu ** already ** has , with the eu battlegroups , which are more or less just a political statement ? 
  how do eu nations combine military forces as a whole , when there 's still individual sovereignty , local politics , and geopolitics at play ? 
  mi-8s * are * rockbottom cheap , but there 's a reason for that ... 
  they 're one of the worst maintenance hog rotors in active service , and constantly break down . 
  even then , the mi-8s are n't even * that * great pricewise . 
  they 're $ 15m usd , and you can get a eurocopter ec725 for $ 18m usd , which can carry 50 % more , less prone to breaking , and less intensive maintenance . 
  navy . 
  huge us navy/italian air force base right outside of catania ; nas sigonella, 
  yeah , definitely only the glamour shots of sicily here ... it can be the most beautiful place on earth , but it can very much be a giant trash dump at the same time , especially if there 's a driver strike going on, 
  lived there for 4 years and i speak minimal italian ( languages are hard for me ) , and i had no problems . 
  big cities most can speak english , and everyone who ca n't will work with you for whatever you need or want . 
  never really had a problem what so ever . 
  typhoon actually * should * be the better plane , but the reality is , it 's not .
