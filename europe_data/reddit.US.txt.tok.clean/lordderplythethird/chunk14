  that is 100 % false , and you should know what you 're talking about before speaking . 
  us problems in vietnam were n't because of the lack of a cannon , that 's 100 % proven . 
  usaf and usn both used f-4s , and had similar k/d ratios of 3:1 . 
  usaf added a gun , but at the cost of a smaller radar . 
  their k/d ratio actually got worse , 2:1 . 
  usn taught their pilots better missile targeting control , and saw their k/d ratio skyrocket to over 10:1 . 
  sure it was the lack of a gun ? 
  because history says this is false ... 
  there 's been as many air to air kills with a cannon over the past 30 years as there has been air to air kills by dropping a bomb on the enemy aircraft . 
  1 helicopter shot down by an a-10 , 1 helicopter taken out with a jdam from a helicopter . 
  you can dodge direct los to avoid cannon fire . 
  you ca n't avoid an aim-9x with 180 ^ ^ 0 targeting . 
   we can not trust the us and uk regarding hardware . 
  uhhhh ... you 're aware that the us is the single largest supplier of military hardware to india , right ? 
  * c-17s * c-130js * m777s * chinooks * stingers * apaches all large us sales to india over the past 5 years , many over the past year alone . 
  us is india 's # 1 foreign military supplier , has been for roughly 5 years now ... russia is n't really getting any new contracts out of india . 
  it 's almost exclusively finishing previous orders now , with nothing new on the horizon . 
  there 's also the fact that the us is helping india develop it 's own 5th generation fighter , the amca , and helping to develop india 's own emals catobar carrier , and helping india with developing its bmd system . 
  us-india military relations have changed radically over the past 10 years . 
  what you 're saying was true a decade ago , but is certainly not true today . 
  honestly , its the all around better aircraft of the two . 
  * more range * more munitions loadout capabilities * better radar * cheaper * its irst is less advanced , but works far better anyways * actually has competent air to ground capabilities * lower operating cost eurofighter program is why no one wants to work with germany on a tornado replacment program . 
  just such an epic clusterfuck that really killed the pogram 's capabilities . 
  su-30mki can , but indian air force is pretty pissed off with russian fighters right now due to the near endless troubles they 're having . 
  they also want to simply diversify where they 're getting weapon systems from , not only to get more technology to increase their domestic programs , but because there 's the possibility that in a conflict with china , russia would cut india off for its largest trading partner, 
  well that 's just absolutely adorable . 
  shown facts , and instead of being a rational human and admitting your idea and perception might be wrong , you downvote and throw accusations at me , and attempt to belittle me ... 
  it must suck to live a life where you 're so easily offended by something that offers actually no offense to you . 
  i hope you find solace soon : /, 
  the image was released by the russian mod , along with dozens of other photos of their fighters with garmin handheld gps systems . 
  the fact that it 's a garmin does n't mean it does n't have glonass . 
  in fact , that exact model , the garmin gpsmap 64 , is a dual gps-glonass system . 
  it 's 100 % a russian su-24 , and it 's 100 % a handheld gps/glonass system . 
  these are facts . 
  it does n't matter where you may have first seen it , it was a press release from the mod , and it blew up on the internet in general . 
  the photo was released by the russian mod itself lol ... ruaf released a photo of their mig-29 airshow aircraft 's cockpit , and also shows a handheld gps system ... https://theaviationist.com/2016/03/11/do-you-notice-anything-weird-in-this-cool-shot-of-a-mig-29-flying-rolling-above-russian-aircraft-carrier/ it 's widely known most every aircraft in the ruaf uses handheld gps systems for their guidance ... it 's not something new or revolutionary . 
  it 's been known for a while , along with the fact that most of their aircraft have no built in gps , but rather use handheld commerial grade gps systems for guidance during flight . 
  a lot of their fighters also fly against icao regulations regarding monitoring guard channel 243 ( frequency 121.5 ) ( emergency warning and interception channel ) . 
  for example , [ here is the cockpit of a russian su-24 ] ( https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--18evo8af--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/1247964316885102951.jpg ) . 
  notice the handheld garmin looking gps system ? 
  that 's the su-24 's only gps system . 
  ever used one of those systems ? 
  they 're usually off by quite a bit on your exact location . 
  now travel at 650kmph near a non-friendly border , with a less than reliable gps , no transponder , and the inability to monitor channel 243 ... and they wonder why their su-24 got shot down over turkey . 
  isis did n't become `` waswas '' because of russia . 
  that would mean russia actually targets isis , which they largely do n't . 
  russia targets the non-isis rebels , because those are closer to assad , and thus the bigger threat to assad . 
  russia targeted non-isis forces more last month alone , than they have isis since they entered the conflict . 
  there 's been a grand total of ** 161 ** russian airstrikes on isis since the day russia entered the conflict . 
  there 's been ** 2,000-3 ,000 ** airstrikes on non-isis rebels forces . 
  in contrast , us ' coalition has conducted ** 14,800 ** on isis . 
  us coalition had over double russia 's total airstrikes against isis forces in syria last month alone ( ** 352 ** ) ( not even accounting for the 320 airstrikes against isis in iraq last month ) . 
  denmark has carried out ** 200 ** airstrikes against isis forces between syria and iraq , meaning denmark , a country with just 60 fighter jets , has carried out more airstrikes against isis than russia has . 
  russian airstrikes have done virtually ** nothing ** towards isis . 
  coalition airstrikes and forces on the ground are what 's repelled isis ' gains . 
  [ understanding war ( one of the best for reporting on airstrikes imo ) releases a monthly report on airstrikes , and business insider simply took uw 's reports and made a record of all airstrikes listed ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/maps-show-progression-of-russian-airstrikes-in-syria-2016-7 ) [ airwars reports the data for all coalition strikes , broken down by which nation performed how many ] ( https://airwars.org/data/ ) to say isis has become `` waswas '' because of russia , is simply 100 % false , and ignorant to the reality of who 's actually targeting isis , which certainly is n't russia . 
  i really wish people stopped lapping up rt and sputnik like a dog with water , as if it 's not propaganda meant to persuade people with weak cognitive abilities . 
  manning took over ** 700,000 ** documents . 
  there 's literally 0 chance they read all of them , which means they took information off sipr ( secret internet ) and jwics ( top secret internet ) , and gave it out to a 3rd party with zero clearance or need to know , without even fully knowing what the fuck was contained on those documents . 
  just because wikileaks * may * have censored what they published , preventing anyone 's life from being put at risk , does n't mean manning did the same . 
  it 's 100 % obvious manning took documents without knowing what they contained and gave them out . 
  manning 's prison term is exactly what is deserved . 
  wikileaks * did * have a treasurechest of information on russia , which assange once boasted about and announced he was about to release . 
  soon after , the fsb threatened to destroy wikileaks and everyone involved in it . 
  since then , there 's been literally not 1 single bad thing about russia put out by wikileaks . 
  it 's not a lack of information , that 's 100 % for sure . 
  i thought there were n't russians in ukraine though ... how can the right wing neonazis be torturing , raping , and murdering russians , if there 's no russians in ukraine ? 
  it 's all seperatists fighting against those people i thought ? 
  or did you get your propaganda wires mixed up again bonne ? 
  nor nothing to do with the blatant illegal annexation of territory , in violation of international agreements russia itself signed . 
  budapest memorandum for the security of ukraine comes to mind . 
  i suppose that 's just washington propaganda too though . 
  i have romek tagged , and tagged for good reason . 
  you can read his post history and decide what the tag is lol, 
  the entire tpp was released . 
  every single line . 
  ttip is still being written . 
  kind of hard to release what it says , when it 's still being written ... you want the next harry potter movie while they 're still writing the book ? 
  because that 's the logic you 're displaying right now . 
  ttip will likely be released for public viewing * after * it 's language has been finalized , and before it gets voted on ... no different than the tpp , which everyone cried out that they were n't getting a chance to read because they could n't read it as it was being written . 
  i have n't read every single section of the tpp , but i * have * honestly read a lot of it . 
  enough to see the media greatly exaggerated certain aspects of it , and straight up lied about other sections . 
  ie :  `` it 's setting back our environmental protection laws by at least a decade ! '', 
  no , it 's setting a minimum standard that all parties must adhere to . 
  you can always exceed the minimum standards , but you can never dip below them . 
  it forces developing nations like vietnam to meet more strict ( but realisticly obtainable ) environmental protection standards than what they meet now , while doing nothing to diminish the us ' more strict standards . 
  pure fearmongering and lying , for the sake of clickbait . 
  the igorance and arrogance of some , i swear will be the death of me . 
  tpp has been openly available to read for a year now ... what the fuck are you going on about ? 
  it 's the exact same in the us for the tpp . 
  people go on about how it 's going to ravage the middle class , when virtually every study shows mild to medium gains across the board . 
  globalization is a big boogieman to some though , so got ta fear monger and speculate about the horrors that could be , instead of addressing reality . 
  ypg has literally sworn allegiance to ocalan and the congra el ... that 's like romania calling hollande their leader , and french parliament as their legislature , but trying to say romania is n't sided with france at all . 
  ypg 's own fighters say the terms are interchangable , as they 're all members of the pkk . 
  there 's clear historical data showcasing the ypg arming , funding , and allowing the pkk to use ypg territory as a springboard for attacks on turkey . 
  to say they 're not even sided with them ? 
  that 's just a full on 100 % lie . 
  to say they 're not essentially the same thing ? 
  that 's 100 % white washing . 
   he 's still more pro-kurdish than almost all his political opponents he 's actually the most pro-kurdish pm/president turkey 's ever had lol .
