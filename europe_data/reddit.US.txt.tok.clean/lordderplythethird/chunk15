  post coup attempt , literally every single political party in turkey announced their disapproval of the coup , and voiced that they would support the people 's election results ... last election withstanding , kurds overwhelmingly voted for the akp , erdogan 's party . 
  the resentment , is more so between turkey and the pkk , not turkey and kurds . 
  their view on this is incorrect , and seems to be based off the circlejerk on reddit of `` hurdur turkey hates kurds '' , except for the fact that two of iraqi kurdistan 's biggest allies are turkey and israel , which kind of drives a wedge into that fictional narrative . 
  the source of the bombings is twofold ; 1 . 
  isis is getting desperate , and need to stur up conflict to bring in more recruits 2 . 
  pkk feel like erdogan helps isis , because he wo n't let them go to syria ( because he feels , and most intelligence agrees with him , that they 're just going to use it to rearm and prepare for more attacks on turkey ) , so pkk does what they always do ; resort to terrorism . 
  no we do n't . 
  we 've used romanian air bases as stops along the way to get supplies to the middle east , and we 've rotated out aircraft there as a `` see , we care about you '' show of force to romania , but there 's 0 permanently deployed us aircraft to romania . 
  heck , there 's not even a regularly scheduled rotation of aircraft to romania . 
  it 's just when they get worried , we send a few there to calm them down , maybe do an airshow , and then to leave . 
  for example , the f-22 deployment there in april , which lasted all of a week . 
  * 71st air base - 0 us aircraft - a-10s were just here for a month for a training exercise . 
  have subsequently returned home , bringing us presence at the base back to 0 * 86th air base - 0 us aircraft * 90th air base - 0 us aircraft * 95th air base - 0 us aircraft, 
  they 're not ballistic missiles ... 
  they 're b61 gravity bombs . 
  you strap them to a jet or bomber , and drop them over your target . 
  only a few kinds of aircraft are capable of handling them , and mig-21s are not , and mig-21s are the only combat aircraft in romania . 
  okay , that makes more sense haha . 
  i thought you were trying to say the lafayette was a fremm class ship and i was like noooooooooo, 
  lafayette is n't of the fremm class ... lafayette is a class of frigates france developed in the 1990s , with the first comissioned in 1996 . 
  fremm is a class of frigates ( though size and displacement is that of a destroyer ) france and italy developed in the 2000s , with the first comissioned in 2012 . 
  france has 5 lafayettes , and 3 fremms . 
  just because a single ship did fine does n't mean it 's not an issue ... 
  it 's a proven fact the mod and rolls royce ( made the engines ) have even admitted to , that the engines of the type 45 are `` less reliable '' ( mod 's words , not mine ) , in tropical climates , which results in engine outages . 
  http://www.janes.com/article/61089/inquiry-reveals-uk-s-type-45-destroyers-are-even-less-reliable-in-warm-water there 's a reason they 're supposed to get new generators to alleviate the issue tropical climates have on the ships ... 
  so you 're flat out denying that trump 's top advisor , paul manafort , was in fact the top aide to russian ally and former ukrainian president , viktor yanukovych , nevermind all his connections to russian billionares wanted by the us and several other governments for a multitude of corruption and fraud charges ? 
  you 're flat out denying that trump 's foreign policy advisor , carter page , was a former advisor and currently large investor to the russian government-owned gas company , gazprom , which openly and reguarly calls for the us to stop acting aggressively to russia ?

  correct . 
  the rest of the unit was in shambles though ... missing over 14,000 pieces of equipment they needed to deploy . 
  the single joke regarding broomsticks does n't mean the rest of it was a joke as well ...  ** panzergrenadier battalion 371 : **  panzergrenadiers are the bundeswehr 's mechanized infantry . 
  germany has nine panzergrenadier battalions -- each fields 900 men , roughly fifty infantry fighting vehicles and milan and panzerfaust 3 anti-tank weapons . 
   last february , panzergrenadier battalion 371 , based in marienburg , was participating in a nato exercise in norway . 
  news quickly spread that the battalion , part of nato 's rapid reaction force , suffered from a shortage of pistols and night vision goggles . 
  a shortage of mg3 machine guns meant broomsticks were painted black and pressed into service to simulate them . 
  a new report states that the situation was even worse : ** panzergrenadier battalion 371 had to borrow 14,371 pieces of equipment from a total of 56 other bundeswehr units ... and it was still short on equipment . 
  ** http://nationalinterest.org/feature/germanys-military-dying-13748?page=2 edit : i love downvotes for proving a point , with facts to back it up ... amazing . 
  the broomstick part was , the rest of it , where that unit had to borrow over 15,000 pieces of equipment in order to deploy to the exercise , was n't a joke . 
  thank god for posts like this ... added a buuunnnnch of res tags to some users for future warning lol . 
  good god, 
  daesh lol . 
  russia wo n't touch daesh , and bomb forces like the new syrian army that ** only ** fight daesh , while campioning that they 're defeating isis singlehandedly , and the fucking russiastronk trolls like romek just lap it up and spew it out . 
   and should a war , a mass killing of people and extra-legal application of force , be allowed just because it benefits one state ? 
  well , i really doubt that 's what you could call operation serval , the operation were literally no one sent combat forces to assist france ... but okay . 
  that 's a really twisted way of thinking , that kind of scares me honestly . 
  coalition against isis . 
  what 's germany doing ? 
  not a fucking thing . 
  what 's france doing ? 
  bombing them more than any other european state , with the exception of the uk . 
  france has been hit by what , 3 isis attacks now ? 
  bombing isis * could * be argued that it only benefits france , although i really hope no one tries to argue that fallacy , but the reality is that it benefits everyone , it 's backed by un resolutions , and it 's objectifably morally just . 
  but there 's still states that openly ** refuse ** to take part . 
  what do you think french politicans are doing right now ? 
  sitting around going :  hey , we 've been hit 3x by isis now , and some of the nations we 'd be joining our army with openly refuse to attack them , but joining our armies is good for us or  lets looks at this precidence . 
  our forces would be joined with them , but they refuse to engage the people that have attacked us . 
  maybe we should keep our forces seperate , so that we do n't lose our ability to attack those who attack us . 
  i can almost guarentee its the second . 
  it 's quite simple honestly . 
  the precidence has been set , and its been set for decades now . 
  european powers may get closer together , but a european military is absolutely impossible , until a multitude of nations change their mindset , and are willing to die in the interest of another nation . 
  until that happens , nations like france and the uk will openly refuse to allow another nation to jepordize their sovereignty and ability to defend themselves . 
  simple as that . 
  china is following the doctrine of russia . 
  adding a few new pieces here and there , but still overly reliant on generations old , and ** highly ** obsolete hardware , with zero plans set up for replacement . 
  their navy has the type 052d destroyers , which are insanely impressive . 
  except they only have a handful , and are overwhelmingly reliant on their type 051 destroyers , which are oversized frigates at best . 
  their type 054a frigates are impressive , but again there 's only a handful , and they 're still overly reliant on their shitty type 053 frigates , which when they * do * work , are nothing more than suicide missile boats . 
  there 's zero plans for the serious replacement of either the 051s or the 053s . 
  their af is still using the mig-21 bootleg j-7s . 
  even india 's already phasing out their mig-21s , but china 's still going to be using theirs in bulk for the foreseeable future , with no real replacement in sight . 
  that , and their production capabilities for their military is ironically seemingly nonexistant . 
  the only fighter they 've been able to pump out solid numbers in a short time span lately , has been the j-10 , and that 's probably because the j-10 is a 1990s airframe utilizing generations old technology . 
  because war can be in the best interest of one nation , while not in the other . 
  they 're not . 
  germany did n't send troops to mali to help france until operation serval was already over , and was replaced by a un peacekeeping mission . 
  there 's a ** massive ** difference . 
  stabilizing libya is in everyone 's interest , but more so italy 's interest , yet many want nothing to do with the effort required to stabilize it . 
  and you never know when the rest of europe is going to look at spain like it looks at italy and shrugs . 
  gmd would like a word with you . 
  it 's not 100 % , but when they do n't constantly try new things with it , radically effecting its success rate , it * does * actually intercept icbms . 
  and china has virtually nothing for amphibious operations . 
  it 's going to take more than sending 2000 troops at a time to do ** anything ** to taiwan . 
  their blue water amphib fleet consists of ... 4 ? 
  ships . 
  4 ships with a combined 1500-2000 troops . 
  even if none of the ships get sunk , that 's all china can deploy to taiwan . 
  china has n't had a successful war in how long ? 
  their troops have literally zero combat training . 
  their troops go to virtually zero international training missions and exercises . 
  they have no known army doctrine outside of `` look at how many soldiers we have . 
  china 's military is still overwhelmingly reliant on 1950s and 60s tech , specifically their airforce , where almost a third of their fighter fleet are 1950s era mig-21 knockoffs . 
  china , along with germany , are the best examples of paper tigers in this era . 
  it just wo n't work , because no nation is going to be willing to send their soldiers to die in the name of another country 's geopolitical aspirations . 
  you wo n't see german troops sent to mali for france 's gain . 
  you wo n't see spanish troops sent to libya for italy 's gain . 
  it 's not even nationalism that plagues the concept of a european military . 
  it 's that no one really trusts another to fight for them . 
  france is supposed to expect germans to be willing to fight on their behalf regarding something that effects france 's foreign relations ? 
  you * really * expect to see german troops in mali fighting a conflict in the name of french geopolitics ?
