  you * really * expect to see spanish troops in libya fighting in the name of italian geopolitics ? 
  and once they refuse , the entire european army concept goes out the window instantly . 
  summer is usually proud manta out of sicily , or whatever they changed the name to now . 
  still an asw exercise , but in the medd , not near the uk, 
  all monetary comparisons are idiotic , which is why no organizations and think tanks do so . 
  ppp does n't account almost everyone 's housing in russia is free from the soviet times , which has a huge impact on their economic figures . 
  nor does it account for dozens of other issues that radically adjust economic issues . 
  good luck finding a single defense journalist or think tank that uses monetary comparisons . 
  on people on reddit and ignorant media do so , in order to push false biases . 
  33 % is payroll alone, 
  no offense , but spending figures are 100 % pointless to use , unless you grasp the radical differences in the different countries . 
  how much does a uk soldier make ? 
  private makes $ 2200 a month . 
  a russian private ? 
  just $ 400 . 
  11 russian soldiers , for the cost of just 2 british ones . 
  now consider the wages of the bloke making the challenger tank , vs vlad making the armada . 
  $ to $ , $ to $ , # to # , etc are entirely useless figures to compare militaries . 
  i wish people understood this, 
  us ** has ** pushed for eu forces in the scs ... eu leaders have overwhelmingly said it has nothing to do with them ... http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-eu-southchinasea-iduskcn0q401b20150730 http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlee75/2016/03/05/we-need-europes-help-in-the-south-china-sea/#7ba4fe3d5a40 merkle believes words should be enough ( go figure ) , while france is asking for more eu nations to join . 
  ** 5eyes ** * australia * canada * new zealand * united kingdom * united states ** 9eyes ** * 5eyes * denmark * france * netherlands * norway ** 14eyes ** * 9eyes * belguim * germany * italy * spain * sweden yeah , no 5eyes members , but plenty of 9eyes and 14eyes just the same , and with as close as france and germany are to 5eyes ( both tried to join 5eyes ) , it does n't matter, 
  russia gets ** significantly ** more bang for their buck , because of their rock bottom cost of living . 
  us has roughly the same amount of troops as russia , yet pays more in troop salaries alone than russia 's entire military budget . 
  comparing $ to $ , $ to $ , # to # , is pointless because it does n't account for any of that . 
  serbian militias were * so * incapable of defending themselves from nato , the poor souls ... kind of like the victims of the srebrenica , vu\u010ditrn , gornje obrinje , vukovar , dalj , erdut , lovas , saborsko , bru\u0161ka , etc etc etc etc etc massacres committed by serbian forces ... not like the serbian forces nato attacked were responsible for the single greatest human rights atrocity in europe since hitler or anything ... 
  and there 's a direct access to the medd from the black sea ... tartus was n't a functional naval base , so the base in crimea was their entrance to the medd . 
  no ship was home ported there . 
  it was basically an emergency refueling/rearming base that could no longer do either long before syria went to shit . 
  the base in crimea is russia 's only real base to the medd . 
  only for certain parts of the it field . 
  work anywhere near classified or confidential information or systems that hold that kind of information , and you 're not going to be touched . 
  work help desk/basic tier 2 ? 
  yeah you 're probably screwed, 
  tartus was n't valuable ... 
  it had literally 2 docks , with both deemed unusable , and roughly only a dozen people working it ... 
  it was basically a paycheck away from not existing ... 
  does it ** far ** cheaper too . 
   i 'm sorry you think the poor and the dregs of society are literal subhumans who should have no rights thats super fucked up . 
  thank you for putting words in my mouth , because you lack comprehension skills ... 
  thank you . 
  i love when people lack the intelligence and maturity to comprehend something , and in turn resort to mud flinging and blatantly lying/twisting words to hell to rationalize their own viewpoint against reality . 
  [ the truth of the matter ] ( https://i.imgur.com/snedxwa.png ) is simply that the old , poor , and uneducated gave literally not 1 fuck about anyone other than them self with this vote , when they 've been absolutely hounded non-stop about how badly brexit is for gibraltar , northern ireland , scotland , and the uk economy . 
  they , simply put , did n't care about their fellow countrymen , and only cared about their nationalism and their idiotic notion that the eu is the cause of their problems , not the morons they keep electing to office . 
  if that 's too much for you to comprehend , that 's fine , but that 's on you ... but do n't you fucking dare put words in my mouth that are not even close to what i said , just to justify your views that are n't based in reality . 
  you can fuck right off with that . 
  stupidity seems to almost always topple wisdom as well, 
  when it was the old , poor , and uneducated that flooded the `` exit '' ballots , even as scotland , northern ireland , gibraltar , virtually every economist , and virtually every world leader said it was a piss poor idea ... 
  nothing they said was going to change the vote . 
  ignorant and uneducated nationalists did what they wanted , everyone else in the uk be damned . 
  except isis and al qaeda openly fight each other ? 
  al qaeda did n't become isis . . isis was an insurgent group in iraq that swore allegiance to al qaeda , but never really * did * anything involving al qaeda . 
  they basically swore alliegance just to gain fame during the iraq insurgency . 
  once the iraq shia insurgency kicked off in 2006 , their group gained a lot more supporters . 
  as the sectarian civil war raged in iraq , the group gained more supporters , until they finally shed off their al qaeda allegiance that only existed on paper , and declared themselves the islamic state , at which point , al qaeda declared war on them . 
  i 'd have to say southern italy is europe 's mississippi , particularly sicily ... having spent a good amount of time both places ( have n't been to croatia though sadly ) i feel that 's a fairly apt comparison haha, 
  filthy rich for the us , yes . 
  filthy rich for alabama , yes . 
  alabama 's cost of living is damn near rock bottom . 
  i live between dc and baltimore for example , and if i moved * anywhere * in alabama ; | item | percentage change | | : -- | : -- | food | 14 % less housing | 40 % less transportation | 12 % less healthcare | 10 % less utilities | 12 % more if i lived in los angeles and moved there , it 'd be ; | item | percentage change | | : -- | : -- | food | 9 % less housing | 66 % less transportation | 14 % less healthcare | 27 % less utilities | 14 % less if i got a job in alabama near the salary i get now , i 'm living like a king there , while here it 's just comfortable middle class . 
  2011 us stated it . 
  it 's not really regarding , say , russia hacking airbus . 
  it 's so that , say , china hacks the dams and levees of belguim and floods it , belguim can invoke article 5 . 
  it gives nato states the ability to envoke article 5 if a massive cyber attack meant to do serious damage to the nation hits them . 
  and they should have that ability . 
  it 's the 21st century , and telecommunications rules basically every aspect of our lives and is used to control everything . 
  guns are n't illegal in the uk . 
  you can still buy shotguns , bolt action rifles , semi automatic rifles ( if they 're .22 calibre at least ) , and `` long barrel '' pistols . 
  however , the reports * as of right now * make it out to be either homemade , or an antique, 
  shame on me ... fool me twice ... shame on ... * thinks for a second * well , you ca n't be fooled again !, 
  poor baby bush ... he 's not a dumb man by any stretch , but damn if he is n't probably the single worst public speaker i have ever witnessed, 
  32 t-38s germany owns stationed in the us , and another 23 eurofighter typhoon dual seaters , which are used to train eurofighter pilots for their single seaters , so roughly 55 trainer jets, 
  airwars.org does probably the best at documenting the air campaign against isis . 
  it 's not perfect , but it 's imo the best there is, 
  us supported the mujahideen , who went on to form the northern alliance , ** who fought against ** the taliban and al qaeda in the afghanistan civil war after the soviet invasion , and happened to lose to them , so they fled north to uzbekistan and tajikistan until the us invaded afghanistan after 9/11 , where they worked with the us and coalition forces to remove the taliban from power ... 
  the mujahideen groups who went on to form the taliban and al qaeda were sponsored by the isi in pakistan ... nevermind isis and the taliban/al qaeda absolutely hate each other and virtually none of isis ' members came from al qaeda/taliban ... their only connection is that in the late 90s , jama'at al-tawhid wal-jihad ( now referred to as isis ) had sworn allegience to al qaeda , but were never really members of al qaeda . 
  they subsequently had really nothing to do with al qaeda , and al qaeda ended up declaring war on them in ... 2014 ? 
  i believe, 
  except it was sarkozy who demanded nato action in syria , stating he would never accept assad 's continued reign and nato must do everything it can to remove him from power and bring democracy to syria ... hell , libya was him ( and cameron as well ) too ... dude was practically foaming at the mouth in 2010 for libya and again in 2011-2012 for syria ... 
  but , people like to forget all that , and just want to blame the us for both i suppose lol . 
  unlike germany however , poland only has realistically 48 fighters , including trainer jets . 
  germany has more trainer jets alone than that ... 
  it 's like saying france 's contribution of 10 % of sorties vs the us ' contribution of 67 % is lame . 
  or the netherlands performing only 3/5ths as many sorties as france is lame . 
  it completely neglects the difference in size and capabilities ... 
  honestly , the only ones who can really decry others ' contributions against isis as `` lame '' , is the netherlands . 
  less than 1/5th the fighter inventory of france/uk/germany / etc , and conducting 3/5ths as many flight ops . 
   i 've already replied for the same complain here . 
  and your `` reply '' has literally fuck all to do with this . 
  your reply is about the ability to swap out sm-3s with tomahawks , and that * is * true ... except for all the coding changes it would require , and the fact it would be a blatant violation of the inf ... which if russia gave a fuck about the inf , they should n't have broken it when they stationed srbms and mrbms in kalingrad ...  for example , they already deployed this missiles , which are able to hit icbms . 
  literally the ** first line ** : * `` the rim-161 standard missile 3 ( sm-3 ) is a ship-based missile system used by the united states navy to intercept short-to intermediate-range ballistic missiles '' and a few lines later : * `` a significant improvement in this respect , the sm-3 block ii variant widens the missile 's diameter from 0.34 m ( 13.5 in ) to .53 m ( 21 in ) , making it more suitable against intermediate-range ballistic missiles '' do n't you dare fucking tell me i do n't know anything about abm , when you obivously do n't know a thing about what irbms , slbms , srbms , and icbms are . 
  slbms and icbms , are ** not ** short-to-intermediate range ballistic missiles . 
  simple as that . 
  if you do n't understand that , that 's fine , but that 's on you and that does n't magically change what sm-3s do . 
  not all ballistic missiles are the same . 
  being able to intercept 1 kind , does n't magically mean you can any kind . 
  it does n't work that way . 
  if it did , even early patriot missile systems would work against icbms , since they were shooting down iraqi scuds in desert storm ...  if abm system is against iran and other middle east threats , why do n't nato build abm system in turkey and greece ? 
  they are much closer to iran , so the system would be much more effective . 
  if you wanted an answer to you own question , you could easily look it up , instead of choosing to bury your head and in the sand and pretending the answers are n't readily available online ... sm-3s have an extremely long range . 
  thus , it makes the most logical sense to keep them further away , and when a missile is detected , they go out and intercept it .
