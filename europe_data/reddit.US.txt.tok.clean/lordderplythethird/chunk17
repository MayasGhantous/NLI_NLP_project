  putting it closer to the threat , say greece or turkey , decreases their reaction time , and thus decreasing their ability to intercept . 
  you put radars in greece and turkey ( like they 're doing ) and put the missiles further back . 
  as soon as the radars pick something up , the missile launches , and if it misses , you have enough time to launch another one . 
  putting the missiles in turkey , means you get basically 1 shot , and if you miss ... well , you do n't want to think of what happens then . 
  who does n't comprehend mad ? 
  you really think aegis ashore bmd going up in poland and such is a threat to icbms and slbms ? 
  because it 's not . 
  it absolutely ** can not ** intercept icbms and slbms . 
  it can only handle shorter range mrbms and srbms , like those iran 's been investing in and selling to states like syria . 
  virtually russia 's entire nuclear weapons arsenal , is slbms and icbms , thus aegis ashore bmd does literally ** nothing ** to contradict mad . 
  nothing . 
  literally the ** only ** weapon system capable of intercepting an icbm or slbm , is gmd , and those are strictly within the us , alaska and california to be exact . 
  even then , there 's roughly only a dozen or so gmd missiles in place at either site , and they have basically a 50 % interception rate ... so not exactly a threat to mad ... russia , and more specifically putin , is just an angry toddler throwing a temper tantrum over anything that threatens his ability to conquer what he 's repeatedly alluded to viewing as part of russia . 
  the aegis ashore bmd only deters russia 's conventially equipped short range ballistic missiles , which they would use to target military structures and command/control centers in the event of an invasion . 
  yeah , how fucking ** dare ** they defend against that , and iranian short range ballistic missiles making their way closer to europe ... how fucking dare they ... / s, 
  ahhh . 
  iirc , the dorsal spine is for some of the electronics . 
  and i think i misspoke , it 's actually the block 52 ** + ** that has the dorsal spine , not the block 52 . 
  i do n't believe block 60s ( f-16e like uae uses ) kept the dorsal spine for 1 reason or another . 
  haha yeah , it makes them look like an entirely different jet from above . 
  you can tell if its got the cfts though , since they [ make it look like a block from above ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/israeli_f-16s_at_red_flag2.jpg ), 
  nope , it 's just a [ block 52 f-16d ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/425th_fighter_squadron_-_lockheed_f-16d_block_52_fighting_falcon_94-0282.jpg ) . 
  dual cockpit , with an enlarged dorsel fin . 
  really the only time they 're not seen with them , is air shows and flight testing . 
  anything involving a combat operation with them is gon na see them using drop tanks, 
  apparently it was more than a few months ago ( october ) but here ya go http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/strike/2015/10/13/germany-suspends-eurofighter-deliveries-due-quality-problems/73871500/, 
  again , the max speed does n't exist when weapons are added ... 
  it 's like saying your car can go 400kmph , but you always have to haul a trailer behind it , so it can never reach that speed except at drag races . 
  in combat , a eurofighters top speed of 2500kmph does not exist . 
  hell , with droptanks alone , it likely ca n't even break mach 1 lol ... 
  because max speed is a completely useless figure for fighter jets . 
  you ca n't throw weapons on an aircraft , and seriously expect it 's max speed to be relevant . 
  how fast does a formula 1 car go ? 
  well throw a mattress on it . 
  how fast does it go now ? 
  sure , the eurofighters max speed is 2500kmph . 
  problem is , eurofighters require droptanks because their range is garbage , requiring 3 droptanks for missions only 500 miles away . 
  add some aams and bombs , and you 've doubled it 's frontal design , effectively killing it 's performance and making it extremely slow and lumbersome . 
  that 's why no one uses it ; it 's 100 % pointless out of airshows . 
  german air force is notorious for having aircraft grounded for 1 safety reason or another . 
  the 2 biggest culprits are the eurofighter typhoon and the a400m . 
  both experienced major issues over the past 2 weeks , with basically all of them being grounded because of it . 
  and the uk 's spending has been dropping constantly , and finally dropped below 2 % this year ... 
  so why do n't you get your own fucking house in order , before talking shit about the east ? 
  lest we forget whose forces have deploy to the uk to find submarines off the coast , because the uk 's military is too fucking incompetent and underfunded to afford asw platforms ... 
  but yeah , lets be a cheeky cunt and shit talk the east while your own house is fucking up . 
  french navy is larger than the uks , and the italian navy is right behind it ... uk 's navy ai n't exactly top of the world anymore ... has n't been for a while . 
   global trade will be fine . 
  until you realize over 50 % of ocean freighters use the south china sea ... how do you think europe gets all the goods it gets from china ? 
  japan ? 
  indonesia ? 
  yeah , if you 're completely oblivious to where your goods from from , and the routes they take , sure , global trade will be fine . 
  so will your next visit to narnia . 
  but in reality , narnia does n't exist , and global trade will ** not ** be fine . 
  it 's what we always called them when i lived in italy haha, 
  it sounds more akin to the us ' national guard than it does militias . 
  basically , an auxillery reserve force that gets periodic training thoughout the year , but does n't require the costs of an active duty member . 
  that way they can keep their costs down , but can still get a large number of people military training , and have a large reserve force they can recall into active duty should the situation call for it . 
  reserve forces , which poland has , are primarily non-combat positions . 
  they 're so that when combat begins , you 're not spending months on end training the people that make a military actually work ; radio operators , mechanics , etc etc. 
  national guard and paramilitary forces are more geared around suplimenting combat arms , or the combat troops . 
  they do different training and focus more so on the combat aspect . 
  they do n't train 24/7 like active military does , but they do n't cost anywhere near what active military does either . 
  it allows you to swell your combat personnel from say 50000 , to say 120000 , but for only the cost of maybe 75000 , should a situation ever occur . 
  most nations on earth have them honestly ... * national task force in sweden * carebears ( carabinieri ) in italy * national gendarmerie in france * national guard in latvia * royal marechaussee in denmark * civil guard in spain * gendarmery in serbia * joint european gendarmerie force in eu * action division in france * rifleman 's union in lithuania they can be anything from a reserve unit that can get called up , like the national guard , or simply a police force that 's trained in combat and can get mobilized should a situation occur , like the carebears . 
  nah , [ you just load it all onto pallets and throw it in like they do luggage ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2syonyllizw/vum1gjy3jki/aaaaaaaardq/qadwhcka1-owy5i4luagrvogxwiv7smoq/s1600/ed-force-one-18-2-16-49819.jpg ), 
  nope , that 's why they went with a 747 actually . 
  it had enough room to carry the band , their crew , and their stage equipment , which allowed them to perform in areas they could n't before . 
  they can basically fit everyone on the top level , which leaves the whole mid level * and * cargo area below for equipment . 
  that 's a ** huge ** amount of space haha . 
  [ not like 747s for cargo is unheard of ] ( http://www.al-airliners.be/k-o/lufthansa/lh747-2f-2.jpg ), 
  talking about how everything is just so * foreign * . 
  ironically , southern part of the us does that as well . 
  it 's mostly the northern states and west coast of the us that are n't like that . 
  well considering that 's what amnesty 's report even states ... that in august aidar battalion started recruiting right wing extremists , and in september , aidar battalion started commiting war crimes ... 
  so , yeah , i guess i * did * manage to pinpoint dates , by reading fucking articles ... lol, 
  this is probably them reading it : `` ah , so only 14 are pbs employees nominated via their own ... but what about those other 12 ?!, 
  i bet they 're governme ... oh , they 're all educators from various aspects of education ... well what about the preside ... oh ... another educator , and everyone voted for them ... ** well they still get government money !, 
  not sure for bbc , but for pbs , it 's done by a board of directors . 
  pbs has 27 members . 
  14 of them are individual station managers , who are voted by the people working underneath them at the station itself . 
  so if i work at rockymountain pbs , i , and everyone i work with , vote on who the manager is for rockymountain pbs , and they become a board member if elected . 
  then , there 's 12 members from outside pbs that the board votes on . 
  currently some of those are : * molly corbett broad - president of american council on education * shae hopkins - ceo of kentucky eductional television * allan landon - assistant dean of university of utah * erroll b. davis jr. - retired superintendent of atlanta public schools etc etc. 
  and then there 's the president , who , again , the board nominates . 
  paula kerger is the current president . 
  before joining pbs , she was the vp of educational broadcasting corporation . 
  then she was voted to one of the 12 outside pbs board member slots , and then voted upon again to become the president . 
  again , not even close to state controlled lol . 
  bbc is * funded * by the british government in the same way pbr is in the us , but they 're not operated and controlled by their governments as well . 
  that 's the difference between them and the likes of interfax , russiatoday , itar , tass , sputniknews , cctv , voice of russia , xinhua , liberation daily , etc. 
  those are funded , owned , and operated by their respective governments . 
  there 's a very easy to see difference between the two , and if you do n't see that , then you 're choosing not to to confirm a bias that 's not based in reality , and there 's really nothing more to say on it . 
  oppossed to media that 's literally owned , funded , and operated by the government itself ... 
  the fuck does college have a damn thing to do with propaganda ? 
  the fuck kind of mental gymnastics did you just perform to attach those 2 completely seperate things together ? 
  the fuck ? 
  but she was captured * before * aidar battalion went to shit . 
  even the deaths of the 2 russian journalists ( who were inside a rebel checkpoint and refused to leave ) she was `` charged '' with , was impossible to be her , as she was captured several hours * before * it occured . 
  nadiya was captured in june of 2014 , and aidar did n't go to shit until august/september/november of 2014 .
