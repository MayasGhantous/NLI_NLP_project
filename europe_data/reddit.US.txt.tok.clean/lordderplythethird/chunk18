  holding her accountable for crimes her unit committed * after * she was captured , is absolutely moronic . 
  ah yes , sputniknews , the propaganda outlet literally created , owned , funded , and operated by the kremlin , by executive order of putin himself . 
  i 'm 100 % sure they 're credible and willing to discuss the blatant violation of the budapest memorandum taken by russia , literally days before protests started . 
  i 'm sure that bastion of free speech and truth will discuss all that in full detail ... / s, 
  the russian good embargo placed against ukraine in retalliation for ukraine turning down the eeu deal from russia , which was a direct violation of the budapest memorandum , which crippled the ukrainian economy , and caused the president to cancel the eu deal he was elected with as his main platform , causing western ukraine to riot , while eastern ukraine wanted whatever appeased russia , as their economy was virtually 100 % based of trade with russia and the trade embargo destroyed them overnight ? 
  * that * cause of the ukranian situation ? 
  or are we engaging in revisionist history like so many want to do ? 
  you did n't offend me , do n't worry . 
  i 'm only saddened by your lack of ability to form a coherent thought , as well as your brashness in feeling its someone else 's fault you have no ability to put your thoughts into actual sentences you mean to say . 
  it 's more sad than anything . 
  but oh well . 
   as in member of the eu , gee some people are so supercilious it hurts . 
  then put your big boy pants on , and speak what the fuck you mean . 
  not my fault you blatantly said 1 thing , but apparently meant another . 
  that 's literally no one 's fault , but your own little head 's . 
   the kapo chief , arnold sinisalu , issued a statement saying there appeared to be no political motivation behind the incident . 
  which is fine ... 
  except for the fact that even russian media confirmed he was taken ** while in estonia ** . 
  so native citizens of estonia can be kidnapped by a foreign government , while in their sovereign nation ... but that 's obviously not an affront to the sovereignty of estonia , right ? 
  the mental gymnastics some try to employ at times is almost olympic-qualifer level , i swear . 
  no , the official statement is from russia 's defense ministery simply stating that the us flew in the sea of japan without transponders on , and because of that it was a risk to civilian aircraft , so they summoned the us ' defense attache to discuss it . 
  that 's it . 
  interfax took it to another level , and added about flights being forced to divert at the last second , via an unnamed source . 
  the two are not the same . 
  1 is factual and can be verified . 
  the other can not be verified , and is from a media agency that has a history of promoting false information to promote a bias . 
  interfax cited an anonymous source in the russian air traffic authority . 
  forgive me for distrusting a news agency that tried to pass a poorly photoshopped ukranian fighter shooting down a completely different kind of jet , as proof of ukraine shooting down the malaysian airlines flight . 
  i do n't trust an anonymous source from a media agency that has a vivid history of pushing false information and down right lies in support of a particular government, 
   the russians are not going to attack europe [ today i learned ukraine is n't in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annexation_of_crimea_by_the_russian_federation )  or a nato country [ today i learned estonia is n't part of nato ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/07/russia-parades-detained-estonian-police-officer ) i 'm just an ignorant burger though , so i guess i need to learn some more, 
  to be fair , financial express ' entire source , is interfax , which , while it claims it is n't owned by the russian government , * was * created by moscow radio , which was 100 % owned and operated by the russian government . 
  not exactly an unbiased source to say the least . 
  the fact that literally no media not owned by the russian government is saying that , is pretty telling honestly . 
  interfax , rt , tass , sputniknews ... literally word for word the same text , while japan times , ny times , wapo , cnn , fox , abc , salon , rferl , usa today , time , etc all happen to exclude it . 
  not saying it 's not possible that that 's what happened , but when the only ones reporting that happen to be owned by the russian government , who has a history of blatantly manipulating their state owned media to push a certain narrative , it 's hard to trust . 
  ^ expecting the uk to track all those bombs they supplied years ago , when there was no ban on clusterbombs , is no different than expecting russia to track all the kalashnikovas with isis/farc/al qaeda/hezbollah/hamas / somali warlords/lra/etc etc etc, 
  icao standard 4.1.3.1.1  the emergency channel ( 121.5 mhz ) shall be used only for genuine emergency purposes , as broadly outlined in the following :  c ) to provide a common vhf communication channel between aircraft , either civil or military , and between such aircraft , and surface services , involved in common search and rescue operations , prior to changing when necessary to the appropriate frequency ; icao standard 5.2.2.1.1.1  aircraft on long over-water flights , or on flights over designated areas over which the carriage of an emergency locator transmitter ( elt ) is required , shall continuously guard the vhf emergency frequency 121.5 mhz , except for those periods when aircraft are carrying out communications on other vhf channels or when airborne equipment limitations or cockpit duties do not permit simultaneous guarding of two channels . 
  icao standard 5.2.2.1.1.2  aircraft shall continuously guard the vhf emergency frequency 121.5 mhz in areas or over routes where the possibility of interception of aircraft or other hazardous situations exist , and a requirement has been established by the appropriate authority . 
  icao standard 5.2.2.1.1.3  aeronautical stations shall maintain a continuous listening watch on vhf emergency channel 121.5 mhz during the hours of service of the units at which it is installed . 
  since the text of icao is ** clearly ** written , and does n't differentiate between military civil when it lists '' ** aircraft ** '' 5.2.2.1.1.2 alone is indisputable ... 
  but , not like i worked a military flight comms center or anything . 
  actually , in the case of the aegean sea , it 's greece that does n't recognize icao . 
  greece declares their national waters to 8 miles out , but their territorial airspace to 12 miles out . 
  while icao states your territorial airspace * can * extend to 12 miles out , it explicitly states it can not extend past your territorial waters . 
  so in the case of greece , their territorial airspace , should be only 8 miles , according to icao . 
  greece believes that because they set their territorial waters at 8 miles before icao existed , they should be exempt from that limitation , but the wording is clear as day . 
  turkey is a dick for constantly flying just outside 8 miles of greek islands knowing that greece claims 12 miles of airspace , but greece is actually the one in violation of un agreements , not turkey . 
   furthermore they 've shown no regard for the international civil aviation organization no regard for icao is why their su-24 pilot died when turkey shot down their fighter . 
  if russia actually respected icao , all of their aircraft would be able to monitor international frequencies as they 're by icao standards , ** mandated ** to . 
  but , russia does n't , so while commercial pilots in the region heard turkey make repeated call outs , the russian pilots heard none . 
  their own fault their pilot is dead , for being so arrogant that they disregard icao that they themselves helped set up . 
  estonia ? 
  poland ? 
  distintly remember all acting that way when crimea happened . 
  abusive spouse syndrome . 
  russia : `` hey babe , remember the good days ? 
  want to come back to me ? '', 
  eastern europe : `` no , you beat me before . 
  get away from me ! '', 
  russia : `` what did you say to me ?! '', 
  eastern europe : * grabs new bf/gf * russia : `` woah , what the fuck is this ? 
  why are you trying to threaten me for no good reason ?! '', 
  abuse someone for ( in this case over 50 years ) , and let them get away from you for even a little bit , and they 're going to run from you as fast as they can . 
  get upset , because you feel entitled to them , and then threatened that someone 's questioning your entitlement . 
  same reason putin stated in the past :  there are historians here , and people with their own views on our country 's history might argue with me , but i think that the russian and ukrainian peoples are practically one single people , no matter what others might say and  you do n't understand , george ( to george `` baby '' bush ) , that ukraine is not even a state . 
  what is ukraine ? 
  part of its territories is eastern europe , but the greater part is a gift from us . 
  they feel entitled to what they saw as theirs under the ussr era , and see them being friendly with the us/west as a threat to what they 're entitled to , and us/west offering friendship back is seen as threatening them to take what 's ( in their mind ) rightfully theirs . 
  same reason russia violated the budapest memorandum and caused everything in ukraine in the first place . 
  they were livid ukraine wanted to join the eu and not the eeu , because they ( putin at least ) feels ukraine is russia 's and should do what russia tells them to do . 
  when ukraine turned down their eeu offer , putin put sanctions on ukraine in an attempt to force them to do what he wanted , because ukraine is n't allowed to make sovereign decisions ( in his eyes ) . 
  that 's because the biggest members of the eu had good business with russia they did n't want to ruin . 
  france had a multi billion dollar deal for mistrals they did n't want to give up . 
  germany had a ** shit ton ** of trade with russia they did n't want to give up . 
  uk was caught between france/germany and the us , and kind of just waited it out to see . 
  everyone else was either `` eh , it 's not us , who cares '' or `` holy fucking shit it 's happening !, 
  mobilize everything and kiss our asses goodbye !!! '', 
  i mean , theoretically you can equip an sm-3 with a tactial nuclear warhead , but in order that to work : 1 . the arming system would have to be completely redesigned 2 . the missile would have to have its weight reduced in half to accomodate the weight of the warhead 3 . the missile would have to be doubled in size ( sm-3 diameter is just 34cm while the w88 nuclear warhead 's diameter is 55cm ) to accomodate the warhead 4 . 
  mk 41 vls cells would have to be completely redesigned to accomdate the enlarged missile so yeah , sm-3s * could * be equipped with nuclear missiles , much like how a submarine * could * be turned into an airplane . 
  both are technically feesable , the question is , why the fuck would anyone spend the quite possible hundreds of billions of dollars to make that work , when there 's already systems in place that are more effective than that ? 
  the idea that sm-3s will be converted to nuclear weapons is nothing more than a russian attempt to scare monger bmd capablities , because aegis ashore bmd makes the s400 's bmd capabilities look like a joke . 
  hey that 's me !, 
  italy 's fincantieri shipyard was approved to take 48 % control of france 's stx shipyard , in a move that 's being called the `` creation of a naval airbus '' . 
  fincantieri is the 4th largest shipyard in the world , while the stx shipyard is the only one in the eu capable of building a ship the size of an aircraft carrier ( uk has one that can , but ... ) . 
  this will imo , allow for the creation of a more unified naval force for the eu , and could quite possibly allow for the filling in of capability gaps that currently exist . 
  currently , if france wanted to build a large destroyer , they could n't . 
  between the development costs and limited procurement , its cost would simply be far too astronomically high for them to afford any . 
  however , what we saw in 2000 was france , italy , and the uk working together on a design , to keep costs manageable between the three of them . 
  obviously uk ended up bailing , and created the type 45 on their own , but france and italy stuck together , and created the horizon destroyer . 
  now imagine a shipyard for europe building a destroyer , where france , italy , germany , and spain are all purchasing from . 
  because the development costs are split across all of them , the ships are cheaper , and they can all actually afford to buy some . 
  that could give europe dozens of destroyers , heavyweight surface combatants , instead of the not quite a dozen it has currently . 
  we 've seen france and italy work extensively over the past decade or so for their navies , between the horizon and fremm . 
  hopefully this purchase adds more weight to their designs , and brings in more customers or even partners , to truly develop a naval airbus for european navies . 
  i honestly think it could seriously change the naval power dynamic for the eu as a whole . 
  no i know . 
  but his stop gap is only for a few rhinos , so the rest of the fleet of cf-18s are going to keep flying until a competition is held again , reviewed again , made a campaign issue again , and eventually ordered ... decades after the cf-18s should have been deemed unsafe to fly, 
  yes , but both also have their own 5th gen programs underway for replacing other aircraft . 
  both are replacing their f-4s with f-35s , but are making their own 5th gens to replace their f-15s in the future . 
  yeah canada should have been receiving their f-35s already , but that got turned into an election talking point , so now the cf-18s are going to stay in the air for probably decades to come :|,
