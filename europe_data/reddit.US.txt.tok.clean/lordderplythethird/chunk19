  way late to this , but germany needs a new fighter in 2025 to replace the tornados , while france needs nothing until they retire the rafales in the 2040-2050s . 
  every other tornado partner went for the f-35 , so germany 's on its own if it wants to make something . 
  they sat on their ass not doing a thing when the uk and italy were asking for a tornado replacement . 
  last year , germany went `` oh shit , we have less than a decade left in our tornados guys , we need to work on a replacement ! '' . 
  to which the uk and italy pointed to their f-35s , and said already done . 
  france is meanwhile going 100 % rafale , simply because it drops the overall price of them , making them easier to manage . 
  it 's very likely germany will be forced into procuring f-35s to replace their tornados , unless they jump in late on a south korean or japanese aerospace program, 
  * submarines * flight * bifocals * suspension bridge * coffee machine * morse code * electricity * solar electricity * telephone * assembly line that 's just off the top of my head . 
  europe 's created a lot , but what you said is honestly just as fucking ignorant , not to mention blatantly false , as the person you replied to . 
  us ** does ** buy european hardware though . . * uh-72 * hh-65 * c-27j * hk416 * hk417 * at4 * maaws * m119 * rsov * agm-119 * nsm * jsm etc etc the problem for europe was showcased with the future european fighter aircraft . 
  france , uk , germany , spain , & italy were working on a joint fighter program . 
  france needed it to be carrier capable . 
  everyone else told them to fuck off . 
  so , france fucked off , and made the rafale independently , while the rest created the eurofighter . 
  as it stands , europe is not a collective . 
  france needs something differently than germany , who needs something differently than the uk . 
  it causes them to seek outside means , like the c-17s the uk has . 
  no one in europe wanted to make a strategic transport with the uk , so they turned to someone who had one and was willing to sell it , the us . 
  italy wanted to replace their tornados and harriers . 
  no one wanted a joint program with them , so they turned to the us for the f-35b . 
  until europe federalizes , it will ** never ** have the means to make certain weapon systems the us does , because everyone 's needs are different , and no european nation can afford the costs of development of a comparable system on their own . 
  if europe federalized , then yeah , they 'd have more than enough to develop a european version of the c-17 . 
  but as is , germany believes the a440m is a valid replacement ( it 's not ) , and france has other procurement priorities , so a nation like the uk has to buy from the us in order to get what they want . 
  it 's as simple as that sadly . 
  what ** scenario ** do you need nato then ? 
  what ** scenario ** do you need a military then ? 
  what ** scenario ** do you need an eu military ? 
  the 214s * are * awesome , do n't fret !, 
  it 's just the 209-1000s that are , well , quite long in the tooth, 
  like the battleships that were there for more fluster and show than anything else ? 
  i was in the navy , i 'm a defense contractor now , and going off my post history , i 'm ( at least i like to think so ) pretty up to date on defense news . 
  you 're taking an extreme example , of which was used for show rather than actual force . 
  even if we disregard all of that , the elli modernization program was barely that . 
  they were updated with radars that were themselves already outdated , because those would fit , and because they did n't cost as much . 
  they were overall a * slight * improvement capability wise , over what the ship originally had , but * do * offer a greater reliability . 
  they added link-11 capabilities , which was already being replaced by link-16 . 
  they added gps . 
  they were upgraded to the thales lw08 long range air radar . 
  it came out in * 1990 * , and has been replaced already on a multitude of ships it was originally installed on . 
  this upgrade was done in the late 2000s , early 2010s ... 
  the last ship upgraded , literally got 25 + year old combat systems thrown on it , that were being phased out for other navies at the same time . 
  * actually * , when greece was * installing * these on their ships , canada was using their ships with them installed as live targets in sinkexs . 
  hmcs huron with its lw08 was sunk in a sinkex in 2007 , and canada is n't exactly the pinnacle of naval power ... 
  i 'm not saying the elli are museum ships , but simply that calling them modern , is ** far ** from the truth . 
  ehhhh weapons and combat systems * can * be upgraded in certain instances . 
  but the ship has to have the room for them , and they typically had to of been designed with that ship in mind . 
  you ca n't just take any naval radar system and throw it on any ship you want , especially something as small as a frigate . 
  it does n't work that way . 
  and in a lot of cases , modernizing to current standards can cost * more * than simply procuring a new ship with that same standard , because of everything that has to happen . 
  the exact same is true for fighter jets , just on a more extreme end of the scale . 
  that 's fair . 
  their navies are quite similar , with turkey being a bit larger and more modern , but very similar none the less . 
  air power is tipped towards turkey though , with over 200 f-16s , most being block 52s ( and those that are n't under modernization to become block 52s ) 120 f-35s on order , and tfx in the works . 
  even without the f-35 and tfx since they 're both future programs , the turkish air force has the clear edge in that realm . 
  ground armies are pretty similar as well , with turkey having the slight edge overall imo . 
  greece though has the massive lead in air defense though , which is a hard counter to turkey 's biggest strength . 
  any sort of credible combat capabilities ? 
  for example , when only 33 % of german fighter jets are usable at any given time , aerial refuelers mean those fighters can stay up in the air far longer than otherwise , which helps negate how few aircraft are in the air in general . 
  when the uk only has 19 combat ships , those unrep ships mean those combat ships can stay out on patrol for essentially indefinitely , otherwise they have to return to port every 3 months for fuel and food . 
  awacs grant fighter jets ** far ** more radar coverage . 
  a ef typhoon will only see a su-35 from roughly 120km away , while a modern awacs will see that same su-35 from over 250km away . 
  that means that ef typhoon can know exactly where the enemy is , and go straight towards them , instead of flying blindly trying to find it on its own , wasting gas ( again , no refuelers means that 's not possible ) . 
  when the uk owns literally 100 % of european strategic transports with 8 , any combat operation outside of france and germany is at a complete halt , waiting for the uk to shuttle europe 's armor to whatever front line there may be . 
  could ship those mbts by rail , but that 's just an easy target out in the open , and what happens when there 's no rail lines , like france saw with operation serval ? 
  no abm means there 's literally no defense against nuclear or even conventional ballistic missiles . 
  those nuclear missiles russia likely moved to kalingrad ? 
  yeah , there 's no no defense for berlin , or anywhere in europe for that matter , from them . 
  say goodbye to every major population center in europe in a single strike . 
  you may not understand what drives and runs a military , and that 's fine , but a military is completely useless without a logistics system to back it up . 
  it does n't matter if you have the largest tank force in the world , if it ca n't even move 150km . 
  europe ** needs ** those systems , just like every other military does , and they do n't have them . 
  us serves those roles for europe , and that 's fine . 
  we have the military budget to do so , and pilots need so many flight hours a year anyways , so serving that role for our allies is fine . 
  but to say those roles are n't needed , is just 100 % wrong . 
  til i 'm not greek , even though my great grandfather was , just because he fled the pontic genocide ... 
  * awacs * unrep * aerial refueling * strategic transport * any combat ship larger than a frigate * abm * equipment standardization * cas europe invests in tactical transports , frigates , fighter jets , tanks , apcs , & ifvs ; or the actual combat roles of a military . 
  but the overall logistics that gets those combat roles where they need to go , and support them once they 're there ? 
  that 's essentially non existent in all of europe . 
  * how many awacs are there in all of europe ? 
  you can count them on your hands . 
  * how many dedicated aerial refuelers are there in all of europe ? 
  you can count them on a single hand . 
  * how many unrep ships are there in europe ? 
  you can count them on your hands . 
  * how many strategic transports are there in europe ? 
  you can count them on a single hand ( a440m ca n't carry a mbt , and is thus , not a strategic transport , but rather an oversized tactical transport ) * how many destroyers are there in europe ? 
  you can count them on your hands . 
  * how much abm equipment is in europe that 's not us owned ? 
  * who literally writes the equipment and communications standards that all nato and fvey members use when building their own radios ? 
  us europe does n't need us military * combat * equipment , but it sure as ** hell ** needs its logistics . 
  ask france how operation serval even happened . 
  usaf strategic transports carried their armor for them , and usaf tankers refueled their tactical transports for them . 
  without those , even operation serval , a coin operation ( the lightest combat mission possible ) , would have been essentially impossible , and we 're talking about the french military , arguably the strongest on all of europe . 
  not really . 
  most of their ships are old ships other nations were retiring , like the elli class frigates , which were ships built in the 1970s for the netherlands . 
  most of their submarines * are * type 209s , but they 're the 1970s type 209s , and are n't exactly modern . 
  half their air force is mirage 2000s and f-4s , which are to say , old . 
  the other half is comprised of f-16s , with the bulk being block 30 f-16s , which came out in 1987 . 
  there are some block 52 + s ( came out in 2006 ) in greece , with * plans * to update a large bulk of the fleet to that standard , but with the economy how it is , that 's questionable at best . 
  it 's not highly outdated , like say romania 's reliance on 1950s era mig-21s , but it 's not very modern either .
