  if you 're using your gun in air to air combat today , you fucked up . 
  pierre feels in vision gun fights is the best way for air combat , because it `` keeps the pilot in the fight '' . 
  he still lives by an airforce doctrine that died in the skies over vietnam ( where all f-4s had a 3:1 kdr . 
  usaf f-4s focused on dog fighting with guns , improved to 5:1 . 
  navy f-4s focused on electronics and better missile use , improved to 13:1 . 
  no contest . ) . 
  yet , even today people think he 's credible ... how insane . 
  haha nice !, 
  buddy does it at acb for oni , i do it for dos . 
  pretty boring shit honestly, 
   `` government work '' that 's what i say haha . 
  i do n't feel like explaining what tier 2 network support is , so `` government work '' is my goto answer . 
  plottwist , i 'm not even a gs , i 'm a contractor hah, 
  hahah for my neighborhood , it 's almost ** all ** nsa people `` so what do you do ? '', 
  `` i 'm a deal with wiring and cable at meade '' `` ohhh you 're one of * those * guys '' `` uh , i guess ? 
  i 'm the guy who installs power outlets and lights and stuff '' '' ... oh ... '', 
  sounds exactly like my neighborhood actually hah . 
  yeah , my buddy stationed at acb loves the bah hah . 
  lives with me for cheap , and just rakes in dc area bah, 
  well , we have different opinions on the world i suppose , so i 'll leave it at we agree to disagree . 
  cheers !, 
  it 's not too much though . 
  almost no military in europe has the infrastructure to manage a conflict outside of their borders , let alone continent . 
  how many transport aircraft , refueling ships , air tankers , satellites would it take for germany to fight a conflict in even ukraine ? 
  likely a lot more than they have . 
  europe invested in their military , but have no infrastructure for it . 
  also , i dunno how medical works for european armies , but for the us , it 's under defense spending . 
  and the military gets paid quite well too . 
  4 years in as an e5 , and i was making $ 71k a year at 24 years old and no college . 
  that kind of personal income is n't cheap , and again , is also part of that spending . 
  we do !, 
  we spend ** a lot ** on our people actually ... it 's just our tax system is multilayered , and a lot of people only look at 1 layer and flip out . 
  but if you combine all the layers , it 's nowhere near what people and some media make it out to be . 
  not only are their federal taxes , but state and local taxes as well . 
  [ federal spending breakdown ] ( https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p3&amp;chs=600x200&amp;chco=cc0000,4040ff,00cc00,cc8800,66cc00,0088ff,00ff70,ffcc88,808080&amp;chf=bg,s,e8e8ff&amp;chd=t:26,27,4,22,10,1,2,1,1,6&amp;chl=pensions%2026% | health % 20care % 2027 % | education % 204 % | defense % 2022 % | welfare % 2010 % | protection % 201 % | transportation % 202 % | general % 20government % 201 % | other % 20spending % 201 % | interest % 206 % & chtt = federal % 20spending % 20for % 20united % 20states % 20 - % 20fy % 202015 ) [ state & local spending breakdown ] ( https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p3&amp;chs=600x200&amp;chco=cc0000,4040ff,00cc00,cc8800,66cc00,0088ff,00ff70,ffcc88,808080&amp;chf=bg,s,e8e8ff&amp;chd=t:9,22,27,0,7,8,8,3,12,3&amp;chl=pensions%209% | health % 20care % 2022 % | education % 2027 % | defense % 200 % | welfare % 207 % | protection % 208 % | transportation % 208 % | general % 20government % 203 % | other % 20spending % 2012 % | interest % 203 % & chtt = state % 20and % 20local % 20spending % 20for % 20united % 20states % 20 - % 20fy % 202015 ) state and local taxes/spending accounts for almost as much as federal spending , and they all have their certain responsibilities . 
  for example , the federal government is almost 100 % responsible for military spending , while the states and local governments are almost 100 % responsible for education/transportation . 
  this sounds really complicated , and it is ... but it goes back to the american revolution and american civil war . 
  basically , people did n't want people in just 1 area telling the rest of the nation what they needed to learn and such . 
  image if germany dictated to france what french students were to learn or vice versa . 
  so if you looked at * just * the federal spending , you 'd see 22 % towards defense , but only 4 % for education ... and be rightfully pissed off . 
  ** but !, 
  ** , if you looked at * just * state/local spending , you 'd see 27 % going to education and 0 % going to defense , and feel really proud of that . 
  when you combine all 3 , seen [ here ] ( https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p3&amp;chs=600x200&amp;chco=cc0000,4040ff,00cc00,cc8800,66cc00,0088ff,00ff70,ffcc88,808080&amp;chf=bg,s,e8e8ff&amp;chd=t:20,22,15,13,7,4,4,2,6,5&amp;chl=pensions%2020% | health % 20care % 2022 % | education % 2015 % | defense % 2013 % | welfare % 207 % | protection % 204 % | transportation % 204 % | general % 20government % 202 % | other % 20spending % 206 % | interest % 205 % & chtt = total % 20spending % 20for % 20united % 20states % 20 - % 20fy % 202015 ) , you 'll see over 50 % of all spending goes to education , health care , and welfare ( free food/housing/etc programs ) . 
  tl ; dr : us spending is a confusing numbers game , and almost no one reports it correctly , so the defense spending is n't actually * as bad * as it 's made out to be, 
  you do it the way the us ' military does it . 
  a base pay designated for each rank , and then a sort of bah ( basic allowance of housing ) which is based off the col ( cost of living ) for a certain geographical area . 
  for instance , while i was in the navy , i made ** way ** more money while i was in italy than i did when i was in virginia , but the cost of living in italy was way higher ... so it worked out . 
  though , that 'd probably only work if europe had multinational bases , instead of france having all french troops/germany having all german troops/poland having all the polish troops/etc . 
  so that way , a polish soldier would make more while in france than a french soldier would make while in poland , but their comfort of living would be equal . 
  they threaten to withold maple syrup from you too ? 
  those evil bastards ... 
  turkey is the new scapegoat for intellectually challenged who want to feel intellectually superior , so certain media goes with it for the $ $ . 
  easier to believe turkey 's waging a genocide against kurds , supports isis , and wants to usher in shariah law than it is to comprehend that the world 's not black and white , and situations are far more complex than they want them to be . 
  mention that not all kurds are good , or that turkey and iraqi kurdistan are fairly close and are openly fighting isis side by side in iraq and it gets showered in downvotes and calls of lies and propaganda , because people are fearful of a situation that 's more complex than they comprehend . 
  kurds have been useful to the us ... just , * iraqi * kurds . 
  syrian kurds have long supported , funded , sheltered , and armed the pkk , who are nothing more than a disgusting terrorist organization . 
  they 've never been close even to iraqi kurds , let alone the west . 
  honestly , i wish the us was n't working so closely with the ypg . 
  they 're no saints , and they 're committing numerous war crimes themselves , but no one wants to talk about that , because kurds = good , as if they 're 1 uniform group of people , not a multitude of groups , all with their own agendas . 
  a stronger ypg inevitably means a strong pkk . 
  the ypg 's governing body , the pyd , even call themselves the syrian pkk , they hold ocalan as their leader , and kongra-gel as their governing body . 
  one can say they 're independent , but it 's like if quebec claimed they were canadian , but declared manuel valls as their leader , and the french parliament as their governing body . 
  at that point , they 're french , simple as that . 
  a strong pkk means more deaths in turkey , and not just turkish deaths . 
  pkk will openly kill their fellow kurds for crimes as simple as selling bread to a turk . 
  plus , pyd and krg are in a power struggle . 
  right now , krg is arguably the more powerful of the two , but the more power the pyd gain , the more likely a 2nd kurdish civil war becomes , and with the rest of the region already ravaged by war , it 's going to be an absolute shit show . 
  by all means give them air support during battles with isis , but do n't arm them . 
  they 're supporters of a radical terrorist organization , and openly commit war crimes themselves . 
  not someone we should be providing arms to . 
  france literally ran out . 
  us went below the number in stockpile they like to have 24/7 , just in case . 
  completely different ... 
  the last nimrod was retired in 2010 ( they 've been retiring the fleet since 1992 ) . 
  uk held a bid in 2014 for a new platform , selected the p-8 as the replacement in 2015 , the first one is slated to be delivered in 2020 + , with the fleet going operational around 2022-2025 . 
  so 10 years to procure a replacement , and 12-15 years of no operational asw aircraft . 
  now they are , almost a decade after they retired the nimrod with no replacement even considered . 
  they 've only reconsidered procuring a replacement after russian submarines started showing up just outside their nuclear submarine base . 
  `` hey , we do n't need anti-submarine capabilities , lets retire the nimrod and not replace it '' `` holy shit there 's a submarine just over there !, 
  france/us/canada , help us !!! '', 
  `` yeah , i guess we * should * see about procuring some anti submarine aircraft . 
  we 'll buy 9 new aircraft to replace the ** 35 ** we had . 
  that sounds like it 'll be enough '' went from enough asw aircraft to patrol all the waters around the uk , to enough for a single squadron capable of patroling one certain area at a time . 
  even australia 's buying more , and while australia is far larger , their gdp and military budgets do n't even come close to the uk 's . 
  they 're also ** much ** further away from any possible hostile ports , making it far less likely for an enemy submarine to show up on their door steps, 
  i can personnally confirm this , as i was working at ctf-67 in sigonella , coordinating nato flights over libya at the time . 
  multiple nato members ran out of munitions during libya , france is not alone in that . 
  it 's not though . 
  uk has zero asw ( anti-submarine ) fleet . 
  an island , ca n't defend itself from submarines , the greatest threat to an island . 
  us/france/canada have to send asw aircraft to the uk to defend the uk from the biggest threat it faces . 
  france has near nonexistent refueling and heavy airlift capabilities . 
  operation serval , france 's coin ( counter insurgency ) operation in mali , mind you coin is the lightest combat operation there is , required ** extensive ** assistance from the usaf to refuel and even simply transport , french forces and equipment to mali . 
  yes , the a400m exists and france operates it . 
  the problem is , the a400m is ** always ** grounded for 1 issue or another , and when it 's not , it ca n't carry tanks . 
  france has no means of transporting tanks anywhere it ca n't drive them . 
  only the uk has this capability in europe sadly . 
  poland does n't seem to know what a navy is . 
  i respect poland on their work on their army and the work they 're doing now towards their air force , but their navy consists of literally ** 3 ** blue water surface vessels , 2 of which the us * gave * them after they retired them . 
  italy has arguably the most powerful non-nuclear military in europe , yet you would never guess it becuase they 're not given proper funding for maintenance , so vast numbers of their equipment are just there , waiting for depot level repairs they 'll likely never receive .
