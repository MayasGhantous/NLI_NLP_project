  and in at least 3 cases it was unquestionably assad 's forces , as chlorine was dropped via helos on residential communities , and we all know isis nor * western * - based rebels ( brits are there with them too ya know ) , have access to helicopters . 
  no , it 's really not . 
  every american should be aware that we have 3 branches of the federal government . 
  it 's one of the most basic principles of our free society for fucks sake ... * executive - president * legislative - congress * judiciary - court each branch serves as a check against another . 
  it is 100 % the judiciary 's job since the day of its creation , to serve as a check against the executive branch . 
  it 's part of the whole `` checks and balances '' thing our nation has ran off of since the 1700s you 're mandated to be taught in civics ... 
  if * any * of the branches has taken far too much power as of the past 50 years or so , it 's without a doubt the executive branch . 
  what 's right has virtually zero geopolitical relevance in the world though . 
  should i want to bring a nation like sweden more into the fold with military cooperation ? 
  absolutely . 
  am i going to pay the money that would be required for that ? 
  hell as no , sweden can fuck off for that cost . 
  what 's `` right '' , simply has very little influence in the world . 
  you 're going to have one hell of a bad time getting a high degree of interoperability between a nato member and non nato member . 
  it 's just so hard to do . 
  that non nato member is going to have to change out their communications systems on virtually everything they have , and that 's not cheap . 
  an an/prc -117 portable multiband radio for use in even just trucks for communications among themselves and their commanding unit , is roughly $ 10,000 usd . 
  for sweden , there 's 1000 tanks/apcs/ifvs alone . 
  not even counting all the rg-32s and such . 
  that 's $ 10,000,000 usd just for instant battlefield communications between sweden 's armor , and nato armor . 
  now do ships . 
  now do submarines . 
  now do aircraft . 
  now do infantry . 
  now do the rg-32s . 
  you 're looking at hundreds of millions of dollars ( usd ) to have that kind of seamless and instant communication on the battlefield . 
  it 's just not worth it . 
  it needs time , and to be done slowly . 
  granted , that 's what sweden at least , has been doing . 
  gripen 's meet nato standards for example . 
  but not everything in the swedish military does , and most equipment in non-nato militaries does n't . 
  it makes the most sense for it to be within nato honestly . 
  nato has a unified system already in place for interoperability that is unparalleled . 
  i 'm not just talking weapon systems , but communication systems as well . 
  when we design a communication system in the us , it has to be fvey compliant , or five eyes compliant ( australia , canada , new zealand , uk , us ) . 
  however , fvey is the same standard as nato . 
  so every system that gets designed , is capable of operating in unison with nato partners . 
  all they need is the correct cryptographic key , and there 's perfect communication across all mediums . 
  that does n't exist outside nato . 
  when nato does exercises with non-nato partners , communications equipment has to be loaned out to them , so they can communicate . 
  it works , but it 's not suitable outside of a training environment . 
  i 'm on a sub . 
  i talk to you on land . 
  you relay the message back to your sub . 
  instead , if you were a nato member , i could communicate directly with your sub . 
  so from that standpoint , it makes the most sense for it to be within nato to start with . 
  from there , maybe things will expand to include non nato eu members , but that 'll require a lot of changes on one end or the other . 
  source : i help develop fvey standards, 
  i do n't blame them , i just hope we 're able to recover from it when cheeto benito is gone ... 
  i 'm just looking at where we are already , after just 2 weeks , and i fear where relations are after 4 years , god forbid 8 ... 
  that 's a fact though , and they have their own alternate facts to go off of, 
   fetish world globalization fail trump 's about as anti-globalization as one can be ... 
  it 's one of the damn founding tenants of new-wave nationalism sweeping the uk , us , and now france ... 
  he was also pretty much shunned by the pentagon leadership for blaming basically all current issues on iran . 
  * isis ? 
  iran created them * problem in the middle east ? 
  iran did it * taliban attacked a us base ? 
  nah it was iran * iran nuclear deal ? 
  it 's bs , but at least it gives me their nuclear locations for airstrikes when it comes to war he 's a fine military ground commander general , but for leadership or operating without direct oversight ? 
  no fucking thanks . 
  him combined with michael flynn scare the absolute fuck out of me . 
  which the tornados are ... tornados are coded to allow the carry and deployment of up to 4 b61 nuclear free fall bombs ... 
  us stores , controls , and maintains the weapons . 
  germany , or any other nation hosting us nuclear weapons , have zero to do with them . 
  in the event of wwiii , the us can sign over control of the weapons to the host nation . 
  the idea is that if wwiii occurred , the npt has been voided anyways , so it 's no longer valid . 
  from there , germany or whatever the host nation may be , can load the bombs to their aircraft , and drop them on whatever targets may arise . 
  since they 're all gravity bombs , they 're not first strike capable , or even good for offensive strikes . 
  they 're pretty much ** only ** to take out invaders as they 're invading . 
  say there 's a horde of t-72s entering poland . 
  germany can load a b61 bomb to a tornado and eliminate that horde of t-72s . 
  you 're missing a few steps here 1 . occupy territory 2 . force deportations of the people who live there 3 . import native russians 4 . return territory and agree to respect the territorial rights of the nation under an international agreement ( budapest memorandum ) 5 . retake the territory under threat of force 6 . pretend steps 1-5 never happened, 
  https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/us/politics/in-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn-experience-meets-a-prickly-past.html  mr. flynn said that the first thing everyone needed to know was that he was always right . 
  his staff would know they were right , he said , when their views melded to his . 
   some also described him as a captain queeg-like character , paranoid that his staff members were undercutting him and credulous of conspiracy theories . 
   mr. flynn saw the benghazi attack in september 2012 as just one skirmish in this global war . 
  but it was his initial reaction to the event , immediately seeking evidence of an iranian role , that many saw as emblematic of a conspiratorial bent . 
   for weeks , he pushed analysts for evidence that the attack might have had a state sponsor -- sometimes shouting at them when they did n't come to the conclusions he wanted . 
  the attack , he told his analysts , was a `` black swan '' event that required more creative intelligence analysis to decipher . 
  https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/us/politics/michael-flynn-national-security-adviser-donald-trump.html  general flynn , for instance , has said that shariah , or islamic law , is spreading in the united states ( it is not ) . 
  his dubious assertions are so common that when he ran the defense intelligence agency , subordinates came up with a name for the phenomenon : they called them `` flynn facts . '', 
  he was also fired as head of the us ' defense intelligence agency when he was caught faking intelligence trying to blame iran for benghazi . 
  the people who worked for him , said he operated off what they called `` flynn facts '' that were only facts in his head , not in reality . 
   combined we also spend more on military than china ( 190 billion vs 140 bn ) , and three times as much as russia ( 65 bn ) . 
  is entirely useless figure to use though . 
  russian and us militaries are almost the exact same manning levels , but the us spends more on personnel alone than russia does on its entire military budget . 
  why ? 
  because $ to $ and $ to $ means literally nothing if you do n't account for cost of living differences . 
  i 'm american , and i sincerely apologize for the others in this thread acting like children , but ; * france 's operation serval in mali was nearly 100 % reliant on usaf tankers and transports to even get forces there . 
  * us took most of their frontline , brand new aim-9s , and * gave * them to the uk for the falklands war , which according to lord powell of bayswater , was the only reason the uk was able to win the conflict . 
  * uk and france were the main drivers behind nato intervention in libya , but were nearly 100 % reliant on us infrastructure for operation unified protector , even having to loan out weapons and engines due to simply running out . 
  * not a mission , but the only reason the uk is still even a nuclear power is because of the us literally * giving * them nuclear warhead blueprints , selling slbms to them , and * giving * them the designs for slbm tubes . 
  uk has n't made their own nuclear design since 1957 . 
  * right now , the us navy 's p-8 squadron deployed to scotland is the ** only ** long range dedicated asw option for the entire uk military , and they 're only there because the raf begged them for the assistance until the uk gets their p-8s and is competent with them , over a decade since they retired the nimrods . 
  nothing really for germany or italy though . 
  germany just does n't do anything militarily unless its a large scale international effort , and italy is the most powerful conventional military in europe and do n't operate too far from their own shores either . 
  but france and the uk have repeatedly gone to the us for assistance on operations , that much is 100 % true . 
  heck , us reserved one of its amphibious ships to * give * to the uk during the falklands in case the uk 's was sunk , because the uk would have lost the war without carrier air power . 
  no no i fully understand , it 's just there 's ** so ** many warships for example , that could ** greatly ** benefit from lasers , that already have plenty of power for them without serious modifications to their power systems, 
  you do n't even need all of that .
