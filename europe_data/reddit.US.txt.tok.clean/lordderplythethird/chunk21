  laws that the us navy uses requires 30kw a shot to disable a small boat 's engine . 
  larger ships , even non nuclear , put out insane amounts of power . 
  type 45s put out 47000kw of power . 
  type 26s are going to put out roughly 30000kw of power . 
  zumwalts put out 78000kw of power . 
  arleigh burkes put out 78000kw of power . 
  f125s put out 30000kw of power . 
  even the braunschweig corvette puts out 15000kw of power . 
  virtually every ship built in the mid 80s or sooner , has a massive amount of excess power that was set aside for planned future upgrades ( like lasers ) . 
  that 's not even remotely true ... laws for example , only needs 30kw to detonate an rpg warhead , or cut through a small vessel 's engine . 
  takes roughly a 1-2 second burst to cut though a small boat 's engine , disabling it . 
  a type 45 destroyer for example , puts out 47000kw of constant power . 
  you can run the type 45 at max engine power , shooting 2 laws , and still have over 6000kw of power for anything you want . 
  plus , there 's nothing explosive to store aboard your ship with a laser . 
  you * really * want to carry around thousands upon thousands of shells containing he for your close in weapon system ( ciws ) onboard your ship , that can cook off and sink you in the event of an uncontrolled fire ? 
  no thanks . 
  give me laws that ca n't cook off , that also has unlimited ammo, 
  but there was still an extremely noticable difference in the russian government from 2008-2012 , which was medvedev 's presidency . 
  shit , it saw eastern nato members suggesting to invite russia into nato , that 's how warm relations were . 
  about a decade ago russia looked positive because putin was n't the president , medvedev was . 
   the russians have their only usable warm water port in sevastopol they had just renewed the lease in 2010 , granting them ownership of the base until 2042 , with the option for indefinite 5 year extensions . 
  there was zero threat to them of losing their port , without ** serious ** grounds for legal and/or military escalation  the one in syria fell to the war the one in syria did n't exist . 
  i mean it did , but there 's 0 usable docks , and all of 12 people stationed there . 
  it exists on paper , and to be one of russia 's only foreign bases , but in terms of capabilities , it did n't exist . 
   but at least we might dismiss the ` needlessly belligerent ' characterisation that is being put forward by anti-russia propaganda i think threatening to nuke almost every nation from estonia to denmark should count as belligerent , do n't you ? 
  because that 's exactly what the putin administration has done . 
  russian mod has literally threatened nuclear strikes on : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2566005/russia-threatens-nuclear-attack-on-poland-over-us-missile-shield-deal.html http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-threatens-to-use-nuclear-force-over-crimea-and-the-baltic-states-10150565.html http://www.newsweek.com/russia-targets-danish-warships-nuclear-weapons-315928 this is par the course for a belligerent dictator like kim jong un of north korea , but this is in fact , the russian government we 're talking about . 
  nevermind the kidnapping of a nato intelligence officer from within a nato country ... http://www.wsj.com/articles/estonian-officer-abducted-near-border-with-russia-1409928475 this is n't anti-russian propaganda , it 's simple facts , nothing more , nothing less, 
  awesome map , it just sucks the legend changes for every one . 
  really skews the results if you 're just skimming it . 
  need to have 82 % or above to be dark blue for view of the eu , but only 44 % to be dark blue for view of russia . 
  if the legend for russia was the same as the one for the eu , there 'd be no dark blue at all ... 
  should n't it just be an even 0-25 26-50 51-75 76-100 for every map ? 
  fair number of those too , but every time there 's an incident at the shill farm , / r/worldnews ' heavy pro-russia user base is seemingly absent , without fail . 
  watch it the next time there 's an incident . 
  like night and day . 
  probably because / r/worldnews is a hivemind mixture of / r/conspiracy and russian shills . 
  do n't expect too much free intellectual thoughts over there , unless the st petersburg shill farm is closed for the day, 
  allah akbar is a typical arabic and muslim saying , equivalent to a westerner saying something `` oh my god ! '', 
  i 'm sure you 've said `` oh my god '' plenty of times in your life . 
  are you making a religious statement by saying that , or is it simply a common expression ? 
  was n't a bodyguard , but rather just used a police id to get in . 
  possibly police , possibly stolen id . 
  could have friends/family in aleppo . 
  could be related to the turkmen who russia and assad have bombed non stop . 
  nuclear capable iskanders are prohibited from kalingrad under the inf treaty signed , yet nuclear capable iskanders are what 's being moved to kalingrad . 
  as does russia . 
  not exactly rocket science , so what part is stressing your little mind about ? 
  yeah , it does n't list the estonian military forces in estonia anymore than it does the russian military forces in the eastern sectors or kalingrad . 
  what the ever living fuck is your point , or do you not even have one besides idiotic ranting ? 
  why bother with that ? 
  slap polish flags to their t-72s and they 'll look exactly like ... polish t-72s . 
  yup , romanian spec 'd ah-1zs . 
  easy choice there honestly . 
  only way it would have been a hard decision is if sikorsky offered daps for the same cost as the ah-1z , which would never happen . 
  for attack helos ? 
  airbus was the single worst bid of the 3 ... bell was the best entry , followed by sikorsky , followed dead last by airbus . 
  bell 's entry is ... well , an attack helicopter . 
  that gives it the auto leg over the other 2 from the get go ... sikorsky 's s-70 at least has an attack version , known as the [ dap ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/34/c5/bf/34c5bf65d0dfd7036b405e630056b2ce--military-police-military-aircraft.jpg ) . 
  airbus was the worst by quite a margin , as there 's not even an armed version of the h215 . 
  rand is very much like mcconnell though , it just depends on the day of the week ... 
  he heavily panders to who his audience is at the time , so you can paint him as anything from a radical teaparty member , all the way to a liberal . 
  he 's everywhere from `` militarization of the police is absolutely unacceptable . 
  weapons of war have no business being in police hands '' to `` i do n't care if someone simply robbed a liquor store . 
  if a drone can put them down without risking police lives , i want them to have it '' . 
  by hosting editorials , like virtually all news organizations do ? 
  the fact that you ca n't tell what an editorial is , and use editorials as your basis that a news organization sucks , is the real issue here ... 
  ^ this is a serious issue . 
  people can not fucking differentiate editorials from news articles , and read shit editorials and thinks that means everything from them is shit . 
  buzzfeed is a prime example , with their `` tell how good you are at sex by which kind of taco you like '' junk , but their * news * section , is a literal pullizer prize winning organization , with some of the most respected journalists in the world on salary . 
  i lived in southern italy for 4 years , and seemingly virtually everyone i met south of rome , was anti-eu . 
  on sicily , i do n't really think there 's a single eu supporter ... all it will take in my ignorant opinion , is the trend in northern and central italy to continue , before there 's an italian exit from the euro . 
  i think it may eventually surpass the f-16 program in the number of countries that end up operating them , but i ca n't see it surpassing the f-16 program in sheer numbers . 
  the world 's not as unsteady ( contrary to front page news and 24 hour media ) as it was when the f-16s came about , and people just are not spending as much $ $ ( corrected for inflation ) as they were back then . 
  there 's been around 4600 f-16s built , and that number could drastically increase , depending on the winner of the made in india program . 
  there 's only 3200 + / - f-35s ordered or planned right now . 
  there will obviously be more that eventually get ordered , but 1400 more ? 
  i just do n't see it . 
  romania is still looking at f-35s , as is poland , which is why they both bought only a small number of second hand f-16 mlus . 
  look , he said , and i quote :  they invest a lot of money into the military while almost completely ignoring healthcare . 
  which i pointed out is 100 % false . 
  hell , us * government * spends $ 5000usd a person on healthcare to france 's $ 2250usd a person . 
  the only thing that shows , is how little funding the french military gets ... you can twist it however you want , for whatever bias you want , but facts are facts ... 
  a lot of them irrationally do sadly . 
  hating and blaming iran for giving iraqi insurgents efps that killed hundreds of coalition fighters is rational . 
  faking intelligence and trying to goad iran into attacking first , is just irrational . 
  and flynn , and mattis . 
  4 stars under obama wanted the world to do what * they * told it to do , regardless of what the chain of command said , and no matter how dangerous what they wanted was . 
  people seem to forget that mattis got canned for literally ** screaming ** at the national security director , when both the pentagon and white house denied him a 3rd carrier in the persian gulf , which he wanted there simply to egg on iran into attacking us forces . 
  or that flynn was fired for calling his superiors and the white house and state department incompetent for not understanding that benghazi was an iranian attack , even though there were no links that tied it to iran . 
   they invest a lot of money into the military while almost completely ignoring healthcare . 
  what in the blue hell is this bullshit ? 
  what is the largest budget item of the federal goverment ? 
  it 's not the military . 
  it 's not federal pensions . 
  it 's * healthcare * , and to the tune of $ 1.15 ** trillion ** dollars a year vs the combined military/intelligence allotment of $ 830 billion dollars a year . 
  nevermind that when you add in state and local spending , the us government 's contributions to healthcare is over $ 1.6 trillion dollars a year , ** double ** the military and intelligence community 's budget ... 
  us government in ** zero ** way `` almost completely ignores '' healthcare . 
  that is straight up false . 
  the us ' problem is that it inefficiently spends money on healthcare , and nothing more than that .
