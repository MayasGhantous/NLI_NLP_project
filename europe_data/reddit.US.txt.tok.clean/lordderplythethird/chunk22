  false . 
  eurofighter consortium refuses to give their source code to the us , which the us ** requires ** in order to validate the aircraft for deployment of b61 bombs . 
  as such , the eurofighter will ** never ** be capable of fulfilling nato nuclear sharing obligations . 
  it 's why germany is now looking at buying f-35s to replace the tornados ... 
  what 's the fms ( foreign military sales - airframe , training , maintenance , spare parts , planned upgrades ) of the rafale ? 
  what 's the fms of the typhoon ? 
  what 's the fms of the f-35 ? 
  want to take guesses ? 
  typhoon fms : ** $ 320m usd ** - [ source ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/2016/04/05/kuwait-signs-eurofighter-deal/82647386/ ) rafale fms : ** $ 245m usd ** - [ source ] ( http://www.janes.com/article/64054/india-finally-signs-deal-with-france-for-36-rafale-fighters ) f-35 fms : ** 186m usd ** - [ source ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-23/australia-to-buy-58-more-joint-strike-fighters/5405236 ) who knew ordering and operating an aircraft with not even 500 planned is more expensive than ordering and operating an aircraft with over 3000 planned ... 
  please tell me more about how the rafale is cheaper than the f-35 . 
  i 'm interested ... 
  typhoons are not replacing the tornado in the uk , f-35bs are replacing the tornado in the uk ... typhoons will be the uk 's air defense platform , and the f-35s will serve as their ground attack/isr/sead platform , just like the tornado before it . 
  you had them too , and then said `` nevermind we do n't want them '', 
  not even remotely close to that capability ... only time it 's ever been done was when it was a simulation hooked up to a super computer the size of a warehouse . 
  tech has strunk alot over recent years , but it 's slowed down quite a bit since then ... 
  optionally manned . 
  for bombing an undefended target , you can operate it remotely . 
  for combat air patrols , you 'll need it manned . 
  drones are no where near that complex , and wo n't be for a loooong time . 
  the time keeps increasing the more advanced aircraft get . 
  3rd gens look 4 years , give or take . 
  4th gens took 6-8 years , give or take . 
  4.5 and 5th gens took 18-22 years , give or take . 
  6th gens could very well take 25 + years , depending on how long it takes tech to mature and how much tech will be thrown into them . 
  curious to if france will drop out again if germany again refuses to cooperate on building a carrier variant , like we saw with the eurofighter program ... 
   i think you underestimate the risks at stake with an arrest at sea of people who do not want to be arrested , especially entering a military site as former navy , you 're ** radically ** overhyping the threat faced by boarding a ** known unarmed ship ** ( the difference between boarding a green peace vessel , and boarding a gaza flotilla ship ) , in order to cement your bias . 
  he wears extremely loose fitting clothes to try and hide his weight, 
  could be worse , could be kip ward ... 
   and that 's why the us is constantly building so much armament also because what you have already built day 1 of a major war today , is all you 're going to have . 
  in a war with russia or china , all military production facilities are going to get hit instantly . 
  they 're not going to allow m1a2s to keep rolling off the plant . 
  we actually carry beer on us ships . 
  if you 're out at sea for x days straight ( i forget how many ) , we have what we call a `` steel beach picnic '' , where they bust out beer and we drink and grill to boost morale, 
   general opinion question like this in a peaceful period makes no sense whatsoever and creating a blatantly false rhetoric of an entire 's regions ' views of western european hardware , because of like 3 trolls in / r/europe does ? 
  do you not at all see the hypocrisy in your statement just now ? 
   do you think they would be in the same state of mind than in spring 2015 when the study was conducted ? 
  when they were planning their summer holiday ? 
  after russia violated the budapest memorandum and invaded a former warsaw pact nation ? 
  when germany was pressing ** hard ** to reduce sanctions on russia , effectively letting russia do what it wanted to a former vassal state ? 
  no , i do n't think it 's acceptable in the eyes of a lot of the eastern european citizens i 've met and interacted with . 
  it 's viewed as complicit appeasement of a nation that threatens their national security on a monthly basis ...  quick reminder they ca n't even succeed in dombass and have a gdp smaller than italy 's quick reminder that they 're barely trying in donbass . 
  there 's estimated to be roughly 5000 russian forces in donbass . 
  in comparision russian snap military exercises next to estonia , typically include over 100,000 troops , and are launched with virtually zero notice . 
  gdp is also 100 % meaningless when they already have the military hardware they need , and have tens of thousands of pieces of more hardware in reserves , just waiting . 
   eastern european states are getting 170 billion from 2014 to 2020 alone in eu funds to develop economic sectors and build infrastructures ** economic ** aid , and simply because it serves the eu 's interest . 
  a stronger economy in those nations , means the eu has a stronger economy , and the euro 's value can rise . 
  do n't act like it 's for any purpose other than that ...  they are part of the largest military alliance ever created and are guaranteed protection by nato and the eu and we 're back to that poll , and the overwhelming view of western europeans as a whole that they can go fuck themselves if they 're invaded , on top of witnessing germany openly engaging in appeasement of russia for doing to ukraine exactly what it nearly monthly threatens to do to them . 
  i do n't fucking grasp how germans and the french ca n't fucking grasp this idea of how other nations would be pissed at them ... 
  it 's clear as fucking day why one would ... 
  that 's isolated instances of moronic trolls on a website ... 
  it 's in no way an indicator of the entire populations ' view . 
  even then , is it hard to understand why a polish person may not want german hardware for a political reason ? 
  it 's not like 60 % of german and 53 % of french citizens recently stated they believe their nations ** should not ** come to the aid of a eastern nato member if they come under attack from russia . 
  i mean , that 's the biggest middle finger in the world to them , and then germans and french wonder why * some * select individuals from those nations are pissed off at france and germany ... no shit there 's pissed off individuals . 
  they joined nato for protection , and their neighbor allies overwhelmingly say , they have no desire to protect them , while their far away ally overwhelmingly says they ** would ** protect them . 
  but still the french and germans do n't comprehend why eastern europeans are sometimes hostile to them ? 
  [ this bullshit , is exactly why ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/06/russia-ukraine-report-46.png ) . 
  you 're viewing them ( in their eyes , and my independent eyes ) as sacrificial lamb , not allies . 
   i was talking about some ee who constantly dismiss whats comes from we like what ? 
  have you ** looked ** to see what ee militaries are using ? 
  estonia 's army is almost 100 % eu hardware . 
  their navy is 100 % eu . 
  their air force is almost 100 % pre-ussr soviet . 
  polish army is an almost perfect thirds mix of eu , polish , and pre-ussr soviet hardware . 
  their navy is a mix of pre-ussr soviet , eu , and us that 's been donated . 
  their air force is largely pre-ussr soviet hardware , but they 're getting a ton of second hand aircraft from the us for cheap . 
  these are not isolated cases . 
  ee ** does not ** constantly dismiss products from we . 
  they * do * however constantly take dirt cheap second hand or free products from the us over full price products from we though . 
  but for a nation like poland who 's trying to rapidly modernize as fast as they can , do you * really * expect them to pay full price for a rafale or eurofighter , when they can get f-16s for essentially free ? 
  yeah , the f-16s are older and will need to be replaced sooner , but it gave them something for the time being without breaking the bank . 
  the problem is that we defense industries have largely been absolutely ** horrid ** at picking up bigger item orders in ee countries , because it 's either the latest and greatest tech for high costs , or nothing at all . 
  would poland love to have rafales or eurofighters ? 
  i 'm sure they would . 
  do they have the funds to drop $ 220-270m per aircraft on them ? 
  no , so there 's no no offer valid to them from we . 
  simple as that . 
   seriously , your speculations are fairly worthless . 
  pot , meet the god damn kettle ... wow, 
  i mean how literally zero programs have been officially started or funded ... you know , the internationally recognized beginning of a program ? 
  yeah that thing ...  they will have to why ? 
  there 's plenty of options for spain without them spending a dime in r&d ... gripen , eurofighter , rafale , f-35 , f/a -18 e. . . all available options for them . 
  they do n't have to drop a god damn dime on anything except airframes ... 
  f-16s have ** never ** been air superiority aircraft . 
  they were originally designed for it , but they changed their minds and went multirole . 
  it has been a multirole since the day it rolled into ioc . 
  air superiority , cap , cas , sead , isr ... the combination of those , is quite literally the reason for the name , because it 's a aircraft that can do ... ** multi ** ple ** role ** s. 
  france is 100 % on the rafale . 
  they have to be , in order for it to be competative . 
  spain ca n't even afford to replace their hornets after how out of control the eurofighter ended up . 
  the big 3 funded the eurofighter with help from spain , because , quite frankly , they 're the only ones who matter when it comes to having money to spend . 
  they 're the only ones who are going to front money on a a tornado replacement , so they kind of ** do ** have to , if they want one of their own . 
  uk said no . 
  italy said no . 
  the only other operator of it is saudi arabia , and they 'll never put in money for r&d , they never have before so why would they now ? 
  they 'll just wait for the next shiny object to come along and buy a handful of them . 
  rafale is n't airbus , it 's dassault . 
  germany wants airbus to work with france on a new joint nation plane that 'll be ready in 2040-2050 ( like the eurofighter and rafale 's replacement ) you 're confused who makes the rafale , and you 're confusing a procurement plan for 30-40 years in the future , for a procurement program of today ... 
  i do n't disagree , but germany 's much like canada in the fact that they do some seriously backwards defense procurement against the wishes of their military , all in the name of politics ... 
  airbus is n't really sure what the fcas is going to be .
