  sometimes they say tornado replacement , sometimes they say typhoon ( eurofighter ) replacement . 
  they have no clue what the hell it 's going to be , they 're just trying to spur interest in it . 
  imo it 'll be a typhoon & rafale replacement , but only really make it to the market until 2045 or 2050 . 
  it 's 20 + years from the date a program starts before an aircraft goes ioc these days , and there 's no program started , nor does there appear to be one anytime soon . 
  that 's why i think it 'll end up as a rafale-eurofighter replacement . 
  both will be damn near 50 years old by 2050 , and well overdue for a replacement . 
  germany ca n't afford a tornado replacement program on their own . 
  eurofighter program for instance , costed $ 42b . 
  germany ca n't afford that ... 
  there 's a reason the uk carried damn near 40 % of the eurofighter program cost all on their own . 
  i would think in that case , the eurofighter being coded for more weapons and increased procurement of them would rank ** far ** higher than the rafale . 
  likelyhood of occuring from most to least 1 . buy f-35s 2 . add more capabilities to eurofighter and buy more 3 . fingers in ear saying `` lalala '' 4 . ? 
  7 . buy rafales buying rafales is possibly the single ** worst ** thing that germany can do , when the rafale is the eurofighter 's only competitor for limited sales to nations looking for the most advanced fighter they can get who are n't allowed to buy f-35s . 
  that 's just willfully shooting themselves , and the eurofighter , in the foot . 
  they 're almost more likely to buy mig-35s from russia than rafales from france ... 
  that 's true , though the eurofighter can have b61 capabilities added to it . 
  it 'll require money to be thrown at it , and coders a while to add the coding for the b61 added to the eurofighter , but it 's absolutely possible . 
  germany would have to pay for that on their own though , and probably share classified systems information off the eurofighter with the us like the uk did on the tornado back when it got b61 capabilities , so probably unlikely at best that ever happens . 
   they could focus on expanding the eurofighters arsenal and procure more eurofighters , or add rafale 's to their arsenal , but the f-35 is the best and cheapest option . 
  you kind of answered why they 're going the f-35 route yourself :p  though i wonder if , given the current material/financial problems in the german army , having 2 platforms is still desirable . 
  if they were continuing their historical route of not spending money you 'd be right , but they * did * agree to the 2014 wales conference mandate of 2 % by 2024 and at least 20 % of it on new hardware , so that money has to go somewhere right ? 
   might as well just expand the ef fleet ef fleet is awesome , but there 's some roles it 's just not really suited for . 
  it * can * do them , but not as well as others . 
  specifically isr and sead come to mind , which were 2 big roles for the tornado . 
  there 's also germany 's real lack of an awacs/aewc fleet , which the f-35s * can * serve as as well . 
  so they 'd get better isr and sead capabilities , while also granting better capabilities to their ef fleet at the same time . 
   another alternative is a significant overhaul , lots of tornado 's will be for sale in the next years from italy/uk , they could just upgrade and make a fleet wide restoration attempt , buying the old batches from uk/italy , restore/upgrade the best specimens and use the others for parts/training . 
  definitely possible , but i would think both uk and italy are going to decomm on a tornado by tornado case , starting with the ones closest to their 6000 flight hour limit . 
  germany could slep them for another 2000 flight hours , but you 're talking about spending money on an aircraft , to spend money on that aircraft , to use it for just 10 years . 
  for poorer nations with no real credible or modern air force , that can be an option , but i just do n't see germany going that route . 
  the tornados would need brand new off the production line wings , like what a-10s are getting , in order to have more than your standard slep life extension , but again , that 's still even * more * money . 
  also worth noting that the uk 's tornados are largely a different variant than what germany uses . 
  needs to happen ** far ** sooner than that . 
  tornado fleet is already at its 6000 flight hour limit . 
  even with slep , you 're only giving the fleet another 2000 flight hours , and since the german air force averages 200 flight hours a year on their combat aircraft , that 's 10 more years of operation . 
  tornados ** need ** to be replaced before 2030 , or german pilots are going to end up dead , simple as that . 
   that 's what it comes down to : have to buy us weapons to try and mollify god 's greatest deal-maker . 
  more so that the german government is stupid , and waited until just before they started retiring their tornadoes to go : `` oh shit , we need a replacement for this !, 
  hey uk , hey italy , you guys wan na work on a tornado replacement program like we did for the eurofighter ? '', 
  after the uk and italy have * long * stated they 're replacing their tornados with the f-35 , and have no desire on investing on a 3rd combat airframe for their militaries . 
  so now germany has no replacement for the tornado , and there 's no one willing to invest in designing a replacement alongside them , so they 're pretty much stuck going the same route as the uk and italy ; replace the tornados with f-35s . 
  maybe if german defense procurement was n't so mind bogglingly moronic on par with canada , they could have had other options available to them . 
  but , that 's not the german armed forces ' way , so here we are . 
   let 's hope they stay in the air longer than the lockheed starfighters yes , lets hope germany does n't take an interceptor and claim it 's a heavy bomber and try to use it as such . 
  ca n't really fault lockheed for germany losing over 30 % of their f-104s when germany was the idiot who overburdened the airframes . 
  that 's like being upset a boeing when your f-15 crashes after you tried to use it as a cargo aircraft ... also not really lockheed 's fault a vast number of german pilots lost via the f-104 , were due to the pilots literally flying their aircraft into hills because they did n't know how to fly properly . 
  i ca n't really blame bmw if i buy my 5 year old daughter whose never driven one and she drives it into a store ... 
  and then the us should do the same , since france alone is the world 's 2nd largest source of industrial espionage and sabotage , with the overwhelming majority of its attacks aimed at us industries directly competing with theirs . 
  you 're a blind fucking fool throwing stones in a glass house if you think eu nations do n't do the same god damn thing . 
  ^ which every country does , sadly . 
  look at germany right now with vw . 
  look at canada right now with bombardier . 
  every nation does it , sadly . 
  not a problem . 
  i spend too much time for my own good watching military procurement and such , only reason i know that lol, 
  neuron and the taranis are being wrapped up into the foas ( future offensive air system ) , for a singular european ucav . 
   did n't france used to have a ` french only ' policy for military stuff ? 
  i mean , france was part of the eurofighter program , and only dropped out when everyone else refused to design a carrier version of it ... 
  they have a ucav program with the uk . 
  they have a tank program with germany . 
  it 's not a `` french only '' policy , but more so a `` french as much as possible '' policy . 
  yeah , it takes days on end to mobilize troops , no matter what nation you are, 
   the c variant is almost 6000 pounds heavier it has a bigger wing span and can carry 1500 pounds less fuel than the a variant wow ... way untrue . 
  please stop making up figures , when the numbers are readily available online ... | platform | empty weight | internal fuel | | : -- | : -- | : -- | f-35a | 13,200 kg | 8,400 kg f-35c | 15,800 kg | 8,900 kg also , the f-35c has a far greater surface area , which allows for more lift , granting it further ranges than otherwise , at the expense of weight and g limits . 
  simply put , ** stop ** making up your own numbers . 
   the threat to the tankers exists from the moment that both russia and china developed pak fa and j20 pak-fa is n't in service , and only 12 are on order . 
  it 's not a threat to tankers . 
  stop saying it is . 
  j-20 are still in limited testing , and it 'll be years before they 're procured in any meaningful numbers . 
  they are ** not ** threats to tankers today , as i 've tried to make clear to you . 
  that is simply a lie , straight up . 
   what you mean shtorm goes by many names ? 
  i mean literally that ? 
  they keep taking their super carrier design from decades past , and slightly tweaking it to make it even more grand ? 
  what 's confusing about that wording ? 
   actually they have built quite a lot of stuff since 2009 yes , but nothing that size . 
  the largest ships built by russia since the end of the soviet union have been 3 frigates . 
  there 's been dozens of corvettes built , but any shipyard on earth can built a corvette . 
  there 's a massive difference in being able to build a corvette , and being able to build a 90,000 ton carrier . 
  this is the whole reason russia needed to order mistrals from france , because they do n't have a shipyard that can build ships that size on their own ... 
  it 's why russia 's still using a destroyer built in the ** 1960s ** , because they ca n't build a ship to replace it . 
  stick to facts please . 
   the maximum radius on ferry is 1110 km on the c variant the maximum on a typical payload is 833km on the b variant a is just retarded version so no one cares about that ** all ** of that , is false , and honestly , i have no idea where you 're coming up with these numbers ... | platform | combat range | ferry range | | : -- | : -- | : -- | f-35a | 625nmi/1200km | 1200nmi/2220km f-35b | 470nmi/865km | 900nmi/1670km f-35c | 630nmi/1200km | 1200nmi/2220km that 's for full load combat range . 
  carrying 2 2000lb bombs and 2 aim-120s internally , the combat radius for the f-35a is 625nmi/1200km , and carrying 4 aim-120s internally , the combat radius for the f-35a is 750nmi/1400km . 
  the new power module increases the a2g radius to 660nmi/1250km , and the a2a radius to 800nmi/1500km , thanks to it 's 6 % better fuel consumption . 
  that means f-35cs ( which have slightly more range than the f-35as , but we 'll say it 's the same ) on air patrol , can go out as far as 1500km on their own internal fuel , while still making it to the carrier on their own . 
  a cbars could hold at 1000km away from the carrier , and constantly top off f-35cs on a cap mission , while still staying some 600km away from the closest k-100 / r-37 launch point ... 
  the threat to tankers is absolutely ** not ** today . 
  it 's not tomorrow . 
  it 's not even 10 years from now . 
  yes , the usaf needs to start looking at stealth tankers , but for a decade + down the road ...  yeah but as i said when you give one team a big advantage of having an awacs while the reds gets cgi both sides had awacs ... at one point , the f-35s were forced to serve as blue force 's awacs ... plus , red side had counter air batteries all over the floor providing them targeting as well . 
   china refers to j20 as a bomber helps that the proposed armament is 90 % air to surface missiles and some conventional bombs and only 2 short to mid distance ata missiles no they do n't ? 
  they call it a fighter bomber , which is another term for a multirole aircraft . 
  literally the only armament for it right now , are the pl-10 wvr missile , and pl-12 bvr missile . 
  there 's literally ** no ** a2g capabilities to it as of right now ... fanbois have given it every weapon in the book , but fanbois are stupid as hell . 
  as per the plaaf , just pl-10s and pl-12s . 
  other weapons will be added down the road , but that 's it for now . 
   pak da wasnt even a russian desing it was a fan made video as for shtorm pretty sure it came on 2011 pak-da is an official ruaf r&d program ... shtorm has gone by many names . 
  in 1975 it was called project 1153 . 
  in 1985 it was called ulyanovsk .
