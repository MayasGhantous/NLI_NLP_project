  now it 's called shtorm , or officially project 23000e . 
  any name you give it , it 's virtually impossible for russia to make , when the largest warship they 've built since the soviet union era , are ** 3 ** lone frigates . 
  they do n't have a shipyard that can build destroyers or cruisers , let alone a 90,000 ton carrier . 
  it 's all rhetoric and propaganda . 
   f35 and f22 have a combat radius of 600 max not 1200 1200km + combat radius ( around 1300km technically , with about to be boosted to around 1450km , for the f-35 at least ) , 2200km ferry range . 
  i 'm fairly certain you 're mistaking nmi for km . 
   they still havent provide a single statement on what was the role of the f22s in that said scenario that is why i never trust anything that comes from the mouth of people involved in politics that 's fair enough , though they * did * release the squadrons present . 
  only f-22 squadron was the 27th squadron , while 3 f-35a squadrons were sent . 
  does n't tell us how well each did , but 16 vs 48 helps paint the picture , at least a little . 
   kc-z isnt due to mid/late 30s which is fine , because kc-46s are n't really threatened before then ...  cbars since the mil c is keep delaying ( now on 2019 than 2017 ) i really really really doubt we will see it before 2025 . . dev contracts were already issued , with fly off this fall , and a contract awarding next year . 
  nothing 's been delayed for it ... and the fact that it 's essentially just a less complex rework of the ucas-d program , signifies that there really is n't any reason for it to be delayed ...  j20 and a variant of pak fa is the very definition of stealth bombers . . j20 is in no way a bomber ... like , there 's literally no aspect of that aircraft in any way signifies it 's a bomber ... 
  it 's a cross between an f-22 , an f-35 , and a mig-1 .44 ... pak-da is just theorized right now . 
  it 's no different than the shtorm carrier that 's been talked about for what , 3 fucking decades now ? 
  russia even stated they ca n't fund it on their own , and they 're hoping china helps them out , like india 's doing with the pak-fa . 
  talking about pak-da as if it 's anything other than the wetdream of russian defense bloggers , is honestly just dishonest . 
   in other words , you 've made them up and thus ca n't provide any actual source for the bullshit you repeatedly post on reddit . 
  so you obviously ca n't read , because i literally just linked it to you ...  did looked them up , and you 're the only source on those values . 
  so you refuse to acknowledge the existence of the links i just sent you ... alright . 
   admit it , you 've made them up and dedicate yourself to peddle bullshit on reddit that you 've made up . 
  i mean , one of us ** is ** making shit up , but it 's certainly not me , so i 'd take a good look in that mirror ...  if you were n't peddling bullshit you 've made up and actually had looked into the kuwait deal , you would be aware that kuwait actually paid italy to essentially hire the italian air force to manage kuwait 's air force for a period of 20 years , including logistics , operational support , training air crew and ground personel . 
  hey , guess what that 's called ? 
  it 's called , * gasp * , the fms cost ... and i literally ** just ** broke down what fms cost entails , which reads * awfully * similar to what you just stated ... fuck , some people are amaze me they do n't have to actually think to breathe ... 
  i got it from literal sales costs of them , which you would know , if you even ** tried ** to look them up , instead of coming up with your own bullshit figures . 
  but hey , fake it till you make it , and slander everyone in your way , right ?

  ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/2016/04/05/kuwait-signs-eurofighter-deal/82647386/ ) want me to continue with hard figures ? 
   that 's meaningless as the f35 does n't work , and apparently when it manages to run it even underperforms when compared with the f16 whose price tag is about 1/5th . 
  fucking hell , wib strikes again . 
  that 's incorrect . 
  an f-35 was hardcoded to a certain g limit , to see what would happen if it was pushed past the limit . 
  an f-16 flew alongside of it for flight comparison . 
  wib took that report , and made it into a dog fight that the f-35 lost . 
  hard to dog fight in af-02 , which has literally no combat systems installed on it , or when it 's g limited to just 6 gs , instead of its regular 9 g limit . 
  this false bs needs to die already , good lord . 
   that 's speculation , at best . 
  until then , the f35 remains by far the most expensive option inthe market , and one which does n't even work . 
  f-35 fms is literally over $ 100m cheaper than the eurofighter at this very moment ... [ australia paid $ 11.5 b usd \\ ( including $ 1.5 b usd of base redevelopments not just for the f-35 \\ ) for 58 f-35as for a price of $ 198m usd each .

  ] ( http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/2016/04/05/kuwait-signs-eurofighter-deal/82647386/ ) please tell me again how the eurofighter typhoon is cheaper ? 
  they 're actually not , and they 're ** especially ** not when you consider maintenance and spare parts . 
  foreign military sales ( fms ) includes the airframe , training for the pilot and mechanics , spare parts , maintenance contracts , etc. 
  fms of each | platform | fms cost ( in usd ) | | : -- | : -- | f-16e | $ 180m f/a -18 e | $ 193m f-35a | $ 198m rafale | $ 250m typhoon ( eurofighter ) | $ 300m who knew that when you barely make 200 of an aircraft , it 's far more expensive to keep operational than something that has nearly 4000 planned and almost 3000 ordered . 
  germany being assholes and refusing to make a eurofighter capable of operating off carriers , fucked them harder than they realize . 
  that alone drove france to develop the rafale . 
  combine the orders of both airframes , and then yeah , it would be the cheaper aircraft . 
  as it stands , they 're both more expensive . 
  for fucks sake , eurofighters are barely cheaper than f-22s ... 
  ciws or simply jam their frequency , via one of the multitude of ea/ew jammers on a carrier ? 
  typhoon is a multirole , it 's just been programmed piss poorly , so it lacks heavily in the isr and cas realms . 
  dan glazier and david axe are without question , the two single ** worst ** defense `` journalists '' in the industry . 
  they both also work for wib , and put out nearly all their articles . 
  there 's a reason wib is the laughing stock of defense journalism ... 
   actually no f35 is a political aircraft and nothing more f-35 is a multirole aircraft , literally no different than the rafale , eurofighter , f-16 , f/a -18 , f-15e , etc. 
  but when you give the * f-35 * that name , suddenly it means political aircraft . 
  nevermind how dominating the f-35 has been in literally ** every ** trial it 's had . 
  137:7 at the toughest red flag in history , with at least 2 of the losses being because red force jets re-spawned ( red force jets re-spawn to simulate a larger enemy force ) behind the f-35 and got instant shots off ? 
  that seems like something ...  u.s has a really big problem when it come on its air force and they wont have any solution till 2040 what does that even mean ? 
  that 's a nonsensical statement ...  they literally dont have any concept for a stealth air tanker except they do ? 
  kc-z is underway in preliminary design , and cbars joins the fleet early to mid 2020s ... that statement is simply 100 % incorrect . 
   if they ever go against a decent opposite force that can hold its own their current tankers are just a big sitting duck  plus they will have to stay a lot further out from the aa range of the enemy resulting on artificially decreasing the combat radius of their stealth fighters literally taking their advantage and shoving it into the ground literally everything not stealth is at risk . 
  but tankers can sit some 700km + away from the conflict , and be well outside the range of any enemy aircraft or aa system . 
  things like the f-35 have a 1200km combat radius . 
  put the tanker at 1000km out of the target , and let the f-35s do their thing . 
  nothing 's even coming close to touching that tanker ... stealth tankers are important going forward , due to nations like russia and china developing their own stealth aircraft , but they wo n't be realistically needed for another 10 to 15 + years . 
  there 's simply no threat to them , when combined with the ludicrous ranges of 5th gen aircraft . 
   there is a reason as to why both russia and china are developing fighters and bombers with specific characteristics but they 're not ? 
  they 're developing missiles with certain charateristics , like the k-100 and r-37 , which are designed to hit slow moving aircraft , like awacs , transports , and tankers . 
  however , even those max out around 300-400km . 
  so a su-35 has to magically get within 400km of a tanker , with no one seeing it ... an unlikely feat to say the least . 
  if the pak-fa ever comes around in any meaningful number , then yes , it becomes more of a likely feat ... but the pak-fa is slated for a production run of just 12 aircraft as it stands ... hardly a revolutionary threat to any of those platforms ... 
   russians on the other hand had no aircraft at air so why should ukranians even have buk ` s there also , just look at mh-17s flight path ... 
  it literally flew over kiev , and was completely fine . 
  what , are we * seriously * supposed to believe that the uaf thought it was a russian aircraft , but let it fly over their capital and only shot it down once it was about to leave their airspace ? 
  or are we supposed to believe that the rebels saw an aircraft coming from the west , assumed it was a ukrainian military aircraft , and shot it down ? 
  yeah , i personally believe the 2nd story , as the first is completely fucking moronic . 
  i 'd say cyprus well before crete ... 
  it 's only 400km from raf akrotiri to aleppo , but it 's 1200km from haf souda air base to aleppo . 
  i mean , they 'd have to deal with the absurd security at raf akrotiri , but better than having to have a tanker up to refuel their aircraft on literally 100 % of missions if they fly out of haf souda air base . 
  even then , only some ambassadors are politically appointed , most are fsos , or career diplomats, 
   the top people at each embassy are political appointees and are decidely not neutral not true . 
  only certain ambassadors are political appointees . 
  most are career diplomats . 
  the ones that are political appointees are usually only to the highest visibility locals , like london , berlin , tokyo , etc. 
  the 100 + other ambassadors and consulate generals are career foreign service officers ( fsos ) . 
  but that 's not necessarily a testament to how hard their fight was , but more so how ill-prepared and ill-equipped they were for the fight . 
  soldiers would literally go to into battle without a gun , and would just have to pick one off someone who fell in front of them . 
  if you 're using what is essentially a human meat grinder to win a war , then yeah , you 're going to have the highest causalities . 
  but it was n't . 
  if you stated russia basically won the war in * europe * , you 'd be correct . 
  but wwii was n't just in europe . 
  there were 5 main fronts to it ; eastern europe , western europe , southern europe , south pacific , and china . 
  russia 's commitment was entirely to a single front . 
  while that front , the eastern european front , largely screwed the germans over so badly on their other 2 fronts , that made it easier for the us/uk/canada / etc forces to press towards germany , their relevance to the pacific theater as a whole was non existent . 
  it 's completely ignorant of history to completely avoid an entire front of wwii , and down right ** wrong ** to say russia won wwii ... 
  no , any f-35 can carry 2 drop tanks . 
  hardpoints 3 and 9 are wet , and capable of carrying drop tanks . 
  that 's for all 3 versions of the f-35 . 
  israel is making a tank that takes up one of the internal bays , so it can stay stealthy . 
  not all of that fixed wings though .
