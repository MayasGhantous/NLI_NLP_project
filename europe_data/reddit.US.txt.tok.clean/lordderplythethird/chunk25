  7 merlins for aew , several helos for rescue , several helos for resupply , several chinooks to get royal marines ashore , several helos for asw , etc. 
  the thing is , the f-35 can still carry drop tanks , if it does n't need stealth . 
  a rafale ca n't do a mission the f-35 can if it requires stealth . 
  straight up , it 's as simple as that . 
  but the f-35 can do a mission the rafale can , by carrying drop tanks . 
  if the rafale can do it , stealth is n't required . 
  foreign military sales . 
  basically everything for the jet , not just the aircraft itself . 
  aircraft , training , spare parts , maintenance contracts , etc. 
  i dislike comparing strictly aircraft costs , because the f-35 comes with a lot of electronics that you have to buy additionally with the rafale , like targeting pods , or the future aesa radar upgrade when that comes out . 
  both of those are included in the fms cost , but not in the flyaway , so the $ 79m for the rafale vs $ 85m for the f-35 is n't really fully honest . 
  $ 3-5m for a single targeting pod alone , plus upgrading from a pesa to an aesa radar out of pocket ? 
  it 's just easier to compare the fms of the two . 
  f-35s as a whole , have ** massive ** ranges with just internal fuel . 
  f-35c on strictly internal fuel , can strike targets 1200km away . 
  f-35b on strictly internal fuel , can strike targets 900km away . 
  rafale m can strike targets 1800km away , but with ** 5 ** external fuel tanks carrying an extra 133 % fuel , which would mean its internal fuel range is roughly 800km . 
  cdg can , but there 's a very limited number of rafale ms in existence , and the cdg is smaller , so there 's not a lot of extra room for aircraft . 
  uk is getting some 138 f-35bs , which is plenty for both carriers , and then some . 
  a massive difference . 
  france uses the e-2c , which has a 2700km range and a 550km detection range . 
  uk 's going to use aw101s , which has a 800km range and a classified detection range , but a helicopter aew platform has ** never ** outranged a fixed wing one . 
  qe will be able to do more sorties per * deployment * , simply because of the ability to share the workload across more airframes , but cdg will always be able to get its airwing into the air faster . 
  plus , the f-35b actually has the same combat range as the rafale m . if they were both operating the same aircraft , then yes , the queen elizabeth 's fighters would have shorter ranges , but they 're not . 
  the differences will be 1 . 
  french carrier carries 20 fighters . 
  uks will carry 24 , with the ability to increase to 48 . 
  french carrier can launch heavy transports and awacs . 
  uk has to rely on helicopters . 
  french carrier can launch 1 fighter ever 30 seconds . 
  uk can launch 1 fighter every 60-90 seconds . 
  you would be surprised . 
  usaf alone , has 1601 f-15s , f-16s , and f-22s alone . 
  usmc has 338 f/a -18 s and f-35s alone . 
  usn has 668 f/a -18 s and f-35s alone . 
  combined , they have ** 2607 ** combat fighters . 
  that 's getting dangerously close to matching the rest of the planet , and we 're not even adding in things like the a-10 , ac-130 , b-1 , b-2 , b-52 , etc. 
  us has 100 awacs , to eu 's roughly 12 . 
  usn has 115 mpas to eu 's 40 . 
  usn has 4000 1500km + ranged cruise missiles for their ships to the eu 's 100 1000km ranged cruise missiles for their ships ( all french ) . 
  usn has 22 cruisers , to eu 's none . 
  usn has ** 63 ** destroyers , to eu 's 25 . 
  usn has 22 lhd , lph , lhas , and lpds to eu 's 12 . 
  usn has 10 ( +2 in reserves ) cvns to eus 3 . 
  the problem for the eu is , everyone 's procurement in done on their own . 
  so while the eu spends a ton of money as a whole , there 's massive gaps in capabilities , with a drastic over abundance in other ways . 
  for instance , the eu does n't need 125 frigates , but that 's what it has . 
  france on its own ca n't afford to have 15 destroyers and several cruisers , so it buys more frigates to get what it can . 
  germany does the same , as does italy , etc etc etc. 
  as a result , the amount of heavy surface combatants for the eu 's navy , is seemingly non existent . 
  the ** biggest ** issue , is seemingly no one in the eu , has long range logisitics capabilities . 
  even france was reliant on the usaf to get them to mali for operation serval , because they could n't on their own . 
  a400ms ca n't carry tanks to begin with . 
  then there 's the fact that they do n't have a lot of long range transports . 
  then there 's the fact that the few long range transports they * do * have , have to double as refuelers too . 
  it 's even worse in germany and italy . 
  there is 1 country in europe that can fly mbts on its own , and that 's the uk , thanks to their 8 c-17s . 
  the usaf has ** 222 ** c-17s , and 55 c-5s for comparison . 
   like i said , you ca n't qualify launching missiles from ships as real navy battle . 
  that 's literally what naval combat is . 
  there 's no duking it out with 5 '' guns on the sea . 
  why would i , when i can launch a sea skimming asm that can travel over 160km at over 860kmph ? 
  i 'm a fool if i think my main cannon is worth anything other than a last resort weapon . 
   i recognize we are n't as good as the us to waste billions in a stealth fighter that takes decades to get released take a guess at how much the rafale program costed , and how long it took ... rafale program started in 1979 , first flew in 1986 , and did n't go operational until 2001 . 
  it has a program cost of over $ 45b , with an average fms cost of $ 225m . 
  f-35 program started in 1994 , first flew in 2006 , and did n't go operational until 2015 . 
  f-35 costed $ 49b for program cost , with an average fms cost of $ 177m . 
  so 22 years for the rafale vs 21 for the f-35 , with extremely similar program costs , but a nearly $ 50m fms cost difference ( though largely due to how many aircraft for each will exist ) . 
  not to knock on the rafale , because it 's arguably the best 4.5 aircraft available , but to claim the us wasted too much money and time , but france somehow did n't , is just straight up wrong and needs to be called out . 
  mm ffg is multi-mission fast frigate guided or , a frigate armed with missiles that can do a variety of missions, 
  it 's the largest , most active terror threat in the us . 
  the problem is , it almost never gets labeled as such , so people do n't see how bad it is . 
  the multi-stabbing in portland for example , is being labeled a simple murder , even though he is a neo nazi and was attempting to attack muslims . 
  had they been reversed though , what would it be called ? 
  it already is . 
  * rafale fms to india : $ 250m a jet - [ source ] ( http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/india-s-rafale-fighter/2098584.html ) * f-35a fms to australia : $ 198m a jet - [ source ] ( http://archive.defensenews.com/article/20140423/defreg03/304230023/australia-purchases-58-more-f-35s ) who knew building only 300 of a jet would mean its maintenance contracts and spare parts would cost astronomically higher than a jet with nearly 4000 planned . 
  fms stands for foreign military sale , and it includes aircraft , spare parts , training for pilots/mechanics , and maintenance contracts . 
  knock out all those contracts in a single sale , instead of 5 different ones like russia and china prefer . 
  even disregarding the fms cost , f-35s have been in a constant and consistent price drop , which you can see [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/1homy06.jpg ) , and are well on track to beat the rafale in even basic flyaway cost by full production ( literally the just the aircraft cost ) . 
  f-35s maintenance is also far lower , because of how common spare parts are going to be . 
  there 's a planned 500 eurofighters right now . 
  there 's a planned 4000 f-35s . 
  it 's easier to get spare parts , when there 's 8 times as many of them around . 
  elephant square !, 
  if you go to the left side of the square , there 's arguably one of the best restaurants in all of sicily . 
  just like anonpoland claimed responsibility for the democratic party hack in the us right ? 
  it 's literally the exact same all over , step by step by step . 
  oh whoops , did n't know i was responding to a troll . 
  10/10 , you got me, 
  they do pay more in the sense that they pay an fms ( foreign military sales ) cost while the us pays strictly flyaway . 
  fms = flyaway + maintenance contracts + training + spare parts this is done so dod , dos , congress in the us only has to approve of 1 thing regarding those aircraft , vs approving the aircraft , then approving the training , then approving the spare parts , then approving the depot maintenance contracts . 
  it 's easier to just combine them all together when you do the sale . 
  they 're not actually paying more for the aircraft itself , they 're just getting more things than just the aircraft when they order them , so their order costs are higher , but the flyaway cost of the aircraft itself stays the same no matter if it 's the us/uk/italy / turkey/japan/australia / etc ordering them . 
  also , if you 're really interested in the f-35 , i 'd give dragon029 a follow . 
  he 's like ** the ** reddit expert , hands down imo . 
  because germany and sweden did n't publicly announce that poland was going to have to fund testing for the taurus 350 to work off the f-16s they have , which made the taurus 350 ** far ** more expensive . 
  taurus 350s do n't work off f-16s . 
  there 's never been a test , there 's no combat code on the f-16 for them , there 's no way to use them off the f-16 . 
  germany and sweden liked to conveniently leave that off their sales brochure for it . 
  also because the jassm is smaller by 800lbs , meaning polish f-16s can carry 5 of them , vs only 2 taurus 350s .
