  it 's not just a german issue , it 's prevalent with virtually every military in europe . 
  it 's exacerbated by the fact that everyone operates independently , so europe has an insane amount of fighters , but virtually 0 awacs or refuelers to support all those fighters . 
  europe has a ton of surface ships , but virtually 0 unrep ( underway replenishment ) ships to refuel and rearm them while they 're deployed . 
  that , in turn is made * even worse * , by the fact that places like the uk completely shut down munition plants , then spend millions just to restart the plant , to buy a few more weapons before shutting it down again , instead of simply constantly procuring a steady stream of munitions that 's enough to keep stockpiles at adequate levels while preventing the plant from constantly starting and shutting down . 
  fine , be pedantric . 
  european countries were the ones that pressed for libya . 
  as did italy , as did the uk . . 
  but sure , we can revise history i suppose ... 
  i guess it was n't sarkosky who demanded intervention in syria either , right ? 
  hilarious , since it was europe that pressed for libya ... or did we forget cameron and sarkosky foaming at the mouth demanding intervention in libya already ? 
  once canada had a competent surface fleet to protect the mistral , then they could integrate it into nato/joint missions . 
  you 're right that canada ca n't independently engage someone ( though , they could if they met the nato mandate of 2 % , but they 're currently below 1 % and dropping even more ) , but it could be a large boost for their presence in nato , which would give them a larger say in it . 
  if you look at the theoretical tiers of nato , it would be huge for canada . 
  t1 : us , france , uk t2 : germany , italy , turkey t3 : netherlands , norway , spain , poland , canada , etc etc etc it would give capabilities to canada that would elevate them to a closer circle of importance within nato leadership . 
  also , as the polar region continues to melt , and as russia begins to try and assert its control over what it claims as its own in the artic ( essentially the whole damn thing ) , canada 's going to need the ability to rapidly deploy forces as a means of defending its interests , and that 's something the mistral could absolutely be invaluable in . 
  egypt got the mistrals for the same reason saudi arabia got $ 125m f-15sas . 
  the middle east has an obsession with buying shiny military hardware they have no capability to use effectively . 
  ksa , egypt , oman , yemen , uae , qatar ... they all buy the most advanced hardware , even though they have virtually no military training/ability to fight effectively . 
  uae paid for the development of the most expensive f-16 ever created , the f-16e . 
  it costs ** more ** than an f-35 , and they 're just now using it to drop dumb bombs on houthi rebels in northern yemen . 
  mistrals are nothing more than a `` look at how big our navy 's dick is ! '', 
  for egypt to wag around . 
  if you 're using an amphibious assault warship for national water patrols , your navy is moronic . 
  40 tanks and up to 900 troops . 
  that 's what a mistral can carry over 20,000 kilometers . 
  they 're an amphibious assault ship , designed to transport forces to a foreign enemy 's shore for attack . 
  they can be used for humanitarian efforts and missions like that , but if you 're buying a ship of that kind for that kind of mission , instead of using a simple and cheap commerical freighter , your navy 's , simply put , moronic . 
  it 's absolutely the sensable naval group . 
  they 're called an amphibious ready group ( arg ) , and nations with amphibious warships operate them . 
  us , france , australia ( soon ) , japan , italy , south korea , spain , and uk all have args , or an equivalent of an arg . 
  especially if you look at the route mh17 took . 
  it flew all across ukraine , including kiev , before it was shot down just as it was flying over rebel territory . 
  are we supposed to believe that ukraine thought an aircraft that had already flown over the entirety of ukraine was suddenly now a threat , or the more simple reality that the rebels saw a plane getting close , got ansty , and pulled the trigger ? 
   it was not meant to replace the a-10 as the weapons on the f-35 are not as useful in danger close situations as the brrt gun . 
  it was n't meant to replace the a-10 's role in cas , because the a-10 's role in cas was already replaced . 
  multiroles like the f-16 and f-15e already do over 80 % of cas for the us . 
  a-10s were slated for retirement anyways just because other aircraft do their only job more often than they do it , and do it just as well . 
  f-35 is simply replacing the f-16 's cas role , which has essentially replaced the a-10 at this point . 
  f-35 's gau-22a is more advanced and more accurate than the a-10 's gau-8 . 
  while it 's a slightly smaller round ( 25mm vs 30mm ) , the difference is negligable , as the 30mm is n't killing anything the 25mm is n't , and neither are killing a tank born in the last half century . 
  while the f-35 does n't carry as many rounds as the a-10 , the gau-22a is selective fire , so you can select how many rounds you wish to fire instead of simply pulling the trigger for x seconds , meaning you can hit that ridgeline with just 5 he rounds if you want , or 17 , or 3 , or 32 , or however many your heart desires . 
   if i were to fight in line of sight , i would want to be in an eagle . 
  if you wanted to dog fight , you want a viper ( f-16 ) . 
  nothing in the us ' arsenal beats the f-16 in a dog fight , nothing . 
  hell , even bagged f-16s beat clean f-15s all day long in dog fights . 
  it 's not even close . 
  only thing that comes close to the f-16 in a dog fight , is the f/a -18 a/b/c / d. 
  f/a -18 e/fs are heavier , and more akin to the navy 's verion of the f-15e , but the f/a -18 a/b/c / ds came out of the same program that the f-16 came out of , and bare quite similar flight characteristics . 
  mistrals would have been useless on canada . 
  to operate a ship like the mistral , you need a competent surface fleet to escort it , which is not something canada has . 
  12 aging frigates that are barely armed at all , and 1 destroyer that 's avoiding sinking via prayers and ducktape . 
  that 's it . 
  that 's the entire canadian navy . 
  maybe in 30 years when they ** finally ** agree on replacing those ships 20 years after they 've sank , * then * canada could look at something like the mistrals . 
  a us carrier has never been sunk in an exercise when the carrier has been allowed to use active sonar . 
  we 're just not allowed to use active sonar in times of peace because it harms marine life , so we have to rely on passive sonar during the exercises . 
  while passive sonars are insanely capable , when you have a fleet of 20 + surface ships operating in a narrow grid designated for the exercise , all your passive sonar is picking up is the screws of the ships around you . 
  put passive sonar out on the open ocean and it operates far more effectively . 
  turn on active sonar , and nothing 's going to have an easy time avoiding you . 
  germany 's subs are more geared for green water operations ( close to shore ) , while australia wanted blue water submarines ( open ocean ) . 
  they did n't really have a choice at that point , since both the german and japanese designs were green water subs . 
  there 's zero political will in australia for nuclear anything . 
  they 're not as extreme as new zealand who have banned nuclear anything , but it 's pretty damn close . 
  again , the heat is not detectable if the sub is even 10-15 meters below the surface , even when the submarine is idle . 
  the only time you 'll ever notice it , is if it 's pulled into port ( and you should see it with the naked eye anyways ) , or if it 's surfaced for some reason ( which they never do unless it 's for port ) source : i 'm a former us navy asw ( anti-submarine warfare ) guy, 
  not a lobbyist lol , but what 's wrong with atomic energy ? 
  gravelines nuclear plant in france produces more electricity than all tidal plants in the world combined ... it 's a constant power output unlike virtually any renewable energy , and it does it without fucking the marine ecosystem to hell . 
  not a lobbyist , but sure as shit do n't see what 's wrong with nuclear power as a stable energy source to be suplimented by renewables ... 
  tidal energy has actually been around since the 1960s ( france built the first one iirc ) . 
  there 's a multitude of problems with it though . 
  it 's ** insanely ** expensive for the amount of energy it puts out 2 . 
  it does n't put out much energy . 
  largest tidal energy plant in the world is 17 miles long , and puts out 250mw of power at peak times ( not a constant 250mw ) 3 . 
  it destroys marine ecosystems due to the constant movement disrupting the natural waterflow 4 . 
  the noise drives marine life away , often times killing off any fishing industry that existed in the area 5 . 
  the noise has the same effect sonar does on whales and dolphins it 's definitely something to invest into and part of a renewable energy future , but it 's still extremely damaging to the sea at this point in time . 
  it 's warontherocks ... it 's shitty clickbait defense journalism , just like warisboring . 
  most people who follow defense journalism stay far the hell away from them , as they 're generally horseshit with no basis in reality . 
  hungary and poland caused wwii , do n't you remember ? 
  technically , any turbulence would effect both air frames as long as they were in a close proximity , and they would move more or less together . 
  that 's how air show aircraft can fly in such close proximity without a bit of wind killing everyone . 
  a pilot 's hand slipping though ... well , as / u/parameters stated , that 's already happened in the past, 
   you know that the us has multiple strategically important bases in germany ? 
  you mean the ones for communications , which already have operational backup facilities outside of germany . 
  i worked one in italy for example ... outside of the comm relay facilities , literally everything in germany , can be placed elsewhere . 
  even the comm relay facilities can transfer over to their backup and tertiary facilities , they would just need to create a new tertiary facility in the region , which is n't hard . 
  even now , most new comms equipment is avoiding germany , and finding its way in italy ( specifically sicily ) . 
  german relay hubs are no where near as important as people online try to make them out to be . 
   the logistics branch of the bundeswehr also is not nearly in as bad shape as you describe it . 
  it 's the single worst i ever worked with , without question . 
  even the greeks handled their shit better , and they 're broke as hell . 
  point in case , the logistics helos for the navy that are n't qualified to ... get this ... ** operate via a ship ** . 
  billions on helos , that ca n't even do the 1 mission they were purchased to do ... 
  the a400ms that cost damn near as much as a c-17 , yet carry half as much , but spend all their time on the flight deck because they 're quite literally , always grounded due to safety flaws they keep discovering ...  also assuming that germany does not spy on its allies is stupid , just as it is stupid to be outraged that he us is trying to get inteligence on germany . 
  that 's the fucking point of inteligence agencies . 
  i completely agree , which is why i pointed out the hypocrisy in the comment before me . 
  though , is a dishonest comparison between western and non-western countries for * anything * . 
  a russian private only makes $ 400usd a month , while a uk private makes ... what , around $ 1800usd after the conversion ? 
  russia pays their members , on average , 1/3rd what the eu does , because , quite simply , the radical cost of living differences . 
  do n't believe me , fine .
