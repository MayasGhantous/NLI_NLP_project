  russian defense spending total ( 2015 ) : $ 85b usd us defense spending allotment for salaries ( 2015 ) : $ 153b usd granted , the us has 1.4 m active duty members ( including the coast guard ) while russia only has 800k ( not including their coast guard ) , but you can still clearly see just from that alone , what an impact cost of living can make with the troops ' salaries alone . 
  calculate lower salaries and wages for the people making the hardware on top of all that , and the differences become night and day . 
  france and india . 
  both spend $ 51b usd a year on their militaries . 
  one has 360k members , the other has 1.5 m. 
  one has 250 tanks , the other has 4000 . 
  one has 230 combat fighters in total , the other has 270 su-30mkis alone . 
  one has zero strategic transports , the other has 27 . 
  over half of india 's military budget , is importing hardware , yet the overwhelming bulk of india 's military hardware these days , were designed and built in india . 
  looking at budgets alone , you would think india and france were nearly the same strength wise , but the reality is that india ** far ** surpasses france in virtually everything ( military wise ) . 
  that 's why dollar to dollar/euro to euro/ruble to ruble means nothing between western and non-western nations . 
   eu has a way larger combined military budget . 
  not even remotely true . 
  uk and france spend a combined $ 114b usd on defense , and they make up 40 % of the entire eu 's military spending ... meaning the eu 's entire military budget is $ 285b usd . 
  us ' is $ 610.1 b usd . 
  to make it even worse , there 's no unified eu military . 
  it 's a bunch of independent countries with their own militaries , all grouped together . 
  the issue with that is , it 's extremely poorly optimized and not all that effective , if we 're being honest . 
  look at the eu 's combined navy . 
  there 's a good amount of subs ( roughly 40 + ) . 
  there 's a ** ton ** of patrol ships ( 500 + ) . 
  there 's a lot of frigates ( 100 + ) . 
  there 's roughly only a dozen destroyers though . 
  there 's only 5 stovl carriers , and 1 catobar carrier . 
  but how many replenishment ships for that fleet ? 
  there 's like 10 unrep ships for that entire fleet . 
  look at the eu 's combined air force . 
  there 's a lot of fighers ( 100 + ) . 
  there 's a good amount of medium transports ( 150 + ) . 
  but there 's only a dozen refuelers and a dozen aewc/awacs , and only ** 8 ** long range transports that can even carry armor ( all 8 belong to the uk ) . 
  eu spends a lot of money , but they all do it independently , so it 's inefficient and flawed to hell . 
  what makes it even worse is when countries try to do projects on their own ( hello rafale ) , or do a project together but argue over production and cause the cost to skyrocket ( hello eurofighter ) . 
  and you should pay us for training your military , since large chunks of the german military does n't get training unless it 's a joint us-german exercise . 
  and flying it everywhere it needs to go because the german air force has zero means of transporting armor ** anywhere ** . 
  and replenishing your ships while underway . 
  and providing virtually 100 % of nato comms and logistics . 
  and providing awacs since germany thinks they 're not important . 
  and the multiples of incompetence within the german military alone , that the us simply supplements , 100 % free on charge . 
  wan na pay each other and see who owes fucking who money ? 
  because it wo n't be the us owing money . 
  but live in fantasy world where germany 's not spying on all of its allies . 
  unless you believe that [ france ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20151112/france-demands-answers-over-german-spying ) or [ us ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-bnd-intelligence-spied-on-friends-and-vatican-a-1061588.html ) or [ denmark ] ( http://www.thelocal.dk/20151109/denmark-to-do-nothing-about-alleged-germany-spying ) are not german allies ... 
  not openly and publicly , no . 
  but if you inform him via closed diplomatic channels of what you 're planning on doing , and why ... he has to seriously think about what will come from it . 
  if he continued his current path , us would put abms next to russia . 
  russian nationalists would ** eat him alive ** if he did n't retaliate , but retaliating against a defensive move instantly makes him the aggressor , and gets essentially the whole world bearing down on him and sees him out of office 1 way or the other . 
  on the other hand , he can privately agree to end these aggressive moves , if the us agrees to not place abm capabilities near russia . 
  russia can still monitor ships from safer distances as per the 1970s agreement , and no one outside of them is the wiser . 
  russian nationalists still get to see russian fighters close to us warships . 
  us gets to exercise in international waters without fear of an international incident . 
  putin keeps abm out of eastern europe for the time being . 
  either everyone wins , or everyone ( including putin ) loses , and putin 's too proud and egotistical to let himself lose . 
  i would n't shoot them down . 
  makes us stoop down to putin 's level of immaturity on the international scale , and gives him the leverage to go :  evil west . 
  poor russian fighter was just investigating why you were so close to russia , and you shot him down for no reason , because that 's what you westerners crave ; russian blood . 
  do n't shoot it down . 
  spool up ciws and have it track the fighter , and do a few sprays into the water right by the ship so the pilot can see it * is * armed , and he 'll be landing with a dirty flight suit . 
  record the flights , and criticize the russian military 's unprofessionalism , and inability to act like civilized adults instead of mere children throwing temper tantrums over international waters . 
  remind them that it 's a direct violation of the 1970s agreement , like crimea was a direct violation of the budapest memorandum . 
  inform them that if russia feels it can continue to violate international agreements it has signed with the us whenever it feels like , then the us might feel it has to deploy pac-3 anti-ballistic missile capabilities to eastern nato countries , because we 're not sure what other treaties putin feels like throwing to the wind whenever he feels like . 
  he 'll be forced to back down quick , simply to prevent abm capabilities at the footsteps of russia . 
  not professional ones . 
  it 's a dangerous and reckless move , and it 's actually fucking banned by the us and russia to engage in simulated straffing runs on each others warships in times of peace ... 
  they 're a fanatical `` putin can do no wrong da west is da evils '' user , so probably ... 
   now they 're just letting the russians fly like they own the place . 
  lol . 
  russia got bitch slapped by turkey , and guess what ? 
  there has n't been a single new russian violation of turkish airspace since then . 
  certainly displays an entirely different image than the ignorant and completely baseless rhetoric you 're spewing out ... 
  and another nuclear reactor closer was completely fine because its seawall was built to code . 
  fukoshima 's seawall was n't to code . 
  tsunami went over it , and that 's what caused their problems . 
  easily avoidable if regulations were abided . 
  that 's not and issue with nuclear power , that 's an issue with proper inspections , something any power plant can suffer from . 
  ... why ? 
  cattenom went online in 1986 . 
  that 's right in the middle of the life for nuclear power . 
  it 's one of the most modern nuclear power plants in france . 
  it 's up to date on all of it 's safety checks . 
  there 's literally zero reason to shut it down , outside of fear mongering over nuclear power , due to problems in a plant that was n't built to proper standards in japan , along an area prone to seismic activity ... something that does n't apply to the region cattenom is in . 
  using gray , and skirting with illegal areas , in order to reduce the amount of taxes paid could , and is , considered morally corrupt by many people , that 's why . 
  when a company like apple makes $ 56b usd in * profits * , but pays just $ 3.3 b usd in total taxes , for an effective tax rate of under 6 % , even though internationally they should be paying 15 % , or $ 8.5 b usd , it 's not * just * simply avoiding paying taxes . 
  where do those taxes go ? 
  they 're not just sitting in scrooge mcduck 's vault for him to swan dive into . 
  they 're used for funding government programs ... everything from building new schools , to repairing roads , to welfare , to medical care , to everything inbetween . 
  what happens then ? 
  well , then you 're left with $ 5b usd less than what you should have , so you have to cut $ 5b usd from your budget . 
  from 1 company . 
  add microsoft . 
  add ibm . 
  add adobe . 
  add facebook . 
  add general electric . 
  add johnson and johnson . 
  if they 're all avoiding the same $ 5b ( some are likely more , some are likely less ) , you 're almost at the gdp of the entire nation of bulgaria . 
  from just 7 companies . 
  make it 50 . 
  what effect does that cause on government budgets across the globe ? 
  even then , it depends on the local laws and regulations . 
  for instance , if a company had their international hq in ireland , their regional hq in each country would `` lease '' the intellectual property from the hq in ireland , and market it in their respective country .
