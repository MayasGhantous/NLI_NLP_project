  by using regional offices , while keeping the ip and main hq based overseas , they did n't have to pay a dime in money made outside of the nation the regional hq was in , because that was a jurisdiction of the main hq , only ireland offered essentially 0 % tax rates for any profits made overseas . 
  if they used banking in panama , they would have literally ** 0 ** obligations to inform our tax authorities of any of that , because it 's quite frankly , none of our tax authorities ' business at that point . 
  it 's shady , and morally corrupt , but it 's 100 % legal and there 's no obligation for them to tell a soul about it if they do n't want to . 
  virtually every single major company uses tax havens . 
  there was no * serious * outrage at * apple * microsoft * ibm * adobe * facebook etc were all caught doing the double irish , why would/should companies using panama as a tax haven be literally any different ? 
  yeah , it 's * morally * corrupt from a certain standpoint , but from a business standpoint it 's just smart finances , and from a legal perspective , it 's not criminal in any way . 
  well , it 's not really true . 
  germany 's logistics fleet is almost 100 % c-160s , which have insanely small flight ranges , and ca n't even carry ifvs . 
  the reality of european logistics is that the raf is literally the only ones in europe that have a transport plane that can transport mbts and armor to a conflict zone . 
  c-160s can do troops and pallets , but outside of that , good luck . 
  a400ms can do troops , pallets , and ifvs , but still ca n't do mbts . 
  everyone in europe outside of the uk , is 100 % reliant on the usaf in that regards . 
  that 's how france got their leclerc tanks to mali . 
  that 's how everyone got their gear to iraq/afghanistan . 
  we already closed a multitude of us bases in germany , and even pulled 100 % of our armored forces out of germany . 
  not even a year later though , german government begged us to bring the armor back , because the units there were giving free training to german armor units , which ended up being virtually all the training the german armor got , so now we have armored units back in germany , much to our chagrin . 
  i doubt they 'd outright close them , but they 'd undoubtedly ** drastically ** reduce their footprint . 
  it 's our way of saying to russia `` look , we 're not increasing our military presence in eastern europe , so calm down '' , while increasing our military presence at the same time . 
  that , and occasional deployments through the area are all we can really do to increase our military presence to alleviate fears expressed by the overwhelming number of citizens within eastern european nato states , while not giving russia anymore reasons to continue to threaten nuclear strikes on the baltics at the same time . 
  building donald trump usafb in estonia is a good way to provoke russia , while stashing away m1s and such in bunkers and occasional fighter jet deployments to the country are far lower provocations, 
  war stocks are exactly that though . 
  we store vehicles , armor , fuel , munitions , etc in bunkers across allied nations . 
  if we need it , we simply get it . 
  if they need it , we sign it over to them . 
  during operation protective edge in israel for example , us signed over our 120mm mortar shells and 40mm grenades from our war stocks in israel to the israeli military for use . 
  the same would happen to our warstocks in the uk/poland/norway / turkey/etc . 
  if we needed the gear , we would just show up and pull it out for whatever we need it for . 
  if they run into a full on war , we 'd sign over the stock to them , and they would use it . 
  also , the massive influx of refugees is because of a horrid `` open door '' policy inacted by merkel 's bleeding heart that fucked virtually every single nation in the eu, 
  because to side with argentina they 'd have to go through the unsc where it 'd be instantly veto 'd , and then to the unga , where it would disappear with a million other moronic votes that get lost for good reason . 
  but the un ' commission on the limits of the continental shelf ... well , lets look at the current members on it : * pakistan * nigeria * mexico * trinidad & tobago * russia * canada and uk ( apparently count as 1 for unclcs ) * denmark * cameroon * croatia * china * malaysia * mozambique * brazil * kenya * ghana * south korea * argentina * india * netherlands * japan * poland so a large number of anti-colonist governments and countries comprised of former colonies . 
  wonder if that had any effect on the vote ... 
  even then though unclos iii should pretty clearly state that a continental shelf claim does n't supersede another 's territorial waters or eez ... 
  since argentina and the falklands are almost exactly 300 miles from each other , they should , by my understanding of unclos iii at least , have rights to up to 150 miles in the waters between the two . 
  [ something like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/drslvmu.jpg ) , if you can ignore my shitty ms paint skills . 
  so falklands would lose around 50miles of their eez , but they should have already been losing something like 25 miles due to argentina 's previous 200 mile claim . 
  but argentina should not be able to claim the waters up to the falklands , let alone past it , anymore than [ south korea , china , or russia can claim japan 's waters ... ] ( http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/ryodo_eg/img/torikumi/kaiho/pr02-photo01.jpg ), 
  i love online polls like this . 
  usaf has a ( joke ) online poll to name their new b-21 bomber . 
  leading name right now is o-bomber, 
  i 'd prefer countries maintain their own national security services , with an eu-based overarching organization that each country feeds with intel they feel is relevant , and every other nation can access said info . 
  as strong as the eu is , it 's still a collective of sovereign states that all have their own goals and interests . 
  france still needs intelligence on uk and germany just as badly as they need intel on france . 
  an eu only intelligence agency would be a massive failure for that aspect alone . 
  but as is , if sis in the uk has information that might be of relevance to belguim , german , and netherlands , it has to share with every intelligence organization in all 3 countries , which is a massive and colossal shit show . 
  make it easier , by making a central hub where sis can upload the intelligence , and those nations ' respective intelligence agencies can pull the information at their leisure and act upon it as needed . 
  it does n't even say he called the strike on himself , but rather :  the officer died as a hero , he drew fire onto himself after being located and surrounded by terrorists does n't mean he called a strike on himself . 
  could have been he got separated from his team but isis did n't find him and were getting close to his team , so he made a distraction to draw their fire on him so his team could escape . 
  the only mention of airstrikes at all , is  an officer of russian special operations forces was killed near palmyra while carrying out a special task to direct russian airstrikes at islamic state group targets so he was a jtac , but `` drew fire onto himself '' does n't mean he called in a strike on himself . 
  we 're not all that ignorant . 
  only some of us are truly burgers, 
  and there 's 9eyes and 14eyes ... which do n't include any former uk colonies ... 
  a european variant of 5eyes is all europe needs . 
  a central hub that each nation contributes information they have that they feel is beneficial for the others . 
  like bloody fucking hell any sensable country is going to give up their intelligence agency tasked with protecting their nation 's interests , for an overarching european agency that would simply only care for the overall european interest . 
  france losing its ability to spy on germany ? 
  not going to happen . 
  uk losing its ability to spy on france ? 
  not going to happen . 
  currently , each agency has to pass on info to the respective agencies in other countries . 
  uk alone has what , 5 + intelligence agencies ? 
  a central hub means you do n't have to inform people , they inform themselves on what you thought was important for everyone to know , while not fucking over any nation 's sovereign intelligence capabilities . 
  that wo n't happen . 
  every nation 's intelligence agency is tasked with protecting their nation 's interests , and to do that , they 're also spying on other nations , no matter how friendly . 
  people forget ( or choose to ignore ) the reality , which is france 's intelligence agency is out to protect france , and doing that includes spying on the us , uk , germany , italy , etc. . as much , if not more so , than it does monitoring radical elements within the country . 
  what europe needs is , each nation continues their own sovereign intelligence agencies , but make a unified europe one that 's more or less a mediator . 
  france has info on some radical elements , and passes it on to the eia or whatever it ends up being called , so that each nation can access that information and track the element as needed . 
  a single intelligence agency is n't going to work right now anymore than a european military is . 
  each nation is still its own nation , and national priorities still outweigh those of eu/european priorities . 
  simple as that really . 
   you do n't add up state/local gov budgets to goverment budgets to paint different picture same as you do n't add up private debt to goverment debt . 
  ... oh , i see , you want to change how taxes and funding works to confirm your ignorant and completely basis preconceived ideas . 
  well , i choose to operate in reality , and grasp how us budgets work , and comprehend that it 's different in the us than in europe , and understand that us state and local government spending has ** far ** greater impact than eu local government spending does ... but cheers man , i do n't feel like trying to have a discussion who chooses to redraw reality to confirm their ignorant and completely baseless ideas , so have a good one . 
  again , that is the ** federal budget ** . 
  there 's $ 3,690 b federal spending , $ 1,580 b state spending , and $ 1,770 b local spending . 
  going off * just * the federal budget , is simply put , dishonest and ignorant of us taxes and budgets . 
  we not only pay federal taxes , but also state and local taxes as well , as each level of the government is in charge of funding certain things . 
  yes , the entire defense budget of the us is around 22 % of the federal budget alone , it 's 12 % of the combined federal , state , and local budgets , because state and local governments are in charge of education , transportation , welfare , etc. 
  us federal government only funds * federal * programs , and the defense umbrella is obviously the largest federal program . 
  i mean , if we look at just state and local budgets , the entire us defense umbrella is only $ 1.8 b , while education is $ 942.6 b. 
  but that 's not being honest , so we do n't do that . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/united_states_total_spending_pie_chart ) is the breakdown of federal , state , and local budgets , and how much is * actually * spent on each program , when you combine the 3 budgets . 
  veteran retirements are handled by the treasury department , sure , but the treasury department 's entire budget , is $ 22b . 
  even if 100 % of that was for veteran pensions , it does n't even raise the defense budget by .5 % in regards to just the federal budget , and just .2 % for the combined budgets . 
  it 's still 12 % , accounting for literally ** everything ** military related . 
  it just fluctuates between 12 % and 12.3 % it does n't magically go up by 8 % , or $ 512b , just because of veteran retirements ... 
  defense spending is everything . 
  nsa , cia , dia , oni , dod , etc dod budget comes from defense spending . 
  dod 's budget is roughly $ 620b , and the other $ 210b goes to the various military intelligence agencies , with the bulk of it going to the nsa , disa , and cia for obvious reasons . 
   it spends more on defense than it does on education , personal management , transportation , agriculture and labour combined . 
  completely untrue . 
  if you knew us budgets , you 'd understand that the federal government is n't responsible for those items , the states and local governments are . 
  combine all the us budgets , and you end up with | item | amount ( in billions ) | percentage | : -- | : -- | : -- | healthcare | 1486.6 | 22 pensions | 1293.7 | 19 education | 1008.5 | 15 defense | 830.9 | 12 other | 531.2 | 8 welfare | 456.4 | 7 interest | 351.4 | 5 transportation | 297.2 | 4 protection ( law enforcement ) | 288.3 | 4 general | 181 | 3 defense accounts for 12 % of our spending , behind education , and almost half as much as government funded healthcare alone . 
  if we 're just looking at the federal budget , then sure . 
  us defense spending trumps all those other things ... but education , healthcare , etc are all almost strictly state/locally funded items . 
   they have crippling poverty for the first world , they have extreme wealth inequality , they have huge communities with absurdly high crime rates and rampant unemployment , they have black people rioting in the streets regularly etc. 
  not really ? 
  this sounds like simple ignorant propaganda and rhetoric with no basis in reality . 
  unemployment in the us is 5.0 % , * lower * than the 5.8 % unemployment in the uk ... is the uk facing rampant unemployment ? 
  did n't think so .
