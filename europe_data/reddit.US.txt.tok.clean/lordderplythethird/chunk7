  they demolished home after home until the entire village was destroyed , '' said one witness . 
   `` they told us we had to leave or they would tell the us coalition that we were terrorists and their planes would hit us and our families , '' said one resident , safwan . 
   `` they started pouring fuel in my in-laws ' house . 
  my mother-in-law was there refusing to leave and they just poured it around her ... they found my father-in-law and began hitting him on his hands ... i said , ` even if you burn my house i will get a tent and pitch it.this is in my place . 
  i will stay in my place , '' said bassma . 
   in an interview with amnesty international , the head of the asayish admitted civilians had been forcibly displaced but dismissed these as `` isolated incidents '' . 
  the spokesperson for the ypg repeated claims that civilians were being moved for their own security . 
   however , many residents said they were forced to leave even though their villages had not been the site of clashes , or were at a distance from the frontline and there was no danger from improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) laid by is . 
  turkey 's not shelling rojava , turkey 's shelling pyd forces attacking fsa forces that had just taken a military base from assad ... http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/13/turkey-shells-kurdish-forces-in-syria-in-retaliation-for-attack-on-border-posts  the shelling took place on saturday after kurdish fighters , backed by russian bombing raids , drove syrian rebels from a former military air base near the turkish border . 
  turkey is allied with the krg . 
  erdogan has publically stated he would support an iraqi kurdistan state . 
  iraqi kurdistan would border with turkey ... http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/130620142  the kurds of iraq have the right to decide the future of their land , said huseyin celik , a spokesman for turkey 's ruling justice and development party ( akp ) on friday . 
  http://ekurd.net/turkey-supports-arming-peshmerga-2015-11-10  `` if us want to arm and help peshmerga groups in iraq against is or help them to go to syria and fight against is , we are ready to help , '' unless kurdish media is owned by the turkish government and lies ... what you 're saying , is , simply put , ignorant rhetoric and lies , that are easily disproven in seconds online . 
  pakistan is ** far ** more of a us ally than a russian one ... pakistan fucking hates russia and iran ... why would they work * with * them ? 
  lol, 
  * turkey has 180 + working fighters , more than any nato state ( outside of the us ) * turkey has 4 awacs , more than any european nato state * turkey has 7 dedicated heavy tankers , more than any european nato state * turkey has 13 attack submarines , more than any european nato state * turkey has 350 + generation iii main battle tanks , more than any european nato state ( with the exception of the uk ) * turkey has 1700 generation ii and iii mbts , more than any nato state ( excluding the us ) * turkey has over 1000 self propelled artillery systems , more than any european nato state * turkey can mine the bosphorus strait , completely isolating russia 's only warm weather port to the atlantic turkey is ** far ** more important to nato than people seem to give it credit for ... 
  defense spending is virtually an entirely useless figure to use . 
  it completely ignores cost of living and cost of manufacturing differences . 
  pkk and pyd are allies ... pyd itself , considers itself to be the syrian branch of the pkk . 
  they allow the pkk to use their territory as a springboard for attacks on turkey . 
  they hold the congra el as their own legislature . 
  they hold ocalan as their leader ... yeah turkey 's bombing the pyd 's forces in syria . 
  pyd forces have been attacking nonkurdish civilians and are inflaming the refugee problem as they attempt to ethnically cleanse northern syria of anyone not pyd ... that , and they 're now working with russia to eliminate the fsa , who turkey supports ... why do you think even the krg ( iraqi kurdistan ) fucking hates the pyd ? 
  us is qualifying the f-35bs off the queen elizabeth carriers and italy 's carriers as well . 
  it 's more so the fact that the mistrals do n't really have the aviation center designed to handle and support fixed wings , and they 're less than 200m long , and an f-35b needs roughly 175m for take offs ... that means you 'd have to run it from 1 end all the way to the other for take off , and you would n't be able to land a fighter while another takes off . 
  oh they and canada are a perfect match ... it 's just canada 's military gets funded at a laughable amount ( less than 1 % gdp now ) , so they ca n't afford why they actually should be getting sadly . 
  ehhh , mistral 's would have been too much for canada at the time . 
  they only have 13 surface combat ships , and no support ships . 
  that means the mistral 's would have either gone out completely undefended , or gone out with barely any defense . 
  either way , it would have had to gone out with zero replenishment support . 
  if canada still had the 4 iroquois destroyers and they were n't all in the condition the athabaskan currently is in , and they had their replenishment ships from germany in hand , the mistral 's would have been an awesome addition to them . 
  as is , canada needs to get a surface fleet rebuilt before they can add a flag ship like the mistral to it . 
  there 's literally a dozen of us !!, 
  rough raleigh born an raised !, 
  canadian government is currently looking at getting new warships to replace the last iroquois destroyer which is currently kept afloat by a roll of ducktape and prayers . 
  canadian shipbuilders are protesting even considering buying a foreign made ship , because it 'll cost them jobs . 
  however , there 's no shipyards in canada that can even build a warship currently , so there 's honestly zero potential for lost jobs . 
  but , the shipbuilders are going to win the fight , and they 're going to get the contract , and then in 5 years they 're going to say they need more money because they do n't have the infrastructure , and it 'll end up with canada spending almost double on a class of warships that 'll be outperformed by warships from europe that would of been cheaper to buy . 
  such is canadian military procurement though ... 
  holy shit , another person from the city of oaks on / r/europe ? 
  any single nato state in europe , yeah , but combined , they 're way more powerful . 
  weapon system | russia | nato europe | | : -- | : -- | : -- | fighters | 808 | 1600 + tanks | 2500 | 3000 + aircraft carriers | 1 | 5 attack submarines | 39 | 57 awacs | 23 | 39 none of that includes us assets in europe either . 
  outside of bernie sanders , trump 's actually the least trigger happy candidate . 
  * ted `` lets carpet bomb syria '' cruz * hillary `` i voted for iraq and i laughed when ghaddafi was killed '' clinton * marco `` war with iran is the only way to prevent an iranian nuclear weapon '' rubio i 'm by no means a trump supporter , but he 's not a war hawk . 
  nah man , bulgaria is where viktor krum was from in harry potter ... 
   also , there is a fairly large turkish-american population whose opinions of greece should n't need to be explained there 's between 200k-500k turkish americans . 
  there 's between 1.3m-3m greek americans ... any sort of negative opinion by turkish americans would be overwhelmingly shadowed by those of the greek americans . 
  most american resentment towards greece ( and there 's very little to begin with ) is due to their economy , and their military ties to russia . 
  but again , both of those have no * real * meaningful effect on the us population 's view of greece . 
   though beyond france and britain the other major eu militaries of germany and italy are far more impressive on paper then in a major conflict . 
  to an extent . 
  the weakness of european militaries are their logistics , and forward capabilities . 
  no one in europe has a military designed to fight a serious war anywhere outside of their national borders , but luckily for them , usaf has a massive cargo presence in germany/italy/spain , and it 'd only take the [ usaf amc a few hours to send out the fleet from charleston to assist . 
  ] ( http://www.wtot.org/military-photos2_files/image023.jpg ) and then there 's the usaf 's fighters already stationed in europe to add to the mix . 
  * 480th fighter squadron ( f-16c / d ) * 492nd fighter squadron ( f-15e ) * 493rd fighter squadron ( f-15c / d ) * 494th fighter squadron ( f-15e ) * 510th fighter squadron ( f-16c / d ) * 555th fighter squadron ( f-16c / d ) with all the additional aircraft on deployment to incirlik afb , ramstein afb , etc. 
  usaf has more combat aircraft in europe than most nato allies have in total ...  nato forces would require a major build up to drive an entrenched russian force out the baltics . 
  russia would n't have time to entrench itself in the baltics ... 
  it 's forces would be under attack non stop . 
  also , to keep any kind of serious pressure in the baltics , would take the vast majority of their logistics capabilities , creating vulnerabilities for them on every other front that would undoubtedly open up . 
  yes , nato would have to build up for a ground campaign to retake the baltics , but the russian forces there would be a shell of what the initial invasion force was after the air campaign that would undoubtedly cripple their military forces there . 
  the biggest worry for nato forces would be russia 's air defenses , and even then , all you need to do is deploy adm-160s spoofing whatever aircraft signature you want , and you 'll find their batteries . 
  from there , it 's simple missile targeting with tomahawks from long range . 
  after that , even legacy aircraft like the b-52 can engage the ground forces ... people do n't understand that russia 's military is honestly overall , a generation behind their western counterparts . 
  they have current generation hardware like the t-90 / pak-fa/su -35 s , but they 're not produced in any sort of credible numbers because they just ca n't afford it . 
  while a generation does n't sound like it should make that big of a difference , it really does . 
   ru-af starts flying 4 + th generation fighter escorts backed up with a world class aa system ? 
  lol russia using 4 + gen fighters ... you mean 2000s built jets still using 1980s era pesa radars . 
  being modern built does n't make them a 4 + gen fighter in the slightest bit . 
  the brand new modernized su-35s ' are russia 's first 4 + fighters . 
  the next 4 + for russia is the mig-35 , which is still years out from operational status . 
  unless we 're saying f-16c / ds and f/a -18 e/fs are 4 + , since they 're at the same tech level ( f/a -18 e/fs are actually using aesa radars now , but we 'll ignore that ) ... russia has a fleet of 3rd and 4th gen fighters , with a handful modernized to 4 + gen. 
  adding any forces to eastern europe is viewed as a declaration of war in russia 's eyes ... we ca n't really * do * anything for eastern europe , except offer them discounts on hardware , like the ex usaf f-16cs and c-130s we sold to poland for rock bottom prices , or the ex german army leopard 2 tanks poland bought for rock bottom prices . 
  that 's the most we realistically * can * do , with russia right there . 
  shit , a couple months ago russia was accusing the joint naval exercise baltops threatening and a provocation of war , even though they 've ** been ** to baltops annually since the fall of the soviet union . 
  a couple months ago , a few strykers rolling across eastern europe as show of force to our eastern european allies was viewed as sabre rattling , and provocation of war , like 10-15 strykers are going to be able do a damn thing to russia . 
   i also am skeptical that the us would shoot down an mi-8 that passed across , say , alaska unless us air defense believed that it posed a threat or there was a belief that it was russian national policy and russia had been doing so intentionally and warned norad commander general victor e. renuart , jr has openly stated that the us will ** never ** allow a foreign military aircraft to violate our * territorial * airspace , and anyone who attempts to do so , will be engaged with lethal force . 
  not advocating it , but if you 're flying a military aircraft , you have to know where you are , or you ** will ** be shot down if you violate a nation 's territorial airspace . 
  if it 's just their adiz , yeah , they 'll wave at you and tell you to fuck off , but not territorial airspace . 
  all rand 's wargames stated , is that nato ca n't keep russia from surging through the baltics , and that 's always been known . 
  nato forces are overwhelmingly in the uk , france , germany , and italy , not the baltics . 
  it 's always been assumed that russian forces could easily take the baltics in a surprise attack , because in order to prevent it , we 'd need essentially the nato presence in germany moved to the baltics , which would basically be a declaration of war in the eyes of russia . 
  exactly ... 
  to be honest though , civilian causalities has never really been a major concern of the russian military . 
  as long as the overall objective is completed , that 's all that matters . 
  i mean , look at grozny for example . 
  the most destroyed city on earth after the chechen wars . 
  things like the [ grad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt7nrearyfg ) were used extensively , even though they 're not precision weapons . 
  well , dwb do n't use traditional hospitals , they use whatever structure is available in the area , which can lead to all sorts of problems . 
  for example , you 're taking heavy fire from a building right next to the dwb facility . 
  do you : a. potentially get shot , just to verify one 's a dwb facility and is n't the one shooting at you b. order an airstrike on the building you believe it 's coming from , while you remain covered now imagine you 're in a region that 's been dominated by an `` us vs them '' mentality for decades . 
  which one do you do ? 
  you do b , because you 're getting shot at , and you do n't care if the wrong building got targeted , because it 's them , and they should n't be there anyways . 
  also , afaik , there 's no real russian forces mixed in with saa/ypg forces . 
  they 're simply just radioing in targets and the russian air force has at it . 
  might not have been a signature strike , could of been shitty intel/targeting plots given by saa/ypg fighters . 
  it 's rare in a modern and well trained military , but it happens , like when a us jtac called in an airstrike on his own position ... but for a 3rd rate fighting force like the saa/ypgs , absolutely a possibility as well . 
  / u/nounhud is n't trying to say they accidentally hit that particular target . 
  they 're saying they deliberately hit that target , but they were mistaken on what that particular target was . 
  ksa and israel ** are ** allies ... 
  they 're just not openly known allies ... helps they 're both heavily against iran 's expanding influence in the region .
