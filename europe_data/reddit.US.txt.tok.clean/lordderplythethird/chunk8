  also , since when does '' ** association ** '' ( your own word ) , mean '' ** alliance ** '' ? 
  i never said pkk/pyg are ** allied ** with saa , i said they 're ** associated ** , and gave clear and concise proof as to that , since you said they were n't in association , which is clearly and factually wrong . 
  and a ton of training and support to the peshmerga , prepping them for the campaign on mosul . 
  which , is coincidentally why there were turkish forces in iraq , causing the iraqi government to throw a major temper tantrum ... because the iraq government still cares more keeping the kurds from breaking away/becoming empowered , than they do the fight against isis . 
  the assad family openly allowed the pkk to use syria as a staging ground for attacks on turkey for decades ... only changed back in 1999 with the signing of the adana agreement , under the threat of war from turkey . 
  until then , the pkk 's leadership lived openly in damascus lol even then , the ypg forces ( allied with the pkk mind you ) that turkey recently attacking in syria , were working with the saa to retake a military base back from fsa fighters ... that 's a pretty close association man ... 
   fun fact , we invented the apple pie americans always claim as being so quintessentially american . 
  huh . . til . 
  i just always saw you lot as cheese obsessed lol you can have $ 20 . 
  too bad your dutch . 
  if you canadian , you 'd basically be a millionaire with all those tim horton dollars after the conversion : /, 
  pyd have been accused of war crimes by everyone excluding themselves , the pkk , russia , syria , and the us . 
  plus , while amnesty has received criticism , it does n't deminish the integrity of the evidence they provided , including images of christian villages completely razed to the ground , far from the front lines , deep within pyd territory . 
  the assyrians and armenians in particular , have been ** extremely ** vocal , even going so far as to say the pyd has treated them the same as isis has , leading to quite a few assyrian protests across the globe . 
  https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing-of-villages-amounts-to-war-crimes/ http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tensions-soar-between-syrian-kurds-and-christians-1646831127 http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_syrian-christians-accuse-pyd-of-unlawfully-seizing-property_403602.html  my daughter went to school and was taken from there by a group of ypj , '' a father of a 14-year-old girl near qamishli said . 
  `` we knew nothing about her until a ypj commander called and informed us that she had joined ypj . 
  https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/07/10/syria-kurdish-forces-violating-child-soldier-ban-0  yes , the aim is to create a at least semi-autonomous state in northern syria , unaligned with the pkk uhhhh , the pyd is literally the syrian branch of the pkk ... 
  it holds kongra-gel as their own legislature , and abdullah \u00d6calan as their leader ... you simply ca n't have a pyd that 's not alligned with the pkk ... 
  so what you 're saying , is simply not true . 
   all of the kurdish fighting groups turkey has attacked are fighting isis and not all kurdish groups are being attacked by turkey . 
  the one it 's not , is n't the one accused of war crimes , forced conscription , child soldiers , etc. 
  just because they 're currently fighting isis ( although the pyd fights the fucking fsa just as much as they fight isis ) , does n't really mean anything . 
  pyd are n't offensively attacking isis , all they 're doing is driving them ( and everyone else not aligned with the pyd for that matter ) from lands they view as theirs . 
  past that point , they do n't venture . 
  also , pkk are n't fighting isis . 
  they 're too busy threatening to murder politicians in turkey if they do n't announce their support for an independent kurdish state within turkey . 
  but , that 's expected from a group like the pkk ...  . 
  there is also a persecution and suppression of the kurds as an minority group within turkey . 
  yes , decades ago . 
  sure . 
  sure . 
  no there 's not . 
  for all erdogan 's failures as a leader , he 's done more for turkish-kurdish relations than everyone before him . 
  pkk is still fighting against an oppression that no longer exists . 
   correction - barzani loathes these groups . 
  he 's also not the most reliable fellow , who has no vested interests . 
  seriously ? 
  the most proven criticism is that he was the owner of a well off business ? 
  that means he 's not reliable ? 
  seriously ? 
  oh , and look at that , the rest of the criticisms come from the syrian kurds ... how about that . 
  yeah no , you 're going to have to do ** a lot ** more than that , to try and say he 's a `` not the most reliable '' lol the vast majority of the people on / r/kurdistan , live in fucking europe and have never been to kurdistan . 
  their families fled during the 90s to avoid saddam ... yeah , some anonymous people on a webforum would * neeevvveerrrr * lie rofl . 
  yeah , those comments are gold . 
  `` he 's done nothing for kurdistan '' `` well , he 's done a lot for kurdistan '' k.  who exactly believes this ? 
  after the war is over , they will have to make sure that there is no external infiltration of the elections by turkish government , russian or us governments . 
  uhhhhhhhh everyone ? 
  i know your a syrian kurd national ( ist ) , but dude ... it 's pretty god damn blatantly obvious what the pyd is doing ...  are you joking ? 
  there has been a major influx of radical turkish users since the downing of the su-24 , which downvoted anything that is n't negative about kurds , pkk or not . 
  lol , yeah okay man . 
  the `` fuck turkey . 
  i hope russia nukes them . 
  that 's what they deserve for killing the kurds and supporting isis ! '', 
  circlejerk was rampant . 
  not sure what you 're talking about , but it certainly was n't reddit . 
  i 'm not even a turk , and i found it fucking ridiculous . 
  i always praise you guys !, 
  dutch and norwegians were by far my favorites to work with and hang out with during unified protector . 
  many an apple pie was shared with you lot !, 
  uae were weird , turks were rude as hell , and the french had their stupid sexy short shorts, 
  yup . 
  eu 's combined gdp rivals the us , which , if they would just agree that they ca n't all have all their own military programs , they could take advantage of . 
  $ 80b r&d for something like the f-22 is ** a lot ** of money . 
  more than france , uk , germany , etc could afford on their own . 
  but combined , yeah , it becomes something far more feasible for them to undertake . 
  same goes for warships . 
  uk 's type 45s are amazing ships , but $ 8.5 b is a lot of money . 
  if they had shared out the type 45s with the rest of europe , the r&d costs would have been much less for the uk , and they could have afforded more than just 6 of them . 
  ** but ** , on the other hand , you have massive corruption problems like with the eurofighter typhoon program . 
  should have been fairly cheap , with the uk , germany , italy , and spain all funding it ... but each country just * had * to have their piece of the production pie , so not only was development and production heavily delayed , but overall costs were inflated by 75 % , and they 're still not even fully done , as they 're waiting on their aesa radars still ... 
  that 's only true to a certain extent . 
  a large amount of the munitions used on uk/french aircraft , especially air to ground , are us weapons . 
  rafales heavily use gbu-12s , gbu-22s , gbu-24s , and gbu-49s for example . 
  their sbu-38s , sbu-54s , and sbu-64s are domestic versions of the gbus , but they can use either . 
  the same 's true for the uk . 
  tornados heavily use agm-65s , gbu-24s , paveway iis , etc. 
  they have their own paveway ivs and brimstones , but that 's really it . 
  same 's true for the typhoon . 
  sure , when the uk runs low on brimstones they have to retool the factory because they have an idiotic concept of munitions control , but that does n't mean they ca n't simply get agm-65s from the us , since they 're essentially the exact same thing anyways . 
  the problem is though , both want to prove they 're a strong and independent military power , so they just * do n't * ask to loan out weapons , even though , if we 're being honest , they 're not strong and independent military powers anymore ( outside of their nuclear arsenals ) ... but no one in europe is , but everyone thinks they are , and they all have their own programs for tanks/missiles/aircraft / helos/guns/etc to prove how strong and independent their militaries are , but it very blatantly comes at the price of not being able to perform operationally at any credible tempo . 
  netherlands knows they 're not a military power and do n't try to have all sorts of independent programs ... but by doing so , they can at least operate their military at a level that seems almost superhuman compared to the nations surrounding them . 
   however europe is both disgusted by assad , and making only ceremonial gestures in the bombing campaign to prove how sad this is , the netherlands , with its 61 combat aircraft , is about to overtake france and its 280 combat aircraft in total strikes against isis , and is closing in on the uk pretty fast . 
  uk and france should be ashamed , while the netherlands should be ** highly ** praised , but that 's not the case . 
   europe supports turkey with monies , and turkey helps isis by decimating any significant kurdish gains . 
  not exactly true ... you 're lumping all kurds together , but that 's not the case . 
  turkey 's been a major supporter of the peshmerga ( iraqi kurdistan 's military ) . 
  they 've trained and armed peshmerga forces for the fight against isis . 
  turkey is n't fighting kurds in general ... they 're fighting the pkk , a terrorist insurgency organization that even kills fellow kurds for crimes such as selling bread to turks . 
  they 're also now lightly attacking the pyd , which is the syrian branch of the pkk , because the pyd provides shelter and refuge for the pkk . 
  also because the pyd 's armed forces , the ypg , are destroying entire villages if the inhabitants are n't kurdish , are directly responsible for dozens of massacres in northern syria , force conscripting children they kidnap , and are trying to create an independent state in northern syria allied with the pkk . 
  it 'd be like if a breakaway part of the mexican military were fighting the drug cartels while trying to carve out a state in northern mexico for al qaeda to operate from for attacks on the us . 
  at that point , yeah , you 're going to bomb all of the above , because fuck all of the above . 
  even iraqi kurdistan fucking loathes the pkk and pyd , but has agreed to work with the pyd for now against isis , under the terms that the pyd ** must ** allow open and free elections when the war is over , but many believe the pyd will never do so out of fear they 're removed from power . 
  but , [ there 's a lot of pkk apologists in europe , especially in germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkwwaeeycge ) , so those facts will get downvoted , because how dare anyone talk ill about the pkk . 
  that 's the f-16 's refueling port f-16s can only be refueled by booms like [ this ] ( http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/design/refuel/boom-receiver.jpg ) , over the drogue and probe refueling systems like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/helicopter_aerial_refueling.jpg ) . 
  the difference is that the probe and drogue is easier , and there 's more platforms that can serve as refuelers , buttt the boom can refuel an aircraft far far faster . 
  f-16s went with boom refuels , so that they could be refueled faster , so they could return to the fight faster . 
  those lines , show the [ boom operator ] ( http://media.defense.gov/2014/nov/18/2000953554/-1/-1/0/141021-f-jp000-001.jpg ) where the refueling port is essentially .
