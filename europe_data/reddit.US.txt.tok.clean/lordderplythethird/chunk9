   the german society never bought into the logic of deploying military force abroad . 
  never !, 
  too bad , you 're in nato . 
  if estonia was to be attacked , you 're obligated to show up to their defense . 
  as is , you ca n't . 
  point blank . 
  i 'm sure germany could ship men and equipment via rail for the first few hours , before the rails are targeted . 
  after that , the german military becomes a giant 25b eruo paperweight . 
  contrary to what so many people in germany seem to believe , nato is n't just to benefit them . 
  you either do what you need to do , in order to be able to protect the allies you said you would and be able to participate in the * military * alliance you 're a part of , or germany can get the fuck out of nato like france did in the 1960s , and do its own thing . 
  but nato is ** not ** something that exists just to protect germany if germany 's ever attacked . 
   germany is heavily invested in the nato e-3 squadron in kaltenkirchen . 
  given the taboo of offensive military operations this satisfies our needs for such airborne c2 . 
  ehh , not really . 
  it 's almost exclusively us personnel ( currently got 3 friends at the command ) , with a lot of help from the dutch . 
  germany helps , but they do less than the dutch do . 
  and even then , if the constitution prohibits awacs via `` preparation for and conduct of wars of aggression '' , then why would the german navy have 6 unrep ships ( more than anyone in europe outside of the uk ) , designed to keep ships fueled and supplied on long ocean voyages ? 
  why does germany have multiple electronic warfare ships meant to park of an enemy 's coast to listen to their electronic chatter ? 
  that 's pretty much the definition of cherry picking ... we ca n't have this because our constitution says so , butttt these things that essentially perform the same logistical and intelligence purpose are totally okay . 
   what needs to be said , however , is that they have n't seen much of an update over the past decade and especially the harm armament gets a bit long in the tooth why is why at this point , they do n't even count . 
  sead fighters need constant updates , not really to weapon loadouts , but the electronics . 
  aa and vulnerabilities constantly change . 
  a decade old software , is absolutely useless and essentially does n't even serve a purpose . 
  \\  it actually reeks of a country which does n't face ( = perceive ) a direct military threat while at the same time has considerable negative associations to all things military . 
  you know why the us military returned to high levels of manning in germany after they reduced when the cold war ended ? 
  german military begged them to , because the us would invite the german military onto their bases , and essentially give them training for free , because the german military was n't given funds to fucking train itself like it needed to . 
  that , is 100 % political incompetence . 
  there 's literally ** zero ** excuse , to have a 25b euro a year military budget , in one of the wealthiest nations on earth , and your fucking armed forces have to beg a foreign nation to come back , just so they can get free training . 
  none . 
  none what so ever . 
  right now , i have a buddy in the us army doing a training exercise with the german army who were sent to his base for it actually . 
  nato exercise where we practice hunting submarines ( useful in defense too ) . 
  guess who 's essentially the only nato country with asw ( anti submarine warfare ) assets not to show up , even though it 's just in italy ? 
  germany . 
  even canada can manage to get one of its ten working cp-130s across the pond for it . 
  shit , the broke ass greeks sent a submarine to be used as the target . 
  france brought their fucked up helos , but at least they brought something . 
  uk brought only a couple helos , but they brought a ton of comms people to practice working with non-brits . 
  but alas , nothing from germany ... 
  it 's so god damn fucking frustrating to see the german population go `` estonia 's being attacked ? 
  welp , sucks to be them , we do n't want to help them !, 
  oh shit , ** we 're ** being attacked now ?!, 
  america come help us please ! '', 
  knowing it 's my fucking life that 's so eagerly being invited towards death , when they 're not willing to do the same . 
  that 's not a military ally i want . 
  germans should be fucking ** ashamed ** of that , but instead , it 's a badge of pride , because a competent military means you 're going to take over the world . 
  there 's apparently no middle ground of a strong military to assist allies and defend your interests if absolutely needed . 
  there 's only incompetence , or literal 1930s nazi `` we 're taking over the whole god damn world '' germany . 
  only 2 modes that exist for a military apparently . 
  and considering the german military is woefully and completely incompetently set up , it 's desperately needed . 
  * 4 strategic transport aircraft for a 170,000 + man force is pathetic . 
  that 's enough to get maybe 1000 troops somewhere and constantly supplied . 
  what 's the rest of the 58,000 german army going to do ? 
  practice shooting their brooms ? 
  * zero awacs to give those typhoons a mobile , long range radar platform to help it protect hundreds of square miles at any given time . 
  * zero sead fighters to take out an enemy 's air defense network so forces can push forward . 
  * 4 refuelers , which is enough for a single squadron of fighters or so , going off the golden military rule of 3 ( 1 available of every 3 at any given time ) * navy 's actually pretty well together , though generally suffers from a lack of firepower against surface targets honestly , as someone who worked at a nato command , if i had to pick just one , i 'd bring italy with me to war over germany any day of the week ... they 're simply put , one of the most well put together militaries in europe , and germany is one of the poorest put together ones . 
  it reeks of incompetence at the hands of politicians who think they know what the military needs better than the military itself . 
   there are nato members with far more robust economies/locations far more removed from russia than poland who are doing absolute dick about their nato obligations cough cough ^ ^ germany ^ ^ and ^ ^ canada ^ ^ and ^ ^ their ^ ^ less ^ ^ than ^ ^ 1 % cough cough, 
  able to do more and more with less people thanks to automation , and personnel costs alone make up over 25 % of the dod 's budget . 
  the destroyers of today are akin to the cruisers of wwii for example , but a modern destroyer has around 300 personnel , while a wwii cruiser had 1200 + a b-29 of wwii required a crew of 11 , while the b-2 takes just 2 . 
  a midway aircraft carrier could only carry 50 aircraft , but had a crew of over 4000 . 
  a nimitz aircraft carrier carries around 90 aircraft , with a crew of roughly 5000 . 
  automation 's saved the us military ** a lot ** of money ( factoring in inflation of course ) . 
  how is it a big deal there ? 
  p-3s have been in iceland since the 1960s . 
  even when the usn base closed in 2006 , we still sent p-3s there all the time , to operate as a deployed asset . 
  i worked with p-3s in iceland from 2009-2013 when i was the communications watch officer at ctf-67 in sicily , the nato command in charge of all asw operations around europe and africa . 
  all this is , is the military saying `` that hangar we use for our p-3s when they 're deployed there ? 
  we need to upgrade it for use with the p-8s . '', 
  that 's literally all they 're saying , and all they 're doing . 
  nas keflavik is n't `` reopening '' , it 's an icelandic coast guard station now , and the most important thing there , nrtf keflavik , is operated by iclandic local nations , and has been for well over a decade , and they do damn good work . 
  never had a problem any time i had to get in touch with them . 
  no one is going to be stationed in iceland , and the base is n't opening up ... 
  they 're upgrading a single hangar they have there , for aircraft that occasionally get stationed there ... 
  literally , 2nd and 4th paragraphs of the article :  the service is asking for funds to upgrade an aircraft hangar at its former base in keflavik , iceland , as part of the defense department 's fiscal 2017 budget request , according to navy officials . 
  the hangar will house the p-8 poseidon , successor to the sub-hunting p-3 orion once stationed at the base . 
   the navy now routinely sends p-3 's to keflavik from its air base in sicily to patrol for russian subs in the north atlantic , a navy official said . 
  the p-8 will fill the same role once the hangar is updated with new wiring , flooring and a rinse station , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to speak on the record about the project . 
  this is completely false . 
  what you stated , is the roe if they violate what you deem your adiz , or air defense identification zone . 
  adiz are still considered international airspace , so you have no legal authority to shoot down an aircraft in your adiz . 
  your territorial airspace , is a completely different situation , and you absolutely can shoot down any foreign military aircraft that violates your territorial airspace . 
  that 's why norad 's commander said the us will absolutely not allow a violation of its * territorial * airspace , and any aircraft that does , will be immediately engaged . 
  that 's why the tu-95s and the like that you read about off the coast of california are n't being shot down . 
  they 're staying outside of the us ' territorial airspace . 
  the second they cross that threshhold though , they 're being put in the ocean . 
  there 's no adiz along land borders , because where my territorial airspace ends , yours begins . 
  there 's no room for an adiz . 
  i can monitor all the air traffic in your country along my borders if i choose , but i ca n't send up a fighter to intercept an aircraft about to breach my territorial airspace , if it 's in fact your territorial airspace . 
  this is what seperates the russian incidents in the baltic sea , off the coasts of california and alaska , and the su-24 shot down by turkey . 
  you do n't fucking violate a sovereign nation 's territorial airspace , or you ** will ** be shot down . 
  simple as that . 
  you can do whatever the fuck you want in their adiz , but the second you cross that threshold , you become a hostile target , and they will fucking shoot your ass out of the sky . 
  [ turkey 's report to the un ] ( http://live.aljazeera.com/event/turkey_downs_russian_jet/207503335 ) 1 aircraft violated airspace and immediately turned around , the other violated airspace and kept going ( this is the su-24 that was shot down ) . 
  2km over 17 seconds , is around 450kmph ... that 's above the stall speed , but not by a whole hell of a lot . 
  450kmph translates to 7.5 km per minute , or .125 km per second . 
  multiply .125 km by 17 seconds , what do you get ? 
  gasp , you get 2.125 km ( just under the 2.19 km the jet traveled . 
  off by a little bit by using 450kmph instead of the actual 463.873 kmph or whatever it was , but 450 was a simplier number to use .
