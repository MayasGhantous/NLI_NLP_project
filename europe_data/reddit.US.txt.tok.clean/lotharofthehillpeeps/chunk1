i ca n't help about the shape i 'm in  i ca n't sing , i ai n't pretty and my legs are thin  but do n't ask me what i think of you  i might not give the answer that you want me to, 
  i 'll just put [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/48rl01/redditors_who_have_completely_dropped_your_old/d0m28jm ) here . 
  this thread has been pretty buried though . 
  imo the main advantage of the us vs. europe is purely practical . 
  50 little countries , one language . 
  i wonder how * you 'd * sound if you were on the most popular show in your country and the host was asking you if you would consider leading your country ;-), 
   it 'd be like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner . 
  badass analogy in and of itself, 
  the us is with russia on this one germany , stop being psycho . 
  pull yourself together man, 
  so the curved croissant is simply mocking turkey ? 
  nice, 
  only time i 've seen that word used outside jabberwocky . 
  its a good one too , should be used more often, 
  you just have to tell people you 're not interested in talking about politics mostly , which in many ways is really a shame , but how else to respond when a person hears your american accent , comes right up to you with no introduction and says something like `` russia is the most powerful country in the world '' ? 
  imagine the kind of nonsensical political discussions i had while living in germany the last six years . . almost everyone who wants to talk to you about politics is just like this guy, 
  i could tell from a mile away / fitpantsonymonkey _ was going to be like that , which is why i just cut my interaction off with him/her, 
  what 's up with your attitude ? 
  sounds like someone wants the gravy train of that sweet sweet american taxpayer money to keep on flowing to europe . 
  ca n't say i blame you , for you its free money and great schools , for us its shitty schools staying shitty . 
  i did n't read it , because your tone is accusatory , not polite , and i have no interest in being yelled at . 
  ( i.e. 
  why would i care about what a german thinks about the presidential race in my country ? 
  your opinion on the matter is irrelevant where i am concerned ), 
  c'mon man , you write that a sanders victory  would not only lead to a further destabilisation of the world but also further fuel future economical wars with no sources to back up your wild claims ( about the * future * no less ) , and you want me to take you seriously ? 
  you 're using the word economical wrong for starters ;-) edit : btw * every * german says economical instead of economic , they must teach it that way . 
  so many times i did n't have the heart to correct . 
  ooookay * walks away slowly, 
   he would be abolustely devestating to the european - american relationship in many ways . 
  in what ways ? 
   this is because we do n't live in a world anymore where the people of europe are going to allow our militarises to start invading and causing perpetual war the way the us does , so there is no need to have that capability ` at hand ' , since there is no significant external threat to europe right now . 
   russia certainly is n't that and russia 's leadership fully knows that . 
  til ukraine is n't european . 
  what an incredibly unprofessional thing to say by oettinger ( whoever he is ) . 
  full cringe . 
  who elected this guy to repre -- oh yeah , nevermind . 
  thanks for the clarification on sanders ' foreign policy stance . 
  sorry for idiots like him , living in europe off their father 's wallet ( and buying drugs with their parent 's money by the way ) . 
  after having spent six years in germany , i know the type , and in any event , poland is the future of europe . 
  you guys are doing a lot of things right . 
  do n't worry about these spoiled ami brats , their opinions are meaningless . 
  they 're all locked in safes and it is n't fashionable to bring up the topic in normal company . 
  my point was that germany is far too weak , everything else being equal , to do anything without the us - whether germany wanted to or not . 
  i think germany needs to start taking its own security more seriously - germany 's dismal , sickly defense budget and the refugee crisis are but two of many indicators of this . 
  we want to be your bros , but its tough to be bros with some old lady who 's coughing all the time and goes to bed at 21.00 every saturday night lol, 
  my comment was a counter-factual , to clarify what i mean . 
  and what i mean is that in a world of a disinterested us , german government chambers might look a lot like [ this ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_unity_party_of_germany#/media/file%3abundesarchiv_bild_183-1986-0417-414%2c_berlin%2c_xi._sed-parteitag%2c_er%c3%b6ffnung.jpg ), 
  you will * never * get five or ten countries to agree on a common foreign policy ( much less 28-30 ) , it would be gridlock , and as the eu is condemned to unanimity in csdp/military and civilian mission voting which will not change , its actually very easy to say ` never ' ( especially after you research this stuff in depth for awhile and you fully understand the issue more or less of the impossibility of an eu army or some such nonsense sorry !, 
  merkel actually has not much business at the munich security conference . 
  all security experts globally are aghast, 
  i agree with you there !, 
   what service is austria enjoying again ? 
  til for austria the cold war ended in 1955 edit : also , austria enjoys many us-provided global public goods ( outside of nato 's remit in any case ), 
  german 's style of political debate , is if you disagree with their position , than they say that you want to do nothing . 
  they force you to then respond '' you 're mischaracterizing my position , that 's not what i said '' . 
  then lord knows what kind of tangents you get into . 
  arguing with a german about politics is worse than arguing with a woman . 
   what would be the benefit of not talking to russia anymore ? 
  who is saying we would n't talk to russia anymore if we do n't do things ` the german way ' ? 
  can germans do anything talking about me politics except regurgitate russiatoday talking points ? 
  its actually against austria 's constitution to join * any * military alliance . 
  you guys are among the worst of the european freeriders , you do n't even pretend to try . 
  if the us truly stayed home ( which was my counter-factual point ) , there 's not a chance that germany would stand up militarily - and die - for estonia . 
  if you think pacifism does n't have its extremely suspiciously convenient side , i got a bridge for you . 
  another way to look at it is america 's militarism is the number one factor which enables germany 's feel-good love and dope pacifism . 
  that pacifism in-turn fuels german anti-americanism , as if we fucking have any choice except being militaristic . 
  and its especially clear now in the age of putin and isis what kinds of forces are out there that the us is trying to stop from taking over the world by force . 
  and all germans can ever do when talking about the us is talk shit . 
  its so disheartening/ironic . 
  that 's the main reason i left germany after six years - everybody ( the vocal majority seemingly anyway ) in germany thinks the us is the greatest force against peace in the world . 
  its crazy they were so honest to pollsters that this truism is documented in the population . 
  and they 're not shy to tell you either . 
  so if germans get to say a bunch of falsehoods about the us constantly , pretending we live in la la land utopia and like russia would n't steam-roll germany if given half a chance , than i can express my opinion too . 
   this is why germany 's actual allies suspect that should little green men ever show up in the baltics , berlin will set up another normandy-like format rather than mobilize troops . 
  in a world of a disinterested us , if the baltics were invaded by ` little green men ' , germany 's individual response would be to do absolutely nothing . 
  if anything germany might even join russia . 
  who would think any differently ?

   only saying very broadly that economies with large public sectors can prosper i would disagree with that ( sorry ! ), 
  so now suddenly you 're a fighter for the cause and fate of bosnia ? 
  you were n't yesterday . . 
  i disagrere on the comparison . 
  big difference between 30 % and 60 % . 
  30 % of the workforce working in the public sector is probably close to a ceiling . 
  its never good to extrapolate the scandinavian countries as case studies , regardless . 
  denmark is not the same as bosnia !, 
  sweden \u2260 europe . 
  i 'm talking about one , you 're talking about the other . 
  and privatized education and healthcare is n't what i 'm referring to anyway . 
  i 'm talking about shrinking the size of the bloated european welfare state ( i know many germans who just do n't work because receiving arbeitslosgeld is their ` right as a german ! ', 
  the european economy will never thrive with so many such people , and such a philosophy ) . 
  europe is well known for muddling through ( look at the eu-nato relationship , for example ) if you want europe to thrive , you have to basically become america jr. 
  otherwise all this welfare , high taxes , anti-capitalism etc. 
  will always keep europe down under its full potential ( whether we like it or not ), 
  ha no worries !, 
  do n't take me so personally jeez man . 
  well anyway this stuff has already been said a thousand times before , so i 'll just refer you to john mearsheimer ( [ why is europe peaceful today ? 
  ] ( http://www.palgrave-journals.com/eps/journal/v9/n3/full/eps201024a.html ) ) and for example the article ` come home america ' [ e gholz , dg press , hm sapolsky . 
  come home , america : the strategy of restraint in the face of temptation . 
  * international security * , mit press ] ( https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3072048755777857886&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,50&amp;sciodt=0,50 ) there 's nothing i could say they have n't and you 're attacking me so i 'd better leave,
