  you 're really into science innit ? 
  which is all part of the tragedy i referred to, 
  at first i thought this was a reference to u/dragon , who seems to have made his user profile the day reddit opened and has n't been seen since . 
  one day , the dragon shall awake , but until then , he sleeps in restful slumber, 
  i do n't like it any more than anyone else , but that 's the way i see it . 
  the inevitability of a russian backlash is very clear to me , and i explained why . 
  i can give sources as well . 
  i do n't however appreciate being sworn at for explaining my beliefs . 
  i did n't say they did . 
  but how can you deny that the eu extending the aa with ukraine would 've necessarily resulted in armed russian aggression of one sort or another . 
  even little kids in mexico knew that . 
  the signing of that agreement was an obvious foray into the realm of great power politics , and that is a realm of tragedy . 
  and the eu is / was in no way prepared for that . 
  which , actually , was neuland 's point . 
  its a distasteful truism , whether i like it or not . 
  and whether i like it or not , russia has power and ukraine * is * within its small sphere of influence . 
  the idea that the eu could sign the aa with ukraine and russia would not retaliate militarily in some way is laughable . 
  in the [ linked ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3v4vj4/young_white_people_are_losing_their_faith_in_the/cxl1wk0 ) article ` do n't come home , america ' , the authors go quite in depth into your point . 
  i do n't think we should abandon our posts , i just more take the point of the authors of the other linked article ` come home , america ' that we should downsize our international military footprint ( 5-10k stationed in de and sk ) , and i agree with mearsheimer , walt , posen , preble , pape , etc. , that we should take the position of [ ` offshore balancer ' ] ( http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/almost-triumph-offshore-balancing-6405 ) . 
  you well meaning stinker . 
  pfft nice writing too you probably do n't even know the difference between using ` and ' an ` an ', 
   the land is not sentient what about earthworms ? 
  check mate . 
  this is absolutely key . 
  comments section . 
  i think ya 'll are missing the ramifications , this is pretty big, 
  china seems more like its testing how far it can go ( like a normal country ) , rather than making a go . 
  still , they 're at least a small threat just by default . 
  where on the continuum i 'm not sure anyway . 
  the way i always look at it is , if you could look through some bizarre-o lens , and somehow see this crazy counter-factual world , where america was where germany is and germany had the same exact situation america has , the ` germany ' of this bizarre-o upside-down world would have a foreign policy much like that of the us . 
  certainly , if germany somehow had never fought the wars and came up like denmark , germany 's foreign policy would be active in the same way america 's is today . 
  my 2 cents, 
   ukraine has made clear for over two decades that they are seeking closer ties to europe . 
  do you realise you 've given up the goose here ? 
  do you realise that what you 're saying is that the eu is the party most responsible for the coup and the resulting war in russia ? 
  you 're admitting , that 1 . 
  the eu knew what a risky proposition it was to solidify official eu-ukraine ties , due to possible russian backlash 2 . 
  the eu waited at least twenty years ( more ? ), 
  due to this possible backlash , and that 3 . at some point last year , someone in the eu ( who ??? ), 
  gave approval ( aka decided ` fuck it !, 
  ' ) , took a jump into the dark , and ` the eu ' signed the [ ukraine-european union association agreement ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement ) . 
  that was a huge choice . 
  russia 's possible retaliation should have been foremost on evrerybody 's minds . 
  they should 've signed that agreement sweating and seeing dark clouds on the horizon . 
  signing that agreement was practically signing an official declaration of war between ukrain and russia , on ukrain 's behalf . 
  but nobody seemed to notice , either the day last year when the agreement was signed ( putin told europe countless times that if it went forward with it he would retaliate ) , nor after war broke out , how responsible europe was - all they could talk about was victoria nuland . 
  you prove with your comment that the eu just gave nuland to the european masses to distract them from the eu 's own culpability . 
  why else would the eu have waited so long vis-a-vis ukraine, 
  [ humanitarian aid in haiti ; 2010 earthquake ] ( http://www.navy.mil/gallery_search_results.asp?terms=6006s&amp;page=3&amp;r=4http://www.navy.mil/gallery_search_results.asp?terms=6006s&amp;page=3&amp;r=4 ), 
  there are basically only minor differences between the us and europe i 'd say , nothing major, 
   baconflavored butter * knee shaking intensifies *, 
  sure , but i know that today the south korean military is a force to be reckoned with in their own right after so many decades of such a close military relationship with the us . 
  i think they could handle the dear leader themselves in the worst case scenario , and the us would pretty much always have their back no matter what ( i.e. 
  5k troops stationed or 50k ) . 
  50 years is just my educated guess on the floor . 
  maybe the us is in europe the next 100 or 200 years , but we 're not leaving totally germany in 25 years or something ( ! ) . 
  we 're actually in the planning stages of a [ replacement ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/11/world/europe/landstuhl-hospital-to-be-replaced-but-with-what.html?_r=0 ) hospital for landstuhl currently , to be built closer to ramstein . 
  my point is to accept that we 'll be there then to ask what the smallest number of us personnel are then required . 
  certainly not 30 , 20 , or even 10k . 
  5k i could live with . 
  and i support that the pivot to asia includes repositioning 60 % of the us navy to the pacific , strengthening ties to countrires such as japan and vietnam ( the philippines to an extent , definitely singapore etc. ), 
  but i do n't think we need 50,000 troops in sk to stare down the china threat either . 
  for example the us will not before at least 50 years who knows hand over landstuhl regional medical center , or even ramstein afb ( why would we ) . 
  they require many thousands . 
  so in the case of ger we 'll have a troop presence next 50 years no matter what . 
  unless germany asks us to leave , of course , but i do n't think they will in the next decades . 
  so if i accept that fact , i can then say that instead of zero , maybe 5,000 . 
  south korea , maybe the same . 
   china is becoming more assertive by the day . 
  i do n't really see this . 
  china is 5,000 years old , they move slow in int ' l politics . 
  and remember the great wall of china ? 
  they do n't really want conquest which leads to hot total war , they just want to not be invaded and humiliated . 
  their threat is a bit overblown . 
  their threat is more in economics . 
  we should take ` most ' of our troops home from ger and south korea and become an offshore balancer , for one . 
  you can [ research ] ( http://beta.foreignassistance.gov ) what the money was spent on if you wish .

  turkey is n't leaving nato . 
  i take your point , but my point still stands, 
  i 've heard the $ 1-2b number a lot during the last few months , not just from this article . 
  do you think daesh has ten bucks ? 
   yes you can which is , to an extent , sam harris ' [ point ] ( http://www.samharris.org/free-will ) about free will . 
  ( though he 's not really talking about this being a conscious process or conspiracy or whatever , like its just the way it is . 
  i think orwell was talking more about the possibilities of adding deliberate manipulative cultural programing to something like harris ' indeliberate cultural programming . ), 
  of course , the case is overstated for effect , that erdogan and his family are directly involved ; yet , i 'm not sure * anyone * could squeeze $ 2 billion out of just the current economies of syria and iraq through the black market selling * anything * . 
  the first two , not worth total war , but the * third * . . 
  i do n't understand / europe sometimes . 
  just because you read an author does n't mean you have to subscribe to their views , and the point seems to be that she 's not worth taking seriously , with no real reason given . 
  i would disagree with that . 
  i think this is more just bleating on and moaning about murica ( i.e. 
  sucky system ) on / europe than someone making a point with actual substance . 
  imagine, 
  are you working on any slavic legends that are specifically bulgarian ?

  dan brown is an excellent writrer . 
  ( imo ) those 80 pages are quite brilliant , and are the centerpiece of the book . 
  it sold 8 million copies but / europe does n't like it so its shit .
