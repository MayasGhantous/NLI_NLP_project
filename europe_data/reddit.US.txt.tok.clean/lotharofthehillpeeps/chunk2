  are you done ? 
  your bad english slang is too much for me right now ( mate eh ), 
   or maybe we 've been through an era of horrific war everybody has been through an era of horrific war . 
  we are vastly overspending , thats my whole point . 
  we do n't need to be subsidizing europe 's security in the expensive ( to us ) way we are , when acting as an offshore balancer would be roughly just as effective . 
  what the fuck are you talking about, 
  your posts are all so personal like you want to beat up everyone on the internet who even slightly disagrees with you , you 'll probably respond very harshly to even * this * post, 
  europeans basically think things like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/43tdvn/us_to_quadruple_military_spending_in_europe/czkyxyk ) while seeming to be certain the us will always put up with it . 
  that 's why this article 's title is news - its like the first time somehow that europe is finally certain the us wo n't solve its problems for it . 
  americans are finally starting to realize how much europe has been taking advantage of us and laughing at us , how much us taxpayer money is directly subsidizing european security with zero thanks , and i hope that this is the end of the era of freeriding europe . 
  we 'll see in another decade or so i reckon . 
  last year the us spent $ 70 billion in military/defense/security r&d , and germany spent $ 500 million on the same thing . 
  why should the us care so much about europe 's security , when it seems like europe does n't care about its own security ? 
  i wonder if the munich security conference was picketed/protested against ? 
  you spent your entire saturday night on r/europe yelling at people ...  . <, 
  man you 're cringey, 
  he 's talking about the latest craze in the us for americans to actually physically throw british tourists underneath metro buses . 
  how many downvotes have you collected on r/europe today ? 
  i think what / europe is trying to tell you , is that  you can kindly fuck off but ^ that 's ^ none ^ of ^ my ^ business, 
   the us becomes a scapegoat for problems within the eu immer mehr non !, 
  yeah but you could just as easily write  ~ ~ america ~ ~ every country in the world has no permanent friends or enemies , only interests . 
  unless you think that countries like france , germany and the uk are permanent friends . 
  i suppose that 's debatable . 
  kissinger was just referring to america because that was his point of reference ; he was explaining his policy recommendations to the american public at that time . 
   like many of my relatives nobodyherecares.jpg, 
  cool story bro, 
  oh have n't you heard ? 
  merkel let one and a half million sunni muslims into germany last year , thousands more coming every day . 
  mostly men . 
  yeah crazy i know . 
  and yelling akbar is just what they kind of do , especially once you get em going \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  i stopped reading after `` the globalists . . '' these kids these days think they have it all fingered out, 
  got ta love you some of them liberal institutions - they tell you what to think , when you ca n't trust yourself to have the politically correct opinion of the day . 
  merkel 's chances of becoming the head of the un seem to be running on track, 
  step 1 . 
  unilaterally tell millions of sunni muslims that germany will take them in . 
  step 2 . 
  after a million come , dictate to poland and other slavic countries they have to take enourmous number of refugees . 
  step 3 . 
  yeah right you * know * that after four budweisers last night manning passed out at 11pm, 
  but u/vertikal19 does n't agree . 
  and he 's super non-racist . 
  so you lose , sorry . 
  * this post has been submitted to r/shitamericanssay *, 
  tomorrowland ? 
  that 'd be insane . 
  kill it, 
  buses would be a lot cheaper than trains . 
  that would cost you like $ 1,000 if you bought the tickets day of , so that 's the most expensive option . 
  dude , you should look up music festivals , and plan your entire trip around them , instead of just the touristy vanilla thing . 
  they 're called goa festivals ;-) ps definitely have your hostels booked before you arrive in a new city w / clear directions as to how to get there, 
  yeah i 've only heard this story 11 times so far, 
  you 're my new favorite poster on / europe , / u/butt _ phd, 
  better throw him in the gulag, 
  you 're so unaffected and above it all , your sarcasm on reddit is really attractive wow, 
  this is what happens when you form policy around the opinions of 20 year olds . 
   depending on assumptions , these costs could reach 3-4 billion euro per year . 
  for the schengen area as a whole , this is not a dramatic figure . 
  however some countries like slovakia and luxemburg would be harder hit . 
  on top of that would come the extra cost for the many personal and business trips in europe . 
  according to eurostat , about 200 million trips to another eu country take place per year . 
  the costs could even double . 
  so you mean to tell me , that 1 . 
  the us just quadrupled military spending in europe to $ 3 billion/yr . 
  ( with the german reaction being especially meh ) , while 2 . the value of shengen in and of itself is at most $ 8 billion/yr ? 
  i think poland will emerge as one of europe 's most relevant countries in the 21st century actually . 
  you guys are doing a lot of things right . 
  yeah i remember srreing that in the nrws a month or two ago . . until you realize that the restraint shown by the us and russia during the cold war , with respect to nuclear weapons , was incredible . 
  but you do n't know what you 're talking about , so how can you be convinced of anything regarding such issues one way or the other ? 
  go to christiania , it 's dope !, 
  where 's ja ? 
  and every year you [ send ] ( http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20130522161858254 ) 10,000 of your best and brightest , with all that european book learnin ' straight into the welcoming embrace of murica * thanks * ;-) edit : if you just wrote this a few days ago though u/romeneverfell :  you 're the laughing stock of the world , whenever one thinks about who 's dumb , racist and does n't know shit about any subject they think about the americans . 
  i wonder why the best educated italians move to the us ? 
  in 2015 , the us spent $ 65 billion on r & d , while germany spent $ 500 million, 
  anyway that 's why the most important debate in ir for americans is that between [ come home , america ] ( https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3072048755777857886&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,50&amp;sciodt=0,50 ) and [ do n't come home , america ] ( http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/22595/dont_come_home_america.html ) , or the future direction of us grand strategy . 
  [ here ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wjz4i8akx4o ) is a great debate between one of the authors of ` come home , america ' ( daryl press ) and one of the authors of ` do n't come home , america ( william wohlforth ) . 
  press et . 
  ( more realists ) believe that the us should take the role of ` offshore balancer ' and reduce the annual defense/intelligence budgets to something like $ 400-500 billion , while wohlforth et . 
  ( more liberals ) believe that the current defense/intelligence budgets of ~ ~ $ 800-900 ~ ~ $ 650-700 billion is fine - and actually a good deal considering everything the us gets for that expenditure . 
  i agree with press et . 
  and i think its a crime that the us spends so much . 
  i want word to get out that it does n't have to be this way . 
  look at the possible savings over the next 20 years between those numbers . 
  just sent my district selectman an email ( a pic of a dumb looking cat , but still the communication aspect is important ), 
  with how many times that gif has been posted on reddit , i 'm surprised it still works, 
  * reported, 
  it has to do with making inroads towards reducing the defense budget . 
  and spending $ 400 - $ 500 billion a year instead of $ 800 - $ 1000 billion a year over the next twenty years ( gasp ! ), 
  adds up to real money . 
  we could pay off the national debt . 
  it 's not just about this single case . 
   - all things considered , the us should be paying more than double germany and france combined  - but europe is n't the usa 's home !, 
  that 's like , uh , a really good point, 
  do n't worry about this poster , early 20 's german girl is a confirmed troll, 
   no one is forcing you to pay for it . 
  but you still do and bitch about us making you pay . 
   thanks , us . 
  it 's a sweet deal this attitude is why trump has so much support - americans are mad that people around the world just laugh at the us and our ` deals ' with them which benefit them more than us, 
   the fact we 're not proves that europe has no real taste for big wars unlike the rest of the world ? 
  ( apart from isis etc ),
