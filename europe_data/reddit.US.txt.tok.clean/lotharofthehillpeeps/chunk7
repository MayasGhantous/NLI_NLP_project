  i like israel , because things like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms3nnrs1sjs ) happen there . 
   they urged to preferably wound and disarm a perpetrator so he can still be taken into custody and put on trial . 
  the company behind the taser gun is attempting to move into europe . 
  my prediction is that in a few years , you 'll start to see stun gus carried by many police in germany in the next few years . 
   but they let him leave still armed . 
  they did n't arrest him ? 
  ( my translation ) ** `` most were ` freshly traveled ' asylum seekers '' ** * police take issue with the stance given by their leadership that the identities of the perpetrators of the chaos during new years eve were unknown . 
  most of those controlled were syrians . 
  their main purpose was `` sexual amusement/entertainment '' . 
  * key statements previously given by the chief of police in cologne regarding the sexual assaults during new years eve are apparently/obviously untrue , as reported to the `` welt am sonntag '' by police who were there ( on duty that night ) . 
  officers defended themselves against the allegations made towards them by thomas de maiziere ( cdu ) during his recent address to the cologne police . 
  cologne 's chief of police , wolfgang albers , said on tuesday : `` we do not know who the perpetrators were , who were robbing and sexually harassing women '' . 
  the cologne police told the `` welt am sonntag '' that they actually did ` control ' ( * any time a person has to speak with law enforcement , give id etc. , in germany they call this ` being controlled ' * ) and partly arrest many individuals . 
  as such , it actually was known to the police from which groups the offenders came . 
  `` as opposed to statements made by officials , we knew quite well the background of those '' taking part in the chaos outside the hauptbahnhof and domplatz . 
  roughly 100 individuals were controlled by law enforcement ; many had been arrested and taken into custody . 
  up until now , the chief of police has not informed the public that police had arrested and taken into custody a number of alleged perpetrators . 
  according to the information obtained by the individuals that night , the cologne police reported further : `` only a small minority were north africans , the majority of those controlled and arrested were syrians . '' such information came from their documents . 
  so far reports had indicated that those involved were young men with a north african background , as they have been known to police regarding petty crime problems for over a year . 
  but many of those controlled by cologne police that night had been in germany only for a few months . 
  `` most of them were ` freshly travelled ' asylum seekers . 
  they presented documents ( to police when controlled ) which are issued at a certain point during an asylum application . 
  the recording site then provides a copy of the asylum request and photo back to the asylum seeker . 
  apart from this , there is another point which contradicts information given by officials regarding the new year 's eve celebrations . 
  officials had stated that the primary purpose of the perpetrators that night was to steal ; the sexual harassment was incidental . 
  `` in reality -- it was the exact opposite , '' cologne police informed the `` welt am sonntag '' . 
  the arabic offenders went out that night in order to commit sexual offenses ; frankly , for their own sexual amusement . 
  a group of men would circle a female , enclose the circle around her , and assault the victim . 
  ** internal paper from january 2 also contradicts albers ** not only do statements made by regular police contradict police chief albers -- but also a six page `` debriefing '' paper internally circulated within the cologne police force on january 2 . 
  the `` welt am sonntag '' was provided with a copy . 
  the internal presentation is clearly in contradiction with albers ' statements . 
  from the paper , it is also clear that a majority of the perpetrators were asylum seekers : `` according to personal details provided to police by those arrested/controlled , the vast majority of those arrested identified themselves to police as asylum seekers of the federal office for migration and refugees , and possessed no other identity papers . 
  according to the internally-circulated police report from the second of january , on new year 's eve between 10pm and 5am , 71 individuals were controlled , 11 individuals were brought into custody and brought into custody , and 32 criminal charges were made by police in cologne . 
  in addition , four arrests were made . 
  the data was documented by the cebius-system of cologne law enforcement headquarters . 
  ** nordrhein-westfalen police association : `` no doubt refugees among the perpetrators '' ** arnold plickert , chairman of the nordrhein-westfalen police association ( gdp ) , defended the police to the `` welt am sonntag '' : `` the police/out colleagues in cologne feel as though they have been 100 % unjustly attacked and put in the stocks by interior minister de maiziere and his allegations . 
  it is simply wrong to say that the police had n't made any arrests or brought any individuals into custody the evening of new year 's eve . '' plickert also took issue with the statement made by officials that alleged perpetrators were not controlled with no personal information given to police . 
  `` according to the information provided to me , there were at least 80 cases of individuals having been either controlled , arrested , or taken into custody . '' plickert also staunchly defended the officers of cologne law enforcement who spoke with journalists about the reality of what happened on new year 's eve : `` i can completely understand why our colleagues in the cologne police force came forward in an anonymous manner in order to provide the public with accurate information , as there has been widespread misreporting throughout the media and they felt the need -- not only to defend themselves -- but to clean up the public record . 
  indeed - some officers i have spoken with have told me in confidence that they felt as though it were * them * viewed by the public as being the guilty ones ! '' the gdp state chairman went on to say : `` i consider it an outright falsehood that there had been no indications that recent refugee seekers were indicated as having been among the perpetrators . 
  many of those controlled that night provided police with documents from the federal office for migration as identification . 
  it is certain that asylum seekers/refugees ( fluechtlinge ) were among the perpetrators . '', 
  this part actually made me kind of angry , like ` oh well these things happen all the time ' . 
  no they do n't . 
   the violence on new year 's eve was not different from any other big-scale celebration in the city , according to tanja . 
  `` because refugees are now a burning topic , the media all of a sudden report about these events , but what nobody wants to admit is that these things happen all the time . 
  ** i 'm sorry to break this to you , but german-born men also harass and rape . 
  thanks debbie downer !, 
  ( my translation ) *** `` they were like an army '' *** the ` horror night ' from cologne as experienced by a hotel doorman ** by 7pm it began : `` groups of 6 , groups of 10 , groups of 12 , all from northern africa . 
  i 've never seen anything like it before , '' said ivan jurcevic . 
  `` they looked to me like an army . '' ** jurcevic has been a bouncer/doorman since 1989 . 
  on new year 's eve he guarded -- as during previous years -- the entrance to cologne 's hotel excelsior . 
  it is located just west and within sight of the famous cologne dom . 
  `` they were walking around with bottles of beer and schnapps in their hands . 
  most were already drunk/wasted , '' he recalled afterwards . 
  ** `` come with me ! '' ** the trouble began immediately . 
  hotel guests who were smoking outside the hotel entrance were accosted : `` give me a cigarette ! '' they demanded . 
  `` come with me ! '' they said to women . 
  at the same time peter erkelenz was walking around the cathedral square with his wife . 
  erkelenz 's brother is the cdu-councilman martin erkelenz , and calls himself an `` original cologner '' . 
  erkelenz reported that he was surprised at the amount of arabic-speaking young men present . 
  the voices were aggressive . 
  erkelenz was worried and left the area of the dom quickly with his wife to the party they were invited to . 
  at 10pm , the situation at the cathedral square ( domplatz ) escalated further . 
  there were firecrackers and rockets flying into the crowd . 
  bar owner paolo campi observed the buzz from his `` art bar '' , situated to the east of the cathedral . 
  `` absolutely anti-social , '' he says . 
  `` on new year 's eve the area around the dom is always filled with anti-social behavior . 
  whether it was worse this year , i can not tell you . '' also , he could n't confirm if it were especially arabic people from north africa around the dom or not . 
  meanwhile , the situation as experienced by ivan jurcevic in front of the hotel excelsior was going from bad to worse : two young women running from north africans came to him pleading for help , he said . 
  ** `` it 's not a good idea to screw around with me during an emergency '' ** the men pursuing the women came up to the doorman -- an experienced martial arts trainer -- and threatened him . 
  `` i am 6 feet 5 inches tall , and weigh 285 pounds . 
  i 'm not a good person to fuck around with , '' says the otherwise calm and friendly jurcevic . 
  when the men who had been pursuing the two women then attacked jurcevic , he kicked one of the men and then retreated ( with the two women ) back into the entrance of the hotel . 
  the other pursuers moved forward . 
  `` i kicked one of them in the chest and he flew ten feet . 
  that was the first moment there was silence '' , said the native croatian , who has lived in germany for the last 40 years . 
  the attackers then threatened him : `` we will come back and kill you ! '' they called out to him in english . 
  at this time , the directorate of the hotel excelsior had already asked guests not to smoke in front of the hotel . 
  guests were now standing on the first ( second ) floor watching what was happening in front of the cathedral with eyes wide . 
  ** rioters were beating one another ** meanwhile , hundreds of riot police had been assembled . 
  jurcevic can at this point clearly see that they are being bombarded with fireworks ; the task forces seem to be afraid . 
  after midnight : in front of the hotel , there were beatings and assaults happening everywhere . 
  jurcevic witnessed a knife attack . 
  the alleged arabic north africans appeared to be attempting to track/hunt down black africans from countries south of the sahara to beat them . 
  the rioters brawled amongst themselves . 
  right before jurcevic 's eyes , one was beaten unconscious with a bottle . 
  when the attacker began to step on/kick the head of the unconscious man , jurcevic and another bouncer from a bar next door intervened . 
  ** no time for arrests/charges ** policemen came . 
  the attacker was arrested -- and later released because all police vans were completely overcrowded . 
  after the attacker was let go by police , he spit on the front of a police car . 
  `` fuck the police ! '' he screamed in jurcevic 's face . 
  jurcevic then lost his nerve and beat the man to the ground , he says . 
  at 1:30 am , peter erkelenz returned to the cathedral square with his wife from the new year 's eve party , wanting to take the train home . 
  but the s bahn station at the central train station is locked . 
  at this point , a uniformed female police officer was standing directly in front of erkelenz and his wife . 
  suddenly , a man jumped from behind the police officer , stuck his hand in her uniform jacket pocket and then tried to escape . 
  she pursued him and wrestled him to the ground . 
  she yelled at him , but that was it . 
  for arrests to be made and charges to be filed , the chaos is too large ; there are too many fires going on for officers to fight all at the same time . 
  erkelenz also learns why the s-bahn was shut down : rioters were running on the rails , attacking passengers , and were having fun running from police .
