  the s-bahn was therefore shutdown . 
  erkelenz left the chaos with his wife , taking the tram . 
  ** will nazis plan to take revenge on foreigners ? 
  ** `` i 'm really afraid '' , said erkelenz . 
  `` also of what could happen during carnival . '' the assaults only abated between five and six o\u2019clock in the morning . 
  the chaos finally came to an end . 
  just a few remained . 
  meanwhile ( in between ) , women began to make reports to the police that they were assaulted . 
  one woman reported being raped . 
  many women did not go to the police right away , having first gone home in shock . 
  the time to file charges ( ? ), 
  expires on tuesday . 
  few alleged perpetrators have been arrested . 
  meanwhile , as reported by leftist groups on twitter , neo-nazis have expressed desire to soon gather in cologne , to hunt for north africans . 
  jurcevic has himself also heard that there could be such or similar actions . 
  the cologne police must likely expect to prepare themselves for new disasters . 
  i was at the [ soul kebab ] ( http://www.yelp.de/biz/soul-kebab-hamburg ) at the hamburg zob a few weeks ago during a 15 minute bus stop/change while travelling , this was right after the recent attacks in paris , and the main guy working there was talking with a tv remote in his hand ( i.e. 
  shop owner ) to an older guy ( who was sitting on the other side of the counter ) in turkish watching the coverage . 
  the television was showing footage of the stadium , and the main guy working there to the older guy on the other side of the counter , started laughing , talking turkish , made a ` boom ' sound emphasized with his hands , and started laughing again . 
  i stared them both down , but whatever . 
  i 'm not sure you 'll see much sympathy from the turkish population . 
  u/heknarf was being rhetorical . 
  its clear to everybody that you 're out of your depth here . 
  you were n't even being asked a question , yet you responded as though you were, 
  what do you want me to say , guy from california ? 
  you get fingerprinted at the auslaenderbehoerde when you apply for a year-long or two year-long visa . 
  i certainly did . 
   i 've yet to really find anything good about the us life here . 
  [ i agree ] ( http://www.iisg.nl/exhibitions/censorship/images/mc-kurt.jpg ), 
  [ oh really ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jx57xpaiky ), 
  volkswagen cars are n't pure junk , but your posts on this thread sure are . 
  john mearsheimer said that a good question to center a ir phd dissertation around , would be the question of whether europe would assist the us in its ` china policy ' ( e.g. 
  the balance of containment and engagement ) and its ` pivot ' towards asia , or whether europe would simply stay home , trade with china , and get rich ( and thus allowing for china 's rise at a much faster pace ) . 
  i do n't know the answer . 
  maybe someday after you ditch the eu , we could become friends . 
  friends who ride majestic , translucent steeds , shooting flaming arrows across the bridge of hemdale . 
  your comment is irrelevant , it was made minutes ago . 
  we 'll always be here if you want us uk !, 
  ok . everybody 's got an opinion . 
  yours is n't any more valuable than anyone else 's . 
  you 're just a mean person is basically all i can see which separates you from most of the rest . 
  authoritarian leftism ... 
  i think what 's really bothering you is you 're not happy with your own life and you take it out on / europe . 
  write another novel . 
  edit : you 're on reddit at literally 5am-6am on a sunday night/monday morning posting . 
  what ? 
  - you did n't even sleep on sunday night and just stayed up throwing barbs on reddit ? 
  delusions of grandeur much ? 
  than you do n't understand the issue, 
  brazil ? 
  is that a typo ? 
  i agree wholeheartedly . 
  i find it distasteful how people on this board try to discount friedman . 
  he 's brilliant - and one of the few people with the cajones to actually * make * predictions , many of which have turned out to be accurate . 
  robert kaplan , one of the greatest current writers in the english language , works with george friedman . 
  i 'd rather throw my hat in with friedman and kaplan , rather than 25 day redditor / u/obotxobot . 
  did you really make a sub named after yourself ? 
   80 million germans died in the war . 
  it was great, 
  that makes a lot more sense !, 
  i lived there for a few years, 
  you 're really going to keep your car after that ? 
  do n't you understand that / u/rok182 is * angry * at you for it ? 
  this is why the neorealists say that it should 've been nato that got the nobel peace prize , not the eu . 
  one point that is n't really made so often for reasons of germany 's brutality , was that ww2 was going to happen whether hitler instigated it or not ; stalin was getting ready to invade europe and germany . 
  it was a crazy time . 
  anyway , do n't come on here talking about america 's greatness and what not , you 're not saying anything that has n't been said a million times before and you just come off as a dick . 
  but you have to admit , a driving license costing $ 1200 in germany is a nice way for the government to earn some scratch , too . 
  there are some positives for that pricetag , but the german gov ' t is n't running a charity , either . 
  edit : these schools are non-government subsidized . 
  can i go to your place and party tomorrow night ? 
  there 's too much wood panelling here . 
  i ca n't make it any clearer buddy , a properly functioning military which consists of two or more countries is impossible . 
  europe ? 
  what 's that ? 
  actual first person experience ? 
  here 's a downvote / s, 
  this is the first time i 've seen the argument that since india is a nation , the eu can federalize . 
  this entire conversation is basically a way of saying `` how can we prove neorealism wrong ? '', 
  neorealism says that it is the nation state that 's important , and liberal institutionalism says that it is institutions that are important ( constructivism focuses on identity ) . 
  the eu is a supranational institution , and with the problems caused by forces of nationalism during the 20th century in europe and how they led to war , and because nobody wants war , some europeans thought they could overcome the nation-state , and therefore overcome war . 
  and that 's why its a [ ` tragedy ' ] ( http://www.amazon.com/tragedy-great-politics-updated-edition/dp/0393349276 ) that neorealism is right . 
  if you want to find out how the world really works , i ca n't suggest anyone better than [ john mearsheimer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_mearsheimer ) ( along with [ stephen walt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stephen_walt ) ) . 
  they 're both neorealist theorists , mearsheimer being an offensive neorealist , walt a defensive neorealist ; they agree on most points . 
  after years of studying this stuff , i could n't find anyone apart from these two academics who explained international politics better . 
  as an example , check out [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_israel_lobby_and_u.s._foreign_policy ) book and all the controversy it created . 
  they are not popular in europe , for reasons such as neorealism being pessimistic , nation state-centric , and concerned with questions such as survival , rather than the thriving of a society ( they would say geopolitics trumps economics , or that you ca n't have economics without first taking the security and defense issues off the table as it were ) . 
  they would say that it was not the eu which deserved the nobel peace prize , but that it should have gone to nato , as an example . 
  they would likely say that the democratic peace thesis is wrong , because it is non-falsifiable ; no democracy would call the country it is going to war with a proper democracy like it is . 
  there 's more to say , but when i found out about these guys , it was like a bomb going off in my head . 
  finally , everything made sense , instead of things always being twisted around like a pretzel . 
  in conclusion , they 'd likely say the dream of a properly federalized europe is a waste of time , and your time and personal political philosophy would best be spent elsewhere . 
  oh , one last thing - they 're just as harsh on the us as they are on europe !, 
  i live in the midwest . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  edit : nm , op lives in iowa . 
  big difference between small town iowa and chicago . 
  than why would you clearly write  we have them in truck stop ( lorry petrol stations ? ), 
  bathrooms . 
  that 's about it .
