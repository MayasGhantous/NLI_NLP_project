  in canada , while most spending is done at the provincial level as they handle the tasks mentioned above , there is substantial funding transfers under the canada health transfer , canadian equalization payments , and canada social transfer . 
  these transfers are calculated to ensure that , for the purposes of each province 's tax system , it is as if each province has a similar set of canadians with the same incomes . 
  essentially it levels out any differences in income . 
  ** under a canadian-like fiscal union ** , the eu would take money from richer states and give this money to poorer states so that they get the same income as if their citizens were rich citizens . 
  i agree that the us and canada should be the starting point for any fiscal union design for a federation such as the eu . 
  but you are wrong that they are not fiscal unions . 
  the us and canada are representative of fiscal unions . 
  because you ca n't just look at how financial decisions are made , you have to look at how the money itself acts . 
  while the us system looks very spread out , most spending in the us occurs at the federal level . 
  most welfare/health care/social security/retirement/etc is coming from federal spending , so the system is representative . 
  ** under a similar us-based eu fiscal union ** , imagine if the eu ran a federal version of the nhs and all state pensions were run by the eu , as well as a majority of the welfare system , with greeks and brits getting the same welfare amounts . 
  in canada , while most spending is done at the provincial level as they handle the tasks mentioned above , there is substantial funding transfers under the canada health transfer , canadian equalization payments , and canada social transfer .

  it 's similar but canada also has an extremely beefed up version of the eu cohesion funds that transfer money between richer and poorer provinces . 
  i would go with this as well , actually . 
  if we beefed up the eu cohesion fund , we could allow poorer states to more easily manage their rapidly increasing health care and other costs that come with joining the eu . 
  this would reduce the impact of greek troubles and also help the eastern eu states that are poorer and are dealing with increased costs . 
  the opposite happens for canadians in the us . 
  their wallet fills up with bills and it seems like you are rich . 
  to a lesser degree simply because the usd is made out of linen instead of paper . 
  but it 's still crazy expensive , which is why the us made a ton of us dollar coins but nobody is willing to use them without being forced to . 
  at the same time . 
  the us pays enormous amounts for pennies . 
  each penny is worth around 3-5 cents in copper . 
  theoretically you could choose to not be part of your country . 
  i think there 's a difference between being proud of * being born * in your country , and being proud of your country . 
  i think it 's probably more like north kosovo . 
  this is why most have just gone to lebanon or jordan or turkey . 
  but there are opportunists which take these horribly dangerous boats with their families . 
  well i think the largest problem is that a startling amount of migrants appear more interested in moving for economic reasons than for actual freedom from persecution . 
  hence we end up with migrants at calais , or skipping over hungary and italy altogether in general on their way to germany or wherever happens to have the cushiest deal for refugees/asylum seekers , and has the highest income potential . 
  i agree . 
  there 's a common border policy already but the enforcement is lacking . 
  i think there needs to be an eu level border police at this point . 
  i agree , but i do n't think border control between schengen countries is the answer . 
  just means italy is stuck with 'em . 
  wow ... 
  it 's unbelievable that they wo n't allow an investigation after insisting for so long that it was kiev who did it . 
  it would be far cheaper and more efficient from a human perspective to allow them to move somewhere else , or for them to build defenses against climate change . 
  we can do that with ease , and unfortunately we will have to do it . 
  stopping climate change is actually literally impossible at this point . 
  we are in for at least 2-3 degrees celsius of warming over the next 100 years even if we stopped everything now . 
  hell , i 'm from florida originally . 
  my home state is going to get a shit ton of flooding . 
  but look at the netherlands , they 're already quite more well prepared than say , louisiana . 
  and yet all of these people can move to other areas easily , but it 's still cheaper for them to stay put and build defenses . 
  it is total bullshit . 
  climate change in general is going to be massively disruptive but it 's not going to be anything we ca n't deal with . 
  it 's far more harmful to wildlife than to us . 
  that map looks really out of date and/or wrong for a number of countries . 
  regardless of the reasons i am considering the merits of a pride march through an area that is anti-lgbt in general . 
  which is the whole point of pride . 
  therefore i think any arguments about it being provocative are sad . 
  as a member of the lgbt community , as much as i think this is provocation of the muslim community , i am reminded that provocation is the whole point of the pride parade . 
  yeah , but it ca n't be re-inforced against a specific minority group quite as much . 
  like others have mentioned here , could be from balkans or anywhere . 
  i actually think this allows the police to better do their jobs . . 
  the problem is that a lot of these people would n't be accepted by embassies and so they 'd go by boat anyway . 
  as it is currently people can apply for relocation through the un , which is basically the same thing , and be referred to countries . 
  they do n't get accepted , so they resort to boats . 
  yeah . 
  nyc gets twice as much rain as london but it 's not a constant drizzle over days . 
  to be honest i find it really weird to say that the baltic states are central europe . 
  the only thing further east is russia . 
  they 're certainly part of both eastern and northern europe . 
  no i mean he would say that to her, 
  obama would complain about how others are trying to demonize her and force her to leave her new home and that politicians need to do the right thing and pass x bill . 
  probably not actually . 
  it would have been very very condescending instead . 
  something about how if she works really hard maybe she 'll be able to come back like everyone else that has to work hard . 
  i think he 's being sarcastic but i have no idea . 
  with regard to most jurisdictions i know of , you must be provided with a receipt if you request one . 
  it 's not required that they always give one . 
  it 's really only good if it 's being used to support the poor and stupid . 
  ( school grants , etc ) it works fine as long as it would be happening anyway . 
  they would immediately push a re-design and re-issue of eu banknotes and disconnect the eu banking system from greece . 
  it 'd be expensive but pennies compared to the damage greece could cause . 
  yeah . 
  that is pretty much what goes on in my head too . 
  lol, 
  go through my comment history maybe ? 
  it should become quickly obvious that i care about the actual situation in greece and that 's where most of my ambivalence comes from . 
  how does one prove that they are n't an sjw ? 
  i do n't even see what the point would be in being an sjw . 
  i honestly do n't care about your fake and dishonest response . 
  yeah . 
  i get that . 
  i did n't realize so many places do n't take cards there . 
  here it is always surprising when a place does n't at least take debit . 
  i can understand that too . 
  in the us/canada that is often the case , but most people pay by debit/credit now . 
  you will however sometimes see the odd grandmother paying by check in the us , which is even more bizarre . 
  i can understand that if they do n't have a chip & pin machine you might be ambivalent towards potential fraud . 
  i 'm not an sjw . 
  i just think it 's absurd that where a serious discussion should be had about a run on greek banks instead we are having a discussion about the nice bum of a woman in the picture showing , more importantly , that even greek mps are pulling their money from banks . 
  this is n't a guy 's night out at the bar . 
  this is a relatively public place and i see it as disrespectful towards women . 
  that was the point .
