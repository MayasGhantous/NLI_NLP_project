  that 's what they believe . 
  so what ? 
  why is that so much worse than being opposed to * capitalism * ? 
  why do people have to mischaracterize them as wanting to `` destroy europe '' ? 
  leaving the eu is not `` destroying europe . '', 
  that 's because you 're swedish . 
   far-right want to destroy the europe thank you for this unbiased analysis, 
  i do n't see how doing any of those things would make you a moral person . 
  if something is n't immoral , why would n't it be acceptable ?

  got it . 
  oh really ? 
  so for decades muslims in the netherlands were forced to go to dilapidated schools that purposefully were n't funded properly because the government viewed muslims as inferior beings ? 
  is that what happened ? 
   the claims relate to the district of schilderswijk , about two kilometres from the city centre , where an almost entirely muslim population of some 5,000 people surrounds the el islam mosque , fuelling criticism that the government has failed to ensure a proper ethnic mix in schools and local housing . 
  what is `` a proper ethnic mix '' ? 
  racism ?

  you do n't have 10 years . 
  you need to act now . 
  complaining about your leaders bringing in this group of people who fucks everything up is not `` racist . '', 
  if every swede knows this , then it should be easy to solve the problem . 
  you should send all the foreigners back . 
  or somewhere else , at least . 
  you should n't have to deal with them . 
  they hate you and they hurt you and they take advantage of you and your prosperity . 
  you deserve to have leaders who like you and care about you . 
  who put your interests first . 
  you do n't have that right now . 
  you have leaders who tell you that swedes `` have only a history of barbarism . '', 
  that sweden `` belongs to the immigrants . '', 
  that is not what leaders do .
