u mad bro ? 
  the thing that makes me proud of europe today is that nobody in this thread mentioned the usa ( so far ) . 
  german ingenuity ? 
  whatever happened to good old german orderliness and obedience to authority ? 
  i wonder if that would be enough to sooth the spanish ego . 
  that 's what you get for trying to spell stuff in english . 
  sucker !, 
  i do n't know how to respond , because this seems like a complete non-sequitur to me . 
  the idea that pepe the frog is inherently racist , because it was used in a racist meme by someone . 
  or that he is used only by `` far right activists '' . 
  the casual conflating of `` alt right '' , `` far right '' and `` trump/brexit supporter '' . 
  citing a racist french guy and a racist pepe meme as emblematic of `` the great meme war '' . 
  the sinister background music . 
  the ominous narration throughout . 
  this is total bullshit propaganda . 
  it 's sad what the bbc has become . 
   then leaving without having established a new , solid government and as a result destabilizing the region . 
  the sad truth is that as long as there 's a chance a democrat will be elected president in the near future , it is foolish to rely on non-treaty u.s. military commitments that extend farther than the current presidency . 
  the burdens of leadership . 
  suck it up , germany . 
  i never said `` linux is communism '' , do n't put words in my mouth . 
  communists do invariably support linux , though , and anything else that is an alternative to a `` product of capitalism '' . 
  it is n't . 
  it just goes to show that if you want good software , you have to pay for it . 
  it 's not free . 
  that 's because huge sums of money are paid to people who work on the kernel . 
  i 'm talking about linux software more broadly . 
  if it does n't have anyone who is paid to maintain it , then generally it 's crap . 
  linux is in no way innovative . 
  it was conceived as a copy of unix that runs on cheap hardware . 
  ever since , it has focused its energy on implementing `` free '' versions of already-existing commercial software . 
  as for reliability and user-friendliness , do n't make me laugh . 
  android has google overseeing it . 
  that 's why it 's reliable and user-friendly . 
  other linux distributions , not so much ... 
  you mean ( evil corporation ) google 's android operating system ? 
  there 's a reason open-source software is n't reliable , user-friendly , or innovative . 
  it 's because nobody 's career depends on it . 
  sorry communists , if you want good software , you 're going to have to put up with the free market in this case . 
  pretty cool engineering project . 
  condolences to the taxpayers . 
  perfect . 
  - globalists, 
   similarly , we might ask what iraq had to do with , say 9/11 ( hint : nothing ) -- yet the is invaded iraq as retribution for 9/11 . 
  or we might ask what , say , sikhs ( who 've routinely been the victims of `` anti-muslim '' violence '' have to do with islam . 
  both of the above statements are false , but it 's not necessary to argue about it , because i accept your point :  the takeaway is , of course , that folks are willing to irrationally generalize their anger if they 're feeling particularly aggrieved . 
  sure , fine . 
  but what can * sweden * do to prevent stuff like this from happening in their country ? 
  or are you one of the ones who thinks they should just `` accept the new normal '' ? 
  on the contrary , now that we 've identified the problem , we can deal with it . 
  that 's an optimistic outlook . 
  it 's only when we wring our hands helplessly and refuse to recognize the problem that we are really hopeless and pessimistic about the future . 
  please enlighten me as to how sweden has oppressed muslims , given them `` legitimate grievances '' . 
  how has sweden of all places caused this `` retaliation '' . 
  i mean this is * sweden * we 're talking about . 
  for a to cause b , a has to chronologically precede b. 
  you apparently ignorant of history . 
  muslim terrorism did n't start when the un ( not the us or nato , mind you ) created the state of israel . 
  they will always be able to find `` legitimate grievances '' to justify their atrocities , and there will always be `` useful idiots '' in the west who believe them . 
  * yawn * yeah , the terrorism is all our fault . 
  muslims do n't have free will . 
  it 's westerners ' responsibility to figure out exactly what they want and give it to them , whether that 's allowing unlimited muslim immigration , instituting sharia law in our countries , converting everyone to islam , whatever . 
  until we do that , we can expect well-deserved `` retaliation '' from them . 
  i hope you 're right . 
  it has n't always been the case . 
  i did n't mention killing . 
  your form of retaliation might be effective . 
  you 're giving them way too much credit . 
  actually they want to kill you because you 're not muslim . 
  failing that , they want to terrify you into `` regressive changes to policy '' such as enacting laws to punish negative depictions of muhammed , etc. 
  anger does n't bring about the changes they desire . 
  anger will get them imprisoned/deported and immigration stopped , and possibly their families bombed back home . 
  wrong . 
  terrorists want you to be terrified , not angry . 
  hence `` terrorists '' , not `` angerists '' . 
  terrified people give in to terrorist demands . 
  angry people retaliate . 
  your words , not mine . 
  not all leftists are [ regressive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regressive_left ) . 
  cynically and transparently biased , as one would expect from the independent . 
  always consider the source . 
  i doubt any of these poll questions would yield significantly different results if you asked remain voters . 
  they never thought they could change their culture , nor did they want to . 
  they believed in `` multiculturalism '' , and they believed in `` cultural relativism '' . 
  now that cold , hard reality is starting to conflict with their dogma , some of them ( the ones who are n't hopelessly brainwashed ) are starting to reexamine their beliefs . 
  does n't make the terrorists any less than 100 % responsible for their deeds , not by a single iota . 
  be careful what you wish for . 
  the entire concept of human rights is ultimately based on a christian view of `` unalienable rights endowed by the creator '' . 
  feminist government ? 
  they wo n't do much , if anything , beyond `` deploring it in the strongest possible terms '' . 
  congrats on not being a regressive leftist any more . 
  please teach your friends . 
  well , if it came out of a muslim 's mouth , it 's suspect . 
  a [ core belief of their religion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taqiya ) is that it 's a muslim 's duty to lie and deceive infidels when they feel they are being `` persecuted '' . 
  lol, 
  wow , puppetmaster putin really needs to get his people in line , they are openly defying him . 
  and look how much more advanced google translate is than anything available in the 1990s . 
  in a few decades , automatic translation technology will hopefully progress to the point where this question is moot . 
  the jews did it with hebrew in israel . 
  she 's merely pointing out everything the uk brings to the table .
