  examples of * actual * anti-semitism , not just being labeled as such as a way to discredit him ? 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bj%c3%b6rn_h%c3%b6cke ) is no help . 
  that 's interesting . 
  how/why are they obligated ? 
  online newspapers , mostly . 
   from opinion polls over the years i infer that , while only a third of the electorate seems to want to join the euro , two-thirds are content to remain in the eu and , equally , two-thirds think we shall eventually adopt the euro , but only after a period of augustinian procrastination . 
   both the prime minister and chancellor are pro euro , in the right circumstances , and both are aware of the opinion polls . 
  hmm ? 
  ah , i missed the sarcasm . 
  i thought you had another source . 
   talks haha , good luck with that, 
  to be fair , the british people never voted to join the eu either . 
   brexit was based on hate keep intoning the mantra ... 
  it 's having such a great effect . 
   he 's an antisemite after all . 
  is he ? 
   was never going to have the euro curious what you mean by that . 
  there was plenty of support for joining the euro before the euro crisis . 
  basically the same people who opposed brexit were in favor of joining the euro , although many of them wo n't admit it now . 
   with these antisemitic and highly misanthropic comments , the afd is showing its true face . 
  what were the anti-semitic comments ? 
  the guardian piece did n't quote any . 
  is this just the typical hyperventilating rhetoric of the leftist mainstream media , or did h\u00f6cke actually say something anti-semitic in the speech ? 
  edit : i 'm a bit disappointed that the guardian could n't find a photo that made him look more like hitler . 
  i 'm sure they made every effort . 
  more like a campaign to boost sales of rom . 
  brilliant advertising campaign for them , although the effect on `` national ego '' is highly questionable . 
  that 's fucking disturbing . 
  akin to seeing a burn victim mummified in bandages . 
  i 'm glad we do n't have the same degree of muslim problem in the u.s. 
  i do n't envy euros ' having to make such tough decisions . 
  in the u.s. we probably would n't be able to ban them , because they are constitutionally protected ( under freedom of religion and/or expression clauses ) . 
  that would perpetuate their isolation and lack of assimilation , but we would n't be able to do anything about it . 
  luckily , our muslims tend to integrate more ( so far ) , and we 're hesitating to let in a million of them from syria . 
  most of your reddit activity is in r/shitamericanssay . 
  you play eve online . 
  you are a clown . 
  goodbye . 
  the national guard is not regular military . 
  hth . 
  more like it 's just not worth the effort , since you and i both know exactly the type of person you are . 
  there 's nothing i could say that would change your mind or propaganda goals , so why bother ? 
  so yeah , either you 're dumb , or dishonest , or both . 
  either you 're kind of dumb , or you 're kind of dishonest . 
  edit : or both . 
  can you be more specific ? 
  they 're mostly `` weekend warriors '' who have full-time civilian jobs . 
  they are n't viewed as serious , hardcore military . 
  people make a significant distinction in their minds . 
  it implies that military force might be used against the domestic civilian population . 
  bombs are for foreigners , not for americans . 
   using military within germany is only allowed in cases of natural disasters to lend manpower and equipment for the aid effort . 
  in the u.s. , we do n't use regular military even in those cases . 
  our regular military are reserved for the rest of the world . 
  because you 're special . 
  i think you can buy frozen [ pierogies ] ( https://www.heb.com/search/?q=pierogi ) in nearly every grocery store around the country , nowadays . 
  they 're just another kind of [ eggroll ] ( https://www.heb.com/search/?q=eggroll ) or [ ravioli ] ( https://www.heb.com/search/?q=ravioli ) , as far as we 're concerned . 
  check again , haha . 
  english did n't get to 3 million words by inventing its own words . 
  man , you people are like a hamster running in a wheel -- you never stop . 
  nor do you ever achieve anything . 
   with smaller hands well , at least trump 's hands are bigger than obama 's , so that national shame is finally behind us . 
   actually as i understood it , the american was what started the disappeared of all double letters and a lot of the english oddities , exceptions and the like . 
  when the american [ noah webster published his dictionary in 1806 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noah_webster#dictionary ) , english spellings were not yet standardized . 
  he did not invent new spellings ; he `` chose already existing options such as * center * , * color * and * check * [ vs. * centre * , * colour * , and * cheque * ] on such grounds as simplicity , analogy or etymology '' . 
  british dictionary publishers made different decisions . 
  but the number of words that americans and british people spell differently is [ minuscule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_and_british_english_spelling_differences ) . 
  and this is not an ongoing divergence ; the process was finished in the 19th century . 
  ( in contrast , official [ french spelling reforms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reforms_of_french_orthography ) are still being instituted even today . ), 
   but i was n't talking about the oxford english , the american or whichever of the gazillions of english slangs that exists , i was talking about the `` internet english '' , what i called the * muricanglish * which is what most people use here and around the world . 
  i think you are exaggerating the popularity of that term . 
  i 've never heard it before . 
  i doubt it will ever be popular among americans , since it is clearly derogatory towards americans . 
   it 's a mix of american colloquial english , with its accent from the movies / tv-shows , with the oxford english grammar that was taught in schools because it is still the reference , and the internet slang with all its acronyms , shortcuts and text message jargon . 
  unlike the french language , for english there is no official body ( either in britain or anywhere else ) which dictates what is `` correct '' usage , spelling , etc. 
  dictionary authors are careful to point out that they merely `` describe '' how words are used ; they do not `` prescribe '' how words should be used . 
  many people find this annoying , but it is nonetheless true . 
  oxford university has its own * manual of style * describing various grammar/punctuation/usage rules , but it is only one of many authoritative sources on the subject , and not considered `` official '' or superior all the others . 
  to illustrate this , take the example of the [ oxford comma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serial_comma#recommendations_by_style_guides ) : in formal writing , americans follow oxford 's rule more often than british people do . 
  colloquialisms arise everywhere english is spoken . 
  americans have a large influence due to sheer numbers , but plenty of slang words and other `` degeneracy '' has originated on the other side of the pond as well . 
  this process is very much ongoing , as it has been for millennia . 
  that 's how the language evolves over time . 
  i guess i fundamentally reject your implication that the `` dumbing down of english '' is somehow american in character . 
  the conservative and the dynamic forces are * both * stronger in the u.s. because of its greater population and cultural influence . 
  and in recent history , english was dominant . 
  why is history relevant ? 
  i do n't understand the contradiction . 
  which of the opinions do you find to be incompatible with the others ? 
   napoleon was short that 's a [ myth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_depictions_of_napoleon#napoleon.27s_height ) , but it still works as an insult , because everyone believes the myth . 
   some call it english and others american , but what is actually used worldwide or on the internet is muricanglish , an english dumbed down big time . 
  and it 's actually taking over proper oxford english . 
  this is a highly ignorant generalization . 
  ask any british person whether he thinks american english is `` dumbed down '' . 
  the difference between american and british conventions are utterly minuscule in comparison to the commonalities , and neither is `` better '' or `` dumber '' than the other . 
  both `` flavors '' have developed over multiple centuries by highly educated native speakers . 
  in many cases , the british convention represents a simplification , whereas the american equivalent is the more conservative practice . 
  ( and vice versa . ), 
  if you 're talking about slang , that 's a different matter . 
  but slang is not a threat to formal english , as long as people judge the intelligence and education of others by their speech .
