   this is not just something that ** affects ** a foreign speaker , the simplification of the language ** affects ** everyone . 
  it actually does have limited verb conjugation , although i guess you can be understood without it . 
   all the while finnish military still prepares for the big war that might or hopefully might not happen being prepared for it makes it less likely that such a war will happen . 
  honesty . 
  i 'm aware of all of that . 
  ignorance is not my problem . 
  i am merely opposed to lies and willful distortions in pursuit of a political agenda . 
  the fact is , we as a society can not depend fully on wind energy . 
  because of its intermittent nature , and since storing that energy in batteries is prohibitively expensive , the viability of wind energy * depends * on the availability of other forms of energy when there is no wind . 
  achieving `` 100 percent reliance on wind energy '' is by its nature impossible , and thus * not a worthy goal * , and hence not something that should be promoted as an ideal . 
  certainly not something that we should * pretend * we have achieved by trading `` certificates '' . 
  objectivity is impossible . 
  moral judgements are entailed , and those are based on opinions most would regard as political . 
  when the author tries to pretend that the rankings are objective , amoral and apolitical , it ought to annoy the shit out of you . 
   including the signing of a `` no-spy agreement '' as mentioned elsewhere in the article , the members spy on each other . 
  france was offered membership on the existing terms , but wanted to change the terms . 
  but apparently [ there is no such rule ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) . 
  but the whole premise is nonsensical . 
  any such ranking entails choices about the factors and their weightings , based on a moral judgement of their contribution to the `` greater good of humanity '' . 
  the choice to normalize by population size is itself arbitrary . 
  if two countries affect `` the greater good '' by the same amount , but have different population sizes , why is one more `` good '' than the other ? 
  would n't it make just as much sense to normalize by any number of other factors , such as gdp , availability of natural resources , etc. ? 
  they are trying to maintain a patina of objectivity , but at the root this is nothing more than a political exercise . 
  based on the title , i guess dutch train service is only offered on windy days . 
  the author is neglecting , evading , or concealing the fact that wind and solar power are highly intermittent energy sources . 
  well , as long as we 're promoting the right agenda , the truth is n't important . 
  if this thread is deleted by the mods ( which is a possibility , although it does n't violate any rules ) , then you should repost it in r/askeurope . 
  from the article :  according to the news magazine l'obs , in 2009 , the united states proposed to france to join the five eyes , that would then have become the `` six eyes '' . 
  nicolas sarkozy however made the requirement to be granted the same status as other allies , including the signing of a `` no-spy agreement '' . 
  this requirement was approved by the director of the nsa , but not by the director of the cia , and furthermore not by president barack obama , resulting in a refusal from france . 
   we are not making any moral judgments about countries . 
  ...  a country that contributes to the ** greater good of humanity ** . 
  in the u.s. we prefer our charity to be voluntary , so we do it through private non-profits , rather than just transferring huge quantities of taxpayers ' money involuntarily to africa . 
  if you count private charity in your calculation , the u.s. is quite generous . 
   the five eyes agreement . 
  something which france is notably left out of . 
  france was invited in , but refused to join . 
  source : the article you linked, 
   her campaign to `` reconquer the public space '' for pedestrians and cyclists . 
  `` reconquer '' ? 
  when was paris ever `` conquered '' by pedestrians and cyclists ? 
  bicycles were invented in the 1800s , and by that time horses and carriages had been ubiquitous for millenia . 
  if you really want to harken back to some romantic `` human-powered era '' you probably need to go back to the stone age or earlier . 
  that can be her campaign slogan : `` bring back the stone age ! '', 
  sure . 
  you pay extra , but that 's capitalism for ya . 
  it certainly is . 
  have you ever tried ? 
  give me a break . 
  that is a hilarious ( if annoying ) joke , not some sinister political statement . 
  there are two tunnels . 
  the joke is that the two are being conflated . 
  * tunnel 1 : the `` tunnel '' of the long , terrible year 2016 . 
  * tunnel 2 : the `` tunnel '' of the barrel of a gun being aimed at the french people . 
  the message : do n't get so excited about the end of 2016 . 
  we are still being held at gunpoint by terrorists . 
  secondary message : people who do n't understand this are naive ( hence the goofy , credulous depiction of the frenchman ) . 
   tl ; dr it will be more expensive for you you 're neglecting the additional taxes you have to pay for bank bailouts . 
   in its current alliteration that is a strange error . 
  what word did you intend ? 
  perhaps `` iteration '' ? 
  ( i agree with your message overall . 
  i 'm just curious about the error because i am a word geek . ), 
  any sentence that begins with the word `` let 's '' is not a promise . 
  it is merely advocating a course of action . 
  it is you who are being disingenuous in pretending otherwise . 
  keyword : `` let 's '' . 
  a proposal is not a promise . 
  to conflate the two is idiocy or dishonesty , take your pick . 
  the guardian is so gullible . 
  they 'll believe anything that supports their religious dogma that we can do without fossil fuels in the near future . 
  none of these companies are pledging to `` be powered 100 % by renewable energy '' . 
  solar and wind power are not reliable enough . 
  from the `` three-phase strategy '' cited by hp :  acquire or generate off-site renewable power to offset brown power emissions , including the use of renewable energy credits ( recs ) and power purchase agreements ( ppas ) . 
  in other words , if they can `` offset '' their emissions from traditional ( reliable ) power sources by getting other people to use solar/wind , they will consider themselves `` 100 % powered by renewable energy '' for the purposes of pr campaigns . 
  meanwhile their business models are still utterly dependent upon the uninterrupted , reliable power from traditional sources . 
  well , at least you still get the benefit of american pharmaceutical research without paying an equal share for it . 
  yay , finally something the euros paid for that we americans can sponge off of . 
  usually it 's the other way around . 
  tldr from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_nicholas#veneration_and_celebrations ) :  nicholas had a reputation for secret gift-giving , such as putting coins in the shoes of those who left them out for him , a practice celebrated on his feast day , 6 december . 
   in medieval times nuns used the night of 6 december to deposit baskets of food and clothes anonymously at the doorsteps of the needy . 
   on 6 december every sailor or ex-sailor of the low countries ( which at that time was virtually all of the male population ) would descend to the harbour towns to participate in a church celebration for their patron saint . 
  on the way back they would stop at one of the various nicholas fairs to buy some hard-to-come-by goods , gifts for their loved ones and invariably some little presents for their children . 
  while the real gifts would only be presented at christmas , the little presents for the children were given right away , courtesy of saint nicholas .

  * dutchization, 
  the interesting thing to me is that even though the details vary , everyone agrees on the practice of lying to their kids and pretending that someone else is bringing their gifts . 
  how did this start ? 
  based on the article , it seems like he would 've served only about another six weeks . 
  he plea-bargained down to a lesser offense and only got 90 days total . 
  wow , you have got this totally warped . 
  the offer you quoted was made by the romanian government . 
  they offered to have a trial in romania , with the sentence to be carried out in the u.s. how can you use this to call americans `` disgusting '' ? 
  where is your source showing that van goethem was drunk ? 
   it also said he would probably not get a fair trial in the u.s. if he were extradited . 
  that seems irrelevant , since the trial was already finished back in 1977 , and you can not be tried twice for the same crime in the u.s. ( `` double jeopardy '' ) . 
  maybe they 're referring to a trial for the crime of failing to appear before the court , when he fled the country . 
  in that case i 'm curious why a polish court thinks he could n't have got a fair trial for it in the u.s. just fashionable anti-americanism ? 
  we got next, 
  life is meaningless regardless of human rights .
