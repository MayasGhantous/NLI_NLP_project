  okay , you convinced me . 
  it may be that a certain amount of prosperity is necessary to create a demand for democracy . 
  something similar to [ maslow 's hierarchy of needs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs ) , on a national scale . 
  that still leaves open the question of whether democracy is necessary to * maximize * prosperity .

  depends on how cynical you are . 
  a less cynical person would call it a delusion , a fudge , or an ideal . 
  democracy is essential ( i.e. 
  necessary ) but not sufficient for protecting human rights . 
  i agree that human rights are best protected in a democratic country with a constitution and independent judicial review . 
  in dictatorships , though , the constitution is a sham and there is no true separation of powers . 
  maybe if there were a dictator who respected the constitution and deferred to a judiciary , human rights would be protected , but i very much doubt that 's possible . 
  there are many possible definitions . 
  examples : * a plurality of the population , when there is no majority in favor of any alternative * a supermajority , such as 66 % or 75 % of the population , for important decisions * a majority , subject to human rights protections set out in a bill of rights which ca n't be violated even if the majority supports it etc. 
  `` the will of the people '' can be a pretty nebulous term . 
  there is no single , universal definition for it , but obviously some definitions are more legitimate than others . 
  democracy is rule by the people . 
  many systems that have safeguards against the `` tyranny of the majority '' still qualify as democratic , as long as they have self government in a form that upholds the will of the people . 
  you can certainly quibble about whether any system is `` pure democracy '' , but in this survey it 's obvious that a more general definition was intended . 
  essential to what ? 
  essential to human life ? 
  obviously not . 
  essential to happiness ? 
  probably not , depending on the person . 
  essential to reaching one 's true potential ? 
  maybe . 
  essential to maximizing the prosperity of a country ? 
  probably . 
  essential to protecting human rights ? 
  yes . 
  i think the question is brain-dead , and the declining results are due to increasing sophistication of the responders . 
  i do n't get how he can be both pro-euro and anti-federalist . 
  is n't it pretty well accepted by now that the euro ca n't succeed in the long term without fiscal union ? 
  that 's a great infographic , thanks . 
  in short , it was a coward 's speech . 
  well , i 'll take your comment at face value -- as a genuine question and not a preemptive dismissal . 
  a lot of people respect putin because he acts in the interests of his country , and not the global elite . 
  you do n't have to be a racist/xenophobe to believe that it is the moral obligation of an elected leader to uphold the interests of his constituents * above * those of foreigners . 
  to some extent it is a reaction against the globalist leadership of the west . 
  commence downvoting . 
  all i did was answer the question , but i guess most people would rather have their heads in the sand and continue to believe there is no rational thought on the opposing side of the debate . 
  ha ha . 
  thanks for the laughs . 
  i think he would 've stopped , when push came to shove . 
  shitstorm avoidance is a powerful motivator , especially when you 're at the end of your tour and getting ready for shore leave . 
  lots of things that are n't weapons can kill you if used improperly . 
  man , who would 've thought that the country that invented bullfighting would be such huge pussies ? 
  i still think the sub captain was bluffing . 
  no way he 'd want to put up with the resulting shitstorm . 
  not exactly the most reliable source , but fairly believable i guess . 
  i 'm pretty sure the sub captain was bluffing , though . 
  it is not a weapon . 
  lots of things burn at 1600 \u00b0 c that are n't weapons . 
  signal flares are signaling devices , not weapons . 
   februari this year a us nuclear submarine issued a final warning it would ram the spanish coast guard if the british did n't remove them . 
  seriously ? 
  a submarine threatened to ram a ship ? 
  that 's very hard to believe . 
  so does a [ sparkler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sparkler ) , but we let toddlers handle them . 
  ha ha , maybe by spanish standards signal flares are `` incendiary weapons '' . 
  perhaps it 's time to raise defense spending above 0.91 % of gdp . 
  looks like italy needs a good pressure-washing . 
  they are drastically overstating the case . 
  there is no `` era '' , more of an `` event '' in which a massive fuck-you is delivered to the establishment , telling them that unlimited immigration/globalisation is n't acceptable . 
  the `` era '' will only continue so long as further fuck-yous continue to be needed to get the message across . 
  lol , i guess mr. hollande is n't familiar with the constitution of the u.s. 
  what 's the difference ? 
  i know they are untranslatable , but at least try . 
  [ pine ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pine?s=t ) ( verb ) :  1 \\ . 
  to yearn deeply ; suffer with longing ; long painfully ( often followed by * for * ) :  * to pine for one 's home and family *  2 \\ . 
  to fail gradually in health or vitality from grief , regret , or longing ( often followed by * away * ) :  * separated by their families , the lovers pined away . 
  the [ wuppertal suspension railway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wuppertal_suspension_railway ) actually opened in 1901 . 
  crazy germans . 
  wow . 
  so your opinions are `` facts '' and mine are `` alternative-truths '' . 
  silence the heretic !, 
  * laugh/cry/facepalm * edit : lol , and now i 've been banned from r/europe . 
  welp , enjoy your fascist echo chamber . 
  i was responding to a hypothesis with an alternate hypothesis . 
  the argument comes afterward . 
   mods , my comments here being `` controversial '' going into negative should really make you question the state of this subreddit and who you allowed to find a home here . 
  why is it always people with political opinions like yours , who are eager to silence people you disagree with ? 
  there does n't seem to be an obvious causal relationship , but there is an undeniable correlation . 
  edit : hey mods , you forgot to delete this post in the process of erasing all trace of my `` hate speech '' from the sub . 
  get to it !, 
  juncker has zero credibility on the topic . 
  not only is he vindictive and emotionally-driven , but he 's also clueless . 
  the less input he has into the brexit negotiations , the better for everyone . 
  the adults need to sit down and work out a mutually beneficial agreement . 
  juncker is not one of the adults . 
  compare those to u.s. states . 
  awesome . 
  i love giant planes . 
  so , who originally did the homework ? 
  just curious . 
  the eu does n't have a very good track record of holding member states to the rules . 
   the agencies are going to move anyway regardless of when it happens , so it should n't matter to the uk . 
  and the uk is going to negotiate trade deals with other countries anyway regardless of when it happens , so it should n't matter to the eu . 
  i 'm sure that will be the legalistic position of eu negotiators , but it does n't have much persuasive power at the negotiating table . 
  on the other hand , if the eu is going to sever such ties immediately , it ca n't credibly object if the uk starts negotiating outside trade deals immediately .
