  peace is not the absence of war . 
  peace is the absence of tyranny . 
  do you think that makes a point , or are you just being anal ? 
  it 's justifiable because expressing repugnant opinions should be protected free speech . 
  the identity of the doll is irrelevant . 
  alliances can also prevent wars . 
  do you really think if not for the u.s. alliance south korea would not have been invaded by north korea long ago ? 
  an invasion would n't fail , it just would have unacceptable costs . 
  most likely seoul would suffer extensive bombardment , even if nk was unable to deploy its nuclear weapons . 
  but taking out the nk government would not be difficult . 
  i 'm totally in favor of this . 
  it 's about time the globalist bankers got a taste of their own medicine . 
  wow , you are disgusting . 
  depends on whether you 're forced to cover it on penalty of death . 
  context ? 
   suddely , pepe is the meme version of evil incarnate , and somehow a racist , right-wing symbol . 
  the precise sequence of events for this was the following : 1 . 
  trump supporters used lots of pepe memes . 
  the american mainstream media and other pro-hillary organizations noticed this . 
  they demonized pepe as a way to demonize trump supporters and hence trump himself . 
  hth . 
  so beautiful . 
  i shed a tear . 
  umm . . what are you implying , that there is some great nazi movement in the u.s. ? 
  i 'd say ( 1 ) step away from the ledge , and ( 2 ) maybe diversify your news sources a bit . 
  what if you want to wash your face ? 
  your point ? 
  `` trigger happy '' i saw it in an episode of the * bible black * anime movie . 
  there are two women ^ 1 bent over the sink in a public restroom . 
  a man ^ 2 is raping one , and he has a shotgun anally penetrating the other . 
  when he reaches orgasm , he pulls the trigger . 
  ^ 1 the taxpayers ^ 2 the government, 
  that 's true . 
  seems like they could meet that requirement by either ( 1 ) making all decompression scenarios `` extremely improbable '' , or ( 2 ) designing an automatic system that noses down the plane in the event of cabin depressurization . 
  if the cabin pressure is ok , you 'd still want the plane to have a good glide ratio . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deadstick_landing ) , a boeing 747 has a glide ratio of 15:1 , which makes it a significantly * better * glider than a tiny cessna 172 . 
  um , no , i did n't know that . 
  and it does n't sound very likely , tbh . 
  got a link ? 
  i would hope that it would require far * more * than a simple majority . 
  for such a drastic change , if 49.9 % of people are against it , they should be able to block it . 
  that sounds fun/terrifying . 
  powered flight must be very boring for you . 
  if you 're up in a regular plane and the engine cuts out , you yawn and say `` oh well , we 're a glider now '' . 
  the sanctions are quite explicitly about ukraine , in addition to alleged interference in american elections . 
  not sure how you got the idea that they 're `` not about ukraine '' . 
  boston accents are pretty funny . 
  when they travel , they get mocked relentlessly every time they open their mouths . 
  charm is the opposite of prestige . 
  haha :d, 
  * triathlon, 
  my dad was in the u.s. navy , and according to him , that was a marine corps shower . 
  who is mujo , and why schnapps ? 
  i like the ones that are difficult to translate , those are the interesting ones . 
  i do n't know . 
  if a german said it , i 'd probably take it at face value and apologize . 
  he really could 've had a grandfather who was a prison guard at auschwitz , and that really would be a sore subject . 
  of course , that would make it all the more hilarious when he told me he was joking . 
  tongue ? 
  why do british people often leave off the period ( full stop ) at the end of the last sentence in a paragraph ? 
  ( see the above two comments . ), 
  i even often see it in british newspapers . 
  that sounds awesome . 
  why do n't you live like that any more ? 
  this obviously wo n't work in all languages , but some of you may be able to adapt it for your nefarious purposes :  what 's the best thing about fucking twenty-three-year-olds ? 
   there 's twenty of them . 
  tomato / tomato, 
  how have i lived this long without knowing that `` to cunt '' is a verb ? 
  well if we had n't saved your ass in two world wars , you 'd be speaking german rather than american right now . 
  * ducks *, 
  are you sure it was butter , not cream cheese ? 
   dodging taxes through borderline illegal means is heavily frowned upon , whereas that 's somewhat celebrated in the usa . 
   there 's nothing impressive about a toilet built out of solid gold , and that 's seen as majorly tacky here , which again i do n't really think is the case within the usa . 
  you 're a moron .

  nothing wrong with her that could n't be fixed with a paper bag .

  i have no idea what the origin can be . 
  i did n't translate it wrong . 
  it 's truly like that . 
  i wonder if it 's related to the [ english folk song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cicmq2s_dm ) . 
  what does this mean ? 
   `` storm in a teacup '' ; petty/pointless argument about something inconsequential we usually say `` tempest in a teacup '' . 
  have n't heard `` storm in a teacup '' . 
  the latter seems inferior due to its lack of alliteration . 
  global warming , am i right ? 
  we 'll be wearing mexican sombreros here before long . 
  the idea that socialism is immoral and ineffective . 
  the simple ( spineless ) fudge is to identify `` eu english '' as a `` recognized form of english '' and be done with it . 
  this document is ironic , given that our own spineless dictionary authors would wholeheartedly reject the concept of `` correct '' usage . 
  edit : it is interesting , though . 
  as an educated native english speaker , i find many of the recommendations good , but many are petty and/or arbitrary , and in some cases i outright disagree with them . 
  the document seems like the kind of overbearing stuff that often is produced by government bodies in general , and the eu in particular . 
  well , she 's not wrong . 
  in a vehicle collision , the one with the greater mass usually wins .
