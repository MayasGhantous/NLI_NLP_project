  `` thenceforth '' is not quite archaic , but very rare and stilted . 
  `` whenceforth '' i 've never actually seen anyone use , but i deduced that it must exist , and it [ does ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/whenceforth ) . 
   a hundred years ago , it was decided that henceforth preference would be given to k instead of c , kudos for using `` henceforth '' , but you missed a rare chance to use the word `` thenceforth '' . 
  if you can properly use `` whenceforth '' in a sentence , that is truly impressive . 
  what a great analogy for the welfare state and its effects on humanity . 
  u/stumpy3196 does n't speak for 300 million people . 
  i 'd say the most common attitudes in the u.s. toward the british monarchy are curiosity , bemusement , apathy , and total ignorance . 
  with a few soap opera fans mixed in who enjoy that aspect of it . 
  i personally do n't know anyone who * hates * the british monarchy . 
  anyone who expressed such an opinion would probably be thought of as annoyingly ideological . 
  strictly speaking , you are of course correct . 
  however , the british system is based on a bunch of people acting civilized toward one another , and deferring/obeying even if they are n't strictly required by the constitution to do so , but only by precedent . 
  it 's under that framework that the parliament defers to supreme court rulings , even though parliament is theoretically sovereign . 
  by the same token , many powers are exercised by `` the crown '' , which ultimately operates under royal assent , even though , again , parliament is sovereign . 
  there is real power there , that is exercised every day . 
  it 's kind of analogous to a marriage . 
  theoretically you could overpower your wife and bend her to your will . 
  but to deny that she has power in the relationship , and exercises it , would be naive . 
  u/stumpy3196 does n't speak for me . 
  i do n't `` hate monarchy '' . 
  i have some understanding of britain 's unique , organically-developed system , and i believe it has advantages and disadvantages vs. the u.s. system . 
  i just think in this day and age , people find a harmless , familiar old woman a lot more palatable as a privileged figurehead than they would her potential male successors . 
  if/when she steps down ( or dies ) , i think the clock starts , and the next male monarch will be the last one . 
  the queen has real power , which she actually does exercise behind the scenes , contrary to popular belief . 
  the next king will have that power removed , imo , and probably the title as well . 
  just my opionion . 
  ymmv . 
  ( jerusalem is probably a no-go , however . 
  too christian . 
  but it is a beautiful , evocative hymn . ), 
  to be fair , we normally ignore all but the first verse . 
   unfortunately , the us has a rather difficult to sing anthem that also had to be censored because it has some rather racist remarks in it curious what you 're referring to . 
  afaik it 's never been censored . 
  you guys should switch to rule britannia . 
  keep gstq for england , or maybe `` jerusalem '' when they abolish the monarchy . 
  the state slogan of minnesota is `` land of 10,000 lakes '' . 
  so at least there is a lot of lakeshore , if not seashore . 
  as in 1848 ? 
  we call them forty-niners . 
  i guess it took them a while to get to california . 
  dude do you really need to troll this thread so hard ? 
  i 'm trying to get untainted opinions here , and you 're turning it into a nationalistic pissing contest that 's going to prevent people from responding honestly . 
   in what metric ? 
  in not using the metric system . 
  so given that , do you think the netherlands has suffered for their absence ? 
  if she sticks with it for a few more years and is good enough , she might be able to earn a scholarship to play soccer at a u.s. college . 
  `` good game , fuckface '' ? 
  that 's uneducated people in general , not just british ones . 
  i love bread . 
  i would die very fat and happy in germany . 
   different connotations . 
  interesting . 
  what do you mean ? 
  do the characters speak german with an english accent ? 
  if so , then it 's not different from any number of english-language movies with foreign characters . 
  edit : the original doc martin is n't very funny , either . 
  it 's more `` folksy '' . 
  also occasionally a [ diaeresis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diaeresis_%28diacritic%29%23diaeresis ) is used in words like co\u00f6perate , re\u00ebducate , etc. 
  by stuffy old people . 
  i do n't understsand why \u00df has the function of `` ss '' , when it originated as a ligature of `` sz '' ( or '' \u0283z '' as it was often written in olden times ) . 
  i knew it already i guess , but hanging around r/europe has reinforced the lesson that just because someone ca n't speak your language fluently does n't mean they are n't smart or even brilliant . 
  it 's always a pleasure when that shines through the language barrier . 
  also , there 's a place called france where the naked ladies dance . 
  '' [ dutch oven ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_oven ) '' also ( and originally ) refers to a large cast-iron pot with a lid . 
  it 's good for baking over an open fire . 
  the plot was ridiculous in the u.s. , too . 
  it was contrived to make a political statement . 
  do n't believe everything you see on tv . 
  you can * live * without the `` best available healthcare '' . 
  many advanced treatments cost millions of dollars but only give you a few extra percent chance of survival . 
  it 's realistically available to the vast majority of people . 
  and everyone has access to something that 's better than nothing . 
  you ca n't own a ferrari if you do n't have a lot of money , but you can ride the bus . 
  and the majority of people can own a nice car if they prioritize it . 
  [ there is no such thing as `` excessive profit '' ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-17/free-market-no-profit-excessive ) . 
   you have to proof that the risk/gain-quota in your special case is better than average i.e. 
  `` death panels '' . 
  this is one common form of rationing in socialized systems . 
  another is waiting lists . 
  the third is bribes/patronage . 
  all of these are wasteful and destructive and produce worse outcomes than using price as the rationing mechanism . 
  sure , socialized medicine can `` work '' , if there is * also * a giant free market system elsewhere in the world that can act as your `` fallback '' if you need immediate , advanced care . 
  and as long as that external free-market system will fund advanced drug research , that your government can then effectively steal by refusing to honor the patents . 
  but do n't advocate for socialized medicine worldwide when it * depends * on a free-market system existing somewhere . 
  be grateful you are able to sponge off the u.s. consumer to subsidize your healthcare . 
  do n't try to ruin a good thing . 
  you ca n't seriously think ad hominem attacks are in any way persuasive ? 
  it does n't matter who said it . 
  i just gave attribution for the purpose of giving credit , not as some kind of appeal to authority . 
   how do you know what `` they '' consider to be morally reprehensible ? 
  i listen to their rhetoric . 
  these are the same people who think having too many rich people is a bad thing because of the resulting `` income inequality '' . 
  such people would not be satisfied with a two-tier system and its attendant `` healthcare inequality '' . 
   resources should be shared so we all can prosper . 
  prosperity can not exist without property rights . 
  socialism actively destroys human productivity . 
  the profit motive drives innovation and progress . 
  each and every case in which socialism has been tried throughout history , it has been a failure because it is contrary to human nature . 
  the only cases where socialism `` works '' is where it 's being temporarily propped up by a free-market system . 
  but eventually , it always collapses .
