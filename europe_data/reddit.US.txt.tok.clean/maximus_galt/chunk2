  why should uk 's intelligence contributions not be afforded any value in the negotiations ? 
  is the `` p '' even audible , if you do n't put a short vowel between it and the following consonant ? 
  i would imagine that the educated english speakers who imported the words did pronounce the `` p '' , but people listening ( who may have been illiterate ) may not have heard it . 
  the insectoid letters . 
  that 's odd , since we have both of those sounds in english words like `` exit '' and `` ellipse '' , respectively . 
  ( both of which originate ultimately from greek , via latin . ), 
   what does lithuania contribute ? 
  better question , if there 's no lithuania in nato , what would other nato members lose ? 
  another chunk of land with people who do n't have to be afraid of russia and thus will flourish and provide trade and other opportunities for the other nato members . 
  also a buffer zone for the neighboring countries . 
  [ markets ` shrug off ' article 50 letter ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39429069 ) comments ? 
   i literally explained this above . 
  yes , i know that this is an abstract subject for people who are a bit fresh to economics , but that does n't make it any less true . 
  i suggest you read this : http://www.sharemarketschool.com/how-does-news-affect-stock-prices/ . 
  what you are referring to is called `` factoring in the news '' , and is a part of fundamental analysis . 
  people are n't logical , people are emotional , and that always leads to a nash equilibrium where deadlines lead to shockwaves . 
  if you do n't believe me , you can see this phenomenon happen in the next few weeks . 
  do you wish to amend your advice to `` people who are a bit fresh to economics '' ? 
   the biggest issue is that , from an economic standpoint , the best possible joint outcome is the status quo . 
  the best possible outcome is that the uk improves its trade with the rest of the world , the eu integrates in ways that were previously obstructed by the uk , and trade between the eu and uk continues mostly unchanged under a mutually beneficial trade agreement . 
  that 's a lot better than the status quo , for all parties . 
  if it makes you feel any better , u/bloodysneeze 's opinions are extreme . 
  they represent a tiny minority of opinion in the u.s. 
  most americans view our solidarity with democratic nations to be a solemn duty , and ultimately in the interests of ourselves and the world . 
  so what if carrero blanco was a `` fascist '' ? 
  you can call anyone a fascist . 
  does that make it ok for you to violate their rights ? 
  too many people still have n't figured out that freedom of speech has to be protected for everyone , not just the people you like . 
  the whole point of free speech is to protect speech that somebody does n't like . 
  if it 's bland and inoffensive to everyone , then free speech protections are irrelevant ; no one will be punished for it . 
  next time it could be you who is targeted , so you need to stand up for everyone . 
  today 's the day . 
   they do mean the same thing good luck with that little crusade . 
  i will grant you that babbage was an intellectual titan , and arguably made the greatest contributions to the historical development of the modern computer . 
  at this point i 'm not even sure you know the difference between the internet and the web . 
  the internet did n't `` precede '' the web , it underlies it . 
  there are many activities on the internet besides the www . 
  http traffic is just a tiny percentage of overall bandwidth usage . 
  yes , some people do use the two terms interchangeably . 
  that 's been my point all along . 
  they * do n't * mean the same thing . 
  that 's a good article , which explains what i 've been repeating over and over again : it depends on your definition of what a computer is . 
  computers have developed over a long period of time with many incremental improvements by different people . 
  to say any one person `` invented '' them is an oversimplification . 
  welp , then babbage 's device was n't a computer , because it was n't electronic . 
  i 'm not sure what your point is . 
  i was talking about people conflating the internet and the www , and you seem to be saying the same thing , but for some reason you think you 're contradicting me in some way . 
  like i said , it depends on how you define `` computer '' . 
  if it 's just a mechanical device for adding numbers , well the sumerians were using the abacus several millennia ago . 
  if you 've never heard anyone make that claim , then consider yourself lucky . 
  even reputable news sources get it wrong all the time . 
  https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/12/tim_berners_lee_inventor_of_the_internet_headline_fails/ even the venerable bbc gets it wrong sometimes : [ `` the internet 's inventor tim berners-lee '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04jc12j ) ; [ `` oxford graduate tim berners-lee is credited with inventing the internet '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/bus/ontour/oxford.shtml ) ; [ `` tim berners-lee 's internet '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/20ztbrybbd4ptm8lgwzlcwz/gary-boyd-hope-introduces-the-steam-railways-collection ) ; [ `` sir tim bernes-lee to type on his internet to entertain us '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/worldservice/writerinresidence/2012/07 ) not to mention the common practice of calling tim berners-lee `` the inventor of the web '' in places where `` web '' clearly is intended to mean `` internet '' . 
  i 've already explained why it 's an oversimplification to say that any one individual ( or nationality , for that matter ) `` invented the computer '' . 
  i do n't know how to convince you of this , so we 're going to have to agree to disagree . 
  * facepalm *, 
  have you tried googling `` first computer '' ? 
   well charles babbage is considered to be the father of the computer . 
  by some . 
  blaise pascal , who predated him , also shares some claim to the title . 
   and tim berners-lee did not invent the internet but he did invent the world wide web . 
  yep . 
   i back up the american 's with the `` internet '' side of things and that tbi just invented what we know was the internet today . 
  we use lots of internet applications that are n't part of the world wide web . 
  examples : e-mail , audio/videoconferencing , bittorrent , multiplayer online games , mobile apps , etc. 
   the colossus secrets where sold to the american 's after the war and companies made what would be the pc from that information . 
   so yes , britain built the first pc . 
  he is the father of pc 's and the digital age , how can you even argue that ?? 
  even google acknowledges this . 
  ( the company not the search engine ) sorry , bro . 
  that vacuum tube-based monstrosity was several generations removed from the first `` personal computer '' . 
  look , i 'm not denying that british people were among the main contributors to the development of computers , including many pivotal innovations . 
  but computers have developed incrementally . 
  what qualifies as the `` world 's first computer '' depends on your criteria . 
  yep , it was a very pioneering project . 
  but it has no more claim to be the `` first computer '' than several other projects around the world . 
  just as tim berners-lee `` invented '' the www ( a mere synthesis of existing technologies ) when the internet had existed already for decades , and the uk has been over-hyping it ever since . 
   computers , which is a british invention , lulz . 
  you guys are so cute . 
  tim berners-lee `` invented the internet '' , too . 
  [ yeah , weak allies . 
  who said i was offended ? 
  stop putting words in people 's mouths . 
  annoyed , yes . 
   all the fucks i do n't give . 
  the feeling is mutual . 
  there were like 4 articles on the front page of r/europe with headlines about juncker saying stupid things . 
  jesus , does n't this guy ever shut up ? 
  the most dramatic sky possible , detracting attention from the most boring landscape possible . 
  well played , dunstable downs . 
  hmm ... 
  i wonder ... * ( photoshops feverishly ) * [ yep , it works for kansas , too !, 
  juncker is failure incarnate . 
  actually , no . 
  the problem is that you people think the president has authority that he does n't . 
  the president signing a deal does n't commit the country to it , unless he goes through the constitutionally-required process of getting senate approval . 
  it 's not our fault you 're willing to accept the word of a politician who will have no power in a few years , who does n't have the authority to bind the country to foreign treaties . 
  my comment was n't meant as an attack on denmark . 
  just a rejection of the attempt to make this into a condemnation of `` us debt style economics '' . 
  given germany 's pathological fear of nuclear power , it would be unwise to subject the project to a veto from them . 
  by the danish standard , the u.s. has been `` debt-free '' for a very long time .
