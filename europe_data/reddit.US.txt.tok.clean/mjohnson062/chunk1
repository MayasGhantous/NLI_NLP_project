i think it varies . 
  we 've considered , and may still , move to europe . 
  whichever nation we would move to ( not that i 'd particularly have a choice ) i 'd accept giving up my firearms . 
  * not * in the us i would n't though . 
  there are degrees of trust . 
  i 'd trust russia less , but i 'm not thinking about moving there though . 
  there is *** so much money *** in our politics that only the impossibly naive do n't clearly perceive how thick the corruption is at this point . 
  that could be how we go . 
  it 'd be peaceful but a bit anticlimactic . 
  i 'm really hoping it is n't the result of war . 
  nope , still together . 
  it 'll be 27 years this year . 
  why ? 
  got ta be love , there 's no reasonable explanation why she has n't killed me in my sleep at this point . 
  that would cut into the profits of some very important people who 've spent an awful lot of money to purchase their politicians , so * that 's * certainly not going to happen . 
  i have actually been to the vasa museum , we have friends in stockholm and family in norrk\u00f6ping and gothenburg . 
  i 've been to the flygvapenmuseum too . 
  i served in the us army in germany , so of course , i married a swedish girl . 
  i do n't disagree with that , generally speaking , with the exception of an american being able to succeed from almost nothing , i think those days are pretty much over . 
  i could n't get where i am now if i had to follow the same path i did starting today that i started 30 years ago . 
  bottom end of the 2 % ( you might be looking at a different scale as well ) . 
  our household income is about $ 225k yearly . 
  i recall our lifetime cap prior to the aca being in the $ 1 million range and between all family members , we 'll almost certainly surpass that . 
  our son 's surgeries alone are already over $ 500k ( he 's almost halfway through ) without calculating the cost of my older son 's acl repair a few years ago , my three knee scopes and likely knee replacements and anything else that may arise . 
  the defect is a leg-length discrepancy ( which is more severe given he 's 6 ' 5 '' tall ) plus a congenital absence of the acl and pcl on the same leg ( he was simply born without both ligaments ) . 
  universal healthcare , a single-payer system , would eliminate profit from healthcare . 
  that 's where about 30 % of the problem lies from a purely economic perspective . 
  the aca leaves profit in the equation , which is where and why it was doomed to fail . 
  you need to dig a lot deeper into the disjointed economics of healthcare in the united states . 
  you 'd most likely pay less money for superior care in a universal system of any sort . 
  for starters , none of your tax dollars would go towards paying the profoundly chaotic costs of indigent healthcare . 
  you would n't be paying for profit in healthcare anymore , because that element would be eliminated entirely . 
  more of the money going into healthcare would go towards reimbursing doctors , nurses and specialists so they 'd have more time to spend with patients and more doctors would choose specialties where they 're not constantly under the thumbs of healthcare administration and could simply base decisions on medical data . 
  as to * why * you 'd never vote for it , that 's on you . 
  most folks i know who vote against universal systems do so because they do n't have a clear understanding as to how healthcare works and are disinterested in learning , choosing instead to listen to folks who preach against such systems ( without paying too much attention to the fact that health insurance companies are paying them to say what they say ) . 
  that 's because the us government * ca n't * be trusted . 
  my family 's income puts us in the top 2 % in the united states . 
  we do n't own a private jet , but we really want for nothing . 
  kids can go to school wherever they choose , we 're set for retirement in luxury . 
  my youngest son has a birth defect that requires multiple , complex surgical procedures to repair . 
  with the lifetime caps removed by the aca , we 're in fine shape , we have great health insurance . 
  with the aca gone , we 're absolutely fucked . 
  our choices now will consist of : 1 . 
  do n't finish the procedures to correct our son 's birth defect . 
  deplete our combined retirement funds , completely , bankrupt ourselves paying for the procedures out of pocket . 
  move to europe ( my kids are dual-citizens ) . 
  you 're rolling the dice my friend . 
  bad luck has put our great life in great peril . 
  my swedish brother-in-law , when he was 20 years old and working for the post office , took a three-week vacation to dubai . 
  he now has a masters degree ( or equivalent , i know the verbiage is different ) and is now free to plan extended vacations throughout europe and the us for his entire family . 
  he has chosen to stay with the post office . 
  when i was in my 20 's we were trying to maintain jobs with benefits and pay off student loans ( which we had despite my earning of the gi bill and college fund via us army service ) . 
  we make good money now , so i was able to cover my older son 's college shortfall ( partial scholarship ) at a prestigious university in the northeast to the tune of $ 37k per year . 
  if the us kills the aca entirely , we may be forced to move to europe to complete my younger son 's surgical process because he 's having a very rare birth defect fixed and `` lifetime caps '' on benefits will be reinstated . 
  this means we 'll get to `` nope , good job , good money , company health insurance , but you 're maxed out , no more health insurance for you '' . 
  that insanity . 
  so no , not `` disneyland '' but free from the sort of worry that plagues americans at all but the 1 % plus income percentile . 
  nope , ca n't have that , it disturbs my overly simplistic and fantastically visual imagery and symbolism . 
  i would agree with that entirely . 
  freedom as a concept is often lost when we talk about freedom from concern . 
  worry over healthcare and education is a concern for 80 % plus of americans . 
  for europeans ? 
  it just is n't . 
  poof . 
  it 's like magic . 
  it 's hard for europeans to even grasp that we have to worry about it and we 're rightly viewed as savages for it . 
  it 's also a lie that americans are `` free from paying '' for someone else 's healthcare as well , because we have indigent care programs that are more expensive than actually giving folks healthcare to begin with , or at best a wash , and that 's paid for via state and federal taxes . 
  part of everyone 's taxes here is also going towards grants and subsidized student loans as well , so to a lesser degree , we 're all still paying for education as well , via taxes . 
  wife and i had no choice but to spend our entire lives working towards making more and more money . 
  we did so in order to make enough to give our children the freedom to do what they want . 
  go to the schools and study the fields they chose . 
  we sacrificed so they did n't have to , so that they had choice . 
  your story mirrors ours , we were poorer and worse off , then about equal to the average european , now making more than average . 
  if i had to do it all over again , i 'd probably have chosen to start off with what i perceived at the time as `` less opportunity '' and just stayed in europe . 
  my kids do n't really have it any better off than my nieces and nephews . 
  i have five weeks paid vacation these days , as does the wife , but we 're in positions such that it 's difficult to take more than a week at a time , or our businesses , our teams will start to suffer , so while we now have the money to spend , the time is n't truly our own . 
  we had time when we were in school , but no money . 
  then we had money and no time . 
  now that we have both , it 's not * really * our time to simply use whenever we 'd like . 
  and in europe , we 'd have had the vacation we worked two decades to acquire on day one . 
  yeah , it 's cool to have a big house , big yard with a pond , in-ground pool , nice cars ... but at the expense of what , exactly ? 
  our humanity , if we 're not careful . 
  our caring for our fellow man . 
  i do n't feel * personally * responsible for income inequality in america either , but i 'm beginning to benefit from it to a very small degree ( we 're apparently in the top 2 % income-wise now , apparently ) . 
  y' all packed it in a long while ago though , after vasa and all . 
  `` our glorious flagship ! '', 
  `` is that a wave ? '', 
  `` well , imperialism is all over now , what next ? '', 
  i think it 's difficult for americans to fully grasp the difference if they have n't lived there . 
  my first experience was living in germany when i was in the army in the late 1980 's . 
  a good portion of the soldiers did n't particularly want to be in europe at all and stayed mostly within the american bubble there , which was substantial before the wall fell . 
  they learned and experienced nothing . 
  i signed up for europe as i specifically wanted the opportunity to experience new things and cultures . 
  now , i was pretty dumb still , and young , so a lot of my insight is sort of in retrospect ( things i did n't really pay that much attention to while i was there and they were happening in front of me ) , but what i now realize is that as a soldier , most of my german friends were lower-middle-class type folks with labor-intensive jobs that did n't necessarily pay all that well , but it did n't matter because none of their income was dedicated to healthcare or education ( these things simply were n't concerns for them ) . 
  coming back to america and starting a family here ( i married a swede actually , so i 've been back and forth a lot and have relatives in austria as well as friends in germany still ) is that folks are ** happier ** in europe . 
  that 's one that 's really hard to grasp for folks and impossible really to quantify . 
  i explain it as `` folks do n't have to worry about healthcare breaking them and know that if they 're not necessarily too bright and do n't have a great path towards wealth , one or more of their smart children wo n't be held down due to their own lack of resources '' . 
  in europe , folks have the `` weight of the world '' off their shoulders and they can simply * live their lives * . 
  this is how i try to explain it to folks here in the united states .
