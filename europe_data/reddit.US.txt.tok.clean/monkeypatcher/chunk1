it would be better if it were 1 state . 
  but that 's an american perspective . 
  i would like to see a europe more united than it already is . 
  but i know its hard and maybe unwanted . 
  i hope the eu can create a common sense of unity as happened in ancient greece between the city states . 
  you ca n't buy food with unrealized gains .

  til . 
  i never made the connection between wien and wiener . 
  thanks !, 
  still not sure . 
  are we talking about the hot dogs ? 
  what dick joke ? 
  why do n't they just arrest them ? 
   mate you do n't either . 
  the welfare distribution systems in europe are way more efficient than any of those you 've listed . 
  those programs are wasteful and some are almost counter-productive . 
  in total agreement . 
  i 've forgotten my original point but this all started with the overarching theme that america does not care about poor people . 
  i 'm just showing that as false . 
  even if we 're bad at helping the poor it does n't mean we do n't care . 
   from the statistics i have seen new york is a net contributor in taxes to the usa while mississippi is a net beneficiary . 
  correct !, 
  and completely irrelevant to the point . 
  tax dollars , at the federal level , should provide for the general welfare . 
  a poor person in mississippi should receive the same amount as a poor person in nyc even though nyc 's rich people are paying more taxes . 
  if you find the poor in your area are suffering due to high costs , you can levy additional local taxes to make up the difference . 
  what we do n't want to do is subsidize expensive lifestyles . 
  you do n't want to put 1 person in sf in a $ 3000/mo studio apartment . 
  we would rather put 10 people in mississippi in a $ 300/mo apartment . 
  do you see how more people can be helped this way ? 
  essentially yes . 
  they value the degree more than they value the debt . 
  statistically speaking , accruing debt for a college degree is a good financial decision . 
  most will earn more than they spent . 
  this is a mostly good system because those that use and benefit from the system also fund it . 
  of course there are some who spend $ 200k on less valuable degrees . 
  you hear them complain often and loudly . 
  they are not the majority . 
  most people have less than $ 30k in debt and put their degree to good use . 
  you 're applying a set of biases to me that do n't exist . 
  i 'm not anti-welfare . 
  i 'm pro-welfare and i 'm arguing for the benefits of america 's social safety net in other comment threads . 
   from your mentality i highly doubt you are willing to `` provide assistance '' . 
  how would you possibly end up paying money for someone to live in an expensive city . 
  do you think we should have cities where people of a certain income are not welcome ? 
  on the federal level , i do n't think a person in nyc should receive more welfare than someone living in mississippi . 
  if the people of nyc want to provide additional welfare , i am perfectly happy with their decision to do so but it should n't come at the expense of mississippi tax payers . 
  do you understand my perspective ? 
  if nyc wants additional welfare for their residents then nyc should pay it . 
  surely people take on debt in sweden to purchase homes ? 
  the swedish government is in debt so i know the concept exists in your society . 
  do you save for 20 years to buy a home ? 
  i enjoy reading about european politics . 
  i only replied because they mentioned america . 
   so compassionate . 
  this bugs me more than it should . 
  i 'm sorry you ca n't raise a family of four in san francisco or la or nyc . 
  life is n't fair . 
  why should i pay for someone to live in an expensive city ? 
  live somewhere cheap and i 'm more than happy to provide assistance ... 
   mate , have you ever met or talked to a fiscally disadvantaged person in america ? 
  born to two . 
  was one . 
   it is also way more fucking difficult for a poor person to get their basic needs met in america . 
  which ones ? 
  food ? 
  food stamps . 
  housing ? 
  public housing . 
  healthcare ? 
  medicaid . 
  disability ? 
  ssd . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   charity donations include in their calculations donations to charities that are just as ineffective , if not more so , that government spending . 
  i think you replied to the wrong post . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're referring to . 
   without a livable wage in many places ... then move . 
   what an outrageous copout that is . 
  poor people should stop being poor is basically what you are saying , ignoring that so many things in the system are stacked so incredibly heavily against poor people . 
  lol . 
  no ... if you 're living paycheck to paycheck you can reduce your expenses . 
  its not a copout . 
  if you make $ 8000/mo and you spend $ 8000/mo , you are living paycheck to paycheck . 
  i do n't feel sorry for you at all . 
  if you are making $ 1000/mo and spend $ 700/mo you are * not * living paycheck to paycheck . 
  the survey you cited is bogus , the implications of it are bogus , and you have no basis to claim that the system is stacked against the poor . 
   serious disdain towards homeless people was extraordinarily common unlike any other place i had ever been . 
  i suppose i keep better company than you . 
  i 've never heard those opinions expressed . 
  i do n't think you can call your examples `` extraordinarily common '' but they are unsettling .
