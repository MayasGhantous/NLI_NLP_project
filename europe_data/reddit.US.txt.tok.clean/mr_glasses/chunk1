greeks who converted to islam were called turks , even if they spoke greek . 
  i believe that 's only in the period of the turkish republic . 
  before then , `` turk '' was reserved only for the poor anatolians . 
  rich muslims who spoke turkish were `` ottomans . '', 
  no idea if there were any greek-speaking muslims and what they were called . 
  you 're quite right , of course . 
  just wanted to give credit where credit 's due . 
  many jesuits have been assassinated for their activities for social justice and human rights . 
  good on you for reading all that and managing to stay awake . 
  i ca n't bring myself to read much of it . 
  what do you make of the fact that tolerance seems to vary among islamic societies over space and time ? 
  does n't it behoove us to try to influence conditions that would tend more towards tolerance ( or better still , secularism ) ? 
  right now we 're inadvertently aiding the most backward strains in that religion thanks to our oil money . 
  they have done a lot of good in latin america for human rights against right-wing regimes , actually . 
  and in the us they 're big supporters of social justice movements . 
  yep !, 
  according to peter gay , the way we got the enlightenment/modern science/democratic , secular and pluralistic societies was through the awful and bloody experience of the wars of religion , which gave religious enthusiasm a bad name . 
  thing is , it 's not exactly traditional or inevitable . 
  the saudis and gulf arabs are using their wealth to fund foundations who carry out what amounts to a massive cultural/religious genocide from indonesia to the maghreb , in which local islams are being replaced by wahhabism . 
  why not find a counterweight ? 
  how would you envisage combatting mosques that preach violence and puritanical versions of sharia ? 
  lol . 
  i brought them up because of how they were formed to combat protestantism on an ideological level , among the people . 
  they are sorta kinda liberal these days , btw . 
  at least in the us . 
  there need to be strong , militant , well funded , liberal muslim foundations to wage ideological war against jihadism . 
  like muslim jesuits or something . 
  pro-putin americans include : conspiratards who are on the pseudo-left , liberal-left do-gooders who hate us imperialism ( more neutral than pro ) , the for-real stalinist left , some libertarians ( counterpart to liberal-left who also rightfully dislike us interventionism , but who take it too far and believe russian propaganda ) , conservatives who are naturally inclined towards strongmen who attack `` the fags '' and who humiliate obama , neo-nazis , some right-wing jews ( russian jews in brooklyn , mostly ) , fundie muslims , and traditionalist catholics ( who have a whole end-times our lady of fatima thing about russia ) . 
  mercifully , this is only 10 % of the country . 
  most of us despise him . 
  true . 
  you were beautiful snowflakes who remained innocent pre-christian heathens until like 1720 or something . 
  bless your hearts . 
  the answer is fairly simple : guarenteed basic income . 
  should n't be too much of a problem for europe . 
  for the us , where a slight rationalization of our clusterfuck healthcare system is considered stalinism , we 're fucked . 
  it 's not as though italy does n't have a medieval heritage in architecture . 
  it 's just not as inspiring as france 's . 
  i also prefer antiquity to the middle ages , but you got ta be real here . 
  the italian gothic is way too freaking italian . 
  :d rome * was * important for 1000 years . 
  then it was a cow pasture and quarry/spolia super center for 1000 years . 
  my point is that there is something about the imperial grandeur of paris ( which is ironically very roman ) that you just do n't find * in tact * in italy on such a massive scale . 
  it is there , just in ruins or it 's some sporadic 19th century nonsense that is subsumed by layers of medieval stuff . 
  which is all very romantic and beautiful , just not quite functional . 
  in paris i 'm thinking of the metro , the haussmannian buildings and boulevards , the public monuments and gardens plotted with such amazing expertise and on a huge scale . 
  italian cities never quite recovered from the medieval/hodgepodge/chaotic period like paris did , i do n't think . 
  but i can only speak from my book knowledge about italy , so i 'm at a disadvantage here . 
  ( i 'm actually heading to italy in a month and can not freaking wait . 
  first time there . 
  doing pisa , lucca , florence , siena , rome , naples/sorrento , pompeii , amalfi coast . 
  would love to do fewer cities , but i 'm american and we are vacation-deprived ... sigh . ), 
  i would say they 're equal . 
  and i would add the following demerits for italy : * italy has none of the truly spectacular , soaring gothic cathedrals you find in france . 
  this is a big one . 
  * france has paris . 
  rome is beyond glorious , but it lacks the aesthetic unity and good planning of the french capital , for obvious reasons . 
  ( paris has been an uninterrupted imperial center for centuries . 
  rome had a big , epochal lacuna of deprivation , sieges , irrelevance . ), 
  paris is perhaps what rome would look like had the dark ages not happened . 
  * northern france has good beer . 
  hipsters are a convenient but ultimately powerless and irrelevant scapegoat for the real villain , neoliberalism , that drives gentrification and exploding rents and land values . 
  it 's a testament to the decline of the left that drivel like this gets published so often . 
  thanks . 
  and , yep !, 
  i agree . 
  the analogy to the west i 'd make would be the rise of protestant sects and counter reformation catholic church in europe before/during/after the wars of religion . 
  almost the same thing . 
  destruction of '' '' `` idols '' '' '' and banning of christmas . 
  burning of the protestant translators of the bible at the stake . 
  theocratic states like calvin 's geneva . 
  all that bloodshed eventually led to the enlightenment and secularism ( a century or two later , and requiring a revolution in some instances ) . 
  the funny thing is , after all this murderous , fascist sunnite extremist nonsense the past five or six years , shiite iran looks like a paradise of reason and enlightenment . 
  i agree . 
  and i 'd say the fundamentalism in the muslim world has a mirror in the christian world along evangelicals in the us south , uganda , jamaica , etc. 
  the salient difference being that the west has a large liberal and secular population and institutions to keep them in check . 
  you 're right , but would n't you say islam is going through a particularly militant/puritanical phase ? 
  is the problem multiculturalism , really ? 
  i do n't really see hindus or sikhs or filipino catholics or african christians in europe rioting quite so often as young muslim men . 
  i poop on you . 
  total respect for atat\u00fcrk . 
  laicism is the only way to preserve freedom of conscience . 
  erdo\u011fan seems like a bit of a traitor . 
  his ideas will doom turkey . 
  once you allow religion to control politics , there will be a race to the bottom with the most fundamentalist pieces of shit winning in the end . 
  erdo\u011fan is also a piece of shit for his neoliberalism and turning public parks into shopping malls . 
  fuck that and fuck him . 
  ** do n't ** tell anyone that they 've gained weight or look fat ; it 's the worst thing you can say to an american ; ** do n't ** ever say , `` yes , but where are you * really * from ? '', 
  to non-white americans or white americans , but especially the former ;, 
  my bad !, 
  thought we were just talking about spain . 
  fatima is in portugal . 
  do necessary and spurious have any meaning here ? 
  who decides which is which ? 
  consent comes in with democracy . 
  the problem is a deficit of democracy , not taxation per se . 
  see : american revolution, 
  i live in new york . 
  we have a [ public system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=new_york_city_water_supply_system ) with some of the best water in the country , thanks to the croton aqueduct system that was built in the 19th century by some very forward-thinking city fathers . 
  at the time , it was very controversial , as it required a tax to be levied to pay for it .
