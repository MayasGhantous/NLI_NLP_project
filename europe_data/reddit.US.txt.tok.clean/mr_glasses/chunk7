  it 's lovely , thanks . 
  okay , maybe it 's not the end of the world , but it feels like it sometime . 
  not only paris/nigeria/lebanon terror but the destruction of palmyra . 
  and the fact that these bastards have fans all around the world is deeply disturbing . 
  goodbye civilization . 
  isis is the reformation . 
  protestantism was all about going back to basics , removing innovation , smashing idols , setting up a city on a hill , etc. 
  they need counter reformation and enlightenment . 
  lol . 
  it was n't my idea . 
  you 're much better off as a republic anyway . 
  what i wonder is , who can possibly rule over the arabian peninsula that would be more sane ? 
  the princeling oligarchs are cunts and are our enemies ( well , my enemies ) , but is there any reason to think democracy would not put isis or something like it in power ? 
  ** the people ** are steeped in wahhabist ideology . 
  it would be lovely if iran or turkey could take over , but then the locals would never tolerate it . 
  pity the west obliterated arab seculars during the cold war , eh ? 
  all you fascists bound to lose, 
  can someone give us a rundown of these individuals and their parties , in a no-bullshit way ? 
  what he 's saying is that turkey still has a big , militantly secular constituency . 
  that 's key and you should n't gloss over it in your ( otherwise correct ) critique of erdogan . 
  yea , indeed . 
  it 's totally unselfconscious . 
  but the psychological and social dynamics are very reminiscent of a `` self criticism '' session under mao , as a few writers have noted . 
  to prove your purity , you denounce not only official enemies but also people on your side and occasionally yourself for harboring bourgeois views -- or as it were these days , racist/neocolonialist/islamophobic / zionist/eurocentric views . 
  much of the left has ditched universalism/secularism/free speech and embraced a kind of maoist , third-worldist ideology . 
  muslims = oppressed and colonized victims of imperialist aggression , no matter what . 
  white french cartoonists are the enemy . 
  it 's called telepathy, 
  same tone as donald . 
  what is it about racist authoritarians and lack of humor ? 
  i feel a kinship with it as a new yorker . 
  ( the bridges and bays . 
  except istanbul is much cleaner ! ), 
  i like the nondescript , random , mid-rise apartment buildings , especially the crumbly ones in cihangir . 
  sunni islam traditionally had loads of what we in the christian world would call [ `` saints '' all of their own ] ( http://www.lapidomedia.com/death-and-devotion?page=3 ) ( in muslim terms * wali * `` guardian '' ; plural * \u02beawliya * ) . 
  in the traditional sunni islam of the people , which used to be dominated by sufism , worshippers would visit the graves of the \u02beawliya . 
  they 'd pray there . 
  they 'd hold feasts ( [ * mawlid * ] ( http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2014-05/21/c_133349443_11.htm ) ; birthdays applied to the prophet muhammad and various saints ) nearby , in commemoration of the prophet or wali 's birth , with food , processions and gifts . 
  all that is ending , however , as saudi arabian puritanism is sweeping the muslim world thanks to their money , religious schools and prestige . 
  ( very similar to the rise of the radical puritan protestant oliver cromwell and the banning of christmas celebrations and the destruction of statues and relics of saints in britain and ireland . ), 
  all the local expressions of islam , with their traditions and culture and easy-going tolerance , are dying . 
  there are more important things than commerce , like your country 's natural and manmade patrimony . 
  come on , dude . 
  i 'm an american saying this ... 
  the neglected right half is actually better designed . 
  look at those beautiful if weathered old [ muntins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muntin ) separating the plates of glass on the windows . 
  contrast with the `` security glaze '' one-way finish on the single-pane windows on the left . 
  ( got ta keep thieves out ! ), 
  look at that dumb , toadstool-like turret on the left ( `` i live in a castle ! '' ) . 
  that weird red stripe finishing on the left first-floor in contrast with the honest stucco on the right . 
  the * palace of versailles ost * wrought-iron fence on the left in contrast to the simple but lovely hedge on the right ( i guess you 've got to keep the pig in somehow ) . 
  the section on the right knows it 's a simple , common person 's house . 
  it does n't pretend to be anything else . 
  it 's old and decrepit but was once stately and dignified . 
  it provided a dignified existence to its inhabitants for probably several lifetimes . 
  the section on the left is basically a donald trump voter 's house . 
  money does n't buy class !, 
  in the 19th century , when polish patriots were fighting for their and other countries ' liberty , sympathetic french writers began calling them `` les fran\u00e7ais du nord . '', 
  right-wing populists are quite capable of bloated social spending . 
  do you have no shame at all ? 
  romania is a country like any other , with possibilities and problems . 
  have some respect . 
  its laughable . 
  the more social-democratic countries like canada or denmark are far more in tune with conservative `` family values '' ( as well as liberal , non-heteronormative family values ) than the aggressively capitalist us . 
  i disagree . 
  i do n't see those as all supporting each other . 
  capitalism does n't care if you as a worker have the freedom to have a family life or freedom of speech . 
  but then that 's why i am a leftist !, 
  cheers . 
  what `` right wing '' policies do you mean ? 
  the family and church ? 
  and on the 4th of july !, 
  it 's a pity it was built in the 20th century manner -- for cars , not human beings , with gigantic boulevards and highways and little in the way of vibrant , diverse street life . 
  it 's something both commies and capitalists both believed in , sadly . 
  but there are projects to remedy the situation , like the horrible , oversized parade grounds in central warsaw that are currently used as a parking lot , but will be retrofitted to be a proper , [ urban central square , with human-scaled buildings . 
  they 're probably not orthodox jews , then . 
  what are the qualities you define as european , then ? 
  if turks converted to eastern orthodoxy , would istanbul/constantinople be european for you ? 
  if muslims or buddhists or manichaeans invaded all of europe tomorrow and converted everyone away from christianity ( or , um , godless hedonism ? 
  ) , would paris , london , berlin etc. 
  cease being european ? 
  it comes down to how you define europe . 
  not to mention mixing with the greeks and armenians ... 
  i mean ... the , um , ancient anatolians . 
  it 's absolutely false and ahistorical to say atat\u00fcrk ( `` father of the turks '' ) felt `` cultural cringe '' about his turkishness . 
  if anything , he was too much of a nationalist . 
  note the current ethnic composition of turkey ... 
  this idea that turks `` want to be european '' or pro-admission people consider turks to be european is a contemporary debate -- among europeans , mostly . 
  do n't export it to the early 20th century . 
  of course constantinople / ( part of ) istanbul are european . 
  the ancient greeks came up with the division europe/asia . 
  they applied it to the opposite shores of the aegean/bosphorus/black sea . 
  emperor diocletian even included constantinople in a province he called [ europa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/dioecesis_thraciae_400_ad.png ) . 
  for real . 
  they will regret someday not having invested in east poland . 
  true !, 
  i just want to be careful here . 
  i want to be a partisan for secularism , republic , women 's rights etc. 
  -- everywhere on earth . 
  but i do n't want or need the world to adopt `` western culture . '',
