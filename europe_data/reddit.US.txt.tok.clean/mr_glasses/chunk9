  perhaps muster all your anti-americanism to do the opposite of what we ( and the english ) have done . 
  we in new york have a '' [ continental ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humid_continental_climate ) '' climate . 
  much of western europe has an '' [ oceanic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oceanic_climate ) '' climate . 
  water loses heat slower than land . 
  the ocean functions as a kind of radiator , slowly dissipating heat during the winter . 
  wind moves from west to east . 
  so if you 're on a west coast ( much of europe , parts of chile , california , british columbia ) you get mild air flows all year . 
  if you 're on a east coast ( new york , montreal , hokkaido japan , korea ) you get air that has flowed over land , and , if you are far enough from the equator and in a humid climate , you get more snow and colder temps on average than west coast equivalent at the same latitude . 
  well what is `` the best '' ? 
  and use the best available evidence * to what ends * ? 
  it 's a bit fatuous to say that this rawlsian stuff -- and it alone ; * unlike those dumb leftists !, 
  * -- is ideology-free . 
  *   * \u00a1 o furia intestinal !, 
  *   * con arepas de queso blanco *   * el dolor se distingue ya *   * \u00a1 el dolor se distingue ya !, 
  how is it that when a liberal party ( or as we would say in the us neoliberal/free market/centrist ) does `` whatever is best '' it is free of ideology ? 
  that looks like a p\u0105czek !, 
  * no , [ god attack ] ( https://youtu.be/eoa2lzb3jx8 ), 
  god attack paul ryan, 
  thanks !, 
  all i did was 3 minutes of web research . 
  not too difficult !, 
  yeah ... because `` woetsj '' would make so much more sense . 
  there was this [ amazing display in 2010 ] ( https://youtu.be/7-6ymfxzlim?t=6m00s ), 
  that 's fine . 
  it 's faulty evidence , if you can even call it that . 
  okay ... do you have a paper you 'd like to cite or something besides a simple haplogroup map ? 
  `` tad bit different '' is n't exactly anything interesting . 
  mere regional haplogroup diversity in italy could have emerged 20,000 -- 5,000 years before present for all you know . 
  why do you infer it was the result of germanic invasion ~ 1,500 ya ? 
  any sources ? 
  and i hope you understand the important difference between y-dna and autosomal dna . 
   certainly it is true for mid/southern ... 
  but for northern italy , it is not the case . 
   they used samples from throughout italy . 
  so ... you 're dismissing findings in a paper published in a scientific journal by linking to a single map of y-dna haplogroup diversity in europe . 
  okay . 
  what is it you think you see in that map that is relevant to this discussion ? 
  here is the source i 'm referring to : ralph , peter , and graham coop . 
  `` the geography of recent genetic ancestry across europe . '' ed . 
  chris tyler-smith . 
  plos biology 11.5 ( 2013 ) : e1001555 . 
  pmc . 
  web . 
  8 jan. 2017 :  there is relatively little common ancestry shared between the italian peninsula and other locations , and what there is seems to derive mostly from longer ago than 2,500 ya . 
  an exception is that italy and the neighboring balkan populations share small but significant numbers of common ancestors in the last 1,500 years , as seen in figures s16 and s17s17 . 
  ** the rate of genetic common ancestry between pairs of italian individuals seems to have been fairly constant for the past 2,500 years ** , which combined with significant structure within italy suggests a constant exchange of migrants between coherent subpopulations . 
   [ ... ] we find that france and the italian and iberian peninsulas have the lowest rates of genetic common ancestry in the last 1,500 years ( other than turkey and cyprus ) , and are the regions of continental europe thought to have been least affected by the slavic and hunnic migrations . 
  these regions were , however , moved into by germanic tribes ( e.g. , the goths , ostrogoths , and vandals ) , which suggests that perhaps ** the germanic migrations/invasions of these regions entailed a smaller degree of population replacement than the slavic and/or hunnic ** , or perhaps that the germanic groups were less genealogically cohesive . 
  this is consistent with the argument that the slavs moved into relatively depopulated areas , while ** gothic `` migrations '' may have been takeovers by small groups of extant populations . 
  ** italy has been stable genetically for 2,500 years , which is pretty much all of recorded history for that region . 
  and despite italy having been `` invaded '' multiple times by various foreign groups during the first millennium around the time of the collapse of rome , italians remained italian . 
  that is to say , the invaders were a small cohort of elites who ruled over italian masses . 
  there was no genocide . 
  there was no massive genetic mixture . 
  makes sense if you consider the fact that italians were far richer , more urban , more advanced and numerous than the newcomers . 
  which genetic facts are you talking about ? 
  not trying to be obnoxious amigo . 
  i 've read sources that say otherwise . 
  most of the peopling of europe took place in pre-history , before europeans spoke keltic , romance , germanic , slavic etc. 
  languages and has remained stable since , even as roman , frankish , celtic , hunnish etc. 
  i said mass migration . 
  migration in the millions like we saw in the us , brazil and argentina 100 years ago . 
  that 's not what happened with the germanic invasions in the first millennium . 
  if it did , there would be genetic evidence today . 
  i 've read elsewhere that italy was settled in pre-history and that aside from the greeks in the south and arabs in sicily , no migration in recorded history contributed to the diversity of the peninsula in a major way . 
  rather , the diversity owes everything to the difficult terrain . 
  the alps , apennines and mediterranean preserved little pockets of diversity ( from the initial human settlement through pre-historical migrations ) that in a flatter country would have been smoothed over by the easier flow of people . 
  i think that 's a little crazy . 
  there is nothing in history to suggest that there was a mass genocide of native italians by germanic or semitic invaders . 
  and there was no mass migration of barbarian tribes to replace them . 
  and for , what it 's worth , suetonius said emperor augustus was blond and blue-eyed . 
  italians are `` caucasian . '', 
  they have fewer instances of blond hair than germans , but not 0 % . 
  heck , i even have syrian and egyptian friends who have natural blond hair . 
  i suspect this folk history has everything to do with the medieval/modern history of north italy vs. south italy . 
  there is no reason to suspect that the reason the one is rich and the other poor has to do with racial difference . 
  there are probably simpler explanations , like maybe the south experienced worse , more incompetent foreign domination and was perhaps not as well positioned for industrialization as compared to the north . 
  yep . 
  for most of history , art was about saying , `` hey , the big guy/god in town is fucking amazing . 
  wow !, 
  how great he is . 
  it 's only with the romantic period that we get the vision of the artist as hero opposed to unjust society . 
  hehe , like in [ prisencolinensinainciusol ] ( https://youtu.be/-vsmf9m_nt8 ), 
  i could n't understand what words he was saying . 
  i 'm going to start saying `` porco dio ! '', 
  all the time . 
  :d btw , similar practices exist in spanish and french ( qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ) ex . 
  * \u00a1 me cago en la hostia !, 
  * \u00a1 me cago en dios , la virgen santa y la hostia consagrada !, 
  * hostie !, 
  i do n't understand but it sounds delightful, 
  that 's not true !, 
  there are still people in new york city , buenos aires and s\u00e3o paulo who speak italian . 
  i mean ... they 're mostly old and will die soon . 
  but they 're there !, 
   should n't that be a supreme court decision ? 
  one of the grave deficiencies of the us system ( in stark contrast to france ) is our anti-statism and federalism/hyper-localism . 
  it allows rural/suburban reactionaries to have an over-sized political influence . 
  it 's how we got george w. bush and now trump , with the electoral college . 
  the individual states control educational curricula ( 92 % of funding coming from state and local taxes ) .
