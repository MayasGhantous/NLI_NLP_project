  i strongly support free trade between the us and the eu . 
  i think that ttip is very important , because at the moment the us and eu together make up such a large part of the global market that together we can impose environmental and safety standards pretty much globally . 
  on the other hand , i do n't actually support or oppose the treaty itself at the moment , because i have no way of knowing what it contains . 
  when we find out what it actually calls for , then i 'll form an actual opinion . 
  its slightly more complicated than that . 
  we have a similar amount of xenophobia as europe does by default , but if an immigrant can speak english and owns an american flag , then most toward them xenophobia goes away . 
  they will still have to contend with racism , but also affects people born in the us . 
  about multiculturalism - the us is very accepting of traditions and culture from foreign countries , but not exactly in a multicultural way . 
  instead what happens is two-way integration : immigrants and their children become more and more culturally american , but part of that is because american culture shifts to integrate parts of their native culture . 
  basically , `` integration '' in america means adding both the people and their culture to the melting pot , while integration in europe seems to mean only that `` they should become more like us '' . 
  also , the reason that the us tends to get a lot of `` good '' muslim immigrants is really the same reason that poor people from central america do n't immigrate to europe . 
  since its so much harder for muslims to get here ( because of the ocean ) , only those that are willing to put in a lot more effort come here . 
  there are no us troops in kiev . 
  ashamed : * native american genocide * coups against foreign democracies * spying on citizens of allied countries * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/depopulation_of_chagossians_from_the_chagos_archipelago * turning away refugees during the second world war * torture * police brutality * supporting dictatorships * racists proud : * scientific discoveries and technological advancement * nato , protecting our allies * not gloating in 1989-1991 , when doing so was very tempting but could 've caused a lot of problems * the berlin airlift * our giant economy * advances in gay rights during the past few years, 
  well this title is n't editorialized at all . 
  it does n't seem at all far fetched to me that a portion of them would be welfare abusers , and it * makes sense * that it would be a larger portion than in the native population , but without evidence i ca n't really say that that 's true . 
  even if it is true , i also do n't have any evidence that it is a very large portion ( nor do i know what a very large portion is in this case ) . 
  i do recognize that they take from the native population economically . 
  i do n't see how they can be taking welfare ( as in payments ) that the native population would otherwise be entitled to , unless you mean that if they were not present then services would be better or taxes would be lower . 
  if that is what you mean , i do accept it . 
  if asylum seekers are too expensive for sweden , that does n't really say anything about other countries . 
  sweden takes in far more asylum seekers per capita than any other oecd country . 
  this article has a chart made from oecd data : http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/dec/02/sweden-oecds-highest-per-capita-asylum-seekers-syria in this particular case the situation in sweden tells us very little about the situation in other european countries . 
  but where is the evidence that they ca n't afford their welfare systems because of asylum seekers ? 
  if that is true then it definitely would negatively affect the native population . 
  so where do you get the idea that half of all the tax dollars that go toward social security go to benefits seekers ? 
  that is a rather specific claim to make without a source . 
  the president of the ecb is elected by the european council through qvm . 
  i assume you can provide a source ? 
  the listed cost for us health care is much higher than the insurance company actually pays . 
  who 's ndt ? 
  we also have the most wonderful industry in the world - for-profit prisons !, 
  ^ ( seriously though , prisons are something that should never be privatized and the for-profit prison industry is evil , though it is only a contributing factor to the massive incarceration rate . ), 
  it seems logical that the esa should be the first to actually land something on europa . 
  interest rate went from 3.087 % to 0.766 % . 
  estonia meets the target too . 
  that is just how article titles always work . 
  `` the us said '' , `` israel demands '' , `` iraq asks '' ; all refer to the governments . 
  no , 458 / ( 8 * 4 * 3 ) = `` police shootings are bad in the us '', 
  yes , police shootings are bad in the us . 
  but the chart is very misleading , since the us also has four times the population . 
  here they are : https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4621.html as you can see , trade is significantly lower compared to the same time last year . 
  correct . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the us has provided more than $ 4 billion in financial aid to ukraine as well as several hundred million in material aid . 
  how do get `` wo n't commit anything '' from that ? 
  and the us would n't bail out greece . 
  it might be willing to provide loans or grants to meet certain debt payments though . 
  no really an equivalent situation : us constitution , article 1 , section 10 , clause 3 :  ** no state shall ** , without the consent of congress , lay any duty of tonnage , keep troops , or ships of war in time of peace , ** enter into any agreement or compact ** with another state , or ** with a foreign power ** , or engage in war , unless actually invaded , or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay . 
  the eu does not have a similar rule . 
  also , i 'm only trying to say that he should ask the us before asking russia , not that he should ask either at all . 
  last card ? 
  greece is a nato member spending 2 % of gdp , and tsipras is asking russia for help before asking the us !, 
  he does n't have to be a russian shill to be upvoted by them . 
  there is no limit . 
  two-bladed mobility broom fighting-part ? 
  in the us , the federal government funds unemployment insurance for states that have very high unemployment , and other states pay for their own unemployment insurance . 
  that system would probably help in the eu as well , but it * would * require a major political and policy shift . 
  it might require some kind of fiscal union , which is what the us has . 
  near latvia , obviously . 
  thank you !, 
  ah , good point . 
  then maybe welfare payments \\* unemployment should stay below the eu average edit : never mind , i do n't think that helps . 
  ** unemployment / welfare payments ** might work though . 
  but americans actually do that . 
  when i go on vacation : `` oh , you 're from minnesota ? 
  do you know steve ? 
  he 's a junior at st. 
  thomas . '', 
  minnesota has 5.5 million people and is half the size of germany . 
  so rather than having an independent neo-nazi battalion , it will be subordinated to the state ? 
  that is actually good news , since it gets the battalion under control . 
  there is basically nothing else short of an attack that the ukrainian government could have done to remove them as an independent actor . 
  germany paid half of its debt . 
  greece received relief from almost a third of its debt , and also received a huge amount of money as loans . 
  on the other hand , one aspect of the agreement where germany received 50 % debt relief should be considered for greece : cap payments at 3 % of gdp yearly ; to make that fair , though , that would only apply while greece 's ppp adjusted per-capita welfare payments are below the eu average . 
  also , receiving the 430 million reichsmarks of the forced loan would n't be very helpful , since you ca n't pay for things using reichsmarks anymore . 
  if you 're hungary , then why did n't you finnish your turkey ? 
  that makes sense , but i 'm wondering if they should have asked the us congress for help modernizing the planes , given greece 's financial situation ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that , due to the current geopolitical situation in eastern europe and the fact that greece is a nato ally , congress would have been willing to authorize a loan , or even a grant , to cover at least a portion of the cost and would almost certainly have been willing to cover most of the down payment . 
  edit : i mean that `` given greece 's financial situation '' is what they should tell congress , though it id also a good reason to ask in the first place . 
  how many civil wars do you want to start ? 
  see , that 's the trick . 
  we do n't sue him , we sue the bananas . 
  ^ ( that is actually how civil forfeiture works . 
  its stupid , but produces some great case names . ), 
  anderson argues that * nations * are imagined communities , mostly based on language but also sometimes on other things either in addition to or in place of language . 
  by `` imagined community '' he means that the community exists because its members share things like a vision of their homeland , but more importantly because its members believe that they belong to the community . 
  by `` nation '' he does not mean france , poland , or hungary ; but rather the french , polish , and hungarians . 
  he does not really challenge the idea that a nation is the foundation of a modern state . 
  if you look at his post history , you 'll see that he is actually a fascist ( not as an * ad hominem * , he actually seems to be a fascist or neo-nazi ) who is scared of brown people . 
  latvia needed a bailout during the financial crisis . 
  it was several years ago , and latvia has replayed almost all of the money they were loaned . 
  and in germany last year : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/07/german-supermarkets-cocaine-banana-crates-berlin, 
  indeed . 
  the carrot thing is a bit odd , but apparently only relates to making jam . 
  and it is n't the strangest thing about that directive . 
  the snail-as-fish rule should be blamed on the french , because they lobbied for the commission to decide that snails are `` inland fish '' so that french snail farmers ( which are apparently a thing , since the french consume a lot of snails ) could be subsidized in the same way fisheries are . 
  yeah . 
  i was just explaining why that flag might look like something the nazis would 've come up with , not where the black cross comes from .
