  from wikipedia : 1.175 trillion ( april 2015 ), 
  from russia 's wikipedia page ... 1.175 trillion ( april 2015 ), 
  the ussr had more people , but in the 50s & 60s , the us economy was probably 3x or 4x larger ( though they probably overestimated the soviet economy ) . 
  the ussr was growing fast but not fast enough to catch up , by 1989 the us economy was * only * 2x larger , but by then , japan ( a us ally ) was the second largest economy , not the ussr, 
  * `` everyone thought the ussr 's economy would surpass the us '' * ... really ? , their economy never came close to the size of the us economy , i think japan had a larger economy than russia by the 1980s, 
  i think russia has now fallen below the 1 trillion mark in nominal gdp ... that means they rank 16th in the world , behind * mexico *, 
  many countries in the eu ( eastern europe , mostly ) are still socially conservative, 
  * `` if you 're aware that it was justified , why are you bringing it up as an example of russia `` expanding '' ? 
  '' * ... because the poster said that nato was `` expanding '' ... . 
  * `` strange , since both the eu and un found russia justified in its offensive in georgia . 
  but hey , you do n't need facts , do you ? 
  '' * ... i never said it was n't justified ( where did i say that it was n't justified ? ) . 
  but nato is also justified to expand if a country wants to join, 
  russia in 2008 , occupied georgia , and now eastern ukraine . 
  they are expanding , so is nato . 
  but the difference is , nato is * invited * into a country . 
  reagan smash !, 
  it goes both ways ... * nato * has every right to feel threatened and build up militarily , as * russia * is right on their borders, 
  the uk has the 5th largest economy in the world , far from a `` mid-sized economy '' . . britain is still a significant world power, 
  poland and the baltic states are uncomfortable with germany 's relations with russia . 
  they think germany is too soft on russia . 
  * `` it would not make sense in any political , strategical , economical , any way that i could think of . 
  it 's plain stupid . 
  '' * ... that did n't stop them from invading ukraine ... 
  the population ( at least in eastern europe ) does want us protection , they simply do n't trust the french or germans . 
  so , he takes bordering regions ... not that big of an accomplishment , really ... 
  that 's probably the most powerful hq in the world, 
  what a dumb list , i guess kim jong un is the most powerful person if you 're going by which dictator with nuclear weapons has absolute control of his country, 
  russia is losing power , the only reason they had to intervene in ukraine is because their puppet was pushed out , they lost ukraine . 
  they gained crimea , but now most of ukraine is in the west 's sphere of influence , where there was none before . 
  italy ? 
  you could argue right before ww1 there were many great powers , with germany , the us , the british empire being `` superpowers '' . 
  i would say they fit that definition, 
  as of now , there 's only one superpower ... 
  britain it 's self is still a great power . 
  it 's still the 3rd largest economy in the world, 
  soon the british will operate 2 `` super-carriers '' ... the biggest outside the usn . 
  the uk is still a world power ... with a strong navy perhaps only second to the usn, 
  that 's not my point ... japan and germany are world powers , but with no real military they 're weaker than france , uk , russia , etc. 
  no , that 's not how it works . 
  look at russia for example , smaller economy than italy and australia ... but russia is much stronger than both of those countries , mainly because of russia 's large military . 
  the uk also has a very large economy and the 4th largest navy in the world . 
  germany is certainly an economic powerhouse , but again its military can not project any power at all . 
  so by your logic , germany is more powerful than russia ? ... 
  germany has no military , they are not a bigger power ... britain on the other hand still has a respectable military . 
  well , it could be more . 
  the ypg are the only ground forces we can truly work with , it would be useless to strike anywhere else . 
  well , the kurds , without heavy weapons & tanks have done much better than the iraqi government ( with helicopter , planes , tanks , us support ) , so who knows ... 
  the ypg would n't have advanced without us airstrikes . 
  it 's not a coincidence that they started to push [ isis out of kobane once the airstrikes started ] ( http://www.agathocledesyracuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kobane-28-jan-2015-am-by-@desyracuse.png ) ... 
  how ? 
  are you ignoring the significant ypg advances in northern syria ? 
  or are you this uninformed ? 
  [ october 2014 ] ( https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-emrftoookhraox9zdcvpjmfg8=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2328430/syria_map.0.png ) . . [ now ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/syrian_civil_war.png/570px-syrian_civil_war.png ) ... the us airstrikes have been far more effective . 
  the us has been supporting the kurds for well over a year ( 60 % + of all airstrikes in syria are in direct aid of the ypg ) . 
  without us airstrikes , isis would control kobane , and most of rojava . 
  oh yes the free dictatorships of china & russia that do no wrong . 
  the russians just bombed a hospital in syria , not on purpose , mistakes happen . 
  china has no freedom of the press , along with russia ... just look at how they treat their own citizens . 
  fine , the us wants to protect the baltics ( & the rest of europe ) , for our own interests , we would n't do it if it did n't benefit us . 
  what do you mean `` apparently not '' ? 
  the majority of the people overwhelmingly want us/nato support to deter russia . 
  what ? 
  that makes zero sense . 
  the baltic states want us support ... 
  yes , but they are still free from state . 
  fox and msnbc here in america represent completely different views ... fox will manipulate viewers and bash obama & others will bash the right wing , it 's just how the media is . 
  there will never be neutral news sources without bias . 
  wow 1 article !, 
  there are many newspapers . 
  many different opinions, 
  what about them ? 
  western media is not owned by the state . 
  there are many opposing view points , sure they can be bias , but many times the press does good things like uncover scandals and corruption . 
  you simply wo n't see that in state owned media . 
  there is a difference between free media with a bias vs state controlled media that is simply a mouthpiece of a regime . 
  so nato should give eastern europe to russia . . just because of some ( made up ) verbal agreement ... lol, 
  the us surpassed the british empire economically , just before ww1 . 
  if the british empire remained in tact ( impossible ) , it would probably be tied for 1st today . 
  ( mainly because of the developing countries like india , pakistan , etc ) . 
  [ here you can see historical gdp ] ( http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5410afdd69bedd8a035253c3-480/top-global-economies.jpg ) ( in ppp so it 's proabaly not the most accurate ) surprisingly the british empire had the 2nd largest economy well into the cold war . 
  so . . pre ww1 . . and ww2 ? 
  history shows that a multi-polar world is n't exactly peaceful . 
  china is an authoritarian state . 
  they also prop up north korea ... 
  the f-35 will actually save money in the long run , as jets get older they cost more to maintain and newer f-15s , f-16s , f-18s , etc , cost just as much as a new f-35 . 
  in 20 days isis expanded in the areas that russia was bombing ... in nearly all the areas the us had an allied ground force to work with , isis was either pushed back significantly or at least contained ... 
  except that isis has gained even more ground in the north from the rebels . 
  saa 's gains still pales in comparison to the ypg gains in the north, 
  not in syria , if that 's what you mean . 
  there has been little gains by the saa ... the us coalition air campaign has shown much better results , albeit the coalition has been bombing for a year . 
  the russians , only 20 days . 
  at least i hope not . 
  not in a dragged out conflict , eventually nato would overwhelm russia in any conventional war . 
  i think people have short term memory loss , now the war is unpopular , but at the time there was no option . 
  the american people wanted to go after al-qaeda and al-qeada was protected by the taliban ... what else could have been done ? ... i think the poster would feel differently if it was their country that was victim of the deadliest terrorist attack in history ... 
  you were against afghanistan and kosovo ? 
  why ? 
  nato was probably the only thing that guaranteed the former eastern bloc , protection from russia ... you 're very naive to think that russia would n't be putting `` little green men '' in estonia or latvia right now ... 
  i love when nato `` expands '' , seeing russia get angry about it is hilarious .
