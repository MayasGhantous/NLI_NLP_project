  ca n't blame them , to be honest . 
  no , i am simply pointing out that muslim population is not directly proportional to islamic terror attacks . 
  they all have radical islam involved . 
  the same could be said for any other rare cause if death -- someone who 's spouse died of teburculolsis would not be able to look at things objectively either . 
  berlin , muslim population ~ 10 % : 1 attack in 2016 jakarta , muslim population ~ 85 % ,1 attack in 2016 muscat , muslim population  95 % , 0 attacks 2016 san bernardino , muslim population 0.061 % , 1 attack 2015 orlando , muslim population 1.13 % , 1 attack 2016 yeah i 'm not really seeing the connection, 
   first they let a truck drive into a crowd tbh there 's really nothing they could have done about that, 
  seriously , putin is no fun , but this guy is waaaay less fun . 
  just a straight up nationalist . 
  no thanks . 
  important perspective , right there . 
  hmm , not sure i have a good answer to that . 
  i consider most antifa movements to be far left , and since the antifa guy in the video is attracted to the kurds because it 's a `` real revolution '' i assumed they must be similarly leftextreme . 
  but i 'm pretty uninformed . 
  fascinating . 
  i guess i 'm just wondering why kurds seem to be so far left ? 
  was there a famous kurd a while back who far a leftist and left an impression on people ? 
  where does this tradition come from ? 
  can someone explain why it is that leftextreme people tend to gravitate towards kurdistan ? 
  ... i 'm gon na go throw up . 
  should put a nsfl tag on that sub . 
  why yes . 
  yes it is . 
  i dunno i think kids would murder [ this flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/flag_of_zheleznogorsk_%28krasnoyarsk_krai%29.png ) , but it 's pretty bad ass, 
  this was what struck me as well . 
   not even the catholics believe the bible if free of error i invite you to come to the us and experience evangelical christianity  find me one muslim , one , that publicly and literally affirms that those verses in quran are bullshit , that there are errors in it and that the quran should not be taken literally . 
  [ here 's one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ludovic-mohamed_zahed ) and [ here 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_and_progressive_muslim_movements ) a wikipedia article detailing liberal muslim movements all over the world and mentioning quite a few . 
  killing and brutalizing gays ways not too uncommon just half a century ago in the christian world , and but the scriptures have now been widely re-interpreted . 
  the same can happen for islam . 
   beautiful fierce woman . 
  and no lady !, 
  only ukrainians have ukrainian passports . 
  i dunno , that can still be very damaging . 
  what do you say to the kids who did n't choose to come and are just along for the ride ? 
  just say `` sorry , you do n't have a future '' -- or what ? 
  not even trump has suggested that illegal immigrants should be denied education . 
  the real talk , here . 
  please, 
  the logic is : * chaos after resignation , if they ca n't agree on an interim government , they 'll hold early elections * the five star movent , having been the most vocal backer of the `` no '' , could make it 's way into office * they have promised make a euro referendum so while it 's certainly not a definite thing , it * is * a plausible outcome . 
  while technically you 're right , look at all the polls from before the first round ( the phase of the french election we are currently in ) . 
  only 1 out of 11 polls has numbers within 10 percentage points of the actual result . 
  nobody took hofer seriously at all until that vote and everyone was absolutely astounded that he blew everyone else out of the water because the polls did n't reflect reality . 
  le penn is part of a right-wing populist party just like hofer , and they have , in the past year , only time and time again shown that they outperform polled results . 
  if le penn is already doing this good , i suspect she 'll again outperform when the actual vote goes by . 
  this is what everyone thought in austria and hofer ended up losing by like .1 % , and will likely win the re-vote in a few weeks . 
  remember brexit . 
  remember trump . 
  the fight is not over . 
  never get complacent . 
  let me have my fun, 
  hmmm , something seems a bit omi\u0161 about this photo ... 
  try 39 : https://www.thelocal.ch/20141014/us-expat-denied-swiss-citizenship-after-39-years-residency, 
  it 's happened to americans as well : https://www.thelocal.ch/20141014/us-expat-denied-swiss-citizenship-after-39-years-residency however , her being of turkish decent certainly could not have * helped * . 
  especially asking her questions about her religion and the political situation of a country which she has never lived in ( turkey ) makes it seem like the council may have come in with some prejudices . 
  in any case it 's absurd that someone who was born in a country and has lived there for 25 years did not have citizenship , let alone be * denied * it . 
  you 're right , but remember how far we 've come in so little time -- in the 90s lgbt people were still not allowed to naturalize as us citizens . 
  http://q13fox.com/2017/04/26/72000-means-youre-low-income-in-king-and-snohomish-county/ example, 
  nobody would have believed the stuff about jimmy savile back then either . 
  does n't take people from the middle east . 
  africa is supposed to add 1.3 billion between 2015 and 2050 . 
  still , that 's a shit ton of people . 
  apparently it was actually a known ukrainian prankster : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitalii_sediuk he knew what flag to wear , though -- nobody would question for a second that the guy was n't australian, 
  i 'm not saying they 're not overrepresented in specific cases . 
  but , in general , there is not a strong connection between immigration and crime , and your post just linking to the article on immigration and crime makes it seem like this indeed a trend -- when it 's not , in general . 
  larger sample size . 
  i would suggest you read the first paragraph of that article, 
  lived here 23 years , can honestly say i 'd never even heard of fleet week . 
  and my dad was in the navy lol only military hardware i 've seen on display is at dream machines in the bay area , but that 's all really old stuff ( like b-52s ) . 
  there is definitely a lot of military worship here in the states ( which is why i said i was surprised we do n't have holidays like v day ) but yeah , we really do n't also the thing is vienna was 100 % a recruitment thing -- they had large screens playing videos of conscripts talking about their good experiences , etc. 
  how many european countries have military holidays were military hardware is displayed/flaunted ? 
  we do n't have any such holidays at all in the states . 
  which , to be honest , kind of surprises me , but i like that we do n't . 
  i was in vienna on their national day in fall and i was really , really surprised that in front of the hofburg they had a * huge * military display with tanks , rockets , etc -- you could even hold a bazooka . 
  have to say i found the whole thing in bad taste . 
  thoughts ? 
  i believe that 's already illegal in most countries, 
  i 'd agree with all but sexual assault . 
  doctors touching genetals = / = sexual assault . 
  yep !, 
  yeah 100 % certainty that the young people are gone . 
  they 're always the first to go . 
  you 're just jealous that ours do, 
  i mean there was nothing * awful * , but there was definitely a lot of stuff that made them look bad -- mainly the language they used to describe people . 
  i mean sure , we have been for years . 
  that should have been clear to anyone who 's visited ukraine since 2000 . 
  the us and russia have been fighting a `` war '' for influence there since putin , essentially . 
  european countries could always go for the chinese model for christianity , lol : make a very tightly controlled state-sponsored church and ban all the rest https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianity_in_china#contemporary_people.27s_republic_of_china edit : this was an example of an absurd suggestion , meant to show the slippery slope of state control of religion, 
  just went over the t_d and checked their thread . 
  i will never understand how people with different opinions can appear to be literally living in another world . 
  some of the most upvoted posts here are talking about how le pen had no real plan and just attacks macron for the sins of the past government . 
  over there , one of the most upvoted posts is taking about * literally the exact opposite * . 
  how ? 
  well we 'll say the non-warzone areas in europe are safer , then . 
  sound reasonable ? 
  they know that because it started happening . 
  the vast majority of the boats used are rubber dinghies ( i 'm sorry i ca n't spell that ) that have no sos signals and could never , ever actually make the journey . 
  they tell the migrants that 's a short journey . 
  i can tell you that very few would actually risk it if they knew what they were getting themselves into -- even with constant rescues the survival rate is not good . 
  i agree that something should be done to keep from encouraging this huge , awful industry -- but there are no good options . 
  we ca n't brings the boats back -- almost none of them are from libya , they have no money to go home , and no way to work there . 
  if we ever expect libya to become a functioning country , we ca n't just fill them up with people they ca n't support .
