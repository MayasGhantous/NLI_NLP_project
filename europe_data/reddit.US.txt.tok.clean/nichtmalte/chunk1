what country is n't rife with corruption , populism , or authoritarianism on some degree ? 
  there 's bosnia and herzegovina , albania , kosovo , kuwait , lebanon , tunisia , and probably some others . 
  norway is not a post-soviet state with a population disenchanted by the end of the ussr . 
  there are many more factors than religion . 
  it 's not as simple as you 're making it , and even among authoritarian states there are huge differences . 
  there 's much more in common between azerbaijan and belarus than azerbaijan and saudi arabia . 
  it is a former turkish province . 
  eh , some groups in russia and romania , maybe . 
  on the whole i do n't think they do very much because it 's just too much of a hassle for little reward . 
  i would n't be so quick to wish oil upon them.there 's a great quote about armenia , which is in a very similar situation politically and historically to that of moldova : `` god , after all , must love the armenians ; he gave them no oil . '', 
  this is a reference to armenia 's neighbor azerbaijan , whose oil wealth has enabled the azerbaijani government to become authoritarian and repressive . 
  transnistria , confusingly enough , is n't a socialist country , nor does it claim to be . 
  [ just look at the communist party 's representation in the transnistrian parliament . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/supreme_council_ ( transnistria \\ ) ) the flag is merely the result of soviet nostalgia . 
  the belarussian flag is a similar situation . 
  the east is a delicate matter , my friend , and we must be careful not to generalize . 
  poor moldova , nobody cares about moldova :(, 
  someone from indiana is a hoosier . 
  do n't ask me why . 
  are you claiming that they would n't be at all successful without russia ? 
  but that does n't mean they 're just russian puppets , as the article is suggesting . 
  i 'm no admirer of vladimir putin ( far from it ) , but this article seems to be making the dangerous suggestion that the rise of far right populists in america and europe is caused more by the intervention of a malevolent russian regime than by internal factors . 
  this absolves responsibility , in a sense . 
  it implies that our countries should be working to combat this apparent russian threat rather than addressing the issues that are actually causing the rise of right-wing extremism . 
  fair enough , but it seems like a stretch . 
  it would be like considering [ john reed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_reed_ ( journalist \\ ) ) to be russian , for instance . 
  even though he lived in the rsfsr for a while , played a role in the government , and died and was buried there , i do n't think anyone would call him russian or soviet . 
  or swiss . 
  he kept his swiss citizenship until he died . 
  and he was never an israeli citizen . 
  i do n't know that he ever even went to israel . 
  nope , that position goes to julius caesar , [ apparently ] ( http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/rankings/people/all/all/-4000/2010/h15 ), 
  he was as swiss as he was american . 
  i mean a source that immanuel kant had russian citizenship, 
  really ? 
  do you have a source ? 
  yeah , i understand , but it just seems like a bad method . 
  kant was n't russian in any meaningful sense . 
  but ... kant was born in k\u00f6nigsberg / kaliningrad which was part of prussia at the time . 
  although , interestingly , [ kaliningrad 's biggest university ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immanuel_kant_baltic_federal_university ) is named after him . 
  i have a cool book with a bunch of pictures like this called `` a day in the life of the soviet union '', 
  romania actually had a nuclear weapons program under ceausescu, 
  that 's how it 's capitalized on the sign . 
  like pis . 
  it 's clever . 
  this shit, 
  russia will have a ridiculous number of nuclear weapons regardless of how good its economy is . 
  they are relatively cheaper and easier to maintain than a large conventional armed forces . 
   with a demographic majority that wants to see my peaceful nation destroyed . 
  that 's a pretty serious accusation . 
  could you back that up ? 
  well i hope you 're enjoying one of the world 's highest standards of living as you wish ill on the economy of a country that has one-fourth of your gdp per capita . 
  why is it bad ? 
  the dutch, 
  i thought that was his job already, 
  basically the world is fucked but nobody wants to admit it, 
  thats also why there were so many in the ussr , because most of the western bit used to be part of poland-lithuania . 
  they 're from a series of [ soviet short animated films ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gena_the_crocodile_ ( film % 29 ), 
  and russian communists, 
  yes, 
  not most of the balkans . 
  why did greece do so much worse than its neighbours ? 
  can sealand please join the eu, 
  0/10 no independent romansh state, 
  also it 's illegal for germany to expand its territory , per the [ treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_final_settlement_with_respect_to_germany ), 
  were other yugoslav languages options for second language studies ? 
  could a slovenian-speaker learn macedonian in school ? 
  now it 's just turkey and u/euromonic . 
  i 'm surprised nobody in kaliningrad knows russian / s also , interesting that they included macedonia for some reason but not the other non-eu balkan countries . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/gefuehlte-wahrheit-deutsche-schaetzen-anteil-der-muslime-viel-zu-hoch-a-1125901.html ) ( auf deutsch ) the red column is the average estimate of the percent of muslims in a country by that country 's surveyed citizens , and the green column is the actual percentage . 
  hopefully the names of the countries wo n't need translations . 
  all satnav systems also rely on government funding . 
  i do n't see how catalonia 's situation is fundamentally different than algeria 's . 
  but i see that you mean , so let 's define a colony as an overseas region lacking self-determination . 
  fission itself is n't a relativistic process , but the relativistic energy equation ( e = \u03b3mc ** 2 ) predicts how much energy is released from fission . 
  in algeria ( as in french guyana ) , after wwii , the entire population was granted french citizenship and all the legal rights therein entailed . 
  however , much like black people in the usa at the time , native algerians were still informally discriminated against in the french legal system and there were ethnic tensions between the french and the arabs . 
  and most importantly , french algeria did not have the right to self-determination . 
  they were only granted an independence referendum in response to a guerilla war waged by pro-independence militants . 
  portugal was a fascist dictatorship at the time , so mozambicans and angolans were equal to the european portuguese in that they were equally powerless . 
  again , no right to self-determination . 
  i guess in summary i think that the lack of self-determination should be a criterion for what constitutes a colony . 
  angola and mozambique were fully incorporated into portugal , and algeria was fully incorporated into france , before they got independence . 
  what about electricity generated from nuclear fission ? 
  what , and leave poor moldova all alone with ukraine ? 
  eh , some might 've . 
  he appealed to the fact that russians felt disenchanted with the new crony-capitalist political and economic system under yeltsin . 
  this is pretty similar to how trump and the european right-populists garnered support . 
  or the russians , who , in classic russian fashion , hit 2016 a bit early in 2000 . 
  what 's the source of that ? 
  is there any desire to `` give it back '' , then ? 
  what are you on about ? 
  i was trying to make a joke, 
  is there a subreddit for these kind of irredentist maps ? 
  i 'm utterly opposed to but oddly fascinated by these irredentist claims, 
  you mean [ east germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_germany ), 
  the eastern bit of interwar poland annexed by the ussr, 
  can you reference some specific passages from it that prove my point wrong ? 
  i do n't mean to argue , i 'm genuinely interested .
