  be fair , now . 
  who said anything about tradition ? 
  i swear to god , norway . 
  it 's * decorative . 
  he just told you . 
  it 's decorative . 
  the chinese were wrong about interesting times . 
  this shit is off the chainnnnnn . 
  2014 guy has eyebrows ; 2017 guy does not . 
  imo , they just look similar . 
  it happens . 
  i agree . 
  basically , i would hope to give individuals as much freedom as possible in the area of dress , but there are certain situations x , y , and z where the fact that you are there , in that location , obliges you to a level of social interaction not possible with your face covered . 
  you ca n't wear a motorcycle helmet in a courtroom , you ca n't wear a ski mask to school , etc. 
  we are talking about the full-face veil , after all , not the hijab . 
  invite him to a french beach , see what happens . 
  [ joke about living vicariously ], 
  see ? 
  public opinion polling reflects what 's in the headlines . 
  the public has the memory of a gnat . 
  ignoring hague rulings ? 
  really . 
  not dangerous . 
  tell that to the philippines . 
  china has ** militarily occupied ** the scarborough shoals , phillippine territory , since 2012 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scarborough_shoal_standoff the hague has ruled against them multiple times , and they refuse to leave . 
   on tuesday , an international tribunal soundly rejected beijing 's extensive claims in the south china sea , an area where china has been building islands and increasing its military activity . 
   the case before the international tribunal in the hague was brought by the philippines , challenging what 's widely seen as a territorial grab by beijing . 
  the tribunal essentially agreed . 
  beijing immediately said the decision was null and void and that it would ignore it . 
  [ -- npr ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/07/13/485753054/will-hague-tribunals-south-china-sea-ruling-inflame-u-s-china-tensions ) their militarization of the south china sea ( seriously , [ look at the map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/south_china_sea_claims_map.jpg ) ) -- rightful international waters -- represents the largest territorial expansion since wwii . 
  `` they just want peace and stability '' is an internet meme with no basis in reality . 
  by the way , you know what the value of the scs is ? 
  in case you did n't look at the map , it is the sea route from japan/korea/taiwan to europe . 
  china now controls their trade with europe , because they do n't listen to international courts . 
  not dangerous . 
  you 're right about one thing , though . 
  it was completely predictable that china would not give two fucks what the hague thought . 
  oh , come off it . 
  public opinion polling is about what 's been in the headlines . 
  if you know anything about china , you know the last thing they are is trustworthy . 
  they sign accords , and then they do n't stand by their word . 
  the us is one of the few countries ( relatively - not saying it 's rare in europe , rather the rest of the world ) that leaves agreements it does n't intend to stand by . 
  example : the cfc ban ( montreal protocol , ratified by all 197 un nations , including china ) . 
   however , there are current cfc smuggling issues , as recognized by the united nations environmental programme ( unep ) in a 2006 report titled `` illegal trade in ozone depleting substances '' . 
  unep estimates that between 16,000 -- 38,000 tonnes of cfcs passed through the black market in the mid-1990s . 
  the report estimated between 7,000 and 14,000 tonnes of cfcs are smuggled annually into developing countries . 
  asian countries are those with the most smuggling ; ** as of 2007 , china , india and south korea were found to account for around 70 % of global cfc production ** , [ 10 ] south korea later to ban cfc production in 2010 . 
  [ 11 ] if you want to criticize the us , by all means . 
  enjoy yourself . 
  but do n't tell me china is the better actor on the world stage . 
  they violate agreement after agreement , on the environment , on trade , on everything . 
   ban foreign funding of mosques ... 
  they 'll just use a proxy . 
  often a hint from the men asked to plan the operation . 
  there are others , but i forget their names . 
  i hear you guys have a couple dutch battalions ( tanks ? ), 
  in the bundeswehr . 
  maybe a czech one too . 
  why not skip the eu ? 
  just do it yourself . 
   what i heard mcdonald 's it 's seen as a cheap restaurant chain you can do it two ways , really . 
  combo meal : `` gim me a # 1 with medium fries and a large coke . '', 
  here , a # 1 is always a big mac . 
  depending on what size fries you get , it can be from $ 6-something to $ 7-something . 
  a-la-carte items off the dollar menu , which is super cheap . 
  not everything is literally a dollar . 
  a small fry is like $ 1.29 . 
  but what i do when i 'm broke is get two double hamburgers ( 2 x $ .99 ) and a coke ( $ .99 ) which comes to $ 3.18 after tax . 
  our `` regular '' restaurants are more expensive than yours , though , from what i hear . 
  you ca n't go to a decent place and get a whole meal for like $ 9 here like you can in germany . 
  more like $ 15 or $ 20 . 
  i do n't doubt it for a minute . 
  shows you the power of branding , i guess . 
  really , though ? 
  mcdonald 's * because of a holiday ?

  look , i 'm not trying to be prideful of mcdonald 's or whatever , but that 's not how it is in the us . 
  the burgers taste the same anywhere in the country . 
  that was their # 1 goal in growing the business : deliver the same experience in every mcdonald 's . 
  9 hours in . 
  i 'll be the fast food elitist . 
  the mcdonald 's i had at a german airport was confusingly bad . 
  our wage slaves would get fired for serving people what they served me there . 
  i could n't even eat it . 
  if the airport mcdonald 's was representative of european mcdonald 's generally , op 's friend is 110 % correct . 
   i doubt they 're any happier to have him in charge than europe though phhhh . 
  i reiterate : europe , you are not the world . 
  obama was weak on china . 
  he rolled over to them , especially in the scs . 
  we have a 250-year history of defending freedom of navigation , and he dropped it like a stone . 
  no more . 
  you have to understand , the enmity between china and japan is such that chinese officials bring up our pacific fleet commander 's `` blood '' ( he 's half japanese ) in public , on the record , to explain his actions . 
  according to the japan times , they even asked trump to fire him . 
  you just could n't be more off-base , man . 
  no , i just misunderstood the news . 
  there 's nothing sinister going on . 
  calm down . 
  all good points . 
  fyi , ` cuz ' is kind of a middle school thing . 
  it looks kind of humorous in the middle of an international affairs discussion .
