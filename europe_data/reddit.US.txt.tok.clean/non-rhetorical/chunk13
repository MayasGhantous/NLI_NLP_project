  hey , when you 're $ 20t in debt , $ 100b is a good place to start . 
  the actual words ? 
  i 've only heard it said ironically . 
  still more real than white genocide , though . 
  bill o'reilly has been pushing the war on christmas as long as i can remember . 
  the sentiment that `` happy holidays '' has overtaken `` merry christmas '' for kinda dumb reasons ? 
  common . 
  i believe that . 
  we are surreptitiously on the ground in ukraine right now under the guise of `` trainers . '', 
  we ran logistics and support for france in mali . 
  does the nuclear umbrella not count ? 
  you 're welcome for that , too . 
  of course , just as important as force is threat of force . 
  our guys sat waiting for decades for the soviets to roll westward . 
  but that does n't count , right ? 
  because you need to win the argument . 
  oh please . 
  some european troops were . 
  others were not . 
  i 'm not going to name names , but it 's public information . 
  you can look it up on wikipedia . 
  no sane person would claim that because you were allies once , you have to be allies forever . 
  dude , how many countries sent troops to the middle east just to say they sent them ? 
  with such absurd conditions placed on combat participation that they may as well have been cheerleaders ? 
  just because you sacrificed does n't mean we benefitted . 
  alright ? 
  i 'm sorry your soldiers died in wars they did n't need to be in , but that does n't mean guaranteeing europe 's protection continues to be worth the money and resources we devote to it . 
  what tangible foreign policy goals would you say obama achieved with this deep insight ? 
  what do we get out of our relationship with europe today ? 
  europe gets protection . 
  what do we get ? 
  you 're missing my point : it is easier to be `` willing to do something '' if that something involves getting paid , as opposed to paying . 
  they are willing to receive our money . 
  how noble . 
  damn right . 
  a tip from outside the bubble : wednesday is going to be interesting . 
  samantha power . 
  the un ambassador should n't have the power to unmask . 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  thank you for this insight into the bubble you and your kind live in . 
  i have most definitely not been going on and on about my libertarian views . 
  i 've used the word once in probably the last month . 
  why ca n't you just be honest ? 
  why do you need to make things up ? 
  first israel , now this . 
  you 're playing a rhetorical game because you do n't know the facts on the ground . 
  obama was extremely cold toward israel . 
  did n't visit until his second term . 
  trump made israel his second stop on his first international tour . 
  i personally listened to 10 or 15 interviews with top israeli officials , academics , etc recorded during his trip/the week prior . 
  the excitement is palpable . 
  they 're a little disappointed he 's not moving the embassy to jerusalem immediately , but most seem confident that it will happen eventually . 
  they 've got their # 1 buddy back . 
  europe is not the world , man . 
  ask abe if he wants to distance japan from the us . 
  ask the israelis why they 're saying `` america is back . '', 
  i pray you are right about europe , though . 
  how tantalizing would it be to leave nato ... 
  yeah , yeah , and obama really helped it , right ? 
  i 've heard your opinions before . 
  feel free to cogitate on why . 
  nobody says the words `` white genocide '' in real life , man . 
  israel fucking loves trump , buddy . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  yeah we totally thought that . 
  we did . 
  it was all about these little bastards called cfcs : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chlorofluorocarbon the us banned them in aerosol cans in 1978 and outright in 1996 . 
  here 's a fun fact from the article :  as of 2007 , china , india and south korea were found to account for around 70 % of global cfc production , [ 10 ] south korea later to ban cfc production in 2010 . 
  [ 11 ] india and china , at it again . 
  you just ca n't trust these guys , can you ? 
  in the '80s ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  the hole just recently started re-filling . 
  announcing yourself as `` educated '' is a bad look , btw . 
  let me just remind everyone that in 2008 , people were literally saying that only minorities were going to have a realistic chance of winning presidential elections . 
  cool your jets . 
  oh , a person named griffin . 
  i see . 
  yeah , i hit space after france, 
  do you get that people do n't ** choose ** to `` suffer for absolutely no benefit '' ? 
  do you get that ? 
  people avoid suffering . 
  they avoid it . 
  workers ? 
  at bars ? 
  you ** choose ** which bar to work at . 
  you know full well which ones have which restrictions when taking the job . 
  it 's not a secret . 
  furthermore , that type of job is extremely high availability . 
  you can walk across the street and get a job at a different bar . 
  smoker here . 
  just give me one bar in 10 . 
  that 's all i ask . 
  you can have your choice of the other nine . 
  everybody wins . 
  in us : * rioting * important * so popular * called france, 
  i love everything but the floor , which i hate . 
  yes , actually . 
  all mythical creatures require a special license . 
  oh , is that what netflix did wrong ?
