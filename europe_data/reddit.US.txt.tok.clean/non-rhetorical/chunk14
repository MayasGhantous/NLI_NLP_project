  no , they were just successful and american . 
  if the dominant player were european , this proposal would n't exist . 
  i picked greek because somebody else in the thread picked greek . 
  if you love greek tv shows , good for you . 
   i do n't think the us government would have that much of a problem with this . 
  the eu seems to have it out for big-name american companies . 
  this is just one more example . 
  a certain segment of the european population loves seeing this kind of thing . 
   countries are free to make laws for their own market and other countries are free to respond to them . 
  race to the bottom it is . 
  enjoy your greek tv shows . 
  i 'm not . 
  i 'm telling you that `` america is back '' is n't because he was black . 
  fair ? 
  you guys are ridiculous sometimes . 
  literally the first time i 've ever heard someone suggest that . 
  i think you might be full of it . 
  welcome to our world , bro . 
  i thought that was napoleon . 
  true . 
  yeah , i 'm worried about that . 
  hopefully he 's not an ideologue , and his people can persuade him not to go soft on nk . 
  it just pushes us and japan closer together . 
  * retarded assholes . 
  for the chinese , a remarkable diplomatic gaffe .

  heard a navy guy on the radio say everyone in the navy was smiling ear to ear all day when that came out . 
  see also , from 2016 :  `` to understand the american 's sudden upgraded offensive in the south china sea , '' xinhua [ news agency ] has said , `` it is simply impossible to ignore admiral harris 's ** blood , background ** , political inclination and values . '' http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/us-admiral-harry-harris-has-the-measure-of-china/news-story/3c7113256f931397988303ed36a98b06, 
  yeah , there 's no way . 
  china just yesterday asked us through their ambassador to fire admiral harry harris , commander of the pacific fleet and hardliner on nk . 
  you ca n't tell from his name , but he 's half japanese -- a fact that the chinese media has been obsessed with . 
  uh , no . 
  we 're not firing admiral harris because you think he 's genetically predisposed to have it out for you . 
  lol though . 
  fyi , sweden is in europe . 
  recently , on may 2 , israel 's 69th birthday ( hold the jokes ) , unesco voted 22-10 on a resolution to reject israeli sovereignty over jerusalem . 
  sweden was the lone eu nation to vote in favor . 
  [ here is the swedish government 's official explanation . 
  ] ( http://www.government.se/statements/2017/05/swedens-explanation-of-voting-unesco-resolution-under-item-30-occupied-palestine/ ) votes against : * us * uk * italy * netherlands * lithuania * greece * germany * ukraine * paraguay * togo, 
  it 's 8:32 on the east coast right now , fyi . 
   plus the americans not when we 're within earshot . 
  our go-to comebacks are too annoying/repetitive for you to deal with . 
  i will eat their bbq tho, 
  median , not mean . 
  the median of { 0 , 0 , 5 , 5 , 100000000 } is 5 . 
  the mean is ... whatever . 
  a big number . 
  the language brazil speaks, 
   as i suspected , your question was n't one with the intent to inform yourself , but rather a defiant , irritating act of questioning without effort . 
  ... allllrighty . 
   how about you read 3/4th of it first , instead of 0/0th , hmmm ? 
  i 'm assuming you 're highlighting the good bits . 
  also , you ca n't divide by zero . 
   what would you prefer instead of a `` person 's '' characterization ? 
  a space alien ? 
  `` may did x. '', 
   i ca n't help but cringe when i see people like you attempt to `` lecture '' about this subject matter . 
  experienced though you may be , you also seem a little off kilter . 
  on the one hand , i do n't want to offend , because you 've put in such effort here . 
  on the other , at least 3/4 of these instances are just some person 's characterization , which is to say you 're kind of passing the buck . 
  on snowden 's point , the uk has had strong surveillance laws -- the strongest perhaps of any western nation -- for a long time . 
  it was n't may who started them down that road . 
  by that logic , you would have to label barack obama an authoritarian as well . 
  then again , maybe you would . 
  authoritarian ? 
  regarding what ? 
  it 's sorta-kinda the same thinking that led to the eu being in brussels rather than paris or berlin , if you get my meaning . 
  probably the best proposal i 've heard , ... but i still prefer the status quo . 
  dc is special . 
  if you give the land back , the same thing will happen that did in arlington : big , ugly apartment buildings . 
  i do n't see why we should change the face of the district just to accommodate people who ca n't be bothered to move a few miles to one side if they want congressional representation so badly . 
  impartiality , both between all states and between the north and south . 
  that 's why they picked a spot close to the longitudinal middle , and why they built a new city rather than use an existing one . 
  try as i might , i ca n't genuinely dislike you . 
  i mean the fact that dc 's population is greater than at least one state is the single most commonly cited fact in this discussion , to the point that the debate basically has two sides : those who think population size is a winning point and those who do n't . 
  i do n't -- for the reasons listed among many , many , many others . 
  the list of pros is short , and the list of cons is long . 
  dc has had electoral college votes since the 1960s . 
  goes without saying in this discussion . 
  `` the sun rises in the east . '', 
  yup , it does . 
  `` it literally ca n't get any worse than incels , though . '', 
  * starts raining *, 
  to be completely honest , despite having grown up in the dc area , i 'm not terribly sympathetic to the cause . 
  a ) the district was envisaged as a non-state , deliberately , for reasons i doubt you need me to explain to you . 
  b ) the idea of allocating two senators to 68 square mile plot of land is a political non-starter all by itself . 
  that 's why we 're happy to give dc electoral college votes ( a form of representation , btw , * technically * invalidating the above sign ) , but to upset the numbers game that is the senate by adding two permablue senators is just not going to happen . 
  if dc wants in , they need a red dance partner . 
  maybe ask alaska if they want to split in two . 
  hence their license plates . 
  letting them build those bases gives them increased future ability to enforce claims on that water . 
  it wo n't matter what anyone says is legal . 
  yeah , it 's cruise missile or nothing . 
  it 's not like we can make life difficult for china in other ways . 
  okay , china 's encroachment on the south china sea represents the largest territorial gain since wwii . 
  we did nothing . 
  there 's one for your list . 
  i agree with your general argument , but obama was n't a good president . 
  deep down , even hardcore democrats know that . 
  to call him `` average '' would be generous .
