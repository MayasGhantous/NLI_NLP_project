  maybe that 's significant , maybe it 's not . 
  it 's not for me to say . 
  if you say it 's not , i believe you . 
  okay , that 's one box checked !, 
  what about the others ? 
  one would be uninteresting . 
  two would be curious . 
  why are all three rates significantly closer to 1.0 than they were 10 years ago ? 
  if we fudge the numbers a little , we can even say all three rates are closer to 1.0 than any of the three used to be . 
  ( .80 vs .82 being the exception , but we could find dates that make it true . ), 
  why have the usd , gbp , chf , & eur converged so radically ? 
  | today | 2007 : -- | -- :| -- : swiss franc | 1.00 chf | 1.00 chf us dollar | 1.052965 | 0.820850 euro | 0.903456 | 0.621999 british pound | 0.807145 | 0.418994, 
  seconded . 
  euros do n't know , but every american knows : http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/santa/philadelphia.asp despicable people . 
  swiss exceptionalism !, 
  thank you for the elucidation . 
  how do you mean ? 
  cantons acting as nations , basically ? 
  if bern says yes , i can only live in bern ? 
  yes , yes , i 'm trapped in a media vortex . 
  i am an unthinking blob of hamburger . 
  break what ? 
  the neutrality acts ? 
  we did n't just * want * to break them , we literally repealed them and/or interpreted them in ridiculous ways . 
  `` china and japan are not at war ; was was never declared . '', 
  ah , then we are in perfect agreement . 
  we 've tried that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neutrality_acts_of_1930s did n't work . 
  unless you advocate the us leaving nato ( which would be fine , a defensible position ) , you 're asking to have your cake and eat it too . 
  you ca n't say , `` hey , defend us , but do n't sanction anybody . '', 
  i thought we learned our lesson about appeasing expansionist powers . 
   all it does is forcing the sanctioned nation to find new partners abroad . 
  sanctioning russia is basically saying : `` please trade more with china '' . 
  this is the major difference between sanctioning north korea and sanctioning russia . 
  maybe he means more to the right , like , on a map . 
   what is the reason you 're still doing it ? 
  because the castro regime is a brutal , authoritarian nightmare that kills political dissidents , and we do n't want to aid that regime financially . 
  ( the state owns hotels , etc. ), 
  fwiw , the cuban-american population wholly supports these measures . 
  actually , no . 
  not trying to be a meanie , but technically we 're not . 
   unicornsworshipme pretty dope username , tbh, 
   tourists do n't go there , because most just want to say they 've been to oxford or that they 've seen windsor castle . 
  that 's definitely true . 
  using the above italian 's post as an example , there is a difference between telling people you went to rome vs abruzzo . 
  `` should '' that be a factor ? 
  no , but people are attention whores . 
  speaking from the other side of the aisle , i think this problem might get worse before it gets better . 
  might . 
  but if left-of-center politicians * have to * kowtow to otherkin * to get elected , they 're not going to win many elections . 
  * intentionally silly example, 
   turkish people who are living in europe voted for erdogan 's party akp . 
  however turkish people who are living in arab countries & iran voted for secular republicans now that is interesting . 
  when i lived in dc , my barber was turkish . 
  he and his brother owned the place . 
  these guys had the fanciest fucking shoes , let me tell you . 
  you 're just going to make everyone wait though ? 
  escalators are so slow . 
  relevant meme https://i.redd.it/kzal50r1140z.png, 
  you 're hired !, 
  amusingly , we actually do n't use the word like that . 
  it 's simply a designation of sorts . 
  a high school will have multiple , say , basketball teams . 
  the best one is the varsity team . 
  then jv ( junior varsity . . junior meaning lesser , not grade level ) . 
  sometimes there is also a freshman team . 
  i 've already stopped . 
  do n't induce me to keep going . 
  you never know what stupid thing i might say . 
  7up is independent . 
  if that 's the case , they have an agreement of some kind . 
  i do n't think it 's the insane conclusion you 're making it out to be . 
  it is the nature of a military to be hierarchical . 
  the czech brigade will be underneath a german general in some sense , just as south korean forces are ultimately under an american general . 
  nor do i think it 's a bad thing . 
  the author is correct : it is easier for germany to simply take the lead than to put everything to a vote of 27 countries . 
  if only some people read more than the headline , it would n't be a problem . 
  cough cough . 
  you know the writer does n't even get to pick the headline , right ? 
  that 's the editor 's job . 
  okay . 
  you read more than the headline , and i 'll check before i write . 
  `` some dubious site . '', 
  it 's fucking foreign policy . 
  you think foreign policy is lying about czech and romanian brigades being integrated into the bundeswehr . 
  interesting theory . 
  is only yoke , comrade . 
  and yet ... http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/05/22/germany-is-quietly-building-a-european-army-under-its-command/, 
  weird . 
  ours are minty . 
  if you have the chance , try different brands . 
  there 's more variation among root beers than there is , e.g. , sprite vs sierra mist ( pepsi 's sprite ) , i would say . 
  i literally have no idea what they 're talking about . 
   it 's not something they know about increasingly ` they ' meaning who ? 
  recently , i have been thinking that it depends how many divisions you 're making . 
  if it 's purely east/west , germany is western . 
  if not , central . 
  what do you think ? 
  the only communist i like, 
  oh , is that `` the '' answer ?
