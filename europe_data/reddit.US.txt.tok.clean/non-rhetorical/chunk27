  mostly to make `` moose a leaning '' jokes . 
  16 hours in , and nobody wants to point out why this comparison is lacking . 
  macron was 16 . 
  mrs. macron was a teacher at his school with a husband and kids . 
  she ran out on them for a teenage boy . 
  that 's fucked up . 
  that 's what they had been doing to that point . 
  the tendency of things is to continue the way they are . 
  an object in motion stays in motion . 
  you need a new element for a new outcome . 
  most dictators kinda suck compared to hitler . 
  mussolini 's italy nowhere near the force that hitler 's germany was . 
  north korea ca n't feed itself . 
  the list goes on . 
  if nazism had come to power in a country with a less effective leader , we would n't be talking about it today . 
  hitler was that . 
  he was effective . 
  you need the man , not just the moment . 
  yeah , and people had bows-and-arrows and horses before genghis khan was born . 
  the mere presence of those things does not , by itself , imply the outcome . 
  i really think you need adolf himself . 
  i 'm open to being persuaded , but that 's just what i think right now . 
  edit . 
  forgot we were talking about nazism and not the holocaust . 
  in that case , i 'm less certain . 
  i 'm not buying that for a minute . 
  it is self-evident that whoever first dreamt up \u00c5 said , `` let 's take a and put a little circle over it . '', 
  the same can not be said for e and i. 
  you 'll have to try harder than that !, 
  all i 'm saying is , 1 . 
  give up czech , replace with german . 
  have austria annex you . 
  elect / u/theeatinggames as chancellor . 
  she will let you keep your guns . 
  absorb bavaria . 
  give those hoity toity prussians a run for their fucking money . 
  what . 
  i know right . 
  as an english speaker , i can see the case for accents and umlauts , but beyond that you 're just fucking around . 
  really , you think so ? 
  ww2 is easy to see , but nazism per se ? 
  not just fascism , but nazism happens regardless ? 
  `` propaganda '' is an extra step . 
  you do n't really need it to explain why the nation that leads the current international order would have a big ego . 
  you need it to explain north korea , but not the us . 
   looking at history over the last several decades ah , but we 've always been inward-facing , including before we were a superpower . 
  for years , it was a bit of trivia . 
  `` did you know there 's a socialist in the senate ? '', 
  what ? 
  `` yeah , he 's listed as an independent technically . 
  from vermont . '', 
   bernies big promises were healthcare and minimun wage . 
  all stuff that our center right politics dont want to get rid off . 
  those are promises , not what he would do if he had free reign . 
  why do you think bernie is an independent and not a democrat ? 
  literally , not one sentence in your first para do i agree with , other than the first . 
  the last , i ca n't say , but it 's certainly not a common sentiment that europe is more religious . 
  this is a fine post . 
  i 'm almost surprised at who wrote it , if you do n't mind my saying . 
  most of the paras are airtight , but the american exceptionalism one has a few holes . 
  one , we do n't use the phrase `` god 's own country . '', 
  literally , every use i have come across has been a european describing america 's view of itself . 
  two , we do view ourselves as a city on a hill , especially historically , but the rest of that sentence does not follow from that fact . 
  not in an airtight kind of way . 
  three , propaganda . 
  it is easier to propagandize that which has externally verifiable facts supporting it . 
  why does the nation of south korea exist ? 
  why is taiwan able to govern itself ? 
  no one , not even noam chomsky , seriously suggests placing credit at the feet of other nations . 
  it 's not even a coalition effort like nato . 
  two nations defend the rok : us and the rok . 
  i mean dill , not jem , btw . 
  true fact : the boy in tkam is based on truman capote , author of in cold blood , another high school reading list classic . 
  he and harper lee were childhood friends . 
  listen up , badass . 
  even if your audience has n't heard the slang before , they can still identify it as slang ** if ** all other possible interpretations are nonsensical . 
  killer , right ? 
  `` sick ride , bro . '', 
  =  usage unambiguously different from literal sick or even figurative sick . 
  he ca n't mean your car has cancer . 
  he ca n't mean it has engine problems , because his tone of voice does n't match . 
  it must be slang . 
  ya feel me ? 
  `` healthy ride , bro . '', 
  =  could be slang . 
  could be figurative . 
  we ca n't tell . 
   if that is the case than even in the us there is no `` absolute freedom of speech '' . 
  correct . 
  google `` clear and present danger doctrine '' if you wish to learn about the go-to litmus test . 
  depends what you mean by dangerous . 
  classic case of size of risk vs size of hazard . 
  the size of hazard is far , far greater with electronic ballots . 
  it is faster and easier to alter ones and zeros on a hard drive than checkmarks on paper . 
  i like this . 
  not trying to be difficult , just thinking of edge cases : what if you 're homeless ? 
  or , for whatever reason , do n't have a permanent address ? 
  dare to get real . 
  that 's the kind of tagline i would expect for like a bible camp for teens with drug problems . 
   a badly worded english tagline which does n't even make sense '' ** i am ** sterdam '' comes to mind .
