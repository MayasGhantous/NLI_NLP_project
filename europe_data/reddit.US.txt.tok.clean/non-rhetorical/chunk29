  the whole region has like a handful of universities per state . 
  the south has loads and loads . 
   an ** isolated ** or peaceful place . 
  http://ecpmlangues.u-strasbg.fr/civilization/geography/maps/us%20population%20density,%202010%20570x361.png point to the area on the map that is the most ** isolated . 
  i give up . 
  if you think wyoming is more developed than georgia , we ca n't even have a real conversation about this .

  here 's a video made by some dude .

  take a look . 
   i want to eat real louisiana food . 
  let me give you a tip . 
  travel during fall . 
  go to an lsu tigers college football game . 
  `` i do n't like american football . '', 
  listen to me . 
  at college football games , we do this thing called tailgating . 
  okay ? 
  are you listening ? 
  tailgating . 
  it 's where you bring a truck or an rv with a grill , and you make food and drink alcohol . 
  it 's competitive . 
  people make the best food they are capable of making . 
  they put their own special twists on the recipes to stand out . 
  you will find every type of food louisiana has to offer . 
  you will find multiple versions of each . 
  there is literally no reason for you not to take my advice . 
  you do n't even need to go inside the stadium . 
  you 're just there for the tailgate . 
  is it free ? 
  it can be , but the etiquette is to bring something to trade . 
  beer , liquor , whatever . 
  truthfully , though , if you tell people your story , they 'll invite you into their tailgate for free just out of pride . 
  when you 're ready , come post in / r/cfb about it . 
  some lsu fans will help you out . 
  `` i 'm going to take your advice and there 's going to be like 50 people there . '', 
  that stadium fills to 100,000 every saturday in fall . 
  a significant fraction tailgate . 
  10,000 maybe . 
  if you are really the type of person to fly to louisiana to try the food , you 'd be foolish not to go . 
  lsu is like the mecca of tailgating . 
  it 's between them and ole miss , anyway . 
   and by usa i mean louisana or alaska i ca n't even be mad . 
  both good choices . 
  be sure to tell the canadians it 's * very * different , regardless of the conclusion you come to . 
  have n't seen it . 
  i 'm referring to the fact that the romans paid their soldiers with salt , hence the word salary . 
  i will look at your link , though , because i 'm interested to see what it 's about . 
   edit precisely . 
  the rathaus would be just as beautiful in the middle of a forest . 
  i want that city feel . 
  i clicked on `` vienna panorama '' at the top , though , and i think i 'm getting some of it . 
  i tried googling * hallstatt etymology * myself . 
  google provided this very useful answer :  mid 19th century : the name of a village in austria , site of a burial ground of this period . 
  so austria was rich in roman times , too . 
  \\ # 1 reason europeans are less prudish than americans , imo : http://www.sehnsuchtdeutschland.com/upload/images/imagegallery/37_1_imperia_konstanz_tourismus-marketing_gmbh_baden-wuerttemberg_achim_mende_567.jpg, 
  okay , portugal is impressive . 
  you know , i often do n't like the crazy different colors european houses sometimes have ( pastel yellow/red/pink / etc ) , but i think this is gorgeous . 
  i know you linked to `` rovinj streets '' for a reason , but look at that : http://www.vololuxury.com/images/static/20140314165418000000-main.jpg wow . 
  you 're telling me two of these three towns have ` salt ' in the name ? 
  my point is only to avoid image searches that will inevitably be filled with the eiffel tower , arc d'triumph , louvre , etc. 
  i want my eyes to be awash with beautiful images i * have n't * seen before . 
  ( so far , the thread is succeeding ! ), 
  i love the black roofs in hallstadt , btw . 
  they really set off the other colors nicely . 
  that elephant is fucking sick . 
   tbm = isch found you , you little rascal . 
   the american south is viewed by the north as poorer , far less developped , more backwards , lower average education , higher teen pregnancies , more crime , more prisoners , more violence , more wellfare receipients etc i would only agree with about half of that . 
  am northerner . 
   it 's the backwater of the country the backwater of the country is the mountain time zone ( minus denver , yada yada ) . 
  scroll through this google image search for me : https://www.google.com/search?q=savannah+georgia&amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;prmd=minv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiez8rsy9btahxi5omkhxvzaoeq_auicigc&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=511, 
  fish have short attention spans . 
  it 's auschwitz for fishes . 
  the last place a fish wants to be . 
  i was like 12 . 
  let 's not look too deeply at this one . 
  my brother really wanted a fish tank , and he got one , and he went through like 30 fish before our parents shut it down . 
  what if you nicknamed your brother 's fish tank `` ausfisch '' because his fish kept dying ? 
  what level ? 
  what exactly went wrong ? 
  the only item i am aware of is that lots of state assets surreptitiously made their way into private hands and were subsequently sold for billions . 
  wow , that 's quite a change . 
  `` this product was not made over international waters or in outer space . '', 
  yeah , it 's not terribly common here either . 
  now that i think of it , there are two kinds : the blatant and the hidden . 
  blatant meaning they are advertising that fact . 
  they want you to know . 
  blatant labels will say usa or sometimes germany . 
  hidden ones will say china , taiwan , or some random pacific rim country i could n't point to on a map . 
  record the whole time . 
  one point in your favor on that front is your swedish name . 
  ( of course you 've thought of this , but just to be explicit for others reading this thread . ), 
  yes , one out of every 50,000 times someone uses that word , they spell it like that . 
  well , it 's definitely not asia or africa . 
  beyond that , it depends on how you define things . 
  does australia 's cooperation with itself count toward the total ? 
  is russia a part of europe ?
