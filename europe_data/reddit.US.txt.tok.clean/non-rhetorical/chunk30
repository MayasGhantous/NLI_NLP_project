  is mexico a figment of our imaginations ? 
  no , it does n't sound familiar . 
  the jews were a ) an ethnic group , and b ) german citizens . 
  also , wittingly or not , you 're conflating illegal immigrants with all immigrants . 
  furthermore , you may or may not be aware , that we have problems a ) prosecuting and b ) punishing illegal immigrants ( for general crimes , not just immigration crimes ) . 
  http://nypost.com/2016/03/06/why-new-york-refuses-to-give-up-criminals-for-deportation/ i doubt either of those were the case with the jews in germany , but do n't let that get in the way of your moralizing . 
  really ? 
  just like that , it 's all over ? 
  jealous ? 
  please . 
  `` they finally get it . 
  \\  . \\  < . < < . < < . < o.o < . <, 
  i agree , but with a caveat : currency . 
  it is not the same for the uk to leave as it is for france , because the uk kept the pound . 
  that would be a central point of debate , if real debate were to arise . 
  yep . 
  did i say concept , or did i say term ? 
  i think you just do n't like being corrected . 
  it 's not a 21st century term . 
  our guy invented it . 
  we 'll say what it means . 
  you 're playing semantics with the clergy thing . 
  you admit influence . 
  you must also admit the state gave them much of their money . 
  they get money from the state , and they influence the state , but they 're apolitical ? 
  you 're unbelievable . 
  yeah , we can , because that 's * what the phrase means . 
  * please . 
   political expression we only use in denmark ? 
  of the two choices , that one, 
  this is a common misunderstanding among euros . 
  in the 1700s , what they meant by separation was not that saying `` god '' would be disallowed . 
  it was that the clergy would not be a political class as they had been in europe for the last thousand years . 
  because thomas jefferson did n't invent the phrase `` freedom of speech . '', 
  ruby , backend . 
  i could use something new , though . 
  the thing is , a ) i fundamentally dislike everything about javascript , which kills the frontend for me . 
  b ) i do n't want to develop apps . 
  the pay for app devs is great , though , so i might just bite the bullet . 
  my man . 
  a few scattered thoughts --  but they are . 
  or else thousands of citizens from several countries in the middle east would not be allowed to enter the usa . 
  technically , that would have been about over by now . 
  it was a 90-day travel ban , issued within the first week or so , and i think we just passed 100 days . 
  i 'm pointing this out to be humorous more than anything . 
  -- i wonder how many intelligence agencies around the world are subject to congressional/parliamentary oversight the way the cia is . 
  -- from hitler to erdogan ( not `` comparing '' ) , we 've seen time and again that checks and balances are not just worth the piece of paper they are written on . 
  each pursued a route to granting himself dictatorial powers within the pre-existing legal framework . 
  in erdogan 's case , the referendum . 
  in hitler 's case , the `` enabling act . '', 
   first year ( or two ? ), 
  variable . 
  zero to two . 
   trade school is for welding , carpenting , bricklayer , mechanic etc. 
  stuff like ** it support ** , veterinarian , ** sysadmin ** , chef , hairdresser etc. 
  also go here . 
  yeah , that 's one thing i was wondering about . 
  as a software dev myself , i think many tech jobs do not require a university degree the way mechanical engineering does . 
  lots of us have one anyway , but still . 
   the muslim girls in my school just never wore anything ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  this may be a simple translation error . 
  in english , `` in public '' means on the street , in a restaurant , etc. , but the law afaik refers to * public buildings * , meaning governmental buildings ( courthouses , etc ) . 
  rafa seems to know more about it , though . 
  my explanation assumes you get your information from english sources , of course . 
  being open to learning about china does n't foster peaceful relations . 
  you would need to * actually * learn about them . 
  i ca n't mean simple , because i just called them thoughtful . 
  in english , to call a * person * simple is to call him stupid . 
  i mean the germans color inside the lines . 
  how about that ? 
   maybe if every human being was curious about other cultures here is my proxy for cultural curiosity . 
  can you name one novelist from that country ? 
  can anyone reading this name one ? 
  likely not . 
  tsk , tsk , isolating yourself from china . 
  totally . 
  how many chinese novelists can you name ? 
  1 . who knew czechs liked guns so much ? 
  the we/ee divide is real and here to stay . 
  the french seem curiously different , personality-wise , than the rest of we . 
  the dutch are perhaps the friendliest . 
  germans are thoughtful but plain . 
  ee representation is repressed due to political differences . 
  you guys are way more into the eu than americans are generally aware of . 
  like , by a lot . 
  if you approached a man on the street and said , `` the eu has prevented war for 70 years , '' he would be like , '' ... is n't ... but is n't that a trade thing ? '', 
  my problem with this perspective , and the broader pacifist critique of `` big stick '' foreign policy , is that it works ** if and only if ** the other guy does it too . 
  are you willing to bet on that ? 
  i 'm not . 
  gim me my stick back . 
  from my perspective , this thread is pretty light on the anti-americanism . 
  i can deal with people saying americans are not the coolest . 
  if i were to respond to op , i would simply say that such polls often reflect a `` big name '' bias . 
  the article also says brazilians were voted the coolest latin americans . 
  is that really true ? 
  maybe . 
  or maybe you need to be a big country to place high in the rankings . 
  ehhhh . 
  what would you call it , then ? 
  i assume you agree there is something producing the passion / u/junkeregge refers to .
