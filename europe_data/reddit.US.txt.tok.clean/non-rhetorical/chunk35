  literally , the beginning of the document is , `` we the people , in order to form a more perfect union , ... '', 
  i did n't vote . 
  the mathematical side of my brain is like , `` it does n't matter . 
  you cast a tie-breaking vote in a system that does n't produce ties . '', 
  * that 's * pragmatism . 
   -- hillary `` ca n't we just drone this guy ? '', 
  clinton ? 
  it 's not like everybody just disagreed with her but respected her as a person . 
  also , all things considered , i think he 's doing okay . 
  i like what i 've seen from mattis , tillerson , and gorsuch . 
  i like that we 're not rolling over to china in the south china sea anymore , as was the policy under the previous admin . 
  i liked hearing tillerson say our `` strategic patience '' with nk is at an end . 
  is everything going smoothly ? 
  far from it , but that 's what i expected . 
  -- you have to get past the headlines . 
  if i have n't invalidated myself in the eyes of / r/askeurope with my political opinions already , i will probably do so by complaining about the media . 
  nonetheless , this is a very weird time . 
  i ca n't emphasize that enough . 
  the prestige media has gone bonkers . 
  even when gwb 's approval rating was hovering around 13 % , they still gave him a fair hearing . 
  they do n't do that with trump . 
  during the campaign , a majority of clinton supporters polled agreed that the media was biased in her favor . 
  you never see that here . 
  people always , always , always say the media is against them . 
  presumably by returning over a week later with a weak comeback . 
  from 3,000 miles away , that stuff seems like all talk , esp . 
  people just like pushing the chess pieces around the board . 
  what about a gay leprechaun who loves playing mario kart ? 
  dunno if true , but some say indigo was added to the english version to make the sequence pronounceable : roy g. biv . 
  his 72 virgins , of course . 
  hyuck hyuck hyuck . 
  is unfair joke , comrades . 
  i apology . 
  arguably the answer is more a reflection of the speaker 's values . 
  when in rome . 
  do they still like the austrians in austria ? 
  what racist things does your dad actually do/say ? 
  yeah , my brother was just being an 11-year-old . 
  i think man is a more complex animal than you 're making him out to be . 
  if race theory were the end-all , be-all , trump would not have outperformed romney with latinos . 
  perhaps the poles believe the ukrainians will return home after the war and mena refugees will not . 
  i suppose you could call that a racist belief , but whatever . 
  my point is , when people do n't have a lot , they are risk-averse . 
  that 's biological . 
  it 's in your bones . 
  my mom took my little brother to see that . 
  he was like 11 . 
  they come back , and he 's like , `` ugh . 
  more like * sex actually . 
  in the us , more economically vulnerable populations are more likely to be anti-immigration . 
  that `` toxic mindset '' could simply be rational self-interest , no ? 
  what am i missing ? 
  mr. / u/ru4reelzbroski has been heavily downvoted , even for this sub , but i will defend him on one point : to cry 10 times in a row is a little much . 
  no matter how tragic the event , the idea that you ca n't even think about it without being moved to tears is ... fake . 
  i 'm sorry , but it is . 
  once , twice , three times , fine . 
  come on . 
  oh , now i get it . 
  what if you 're not a simple middleman , buying one thing and reselling it ? 
  say i 'm a sandwich shop . 
  i buy bread , meat , cheese , etc. , but i do n't sell them . 
  i sell sandwiches . 
  then what ? 
  yeah , we do that here , too . 
  if i buy a $ 0.99 bag of chips , i pay $ 1.06 . 
  the store takes that $ 0.07 and gives it to the gubmint . 
  what they do n't do is ask how much they paid frito-lay for my bag of cheetos . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
  do you see what i mean ? 
  in my experience , they get pissy about `` soccer , '' but other than that , they 'll leave you alone . 
  nobody has a 24 % sales tax !, 
  here that 's $ 1.06 . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61r410/why_is_there_no_global_european_amazoneu_shop/dfgxkkf/?context=3 we do n't do that . 
  okay , but all this about calculating the difference between what you buy and what you sell , we do n't have . 
  the explanation i 'm getting in / r/europe does n't sound like sales tax to me . 
  sounds more complicated . 
  we just have sales tax , which each state does differently . 
  anywhere from 0 to upper single digit percent . 
  that 's it . 
  thank you !, 
  do you perceive anything wrong with that ? 
  the danish chap seemed to think , perhaps more on ideological than legal grounds , that this was wrong somehow . 
  yeah , that 's not the significant part of the story , though . 
  the significant part is that the heating guy refused to install the same unit from poland . 
  i believe that . 
  what i 'm not sure about is whether `` everything '' is that way . 
  i recall a poster on here from , say , ned who needed to buy a new appliance of some kind , maybe a heating unit . 
  he found one for cheap in poland , but the heating guy said , `` no , no , we have to buy it here . '', 
  same exact unit . 
  the poster complained that this was illegal , buy he ultimately went along with it . 
  like , i do n't know , hence the post . 
  you 're talking to someone who just learned what vat is 3 minutes ago . 
  slow down . 
  i mean there seem to be complexities of doing business which do not exist in other single markets . 
   human blockade now that 's a fucking name !, 
  * keeps reading * oh , it 's literal . 
  neither is race relations , padre . 
  you see news stories . 
  good for you . 
  you have no context to place them in .
