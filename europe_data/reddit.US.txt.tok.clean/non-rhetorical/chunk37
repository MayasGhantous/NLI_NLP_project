  i think the racism question is irrelevant . 
  the fact is , as another poster pointed out , this is bad customer service . 
  vote with your wallet and end it there . 
  seriously , if you are letting this consume hours of your time , it has already lived too long . 
  do n't let that toxicity into your life . 
  just pick another vape . 
  eh , i can see what he means . 
  `` nationalism '' is not a good option . 
  well that sucks . 
  is it really ** everything ** ? 
  what about housing ? 
  gas ? 
  a meal at an okay restaurant ? 
  fwiw , our coke has high fructose corn syrup , but mexico 's has cane sugar . 
  recently , they have started selling versions of coke/pepsi/etc . 
  with cane sugar . 
  i tried the mountain dew , but i did n't like it . 
  maybe i should go back and try the coke . 
  i loved germany 's coke when i was there . 
  like , can christoph waltz stand around in the center of vienna eight weeks before the election screaming , `` if we do n't elect turtle , we 're all fucked !, 
  turtle , please !, 
  please , god , save us !, 
  send us turtle ! '', 
   i think even the large parties are suspicious of each other aha , now i can see it . 
  this is a recurring problem in both directions . 
  people coming from a two-party system background ca n't see the `` game theory '' in the proportional system , and [ vice versa ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/60jg3m/europeans_of_reddit_what_would_you_do_to_improve/dfad2ar/?context=3 ) . 
  ( the linked example is about more than just the two-party system , in that it 's also about the ec , but you get my point . ), 
  simply put , i was thinking , `` well , if you 're big , you should n't want rules that favor the littles . '', 
  but it 's more complex than that . 
  i was n't seeing the game theory . 
  question on the definition of campaigning : you 've addressed the * who * , but i think you left out the * what . 
  * what constitutes campaigning ? 
  -- unsolicited english tip : the format of the previous question -- `` what constitutes x ? '', 
  -- is hyper-useful in legal discussions , or anything where you 're playing a definitional game . 
  * `` what is life ? '', 
  -- sounds philosophical/religious . 
  * `` what does it mean to live ? '', 
  -- i do n't want to attend your seminar . 
  * `` what constitutes life ? '', 
  we 're talking about , say , whether viruses count as living organisms . 
  they contain dna , after all !, 
  they move around and shit . 
  are we really going to have two categories , one containing lions and tigers and fungi , and the other containing rocks and space dust and cell phones , and viruses are going to be in category two ? 
  why !, 
   viruses are not considered `` alive '' because they lack many of the properties that scientists associate with living organisms . 
  primarily , they lack the ability to reproduce without the aid of a host cell , and do n't use the typical cell - division approach to replication that 's bullshit , google !, 
  i do n't know what i 'm talking about . 
  i 'm not a biologist . 
  but you get the point . 
  `` what constitutes x ? '', 
  is a pointed , useful question . 
  can you give an example ? 
  it 's easy to see the logic , but i ca n't envision it . 
   there are 500 million opinions on this one i suppose . 
  really ? 
  so far there seems like one : `` so long as they integrate , as defined by adopting the language and culture . '', 
  so much uniformity leads me to think that there is something unspoken going on here , but i do n't know what . 
   worse than trudeau . 
  at ... at what ? 
  taking selfies ? 
   also , the beauty of this approach lies in the fact that not every state has to pass this legislation . 
  the more do pass it , the more democratic your political system becomes . 
  i think you ( and mr. dawkins ) might be missing game-theoretic aspect to this , coming from the outside . 
  let 's spell this out using california as an example . 
  candidate | % of state vote | 2016 ec votes | proportionalized ec votes : -- | -- :| -- :| -- :| hillary clinton | 61.73 % | 55 | 34 donald trump | 31.62 % | 0 | 18 gary johnson | 3.37 % | 0 | 2 jill stein | 1.96 % | 0 | 1 1 . 
  do you think the people 's republic of california has any intention of turning this hypothetical into a reality ? 
  they just stole 21 ec votes away from their preferred candidate -- almost as many as the state of fl awards all by itself ( 25 ) -- and gave 18 to the gop candidate . 
  that 's a 39-point swing . 
  instead of winning 304 to 227 , trump now wins 322 to 206 . 
  did our political system just become `` more democratic '' like you said it would ? 
  the popular vote loser now wins by even more . 
  what kinds of fliers ? 
  interesting . 
  this may seem like a silly question , but why would a larger party want to level the playing field ? 
  yeah , it 's more arvina i 'm disappointed in here . 
  `` leading figure . '', 
  oh my god . 
  if i were ever going to post something on / r/shiteuropeanssay , this would be the time . 
  of course , it 's an understandable mistake , because it sounds like a name , but to go beyond and start talking about the man 's legislative career is just humorous . 
  what did you look up ? 
  there is no man named jim crow !, 
  lol , no . 
  jim crow was not the name of a real , live person . 
  it 's an understandable mistake , but no . 
  false . 
  it 's on youtube if you want to give it a shot : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxyceftcc5w i wo n't tell you it 's a `` blast , '' but i found it entertaining . 
  i do n't recall the movie touching on that topic , but i have a much weaker memory for subtitled movies , so i could easily be wrong . 
  iirc , they select a few events out of his career rather than attempting a holistic timeline . 
  you might be right . 
  i would say this , though : i do not now , nor have i ever , gotten the impression that euros really , truly grasp the specific nature of american exceptionalism . 
  i think they see a parallelism of words and translate that to a parallelism of ideas , which is a mistake . 
  that said , i do agree that americans lack a sense of the truly long-term and therefore of the cyclical nature of history . 
  we see an upward exponential curve and think it 's going to keep going up . 
  when the chinese see an upward exponential curve , they think it 's going to come back down . 
  they 've done studies on this . 
  1st amendment , freedom of speech/expression . 
  fundamentally , to campaign for office is to simply say , `` i am or plan to be a candidate for this office . 
  please vote for me . '', 
  a law which prohibits that is a law which puts arbitrary constraints on freedom of expression . 
  we do have a history of limiting free speech , but the rule we usually go by is `` clear and present danger . '',
