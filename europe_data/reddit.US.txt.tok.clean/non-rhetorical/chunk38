  yelling fire in a crowded movie theatre is the famous example . 
  yelling fire causes a stampede , and people get hurt . 
  the annoyances of a long campaign cycle fall well short of the `` clear and present danger '' standard . 
  pretend i 'm russian . 
  i heard about a russian proverb the other day : * \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043a \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 , \u0434\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0442 * =  the russians are slow to mount ... but ride fast . 
  that 's pretty ... sexy .

  my guesses :  when you 're twisting the cat 's neck make sure you 've put a sock in it 's mouth . 
  `` if you 're going to use/exploit someone ( esp . 
  illegally ) , make sure they ca n't hurt you/cry for help . '', 
   it 's not just women who get wet . 
   if the bath is cold you could always piss in it . 
  a thing to say in response to complaints . 
   you could tell the queen but she 'd only behead you . 
  `` do n't be overly honest with your superiors . '', 
  edit . 
  you thought this was a simple question with a simple answer . 
  five-paragraph response !, 
  screw your assumptions !, 
  when i was in high school , i bought myself a tv and a used ps2 for my room , so i could watch movies whenever i wanted . 
  i love movies . 
  anyway , this was circa 2005 , when you still had to actually buy physical dvds to watch movies . 
  i had two , and i watched them over and over . 
  gladiator and fight club . 
  i probably watched gladiator 30 times , usually falling asleep halfway through , throughout my sophomore year of high school . 
  i think there are two mentions ... 1 . 
  ** guy with scar on his face : ** m'lady !, 
  m'lady !, 
  i served your father at vindobona -- and i serve the general maximus . 
  i serve him still ... 2 . 
  before they fight as the `` barbarian horde '' against the archers in the chariots , they 're standing in the middle of the arena . 
  maximus says , `` anyone ever been in the army ? '', 
  an unseen ( off-screen ? ), 
  character replies , `` i served with you at vindobona . '', 
  maximus nods and says , `` you can help me . '', 
  i always found the second one interesting , because you have the basis for an interesting relationship there . 
  a general and a common soldier who served under him , but did not know him personally , are re-united as slaves fighting as gladiators . 
  maximus so does n't know who this man is , that he never recognizes his face even though they are owned by the same man , and have presumably lived and trained together for weeks or months . 
  the common soldier recognizes maximus , but he never says anything to him . 
  we are told ( and in the first case , above , shown ) that his soldiers are extremely loyal to him . 
  it 's even a plot point : that 's how they expect to take the city . 
  if they can get maximus outside the city gates , if his army sees his face , they will rebel against the new generals appointed by commodus . 
  so why does n't he say anything ? 
  i think the most reasonable explanation is that it 's a show of extreme deference . 
  such is his respect for maximus that he simply does n't bother him , no matter how much he wants to . 
  it would have been extremely interesting to explore that connection , though . 
  i wonder why they chose not to . 
  vindobona from gladiator !, 
  now i know ... 
  pm me the pictures . 
  i will pretend to live in your house . 
  you 're supposed to click the gif !, 
  this is my reaction to learning a new word , and then putting it in context of your last paragraph . 
  now that is a pretty big one . 
  how large do you think the state would have been ? 
  what are we talking about ? 
  as a total aside , i love bismarck . 
  churchill has a lot of `` hardy har '' quotes . 
  bismarck has a lot of `` fockin ' right '' quotes . 
  `` the great questions of the day ... '' such a fuck-you . 
  i did n't know the context of that speech ( an uncooperative parliament ) until i watched bismarck ( 1940 ) . 
  obviously , it 's a german film being made in 1940 about a german hero . 
  we can all guess the motives behind it . 
  still , i do n't think it was a propaganda piece in the sense of rewriting history or fudging the truth -- not more than any other movie about a historical figure . 
  the columbus thing is really interesting . 
  on examination , it seems blindingly obvious , but i had never considered it before . 
  you need someone to actually fund the voyage . 
  what were the actual , real-world prospects of that ? 
  apparently , not good . 
   wroth  old english wra\u00f0 `` angry '' ( literally `` tormented , twisted '' ) , from proto-germanic * wraithaz ( cf. 
  old frisian wreth `` evil , '' old saxon wred , middle dutch wret , dutch wreed `` cruel , '' old high german reid , old norse rei\u00f0r `` angry , offended '' ) , from pie * wreit - `` to turn '' ( see wreath ) . 
  i 'm really not , despite being non-religious myself . 
  there is a certain crowd of atheists who seem to believe that their atheism makes them ipso facto more intelligent than all or virtually all religious people . 
  they are wrong . 
  it is vicious . 
  47 % of adult population of inner-city detroit are functionally illiterate , meaning they ca n't read or write beyond very simple sentences ( words on signs , for example ) . 
  confusingly , half of that 47 % have a high school diploma .

  i bet you know who tariq nasheed is . 
  `` hidden colors . '', 
  i watched hidden colors . 
  there 's this one guy on there talking about how he knows his second-grade teacher , a white lady , was racist because the other kids could read but he could n't . 
  i wanted to shake the guy . 
  `` teachers do n't teach kids to read !, 
  parents do ! '', 
  a single person ca n't teach a classroom full of kids to read . 
  there are n't enough hours in the day . 
  his teacher did n't fail him . 
  his parents did . 
  i 'd like to ask that guy , though , what do you want us to do ? 
  do you want us to elect your school board for you ? 
  what do you want ? 
  he 's on hidden colors talking about , `` how can you expect us to succeed when you do n't give us the education . '', 
  no , no , no . 
  that 's high-level , floaty , conceptual junk . 
  what do you want ? 
  give me a policy proposal . 
  10,000 dissertations have been written on why inner-city schools are the way they are .
