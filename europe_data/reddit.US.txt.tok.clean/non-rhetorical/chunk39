  well , they 're still that way . 
  guess those dissertations ai n't doing a whole lot . 
  what 's funny to me is , there are actually tons of people trying to create change in this area . 
  who are they ? 
  they 're the people starting charter schools . 
  ironically , the left hates these people . 
  they hate school choice . 
  they think it 's evil . 
  a lot of people in inner cities are dying to send their kids to those charter schools . 
  they go to those lotteries ( which is a horridly dystopian way of selecting students , imo ) , and they get on their knees and pray for their kid 's number to get called . 
  the left sees this and says , `` no . 
  we need to keep throwing money at the traditional public schools . 
  maybe when they have twice the funding the suburbs do , they wo n't be a total shit show . '', 
  i want to shake them , too . 
  i can see where you 're coming from , schwer . 
  i just think the argument is a little too simple . 
  a little too `` one to one . '', 
  in all that has ever been written condemning the nazis , the word * spirit * probably has 1/1 ,00 th as many mentions as the word * race * . 
  this is not by accident . 
   america is not any different than any other country . 
  you must remember that . 
  not in any way , not better or worse . 
  why did you move from poland to germany ? 
  because poland is different from germany . 
  i ca n't elaborate beyond that fact , but that fact by itself can be taken a priori otherwise you would have stayed where you were . 
  ----- euros compare their mindset with the american mindset , and they draw these grand , sweeping , even self-congratulatory conclusions . 
  `` we do n't fly flags here , because nationalism is bad . 
  we learned that nationalism is bad because of wwii . '', 
  that 's one possibility . 
  really , it could be true . 
  another thing that could be true is that you do n't fly flags because a higher percentage of people encountering those flags do n't identify with them . 
  belgians who live in belgium but work in france do n't desire to see the french tricolor all the time , and the french accommodate that , consciously or subconsciously , deliberately or by accident . 
  if you have two pubs , one draped with french flags and one with no flags , which one is going to draw more belgian patrons ? 
  now compound that effect across all businesses , etc. 
  dude , by setting a period at all , you are making it illegal before that period . 
  because campaigning is largely speaking , ergo the proposal is to make it illegal to speak certain things . 
  dunno what 's so hard about that . 
  i 'm struggling to put this into sentence form . 
  despite the way our news reports on it , the supreme court is not what we call `` big p political . '', 
  there are not four democrats and four republicans on the court -- there are four d appointees and four r appointees . 
  when someone calls antonin scalia a conservative justice , the word * conservative * is being used in a slightly different way than when we call an actual politician conservative . 
  in the context of law , it refers to his theoretical outlook on how judges should read and interpret the law . 
  confusingly , conservatives often appoint conservatives , and liberals , liberals . 
  nonetheless , the word does not refer to scalia 's personal politics . 
  the overriding reason people keep track of the split is abortion . 
  dem and repub presidents always secure the pro-choice/pro-life vote by promising to appoint justices who agree/disagree with roe v wade * from a legal perspective . 
  * supposedly , if r appointees ever regain the advantage , we can expect roe to be overturned , though some are skeptical that that will actually happen . 
  moreover , the sc is simply not a political body . 
  ( in fact , justices receive lifetime appointments so that they will be as unaffected by politics as possible when making their decisions . ), 
  to speak of the sc representing or not representing the populace , politically , is simply wrongheaded . 
  a verdict is not a political position . 
  the promise of justice is not subject to democracy . 
   i really do n't think it 's constitutional to treat corporations like they 're people . 
  which part of the constitution would you cite in coming to that conclusion ? 
  a few states have actually adopted commissions or even algorithms to combat the threat of gerrymandering . 
  you would have to do it at the state level , though . 
  the feds have the final say on most things ( federal preemption ) , but that sort of thing is simply beyond their reach without an amendment . 
  exactly . 
  they also do n't have incentive to get rid of primaries . 
  among other , more complex reasons , it 's simply months and months of free publicity . 
  richard dawkins should stick to science and belittling religious people . 
  if you accept the political reality that amending the constitution to abolish the ec is nigh impossible , you should similarly able to accept the political reality that ( most ) states do n't want to do that either . 
  arizona even has a law that will put electors in prison if they do n't give their electoral votes to the candidate who won the state . 
  do you really believe that would be constitutional ? 
  there 's a long tradition of money = expression . 
  in all likelihood , items 1 and 2 would get blocked on freedom of expression . 
  ( this is a common theme with suggestions so far . ), 
   so that the battle is more fair for small candidates . 
  my honest conjecture is that it would n't matter . 
  one of our most popular presidents of all time , teddy roosevelt , came out of retirement to run for president as a third-party candidate and got his ass kicked ( still came in 2nd , though ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election,_1912 also , i ca n't help but throw this in : https://i.stack.imgur.com/brabq.png had a normal politician won with that kind of spending deficit , this election would 've been hailed as a fresh breath of democracy . 
  lol . 
   massively reduce the length of election campaigns . 
  i do n't see how you could do that within the constraints of the us constitution . 
  you 'd get blocked on freedom of expression . 
  you replied to the wrong comment , fyi . 
  also , are you not a white male ? 
  you have a male writing style . 
   in [ ... ] supreme court there is at least some proportional representation http://i.imgur.com/gkbdyts.jpg, 
  kfc has ice cream ? 
  weird . 
  honestly , i took his comments first and foremost as a statement about poles ' attitudes toward africans . 
  ( not saying i 'm right , just saying that 's how i took it . ), 
  if africans have a very bad reputation , and you look african , then the fact that you are not comes as a welcome surprise to the other party . 
  while we 're on the topic , though , i 'll tell you a thought i had the other day . 
  what is america ? 
  americans say it 's not any one thing -- it 's diverse -- it 's different in different places . 
  you 've heard it all before . 
  the common european retort is that europe is , in fact , more diverse , or that segregation ! = diversity , as referenced in the sas header . 
  here is the truth . 
  ^ ^ are ^ ^ you ^ ^ listening ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ america ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ whatever ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ want ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ be . 
  the raw materials of whatever life you want to lead can be found there . 
  that does n't mean it 's nicer . 
  that does n't mean it 's better for the average person . 
  that does n't mean our average test scores are going to be high . 
  if we wanted high test scores , we would first have to care how the inner city scores on tests , which we have no intention of doing . 
  we gave up a long time ago . 
  why ? 
  because ultimately it 's their problem .
