   differences from what ? 
  whatever you want to talk about , really . 
  obviously , the complete differences between polish and english regarding comma usage may be a little more extensive than you feel like detailing , but if you want to talk about it , i 'm happy to read it . 
  let me say , by the way , that comma usage is widely misunderstood in english . 
  native speakers make more grammatical mistakes with commas than perhaps anything else . 
  for example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comma_splice, 
  ha , fair enough . 
  someone else will have to invent a better hypothetical than mine to truly test you . 
  it 's more complex than a specific date , of course . 
  sometimes we americans view great britain as `` us before us , '' but sometimes we do n't . 
  let me give you a hypothetical , just to tease this out a little bit . 
  you live in england . 
  you 're taking history courses at a university . 
  all of the students are english except for yourself and a proud italian , who is a good friend of yours . 
  the italian has a habit of commenting on the greatness of rome , yada yada , throughout the class , as rome grows in power and does great things . 
  that 's just his personality . 
  today in history class , however , the professor is covering the sacking of rome by germanic tribes from the north . 
  q : do you throw a playful wink in your friend 's direction , yes or no ? 
  technically either works , thank you very much . 
  so it does !, 
  this is one of my problem words , thanks to lake erie . 
  i always say to myself , `` you spell it the way the lake is not spelled . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bog_body here is tollund man , from 4th century bc : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/tollundmannen.jpg, 
  my thought is that europe is sort of like the galapagos islands , but for languages instead of finches . 
  you might accuse me of underestimating the linguistic diversity of what americans call east asia ( china , japan , korea ) , but i really do n't see how it could compare to europe . 
  especially for the japanese . 
  japan is famous for cutting itself off from the outside world . 
  did you know , for example , that chinese and korean are `` tonal '' languages , whereas japanese is not ? 
  i am a layman , but that suggests to me they have been linguistically isolated for a long , long time . 
  i picked that word with this problem in mind !, 
  yet still , i failed . 
  oh , i meant only to say , `` the germans have a strong academic tradition in this area . 
  for that reason , universities might have more to offer . '', 
  i hear , for example , that the japanese have approximately zero interest in linguistics . 
  someone said that if you take a language class in japan and ask about a word 's etymology , they will give you a blank stare . 
  nobody cares about that stuff . 
  it 's simply not of interest . 
  am i crazy , or are your paragraphs slightly closer together ? 
  are you doing something to produce that effect ? 
  well you are right , to say ` hop on a bomb ! ', 
  would be quite comical . 
  now these are quality !, 
  i have to ask , where does the pepper grow ? 
  oh , i was n't trying to correct you . 
  it was a genuine question . 
  perhaps ` h\u00fcpfen ' would mean something slightly different . 
  from what i hear , the germans really dominated linguistics in the early goings , so i am not surprised . 
  the name franz bopp comes to mind , but he is only one of several titans as i understand it . 
   h\u00fcpfen is a nicer / more `` childish '' way to say jump in german kind of like ` hop ' ? 
  there is a children 's game called [ hopscotch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hopscotch ) , for example . 
  we also say bunnies ` hop ' , but humans generally do not ` hop ' unless they are imitating a bunny . 
  very interesting . 
  sometimes i wish i had studied linguistics . 
  there is just so much content there , so much to learn . 
  in english , ` to cut oneself * off * ' means something different from ` to cut oneself . ', 
  i knew the easterners would have interesting ones . 
  what does it mean to jump down ? 
  jump down where ? 
  into hell ? 
  into a grave ? 
  interessant . 
  how might you use `` scher ' dich '' in another context ? 
  is it like `` ex-communicate yourself '' ? 
  i lol 'd irl . 
   suicideplan should i take the lack of a space here to mean ` selbstmordplan ' is a word in german ? 
  you know what ? 
  why do n't you just go play in traffic ? 
  ( there 's a new-age one for you . 
  never used it , personally . ), 
  aha , we use rotting , too , but i had n't thought of it . 
  `` rot in hell ! '', 
  there must be an element of death !, 
  can you think of another one besides ` geh sterben ' ? 
  do n't you need arms to have elbows ? 
  or are they saying because it bends the other way , it 's an elbow , not a knee or whatever ? 
  i am disappoint . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  how big is aftenposten in norway ? 
  i 've got a bad feeling about this . 
  we expanded nato too far east . 
  those who want d\u00e9tente , do they think trump can deliver , or do they think his political position is too weak ? 
  do they talk about the possibility of d\u00e9tente ? 
   local geographically near you  commentators pundits , talking heads , analysts, 
  short and sweet . 
  we actually teach that telegram in the us , which is significant because our history classes offer only the lightest detail for wwi . 
  we also paint the submarines as dastardly , without the reasons you allude to above ( which i take to be fair enough , as war goes ) . 
  supposedly , the convention when sinking a civilian ship is to pick everyone up . 
  obviously , a u-boat ca n't do that , so they just drown . 
  this is one of the best threads we 've had in months . 
  cain , judas , and lenin ? 
  i would be most okay with lenin by far . 
  there are at least varying opinions on lenin , whereas cain and judas are synonymous with evil throughout the western world . 
   the last ninth circle of hell is divided into 4 rounds according to the seriousness of the sin though all residents are frozen in an icy lake . 
  those who committed more severe sin are deeper within the ice . 
  each of the 4 rounds is named after an individual who personifies the sin . 
  thus ** round 1 is named caina after cain who killed his brother abel , ** round 2 is named antenora after anthenor of troy who was priam 's counselor during the trojan war , round 3 is named ptolomaea after ptolemy ( son of abubus ) , ** while round 4 is named judecca after judas iscariot , the apostle who betrayed jesus with a kiss ** http://historylists.org/art/9-circles-of-hell-dantes-inferno.html, 
   you ca n't name your son cain , judas or lenin although i personally have heavy libertarian leanings , i 'm fine with name laws like this . 
  just give your kid a normal fucking name , people . 
  there is a story on / r/cfb right now about a college football player whose parents named him my-king . 
  his sister 's name is a-queen .
