  well , we 're in the ` everything else ' phase . 
  france will just have to take one for the team . 
  merci !, 
  if i 'm going to fantasize about a french politician , she may as well be president . 
  her tug-of-war partner certainly thinks so . 
  one day . 
  one day . 
  i ca n't get past the eyebrows , personally . 
  why does she look mildly heavy-set in real clothes ? 
  perplexing . 
  totally . 
  and of course we ca n't take this as an accident . 
  with tarantino , everything is deliberate . 
  re-watch the baseball bat scene , and you will notice wicki , the austrian jew , at one point has a yellow leaf in the shape of a star on his jacket . 
  i claim this is deliberate -- it 's a star of david . 
  ( what `` meaning '' it has beyond his being jewish and symbolic of the patch he would 've worn , i have no idea . ), 
  i honestly ca n't think of a better example of actor-to-character `` fit '' , if you will , than waltz-landa . 
  by that i mean : a ) all-time great character and b ) played by the absolute perfect guy to play him . 
  if you turned this into a math equation , i do n't think you could find a higher ` a * b ` than waltz playing landa . 
  you could find some on the same level , but not higher . 
  also , if someone other than king killed his brother , why would he leave germany ? 
  why not stay in germany and use his marksmanship skills to find revenge ? 
  aha , that 's a good read . 
  my read is more thematic : king is supposed to sound like cain . 
  it certainly sounds that way in the song . 
  `` his name is kane . '', 
  ( and quentin does work closely with his soundtrack artists . ), 
  cain , like king , is a killer with a brother . 
  did king kill his brother ? 
  presumably not , because `` he found his brother dead . '', 
  yet , for such a massive event as the death of a brother , the song says strangely little about it . 
  no info on the killer or the circumstances . 
  this would explain why a german dentist moved to america . 
  to escape the law . 
  also , cain has strong connections to slavery in the us . 
  some proponents of slavery actually believed that black skin was the `` mark of cain . '', 
  meaning that blacks were descendents of cain , punished by god himself , and that their enslavement was righteous in his eyes . 
  so we have king . 
  now , schulz :  schulz is a common german and jewish-ashkenazi family name in northern germany . 
  the german word schulz originates from the local official known as schulthei\u00df or ( dorf - ) schulz ( e ) , a ** local law enforcement officer ** like a police officer , magistrate , bailiff or mayor . 
  or was that schultz ? 
   schultz name meaning . 
  german : status name for a village headman , from a contracted form of middle high german schultheize . 
  the term originally denoted a ** man responsible for collecting dues and paying them to the lord of the manor ; ** it is a compound of sculd ( a ) ` debt ' , ` due ' + a derivative of heiz ( z ) an ` to command ' . 
  and yet , if we can go from king to cain , we can go from schultz to schuld . 
  debt , blame , * guilt . 
  * so , is king debtor or debt-collector ? 
  well , he 's not a sinner , not when we see him . 
  he kills bad guys . 
  but he 's not a `` local law enforcement officer '' either -- he 's a bounty hunter . 
  it 's a profession of ... dubious reputation . 
  i say , why not both ? 
  in his guilt over killing his brother , he assumes a new life as a sort of angel of death sent to deliver the lord 's judgment . 
  `` and when he shot ... at other men , he never mii-issed . '', 
   dr. king schultz ( btw king is not a first name over here , just to be clear )  if i remember , one of the songs says his brother was killed . 
  you should download the soundtrack and give it a couple listens . 
  i wo n't say anything else , because it 's better to go in `` cold '' and form your own conclusions . 
  but if you enjoy this kind of analysis , and you seem to , you should download it . 
  ( do it . ), 
  well , he tells a german fairy tale that django derives his own hero story from . 
  and it 's not just a fairy tale , it 's a * german * fairy tale ( `` it 's a german fairy tale , of course there 's a mountain '' ) . 
  so i think it 's germans in particular , not europeans generally . 
  although , a point for your side would be the references to the frenchman dumas and the three musketeers . 
  100 % my perspective as well . 
  it 's almost like those d&d charts [ ( example ) ] ( http://www.gamehead.com/sites/default/files/images/article/inline_files/1470/beyond-good-and-evil-the-alignments-of-dd-8g4bo1e.jpeg ) most wwii movies have 2-3 of those squares filled . 
  here , you have good/bad/neither people on both sides . 
  the french translator , for example , is an opportunist on the allied side . 
  i think the references to native americans have something to do with the above theme . 
  we brutalized those people . 
  right ? 
  well , kind of . 
  as with wwii , it 's more complex than good guys and bad guys . 
  aldo takes pride in his apache heritage ( despite being 1/64th apache -- very american , carrying on ... ) . 
  for a real-world example , the civil war general william tecumseh sherman had the middle name tecumseh for a reason -- and the reason was n't that his parents hated tecumseh . 
  this despite the fact that he was born at the height of american/indian ( bi-directional ) hostility . 
  the simple good-vs-evil depiction of history does us no good . 
  but we 're also addicted to it . 
  you have to give br\u00fchl credit , though . 
  the character is annoying , but he does n't want to be . 
  he wants to be suave . 
  so br\u00fchl himself is being intentionally unintentionally annoying , which is quite a feat . 
  not easy . 
  ah , good observation !, 
  follow-up question : assuming you 've seen django , a ) how significant was it that tarantino , who is probably the most well-respected director in film today , went right back to christoph waltz for his next picture ? 
  b ) in django , he portrays germans and german-ness in a positive light and americans in a ( mostly ) negative light . 
  to wit :  calvin candie : your boss looks a little green around the gills . 
   django : he just ai n't used to seein ' a man ripped apart by dogs is all . 
   calvin candie : but you are used to it ? 
   django : i 'm just a little more used to americans than he is . 
  i 'm not sure what to make of it , but i do n't think it 's an accident , one movie following so quickly after the other . 
  what do you think ? 
  ( `` of course he does '' or `` of course he did . '', 
  either works . 
  a movie sort of `` stands outside '' of time and therefore tense . ), 
  yep . 
  i 'm not saying he 's wrong . 
  i 'm saying tarantino saw fit to have him say it . 
  being that the word ` terrorism / - ist ' was not nearly so common in the '40s as it is today , we have to guess that tarantino is aiming that comment at the audience in some way rather than simply putting appropriate lines into a character 's mouth . 
  it 's not a throwaway line . 
  yeah , in interviews , mike really plays up his cultural connection to england through his parents , but i 'm not sure how seriously to take that .
