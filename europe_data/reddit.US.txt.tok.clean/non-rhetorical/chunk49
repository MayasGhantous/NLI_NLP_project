  did you think the same of austin powers 's accent ? 
  i ask because i think there was a message of sorts -- perhaps multiple . 
  i do n't think the allusions to native americans ( aldo the apache , the bar scene ) were an accident . 
  nor was the fact that landa refers to the operation as a `` terrorist plot . '', 
  but maybe i 'm overthinking it . 
   now what about `` obamacare '' ? 
  if donald abolishes it , there will be thousands of americans who die immediately . 
  this is supposed to be ironic , right ? 
  you 're demonstrating with an american example what exaggerated news looks like , yes ? 
  naturally , you did n't complain , because you 're a hufflepuff . 
  you can do it with hyphenated words . 
  i 've done it , and i 've seen professional writers do it . 
  i 'm struggling to think of a real example though . 
  you would definitely not write , `` pro-life and - choice demonstrators marched tuesday to have their views heard . '', 
  now that i think of it , i think you can only do it if the latter halves of the two/more words are the same . 
  `` pro- and anti-eu demonstrators '' does n't sound amazing , but it sounds a lot better than `` pro-life and - choice . '', 
  is it huge enough to be a bigger deal than the risk of putting your cities on the same list as hiroshima and nagasaki ? 
  people trotted that same theory out in the early 1900s ( or was it the late 1800s ? 
  ) , and they were wrong . 
  it 's not ** impossible ** . 
  let 's use clear and precisely correct language here . 
  it 's not impossible to attack a nuclear power or an economic ally . 
  neither is impossible . 
  if you attack a nuclear power ( or an ally of a nuclear power ) , you run the risk of millions of your citizens being incinerated in the blink of an eye . 
  if you attack an economic ally , the cost not nearly so clear . 
  is there a cost ? 
  yes . 
  is it impossible to offset by the future longterm economic gains in people/land/resources ? 
  possibly yes , possibly no . 
  the first thing is the more powerful deterrent to war . 
  it 's beyond obvious . 
   i guess a lot of people have already forgotten that our ancestors had to fight each other all the time still 70 years ago . 
  i 'm surprised -- not speechless , just surprised -- that people a ) accept as fact and b ) expect others to accept as fact that the eu prevents war from breaking out . 
  do n't get me wrong , i understand the idea : `` cooperation begets friendliness . '', 
  yet history is replete with examples of alliances turning sour . 
  imo , it 's far easier to attribute the 70-year peace to nuclear weapons . 
  nobody in their right mind would start a full-scale war when the playing field is so uneven . 
  why look to the eu as the explanation when such an obvious answer is staring you in the face ? 
  i do n't understand it . 
  also , i just want to add an atypical reason to support the electoral college . 
  until the whole country has `` perfect '' voting machines , i do n't want a national vote on anything . 
  the precise results are already highly questionable ( i can go into detail on this ) , but at least you can guarantee that foul play is limited in scope . 
  if rigging machines and throwing out ballots is going to affect a national vote , there 's no limit to what some people might do . 
  texas and california would accuse each other of everything under the sun . 
  show me a solution with real technological integrity , then we 'll talk . 
  until then , the ec mitigates * a lot * of risk that people do n't even realize is out there . 
  precisely . 
  and if the pact ever gets ` triggered ' , i would predict a massive shit show . 
  electors would n't hold to it -- not all of them , not if it changed the outcome . 
  there would be legal battles for weeks , maybe months after election day . 
  it would probably go to the supreme court , because its constitutionality is questionable . 
  2000 would look like child 's play by comparison . 
  it 's the same here . 
  iirc , 2 % of americans can name their congressional representative . 
  ( i am part of the 98 % . ), 
  call me when someone other than a hard blue state signs on . 
  interesting . 
  what sort of autonomy rights are we talking about ? 
  why treat one city differently than another ? 
  does this have its roots in those independent cities that were prominent trading outposts ? 
  i recall a post of yours on that recently . 
  i remember thinking it was an interesting conundrum . 
  something about the constitution guaranteeing municipalities a certain amount of power , yes ? 
  explain it again ? 
  after wiki-ing , i am going to blame this on there being three amendments in the '60s . 
  most recent cluster ? 
  sure . 
  that 's what it was . 
  thanks anyways !, 
  i knew i should have looked that up . 
  when i was younger , i had a mind like a steel trap !, 
  now , look at me . 
  i will give an example . 
  lots of americans think we should dump the electoral college . 
  they seem not to comprehend that this is politically next-to-impossible . 
  a ) it would require a constitutional amendment . 
  over 10,000 amendments have been proposed ; 27 have been adopted . 
  if you were to graph the frequency of new amendments over time , it would be slowing down exponentially ( 10/27 are in the bill of rights ; the most recent amendment passed in the 1960s . ), 
  so the bar for any amendment is already very high . 
  b ) there are two methods for amending the constitution . 
  * 2/3 majority vote in both the house and the senate ( 26 cases ) * 3/4 of the states vote to adopt ( one case ) in either case , the smaller states would need to vote against their own interest , which is highly unlikely . 
  why would wyoming want to give itself less influence in determining the president ? 
  it would n't . 
  same . 
  a trampoline house . 
  that 's the most german `` fun '' i 've ever heard of . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ change ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ polish ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ heart . 
  i agree . 
  from my perspective , there are three world capitals : nyc , tokyo , and london . 
  when i listen to bcc world in my jeep , the locales covered are a constant reminder of the expanse of the former empire . 
  yes , it goes without saying that the queen can no longer command indian troops -- that class of influence is gone -- but your relationships with former colonies have n't disappeared and are in fact friendlier than competitors ' . 
  the `` five eyes '' alone represent 450 million people , the same as the eu . 
  india is three times that size . 
  sa has the highest gdp in africa . 
  again , we 're not all under your rule , but the influence is there . 
  and however much influence there is , it is multiplied by the size and success of your former colonies which , again , outstrips other former colonial powers by far . 
  i would not hesitate to label the uk the european country with the most global influence , both for my listed reasons and the ones you already cited . 
   the eu is pretty decent , but time to time it tries to regulate things it frankly should stay the fuck out of . 
  can i push you to give an example or two ? 
   r/shitamericanssay  i did n't figure the germans would waste the space .
