  here , laser tag places are housed in large , warehouse-sized buildings . 
   he 's just a target of a meme . 
  sure , that 's how it started . 
  if you look at their front page right now , though , there is a 28-upvote , 2-hour-old link to marchforeurope.eu . 
  that 's not ironic . 
  there 's no joke there . 
  or you ca n't admit that it 's fun , so you have to do it `` ironically , '' like teenagers playing laser tag . 
  do they have laser tag in germany ? 
  it 's great . 
  i mean the subreddit itself . 
  you can claim satire until the ends of the earth , but at a certain point , it 's not satire anymore . 
  you 're just * doing * the * thing . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ copying ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ america, 
  my man . 
  to me , one of the harshest criticisms you can give of the modern world is that it no longer produces individuals of that caliber . 
  when ben franklin was born in boston , ma , it was the most populous city in the united states ... at around 8,000 . 
  we are not , today , producing ben franklins at a rate of one per 8,000 . 
  not even close . 
  just give them to me . 
  i 'll make sure poland gets them ... 
  all fair points , but at least give them the polish books back . 
  you guys ca n't read them anyway . 
  i have created a thread for the general topic of war plunder , btw , inspired by this post . 
  thank you , that certainly clears things up . 
  100 euros is such a paltry amount that i was halfway between `` russia sent romania 100 euro '' and `` russia sent 100 euro to thousands of individual romanian citizens . '', 
  you guys did the right thing . 
  both the romanian citizens and the ministry of foreign affairs . 
  even accepting that the russians are a little odd , i still ca n't comprehend who at the embassy thought that was a good idea . 
  in what year did this take place ? 
   c ) our treasury was sent to russia in wwi for safekeeping . 
  they 've never returned it to us . 
  we 're talking 120 tones of gold plus valuable objects . 
  holy shit ... 
  russia is my little brother . 
  got it . 
  i 'm not sure i understand your last bullet point . 
  the russian government sent the romanian government 100 euros ? 
  honest question : was sophie really that much more important than her collaborators , or does she get extra attention for being female ? 
  anecdotally , do you think chatham house 's survey is approximately correct ? 
  that a majority would favor a ban of some kind ? 
   in the university of pennsylvania 's 2015 global go to think tanks report , chatham house is ranked the second most influential think tank in the world after the brookings institution , and the world 's most influential non-u.s. think tank . 
  [ 1 ] in 2009 , chatham house was also named the top non-u.s. think tank by foreign policy magazine , which listed it as one of the top `` scholars '' for being among a handful of stars of the think-tank world who are regularly relied upon to set agendas and craft new initiatives . 
  it 's been a while , but ... * remembering noun genders . 
  it 's hard to develop an ear for it . 
  * irregular verbs . 
  * the higher-level grammatical stuff . 
  subjunctive i vs ii .

  another one . 
  til what ` lustration ' is . 
  my spellcheck does n't know it either . 
  * extremely off-topic : *  allochthonous  autochthonous one learns the most interesting words from foreigners . 
  the impression i get is that they have some very precise , yet commonplace word `` x '' in their mother language , and everyone in that country decides that the way you say `` x '' in english is `` y. '', 
  in the last 10 years , [ the ny times has used the word just 10 times ] ( https://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/?action=click&amp;contentcollection&amp;region=topbar&amp;wt.nav=searchwidget&amp;module=searchsubmit&amp;pgtype=homepage#/autochthonous/since1851/allresults/1/allauthors/newest/ ) , and most of those are quotations , not ` genuine ' uses by the writer . 
  yet those 10 represent an uptick . 
  in the '90s , it was used 3 times . 
  from 2002-06 , it was n't used once . 
  edit : 5 uses in the 1880s , when they were publishing ( in all likelihood ) far fewer words/day . 
  4/5 are genuine uses . 
  interesting . 
  did the census question include the bullet points , or are those your own annotations ? 
  i assume the former , due the formal style , but maybe you 're a formal guy . 
  also , do you mean `` forbidden '' as in a ) the government does not collect/publish stats , or b ) nobody is allowed to collect/publish stats ? 
   what happened during wwii is a good example of that do you mean in france or the more obvious example of the nazis ? 
  i 'm not aware of what the first sentence might refer to . 
  throw it at me , bro !, 
  yeah , i did n't care for bb either . 
  it had its moments , but i could n't even finish s04 . 
  true detective a crime drama , but it 's also not a crime drama . 
  yes , you 're following policemen . 
  yes , they are investigating a crime . 
  it departs from the genre at that point . 
  i do n't even know what to compare it to . 
  watch one episode . 
  one . 
  hmm . 
  mexico could be a better neighbor , to be honest . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/world/americas/a-mexican-manual-for-illegal-migrants-upsets-some-in-us.html?_r=0 note the date . 
  you seen true detective s01 ? 
  that 's my favorite season of tv i 've seen in the last few years . 
  it also showcases a side of america you do n't see too often -- and not in a positive light . 
  bum bum bummm . 
  you 're right , i do n't care !, 
  cute puppers !, 
  where are you going to get gas ? 
  huh ? 
  you think they 'll just have `` stations '' waiting for you ? 
  unlike gas , you can find hay anywhere . 
  i voted for obama in ' 08 , and i was still glad she did n't let him . 
  that nobel peace prize went to his head . 
  the word * ein * has nothing to do with it ? 
  hmm . 
  i did not know that !, 
  yeah , i 've heard the tape . 
  there 's this half-moment of quiet -- i suspect before everyone realizes what he 's trying to say -- and then just thunderous cheering . 
  - i am so glad merkel turned down obama 's request to speak at the site of the jfk speech . 
  ( this was years ago . 
  i assume you remember . ), 
  reminds me of `` ich bin ein berliner . '', 
  this question is ridiculous .
