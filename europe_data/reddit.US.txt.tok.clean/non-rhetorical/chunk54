   ** `` if you ask me , more countries will leave , '' he said ** there you go , pal . 
  that 's a projection . 
  more will leave . 
  i 've supported my position . 
  you support yours . 
  you 're a joke , dude . 
  he 's * projecting bad things * for the eu , not openly declaring that he will `` contribute to the eu 's destruction . '', 
  you conflate the two because you 're dishonest . 
  okay , that 's the third time you 've refused to support your claim . 
  you 're deliberately trying to pull this convo in any other direction you can to avoid having to defend what you said . 
  i 've seen this movie before . 
  just admit you 're misrepresenting what he said . 
  have an ounce of intellectual honesty . 
  oh , so he did n't actually say he wants the destruction of the eu . 
  thanks for the cunty reply . 
  wow . 
  do you write down vocab lists or anything , though ? 
  study the grammar ? 
  not to say federalism is inherently superior , but to say , we 're not what we tell ourselves we are . 
  i think i might just delete it , tbh . 
  going to give it another few minutes to see how people respond to what 's already in the thread . 
  has the well been irredeemably soiled , or is there still hope ? 
  o/t , but the sad truth is , we 've been marching from the one to the other since our formation , and accelerated at various points between then and now . 
  thanks for your help !, 
  why does that help with acquisition ? 
  and if it does , why is it that we ( at least here ) place a strong emphasis on everyday situations like asking where the restroom is ? 
  ( this is not a `` challenge , '' if it sounds like one . 
  i 'm highly critical of what we do in classrooms myself . ), 
  i know , i know . 
  nonetheless , i wanted to avoid it . 
   tabling good god , that must cause some problems . 
  i had no idea !, 
  i think i know how i got confused . 
  we talk about fed - vs. confed - ( relevant to not just the confederate states in the south , but also the articles of confederation ) . 
  that 's the whole ballgame to us , a sliding scale between one and the other . 
  is there a word to describe the uk setup ? 
  do you primarily use ` unitary ' ? 
  alright , now we 're getting somewhere . 
  what makes scotland different from california , legally speaking ? 
  they have a parliament after all . 
  california has a state legislature . 
  they both make laws that apply within their boundaries and nowhere else . 
  ah yes , i see now . 
  and i accept that as truth , but what i mean is that austrians who speak english on the internet use `` federal '' seemingly in the same way belgians and scotsmen do , and not the way americans do . 
  i perceive this especially for words describing political systems . 
  language is tricky . 
  translation is a business of approximation . 
  i get that . 
  nonetheless , i certainly perceive this pattern . 
  there are words , especially in the realm of describing political systems , that the two continents use differently . 
  redditors have a nasty habit of not reading the op unless you make it catchy . 
  even if it 's short , they just pass right by it sometimes . 
  someone in another thread said people do n't understand that belgium is a federal state . 
  obviously , i should just go ask him , but what do you suppose he means by that , and why would people misunderstand that fact ? 
  are not all european states federal in some aspect ? 
  what do you mean by ` accordingly ' ? 
  i can think of more than one thing you might be saying . 
  talking about words is hard !, 
  i feel like this thread is already doomed , thanks to my imprecision with language . 
  should 've taken more time to get the op exactly right . 
  no and yes , respectively . 
  what is federal , what is not federal . 
  each definition is objective , however , whereas no definition of conservative is objective . 
  in fact , the meaning of conservatism changes not just person to person but also generally over time . 
  does this help ? 
  to give an example , in case it 's unclear : in the us , * federal * is almost interchangeable with * national . 
  * in the early 20th century , there was even a third baseball league that competed ( for market share , not on the field ) with the american and national leagues called the federal league . 
  it lasted two years , iirc . 
  in europe , it seems to mean something about how the government is set up , but i ca n't exactly tell what . 
  i assume something to do with the way the national and subnational level entities relate to one another . 
  i always thought it was weird that the cia publishes this . 
  like , i get that it 's not a lot of work , but still , why are they doing it ? 
  publishing encyclopedic information for public use is not really their function as an agency . 
  like , even a little . 
  hey , the way i heard it , it was five to a rifle . 
  maybe that was just the ukrainians , though -- i hear stalin did n't like them ( accepted fact ) . 
  i would say two things . 
  first , if you asked the man on the street , if he had an answer at all , it would be `` they pay higher taxes '' ( af ) . 
  second , the opinion itself would be a bit of a political platypus . 
  to use oversimplified labels , it 's both pro-military and pro-universal healthcare . 
  ( yes , with even a tiny injection of nuance , you do n't need to see it that way , but just follow me . ), 
  the groups advocating those positions * do not * overlap ( af ) ; individuals could believe it , but it could never `` go viral '' and become an af . 
  interesting discussion . 
  thanks for your thoughts . 
  when did he say that ? 
  really , an enemy ? 
  if by parts you mean geographic locations , then no ; the common man does not discuss european healthcare with enough frequency for that idea ( or any other about where it derives from ) to rise to the level of `` accepted fact . '', 
  what you 're seeing is a common-ish internet opinion . 
  i would settle for a couple premiere league teams . 
  we 're putting an nfl team in london , after all . 
  no , i agree with you . 
  we have an innate desire to expand our influence . 
  exhibit b : monroe doctrine . 
   the us has such power against ** single ** nations true , but then that 's , imo , what 's driving the growth of the eu as a `` player '' in its own right . 
  the europeans have realized that they can project a lot more power as 450mm people ( would be 3rd in pop . 
  rankings ) than individually , where even germany is 17th , let alone poor denmark . 
  yet no good idea goes uncopied . 
  would the uk rather negotiate trade deals as 65mm people or as part of the five eyes ( which coincidentally total 450mm as well ) ? 
  the question , as you allude to , is what the us gets out of it . 
  i thought all that went without saying , which is why i only brought up favorable points .
