  look elsewhere in the thread , where i say the au would of course be a `` weak '' union . 
  why ? 
  as a guy who used to transcribe interviews for pocket money ( my dad was a newspaper reporter ) , germans are way easier to understand than romance speakers . 
  `` you have to cut the part '' * american : `` yu hafta cut the part . '', 
  * german : `` yoo haav to kutsepart . '', 
  * french : `` ou av to kaa zpaa . '', 
  hey , take it as a compliment . 
  you 're not ** a ** continent , you 're ** the ** continent . 
  how nice !, 
  i largely agree , which is why i think it would have to be a `` weak '' union . 
  then , because it 's weak , how much is there to dominate , really ? 
  how demanding can the us be when a ) there are relatively few items of collaboration anyway , and b ) when it 's a lot easier for australia to walk away than , say , the netherlands from the eu ? 
  in the abstract , that 's my instinct as well , but i also question what that would even look like . 
  honestly , i think a lot of this post-brexit `` anglo union '' talk represents the uk psychologically wrestling with the breakup . 
  unlike when you break up with your gf , however , there are zero other fish in the sea . 
  hence the uk invents its own . 
  now , all that said ... the idea is honestly not terrible . 
  when you compare the eu with the potential au , the au wins on a couple points ( from britain 's perspective in picking a gf ) : * common language , shared history , yada yada * huge , maybe : us , uk , can , aus , nz are much , much nearer each other in terms of gdp/capita * uk wo n't be the odd one out in terms of being an island nation or keeping her currency * borders , borders , borders !, 
  only the us and canada even share one , so the uk can do whatever the eff it wants on that point . 
  now , will the idea ever come to fruition ? 
  likely not , but these things rarely do . 
  it 's not impossible , though . 
  thanks . 
  really , i 'm having a hard time sorting out how common these experiences are , because 90 % are saying yes . 
  reminiscent of traudl junge 's description of hitler in private . 
  polite , conscientious , etc. 
   apart from that , you can very much be proud to be german . 
  just not because of our history . 
  for everything else , people are usually quite impressed with germany and give us a lot of credit . 
  strong parallels with japan here . 
  yes , japan has its problems -- birth rate , overwork , tentacle porn -- but the world today would be staggeringly less advanced ( and entertaining ) without japan 's contributions . 
  same for germany . 
  which is remarkable in the big picture given the material and human resources `` spent '' on that war , to use a terrible euphemism . 
  not everyone would recover from that , given the same circumstances , * let alone * rise to an even higher order of respect and admiration than they ( germany or japan ) had before . 
  ivan , i thought i told you to throw away that damn nazi flag !, 
  `` what ? 
  looks cool , no ? '', 
  we 're not nazis !, 
  `` we 're not in nato , either . '', 
  probably the way to go, 
  o/t : hitler had a conveniently expansive definition of aryan . 
  holy shit , plot twist . 
  how did you react ? 
   the average woman in 50 years if the implication is that we 'll all be beige , that 's all bs anyways . 
  4 % of white americans have black ancestors and do n't even know about it ( self included , until recently ) , because skin color does n't work like mixing paint . 
  my bff in elementary school was a light-skinned black kid whose parents were both dark-skinned . 
  it just does n't work like people think . 
  policemen really have a thankless job sometimes . 
  or technically you do get thanked , but not by someone you would want to talk to . 
  there was another one , too , though . 
  iirc , they were within a couple years of each other . 
  close enough that people were like , `` oh , yeah i already heard about him . 
  nah bro , there 's another one . 
  `` another ? '', 
  austrian * again * . 
  that 's kind of ironic , as alexander sought to bring olive-skins and brown-skins together , no ? 
  i know , i know . 
  making fun of obviously stupid beliefs is low-hanging fruit . 
  but give me this one . 
  where did you see the first guy ? 
  i googled him . 
  dude travels a lot . 
  [ also , he , his wife , and his son all dress like idiots . 
  i googled `` kkk cross '' and that 's what came up . 
  honestly did n't know what it was called -- only that it was red , white , and a cross . 
  the point is that you would n't mistake it for a religious cross . 
  at least , an american would n't . 
  that thing means klan . 
   you know the type of child who pulls the wings of flies yeah , i know the type . 
  hopefully the parents do n't blame themselves . 
  those kids are `` born , not made , '' as we say in english . 
  i can see what you mean . 
  it 's one thing to put a confederate flag sticker on your truck ( possibly racist , possibly questionable judgment ) , but another thing to put a [ blood drop cross ] ( http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/blood-drop-cross-1.jpg ) sticker ( one meaning and one meaning only ) . 
  very interesting , thanks for sharing . 
  jeez . 
  kinda funny though , on the same day they 're remembering hitler , high school kids in america are smoking weed before they go to school . 
  haha . 
  how obvious is it , exactly ? 
  can you say with 99 % certainty that certain guys are definitely neo-nazis ? 
  interesting . 
  did they march in cities , like a parade ? 
  out in the country where no one can see , as a sort of togetherness/bonding thing ? 
  what do the marches entail ? 
  hmm . 
  mobile chrome is not giving me the `` translate '' option , so , unfortunately , no . 
  thank you , though !, 
   their facebook posts ... 
  example ? 
  actually , give me the worst one you can think of . 
  i thought the bullets were different song titles . 
  `` damn , already two songs about bears , no songs about any other animals . 
  the bear must have a special position in dutch culture . '', 
  competing theories exist . 
  the one i find most compelling is that the work was a form of taxation owed to the state , and was performed during the agricultural off-season . 
  to me , that 's * a form of * slave labor in that you probably do n't want to do it , but you have to anyway , etc etc fair enough . 
  i would n't say i was ` proud ' of the atom bombs , for example , even if they were impressive inventions . 
  i appreciate your looking out for me . 
  really , i find it touching . 
  i can say stuff like this because the human mind compartmentalizes things . 
  even where * logically * impossible , we can still separate * in our minds * , for example : a ) the grandeur of the pyramids of giza and b ) the slave labor that built them .
