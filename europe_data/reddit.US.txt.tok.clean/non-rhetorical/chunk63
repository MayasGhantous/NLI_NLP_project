  but zee is defensible . 
  they 're called bee , see , and dee , not bed , sed , and ded . 
  get with the program , z !, 
  follow-up question : have you so much as heard it discussed irl ? 
  even if you set the question of interest aside ( which you do n't need to - you are 100 % correct above ) , it is frankly very difficult to immerse yourself in foreign politics . 
  there is an immense amount of background knowledge required to understand even the smallest news stories . 
  much of said knowledge is not available in a simple , serialized format . 
  it 's the kind of knowledge you would only accumulate by watching the news for 20 years . 
  so like spider-man throwing his web , kind of, 
  do n't forget * jingle all the way * !, 
  as far as conspiracy theories ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldiweg9xq-m mighty suspicious if you ask me . 
  i was led to believe it was a joint irish-canadian project , though perhaps that 's what they mean by joint ? 
  sometimes it 's hard to tell with these things . 
  if we were doing tv shows , you could say vikings . 
  too bad they killed off aethelstan , though . 
  his relationship with ragnar was compelling for me . 
  you guys ever see becket ( 1964 ) ? 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057877/ really amazing film . 
  o'toole and burton at their best !, 
  we had the counterfeiters in theatres over here . 
  very good film !, 
   let 's see your three op . 
  the godfather i & ii ( 1972 and 74 ) . 
  one of the rare cases where a popular thing really does deserve every inch of praise it receives . 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/ it 's a wonderful life ( 1946 ) . 
  a christmas movie that 's not about christmas . 
  every time i watch it , it 's different . 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/ the matrix ( 1999 ) . 
  an unconventional pick this high up , but this is my list !, 
  i 'm picking it . 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/ as if to prove my point , google tells me some local theatre is showing it at midnight tonight . 
  favorite of mine as well !, 
  if you liked that , give doc of the dead a watch . 
  interesting little documentary on the history of zombies in film . 
  simon pegg is in it , as is george romero and the guy who wrote world war z. romero said * shaun * was his favorite zombie movie not made by him !, 
   and aircraft carries would be irrelevant anyway to a military with a defensive purpose . 
  yeah , you just snap your fingers and aircraft carriers appear . 
  incredibly easy . 
  seems plausible ... 
  i once attended a concert by a german band called faust . 
  iirc , they formed in the '70s . 
  anyway , the backdrop of the performance ( the entire time ) was the 1920s silent film version of faust . 
  just , behind them on the wall . 
  just there . 
  the first ** 15 minutes ** of the performance were the lead singer sprinkling gravel into an old cement mixer , in silence . 
  during one song , the drummer took a thunder sheet ( rectangular piece of metal that sounds like thunder when you shake it ) , hung it from a piece of tubing , and slashed at the sheet with an electric handheld saw . 
   easily http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/carriers-2014.gif those things take like five years to build . 
  once it were `` really necessary , '' it would already be far too late . 
  oh , thank god . 
  i thought it was just me . 
  til . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  my question with secessionist movements is always , what happens with the national debt ? 
  do the scots/catalans/etc . 
  take on x % of it , or do they refuse because the accumulation debt is a factor in why they want to leave ? 
  anyway , if you can improve your situation , why not do it ? 
  you 'll have the unique opportunity to push the reset button on the legal system . 
  everyone will be super jealous . 
  yes , some character by the name of paul weston who is a candidate for something or other . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb7en-eu0x8 the text is derogatory , but there is no incitement of violence . 
  just commentary on what kinds of cultures muslim nations tend to produce . 
  how is it `` next to nothing '' ? 
  he got arrested . 
  the public discourse has been infringed upon , and * not * to prevent genocide . 
  free speech issues tend to be settled by clear and present danger . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clear_and_present_danger  as long as you are not trying to incite racial hatred or calling for genocide , then you wo n't have any problem with freedom of speech laws . 
  what about the dude who got arrested for quoting churchill on islam ? 
  the charges were dropped , but still . 
  i do n't think that would happen here . 
  you know where your bread is buttered . 
  so what are you guys doing this weekend, 
  to soften the blow of calling people dumb for disagreeing with her . 
  edit : , 
   some american guy arguing that these bans were ** illegal ** using the us constitution . . 
  pretty sure he 's not actually , actually , actually doing that . 
  he alludes to the 1st amendment as a principle he believes his audience will agree with , then argues that clothing bans violate that principle . 
  the version i have heard is trees , paris , and hitler . 
  czech yourself before you wreck yourself, 
  `` bad teeth '' is older than cosmetic whitening . 
  it is also nowhere near common enough that natural colored teeth would look weird . 
  muslim jokes : played out . 
  holocaust jokes : still in . 
  interest , interest . 
  123 fake st.  interesting !, 
  i love a good korean reaction video . 
  a bbq man prides himself on his ribs , so that 's definitely my recommendation . 
  if you go , ask him what his specialty is . 
  judge us on that . 
  my family and i went to one in germany . 
  it was really bad . 
  so was the chinese place we tried . 
  this was in frankfurt . 
  the actual german food was amazing , however . 
  in his defense , it 's really hard to get a straight answer out of anyone . 
  some euros say the sky is falling , others say nothing is happening . 
  for myself , i suspect 99.99 % is a slight exaggeration . 
  surely more than one in 10,000 persons has been affected . 
  also , i would n't be me if i did n't point out how willing euros are to judge the us from afar . 
  i say all this with respect . 
  imo , you 're one of the most intelligent commentors on here .
