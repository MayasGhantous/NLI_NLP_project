  * i 'm turkish ... but i 'm not turkic * asia minor * the non-muslim part of turkey * a non-muslim part of turkey * let 's just say i hold a turkish passport and leave it at that . 
  judge me by my good ideas , not my bad ones . 
  -- we also have an english idiom you may find useful . 
  may . 
  it 's more about location than ethnicity . 
  for example , i was born in ohio , and my family is from ohio , but most of my years have been spent in washington , dc -- enough that i identify as a washingtonian . 
  if someone asks where i 'm from , i can say `` ohio via dc '' or `` ohio by way of dc . '', 
  i do n't want to put words in his mouth , but i think op means `` what are you ` known for ' ... to yourselves '' if that makes sense . 
  for example , a number of cities in ohio , where i 'm from , have a single `` thing '' that they , historically , have produced for the auto makers to our north in detroit , michigan . 
  toledo does glass , akron does rubber . 
  pittsburgh , which is just outside ohio in neighboring pennsylvania , does steel . 
  not coincidentally , the state of west virginia , which pittsburgh is also very near , is known for coal . 
  coal , as you are aware , is used to make steel . 
  everyone has their `` thing . '', 
  some are famous , most are n't . 
  ( my examples are imperfect , as op is asking for trades , not industries , but it 's the best i can do . ), 
  they get around that by claiming they 're enemy combatants . 
  however you feel about that morally , it 's not a terrible argument , legally . 
  regardless , when you elect a constitutional law professor who says over and over while campaigning that he 's going to shut gitmo down and eight years later it 's still running , you know something is up . 
  but as i say further down , my real point is exclusively that nicole & friends do n't know what the fuck they 're talking about , which is more than a little ironic given the complaints of american ignorance regarding european law . 
  there are a million correct answers she could have given . 
  really . 
  she could have picked * just about anything . 
  * do we not even care about the facts ? 
  so long as the sentiment is anti-american , we can claim whatever we want and no one will challenge it ? 
  i ca n't even tell you how disgusted i am . 
  where is the intellectual honesty ? 
  it bothers me because i feel like there 's a cottage industry for pooping on america . 
  like , this is a * market desire . 
  * nicole did not claim torture was unconstitutional by applying her understating of constitutional law . 
  she did it by parroting what she heard elsewhere , and she assumed it was true because she wanted to . 
  right , but the key difference is that in the case of murder , if the supposed murder victim shows up at work tomorrow , you would be obliged to admit i did n't murder him . 
  which is to say there is a real-world constraint on interpretation . 
  no such constraint exists when it comes to interpreting speech . 
  you 're right , he is n't , but when i said that i meant to refer to the `` ignorant americans always say x , y , and z , act superior , etc '' complaints . 
  to be clear , i do n't take issue with those complaints . 
  ( how would i ? 
  it 's true , i know nothing about your laws . 
  i have no basis to comment on others ' interpretations . ), 
  however . 
  it is my feeling that , true or false , complaints of non-europeans ' ignorance of europe have no place in a subreddit called / r/askeurope . 
  nobody is going to want to ask questions if they are guaranteed to encounter hostility for having to ask . 
  fwiw , we have a thing called the `` clear and present danger test '' to decide this very issue . 
  as you can guess from the name , `` all romanians are monsters '' would n't qualify except in very particular circumstances everyone here is capable of imagining . 
  hey , i 'm not here to argue the constitutionality of anything else . 
  in my view , the top-level comment is 100 % correct . 
  torture just is n't one of those million items . 
  frankly , it 's embarrassing how many upvotes that comment has given the `` you are ignorant of our laws , please do not comment on them '' sentiment running through the rest of this thread . 
  obv , but the constitution does n't mention torture . 
  the closest thing i can think of is the 8th amendment ( cruel and unusual punishment ) , but that refers to court sentencing . 
  torture is not a * punishment * judges hand out to the guilty . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  worst . 
  rebel . 
  ever . 
  we did n't fight for independence . 
  we just declared it . 
   every time i talk to one they seem to suggest that the american separatists won the war on their own frankly , i do n't believe you . 
  every child in america learns about the french support . 
  we have that but with a bigger ball and without the paddles, 
  you can not possibly know how controversial a statement you 've just made . 
  i 'm not even saying you 're wrong , only that the subject is comically heated . 
   | presence | . 
   | : -- | : --  | olympic | not yet  | paralympic | not yet i enjoy the editor 's optimism, 
  in bocce , they 're not steel but they are nonetheless heavy . 
  anyone who picks one up for the first time is like , `` whoa . '', 
  probably not as heavy as steel , but what do i know . 
  how do you score ? 
  * n * closest balls from the same team ? 
  1st world -- us & allies 2nd -- soviets & allies 3rd -- other, 
  why is it tk ? 
  here it 's tj . 
  you could be forgiven , as new york 's other baseball team , the mets , do an ny overlay logo as well : http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fwjpoftcvpi/tbklcezp2hi/aaaaaaaaaei/v5anurfoele/s1600/ny-mets.png it 's a common style of sports logo , if the team has two words in their name .

  1-bedroom apartment : 1 br , separate living area studio : bedroom and living area , all in one . 
  basically four walls and a bathroom . 
  often not as cheap as it sounds , unfortunately . 
  as much as i see what you 're saying ( indeed , the parliament was the major difference i initially had in mind ) , i ca n't help but feel there is something more to the eu , even if i have no right to feel it . 
  groups are n't just who 's in , they 're who 's out . 
  groucho marx alluded to this when he famously said , `` i do n't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member . '', 
  the un and imf will take anyone , whereas nato and the eu will not . 
  interestingly , the two approximate dual roles of the state , defense and government . 
  still , you do n't pay taxes . 
  that point more than any other you bring up settles the matter , in my opinion . 
   it 's effectively just a national election for the specific policy area of foreign affairs rather than a regular one about all policy areas . 
  i wish we ( humans ) could do that for everything . 
  de-couple all these disparate policy areas from one another , and let people address them on an individual basis . 
  this is the # 1 failure of democracy , in my view . 
  all the services and responsibilities are bundled together . 
  imagine if you had to choose one company to provide both your car and your microwave and your food . 
  sure , mitsubishi services each of those areas , but the market would not grow and mature in the same way if everyone literally * had to * pick one company 's bundle or another 's . 
  yet that is what we get with government . 
  talk about a sidenote !, 
  oh well , i suppose blabbering is what reddit is for . 
   first of all , try not to overemphasize the significance of the eu . 
  yes , we 're eu members , and in the same vein we 're nato members , un members , imf members . 
  * exactly * the same vein ? 
  what 's an allotment ? 
  fine,
