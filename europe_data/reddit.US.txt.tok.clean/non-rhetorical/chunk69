  yeah , i do . 
  if i wanted to make the debate easy on myself , i 'd point out that you 're ignoring the pacific like you guys always do . 
  but i think our help was also needed for the european theatre . 
  churchill begged the us to get involved for a reason . 
  `` we could have done it ourselves '' is a total fantasy on the part of europeans . 
  your grandfathers would disagree . 
   japan was , and still is , restricted by treaties so was weimar . 
   ( and occupied ) aaaa ha !, 
   but the cold war is over thanks to iceland , as we all know . 
   we can avoid the one we are at the brink of entering if the us will stop playing police says you . 
  `` go ahead , let them have the sudetenland . '', 
  i 'm familiar with the theory . 
  imo , it relies too heavily on the notion that vain , prideful leaders will act ` rationally ' in the economic sense . 
  the eu was a possibility because europe had had 50 years of peace . 
  if ww2 was an aftershock of ww1 , then why did n't ww3 happen ? 
  why did n't germany and/or japan re-militarize ? 
  real talk : i think you 're being shortsighted . 
  there has n't been an armed conflict between two major powers in 70 years , and this is the way that 's been achieved . 
  if you do n't like it , fine , that 's your prerogative , but do n't expect us to come running to defend a position we had well-defended before you made us stop defending it . 
   the [ europeans ] kicking [ the us ] off [ the continent ] changes the status of the alliance . 
  that 's how to read that sentence . 
  i have already described how it changes the status of the alliance . 
  if you want to question one of the reasons provided , feel free to do so , but do n't ask me to repeat myself . 
   please get off our continent . 
  oh , i 'll give barack a call . 
  the kicking off changes the status of the alliance . 
  it ca n't not . 
  we are , in that circumstance , inherently less able to act to defend our allies . 
  if our allies choose that path , they 've made their priorities clear . 
  a point off to the side : collaboration is overrated -- `` design by committee '' is a slur for a reason . 
  everyone is better off , whether it 's a work project or a military action , when one person is firmly in the lead . 
  i would question the value of nato to the united states after being kicked out of the continent . 
   and it is not like we ca n't keep the russians out ourselves . 
  who does ` we ' refer to ? 
  all of europe ? 
  just the swedes and danes ? 
  new anti-separatist slogan : `` ca n't spell unicorn without union ! '', 
  i do like that . 
  someone 's wiki link in there lead me to this [ euler diagram of former soviet states ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/supranational_postsoviet_bodies-en.svg/400px-supranational_postsoviet_bodies-en.svg.png ) , which i also like . 
  so crisp . 
  ah , we arrive at the crux of the matter -- and the reason this wo n't work . 
  why , if you are germany , would you agree to those safeguards ? 
  california agreed in 1850 to political equality with rhode island . 
  i am not sure they would do that in 2016 . 
  you need a reason to unify beyond `` this is a good idea . '', 
  a catalyst event , like persians/redcoats/etc coming over the hill . 
  why not just pick latin ? 
  * a lot more people know it * a lot more people would be willing to learn it because it has other uses as well * a number of legal concepts have latin names * obvious linguistic reasons which i 'm noting nonetheless as a professional practitioner of artificial languages aka a programmer , the idea of doing a 10-trillion dollar rewrite in a purely academic language is something i frown upon . 
  yep . 
  i want it straight from the horse 's mouth . 
   denmark used to be on the peninsular . 
  ah , that 's what we 're arguing . 
  then why does it matter that the danes used to be there but not that the icelanders did ? 
  we 've already established the peninsula is irrelevant , otherwise denmark would n't be included and finland would . 
  it 's not like that . 
  icelanders are direct descendents of the norse with , allegedly , a little irish mixed in . 
   icelandic is a good chunk different than all the other north germanic languages . 
  i 'm willing to buy this as the reason , but i want to hear one of them say it . 
  it seems odd to me , given they all descend from old norse and icelandic is the closest not counting faroese . 
  thanks for your reply !, 
  this answers my peninsula questions , but not my iceland questions . 
  to be explicit : i understand excluding finland . 
  finno-hungarian language family . 
  very different . 
  but icelandic is linguistically related to the others , and icelanders are culturally related . 
  why do n't they qualify ? 
  i watched the video . 
  mr. grey gives no explanation as to why iceland is not included . 
  in fact , given his explicit criteria -- geographic , historical , and linguistic -- i feel iceland should absolutely be considered scandinavian . 
  iceland is n't scandinavian ? 
  why not ? 
  i understand they 're not on the peninsula , but neither is denmark . 
  what gives ? 
  no , i mean in threads like this . 
  also , dunno who steve is . 
  the only people i 've heard use the term are people from the uk . 
  all i 'm asking you to do is think about the process of polling . 
   b. creationism , that is , the idea that ** god created human beings pretty much in their present form ** at one time within the last 10,000 years that 's yhbc , not yec . 
   i 'm not sure what previous question someone would need to ask me , so i could give one of those two answers . 
  there 's more than one way to skin a cat . 
   b. creationism ,  that is , the idea that god created human beings  pretty much in their present form  at one time within the last 10,000 years these are verbal questions , not written ones . 
  your eye attracts you to the number ; the ear hears the first things first . 
  my grandmother would jump on creationism as soon as she heard the word . 
  but if you just asked her straight up , `` how old is the earth ? '', 
  she would n't pick a number in the thousands . 
   with 53 % answers `` god created man exactly how bible describes it '' . 
  great example of a jump-able answer option . 
  there are people who would pick that as soon as they heard it who also do n't believe 7 days literally meant 168 hours . 
   ** from the same poll ** 35 % says that `` science is in conflict with religion '' . 
  yep !, 
  you just got framed . 
  you 're associating the questions with each other because they appear next to each other and are from the same poll . 
  were they asked next to each other irl ? 
  might some percentage of respondents have heard the conflict question and thought , `` no , god is god . 
  he 's not earthly . 
  the two are n't in conflict . '' ? 
  keep in mind , too , that when a pollster says , `` does religion conflict with science '' people are going to hear , `` does your religion ... ? '', 
  or `` does the bible ... ? '', 
  and the 6,000 number is n't in the bible ; it was just inferred by some monk or other . 
  by catalog i mean the questions asked in succession , by the pollster to the respondent .
