  especially law & order : svu and ncis . 
  one would need a non-trivial understanding of the history of american immigration to get where it comes from . 
  deep enough to know certain things we teach in schools are n't true , and that the truth is politically incorrect . 
  nb : the strong tendency of non-americans to cite the same example is not an accident . 
  why ? 
  what did he ever do to you ? 
   decicious decisions ? 
  delicious seems less fitting ... unless you flip the ` and ' with the ` of ' . 
  thanks for explaining !, 
  hmm . 
  i had expected , if we were going to talk about two similarly-named saxon relatives arriving on the shores of the british isles in the 5th century , it was going to be hengist and horsa . 
  shows what i know . 
  ohh , i misread what you were saying . 
  i thought you meant germany focused on the war to the exclusion of everything else . 
  my head is a little fuzzy today !, 
  tbh , i do n't remember what our regular history classes covered . 
  the vast majority of what i know about german history , i learned in german classes in high school ( [ we read this thing in german 3 i think ] ( http://www.amazon.com/die-weisse-rose-inge-scholl/dp/8711090596 ) ) and college . 
  if we did n't cover hitler 's rise to power ( which we probably did n't ) , that would seem wrong . 
  ** edit . 
  ** we did watch the wave once , actually . 
  but that 's all i recall . 
   he shows how much of a maniac the guy was ahh , i can see the point in that case . 
  my bad . 
   are n't covered nearly as detailed compared to how other countries in europe cover those topics ? 
  let me ask you a random question . 
  a bbc podcast recently covered immigrants in germany . 
  they said there 's this ( turkish ? ), 
  comedian who reads excerpts from mein kampf in public . 
  do you know who i 'm talking about ? 
  is he well known ? 
  i could n't believe that when i heard it . 
  what an asshole . 
   they fought over okinawa many times ** for some reason ** and there was some business on iwo jima . 
  [ take a guess ] ( https://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/national_parks/pacific_theater_1941_45.jpg )  pyrrhic victory . 
  http://i.imgur.com/p2ouh68.jpg battles can be pyrrhic victories , because they lead to you losing the war . 
  that 's just what that means , man . 
  but even if you extend the term to cover wars , it still does n't make sense . 
  the one side needs to lose some massive number of people . 
  [ japan lost 3.5 to 4.5 % of its population ; the us lost 0.32 % . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties ) in both of the battles you note , the casualty ratio favors the us massively . 
  what are you on about , m8 ? 
   fear-mongering about the possibility of falling down the social latter surely drove the middle class into the nsdap 's arms . 
  you 've lost me already !, 
   coupled with classical ideas of `` biedermeier '' ( conservative ideas about family , as well as seeking refuge in the private life ) the national socialists used ( classical gender roles ) must 've surely resonated with the otherwise weary , conservative crowd . 
  ah yes . 
  the party propaganda depicted women exclusively as wives or mothers , iirc . 
  interesting . 
  does the junker class tie into the explanation as well , or no ? 
  how would you ask it ? 
  hey , we cover the magna carta . 
  it 's presented as the early ancestor to our own system . 
  we also cover the ir -- with full recognition that it began in england , if it needs to be said . 
  and some of the empire . 
  india was the crown jewel , yada yada . 
    tl ; dr tbh , i am truly puzzled as to why everyone feels the need to note that . 
  indeed , that fact is the basis of the question . 
  well i am surprised . 
  if you ever get a hankering , give this audiobook shot : https://kat.cr/tms-the-norsemen-understanding-vikings-and-their-culture-michael-d-c-drout-t11538740.html it 's really good !, 
  where are you from , minnesota ? 
  wisconsin ? 
  michigan ? 
  if it 's not one of those three , i 'll be surprised . 
  frankfurt is in a state called hesse , which is also the origin of king george 's mercenaries , the hessians . 
  red-walker , dead-walker ; green-walker , live longer . 
  but it rhymes in german , obviously . 
  jeez . 
  makes you wonder if a certain opponent is in mind . 
  q : where can one find more films like becket and the lion in winter ? 
   the us is coming to norway like , right now ? 
  you ever been to / r/russia ? 
  the header comes off like satire . 
  you could do that , or you could learn russian . 
  i recall eric schmidt saying their internet is `` extremely insular , '' comparatively . 
  point being , yes , * you * the individual may have little choice , but whole peoples make a collective decision , as they do with so many other things , as to how much influence they want to accept . 
   well , i would say that you actually can market farts . 
  but that 's not the point . 
  until paris has an nfl team , it 's at least a little bit the point . 
  it 's of course possible to make people buy things they do n't really want , but that power is finite . 
  the blame is not a 100/0 split . 
  yeah , but there are limits ; you ca n't market farts . 
  and it 's not like everyone else is `` above '' marketing . 
  i do n't understand the edit . 
  the point of my original post was to call into question the poisoning metaphor on the grounds that the murdered person is not complicit in his own poisoning . 
  you seem to have understood that in the first para . 
  what gives ? 
  it 's such a nice looking flag . 
  much nicer than those boring , old tri-colors the continentals go in for . 
  really !, 
  at this point i 'm wondering if there are more union jacks in the us than in the uk . 
  ( 99 % of them hanging on the bedroom walls of teenagers who just started listening to punk , of course . ), 
  the recipient of poisoning is not a voluntary participant ; the importer is . 
  i take no issue with the other five . 
  eh , `` lots '' is a strong word . 
  in a neighborhood of 100 houses , you might see 2-5 . 
  calm down , dude . 
  we 're talking about doors . 
  doors . 
  i think i get the gist . 
  in a small way , it reminds me of northern virginia ( which thinks of itself as an extension of washington , dc ) vs. southern virginia . 
  nova funds 75 % of the state government yet receives 25 % of its expenditures .
