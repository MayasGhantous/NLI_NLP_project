  nobody gets switzerland as a full member . 
  more of a guiding principle than a rule , but whatev . 
  note : this is not , not , not a political debate thread . 
  topic ideas : * demographics * political talking points , big and small * perhaps geography or language, 
  #bonus points for being harder for outsiders to guess , while still conforming to the rule that `` everyone '' from your country should know what the year denotes , sans context . 
  reality tv stars who manage to stay in the headlines year after year , etc. 
  could be anyone , though . 
  #bonus points if no one outside your country has ever heard of them . 
  video links preferred !, 
  cast aside your embarrassment and show us your trash tv gossip . 
  what 's your go-to ? 
  #feel free to throw in magnet links , if you feel like it ... 
  see : / r/celticunion it 's not my intent to belittle the idea . 
  just curious whether those of you in relevant areas have heard of it and what your thoughts might be . 
  no iceland . 
  iceland stay away . 
  say a website , if you need a hypothetical . 
  like lol , lmao , etc, 
  ( meaning putin 's government , not the russian people . ), 
  give me an opinion you hold which very , very few of your countrymen do . 
  i tend to believe leadership could have avoided this outcome but did n't take the threat seriously . 
  at time of writing , it is 3:45 gmt . 
  thank you, 
  #meaning the real deal , not leave voters . 
  people who actually self-identify as nazis . 
  submit an application for your team !, 
  * business . 
  does the city/country have the necessary population/wealth/hockey interest to support a team ? 
  * competitiveness . 
  will you rely mostly on local talent , or will you import players from abroad ? 
  * aesthetic . 
  cool name !, 
  sweet uniforms !, 
  tell us what you have in mind . 
  * stadium . 
  do you have a local ice hockey stadium you can use ? 
  will you need to convert a soccer stadium ? 
  or build something new ? 
  * rivalries . 
  draw in fans . 
  who are your natural rivals ? 
  meaning no churchill . 
  unless it 's pre-ww2 churchill . 
  then it 's technically okay . 
  `` nazi gold '' is famous at this point , but i have just today learned from / u/xvoxnihili that the romanian government entrusted the ussr with their state treasury , yet the treasury never made its way back to romania :  our treasury was sent to russia in wwi for safekeeping . 
  they 've never returned it to us . 
  we 're talking 120 tones of gold plus valuable objects . 
  did something similar happen in your country ? 
  ( privately-owned items are okay , too , if they are especially important artifacts . ), 
  -- please , go into detail on valuable objects of high cultural worth . 
  each story is special and unique when it comes to these historical artifacts , which is what makes it especially sad that they are lost . 
  when the movie came out , i was in college . 
  i remember going to a german club meeting with a female friend of mine . 
  we spoke with four international students from germany about the movie . 
  the three male students loved it , thought it was kick-ass . 
  they especially liked hugo stiglitz , which makes sense . 
  after they walked away , the female german leaned in and said to us , `` did n't you feel like ... you * had to * like it ? '', 
  my friend and i looked at each other quizzically , then turned back and gave a simultaneous `` no ... '' she ( the german ) quickly changed the subject . 
  so i am curious . 
  what did you , europeans of / r/askeurope , think of `` inglourious basterds '' ? 
  were there any small things you caught that you found interesting ? 
  was ig a simple shoot-em-up , or was there a message to the movie ? 
  if so , what was it ? 
  what did it contemplate ? 
  for example , perhaps german-speakers feel that mandatory capitalization of `` nouns '' would make code more readable . 
  thoughts ? 
  i do n't know how much to expect from this question . 
  hopefully people get my meaning . 
  using the us as an example . 
  as a person : * [ uncle sam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uncle_sam ) is the most famous .

  very clever . 
  nuance : he technically represents the us government , whereas ... * [ columbia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/columbia_\\ ( name \\ ) ) represents the people .

  pick whatever blunder comes to mind . 
  does n't have to be `` the worst . '', 
  detail the situation at the time . 
  whose fault was the blunder ? 
  what was the immediate effect ? 
  what was the long-term effect ? 
  if so , * what exactly do they say ? 
  especially pertaining to your country/region 's situation . 
  * links pls . 
  language irrelevant -- i 'll google translate my way through it . 
  we do n't learn about them in school here . 
  everything i know is from the internet . 
  would anyone care to pick one or two examples and explain what makes those examples noteworthy/interesting ? 
  have you ever seen a bog body up close ?
