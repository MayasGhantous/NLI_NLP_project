  was it eery ? 
  -- ( firefox says ` eery ' is not a word . 
  get your shit together , firefox . 
  children know that word . ), 
  also , do you skip certain eras ? 
  some germans use ` we ' for wwi but not wwii . 
  usually the germans do quotations like , , , i am a quotation ! '', 
  other times , especially in novels , `` they do quotations with these thingies . '' so , questions : 1 . 
  what do you use for quotations ? 
  are there other punctuation differences you know of ? 
  * brits are welcome to respond to top-level comments , but please avoid posting one . 
  ( yes , this is an odd request , but the continentals will simply defer to brits out of politeness otherwise . 
  i want to hear what they have to say . ), 
  or is this all hot air ? 
  * keep it civil , bitte . 
  * no google/wikipedia . 
  what do ** you ** believe it means ? 
  interpret as you will . 
  are you an eastern european ? 
  up to you . 
  i think - cz is the most popular by far . 
  you also see - pl and - fr , but - cz is # 1 . 
  in the u.s. , our `` big three '' sports ( am . 
  football , baseball , basketball ) have very little prominent international competition . 
  ( yes , basketball is in the olympics , but outside of that one time shaq and kobe were lazy assholes , the gold medal is a foregone conclusion . ), 
  ( no offense , argentina . 
  no one can take 2004 away from you . ), 
  -- how much news do you consume about the one vs the other ? 
  outside of the world cup and the euro , do you watch your national team , or no ? 
  what is it like in terms of hoping for success ? 
  what is your `` relationship '' with players on your club 's team vs on the national team ? 
  ( professional players come and go , etc. ), 
  i first heard of them on a bbc podcast a month ago . 
  opinion seems quite divided , the way bbc tells it . 
  dotcoms , apps , whatever . 
  should be consumer-facing , though , not a b2b . 
  give us a replay of the day 's events as they unfolded , from your perspective . 
  example : the mongols ' non-conquering of europe , which easily might have happened without their infamous infighting caused by problems of succession . 
  inspired by dan carlin 's hardcore history . 
  * the two politicians must be in the same country . 
  * they can be in different parties , though . 
  using the us as an example , 1 . 
  pass the house of representatives with  50 % . 
  there are 435 reps. 2 . 
  pass the senate with  50 % . 
  there are 100 senators . 
  if there is a tie , the vp breaks the tie . 
  fun fact : this is the vp 's sole constitutional power ( unless the president dies , but then he 's not vp any more ) . 
  if the president signs , the bill becomes a law . 
  however , if the president vetoes , the bill goes back to the senate . 
  if 2/3 of the senate votes yea , the bill becomes a law . 
  this is pretty rare . 
  i suppose the above will sound like an asshole question if you 're ukrainian . 
  i apologize for that . 
  how have things changed in the last 5-10 years ? 
  where will things be 5-10 years from now ? 
  discussion suggestions : * your own perspective * how the media/politicians discuss the topic * how the people around you discuss the topic, 
  * if your guy is so famous everyone will already have heard of him ( e.g. , leonardo da vinci ) , tell a lesser-known anecdote about him , so we can learn something new . 
  * no linking wikipedia . 
  is boring . 
  generate conversation .

  how often do you look up words when reading ? 
  when writing ? 
  uk contributions to security might be an item :  [ `` if you look at something like europol , we are the largest contributor to europol . 
  so if we left europol , then we would take our information -- this is in the legislation -- with us . 
  the fact is , the european partners want us to keep our information there , because we keep other european countries safe as well , '' rudd said . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/brexit-eu-condemns-mays-blackmail-over-security-cooperation ) how exhaustive a list can we make ? 
  what is conceivably on the table ? 
  using the us as an example , from the 1900 onward , we have had ** 21 ** presidents including the new one . 
  of those 21 , the immediate previous political positions are totaled below : * 7 state governors * 6 vps ( 2 elected , 4 unelected ) * 3 us senators * 2 cabinet members ( secretary of commerce , war ) * 1 nato supreme commander * 1 ... no political/military experience * 0 us congressmen as you can see , if you want to be president , you should first become governor of a state ( and the bigger the state , the better ) . 
  alternatively , you can become vp and hope the president dies . 
  those are the two most common routes , 1900-present . 
  example : prettiest trams . 
  * if you can search on the internet and find a ranking , it 's not trivial enough . 
  to clarify , you may nominate one actor and one actress . 
  no lists . 
  i will beseech the gods to smite you . 
  i have my doubts , but i am willing to be persuaded . 
  concerns : 1 . 
  can it be greater than the sum of its parts , militarily ? 
  i 'm not sure the pro of reduced redundancies outweighs the con of integration friction . 
  frankly , how willing are soldiers to die for a supranational political union ? 
  relationship with nato . 
  austria , sweden , finland , ireland , cyprus , and malta are in the eu but not nato . 
  without the uk , the eu has one `` major '' military power , france . 
  [ given france 's favorability ratings of the eu ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/06/07/euroskepticism-beyond-brexit/pm_2016-06-07_brexit-01/ ) ( lower than anyone but greece ) , this seems like a problem . 
  without the uk , the eu has one nuclear power , france . 
  do we expect france to sign over its nuclear capability to the eu , or do they retain sole control over it ? 
  * ** one means one . 
  ** examples : * * agency/ies : * british intelligence ( gchq , mi5 , mi6 ) * * institution : * the swiss canton system * * approach : * portuguese drug law, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_rail_of_politics edit . 
  the metaphor here is that if you touch the third rail , you die . 
  the third rail has electric current running through it . 
  -- broadly , there are two ways to use the term . 
  the second is more interesting . 
  a political ** stance ** that super unpopular . 
  some people are pro-choice , some are pro-life , but very few pro-life politicians would go so far as to come out against abortion rights for rape victims . 
  a political ** issue ** which has only unpalatable solutions . 
  how to reduce the national debt , for example .
