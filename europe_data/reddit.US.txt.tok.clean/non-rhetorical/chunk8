  married men with fat , ugly pigs for wives , who nonetheless either love their wives very much or are worried about the legal implications of cheating on their spouses re : divorce settlements . 
  brilliant . 
  buy buy buy !, 
  * you are now a moderator of / r/catwoman . 
  yeah , but then you have to find room in your house for a sex doll . 
  and you have to , like , clean it and put it away . 
  if i 'm going to fuck a sex doll , i would prefer not to have to look at it terribly long afterward . 
  point being , you 're paying for more than just the fake sex . 
  possibly * the new republic * , aka tnr , although it has gone way downhill since it was sold in 2014 . 
  ` mistake ' is a bit strong . 
  i think it 's just breaking down under the weight of gamesmanship . 
  you have a situation where the various sub-groups within the un are often headed by `` ironic '' choices of leadership . 
  for example , the human rights council just held an election for 14 seats of its total 47 . 
  [ here are the results . 
  ] ( http://www.un.org/press/en/2016/ga11848.doc.htm ) saudi arabia . 
  china . 
  russia just barely , barely lost to croatia for the second eastern european seat , 112 to 114 . 
  are you serious ? 
  link/source/convincing explanation ? 
  are you , like , unfamiliar with the concept of press credentials ? 
  it 's not a legal right , and they are by their nature selective . 
  gross . 
  deep . 
   `` you look at the european union , and it 's germany . 
  basically a vehicle for germany . '', 
  people on this board say the same thing every fucking day . 
  interesting theory . 
   for his supporters it sounds like `` swedistan boys , gon na get these motherfuckers some freedom soon '' . 
  more like , `` here is a cautionary tale . 
  this is additional evidence for banning muslims . '', 
   at the end of the day sweden is a safer place to live than the us . 
  real talk , that 's irrelevant . 
  we do n't face a choice between being the us and being sweden . 
  we face a choice between accepting refugees or not . 
  are you having trouble with the english , or the idea of re-integrating isis soldiers into swedish society ? 
  i can only help with the english . 
  to be president-elect , you would need to have been * elected * . 
  fox news was pretty vocally anti-trump throughout the primaries , fwiw . 
  like the other guy said , it 's an american term . 
  it refers to white people leaving an area . 
  in the us , increased crime in the cities led to a `` white flight '' to the suburbs . 
  certainly looks nicer than toledo , ohio . 
  that 's an interesting story . 
  i totally believe it , too . 
  really , i could see it going either way . 
  the chimp has a lot more fighting experience , especially of the to-the-death variety . 
  hafthor is just so big , though . 
  he 's literally 70 % taller and 112 % heavier . 
  if i were hafthor , i would try and wrap the chimp up from behind , get your arms around his neck , and break it . 
  but this is n't mma . 
  the chimp is going to bite you , claw at you , use his 1.8-meter wingspan to grab at your face when you 're behind him . 
  of course a gorilla wins . 
  that 's not even worth discussing . 
  the chimp question is simply intriguing . 
  chimps are fast -- a lot faster than hafthor . 
  situation : hafthor is dropped into the jungle . 
  he mistakenly insults an alpha male chimpanzee via some body language/facial expression that has cultural meaning to them . 
  alpha chimp attacks . 
  hafthor is an animal lover , so he tries to run away , but in doing so , they both stumble and fall into a large pit -- possibly a trap set by poachers . 
  the pit is 20 feet high . 
  hafthor tries to climb out , but the chimp drags him back in , reaching his long chimpy fingers for hafthor 's eye sockets . 
  it 's do-or-die time . 
  what happens ? 
  really , you think so ? 
  in conversation , i am always one to point out how strong chimpanzees are , but i think a man that size a ) definitely would n't get `` destroyed '' and b ) might actually win . 
  it would be an interesting fight . 
  also , from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chimpanzee#muscle_strength  chimpanzees [ dubious -- discuss ] are known for possessing great amount of muscle strength , especially in their arms . 
  however , compared to humans the amount of strength reported in media and popular science is greatly exaggerated with numbers of four to eight times the muscle strength of a human . 
  these numbers stem from two studies in 1923 and 1926 by a biologist named john bauman . 
  [ 30 ] [ 31 ] these studies were refuted in 1943 and an adult male chimp was found to pull about the same weight as an adult man . 
  [ 32 ] corrected for their smaller body sizes , chimpanzees were found to be stronger than humans but not anywhere near four to eight times . 
  in the 1960s these tests were repeated and chimpanzees were found to have twice the strength of a human when it came to pulling weights . 
  the reason for the higher strength seen in chimpanzees compared to humans are thought to come from longer skeletal muscle fibers that can generate twice the work output over a wider range of motion compared to skeletal muscle fibers in humans . 
  size :  the male common chimp stands ** up to ** 1.2 m ( 3.9 ft ) high and weighs ** as much as ** 91 kg ( 201 lb ) ; the female is somewhat smaller . 
  [ citation needed ] x-factor :  when extended , the common chimp 's long arms span one and a half times the body 's height . 
  [ 23 ] hafthor is 6 ' 9 '' / 423 lbs . 
  in a fight , size is worth an awful lot . 
  if we 're talking about a wild chimp whose seen a lot of fights in his day , okay , but if we 're talking about a chimp raised in captivity , give me hafthor . 
   while 44 % of the uks exports are going to eu countries , only 8-17 % of uk exports are going to eu countries wat, 
  you could interpret it either way , really . 
  `` of eu countries '' would be less ambiguous . 
  it 's not an error , per se , though . 
  mcgregor also has more fighting technique than a gorilla , does n't mean he would win against one . 
  did you watch the video ? 
  yes , they 're play-fighting , but nothing i 'm seeing makes me think mcgregor would win . 
  the most interesting thing on here is that every country names itself most compassionate , but not because they grant themselves every superlative . 
  just that one . 
  i can never remember what any of these words mean , but i still laugh every time . 
   we had a proposal to tell people that if there were more than 30 % immigrants in an area , they could n't live there ` people ' meaning immigrants ? 
  i.e. , the percentage of immigrants should not rise above 30 % ? 
  i think he understands the importance of having friends . 
  in a sentence , his campaign strategy was to make as many friends * as possible , even if the price per friend was turning 10 people who were n't going to vote for him into 10 people who hate his guts . 
  * in swing states, 
  there is a sub for finding subs , but i can never remember what it 's called . 
  i believe they call that ` irony . ', 
  no way . 
  he needs the credibility of trotting out there with may . 
  i 'm a white american , and i feel the exact same way . 
  i understand why the euros are put off by it , but i also think their strong opinions are based in the fact that for them the matter is abstract . 
   you have to understand our relationship with the state is totally different than that of the mainland continent .
