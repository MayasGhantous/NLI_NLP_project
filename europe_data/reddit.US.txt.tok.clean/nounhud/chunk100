   we had this unique chance to show the world and europe that we are going forward with times , but we blew it . 
  we are still stuck in 20th century and with that mentality we are going to stay there for a long time . 
  if it makes you feel better , my chance of remembering this tomorrow is pretty much zilch .

   call out the people who call european federalism a bad thing ... americans . 
  huh ? 
  i 'm do n't particularly think that european federalism is a bad thing . 
  i am almost certain that there is n't any real strong feelings one way or the other in the us . 
  maybe slightly `` being a big federation is normal here , so that might be better '' . 
   it 's clearly not democratic to press an issue the establishment want to pass until it passes . 
  of course , the flip side is that maybe the fact that votes can vary from run to run means that the voting process is n't democratic . 
   the treaties signed upon joining do n't mention anything about cutting funding if we refuse ... 
  regardless of the merits of distributing immigrants in europe , there 's a broader eu level issue here -- the fact that the [ power of the purse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/power_of_the_purse ) often can step outside of well-defined limits on power . 
  the us has crashed face-first into this , and the eu also has to address the same issue , one way or another . 
  the us federal government effectively overrode some powers reserved to the state governments by ( a ) taxing the population and then ( b ) not providing federal dollars back unless the state did what the federal government wanted . 
  for example , one one case where the us federal government effectively usurped state government powers : * state governments are responsible for building infrastructure , like roads . 
  however , the federal government wanted an interstate highway system . 
  instead of having state governments agree between themselves on the system or passing a constitutional amendment to grant the federal government power over highway systems , the government proposed a `` military '' system for transporting tanks from coast to coast -- the [ dwight d. eisenhower national system of interstate and defense highways ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interstate_highway_system ) . 
  it treated this as dual-use -- something that could * also * be used by civilians when not moving tanks . 
  of course , in practice , this was simply a dodge around a restriction on power , and the interstate system in the us has never really been anything other than a civilian system . 
  * after this , since the federal government had the authority to tax people to fund the highway system and had complete leeway to direct funds related to highway construction and maintenance , it had some political influence over the state governments . 
  a group of activists wanted to raise the minimum drinking age in the us to 21 ; however , they had no power to do so . 
  some states agreed with this policy , but others disagreed with the policy , and these activists wanted to force the policy through across the entire country , including in states with disagreed . 
  as a result , the [ national minimum drinking age act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_minimum_drinking_age_act ) made use of the above power to direct highway funds -- it simply told states that it would continue to tax their residents , but not direct a portion of the federal highway funds to their highways unless they passed a law setting their minimum drinking age to the 21 years that the federal government wanted . 
  there 's a real question that the eu will also face as brussels gains power over time -- if you do not want a federal government to overstep its authority , how do you effectively constrain that power of the purse ? 
  i 've often thought that a us constitutional amendment that prohibits non-revenue-neutral taxation/spending contingent upon state power actions might be viable ( the judicial system would then need to interpret its application to many , many different cases ) might be a good idea , though i do not know whether it is practical -- it would affect many things .

      i do n't understand people who casually drink stuff over 80 proof . 
        just because you do n't enjoy something does n't mean others do n't . 
      oh i do n't disagree . 
  i just personally do n't understand it . 
    you 've never had a glass of wine or champagne at a restaurant to go along with your meal ? 
  over-80-proof wine ? 
   i also think this is evidenced by the number of terms we gave for getting drunk . 
    pissed , smashed , shit faced , fucked up etc. 
  `` pissed '' is british slang , though . 
   people have a right to know if weapons-grade uranium is being transported in their communities .

  first , i was n't aware that buildings could have [ diplomatic immunity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diplomatic_immunity ) . 
  second , while reading that article ... that sounds like a clusterfuck waiting to happen , since as far as i can tell , diplomats spend much of their time gleefully not paying bills :  in particular , new york city , the home of the united nations headquarters , regularly protests to the united states department of state about non-payment of parking tickets because of diplomatic status . 
  as of 2001 , the city had more than 200,000 outstanding parking tickets from diplomats , totaling more than $ 21.3 million , of which only $ 160,682 had been collected . 
  [ 24 ] in 1997 , then-mayor rudy giuliani proposed to the clinton administration that the u.s. state department revoke the special dpl plates for diplomats who ignore parking summonses ; the state department denied giuliani 's request . 
  [ 24 ]   in cities that impose a congestion charge , the decision of some diplomatic missions not to furnish payment has proved controversial . 
  in london , embassies have amassed approximately # 58 million in unpaid charges as of 2012 , with the american embassy comprising approximately # 6 million and the russian , german and japanese missions around # 2 million each . 
   apparently you could use `` clay '' like we use `` soil '' or `` land '' . 
  just on polandball . 
  the countryballs there speak a sort of mangled english in which `` clay '' may mean `` land '' . 
  it 's not normally correct in english to do this . 
  there are a number of other conventions there , like writing `` you '' as `` yuo '' and using phrases like `` poland can not into space '' instead of `` poland can not go to space '' .

  passive tags are only really useful for tracking at chokepoints like doorways , but can be used . 
  http://www.rfidjournal.com/blogs/experts/entry?10684  typically , passive low-frequency ( lf ) and high-frequency ( hf ) tags have a read range of up to 3 feet , while a simple passive ultrahigh-frequency ( uhf ) transponder can be read from 15 to 20 feet in free air ( that is , with the tag not on an object ) . 
  http://www.intensecomp.com.sg/wp_people_tracking.html  vicinity tag   tracking via vicinity tag enables tracking of a person from a distance . 
  the card/tag holder may not necessary to be aware that he/she is being monitored . 
  the reason is because readers or detectors are placed on a distance from the user . 
  for example , readers are placed 1 meter above walkway of a corridor . 
  the reader may not be visible to the user and yet the detection range can detect the tag carried by the user . 
    it is also possible to make a gantry with readers for users to pass through . 
  when the user passed through the gantry , the system will identify the user as well as record the time he/she passed the gantry or possible to use mat antenna such as a5530 .

  you have almost all the approximate regions right , but a handful of the precise locations off .

  i personally suspect that us policy on russia in europe is primarily determined by the bureaucracy rather than the us president 's personal whims , and that trump probably does n't even have access to that information at the moment ( and ditto for the other candidates ) .
