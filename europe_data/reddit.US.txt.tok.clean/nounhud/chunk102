  periphery transit countries are those like greece and italy . 
  they suffer from the problem that there is a constant flood of illegal immigration past their borders from a source country to which ptc countries can not deport illegal immigrants . 
  this is the important difference from tc countries -- closing borders is not an option . 
  thus , for ptc countries , it is important to either prevent migration across their border in the first place , or to permit redistribution : for them , pausing schengen is not much of a solution . 
  like tc countries , these do not want to register migrants , since it only worsens their own problems . 
  * uninvolved countries ( uc ) . 
  my guess is that perhaps portugal might qualify -- it probably does n't see a great deal of transit or a great deal of people trying to wind up in its borders . 
  for uc countries , the major short-term concern is mostly not having large amounts of redistributed migrants show up . 
  some ( romania , perhaps ) , are perhaps concerns about becoming tc countries if other countries close borders and redirect traffic through them . 
  a solution should address the major concerns of the above classes for the existing migrant crisis , and it should address the future migrant problems . 
  if some members lose out , at least they should benefit in some other ways sufficiently for them to be on-the-net happy . 
  ** dc ** : wants : redistribution of existing migrants , something that prevents future inflow into schengen . 
  dislikes : anything that permits inflow into schengen and free movement . 
  ** dcla ** : wants : the status quo is fine . 
  dislikes : anything that permits free movement into itself from schengen , any redistribution of migrants to itself . 
  ** tc ** : wants : the status quo is all right , though it 'd be nice to avoid flow through themselves if possible . 
  dislikes : any risk that it would be left `` holding the bag '' if the next country downstream closes its borders without it being able to close its borders . 
  any system that will disproportionately-redistribute refugees to it ( as a mandatory registration system would do ) . 
  ** ptc ** : wants : the schengen exterior borders reliably closed in such a way that migrants do n't even wind up at it , since deportation is n't an option . 
  redistribution . 
  dislikes : interior schengen borders closing , mandatory registration schemes . 
  ** uc ** : wants : the status quo is fine . 
  dislikes : any changes to migrant traffic that would make it a dc . 
  redistribution of migrants to itself . 
  * redistributing people out of the eu to a willing third party * would solve a lot of these , though it would need to be funded : if the destination were less-desirable than the eu dc , it would discourage future migration in the first place in addition to addressing existing numbers . 
  the downside is the obvious expense . 
  if payment per-head goes out , this is the australian approach . 
  * having turkey block emigration sounds similar * , but suffers from bad incentives : turkey is not compensated on a per-head basis that it retains on a level that would make it willingly retain anyone , so it has an incentive to make an appearance of retaining people , not to actually retain people . 
  additionally , offering turkey eu membership ( which would move residents of turkey into the eu ) in exchange for holding many people who the eu does not want seems like an offer without much credibility . 
  * redistribution within the eu * does little to address the long-term issue . 
  to the extent that it moves people to a dcla , it may actually encourage illegal immigration . 
  if many people go to an undesirable eu member * and * can be compelled to remain there ( which schengen makes difficult ) , it might be possible to discourage some migration in the short term or reduce costs ( since welfare costs are tied to welfare levels for citizens in a country ) , but that will not apply work in the long term -- part of the point of the eu is to bring poorer members up to speed with wealthier members , and so ideally there wo n't * be * undesirable-in-the-eu places to put people . 
  additionally , no country wants to take any substantial number of migrants . 
  and there are very real issues of whether-or-not schengen would actually permit redistribution within the eu . 
  * sending migrants to guarded refugee camps in the eu * is an option that addresses many concerns , but it at best stretches the refugee convention and at worst violates it , since anyone granted asylum must also be given freedom of movement and work within the country to conform to that convention : one could perhaps `` stretch '' the evaluation time for asylum to extend this time . 
  additionally , i doubt that it is cheaper than having a third party country do the same hosting . 
  for all of the above , there are costs : while dcs may be willing to pay , they may not want to foot the entire bill . 
  i think that naryshkin was doing better when he was running the [ presidential commission of the russian federation to counter attempts to falsify history to the detriment of russia 's interests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidential_commission_of_the_russian_federation_to_counter_attempts_to_falsify_history_to_the_detriment_of_russia's_interests ) than running the duma . 
   `` first of all , it is needed to expel the us from the organization , '' naryshkin said nato members ca n't be unwillingly expelled from nato even if this were a goal ; his ordering is wrong . 
  you 'd have to dissolve nato by having everyone else withdraw . 
  naryshkin did not do his homework on the rules . 
   dude even with your ridiculous understanding that if ussr supported something it is automatically ok for us to invade i did n't say that . 
  does n't mean i * disagree * with it either , but i was responding to an earlier point :   like 99 % of every coup america did was because of actions from the ussr or china you claimed that this was not the case :  lol . 
  i do n't think that even americans believe this shit . 
  i was indicating whether the soviet union or china were involved in some of these . 
  according to the internet , different root words . 
  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=believe  old english belyfan `` to believe , '' earlier geleafa ( mercian ) , gelefa ( northumbrian ) , gelyfan ( west saxon ) `` believe , '' from proto-germanic * ga-laubjan `` to believe , '' perhaps literally `` hold dear , love '' ( cognates : old saxon gilobian `` believe , '' dutch geloven , old high german gilouben , german glauben ) , ultimately a compound based on pie * leubh - `` to care , desire , love '' ( see belief ) . 
  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lie  `` speak falsely , tell an untruth , '' late 12c. , from old english legan , ligan , earlier leogan `` deceive , belie , betray '' ( class ii strong verb ; past tense leag , past participle logen ) , from proto-germanic * leugan ( cognates : old norse ljuga , danish lyve , old frisian liaga , old saxon and old high german liogan , german l\u00fcgen , gothic liugan ) , from pie root * leugh - `` to tell a lie . '', 
  `` murder '' is a specific crime , not `` kill when i do n't like it '' . 
  russian soldiers almost certainly did not murder the people on mh17 -- just killed them . 
  well , let 's check . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_invasions * [ 2003 invasion of iraq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_iraq ) . 
  * [ war in afghanistan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_afghanistan_%282001%e2%80%9314%29 ) : not a soviet or chinese origin . 
  afghanistan refused to extradite bin laden after 9/11 and was providing training camps for more attacks ; for most countries , an attack on their military headquarters and attempt to whack their legislature or executive is probably grounds for at least some pretty substantial action . 
  * [ haiti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_uphold_democracy ) . 
  democratically-elected government overthrown by military coup reinstated .

  * [ panama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_invasion_of_panama ) . 
  not soviet or chinese , though noriega regime was soviet-aligned . 
  initial dispute over drug smuggling and money laundering by regime turns into invasion after a noriega-backed candidate loses an election , remains in place after major vote fraud , and refuses to step down . 
  invasion is done over opposition of the un , not support ( and is thus not legal ) . 
  while the oas had condemned noriega for refusing to step down , it was also opposed to a us invasion in response .

  us action condemned by un . 
  * [ dominican republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominican_civil_war ) . 
  no soviet or chinese involvement .

  counter-invasion pushes into north korea before being forced back . 
  * world war ii : invasion of japanese-held islands . 
  japan attacks us first , though after us cuts off its oil supply for it invading china . 
  not in opposition to soviet union or china ; rather , in conjunction . 
  invasion of germany/italy-occupied europe . 
  * [ world war i : invasion of russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_intervention_in_the_russian_civil_war ) . 
  relatively-small ( compared to world war i as a whole ) military action supporting anti-bolshevik forces after bolshevik forces folded to germany . 
  * world war i : invasion of axis-held europe . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_involvement_in_regime_change already covered by the above invasions other than : * [ world war i-era occupation of dominican republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_occupation_of_the_dominican_republic_%281916%e2%80%9324%29 ) * [ 1953 iranian coup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d'%c3%a9tat ) .

  * [ libya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_libya ) . 
  providing support ( particularly suppression of air defenses ) for a primarily franco-british effort in support of anti-gaddafi rebels . 
  finally , there is no entry for [ syria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american-led_intervention_in_syria ) , but i 'd say that it should be on the list : supplies were provided to anti-assad forces , mingling with the isis conflict and and escalating to airstrikes . 
  looks like polandball is [ due for an update ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/3j04mj/special_forces ) . 
  i saw this article earlier , and it initially-confused me , as it initially sounds like more us combat aircraft are being moved in . 
  in fact , as the article reads , after the russian/turkish shootdown , turkey requested support from the us , and the us sent in two groups of usaf f-15s to do combat air patrols . 
  the conflict did not build into more shooting , and the f-15s are now coming back out . 
  some a-10s are remaining , but these are not particularly well-suited for air-to-air combat .
