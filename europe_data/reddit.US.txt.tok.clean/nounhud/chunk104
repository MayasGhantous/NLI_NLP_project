  is he equally prepared to have the agreement encompass the privatization of state-run institutions and reduce the degree of social services offered ? 
  to eliminate guaranteed vacation minimums ? 
  to terminate financial transaction taxes ? 
  to adopt at-will employment ? 
  because such an agreement seems unlikely to be a one-way road , and the author seems to think that unification of societies would be a marvelous tool to advocate for progressivism , but does n't seem to consider whether he personally would agree with policies not in his stable of favored ideas being spread by such a mechanism . 
  remember , as well , that the eu and the us also trade with other countries , like china , and asking china to adopt similar positions may be a rather-larger and more-difficult change . 
  it seems unlikely that either the eu or the us would want ttip to be incompatible with trade with those countries . 
  somewhere , mh17 lawsuit-pushing lawyers are going to have fun with this . 
  ... huh . 
  apparently at least some families are [ filing in us federal court ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/mh17-update-families-file-lawsuits-over-malaysia-flight-downed-during-ukraine-war-2137643 ) , of all places . 
   wisner filed a lawsuit in july in federal court in chicago on behalf of 18 mh17 families seeking damages of $ 50 million for each victim for a total of $ 900 million . 
  admittedly , the us legal system dearly loves its immense punitive damages , but i 'm not sure how the lawyers are going to sell the court on claiming that the court has jurisdiction ... the impression i got is that [ us courts have been tending away from permitting clearly-foreign lawsuits from showing up in us courts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libel_tourism#united_states ) . 
   because noone from ukraine will go poland or spain to immigrate or steal . 
  you mean due to per-capita wealth ? 
  it 's still not a fantastic fit : the [ uk is about as wealthy as france and wealthier than italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita ) . 
  not the governments , but i 'm left somewhat-surprised by the positions of various eu publics on ukranian eu membership . 
  looking at [ this graph ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2015/06/russia-ukraine-report-29.png ) from [ this page ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/1-nato-public-opinion-wary-of-russia-leary-of-action-on-ukraine/ ) : spain and poland are enthusiastic about ukranian eu membership . 
  the uk generally approves . 
  france , germany , and italy are opposed . 
  that does n't align with geographic position or amount of trade with russia well . 
  it does n't align well with the eu members who want close or less-close integration . 
  it does n't match up well with portion of the population with a slavic background . 
  it does n't match up well with degree of military power . 
  it does n't match up well with belief that nato would provide support in a conflict . 
  in fact , the only list i 've turned up that it correlates reasonably-well with is the [ degree of public concern that russia is a military threat to neighboring countries other than ukraine ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/nato-publics-blame-russia-for-ukrainian-crisis-but-reluctant-to-provide-military-aid/russia-ukraine-report-34/ ) . 
   that would n't happen with an `` eu gold membership '' , [ you already have gold memberships ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:supranational_european_bodies-en.png ) . 
  to say nothing of things like [ association agreements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_association_agreement ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_twenties  golden twenties or happy twenties is a term , mostly used in europe , to describe the 1920s , in which most of the continent had an economic boom following the first world war and the severe economic downturns that took place between 1919 -- 1923 , and before the wall street crash in 1929 . 
    it is often applied to germany ( goldene zwanziger ) , which enjoyed a healthy economic growth and a liberal , creative and experimental phase in society and arts . 
  [ 1 ] after the economic reforms of the weimar republic ended the extreme levels of inflation by the introduction of a new currency , the rentenmark , with tighter fiscal controls and reduction of bureaucracy , lead to a relative degree of political and economic stability . 
  before that period , the weimar republic had experienced record-breaking levels of inflation of one trillion percent between january 1919 and november 1923 . 
  the inflation was so severe that printed currency was often used for heating and other uses , and everyday requirements like food , soap , and electricity cost a wheelbarrow full of banknotes . 
  such events , among many other factors , triggered the rise of fascism in italy , as well as the ill-fated beer hall putsch , masterminded by a young adolf hitler . 
  i guess the early twenties in germany ... i still have a hard time calling the twenties a bad time . 
  i imagine that some of that translates into pressure on alaskan salmon production . 
  [ we produce a lot of salmon too , but this ranking ranked farmed salmon imported from norway more-highly on quality ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/farmed-vs-wild-salmon-can-you-taste-the-difference/2013/09/23/3a2650a2-1fcb-11e3-8459-657e0c72fec8_story.html ) than domestically-produced salmon . 
  the norwegian salmon was also the cheapest . 
   is there a single country in world history where the far-right was in power for a prolonged period of time that actually was good for the country ? 
  well ... it 's hard to say what `` far right '' would be . 
  if the `` far right '' became the mainstream , would you still call it the `` far right '' ? 
   [ far-right politics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/far-right_politics ) commonly include authoritarianism , anti-communism , and nativism . 
  i guess you could call the [ second red scare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mccarthyism ) in the us something like that . 
  whether or not you 'd like to see it again , [ the 1950s were certainly not a particularly horrible time for the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_in_the_1950s ) . 
  from having read your posts , i 'd guess that you 'd probably be opposed to imperialism , and [ right-wing anti-imperialism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-imperialism#right-wing_anti-imperialism ) encompassed nationalist movements and [ conflicts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wars_of_national_liberation ) that i suspect would be viewed in a positive light today . 
   it 's hard not to see parallels between the 1920s/30s and now the twenties were pretty good . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roaring_twenties  the roaring twenties is a term for the 1920s in the western world . 
  it was a period of sustained economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the united states , canada , and western europe , particularly in major cities such as new york , montreal , chicago , detroit , paris , berlin , london , and los angeles . 
  in france it was known as the `` ann\u00e9es folles '' ( `` crazy years '' ) , [ 1 ] emphasizing the era 's social , artistic and cultural dynamism . 
  normalcy returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism after world war i , jazz music blossomed , the flapper redefined modern womanhood and art deco peaked . 
  the era saw the large-scale use of automobiles , telephones , motion pictures , radio , electricity , refrigeration , air conditioning , unprecedented industrial growth , accelerated consumer demand and aspirations , plus significant changes in lifestyle and culture . 
  the media focused on celebrities , especially sports heroes and movie stars , as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums . 
  in most major countries women won the right to vote . 
  the thirties i could see being connected with `` economic crisis and political instability '' , but the twenties ? 
  i 'm enthusiastic about good electronic diagnosis systems in the long term . 
  search engines are n't great , but self-diagnosis with the right tools need not be . 
  the us disallows explicit medical claims from dietary supplements . 
  a lot of the post-war european structure was based around the idea of not having another nazi germany type situation . 
  the rationale russia has claimed , ethnic protection and reunification , is [ similar to hitler 's take on the sudetenland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suxoerkjcey ) . 
  if you consider another sudetenland unacceptable , and if that unacceptability is a core part of postwar european political ideals , then it becomes extremely difficult to accept crimea . 
  if russia had cut some deal with ukraine to keep crimea , that would have been one thing . 
  but to send in troops and cut off part of the country is another . 
  here , the mechanism is perhaps the most-important issue . 
  i suspect that there is a somewhat-disjoint collection of political groups doing so . 
  [ comparing the tsarist russian and soviet empires ] ( http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/600/comparing-the-tsarist-russian-and-soviet-empires ) . 
  some differences , some similarities . 
  i do n't think that you can claim that it was arbitrary very convincingly . 
  i think that we can all agree that most people would think it very strange for , say , estonia to be the successor nation to the ussr . 
   realistically , it 's highly unlikely that crimea will ever return to ukraine . 
  http://www.kas.de/upload/publikationen/panorama/2009/1/goertemaker.pdf  after the construction of the berlin wall on 13 august 1961 , [ german ] reunification was considered highly unlikely , if not impossible . 
  honestly , the us and russia already had relatively-little trade even before all this kicked off . 
  https://ustr.gov/russia  russia is currently our 23rd largest goods trading partner with $ 38.1 billion in total ( two way ) goods trade during 2013 . 
  [ the us mostly trades with the eu , china , japan , south korea , and the rest of north america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_united_states ) . 
  from russia 's standpoint , while the us [ was in the top 10 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_russia ) , the us was still below germany , china , ukraine , and even the netherlands . 
  poland 's economic voice alone is more than two-thirds as loud as the us 's in russia . 
  from an economic standpoint , russia cares a lot more about what the eu does than what the us does . 
   the sanctions hurt russia a lot harder than they hit europe , after all . 
  russia is a small trading partner of europe , but europe is a huge trading partner of russia . 
  it 's possible that russia chose the sanctions to try to place pressure on political weak points in the eu , where that pressure would do the most good , so it 's not just a `` reduce trade in total '' pressure . 
  my understanding is that russian-initiated sanctions were big on agricultural imports into russia , so presumably it would tend to swing farmers . 
  while i agree that in a simple `` let 's hit each other economically until someone gives in '' does not favor russia at all , it 's possible that there 's more to it than just that . 
  unless the eu somehow arranges for a grexit , i 'm pretty sure that simply cutting off greece from eu funds would have poor long-term effects . 
  there 's a problem . 
  it 's hard to do much without funds . 
  could they be used badly ? 
  sure , and that 's always a concern , anywhere . 
  greece is probably not very happy with how its leaders have spent its money . 
  maybe oversight gets attached if that 's a really big concern . 
  but `` greece permanently does n't get eu money '' is just silly . 
   especially after calls for mini schengen zones have already been made ? 
  hmm . 
  why could n't mini schengens be a transition to restoring schengen ? 
  i mean , it seems to make a lot of sense to me to say `` we 're cracking down on security ; as states re-secure themselves , we reopen borders '' ? 
  i do n't think that it 's true . 
  http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13649438.poll__scotland_faces_leaving_eu_despite_most_scots_wanting_to_stay/  the survation poll found 51 per cent of people across the uk would vote to leave if the referendum were held tomorrow , compared with 49 per cent who wanted to stay . 
    but in scotland the result was reversed , with 49 per cent saying they would vote to leave the eu and 51 per cent wanting to stay . 
  i 'd assume that `` separate from uk into eu '' would be substantially-less-popular than `` uk entirely out '' . 
  it seems extraordinarily-unlikely that it would be less than a percent of the population whose opinion would change depending upon whether it would be scotland breaking off of the uk or the uk as a whole leaving . 
   on the one hand a lot of people south of the border were clamoring for scotland to stay , on the other they were actively insulting the scots `` oh , they 'd never be able to successfully run their own country etc '' . 
  very strange . 
  us did it during the american civil war .
