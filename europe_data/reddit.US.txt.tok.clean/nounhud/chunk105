  not so strange . 
  you 're annoyed with region x , but you do n't want it to run off ( and some of that annoyance might be because it * is * looking like it might run off ) . 
  hell , in this article , i see people in the eu saying the same thing about the uk . 
  how representative is / r/unitedkingdom of the uk public , though ? 
  for example , it seems to be very enthusiastic about mr. corbyn , who does not seem to be very popular with the uk 's public at large . 
   are we going to have to listen to the same thing every week ? 
  if california ( a slightly lower-percentage of the us economy than the uk is of the eu ) were planning a referendum on leaving the us in the next year and things were anywhere remotely in the vicinity of 50 % , i 'm pretty sure that it 'd be pretty constantly in the news . 
  note that , in that timeline , the time axis is not proportional to the amount of time between events . 
  i am * astounded * by the degree of recent volatility in that graph showing whether the uk public wants the uk to be in the eu or not , just in the last two years . 
  i could have understood , say , the refugee crisis or something driving opinions in one direction or the other , but instead opinion is changing tremendously in both directions within a few months . 
  you 're talking about a `` exit '' winning by ~ 5 % ; 18 months later `` stay '' winning by 30 % ; 6 months later `` exit '' and `` stay '' being neck-and-neck . 
  it seems to me that very little information about the benefits and drawbacks of eu membership have changed in the last twenty-four months . 
  i 'm kind of wondering whether some of the polls here might have different sources , and whether some might not be representative samples . 
   perhaps in 100 - 200 years when every european country is broadly similar , seventy years ago , half of europe was busy trying to kill the other half . 
  surely you 'd agree that the bulk of this distance has already been traveled ? 
   a country that can not accept foreigners should not benefit from having such essential , international institutions why is cern 's location such a big deal ? 
  the us funds various cern projects , and cern is n't in the us . 
  switzerland is pretty accessible to people from most european countries . 
  it sounds kind of like using cern funding as a club just for the sake of having a club to pressure switzerland , not because there 's actually any problem with having cern in switzerland . 
   this is a direct endorsement of a multi-speed eu , which i personally find rather appealing . 
  particularly in the way it is described in the article . 
  the uk would like to open up more markets and make it easier to engage in trade ; italy would like tighter integration . 
  if there 's a single `` tier '' , it is hard for either of the two to do these things , since the bar for expansion is too high for the uk and the friction to integration too much for italy . 
  eh , kind of a politically-contentious time . 
  the us is pretty non-violent these days , but [ it has seen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legislative_violence#united_states ) legislators engage in knife murder , beat people to unconsciousness with weapons , and brawls . 
  if it were in ukraine 's situation , i expect that things might get a bit more-heated , back to civil war levels . 
  some of those probably involve investment to increase production -- like milk -- where you normally expect roi to take some years . 
  unless russian industry can rely on the sanctions not to be lifted for some number of years , i 'd guess that investors are going to be hesitant to put money into the thing -- too much uncertainty . 
   led all too often by what he calls `` centurions '' well , certainly lends itself to entertaining imagery , at any rate . 
  maybe it 's just my across-the-atlantic perspective , but i think that the technological changes were bigger than the political ones ( well , okay , the rise and fall of communism was a pretty big deal , maybe on par with the rise of democracy against monarchy ) . 
  there are people still alive who were around when electricity was something used mostly for lighting , and just in cities ; horses were how most people got around , and plastics were just emerging in laboratories . 
  heavier-than-air flight was something that a few crazy inventors were playing around with . 
  outside of a few european countries like the uk , the bulk of the people in most countries still lived in rural environments , and were mostly-concerned in one way or another with small-scale farming . 
  the world today is such a radically different place from that . 
  title : europe hanging by a thread subtitle : our panel of political science experts examine the question of whether the european union is likely to collapse in the next five years . 
  this also has impact for users not in the eu , as : * it means that the cost of implementing things like data purges already has to be done for companies doing business in the eu . 
  * information about what is being recorded becomes available ( unless things differ from country to country ) . 
  at least in the us , older people have higher turnout rates than the younger , actually . 
  [ us presidential elections vary from ~ 50 % to ~ 80 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voter_turnout_in_the_united_states_presidential_elections ) ( for all cohorts combined ) . 
  [ only every other election involves a presidential election , and `` off year '' elections for legislators are of much-less interest to the public ; in 2010 it was 36.4 % ] ( http://time.com/3576090/midterm-elections-turnout-world-war-two/ ) . 
  australia does better , but [ it has compulsory voting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voter_turnout#compulsory_voting ) :  one of the strongest factors affecting voter turnout is whether voting is compulsory . 
  in australia , voter registration and attendance at a polling booth have been mandatory since the 1920s , with the most recent federal election in 2013 having turnout figures of 93.23 % for the house of representatives and 93.88 % for the senate . 
  [ 41 ] [ 42 ] that 's [ quite uncommon as a requirement , though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compulsory_voting ) . 
  i 'm also not sold that compulsory voting is necessarily a good idea in the sense that a democracy institutionalizes `` little revolutions '' to avoid big ones , and that and the people who would take part in a big one are also probably likely to care enough to vote . 
   the politically correct , anti-capitalist , multiculturalist left ( which these days is more concerned about transgender bathrooms or the imaginary scourge of anti-semitism ) than unemployment at the behest of huge multinationals attempting to bring in as much cheap labour as possible from abroad ) has all but completely abandoned working class voter constituencies and their interests ... not saying that there is n't truth here , but this sounds kind of like a straw man . 
  who would be representative of this movement , someone like corbyn ? 
  does he * actually * spend the bulk of his time talking about transgender bathrooms ? 
  like , if i broke down his speeches , what would he be talking about most of the time ? 
  yup . 
  though [ guantanamo bay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guant%c3%a1namo_bay ) ( part of cuba ) has been continuously occupied by the us navy as part of a treaty signed by cuba after spain lost in 1898 during the spanish-american war and is still occupied ( though the us has n't ever claimed that it is anything but cuban , cuba is compelled to lease it to the us as part of that deal -- [ and does not do so willingly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuba%e2%80%93united_states_relations#guant.c3.a1namo_bay ) ) . 
  that 's not an annexation , but it 's obviously got some similarities . 
  the northern mariana islands are also in political union with the us ( after being lost by japan in world war ii ) , but they choose to have that status voluntarily rather than being annexed ; it occurred in a war and japan signed off after attacking the us first , though you could certainly draw a parallel with crimea . 
  probably more-directly comparable to kaliningrad , though ... 
  the us has attacked a lot of things , but has n't annexed land to the us for a long time . 
  granted , the us 's situation is different . 
  the us has no discussion that i have heard about addressing integration one way or the other . 
  people just move in , and popular culture bits spread where people pick them up . 
  arguing about the merits of multiculturalism or otherwise publicly-planning integration one way or another is a european thing , as far as i can tell . 
   an exception are ethnic turks , no one really knows why . 
  europe as a whole has n't done really well with integrating gypsies . 
  i think that she made the uk a lot economically-stronger . 
  california imposed a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants . 
  the municipalities promptly ran the math and started importing electricity from coal-fired power plants in surrounding states . 
  housing is actually a real sin -- almost everything in us tv is filmed in a ridiculously unrepresentative house . 
  actually , i saw * breaking bad * 's first episode for the first time the other day -- i watch almost no television -- and even they look like they have hardwood furniture , granite ( or at least synthetic rock ) countertops , only one working parent , tiffany-style lamps , and ( in an admittedly-small backyard ) a sunken swimming pool . 
  those would all go before i 'd be working a second job at a carwash on top of a full-time job . 
  nah , i did n't bookmark it -- did n't think that it was that big a deal , just laughed when i saw it .

  i see a lot of people pointing out disillusion recently , and while i 'm sure that there 's something to it , i think that there 's an underlying hope among people concerned about immigration that everyone will just , once disillusioned , give up and head back . 
  frankly , people are pretty unlikely to up and head back . 
  and this is hardly a new , unique situation . 
  http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/snpim1.htm  an old italian saying summed up the disillusionment felt by many : `` i came to america because i heard the streets were paved with gold . 
  when i got here , found out three things : first , the streets were n't paved with gold ; second , they were n't paved at all : and third , i was expected to pave them . '', 
  in spite of the difficulties , few gave up and returned home . 
  when i moved from a dry , open area where there was normally a fair expanse of sky visible to a wooded , hilly area where sky was only visible fairly-directly overhead , it felt claustrophobic at first . 
  like being in a house and having no way to go outside .

  i mean , i might call that dishonest , but i do n't know about cowardice -- i 'd guess that they 've spent a fair amount of time planning it and simply see it as an optimal plan . 
  hmm . 
  you can have machines do counting/sorting without electronic voting , though . 
  well , sorting at any rate , even if you do n't trust the counting part . 
  you will need to obtain a license -- cannon , and generally-speaking , things beyond what a rifleman would carry , are n't considered protected by the second amendment , and thus it is at least constitutional to make laws restricting their ownership and require licensing . 
  however , it 's not simply banned . 
  you can find a number of videos of people on youtube firing off cannon at shooting ranges . 
  here 's [ a 75mm german anti-tank gun being fired ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7fhbm1ousu ) . 
  that being said , it 's normally quite expensive and not common -- in terms of practical impact , i 'd say that the higher prevalence of ordinary old firearms in the us has far more impact on society than the small number of legally-owned large guns . 
   and do n't get me started on america 's stingy social insurance : even legal permanent residents are barred from a host of government programs , including medicaid , food stamps and other welfare programs .
