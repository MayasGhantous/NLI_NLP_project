  if it 's not really viable to live on welfare without working , you 're probably going to work . 
  there was also the inadvertent ethnic cleansing via disease , which was a much bigger factor .

  it 's just phenomenally risky that you 'll lose big . 
   their greatest concern is that russia will move on the three small baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania -- the only former provinces of the soviet union that have joined the north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) and that other alliance members are therefore obligated to defend . 
  i 'd want a source on that . 
   internal pentagon estimates suggest russia 's military could occupy the baltic states in 2-3 days -- well before nato could organize a coherent response . 
  sure . 
  but then they 'd be in a position of facing a much larger and nastier collection of militaries . 
  * most * countries could make use of a move-first advantage to get something done . 
  it 's the consequences that dissuade them . 
   the russians enjoy massive local superiority in tactical nuclear weapons , and moscow 's military doctrine gives such weapons more prominence in warfighting plans than western thinking does . 
  because that 's the only card that russia has to play , other than maybe trying to play hardcore and claim willingness to use strategic nuclear weapons . 
   that we all look back at the us intervention in libya today and have to realize that the situation has gone from bad to worse . 
  libya was primarily a french project , which the us was requested to come in on and came in as per request from y' all on the other side of the atlantic .

   they 're all too craven to have a proper debate i do n't know any details , but i doubt that it is personal cowardice responsible for any lack of debate . 
  more to the point , it 's entirely-possible that some russian military pilot just screwed up . 
  easier to let it slide and expect the same sort of flexibility in return , as long as it 's not intentionally abused or creating a threat , than in turning every legal-to-shoot-down situation into an actual shootdown . 
   all the putin fans were telling me there are no actual violations , just defense zone violations . 
  i frequently point out where there are n't actual violations . 
  that 's not the same as `` no '' violations , but i 've too-frequently seen people treating articles that do n't describe violations as claiming a violation . 
  tannenburg was pretty bad . 
  he posts pro-russia comments . 
  they tend to involve divisiveness between one of : * the us and the eu .

  * nato members .

  hmm . 
  if someone 's untrustworthy , seems like there 's value in letting them dig a hole for themselves . 
  how influential is rt in poland , anyway ? 
   ... the least atlanticist president since world war ii . 
  is this just a random date , or is it calling fdr not atlanticist ? 
   but the new putin doctrine directly threatens nato 's three vulnerable member states on the baltic : latvia , estonia and lithuania . 
  that doctrine is `` annex nato member nations '' ? 
  i 'm pretty skeptical .

  technically sailboats have right-of-way over powered vessels . 
  however , as my dad , who spent some time aboard sailing vessels , once put it to me , you probably do n't want to sail in front of a two-mile-turning-radius oil tanker , even if your corpse would enjoy the legal right of the matter . 
  to be fair , remember that [ this has been a tactic successfully used ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_cole_bombing ) when a destroyer refrained from firing . 
   the destroyer 's rules of engagement , as approved by the pentagon , kept its guards from firing upon the small boat ( which was not known to be loaded with explosives ) as it neared them without first obtaining permission from the cole ' s captain or another officer . 
  [ 38 ]   petty officer john washak said that right after the blast , a senior chief petty officer ordered him to turn an m-60 machine gun on the cole ' s fantail away from a second small boat approaching . 
  `` with blood still on my face '' , he said , he was told : `` that 's the rules of engagement : no shooting unless we 're shot at . '', 
   the f-35 is also a very beautiful plane that 's certainly a subjective thing , but i do n't think that contemporary stealth designs look all that pleasing to the eye .

  i 'm amazed that the technical constraints on it came out so close to something that i 'd expect an industrial designer to churn out for the appearance . 
  hmm . 
  that 's an intriguing-sounding objection that i have n't heard before . 
  why would this need be the case ? 
  let 's say , for example , that i have two columns -- one for first choice , the second for second choice . 
  this is a simple ranked voting system . 
  why could n't this be done non-electronically ? 
  sure , you could potentially create an invalid ballot , by choosing the same choice twice , but we already deal with invalid ballots without ranked voting by just invalidating the ballot ( though in that case , it 'd probably make sense to just ignore the second vote ) . 
  i do n't have any problem with moldova joining , but there 's a obligation to defend it if it joins . 
  those things are fucking dangerous . 
   there are special licenses that are given to collectors and certain people or institutions , but they are not generally available for regular folks . 
  yup , you 'll need an ffl , but those are n't restricted to military -- you can obtain one . 
  they just are n't guaranteed to be available as a right . 
   personally i am a fan of ranked voting systems [ 2 ] as a more natural solution to this problem . 
  i agree with wanting ranked voting systems . 
  proportional representation tends to sacrifice geographic representation -- you support a party , rather than a candidate .

  well , people have a [ right to demonstrate over here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) :  congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .

  their political opponents then showed up . 
  if you just let the sides fight it out , you 're effectively granting mob rule over who can demonstrate : it 's possible to physically-intimidate people from taking part in political speech . 
  i 'm a little skeptical that anyone is actually intentionally-seeking sentences , but if it 's a real issue ... serious terrorists who get hit by the us federal system have a tendency to wind up in places like [ adx florence supermax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adx_florence#foreign_terrorists ) . 
  it 's [ not very conducive to spreading any sort of ideas ] ( http://sometimes-interesting.com/2011/07/12/the-most-secure-prison-adx-florence/ ) :  adx florence is known for its harsh conditions ; inmates are kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day . 
  the hour they are allowed out is into a bigger cell with vaulted ceilings called the `` empty swimming pool . '' this room has a 4-inch by 4-foot skylight as the only window . 
  it is designed to prevent the prisoners from knowing where they are , and they still spend this time alone . 
    for at least the first three years , prisoners are not allowed to come into contact with other prisoners at any time -- anywhere on the premises . 
  over time , good behavior can earn inmates more `` outside '' time , and for the most fortunate a possible transfer back to a less-secure prison can await . 
    the cell furniture is limited to a desk , stool , and a bed , and each is constructed of poured concrete .
