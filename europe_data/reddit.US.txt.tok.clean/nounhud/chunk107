  the toilets are designed to shut off if plugged and the showers are on timers . 
  rooms may have mirrors , lights , radios , and in very rare instances televisions -- but these are used as privileges based on behavior and are seldom awarded . 
    there is no mess hall ; food is hand-delivered to each inmate by the guards . 
  the prison has a multitude of motion detectors and cameras , 1,400 remote-controlled steel doors , and 12-foot high razor wire fences . 
  as an added level of security , laser beams , pressure pads , and attack dogs guard the area surrounding the prison 's outlying fences . 
  the uk has their own [ supermax system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supermax_prison#united_kingdom ) , and i expect that if this is a real problem , they certainly have the ability to structure it in such a way that the prison system both isolates someone and is somewhere that nobody would want to actually go . 
  if this is anything like the explosives tests that are used at airports , it 's possible for false positives to show up . 
  i would n't get * that * excited yet . 
  hmm . 
  i agree that a lot of dot-com companies make money from data-mining , and i think that there is good reason to believe that people do not want -- or at least do not understand -- the coin that is changing hands to change hands . 
  i am not very impressed with the summary of the book -- it looks like a great deal of political drama . 
  a substantial chunk of the intensely-anti-surveillance privacy people i have run into are from silicon valley , and a lot of related efforts , like the eff , stem from there as well . 
  that might be due to more-awareness of what sort of data extraction happens , granted , but it 's still there . 
    `` old high quality color photos always seem like modern times . '', 
    i do n't know how old you are but ... no , not at all . 
  they do to me . 
  i 've seen so many photos with different technology that i really key it to the time and it is a bit disorienting to see photos that look like they were taken with technology from another time . 
  the eu is pretty much that plus more , yes ? 
  it looks like austria-hungary included some of modern-day ukraine , but if ukraine makes it in ... 
  i know , i 'm saying that the cia does n't get them . 
  honestly , military aircraft are not cheap to operate . 
  if someone 's cash-strapped and ca n't buy the stuff , it 's not necessarily making their life better to dump tons of stuff that they ca n't afford mechanics and parts and crud on . 
  here 's the cost-per-flight-hour for a bunch of [ us air force aircraft ] ( http://nation.time.com/2013/04/02/costly-flight-hours/ ) . 
  now , that includes the amortized purchase price , which would n't be relevant here , but it gives an idea of what 's involved . 
  another statistic listed : for the f-35 :  the cost has risen to $ 150ma copy ... all in all over the projected lifetime of 50 years about $ 800 m per plane . 
  operating costs are no joke : they dominate the cost of the plane . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_air_force  previous aircraft operated by the latvian air force were the pzl-104 wilga , an-2 , let-410 , and the mil mi-2 helicopter . 
  all have either been placed in storage , or are unserviceable . 
  [ 5 ] i 'd expect that they 're out-of-service because latvia ca n't reasonably afford to maintain and operate them . 
  sending over a hodgepodge of different hardware presumably makes it even harder for small countries to leverage economy of scale . 
  as soon as the super-expensive dingus on the side hits its end of life , they 're going to have to go into the warehouse . 
  stashing military hardware somewhere might have an unrelated benefit in that it improves credibility of claims that nato will defend that place . 
  maybe that makes it worthwhile , but i do n't think that `` send over lots of random hardware because military budgets are low '' with the intent that the hardware will get a lot of active use is going to help actual military effectiveness that much unless operation is also going to be subsidized . 
  if one were trying to find something that would be most-helpful in actual use ( aside from outright cash subsidies , obviously ) , i 'd guess that it would probably mirror the existing military inventory of those countries ( [ lithuania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_army_equipment ) as an example ) , assuming that the military planners who made the existing purchasing decisions were n't nitwits , which i assume they are not . 
  there are n't gobs of tanks ( lots of overhaul time , part replacements required ) or planes . 
  there * are * things that let defending infantry be a threat to expensive hardware attacking them , like stingers and anti-tank weapons , and lightly-armored or unarmored vehicles . 
  things that make motorized infantry more-dangerous . 
  those do n't require the constant cash flow to maintain them . 
   maintenance sites for what the army is calling european activity sets in estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania and bulgaria ... really and honestly , it * does * sound like some sort of wacky kids toy set . 
  i 'm sure that there 's some sort of inscrutable politics behind the name , but ... 
   japan took the overall title for consuming the least calories on average , although the modern tradition of eating a kfc box meal can hardly be described as healthy . 
  i 'm not sure whether japan is more-american than the us or just plain alien . 
  would you , personally , actually object to corbyn entering the us ? 
  i mean , i think that the trump petition is dumb , but i have a hard time seeing a a corbyn petition as anything but dumb either . 
  probably good times for [ russian polyester factories ] ( http://www.innovationintextiles.com/russia-new-plant-for-polyester-fibre-and-nonwovens/ ) : lots of cheap crude oil , and consumers that have their external supply of alternatives curtailed . 
  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:russia_export_treemap.png big in the [ primary sector ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primary_sector_of_the_economy ) . 
  weapons do n't appear to be that big a deal . 
  hmm . 
  is that your own assessment , or based on a particular source that you trust ? 
     a large majority of people here ( usually with non-german flairs ) are decrying this and bringing up hitler 's person of the year selection or trying to play it down by saying that time is n't making some moral judgement but rather selecting her purely due to influence ( even though it literally says `` chancellor of the free world '' on the cover ) . 
  that always comes up , because a lot of people have the impression that time 's thing is an endorsement -- it 's often a very laudable person making it on there , and so if someone disagrees they get upset and start ranting about it . 
  you wo n't find any major `` time person of the year '' reddit article that does n't mention this . 
   they use balloon decoys . 
  that will create a radar signature , but it wo n't be moving anything like the reentry vehicle . 
   there are no credible programs to counter the nuclear threat even in a speculative sense . 
  < shrug  there are a lot of dollars that have and continue to go into work on it . 
  i 'd assume that the people involved are capable of sanity-checking the programs as well as you or i. 
  the article does n't really explain why this is a particular military concern . 
  i 'm certainly no expert on the area , but ... 
  doing so would be an act of war , so things would have to get pretty dicey before this would be an issue . 
  in any situation where it seems like russia would say `` you put ships in the baltic and we sink them '' , i 'd kind of expect that there would be a lot of world military concerns above just getting ships into the baltic . 
  kaliningrad-based russian military and any us navy ships are both capable of whacking each other ; it 's hardly a one-way affair . 
  i also do n't understand why kaliningrad in particular would be a big deal versus russia proper or the russian baltic fleet . 
   turkey is not in europe culturally i think that it would be hard to find a consensus definition on `` culturally part of europe '' . 
  if it 's `` not muslim '' , i 'm pretty sure that albania is going to be somewhat-irked . 
   fighting against gravity you bleed you energy by maveuvering . 
  hmm . 
  your concern is that the interceptor wo n't be able to catch up , rather than that it wo n't be able to properly maneuver ? 
   computers are capable responding to changes , but radars fall short when trying to accurately track so fast moving and small object that sets up decoys as it goes . 
  there 's some concern there , but you 're going to have to expend mass on a decoy that will exhibit the same properties as a legitimate warhead-carrying vehicle . 
  if you have to give up a warhead to fit a decoy on board , you do n't gain much , for example . 
   those missiles are fast enough enough to outrun pretty much anything after their boost phase . 
  you can detect it , but changes are you wo n't have assets in place to take it out near the launching site . 
  afaik , none of the presently-active us missile shield work involves or requires hitting something before the boost phase . 
  ( to be fair , afaik lasers also are n't part of presently-active us missile shield work either -- i 'm just saying that they permit for maneuvering issues to be addressed if that was your fundamental disadvantage to the defender ) . 
   it may go off even if you somewhat hit it . 
  i 'm not familiar with the risks there . 
  i 'd guess that there 's a good chance that the first stage would n't have the explosive lens properly go off sufficiently to result in use of all of the first stage or the second stage , but that 's a risk . 
  it would be going off not where intended , on the other hand , and triggering early would not permit for the desired destruction . 
   energy weapons are easily countered . 
  < shrug  could be . 
  they are n't part of current us missile shield efforts , so i assume that they have limitations that make them less-favorable than anti-missile missiles . 
  not even one cooking post .

  i agree with wikipedia 's [ summary of the critics , though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enemy_at_the_gates ) . 
  i know , i know , you need to broaden appeal on war movies if you want to lug both the guy and the girl into the theater , but there are so many war films that have a love story awkwardly-shoehorned in that ...

  russia has ratified this . 
   he 's been a rather successful and effective president for the russian people before the whole ukraine debacle . 
  honestly , i do n't really know his history well , but iirc the first thing he hit in office was the [ * kursk * disaster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kursk_submarine_disaster ) , and i understand that he generally was n't viewed as having had a particularly-skillful handling of it . 
  it 's younger than gps is ( i mean , gps may have gotten upgrade work done at points , but ... ), 
   what i would be interested in is how often western aircraft make such incursions into russia , or russian allied airspace .
