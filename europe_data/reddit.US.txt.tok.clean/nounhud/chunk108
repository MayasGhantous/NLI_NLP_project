  i doubt it happens today in the same way ( barring something accidental ) , simply because in a modern nuclear war , icbms and slbms rather than bombers are the bulk of the things being thrown around . 
  not much reason to put combat aircraft there . 
  the us has had a history of violating soviet airspace with unarmed spy aircraft . 
  however , spy satellite improvements have made them generally-preferable to spy aircraft ... besides also avoiding airspace violations . 
  given that the [ sr-71 has been dead since 1998 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_sr-71_blackbird ) and [ no potential replacements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northrop_grumman_rq-180 ) that could [ viably dick around in russian airspace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_martin_sr-72 ) without being shot down have yet come online , i 'm guessing that it has n't been happening for some time , at least from the us . 
  nah , [ that asshole james bond gets all the cool coupes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_james_bond_vehicles ) . 
  this ( unlike the turkey situation ) is n't a violation . 
  they were just flying towards the controlled airspace . 
   if russia is n't careful they 're going to get another aircraft shot down . 
  flying near airspace is n't the same thing as flying through it , though . 
  i mean , you have to detect and intercept a fast-moving object . 
  that may not be easy , but neither is it impossible , and i do n't see why the defender is at some sort of necessary disadvantage . 
  there 's nothing theoretically that ca n't be done there . 
  at one point , the idea of firing a homing missile that could reliably hit a jet airplane was * also * a pie-in-the-sky idea . 
  true , the cost of missing becomes very high , but that 's really the only truly fundamental disadvantage that i can see . 
  there are a couple of things that you can do to mitigate the issue . 
  * you can make a missile that has a computer capable of responding to any course-changes very rapidly . 
  [ thaad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terminal_high_altitude_area_defense ) does n't have a warhead and needs to come in physical contact , and i agree that that suffers from certain fundamental limitations -- at least theoretically , a reentry vehicle could make a course change as fast as the interceptor , so you would need to respond to course changes within the time that the reentry vehicle can shift its course via its own radius . 
  however , it 's not clear to me that this is a physical impossibility . 
  * [ russia has a very limited nuclear anti-icbm system deployed around moscow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a-135_anti-ballistic_missile_system ) that would send a missile with a nuclear warhead up to somewhere within the same vague neighborhood as an incoming warhead and set it off . 
  that very large explosion reduces how accurate the thing needs to be -- you 've got a fairly large sphere that the warhead needs to be detonated within . 
  if you can come * close * to doing a warheadless approach like the above , you can tack on a warhead and accept reduced accuracy . 
  * you can make use of something like a laser . 
  there , if you can accurately aim the thing and put enough energy into the thing , you 're moving at the speed of light . 
  the us navy has [ experimental weaponized pulse lasers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reht44buask ) that can bring down aircraft . 
  i agree with you that the problem is not trivial , but then again , [ neither was putting the icbms into space in the first place ] ( http://zenpencils.com/comic/64-robert-h-goddard-the-rocket-man/ ) , either , and that got solved . 
  it seems a more-doable defense problem to me than , say , defending against cannon fire , and people came up with all sorts of clever approaches to dealing with cannon -- [ reactive armor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactive_armour ) or [ composite armor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/composite_armour ) were shifts from many decades of `` make armor thicker '' . 
   single nuclear submarine packs more heat than all the conventional military power in the world combined . 
  yeah , but actually using it runs a high risk of escalation to severe levels . 
  which is actually a real pain in the rear from russia 's standpoint , since russia is comparatively-strong in nuclear military power compared to economic or conventional military power ... but ca n't make use of that power without risk of immense costs , whereas countries can throw out things like sanctions with impunity . 
   no matter how much dick waving there is , it always boils down to mutually assured destruction in the end . 
  the korean war did n't turn nuclear , though there was direct us/uk-soviet/chinese combat . 
   russian military airplanes caused 266 incidents this year , which jets from \u00c4mari airbase have had to respond to . 
  [ followed by a picture of a-10 jets at \u00c4mari , obviously not what anyone would use to respond to an air incursion ], 
  if you 're planning to establish a new state where your actions * are * acceptable , at some point you do want the masks to come off to give your actions legitimacy . 
  the fact that isis members need to have their face covered when doing things makes something of a statement on whether those actions can -- be considered safe and legitimate to perform . 
  isis members still need to make use of the defense of being hard to identify relative to other people . 
  what seems like a really bad idea to me , on the other hand , is dropping the masks and then traveling to a country with a government which is definitely hostile to this . 
  your comment was pointing out people criticizing what amounted to themselves , but treating the target as if it were something foreign . 
  * the simpsons * happened to have a clip of the same thing being done . 
  i do n't really want to know what the rammstein lyrics are . 
  i 'm usually disappointed by song lyrics , and because i do n't speak german , i can enjoy the music without being annoyed by what they 're saying . 
  also like [ asp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmtcnzaj-du&amp;index=2&amp;list=plsjfvndfwm0oxyeuda19w7-3k88xuc6u9 ) , speaking of german rock . 
  they ruined scotland !,

  i liked estonia 's quite a bit , actually . 
  it 's one of the few where the people tried to do something quite different from the `` dark wood/pillars and tradition '' or the sci-fi/ultramodern look that a lot tried . 
  the estonian legislators also get their own desks , which most did not -- i imagine that getting people in or out of the bench seating in many of these is a real pain . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/romantic  usage 1 : ( chiefly historical ) of a work of literature , a writer etc. 
  : being like or having the characteristics of a romance , or poetic tale of a mythic or quasi-historical time ; fantastic . 
  [ from 17th c. ] [ snip ]  usage 4 : having the qualities of romance ( in the sense of something appealing deeply to the imagination ) ; invoking on a powerfully sentimental idea of life ; evocative , atmospheric . 
  [ from 17th c. ] does n't have to just be :  usage 5 : pertaining to an idealised form of love ( originally , as might be felt by the heroes of a romance ) ; conducive to romance ; loving , affectionate . 
  [ from 18th c. ]    their kiss started casually , but it slowly turned romantic . 
  the bosnian upper house looks like it 's one of the few that would have non-awful acoustics , though -- those wooden slat things are * amazing * for trapping sound , if you 've ever been in a room that has them installed . 
   yes yes evil russia communistic empire trying to achieve world domination . 
  i do n't think that it said * that * . 
  the eu is a competitor with russia . 
  it is substantially-larger than russia . 
  it is very much in russia 's interests to have it break up . 
  that does n't seem particularly controversial . 
  on the other hand , i do n't know exactly how enthusiastic those governments would actually be about russia when in power -- supporting political parties is a very blunt tool . 
  germany re-inserted lenin into russia during world war i and successfully helped the russian government and thus war effort against germany to collapse . 
  but it 's not as if the political movement that lenin kicked off wound up particularly supportive of germany after that , though it was advantageous to germany in the short term . 
   they are biding their time , but trust me , putin is not popular . 
  i 'm skeptical . 
  i believe that russia certainly does use intimidation against political opposition . 
  i 've seen convincing material ( like the statistical analysis of votes ) that would support some degree of vote fraud . 
  i certainly feel that russia makes use of government-controlled media to propagandize for the existing leadership . 
  however , i am doubtful that putin is , in fact , particularly unpopular . 
  who is the alternate leader that russians are longing for instead of putin ? 
  well , the russian constitutional crisis , the chechen wars , and the war of dagestan appear to have been domestic russian affairs . 
  might have sucked for russians , but i do n't think that it was directly-impacting other countries , which is what / u/apfsds-t was complaining about . 
   you would not have any conflicts with moscow , either , if you submitted . 
  like , in the winter war ? 
  the estonians here did n't really have a realistic option to * not * submit at that time and did so and they seem to have some friction with moscow . 
  it 's possible that having a `` rebuild russia '' policy in the 1990s would have paid off . 
  it would also have led to serious suspicion of trying to control the country , maybe harmed the legitimacy of the government , and any failures would have been blamed on the rebuilding countries . 
  it would have been * bitterly * hated by any remaining advocates of a planned economy . 
  also , i do n't think that anyone quite expected the degree of problems that russia hit . 
  i still have a hard time believing that russia could n't have negotiated a peaceful renewal if she * really * wanted to do so . 
   all it has now is a slice of destroyed eastern ukraine , and crimea . 
  russia has an internationally-unrecognized occupation of same with economic penalties whose lifting is tied to russia leaving . 
   given the numbers dropped on is , this sounds like a good idea . 
  that * is * a good point , though . 
  looking at these , the warheads being used ( which are probably frequently against unarmored targets ) are 20lb anti-tank to 500lb . 
  those were designed to knock out tanks or flatten large buildings , not knock off a single person . 
  they 're expensive , and they probably often make things difficult in that they will kill anyone else in the area . 
  it does look like there are at least some efforts on very-small , guided munitions , which probably make more sense and are cheaper . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spike_%28missile%29 ) looks like it costs about $ 5k/shot , less than 5 % of what a hellfire does , has variants with a comparable range and its 1lb warhead is probably fine for unarmored targets . 
   the rest of europe norway probably is n't very happy . 
   it is still impressive that the us could run out of supply the articles do n't say that they ran out , but that they had to pull from us state-side reserves . 
   the us are already running out of bombs hmm . 
  the only source online says that there is a shortage of the relatively small-warhead [ hellfire air-to-ground missiles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agm-114_hellfire ) . 
  us hellfires were [ apparently shared out with coalition partners who were themselves short ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/12/03/isil-iraq-syria-hellfire-missiles-drones/76741954/ ) . 
  i also see references to the much-cheaper and more-powerful [ gbu-38 and gbu-54 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joint_direct_attack_munition ) guided bombs being used , but nothing about a shortage of these . 
  the tornado , the b-52 , and the f-35 can all handle these . 
  i 'm a little dubious that this is a good idea on enforceability grounds alone , but come on . 
  markets exist because of someone creating property rules in which they exist . 
  things like [ compulsory licenses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compulsory_license ) , [ patents ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patent ) , [ moral rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral_rights ) , [ copyright ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copyright ) , and [ trademark ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trademark ) are all things that , whether ideal or not , certainly exist alongside or enable markets , and probably would not exist in even a crude form in the absence of some form of constructed framework . 
  i do wonder if this applies to reddit .
