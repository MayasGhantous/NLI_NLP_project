   according to a report in novaya gazeta , russia 's domestic intelligence agency -- the federal security service or fsb -- facilitated the travel of russian fighters headed to syria . 
  this seems like the sort of thing that you 'd link to if you 're citing it .

   you 're scared of what you dont know i dunno , man . 
  i do n't lie awake at night worrying about micronesians . 
   the ruling socialist party , which is leading in three regions , has opted for the former , urging its candidates to stand aside in nord-pas de calais , where ms le pen is leading , provence-alpes-cotes d\u2019azur in the south , where her niece , marion mar\u00e9chal le pen is also in pole position , and in the east . 
  it called on its supporters instead to back second-placed centre-right candidates .

  hmm . 
  is afd opposed to the use of the euro in germany ? 
   my personal proposal would be a federal standard for rifle ownership at least as stringent as that of driving + owning a car . 
  you 'd need to start that by amending the us constitution . 
  there 's no constitutional right to possess a car . 
  do n't forget use of american samoa : counts as the us for for `` made in the usa '' labels , but historically not subject to us labor law . 
   it is not possible to maintain the high living standard europeans have become used to by producing cheap textiles and shoes . 
  better automation ? 
  on the other hand , apparently the eu banned dip . 
   eh , i think i can limit the things with the late 19th century or 20th century you do n't agree with border changes since the late 19th century ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that eastern europe would n't be very enthralled about the idea of the ussr being reconstituted . 
  the uk is holding land that is n't part of the country of cyprus . 
  cyprus might want to take that territory for itself , but that 's a different matter . 
  there 's nothing particularly unusual about countries bordering land that they 'd like to have and not taking it . 
  it 's a little less-common for islands to be split between different countries , which might be the objection you 're thinking of , but it 's certainly not unheard of , including within the eu . 
  a [ list of one month of north korea 's threats in 2013 ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/21/a-running-list-of-north-koreas-near-daily-threats-updated/ ) . 
   somewhat sad to think that we 'd never get a visit of these floating wonders in times of peace in the black sea . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montreux_convention_regarding_the_regime_of_the_straits#terms_and_consequences_of_the_convention  turkey was authorised to close the straits to all foreign warships in wartime or when it was threatened by aggression ; additionally , it was authorised to refuse transit from merchant ships belonging to countries at war with turkey . 
  a number of highly specific restrictions were imposed on what type of warships are allowed passage . 
  non-black sea state warships in the straits must be under 15,000 tons . 
  no more than nine non-black sea state warships , with a total aggregate tonnage of no more than 30,000 tons , may pass at any one time , and they are permitted to stay in the black sea for no longer than twenty-one days . 
    although the treaty is often cited as prohibiting aircraft carriers in the straits , [ 12 ] there is no explicit prohibition on aircraft carriers in the treaty . 
  however , the tonnage limits in article 14 , which apply to all non-black sea powers , would preclude the transit of modern aircraft carrying ships . 
  in the case of non-black sea powers , these terms make it impossible for transit any modern ships carrying aircraft through the straits without violating the terms of the convention . 
    by contrast , black sea powers such as the ussr were able to transit aircraft carrying cruisers through the straits under other terms of the convention . 
  as with non-black seas powers , the montreux convention does not explicitly forbid a black sea power from transiting aircraft carriers through the straits , and the tonnage limits in article 14 also apply to black sea powers as well as non-black sea powers . 
  however , under article 11 , black sea states are permitted to transit capital ships of any tonnage through the straits . 
  annex ii specifically excludes aircraft carriers from the definition of capital ships , but limits the definition of carriers to ships that are designed primarily for carrying and operating aircraft at sea and specifically excludes other ships that merely are able to operate aircraft . 
  [ 13 ]   the result of this is that by designing its aircraft carrying ships such as kiev and admiral kuznetsov to have roles other than aircraft operation and by designating those ships as `` aircraft carrying cruisers '' rather than `` aircraft carriers '' the soviet union was able to transit its aircraft carrying ships through the straits in compliance with the convention , while at the same time the convention denied access to nato aircraft carriers , which are not covered by the exemption in article 11 . 
  perhaps forgiveness of that debt could be viewed as an initial payment towards war reparations for the damage caused ukraine . 
   nato has provided security from armed conflicts , however the education , economic , and political security were supposed to come from the eu , which has failed to do so at every turn . 
  in the eu 's defense , providing security from armed conflicts is a problem with better-understood solutions . 
  and then a fire breaks out onboard . 
   to save itself after paris , europe must first rediscover itself i bet that it does n't . 
  also , the 1951 refugee convention mandates providing welfare at the same level to refugees as to nationals . 
  never trust version 1.0 . 
  it has bugs . 
   since eveything is dependent on us consent anyways , it does not really matter whether the nukes are in poland or germany . 
  provides the us with a the option of delegating them to someone closer to the front lines in the event of conflict , which might be a rather-more-convincing threat of use . 
  i 'd think that a more-interesting question would be how much of a concern the reduction in flight time would be , to be honest . 
  trained us navy personnel screwed up on [ iran air flight 655 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655 ) despite having all that data right in front of them . 
  i 'm pretty sure that trained russian military personnel can too . 
  i 'm pretty sure that domestic cats exist at the population maximum -- we euthanize excess population rather than letting them starve , but same idea . 
  if those women are n't keeping the cat , it would n't be around . 
  if i were a cat , i 'd rather be drinking human breast milk than be dead . 
  just saying . 
   notice russia picks fights with people who cant fight back ... sanctions against the eu and turkey ? 
  and , hell , you could point out almost any governments as being a lot more willing to fight smaller countries than larger ones . 
  i mean , i 'm not very enthusiastic about putin , but the whole `` country is on the other side so the government has character flaws up the wazoo '' thing is kinda weak . 
   under the new system , drivers must buy a tracking device and pay according to their mileage . 
  an 800-mile round trip between moscow and st. petersburg costs an extra $ 33 at current exchange rates and will rise to $ 66 next march . 
  that might be economically-efficient in billing , but it 's kinda creepy from a police state standpoint . 
  mig-29 and su-27 donations welcome . 
  at one point , `` troll '' referred to the verbal equivalent for `` trolling for fish '' -- that is , motoring along slowly , trying to attract bites . 
  someone would post a comment on a forum to try to get responses that would generate a terrific controversy . 
  however , over time it 's been applied to mean all sorts of things , from `` lying '' to `` engaging in political advocacy '' to `` shilling '' . 
  i 'm having a harder time knowing what someone using the term means any more . 
   why get involved in the gigantic mess in africa when you 've no stake in the region ? 
  because if eu members start picking-and-choosing their conflicts , it weakens all the members ? 
  to say nothing of their much-more extreme interference in continental europe 's political affairs in the '40s . 
   in mid-october , europe 's largest political party -- the epp , which is center-right ideologically -- awarded him its robert schuman medal for his work on data-protection issues . 
  the only other american to get the award is former president george h.w. 
  bush . 
  i mean ... while i like the sentiment in the article and all , the only two americans that were given that award were the guy that wrote the patriot act and an ex-director of the cia ? 
  i 'm wondering who the people were who were found * unworthy * of the award .

  [ already declared war elsewhere ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/nyc-islamic-state-plot-italian-mafia-warns-isis-stay-away-new-york-2196169 ) :  gambino actually told nbc news that the new york mob was prepared to protect the city against terrorism ... the italian mafia in new york has issued a warning to the islamic state group : if you come to the five boroughs , you 're going to find yourself in a fight with the mob . 
  a man claiming to represent the italian crime organization said it will do its part to protect new yorkers from terrorist attacks and that it is better-positioned to provide security than federal agencies like the fbi and department of homeland security . 
    `` they often act too late or fail to see a complete picture of what 's happening due to a lack of ` human intelligence , ' '' giovanni gambino , the son of a new york mob boss , told nbc news . 
  `` the mafia has a bad reputation , but much of that 's undeserved .

  four of the origin states , syria , afghanistan , somalia , and pakistan , are among the few remaining reservoirs of the [ polio virus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poliomyelitis ) , for example . 
   poliovirus is usually spread from person to person through infected feces entering the mouth . 
  [ 1 ] ... and you 've got a lot of people living illegally in camps in places like calais without sanitary facilities , or traveling across southeastern europe and in the same position . 
  i mean , someone gets feces on their hand , they go travel on a train and spread them around ... that 's not an ideal situation . 
   severe winters can lead to ice formation around southern sweden and even in the danish straits . 
  according to the 18th-century natural historian william derham , during the severe winters of 1703 and 1708 , the ice cover reached as far as the danish straits . 
  [ 24 ] frequently , parts of the gulf of bothnia and gulf of finland are frozen , in addition to coastal fringes in more southerly locations such as the gulf of riga . 
  this description meant that the whole of the baltic sea was covered with ice . 
    it is known that since 1720 , the baltic sea has frozen over entirely a total of 20 times . 
  the risky but vastly successful crossing was a crushing blow to denmark , and led to the treaty of roskilde later that year , which handed scania to sweden . 
   neither country is going to attack each other so it 's just childish mudslinging at this point the sanctions are n't really childish mudslinging .
