  sucks to be russia 's economy right about now . 
   they did a great job , i 'll tell you that . 
  thanks , but how much correlation is there in power for the typical country over 200 years ? 
  i would guess that it 's kind of abnormal for things to just stay mostly-static and see slow shifts over a thousand-year timeframe . 
  not saying that that 's not the case , but what data supports the idea that they are ? 
  i do n't recall seeing any statistical data on that before . 
  i can certainly recall more incidents of terrorism associated with islam , but i assume that you 're talking about education or income or health or something like that , a more-traditional sense of the word `` successful '' . 
   either the ocean or the united states or denmark ? 
  at a certain point , with australia in and romania out , i do n't think that you can legitimately call it `` eurovision '' . 
  if it were seen as advantageous to the uk to be out , why would n't the uk 's leadership have simply taken the uk out ? 
  why would they be campaigning for remain ? 
  here 's an archive of [ obama speeches ] ( http://obamaspeeches.com/099-announcement-for-president-springfield-illinois-obama-speech.htm ) . 
  try to count how many * do n't * contain the term `` friend '' / `` friends '' / etc. 
  his speechwriters like using it . 
  that 's fair , but the colonies kicked it off , and it was n't until they were well into the war and doing well that france decided to support them . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/france_in_the_american_revolutionary_war  france played a key role in the american revolutionary war ( american war of independence ; 1775 -- 1783 ) . 
  after the americans captured a british army , france recognized and allied itself with them in 1778 , declared war on britain , provided money and mat\u00e9riel to arm the new republic , and sent an army to the united states . 
  if the us had been offered a federal organization , it 'd probably still be in the british federation . 
  what it got was overseas authorities making rules for it without input on them . 
   america is the only country in the * world * not to sign up to the un convention on the rights of the child ... -- boris johnson hmm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_on_the_rights_of_the_child#united_states  the united states government played an active role in the drafting of the convention and signed it on 16 february 1995 , but has not ratified it because [ citation needed ] it forbids both the death penalty and life imprisonment for children ... 
  the heck with that restrictive nonsense . 
   i mean france only had relative independence at all because de gaulle basically buggered off and liberated paris himself . 
  ... what ? 
  drinking water via desalination wo n't be a problem in the middle east ( not as long as the oil holds , at any rate ) . 
  israel actually has a viable arid-land agricultural industry based on desalinated water -- sell high-value stuff , do everything you can to retain water , etc. 
  yeah , it 's more-difficult than it would be in more-hospitable climates , but it 's doable . 
   yes , but the uk has never wanted to be part of a us of europe . 
  i will agree that the british public has never collectively said `` let 's make a united states of europe '' , but churchill did . 
   plus , your union was intended to be a united states from the start , whereas the eu was not . 
  not really . 
  it was intended to be a confederation , like the eu presently is . 
  [ this was our first system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/articles_of_confederation ) . 
  it did n't work out too well , and [ then we federalized ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_constitution ) . 
  that worked better . 
   the current path towards federalization is built upon a bed of lies and corruption from the high-ups in brussels , the lisbon treaty being a prime example . 
  i * am * sympathetic to the idea that bureaucrats are driving this more than the public , but would also point out that legislators did the same in the us -- the colonies never held a popular referendum on creating a federal state . 
  well , via [ incorporation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incorporation_of_the_bill_of_rights ) , the constitution does have authority over state law , and federal courts do rule on constitutionality . 
  the us constitution is n't large -- far smaller than the eu proposed equivalent -- so the scope of direct authority is admittedly limited , but ... 
  if you 're counting dc as a state , the thing has a population on par with that of luxembourg , which has a higher per-capita gdp than dc . 
   but the refugee crisis has shown that the eu is completely unable to regulate its own borders and many britons do n't want to be a part of that . 
  is that a * fundamental * limitation of the eu , though ? 
  an unfixable issue ? 
  i mean , frontex is already being replaced with a more-capable institution . 
  the us had the initial central government more-or-less fail until the articles of confederation were replaced with the constitution . 
  brussels is n't doing * that * badly . 
  the us had its own migrant friction -- probably most-severe in the form of [ anti-chinese sentiment a century ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-chinese_sentiment_in_the_united_states#chinese_exclusion_act_and_legal_discrimination ) . 
  by that standard , things are awfully mellow in europe . 
  no , that 's true . 
  that being said , puerto rico is the only one of any size , and it 's not * that * far off , at $ 28,509 . 
  my guess is that were american samoa -- with just the population of a town -- to become a state and american samoans to become us citizens , the gdp-per-capita would also rise there . 
  ca n't imagine it happening , though , because of the amount of senate clout it would grant . 
  well ... let 's not turn it into a semantic argument . 
  in terms of the international and economy-of-scale benefits of having an eu , the uk is most-comparable to a us state , like a california ; it 's 150 % of california 's population , and 120 % of california 's gdp . 
  on the other hand , the largest concern i hear about eu membership seems to be intra-eu migration . 
  there were times even in the us when there has been resentment about internal us migration , like the [ `` okies '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okie ) moving to california when the great dust bowl formed , or [ carpetbaggers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carpetbagger ) after the american civil war . 
  the us hoping for the uk to vote in a popular referendum for freedom-of-movement-and-labor with poland , romania , and bulgaria is , in terms of relative population , language differences , and gdp-per-capita ratios , roughly-on-par with the us being asked to vote in a popular referendum to establish freedom-of-movement-and-labor with three mexicos ( 1:1 population ratio , different language , something like 4-6 to 1 per-capita-gdp ratio ) . 
  i 'm not going to lie -- i do n't think that that would pass , as there 'd be intense opposition in the us to such a popular referendum . 
  so , the comparison -- `` the us would n't do what it hopes the uk would do '' is not very apt in one sense , but apt in another sense . 
  and while the us might want to avoid an eu breakup , it 's also not as if the us has offered to put something concrete on the table to avoid it , either . 
  so from the uk 's standpoint , this is a `` we have skin in the game here , and you really do n't '' . 
  that being said , i * do * look at the collection of states in europe and at the us and think ( a ) that if europe wanted to , it could look like the us , and ( b ) that this would be advantageous for europe . 
  some people out there may not agree with ( a ) or ( b ) , but ... < shrug  . 
  that is , no us state , no matter how wealthy or self-sufficient , would be better-off were it to leave the us . 
  for me , that 's the long-term compelling argument for the uk to stay in the eu from the uk 's standpoint . 
   in ** english speaking country ** which has the same culture , ** hero 's ** , < winces , 
  i would be exceptionally-surprised if obama has some sort of personal dislike for people in the uk . 
   according to the official russian military doctrine we are enemies to russia . 
  what official doctrine are you referring to ? 
  oh , do n't get me wrong , i agree that russia and the eu are rivals , and that russia 's military probably does see a conflict in europe as one of the most-likely concerns , but why would the russian military be involved in determining enemies ? 
  it 's not as if the russian military is a loose canon outside of control of russia 's executive , running around making russia 's decisions on foreign relations . 
  if the civilian government in russia decided to pull a 180 and become best friends with the the eu , it 's not as if the military would overrule that . 
  yes , aquagirl , it does . 
   given america would never allow an international parliament based in canada to make laws for it , or for unlimited migration from latin america , you can fuck right off demanding we do the equivalent . 
  had we won in 1812 , us states that would have come from canada would have been member states in a federal union today with other us states , though . 
   the difference between massachussets and mississippi is bigger than between the uk and bulgaria . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_gdp_per_capita 2015 gdp per capita : massachusetts : $ 69,705 mississippi : $ 35,717 ratio : 1.95 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgaria 2015 estimate : $ 6,581 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom 2015 estimate : $ 43,770 ratio : 6.65, 
   the poorest american states make 1/5th the gdp per capita than the richest states . 
  what 's your source ? 
  that sounds way , way off . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_by_gdp_per_capita the highest state here is alaska , at $ 81,801 for 2015 . 
  the lowest state here is mississippi , at $ 35,717 for 2015 . 
   if we could set our own immigration policy , we could get the former without the latter . 
  i would imagine that a post-brexit uk would probably improve per-capita gdp . 
  but over time , as center of a larger economy , will a berlin or london become a more-desirable destination ? 
  would new york city do well if it were to wall out the rest of the world ? 
  political carrot which is always conveniently just-out-of-reach . 
   they just want stability no matter the cost . 
  if the middle east were to turn into a free-for-all , europe would probably be more-disadvantaged than the us . 
  just saying . 
   the us is luckily or not the world 's first superpower in terms of chronology , if it was n't china , i suspect that it was the british empire , actually . 
   and all have an almost identical standard of living subsequent to the establishment of that federal union , yeah , differences are smaller . 
   yet to get that stability he is demanding the uk accepts things the us never would : unrestricted immigration from much poorer neighbours and international courts overruling domestic law . 
  if you treat the uk as the us rather than , say , texas or california . 
  edit : though i will grant you that `` give mexico statehood '' would probably fail a us popular referendum , so there is that . 
   for what it 's worth the uk and the usa have been rivals longer than they 've been allies . 
  the us and the uk ( or , rather , the british empire ) were hostile in 1776 and 1812 . 
  the uk * could * have aided the csa , but did n't . 
  there have been disagreements -- the [ fenian raids ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fenian_raids ) , the [ suez crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis ) , the [ invasion of grenada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_grenada ) . 
  but the us and the uk have worked together much more than against each other since 1812 -- in terms of military actions and economic and political moves .
