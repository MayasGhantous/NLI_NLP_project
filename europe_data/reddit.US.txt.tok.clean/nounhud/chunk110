  [ centers for disease control and prevention : medical examination of immigrants and refugees ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/exams/medical-examination.html ) :  a medical examination is mandatory for all refugees coming to the u.s. and all applicants outside the u.s. applying for an immigrant visa . 
  [ centers for disease control and prevention : division of global migration and quarantine ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dgmq/feature-stories/welcoming-new-arrivals-protecting-us-heath.html ) :  with 1 billion people crossing international borders each year , there is nowhere in the world from which we are remote and no one from whom we are disconnected . 
  that is why the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention 's ( cdc ) quarantine stations , often called q-stations , are so important . 
  u.s. quarantine stations are part of a broad system that serves to limit the introduction and spread of infectious diseases into the united states . 
  but in europe , there are large numbers of people moving from third-world countries without undergoing examination or even being documented for epidemiology . 
  that 's a legitimate concern . 
  the baltic sea can [ apparently freeze over in really cold winters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_sea#the_ice ) . 
  i guess global warming is going to put a stop to that , though . 
  honestly , the `` montage of politicians at different times '' does n't really require a comedian to pull it off . 
  you need access to a footage library and basic video editing skills . 
  and it * is * kind of an effective way to make arguments ( though it does lose context , sadly enough ) . 
  if it came to that , it would probably be easier to declare an area closed to boat traffic , and then set up electronic sensors to monitor it .

  * both british and us english users seem to use `` first generation immigrant '' to refer to the person born overseas ; this is what i 'd expected . 
  * british used mostly `` first generation migrant '' and us english mostly `` first generation immigrant '' . 
  perhaps because the lawyers do n't want two years of jail time . 
  seriously , though , the statue in question seems to be [ article 299 of the turkish penal code ] ( http://www.tuerkeiforum.net/enw/index.php/translation_of_selected_articles_of_the_turkish_penal_code ) . 
  the english translation is :  insulting the president of the republic   article 299 - ( 1 ) anyone who insults the president of the republic shall be imprisoned for a term of from one to four years . 
  i do n't know whether turkish law treats truth as a defense for this crime -- that is , if the defendant can prove that the statement is true , he ca n't be punished . 
  ordinarily , i 'd vaguely-expect that it * would * , but if you look elsewhere in the turkish criminal code , at the vaguely-similar article 125 :  article 125 - ( 1 ) anyone who undermining the honour , dignity or respectability of another person or who attacks a person 's honour by attributing to them a concrete act or a fact , or by means of an insult shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three months to two years , or punished with a judicial fine . 
  in order to convict for an insult made in the absence of the victim , the act must have been witnessed by at least three persons . 
   ... specifically ...  a ) against a public official in connection with their duty ; however , for article 125 , there is an * explicit * article 127 granting that truth shall be a defense ; that does n't exist for article 299 , so i 'm suspicious that truth might * not * be a defense ... and 127 ( 2 ) sounds like it might be that even truth is n't a defense if there 's still an intent to insult :  proof of accusation   article 127 - ( 1 ) the act shall not be punishable if the allegation is proven . 
  the allegation is deemed to have been proven if the insulted person was convicted by a final judgment . 
  in other circumstances , the acceptance of the demand for proof of the allegation shall depend on whether there is a public benefit from the clarification of the truth or falsehood of the allegation , or on whether the complainant consents to proof thereof . 
    ( 2 ) a punishment shall be imposed on any person who insults an individual by reference to that individual 's proven act . 
  note that all of this may come off as incredibly thin-skinned to many of us ( `` it 's an * insult * . 
  calm down , for crying out loud . '' ) . 
  however , i know that at least places in the us once had laws that looked kind of like this : particularly in the south , there was a [ culture of honor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_of_honor_%28southern_united_states%29 ) , and laws that often reflected this . 
  in such a culture , an insult is a much more-severe statement than it 's typically seen as today . 
  being insulted and * not * responding violently would be seen as a serious sign of weakness . 
  as a result , laws had to be established to address this sort of thing ( in the us , for example , anti-dueling laws ) . 
  and those were controversial at the time : http://www.onevoter.org/2015/11/22/dueling-in-california/  `` no clause that you can introduce in the constitution will prevent a man from fighting a duel , if it be in defense of his honor . 
  there are few men who will not risk their lives when their honor is at stake . '' -- delegate louis dent , 1849 constitutional convention https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/family_honor#the_old_south  the old south took honor particularly seriously . 
  southerners in the old south held themselves to their own sets of social codes . 
  [ 48 ] an affront to a southerner 's honor , if serious enough , was resolved by a duel . 
  dueling was originally a european custom , later adopted by the united states . 
  [ 47 ] dueling was not technically legal in the united states , but it was difficult to enforce the laws written against it , especially in the old south . 
  [ 49 ] usually only men engaged in duels ; their opponents were men they perceived to be equals . 
  [ 48 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/family_honor#turkey  family honor is a highly valued concept known as [ namus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/namus ) in turkey ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/namus  the namus of a man is violated if , for example ... he tolerates an offense without reaction . 
  [ 2 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] it could be a legal structure designed to avoid people having to address insults violently , to avoid things like duels . 
  i 'm not familiar-enough with turkish culture to say , but it seems like this might be a case of cultural disconnection . 
  something that would only make sense in a dictatorship trying to block any form of political opposition in most of the current-day us or france or something like that might be an effort to address a cultural expectation to respond to insults oneself by moving the conflict to the judicial system . 
  that 's the peak level towards the end of this year . 
   most spaniards ca n't think of getting married , buying a house and starting a family until their mid to late 30s fertility [ also decreases with age ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/women-face-falling-off-fertility-cliff-edge-if-they-fail-conceive-before-age-38-1506511 ) , and that 's getting right up towards the point where fertility starts really falling off . 
   what is now illegal in reddit what does that even * mean * ? 
  i was going to say that your terminology was off , but apparently it 's another british english-american english difference . 
  [ in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/storey ) : the `` first floor '' of a building is the floor you enter . 
  the `` second floor '' is the one above that .

  the `` first floor '' is the one above that . 
  in the us : [ a first-generation immigrant is the generation that arrives on your shores ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigrant_generations ) . 
  their children are second-generation immigrants . 
  in the uk : a first-generation immigrant apparently refers to the child of people who immigrated . 
  no idea what the people who arrive on your shores are called ( `` zero-generation '' , i suppose ) . 
   this organised crime group is believed to have smuggled around 100 migrants per day and been active since 2013 . 
  wow . 
  if true , that 's a not-inconsiderable chunk of the total illegal immigration that happened .

  this shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states . 
    commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the north atlantic treaty organisation , which , for those states which are members of it , remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation . 
  if you feel that the amount of wiggle room that the treaty on the european union provides is insufficient to provide a defense guarantee , i 'd think that the north atlantic treaty would also provide too much wiggle room for you .

   why should france care about the us 's constitution ? 
  it 's not legally-applicable , but i 'm giving an example of why it 's such a big deal . 
  it 's possible for someone to have `` never been actually granted citizenship '' if they obtain citizenship under bogus grounds -- for example , if a pre-condition of getting us citizenship is that they not have been a member of the nazi party , and they say they were n't , and then a couple years later it comes out that they were . 
  in that case , the idea is that the citizenship had never been legitimately-granted in the first place . 
  the examples you 're referencing are all related to not actually properly-completing the naturalization process .

   let 's say that countries finally decide to demand us pays its debt , the us does pay its debt -- it does so whenever a bond matures .
