   many french terrorists have a history of petty crime that landed them in prison . 
  stays there often proved seminal experiences on their path to radicalization , says khosrokhavar , who spent several years interviewing some 160 staff and inmates at 4 large french prisons , including 15 inmates sentenced for terrorism offences . 
  he says that prisoners often come under the influence of -- and form lasting bonds with -- radical islamists and terrorist networks . 
  sounds like having special prisons to isolate said people or simply to increase isolation in prisons across-the-board would be a way of combating this , then . 
  i would . 
  turkey can come up with a million less-expensive justifications to block transit through the turkish straits that give it finer control if it actually wanted to do so . 
  < shrug  proof does n't need to rely on the speaker 's own reputation and authority . 
   while both sides have said they do not want to escalate the situation further , the abrasive personal styles of putin and turkish president recep tayyip erdo\u011fan are not proving conducive to rapprochement . 
  i do n't think i agree with the author here . 
  first , i doubt that the `` personal styles '' of the leadership of either country plays a huge role here -- i do n't think that countries are simply setting their international relations decision on a whim . 
  second , if anything , if the countries involved so desire , putin and erdogan might be particularly well-suited to smooth things over precisely * because * each has earned their nationalist spurs . 
  [ wikipedia : nixon goes to china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nixon_goes_to_china ) :  the phrase `` nixon goes to china '' , `` nixon to china '' , or `` nixon in china '' [ 1 ] is a historical reference to united states president richard nixon 's 1972 visit to the people 's republic of china , where he met with chairman mao zedong . 
  the metaphor is often expressed as the observation `` only nixon could go to china '' or `` it took nixon to go to china '' . 
    as a political metaphor , it refers to the ability of a politician with an unassailable reputation among his or her supporters for representing and defending their values to take actions that would draw their criticism and even opposition if taken by someone without those credentials . 
  although the example is that of a hardliner taking steps toward peace with a traditional enemy , and this is the most common application of the metaphor , it could also be applied to a reputedly cautious diplomat defying expectations by taking military action , or a political leader reforming aspects of the political system of which they have been strong supporters . 
  nixon played a role in the [ house un-american activities committee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_un-american_activities_committee ) and attacked people for being affiliated with communists . 
  a politician on the left side of the us political spectrum might fear dealing with communists in that it would open them up to political attacks from someone * like * nixon . 
  however , it would strain credulity to believe that nixon himself had communist sympathies ; paradoxically , he thus was a particularly-viable politician to cut deals with communist china , since doing so did n't leave him politically-vulnerable at home . 
  it rather seems like the same principle would be applicable here . 
   this does n't mean that the country has impunity from international law . 
  it does mean that your law enforcement and judicial arms of the government may not conform to it , though , which definitely is going to limit its influence . 
  that being said : * as far as i know , a country 's constitution normally trumps the degree to which the country considers itself bound to enforce international law . 
  i would have thought that this was the norm , frankly . 
  it might result in the country acting in conflict with the international community , but the whole point of a constitution is to be the highest law dictating a country 's actions . 
  * russia is most-definitely not the only country out there that rejects jurisdiction of international courts to greater or lesser degree ; for the us , [ * nicaragua v. united states * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicaragua_v._united_states ) is an example of refusing to accept international court authority . 
  / u/insanekodr1337omg is talking about bribes from companies in foreign countries , rather than the level of corruption in other countries . 
  i think that both of you would agree that france does n't suffer from relatively-bad levels of domestic corruption . 
   however , russians are the only force in the region which is making a concrete contribution to fighting isis um . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american-led_intervention_in_syria https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american-led_intervention_in_iraq_%282014%e2%80%93present%29 the us is opposed to assad too , so if your definition of `` fighting isis '' is `` supporting russian allied regimes '' , yeah , that 's not fighting isis . 
   european terrorism needs to be countered by a european anti-terrorism agency , national governments can not fix this by themselves . 
  whether-or-not that is the case , surely this incident would be viewed as a success for mi5 ? 
   brussels is frustrated by athens ' reluctance to accept humanitarian aid for border areas where there is an influx of migrants , if this is a euphemism for `` permanently settle people in greece to keep them from heading elsewhere in the eu instead of just letting them head north '' , i 'm not terribly-surprised . 
   and to improve its registration system for refugees . 
  i 'm not going to argue for quotas , but whatever solution the eu produces can not , i would say , be `` dump problems on specifically greece/other border countries '' , because greece is n't going to sign on to that . 
   would n't it solve the problem if nato got together and made better arrangements for who can let their planes fly in who 's airspace ? 
  it 's not a point of confusion , and there have already been attempts at diplomatic resolution . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegean_dispute nato probably is n't the right forum for that , anyway . 
  nato 's not in the business of forcing territorial resolutions on members . 
  it would n't be an attack on the country * and * it would be two nato members in the scenario described . 
  all that being said , this really does n't seem to be particularly diplomatically-ept , turkey . 
  if some people want to go wage ideological fights about human rights as abstract concerns , that 's up to them . 
  i certainly do n't object to them doing that . 
  my own concerns here are rather more pragmatic . 
  if one country in the world is doing something else to another country in the world -- say , two countries in sub-saharan africa fighting over something -- it has a limited impact on me . 
  on the other hand , i do care about what my country is doing , since it impacts my country not just in terms of its direct effects , but in the form of whether-or-not there will be upset people down the line to deal with . 
  similarly , if a country is doing something that could only be done because it is enabled by my country , a similar situation arises . 
  what about them ? 
  edit : if your concern is that you do n't like me equating them with rt , or sputnik fine : i think that rt is willing to stretch further into outright dishonesty ( moreso than voa too , for that matter ) . 
  but all of those exist because the national government in question sees there being value in setting international opinion . 
   no matter what is your position on the eu you know it currently does n't work well anymore , politically , geopolitically , in terms of security i think that eu members are doing pretty well from a global standpoint . 
   us eusceptics across the north sea will be following this referendum very closely . 
  that conflicts with what the article stated :  what would it mean for europe ? 
    not much , which can be measured by the foreign media 's lack of interest . 
  not even the british press , which usually looks for euroskeptic trends , has covered the referendum with any gusto so far . 
  are you representative of the danish population on this , though ? 
  i mean , my guess is that the danish political parties spend great time and effort determining what will best-influence voters , and i 'd expect that they 're fairly good at it . 
   the parties in favor of a yes vote say the referendum is mainly about denmark 's membership of europol , which they say is crucial for the country 's ability to fight crime , pedophilia and terrorism across borders . 
  when i see pedophilia and terrorism in conjunction in a discussion about law enforcement powers , i develop an awfully-big chunk of skepticism . 
  that combination was used as a justification for a lot of less-than-well-justified policies in the us after 9/11 . 
  if the policy is a good idea , give me a serious rationale . 
  that 's a thought , and if a hospital 's sufficiently-funded ( and i do n't know what things look like in ukraine today ) , they may well , but i believe that that 's intended for short-term power outages , not permanently-replacing access to the electrical grid . 
  the [ us has had problems with hospital backup systems functioning ] ( https://www.propublica.org/article/why-do-hospitals-generators-keep-failing ) before . 
  looking online , it looks like us hospitals with generators typically have fuel for a day or two of generator operation . 
  while they could probably arrange for shipments in the longer term , that does kinda support a suspicion on my part that the generators may not be intended for permanent use . 
  maybe . 
  a couple points , though : * it looks like the [ agm-86 alcm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agm-86_alcm ) is where the bulk of the cuts in nuclear warhead count are being directed . 
  i suspect that that means that it 's viewed as being less-critical by us military planners . 
  * a lot of the [ b-2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northrop_grumman_b-2_spirit ) unit cost is going to be amortized r&d costs , because there were only a few ever produced , whereas the [ b-52 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_b-52_stratofortress ) was produced in much larger numbers . 
  the marginal cost of production of another b-2 probably is n't as high as the unit cost would suggest . 
  * some of it may be political . 
  i am not familiar with us military politics on this point , but the us air force was the most-critical us strategic nuclear weapon wielder for a long time . 
  today , the navy has eaten into that with slbms . 
  icbms are air force , but at the end of the day , they consist of a couple guys sitting in a hole in the ground somewhere , not airplanes flying around actually doing things . 
  i 'm a little suspicious ( though i 'm no expert ) that the real interest in the b-52 is as an economical conventional heavy bomber , particularly after the cold war ended . 
  letting it provide a nuclear role might be another selling point for it in terms of being funded , but ... 
  it gets the united nations security council seat . 
  probably means that treaties signed with the soviet union remain in force with russia but not other states that came out of the ussr . 
  i imagine that you can dig up a list somewhere of all the legal implications . 
   in the us the b52s are still a cornerstone of their national nuclear deterrence i dunno how important it still is compared to icbms and slbms , but it 's still a reliable plane for hauling large loads of conventional bombs somewhere once air defenses have been suppressed . 
  fatah and hamas do n't act with our backing . 
  what they do does n't reflect on the us . 
   that 's an unbalanced economic situation that should never arise in a capitalistic society in a market economy . 
  capitalism just deals with who owns industry . 
   the recruiters said : `` there are guys from the baltics who get paid even five thousand dollars , not even the european bureaucrats get such salaries . '' might be true , but bureaucratic life wo n't put you in an unmarked grave or maim you , and the career is going to last more than a year or so . 
  hmm . 
  the longest-running member of the us senate until he died in office a couple of years ago , [ robert c. byrd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_byrd ) , was a member of the kkk back in the days when the kkk was an actual thing . 
  probably also increases infant mortality . 
   we 've had our share of airspace violations by russians and never had to shoot anyone down . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war  ussr : casualties and losses : aircraft   261-515 aircraft i 'm pretty sure that you 've shot down more russian aircraft than any other european country except for germany or * possibly * some other axis member . 
  probably more than any other european country if you limit it to airspace violations : germany was doing a lot of fighting in soviet territory . 
  that 's our schtick , uk . 
  donkeys are smaller than horses . 
  one wonders whether the benefits of widespread government monitoring of even such esoteric public communication as in-game video game speech outweigh the costs . 
  now control for obesity . 
  maybe . 
  my guess is that both turkey and russia have international relations people who have recommended specific responses , that those actions are n't just the personal whims of either president . 
  remember that both have to deal with domestic appeal as well -- they are acting for many different audiences at once . 
  i suspect that the us has a fair amount of radar/satellite/etc data on syria . 
   turkey should have never been a part of nato . 
  nato keeps turkey from being overwhelmed , and turkey provides valuable control of the mediterranean .
