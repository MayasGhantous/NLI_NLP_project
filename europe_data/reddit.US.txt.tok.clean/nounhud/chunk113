  i 'd say that it 's a good deal for both sides . 
  awwwww ... 
  i 'm not following . 
  you mean that the driver needs to leave the cab and do something that they otherwise would n't have ? 
  i have a hard time betting against automation of trucking in the next decade or so . 
  communism is pretty dead as an ideology , but russia funds rt and sputnik , germany dw , france france24 , the us voice of america and radio free liberty , and so forth . 
  those all attempt to influence people in other countries . 
  hmm . 
  have you ever criticized the policies of another country ? 
  zig-zag across the border . 
  could do it with a single flight . 
   americans have been slow to grasp that europe 's familiar , centrist , european union-centered political order is endangered . 
  to the extent that the general us public has awareness of eu political order , i suspect that it would be viewed as center-left . 
   if you ca n't retake the falklands with the combined might of europe attacking an island actually requires a substantial degree of specialization if you do n't want to get mauled in the process , not just numbers . 
  first , unless you have a land base nearby ( and the uk has many overseas islands for which this is not the case ) , it 's possible for the other side to have aircraft based on the island . 
  unless you have an aircraft carrier , these aircraft will be dangerous for any naval force attacking the islands : they 'll have a longer range than you will . 
  in the falklands war , the primary concern of the british was that the argentinians might manage to sink their aircraft carriers , which would leave them in a very bad place -- the us wound up secretly promising to turn over one of its helicopter carriers to the uk if the uk lost a carrier . 
  second , an [ amphibious operation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amphibious_warfare ) can be hard even with aerial superiority and after known defenses have been attacked . 
  it 's hard to retreat from , has little cover , forces the invaders to pass through predictable areas , and limits the equipment that can be used . 
  the [ us and the uk in exercise tiger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exercise_tiger#friendly_fire_incident ) , the [ us on omaha beach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omaha_beach ) , the [ us at koh tang ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mayaguez_incident ) , or the [ canadians at dieppe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dieppe_raid ) show a lot of room for things to go very badly . 
  to defend uk ( and to a lesser extent , french ) posessions , aircraft carriers are pretty important ; to all other eu members , they are of very limited use . 
  i think that the uk saying `` we want to make sure that our possessions are protected in the long run '' is a legitimate concern . 
  it may not be a `` there should absolutely not be a european army '' argument , but it 's a real issue . 
  would the eu as a whole choose to trade possessions to avoid bloody amphibious operations ? 
  if there 's risk of that , the uk is probably going to want some sort of guarantees about this . 
  it has more people than germany . 
  that same table has `` immigrants as percentage of national population '' , and russia is n't particularly high on the table as that goes . 
   we also have a good reason to fear handing over our defence to nations who we have good historical reasons to believe produced sailors of inferior skill to our own . 
  and the trash-talking begins !, 
  i think that immigrants-per-capita might be a more-interesting metric . 
  russia is a fairly large country . 
  i doubt that -- i 'd say that he regretted sending out the tweet at all . 
  my comment was on the retraction . 
   the best way to turn a country into a failed state , is to bash it at every turn as being a failed state . 
  i 'm pretty sure that , say , a decade-long civil war is better at turning a country into a failed state than someone bashing it . 
   because they 're the cheap areas near a city with lots of perceived opportunity . 
  yet nothing has changed , the area stayed poor . 
  note that while i 'm not saying that this is the case here , that 's not he same thing as people in the area staying poor . 
  people could be steadily transiting out . 
  for example , you could maybe say that most college students are kinda poor , but obviously no one student just stays in college . 
  i do n't use twitter . 
  nor do i have plans to do so . 
  but if i were a user , and if i reached a high elected office , i 'm pretty sure that the first thing i 'd do is hand over that account to whoever runs my pr for the duration of my time in office , so that i do n't even have access to it . 
  the service is a most-effective way to let knee-jerk reactions be broadcast to terrific numbers of people . 
   does n't mean anything if you ca n't contribute shit to the union , closes off one of the two non-nato mediterranean sea borders ( the other being a tiny segment of bosnia and herzegovina that presently has no freight port ) , i guess . 
  fair-enough !, 
  the article i 'd read saying that the us reserved the possibility of turning it back on was well before that , dating to when the error was first removed . 
  hmm . 
  i 'd say that putin really did n't raise the stakes much . 
  he did n't attack anything . 
  he moved a ship and stated that bombers would be escorted by fighters in the future . 
  he was n't going to completely ignore it , just due to political reasons . 
  there are things that he could potentially have done that would have been much more-dramatic , like applying economic pressure ( above and beyond the may-or-may-not be related tourist recommendation ) or declaring parts of syria a no-fly zone . 
  i suspect that a lot of these are over things like visa violations , not necessarily conspiring to set up the attacks . 
  by that standard , ukraine must be a shoe-in . 
  without going through the whole list , burundi ? 
  why would russia lie about extracting the navigator ? 
  you 're missing members contributing police personnel in your list of countries . 
  i [ added a link to the list above ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3u77nf/germany_to_send_up_to_650_soldiers_to_mali/cxch1a1 ) . 
   only countries that contribute to minusma https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minusma/facts.shtml military personnel :  bangladesh , benin , bhutan , bosnia and herzegovina , burkina faso , cambodia , cameroon , chad , china , c\u00f4te d'ivoire , denmark , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , egypt , el salvador , estonia , finland , france , gambia , germany , ghana , guinea , guinea-bissau , indonesia , italy , jordan , kenya , liberia , madagascar , mauritania , nepal , netherlands , niger , nigeria , norway , portugal , romania , rwanda , senegal , sierra leone , sweden , switzerland , togo , tunisia , turkey , united kingdom , united states and yemen . 
  police personnel :  benin , burundi , cameroon , chad , c\u00f4te d'ivoire , djibouti , democratic republic of congo , france , germany , ghana , guinea , jordan , madagascar , netherlands , niger , nigeria , romania , rwanda , senegal , sweden , togo , tunisia , turkey and yemen . 
  i disagree . 
  a country does not need to ever let a military aircraft violating its airspace walk out of that airspace . 
  it might be a good idea to let a violation slide , but once it has wandered in , it 's fair game . 
  there 's no requirement that the aircraft in particular pose a threat to the country in general : airspace control means airspace control . 
  that 's what nato 's for . 
  if you do n't think that the us would risk war over turkey , then you presumably also do n't think that the us would honor its nato commitments to italy . 
  the first link is rt , which i 'd say has been pushing rather hard to overstate china 's involvement . 
  i doubt that china will want to become tied up here . 
  china does n't have any major interests here , and becoming deeply involved on russia 's side might well hurt things that china * does * care about . 
  walk softly and carry a big stick ? 
   what kind of limp wristed , ultra passive and meek message is that ? 
  presumably , they 've talked to a number of refugees , and have probably been able to identify what misinformation was most-compelling in sending people to europe . 
  the main point of the billboard is to catch someone 's attention and send them to the website , which will contain the actual information . 
  i do n't know whether europe has sufficient natural gas supply for that . 
  ukraine [ used 53.16 bcm/year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_gas_in_ukraine ) in 2010 . 
  gazprom [ provided 162bcm/year ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/europe-unprepared-if-russia-cuts-natural-gas-exports-eu-summer-analysts-say-1643986 ) to europe in 2013 , a third of europe 's consumption . 
  lithuania opened a [ liquified natural gas terminal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klaip%c4%97da_lng_fsru ) recently . 
  that was a big deal , and can do [ 4bcm/year ] ( http://www.energypost.eu/system-unconnected-vessels-gas-market-baltic-states/ ) , enough for `` 80 % of the demand for gas in all of the baltics '' . 
  that could lug in gas from norway or the us or other natural gas providers if need be ( albeit with shipping overhead ) , but the capacity is obviously nowhere near what 's required to provide ukraine with energy independence . 
  there is probably also some unused lng terminal capacity elsewhere in europe . 
  i do n't know whether europe can reduce natural gas consumption , increase production ( hydrofracking ) , pull in natural gas from outside sources , and so forth sufficiently to fully take up the slack . 
  additionally , it would definitely be more-expensive for ukraine than russian natural gas . 
  i * am * guessing that ukraine could probably manage substantially-reduced gas consumption ( shutting down buildings and moving people together ) to buy time to bring other sources online , but it would hurt . 
  edit : [ here 's a list of existing lng terminals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_lng_terminals ) . 
  there are certainly other terminals listed here around europe . 
  while the sum of these might be sufficient , i do n't know how much of their capacity is actually unused . 
  [ that club is getting crowded ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_airliner_shootdown_incidents ) . 
  lots of countries have done that , [ including us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655 ) . 
  i 'm not following . 
  turkey presumably did establish policy to shoot if there was a violation detected , but there 's nothing illicit about that -- countries are permitted to shoot aircraft that violate their airspace . 
  sure , and that 's politically-awkward for erdogan , but it does n't affect international law . 
  the us currently does not introduce intentional error to the unencrypted signals , but that is a policy decision , not a technical limitation . 
  the reason that other major powers have constructed their own systems ( russia 's [ glonass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glonass ) , china 's [ beidou ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beidou_navigation_satellite_system ) , india 's [ irnss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_regional_navigation_satellite_system ) , and the eu 's [ galileo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galileo_%28satellite_navigation%29 ) ) rather than just using gps is to establish independence of needing to rely on gps and the fact that error could be introduced at any time or service simply cut to an area . 
   the point is that 1.36 miles and 17 seconds in terms of the speed of a jet plane is not much more than a rounding error . 
  it 's not a * large * violation , but it is a violation , and the line is drawn at the border . 
  if you 're operating a very fast aircraft , it places the responsibility on you to either have navigational systems or procedures that can keep it within the constraints that you 've agreed to : you could have a self-imposed buffer zone to account for error , or you could have fancy computer flight control that prevents the aircraft from flying into a country 's airspace , or you could accept the risk that you may be shot at , or you could negotiate an agreement to permit entry into the airspace -- but that 's russia 's responsibility , not turkey 's . 
  it might be in turkey 's interest to have simply let russia get away with this -- everyone showing a bit of flexibility can make life a lot easier for everyone , and i doubt taking down one russian fighter/bomber is going to substantially degrade russian ability to attack the fsa -- but that would still be turkey deciding to gift russia with something . 
  they did n't do so . 
   i do n't really know , but whoever fired that missile bought a bigger problem than they bargained for .
