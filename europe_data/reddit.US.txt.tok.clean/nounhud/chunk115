  if all members were capable of imposing sufficient security and there was no need for one member to provide/fund security resources for use in another area that impacts them , you could operate without a standard security service . 
  it does seems like having a common service would tend to let member states move people where they 're most-needed , though . 
  maybe so , but it does n't matter wrt isis : the eu is quite capable of dealing with isis and setting up an occupation alone . 
  the bulk of this article is based around the idea that the french military has few resources relative to the us military , and that this will shape its involvement in syria . 
  i 'm not sold on this . 
  france will potentially be bringing the other eu militaries with it , which rather changes the potential shape of what france might do . 
   the french military abhors mission creep and want no part in things such as `` nation building . '', 
  maybe . 
  france ran syria before , as well as a number of other places around the world . 
   whereas the u.s. military tends toward a `` go big or go home '' approach to war -- american planners arguably take for granted their ability to marshal vast resources and firepower -- the french military embraces `` going '' small . 
  except that this has n't really happened for the us in syria , which has been kept limited in scope . 
   the french military 's self-awareness with respect to its limitations helps it to work well with the united states [ blah blah france likes working with the us etc ] i 'm not sure that i agree with that , either . 
  one reason to invoke the eu 's mutual defense clause instead of nato might be specifically because france wants to work independently of the us . 
  i 'm assuming that [ raf akrotiri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raf_akrotiri ) is n't much further away from syria than any carriers would be . 
  that 's part of it , but what about stuff like health care , where the retired elderly tend to be net beneficiaries and the young workers net losers ? 
  according to the article 's polls , yes . 
  britons are more-interested in ca/au/nz interchange than us ( people in the us are also more-interested in ca/au interchange than uk ) , but in both cases , there 's more support than opposition .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anonymous_%28group%29  on february 10 , thousands of anonymous joined simultaneous protests at church of scientology facilities around the world . 
  [ 51 ] many protesters wore the stylized guy fawkes masks popularized by the graphic novel and movie v for vendetta , in which an anarchist revolutionary battles a totalitarian government ; the masks soon became a popular symbol for anonymous . 
   after all , 9/11 was not perpetrated by muslim americans . 
  no , although the ( failed ) [ curtis culwell center attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curtis_culwell_center_attack ) were . 
   our economy is so integrated ... that it 's quite unlikely . 
  on the other hand , the same argument was used [ in 1910 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_illusion ) , and there were two world wars based in europe after that . 
  given that anonymous was modeled after the masses from the anarchist * v for vendetta * , the idea of members of it acting to uphold law-and-order against terrorist groups fighting the state is somewhat ironic . 
   if the party members voted for him why is it that the party is losing supporters left and right ? 
  you could win a plurality of voters from a party . 
  that 's enough to get you in . 
  you could simultaneously have those who do not support you in that party * strongly * disagree with your policies , so much that they would prefer another party if you became leader . 
  based on this , it would be a good idea for terrorists to make as many people as possible in france feel personally-threatened . 
  he appears to have changed his flair to an eu flair , oddly-enough . 
   he has questioned the use of deadly force against the paris terrorists so what was he proposing police be doing ? 
  hmm ... looks like he [ reversed himself on that point after being clobbered over it ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy_corbyn/12000003/jeremy-corbyn-savaged-by-labour-mps-over-shoot-to-kill-opposition.html ) . 
   `` often angry turkish demonstrators mistake us for our close neighbors ( russian consulate ) . like tonight , throwing eggs , '' dutch consul general robert schuddeboom wrote on his twitter account , sharing a photo of the protesters at the consulate 's gates . 
  if confusion between the two embassies is * that * much of an ongoing issue , putting a big netherlands flag up would presumably clear it up . 
  this is the opposite of the us : after 9/11 , us firearm sales substantially increased . 
  in fact , [ after the paris attacks and the threats against the us , us firearm sales and concealed carry permits are up again ] ( http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/9458288-74/monday-county-office ) . 
  i do n't have any * problem * with it , but it seems like it would hammer the uk welfare system without changes to the uk taxation system : someone in the uk could just go to the us , work , and then retire to the uk and draw benefits out of the uk tax base . . 
  i guess he could propose a law to change the ban . 
  it did n't seem very likely that russia would be enthusiastic about it ... 
  non-kurdish turkey probably is n't really-enthusiastic about people fighting for the pkk . 
  think of how , say , the uk would have felt if people were coming from country x to fight with the ira . 
  they probably would n't be really happy if country x was knowingly letting people jump in . 
  if germany is involved in combat , looking at their inventory pages on wikipedia for what would be directly-relevant to combat : ** [ anti-ground combat aircraft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_air_force#aircraft_inventory ) ** * they have 87 fighter-bomber [ tornados ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panavia_tornado ) * 117 [ typhoon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurofighter_typhoon ) multirole fighters , which can handle bombs and air-to-surface missiles . 
  ** [ ground combat vehicles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_modern_equipment_of_the_german_army ) ** * 250 [ leopard 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopard_2 ) main battle tanks * artillery : 50 [ m270 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m270_multiple_launch_rocket_system ) mlrses , 154 [ pzh 2000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panzerhaubitze_2000 ) self-propelled guns * however many of their 350 [ puma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puma_%28ifv%29 ) ifvs have been completed by that point . 
  * 272 [ wiesel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiesel_awc ) tankettes * 34 [ eurocopter tiger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurocopter_tiger ) attack helicopters * the 179k-man * bundeswehr * , which will contain some chunk of infantry . 
  they also have reconaissance , transport , and other capabilities important to having a military operate . 
  time spent learning a less-applicable language instead of fine-turning another ? 
  that 's not the meaning that a gunsmith or a military officer would use , though . 
  instead of constantly-asking for exceptions , would it make more sense to revise the rules in broader terms to be more-compatible with needs ? 
  for example , would it make sense to say `` the five-year-running-average needs to be at x '' . 
  russia and china do n't want terrorism targeting their nationals any more than anyone else . 
  besides , it 's good domestic and foreign politics to say something . 
  any degree to which it impacts the coalition over ukraine is frosting on the cake for russia -- not , i would think , the primary goal . 
   i too wonder more why people are decide to come here in winter instead of staying in the warmer parts of europe ... do they not realize how damn cold it is going to get , or are they optimistic that they will get supplied with housing ? 
  :( sweden gives permanent residency to syrians ; other places in europe do n't . 
  if you go to sweden , you wo n't ever have to leave europe . 
   paul 's proposal would undermine the purpose of the program , which is to make travel more efficient for citizens of allied countries and to allow those countries to share intelligence information , said jonathan grella , executive vice president of public affairs for the u.s. travel association . 
  i 'm going to go out on a limb and say that grella 's primary concern is n't sharing intelligence . 
  sure , i do n't dispute that the us sent weapons into the middle east that ended up with isis -- even more-directly when a number of iraqi army forces fled and left weapons behind . 
  but i take issue with the claim that the us was trying to direct aid to isis : you would n't say that churchill was supplying the nazis in world war ii because british supply dumps were captured in north africa . 
  8:00 : `` going into iraq added fuel to a fire . '', 
  9:34 : `` there is the possibility of establishing a salifist regime . '', 
  yes , in the context of this being a potential risk . 
  this does n't show that the us intended to arm isis . 
  clark video : this also is n't saying that the us is arming isis . 
  so the extent of this support is that you 're theorizing that because arms intended for one group , and which the article that you are citing says was intended for these and which the us was sending officials out to redirect away from them , wound up with isis , means that the us must be intending this to happen ? 
  the saudi government is fighting an iranian-backed group in yemen . 
  saudi arabia is not isis . 
  could you provide a specific link that you feel supports the statement `` us indirectly supports isis via arms '' ? 
  it 's hard to evaluate the reputability of everything on the internet that might come up . 
   us indirectly supports isis via arms .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/handcuffs#escaping  another common method of escaping ( or attempting to escape ) from being handcuffed behind the back , is that one would , from a sitting or lying position , bring one 's legs up as high upon one 's torso as possible , then push one 's arms down to bring the handcuffs below one 's feet , finally pulling the handcuffs up using one 's arms to the front of one 's body . 
  this can lead to awkward or painful positions depending on how the handcuffs were applied , and typically requires a good amount of flexibility . 
  honestly , the [ apc and ifvs that lithuania does have ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_land_force ) would make a lot more sense than a tank against some guy running around with a rifle .

  that 's because russia * denied * it and blamed it on an increasingly-unlikely set of alternative scenarios . 
  if russia had said `` yeah , russian sam hit it , unfortunate casualty of war , our condolences '' , i 'm pretty sure that it would have been pretty much done and over with . 
  if instead , ukrainian fighter jets are blamed in a false-flag attack , then you ca n't complain about debunkers making the news . 
  i really think that the russian response on that was just dumb from a diplomatic standpoint . 
  http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-ukraine-and-russia-matter-to-commodity-markets-2014-03-07  `` ukraine is known as the breadbasket of eastern europe and is one of the largest exporters of grain in the world , of which wheat exports would be the largest agricultural commodity impacted by an escalating conflict between kiev and moscow , '' said edmund moy , strategist with gold-backed ira provider morgan gold , who spent time in ukraine and lectured at kiev university . 
  i 'm skeptical . 
  there have been many wars around the world from which refugees were not accepted . 
  in the case of the holocaust : * it was given a high profile , since it was politically-useful in condemning nazism and establishing a moral justification for social change . 
  * it was an issue happening right in civilized europe , where people did n't think that mass executions would show up . 
  * jews were not some distant people ; while certainly there were people who objected to them , it was n't the same one people that one has never heard of killing another people that one has never heard of in a civil war in a country where one knows little more than its name .
