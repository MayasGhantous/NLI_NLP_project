  [ 31 ] [ us nuclear doctrine forbids this , as long as the state is not a nuclear power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_first_use#united_states ) :  `` the united states will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the npt and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations . 
   daesh has hit 4 of the 5 continents worldwide . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continent#separation_of_continents  north america and south america are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model . 
  however , they may also be viewed as a single continent known as america or the americas . 
  this viewpoint was common in the united states until world war ii , and remains prevalent in some asian six-continent models . 
  [ 12 ] this remains the more common vision in latin american countries , spain , portugal , france , italy and greece , where they are taught as a single continent . 
  and  the six-continent combined-america model is used in france and its former colonies , italy , portugal , spain , romania , latin america , [ 28 ] greece , [ 19 ] and some other parts of europe . 
  if you 're french , do n't you use the six-continent model ? 
  * one is drafted when one is forcibly added to the military ; this is different from volunteering . 
  * how does this add to the conversation ? 
  it says `` everyone , i associate with the left wing and dislike french right-wing voters '' . 
  if you really wanted to make that point , you could just say this , sans the unpleasantness . 
  * there 's been no public french referendum on this position ; right-wing french voters have had no direct input . 
  this was hollande 's decision , and he is from the french center-left . 
   [ about 80 percent of the jobs in the military are non-combat occupations . 
  ] ( http://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/military-myths.html ) in a war , the bulk of the military is n't actually fighting . 
  [ `` and this time ... it 's legal . 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsjvgshk0f0&amp;t=32s ), 
   we have combat advisors on the ground to call in air strikes and special ops on the ground . 
  officially , it 's no combat troops . 
  claiming that someone calling in airstrikes is n't a combat soldier is pushing the definition of the word . 
  i do n't know . 
  the us is already bombing isis , and has unloaded the most bombs on them . 
  the question of whether boots-on-the-ground are the best move is one of tactics , rather than response or lack thereof . 
   `` people have to understand that we 're talking about an internal and external war that should last decades , here . '', 
  france , you off re-collecting your colonies ? 
  libya and syria both have an isis presence and france has been decidedly-enthusiastic about involvement in both places ... 
  yeah , but right now , the coalition members in syria already have the ability to kill off whoever they want whenever they want without anyone on the ground having ability to hit back . 
  putting people on the streets will mean that rifles and other weapons available to the forces there will be usable against them . 
  i 'm not actually sure how the north atlantic treaty is supposed to be interpreted here . 
  it * does * seem that nato members would n't want to support a war of aggression , where a nato member clobbers someone and then nato is expected to defend them against a response . 
  but i do n't see any explicit exception for `` unless that country started it '' : http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm  article 5   the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that , if such an armed attack occurs , each of them , in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by article 51 of the charter of the united nations , will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . 
    any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the security council . 
  such measures shall be terminated when the security council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security . 
  so even if france attacked first , i do n't think that it exempts other members from being bound to respond if article 5 is invoked . 
  to be fair , the [ us homeland security advisory system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homeland_security_advisory_system ) never actually made it down to `` guarded '' . 
  given that it did n't really provide actionable data to the public , a number of people , including myself , felt that the purpose of the thing was primarily to whip up public concern and thus support for the administration 's actions . 
  i 've rather suspected that the european equivalents served a somewhat-similar role . 
  invoking et 42-7 rather than nato article 5 might be intentional for a number of reasons . 
  guessing : * france was historically the european power probably most-concerned about us influence in nato , and she might see this as a good opportunity to kick off a more-cohesive european military effort with itself as a driving core . 
  in particular , in an eu military operation , * france * will probably be the leader due to having the most ( or second-most , maybe ) military clout ; in a nato operation , the us is going to be the 800lb gorilla . 
  with russia , lugging in the us might be necessary or extremely helpful , but the eu can stomp syria without issues . 
  if it does , this will be the eu 's first war -- history is being written . 
  * there is n't actually much difference between bringing in the eu and bringing in nato at this point , due to most of the non-eu nato firepower already being involved . 
  the us and canada are already fighting anyway . 
  turkey is kind-of-involved anyway and an article 5 declaration might , as / u/thorbee points out , be politically-awkward for turkey . 
  iceland has no real military . 
  norway might be nice to bring in , but she 's not a heavy military hitter . 
  * the us has been somewhat-unenthusiastic about supporting french/british post-colonial adventures in africa and the levant ( suez crisis , dragged feet for a while on sending us military into libya ) . 
  if france wants to come in and establish a new syrian government or make more-profound changes , this might permit her more freedom to do what she wants . 
   it 's senseless to have it if you have a functioning social system . 
  at least in the us , the bulk of those begging [ have substance abuse issues ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/03/should-you-give-money-to-homeless-people/72820/ ) :  one report from the department of housing and urban development found that six out of ten homeless respondents admitted problems with alcohol or drugs . 
  given the likelihood of self-reported bias , the actual number could be even higher . 
  if the only non-criminal way that someone is reasonably going to provide for whatever addiction they have is begging -- if welfare is n't going to provide it and particularly if their addiction interferes with their ability to work -- they 're likely going to beg . 
   i would like to add that over 20 million unemployed young european people . 
    where is support for them ? 
  i do n't think that that 's going to be addressed via immigration policy . 
  if you have countries guarantee certain wages or benefits to someone in a field -- perhaps via unionized wage-setting -- and the market wage for some of those people is below that level , they are n't going to be employed . 
  [ `` explaining european unemployment '' ] ( https://www.nber.org/reporter/summer04/blanchard.html ) :  looking more closely at some of the `` unemployment miracles , '' in particular the dramatic decline in unemployment in the netherlands , i concluded that the large wage moderation did not come so much from changes in institutions as from the behavior of unions , which had become convinced that wage moderation was key to a decrease in unemployment . 
  it appeared that dutch unions had accepted the argument by firms that they needed to reestablish profit margins in order to increase employment . 
  this led me to explore , with thomas philippon , the role of trust between capital and labor in the evolution of unemployment . 
  ( 8 ) that paper found that you can have more-heavily-regulated labor ( as is more-common in europe ) and still have low unemployment , but if so , unions need to be willing to reduce wages . 
  whether-or-not that 's the case , i assume that you 're not saying that it 's related to the article ? 
  it 's not great , but how is it terrifying ? 
  lots of places in the world have beggars everywhere -- in fact , i 'd go so far as to say that unless you make it illegal to beg , you 'll almost certainly wind up with * some * people begging . 
   ... in doing so you can lose your citizenship . 
  this was also the case in the us until [ * afroyim v. rusk * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afroyim_v._rusk ) . 
  if you fight against the us , you 're still guilty of treason ... but a citizen guilty of treason , not a foreign national . 
  this is n't some sort of condemnation of the eu . 
  i 'm just saying that from russia 's standpoint , the eu is competing with it :  russia does not want shared power , it wants absolute power . 
  that may well be true , but then russia not being able to have absolute power is a way in which there 's competition for countries . 
  ah , okay , you do n't just mean `` they 're old '' but `` they do n't have the resources to run '' ; misunderstanding on my part . 
   this is why islam conquered 1/4 of the world , and judaism conquered badically nothing . 
  i would have said that it was because judaism was tied to a particular tribe historically , and most other religions ( including islam and christianity ) were n't . 
  and let 's say that you * did n't * have a conqueror for a founder , which christianity did n't . 
  that does n't prevent the religion , during a more war-prone era , from being used as a basis to wage war . 
  christianity went through , what , [ nine crusades ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crusades ) ? 
  [ joshua ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joshua ) was a prophet and conquered canaan under the banner of judaism for god , or at least this is the religious take on it . 
  i think that the real issue is more that if you go back some hundreds of years , religion * was * tightly bound up with tribalism and conquest . 
  the issue is the degree to which modern people have rewritten a religion to excise that ( or to which they 've returned to the original forms of the doctrine , in the case of fundamentalism ) . 
  i would assume that there are pre-planned responses to `` major terrorism incident '' in place . 
  for example , when a major incident happens , out comes a huge wad of `` more surveillance '' legislation . 
  that does n't get written overnight -- it 's stuff that 's been accumulating on a wishlist for the time to be right , when it can come out . 
   a leader of shia terrorist organization condemns actions of sunni terrorist organizationd which is known to target shia people and the shia organization in question ? 
  isis is also in opposition to many of the other countries which expressed solidarity with france . 
  do you feel the same way about those statements ? 
  the eu is a competitor for power . 
  same thing could be said about , say , traditional judaism and modern judaism . 
  i do n't think that islam is particularly unique among religions here . 
  i think that there 's already a limited attempt along those lines . 
  if you 'll notice , us government sources use the terms `` isis '' for `` islamic state in iraq and syria '' or `` isil '' for `` islamic state of iraq and the levant . 
  this intentionally denies isis as having the status of a worldwide caliphate ( which `` is '' , `` islamic state '' , would permit for ) . 
  an end to the eu would be advantageous to russia . 
   our 35 year old f-16s are barely operational . 
  honestly , f-16s should be more-than-capable of : 1 . 
  fly above madpads range . 
  drop bombs . 
  that 's really all that 's necessary in this conflict . 
   we do not have roaming tribes carving out a piece of our countries  neither did the roman empire , at the beginning .
