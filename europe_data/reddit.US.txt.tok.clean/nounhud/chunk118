  it was n't the only factor , but i do n't think that anyone would say that it was n't a factor . 
  it 's like the common `` a minute of silence '' . 
  it makes the point . 
   think we 'd be there without article 5 . 
  while i agree , i 'd go further . 
  you 'd be there even without the attacks on paris , for that matter -- you 've been bombing isil with a bunch of the rest of us [ for over a year now ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_shader ) . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generation-gap-could-see-the-old-vote-britain-out-of-eu-9322982.html  only 18 per cent of under-35s support withdrawal , compared to 56 per cent of those over 65 . 
  some 69 per cent of over-65s believe quitting the eu would leave them better off financially or unaffected , a view shared by 38 per cent of under-35s . 
   that can easily get past all hydro-acoustic monitoring stations and other traps , suffers from a couple of problems . 
  * seems like it relies on russia being able to make an undetectable submarine . 
  if russia can do that , no reason to bother making it a torpedo -- it 'd be preferable to let it do traditional launches . 
  * this is limited to coastal targets . 
  * the us and new zealand [ already went over this sort of weapon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsunami_bomb ) and did n't get too-excited :  a 1968 research report sponsored by the us office of naval research addressed this hypothesis of coastal damage due to large explosion-generated waves , and found theoretical and experimental evidence showing it to be relatively inefficient in wave-making potential , with most wave energy dissipated by breaking on the continental shelf before reaching the shore . 
  [ 4 ] * this concentrates a lot of energy at one place -- right at the shore -- and does n't spread inland effectively . 
  the thrust of at least a substantial amount of nuclear weapon development has been to avoid wasting the immense amount of energy available by throwing a lot of it in one place ( far more than is needed to be lethal ) and then having it be sub-lethal elsewhere that it * could * be lethal . 
  that 's why nuclear weapons [ airburst at precise heights to maximize the area that a strong force affects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_burst#nuclear_weapons ) , and a major reason for [ smaller mirvs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle ) rather than one giant warhead . 
  i would n't support that . 
  if it were a fight for survival and the only option at hand was `` the west or the middle east '' , that would make sense . 
  but it 's not . 
  right now , it 's a comparatively-small collection of people trying to overthrow governments in the region ; the cia 's estimates would put it [ between 50-80k people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant ) . 
  they 've been [ doing less than well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american-led_intervention_in_iraq_%282014%e2%80%93present%29 ) :  by april 2015 , isil had lost 25 -- 30 % of the maximum territory they had gained in iraq in december 2014 , to iraqi and american-led coalition forces , leaving them in possession of around 15,000 square miles of iraq . 
  [ 107 ] ... which is why hitting at civilians in the west is about the best that they 're going to manage , since they ca n't hit back at the military that 's bombing them . 
  those people would prefer an islam-versus-non-islam war , because it 'd grant them more manpower -- right now , it 's a tiny fraction of the people in the middle east supporting them . 
  in guerilla warfare , you want to establish a situation where actions that the other side takes against you * tends * to strengthen you by building more support for you , then you lose . 
  genocide in the middle east would tend to build support from other people outside the area : it would be disadvantageous to the west . 
  the current approach against isil have been targeted airstrikes -- whatever else the merits and drawbacks , it will tend to hit relatively-small numbers of people , just those targeted . 
  i 'd say that that makes sense for the moment ; as long as the militaries involved are n't asking for people on the ground , i certainly would n't try to override them . 
  this current business might warrant giving the militaries involved more resources , but i do n't inherently think that boots-on-the-ground is advantageous : fighting from where you ca n't be hit is a pretty strong position . 
  yes , absolutely -- just saying that if article 5 were invoked ( what / u/n3when is talking about ) , it would bring in nato . 
  2/10 people are n't actually attacking , though . 
  2/10 muslims are * saying * that they want to attack . 
  if 2/10 muslims were actually attacking the french people as a whole , there would indeed probably be holocaust-style executions of muslims . 
  but there is n't ; the numbers are nothing like that . 
   france will put boots on the ground after this , book it why ? 
  france can already kill whoever it wants to kill from the air . 
  the problem is n't killing people , but determining who should be killed . 
  if france puts soldiers on the ground , they can be shot . 
  that just improves isil 's position . 
  i 'm sure that the french military could do with more resources . 
  maybe things like having air-dropped microphones to monitor places would be helpful . 
  but i 'd let france 's military make the call about what the best move is here . 
  disagree . 
  the reason these attacks are happening is because the militaries involved against isil are in aircraft , out of range of rifles and explosives and so forth . 
  they are n't vulnerable to being hit , so isil had to fall back to the only targets they could hit -- civilians overseas . 
  if you put those solders on the ground , they become vulnerable again , and improve isil 's position . 
  military leaders went with an air war because they thought it would be the most-effective route . 
  i 'm not inclined to second-guess them . 
  the larger problem is identifying who is a party to kill and who is n't -- we * can * blow up any one person , but it 's hard to know who should be blown up . 
  just dropping a lot of soldiers in does n't do that . 
  [ wikipedia : american-led intervention in iraq ( 2014-present ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american-led_intervention_in_iraq_%282014%e2%80%93present%29 ) :  by april 2015 , isil had lost 25 -- 30 % of the maximum territory they had gained in iraq in december 2014 , to iraqi and american-led coalition forces , leaving them in possession of around 15,000 square miles of iraq . 
  [ 107 ] they ca n't hit the military there -- fighter-bombers and drones are n't something that they have weapons against . 
  as a result , trying to hit civilians back in europe/us/etc is their only option . 
  their attempt at establishing a caliphate has n't been too healthy . 
  once a new regime is in place and rule of law is restored , the issue is one of rounding up the responsible parties via police action rather than military conflict . 
  saudi arabia 's leadership is strongly-opposed to isis , as that regime is the thing that isis would like to overthrow . 
  saudi arabia has been bombing isis for a year now . 
  you know how you guys in europe are talking about border fences ? 
  http://www.ijreview.com/2015/01/233628-saudi-arabia-anti-isis-wall/  the oldest way to defend land is through a physical barrier , such as a wall . 
  yet some americans dispute the efficacy of a wall when defending our southern border against infiltration from either illegal immigrants or terrorists . 
    one country is not buying into that notion : saudi arabia . 
    last week , a saudi general was killed in a skirmish with isis at the border with iraq , along which saudi arabia is constructing a 600-mile-long wall ... 
  you guys have had some major islamic terrorist attacks in recent memory too . 
  you will never , probably even in a totalitarian state , ensure that it is impossible for anyone to perform an attack . 
  saudi arabia has been bombing isil for a while . 
  the saudi regime faces a rather larger threat from them than does france or the us or the uk . 
  whether that 's the case or not , if france is attacked on her soil , she 's the right to request aid . 
  to be fair , the major military powers in nato are already bombing isis . 
  `` meanwhile , [ liberland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberland ) has announced that it is granting citizenship to all migrants who apply , stating that it is interested in building up its workforce . '', 
  `` liberland has announced that it will begin accepting refugee applications directly from its embassy in the kingdom of north sudan , [ the only nation with which it has diplomatic relations ] ( https://www.kingdomsudan.org/uploads/media/liberland%20-%20proclamation.pdf ) '' . 
    there is no status quo in this referendum due to the eu being a process towards a federal europe . 
    same was said about the scottish referendum . 
  hmm . 
  how could it be said ? 
  scotland has been in the uk for over three hundred years and it 's not as if there was going to be some major change in scotland 's role if scotland did n't leave . 
  older voters are more-likely to show up to vote and more-likely to want to leave . 
   contrary to the us , ` defending yourself and your family ' is not a ( permitted ) purpose of owning guns and firearms in general in most european countries . 
  fwiw , while that 's certainly permitted and probably why most people purchase firearms , it 's not what the second amendment is there to protect from a designing-the-structure-of-the-constitution standpoint . 
  rather , it 's a final barrier for one 's own government using an army against the public . 
  the roman empire wound up with the army operating pretty much independently of the will of the public and simply appointing leaders , who then bought them off by throwing the ever-decreasing wealth of the empire at them . 
  as president madison , the author of the us constitution and bill of rights , wrote in [ federalist paper no . 
  46 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federalist_no._46 ) :  let a regular army , fully equal to the resources of the country , be formed ; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government ; still it would not be going too far to say , that the state governments , with the people on their side , would be able to repel the danger . 
  the highest number to which , according to the best computation , a standing army can be carried in any country , does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls ; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms . 
  this proportion would not yield , in the united states , an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men . 
  to these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands , officered by men chosen from among themselves , fighting for their common liberties , and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence . 
  it may well be doubted , whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops . 
  those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the british arms , will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it . 
  besides the advantage of being armed , which the americans possess over the people of almost every other nation , the existence of subordinate governments , to which the people are attached , and by which the militia officers are appointed , forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition , more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of . 
  notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of europe , which are carried as far as the public resources will bear , the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms . 
  and it is not certain , that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes . 
  but were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves , who could collect the national will and direct the national force , and of officers appointed out of the militia , by these governments , and attached both to them and to the militia , it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance , that the throne of every tyranny in europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it . 
  not if they were literally-quoting someone . 
  the homeland of the tuatha d\u00e9 danann ? 
   phrase : i hear what you say . 
    british meaning : i disagree and do not want to discuss it further . 
  not something i 'd see in the us . 
  the greatest extent i think i 'd see that phrase would be `` i hear what you say , but i still think that ... '' the similar-sounding `` i hear you '' would mean agreement , the opposite of the british meaning . 
   phrase : with the greatest respect ...   british meaning : i think you are an idiot . 
  not a us term , but there 's the similar `` with all due respect '' , which pretty much means `` with no respect whatsoever '' . 
   phrase : that 's not bad . 
    british meaning : that 's good .
