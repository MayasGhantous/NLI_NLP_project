  same . 
   phrase : that is a very brave proposal   british meaning : you are insane . 
  nope . 
  this is british-only . 
   phrase : quite good . 
    british meaning : a bit disappointing . 
  this would be a positive phrase in the us . 
   phrase : i would suggest ...   british meaning : do it or be prepared to justify yourself . 
  yeah , kinda similar -- the meaning of the phrase is stronger than the denotation would suggest . 
   phrase : oh , incidentally/by the way ...   british meaning : the primary purpose of our discussion is ... 
  i do n't know . 
  i guess that sometimes it does refer to relevant things as opposed to incidentals , but it definitely would n't normally be used to mean `` the primary purpose of our discussion is '' . 
   phrase : i was a bit disappointed that ...   british meaning : i am annoyed that . 
  similar . 
  this is an intentional understatement : `` a bit disappointed '' is actually pretty strong . 
   phrase : very interesting   british meaning : that is clearly nonsense not the same meaning . 
  maybe you could give it the same meaning by rolling your eyes or something , but the text alone would n't convey this . 
   phrase : i 'll bear it in mind . 
    british meaning : i 've forgotten it already . 
  i do n't really think so . 
  maybe `` i 'll be * sure * to bear that in mind '' , which would be sarcastic . 
   phrase : i 'm sure it 's my fault . 
    british meaning : it 's your fault . 
  not really , but a close equivalent would be `` maybe it 's just me , but ... ''  phrase : you must come for dinner . 
    british meaning : it 's not an invitation , i 'm just being polite . 
  i do n't think i hear people using this . 
  * maybe * `` we should get together sometime '' might just be polite . 
   phrase : i almost agree   british meaning : i do n't agree at all . 
  not in the us . 
   phrase : i only have a few minor comments . 
    british meaning : please rewrite completely . 
  no , the us would use the literal meaning . 
   phrase : could we consider some other options ? 
    british meaning : i do n't like your idea . 
  same . 
  i 'm not really following the article 's point . 
  it seems to be intermingling intergenerational wealth transfer ( i.e. 
  leaving an estate to someone ) and transferring the * business * that someone owns or runs . 
  i 'd also think that a larger influence than ability to leave the business to someone would be on mitigating risk -- put all your assets in one business in one country with some challenges coming up , and you 're open to losing it all . 
  germany is n't handing out guaranteed permanent residencies , though , and germany 's population is larger . 
  actually , this might be a pretty good time , if you 're willing to gamble on the war ending soon . 
  lots of people selling out . 
  you would n't want to buy a house when prices are sky-high and have nowhere to go but down . 
  buying a house now , you 're not-too-likely to lose much on it , and if syria recovers , you could make a fair chunk of change . 
   nah , that 's just different cultures or differences in the scale of the number of people that the countries are accepting . 
  my understanding is that the purpose of the hungarian fence was to direct illegal immigration to checkpoints where it could be controlled as well . 
  granted , policy * at * those checkpoints might differ , but that 's a different matter . 
  at what point was the eu seriously trying to control the outer borders , though ? 
  i mean , doing so to the degree that eu members would their own borders . 
   the west should be fighting isis like russia is doing , considering that we are more than capable of dropping bombs on them ourselves . 
  we have been . 
  in fact , russia has been the country that has n't been involved in the past .

  since then , nine countries , allied with the us in some coalition , have also executed airstrikes on isil in iraq , more or less in concert with ground warfare of kurdish and/or iraqi government forces against isil . 
  there have also been sporadic clashes between isil fighters , and us and canadian troops , several thousand of whom are acting in advisory and combat roles with iraqi and kurdish forces . 
  [ 105 ] [ 106 ] by april 2015 , isil had lost 25 -- 30 % of the maximum territory they had gained in iraq in december 2014 , to iraqi and american-led coalition forces , leaving them in possession of around 15,000 square miles of iraq .

'' [ 29 ] parliament was recalled on 26 september to debate the authorization of british airstrikes against isil in iraq . 
  david cameron told mps that intervention , at the request of the iraqi government , to combat a `` brutal terrorist organisation '' , was `` morally justified '' . 
  he went on to state that isil was a direct threat to the united kingdom and that british inaction would lead to `` more killing '' in iraq . 
  following a seven-hour debate , parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of airstrikes , with 524 votes in favour and 43 against . 
  [ 30 ] ... the royal air force began conducting armed sorties over iraq immediately after the vote , using six tornado gr4s stationed at raf akrotiri in cyprus . 
  [ 31 ] the first airstrike occurred on 30 september when a patrol of two tornado gr4s attacked an isil heavy weapons position using a paveway iv laser-guided bomb and an armed pickup truck using a brimstone missile . 
  on 3 october 2014 , the six tornado gr4s were bolstered by an additional two aircraft , bringing the total number of combat aircraft deployed on operation shader to eight .

  bush ( cvn-77 ) while she launched aircraft into iraq and syria . 
  [ 33 ]   on 16 october 2014 , the ministry of defence announced the deployment of an undisclosed number of mq-9 reaper unmanned combat aerial vehicles to assist with surveillance . 
  [ 34 ] however , michael fallon stated that the reapers could also conduct airstrikes alongside the tornado gr4s . 
  [ 34 ] the first airstrike conducted by a reaper occurred on 10 november 2014 . 
  [ 35 ] by 26 september 2015 -- a full year after the operation first began -- tornado and reaper aircraft had flown over 1,300 missions against isil and had conducted more than 300 airstrikes , killing more than 330 isil fighters .

  it conducted the airstrikes on an isis depot in mosul , dropping 4 gbu-12 bombs . 
  [ 21 ] hollande 's office said that the isis depot that was targeted was hit and completely destroyed . 
  [ 22 ] the airstrikes resulted in killing 75 fighters from the islamic state .

  russia has been [ burning through its foreign exchange reserves ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/27/russias-reserve-fund-could-run-empty-in-2016.html ) :  russian finance minister anton siluanov prompted more concerns over the health of the russian economy tuesday when he said there was a danger that the country 's vast reserve fund could be entirely exhausted in 2016 if oil prices stay at their current level . 
  i listed the quarterly decreases for the first three quarters . 
  even if russia 's gdp went to zero in the fourth quarter , which it obviously is n't going to do , it would n't be sufficient to get the total 2015 gdp low enough to meet that number . 
  also , you were using an estimate for 2015 as a starting point , rather than as an ending point -- that is , saying that russia was starting 2015 just above $ 1t and then falling below over the course of the year . 
  that would have double-counted the decreases for 2015 . 
  that was an estimate of what it might be for 2015 done at the beginning of the year . 
  if you look at [ the imf page that was the source ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=83&amp;pr.y=16&amp;sy=2015&amp;ey=2015&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=193%2c273%2c223%2c156%2c924%2c922%2c132%2c184%2c134%2c534%2c536%2c136%2c158%2c112%2c111%2c542&amp;s=ngdpd%2cpppgdp&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ) , it reads `` shaded cells indicate imf staff estimates '' , and it 's for 2015 . 
  based on the actual numbers that have come out over the course of the year , that was a well-too-pessimistic estimate . 
  surely differences would be bidirectional ? 
   north america has shit bread just to be clear , wonderbread ( white , well-processed , inexpensive , can last for many days due to preservatives ) is n't the only type of bread in the us . 
  that being said , i do agree that breads have not been a us culinary strong point -- there are very few breads that have been developed in the us . 
  i went looking a while back and came up with : * [ san francisco sourdough ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sourdough#type_i_sourdough ) * [ anadama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anadama_bread ) * [ boston brown bread ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brown_bread#boston_brown_bread ) * [ cornbread ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornbread ) .
