  we 're talking about in comparison to , say , russia , where the ussr and the us were holding guns aimed at each other 's head daring the other to twitch for half of the last century . 
  have there been disagreements ? 
  sure . 
  and i 'm sure that there will be disagreements in the future . 
  but of those potential powers , would you say that any of the others are friendlier or more-likely to be friendly ? 
  given that the us has to accept a relatively-smaller degree of influence in the world , if you 're the us , which would you most - and least - want to gain influence ? 
  china and the us do business , and it 's not the cold war between the two any longer . 
  but our militaries were fighting not that long ago , and us military aircraft and warships are involved in establishing access even today . 
  that 's not the most-comfortable of relationships . 
  it 's awfully different from how the us and the eu deal with each other . 
   back the in the 20s and early 30s many world leaders thought the next major global conflict would be between the two . 
  you 're referring to [ war plan red ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_plan_red ) ? 
  the us probably has pre-prepared war plans for conflict with every militarily-significant country on earth , and [ at that time had plans for the other major world factions as well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_color-coded_war_plans ) . 
  better than trying to produce them at a moment 's notice , without the luxury of time . 
  maybe so , but that segment ( or anyone already committed to a side ) is n't the undecided swing voters that actually matter here . 
   i think the extreme influence of just the us alone is enough , then throw in china . . not going to happen . 
  it 's a public referendum , not some bureaucrats cutting a deal . 
  how much does fred bloggs care about what chinese leadership says ? 
  i 'm no foreign policy wonk , but : * brexit will impact the eu directly , via removing a large , well-to-do , militarily-powerful country with a well-functioning economy . 
  it will create a potential rival or competitor well down the road . 
  it will establish a route out of the eu . 
  brexit is n't good news for an influential eu down the road . 
  * the us 's relative influence in the world will decline , unless the continued development of the poorer parts of the world stops . 
  in the future , barring a change in present trends , the us is going to have to work with more countries than in the past . 
  which countries has the us worked with most-effectively in the past , and which has the us tended to be in conflict with ? 
  [ here 's the list of potential superpowers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potential_superpowers ) . 
  china ? 
  india ? 
  or the countries in the eu ? 
  what would the us prefer to have relatively-influential in the future ? 
  if the eu splinters , the most-us-friendly and most-similar-to-the-us of the potential future superpowers will see a decline in influence . 
  * i vaguely-expect that a uk not in the eu will seek to play the us and the eu off against each other in the way that non-aligned countries tried to play the ussr and the us off against each other . 
  not great for future us-eu relations . 
  that was kind of an emergency situation where france was facing an existential threat . 
  no , assuming the political will to meet the needs of the hungry and assuming that the russian agriculture sector continues to function -- russia is a net grain exporter . 
  russia has some issues , but she is n't north korea by a long shot . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/developing_country  a developing country , also called a less developed country or underdeveloped country , is a nation with a less developed industrial base , and a low human development index ( hdi ) relative to other countries . 
  `` developing country '' is a confusing euphemism that 's held reasonably-well recently because the poorer places in the world have been undergoing industrialization . 
  does n't actually refer to the direction that they 're going . 
   a fully developed economy is noy about self sufficiency . 
  in fact , a well-developed economy may very easily be * less * self-sufficient than an undeveloped one . 
  if the outside world vanishes , farmer joe in some back-country farm is probably going to be less-catastrophically-impacted than someone in the midst of a teeming metropolis . 
  quite the east-west divide . 
  edit : goddammit , they used radius instead of area . 
  https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/r40095.pdf  between 1995 and 2008 , the united states provided north korea with over $ 1.3 billion in assistance : slightly more than 50 % for food aid and about 40 % for energy assistance . 
  since early 2009 , the united states has provided virtually no aid to north korea , though episodically there have been discussions about resuming large-scale food aid . 
  additionally , the obama administration officials have said that they woul d be willing to consider other types of aid if north korea takes steps indicating that it will dismantle its nuclear program , a prospect that most analysts view as increasingly remote . 
  as of march 2014 , barring an unexpected breakthrough , there appears little likelihood the obama administration will provide large-scale assistance of any type to north korea in the near future . 
  members of congress have a number of tools they could use to influence the development and implementation of aid programs with north korea . 
  food aid . 
    large swathes of north korea 's population have suffered from chronic malnutrition since the mid-1990s . 
  food aid -- largely from china , south korea , and the united states -- has been essential in filling the gap between north korea 's supply and demand , though since 2009 donations from all countries except china have dwindled to a minimal amount . 
  fast-forward a few years . 
  [ 2016 : chinese military official scolds north korea for ` ungrateful behavior ' ] ( http://www.upi.com/top_news/world-news/2016/02/29/chinese-military-official-scolds-north-korea-for-ungrateful-behavior/7121456766767/ )  hong kong , feb. 29 ( upi ) -- an influential chinese air force general and writer slammed north korea for taking chinese food aid while not expressing `` gratitude . '', 
    maj. gen. qiao liang , a frequent military commentator , said pyongyang must start by changing its `` ungrateful behavior , '' hong kong-based magazine zijing reported monday . 
    the statement comes days after the united states and china agreed to enforce a tougher resolution at the united nations security council . 
  the resolution includes economic sanctions targeting the north 's weapons program and could pass this week . 
    qiao said north korea is making china `` uncomfortable , '' adding that while pyongyang is free to choose its own political system , china `` absolutely will not tolerate this attitude of north korea . '', 
    `` for the last half-century all china did to influence north korea was to provide unconditional aid , with no strings attached , '' qiao said . 
  `` north korea used to concern itself with china 's reactions but now they do n't accept our demands , and our influences seem to be diminishing . '', 
    qiao , who often speaks on behalf of beijing , said the key to the north korea nuclear issue lies in u.s. hands , and that china 's hands are tied . 
  the best beijing can do is promote dialogue among the countries concerned , he said . 
    the chinese general also voiced concerns regarding the deployment of u.s. anti-missile defense system thaad in south korea , saying , `` if the north korea nuclear problem persists , south korea can only accept u.s. demands to deploy thaad . '', 
    beijing has repeatedly warned south korea against the deployment of terminal high altitude area defense near its borders . 
    in addition to taking action at the security council , beijing may be working independently toward stricter regulations against the north . 
    north korean ships have been banned from docking at ports in dandong , china 's border city , and pyongyang 's vessels are no longer allowed to dock and transfer goods to china , local sources said . 
  unless y' all rooskies want to step up and be kim 's sugar daddy -- because he 's running terribly short on sources -- i 'm going to bet that north korea will tone it down at some point not that far in the future . 
  let them stop eating cake and eat bread !, 
  fair enough . 
  note that imho pension funds are a big * fat * delicious target to loot . 
  lots of money stored up being administered by someone other than the people who depend on the thing for retirement . 
  i trust the us financial system more than i do russia 's ( and you can say that this is bias on my part , but ... ) and the us has seen plenty of this -- the financial crisis put things under stress and turned up all sorts of monkey business . 
  * [ the pension fund that ate california ] ( http://www.city-journal.org/html/pension-fund-ate-california-13528.html ) : `` activist investing '' from [ corrupt fund managers ] ( http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-villalobos-suicide-20150115-story.html ) , and other hanky-panky . 
  * [ wikipedia : general motors chapter 11 reorganization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_motors_chapter_11_reorganization ) in effect let gm unrealistically over-promise future compensation to workers to get work , then shed liabilities in bankruptcy . 
  the us post office ( which has been shrinking and was expected to shrink ) tried doing something similar recently when consultants were brought into improve their balance sheet via eliminating the mandate to pre-fund future employee benefits . 
  that keeps things running for now by taking out what is effectively unlikely-to-be-paid-off debt , but burns future pensioners ( or hopes to offload future defaults on taxpayers , though the uspto is only quasi-governmental ) . 
  * also see the state of [ us state pension plans ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/14/retirement/worst-state-pensions/ ) , which are heavily underfunded . 
  it 's very common for states to simply not pay as much as they 're obligated to pay -- looting the pension fund . 
  it 's also possible to solve labor disputes by simply making huge future promises rather than increasing taxes ... and then letting some future administration have to deal with the problem , which sometimes happens by simply defaulting on those pension promises , a la [ detroit ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-05/detroit-pension-cuts-from-bankruptcy-prompt-cries-of-betrayal ) or [ ongoing calpers legal battles ] ( http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-pension-controversy-20150317-story.html ) hitting the `` default on future promises '' stage of the game . 
  when you 've got a huge wad of cash available -- and that 's what a pension fund is -- there are many ways to siphon some money off the thing . 
  it 's a big , fat cow just waiting to be bled . 
  russia 's seen companies dig into the nwf for `` investment '' schemes , and the thing be used as a piggy bank to forestall the current financial conflict from taking effect . 
  it 's going to be interesting to see what the political impact of a pensions implosion in russia would be , given how important pensions in russia are . 
  if you take your compensation as a pension , you 're making a big bet that you 'll actually be paid compensation due you now down the road when you lack leverage -- the ability to withhold labor -- to do much about it if you get burned . 
  how many public-sector pension systems are currently operating sustainably even as regards population decrease alone today ? 
   ca n't happen . 
  pension ... contributions ( do n't know if correct translation ) are mandatory in russia . 
  ca n't happen ... if the pension fund stays solvent .

  it seems likely that there would n't be agreement there .

  it 's only going to get more annoying as time goes on .
