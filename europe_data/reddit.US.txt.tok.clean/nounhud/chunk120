  also , the [ low-carb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/low-carbohydrate_diet ) craze * followed * by the anti-gluten craze has pretty much screwed over a lot of the us baking industry . 
  to be fair , california is arguably not * completely * representative of the us in this matter . 
  yin and yang .

   from russia 's wikipedia page ... 1.175 trillion ( april 2015 ) i do n't see the text `` 1.175 '' anywhere on [ russia 's wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia ) . 
  could you link to the page in question ? 
  here 's [ wikipedia 's list of countries by gdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29 ) , including 2014 numbers from the imf and world bank , both of which list $ 1.86 t for 2014 . http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp-growth-annual  the russian economy shrank 4.1 percent year-on-year in the three months to september of 2015 , preliminary estimates from the federal statistics service showed ... in the second quarter , the gdp fell by 4.6 percent and by 2.2 percent in the first three months of the year . 
  that is n't nearly enough to account for that kind of fall . 
  that can not be right . 
  [ in 2014 , russia had a gdp of $ 1.86 t ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/gdp ) . 
  russia 's economy is taking it in the rear , but half of it did not vanish in the ten months since 2014 . 
  it [ looks like sweden and germany are larger finnish export destinations than either russia or the us ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/fin/ ) . 
  china just [ decided to end one child ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34665539 ) . 
  in some ways , it might be seen as compensation for mao 's policy of trying to dramatically * increase * population which had led to a population bulge . 
  i do agree with ending one child . 
  if china wants to limit or reduce population , it has gentler incentive knobs available than outright fining people . 
  when the luddites were doing this [ last time around ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/luddite ) , they actually went out and bought product from the same guy who was selling the automation to the business owners . 
   according to folklore , the movement was inadvertently started by an english `` simpleton '' , ned ludd [ wp ] who in 1779 destroyed some stocking frames , fearing the loss of his job . 
  his name subsequently became associated with the `` luddite riots '' of 1812 to 1818 . 
  [ 2 ]    ``'' the luddites swung hammers forged by a blacksmith named enoch taylor , who also made machinery for their adversaries , mill owners . 
  `` enoch made them , '' the luddites would say . 
  `` so enoch shall break them . 
  '' [ 3 ]   the luddite 's tool of choice became known as `` enoch 's hammer '' . 
  they saw the customers of automation as being the bad guys , not the people creating automation technology . 
  not saying that that also does n't happen , though i think that video footage of the leader of the country saying something * does * have an impact . 
  that being said , you do raise an interesting point -- if the main way that people saw merkel saying something was on smuggler videos , they could n't see any follow-up clarification . 
  i 'd assumed that it was via press , in which case it would be possible to issue a follow-up clarification . 
   essentially , people fear becoming social isolates and thus take measures to avoid such a consequence , as demonstrated by psychologist solomon asch in the asch conformity experiments . 
  that does mean that if anonymous speech or pseudonymous speech is available , that the phenomenon falls apart . 
  if you were in their shoes , would you want to go back to eritrea/syria/nigeria / etc or stay in europe ? 
   they are also frustrated because they do n't know what their future will be like . 
  ` we do n't know what is going on and nobody can answer our questions ' one of them tells omroep west . 
  realistically , i do n't think that anyone * can * say what will be happening a year from now , though i suppose if they do n't speak swedish , it might make it harder to figure out what 's going on . 
  i bet that if norway or switzerland applied , they 'd be okay with it . 
  when you 're all about fighting the man , being the man is awkward . 
  you 're winning then , because the us has n't added anything since the [ northern mariana islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_mariana_islands ) voted to become a us territory and congress agreed in 1976 . 
  i 've no real objection with having standards present across schools . 
  means that schools can rely on students knowing a common set of the most-critical knowledge , so that if they move they are n't behind in some areas and ahead in others . 
  the us gallon , not to be confused with the us dry gallon :  the us dry gallon   this gallon is one-eighth of a us winchester bushel of 2150.42 cubic inches ; it is therefore equal to exactly 268.8025 cubic inches or about 4.405 l . the us dry gallon is not used in commerce , and is not listed in the relevant statute , which jumps from the dry quart to the peck . 
  my understanding is that this had been steadily scaled down -- a few people were dead set on it , probably because various people were getting money from selling land or from construction contracts . 
  the current buildout , last i looked , connected bakersfield ( not remotely a useful place to be without an automobile ) to nowhere . 
  the sf bay does n't even really have the south bay particularly well connected to the west and easy bay and the * existing * rail had funding problems due to insufficient usage . 
  trying to connect a massive , expensive set of infrastructure attached to that seems crazy to me -- if someone wants to improve rail , i 'd be first building local mass transit until the existing system in a high-density area is viable , then move out . 
  and honestly , i think that california * would * probably have made that call , except that there was matching funds available to * instead * do the california hsr rollout . 
  my suspicion is that there 's going to be a segment of the thing built in the middle of nowhere , a few construction companies will get a ton of money , it wo n't get any ridership ( it simply ca n't -- there are few people out there , much less people in an area that taking mass transit to would be useful ) . 
  edit : actually , it [ looks like now bakersfield has been cut out ] ( http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-high-speed-route-20150608-story.html ), 
  hmm . 
  i 'm not an expert on islam , but i believe that that is incorrect , at least as long as the hooker is also muslim . 
  [ 1 ] it includes extramarital sex and premarital sex , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] such as adultery ( consensual sexual relations outside marriage ) , [ 4 ] fornication ( consensual sexual intercourse between two unmarried persons ) , [ 5 ] and homosexuality ( consensual sexual relations between same-sex partners ) . 
  [ 6 ] traditionally , a married or unmarried muslim male could have sex outside marriage with a non-muslim slave , with or without her consent , and such sex was not considered zina . 
  if it 's going to be haram , it might as well be worth it . 
  hey , be nice . 
  the saudis are beating up russia 's economy for you , as well as subsidizing europe 's economy . 
  well , except for norway , i guess . 
  i rarely see `` litre '' even in places like / r/europe , though . 
  i think that the french won on metric , but i 'm dubious about them winning on the spelling . 
  if california high-speed rail is viable anywhere , it 'll be between san diego and los angeles . 
  los angeles to san francisco is just too unpopulated and the ticket cost is almost the same as a flight -- it does n't play to rail strengths of stops along a route to load and unload at all , and the only us rail lines that break even are in the densely-populated northeastern us . 
  quotas do n't reduce illegal immigration . 
  they just avoid dumping all the load on one country or two . 
  in fact , quotas ( to the extent that they provide a reliable route out of greece ) probably increase illegal immigration . 
  here are some options : * the australian model : arrange for a safe-but-not-economically-advantageous third-party to hold people . 
  they can leave at any time , and they are n't going to be killed , but there 's no economic incentive to do this -- it 's just waiting out a war . 
  * violating and/or withdrawing from the 1951 refugee convention and not offering citizen-level welfare . 
  some welfare is probably necessary , since you do n't want people getting robbed . 
  * no granting any favorable status to people applying domestically ( even if they * managed * to avoid being registered by intermediate states ) . 
  you manage to sneak into germany and apply , you get no edge over someone applying from turkey -- germany plans to take n people and is n't going to take more and is blind to their location of application . 
  * set a minimum processing period with safe but relatively-undesirable conditions . 
  this is bending the refugee convention , but might be legally-easier than violating or withdrawing from it . 
  * explicitly-discontinuing the route to permanent residency and citizenship via asylum for the duration of the current crisis . 
  this is probably a * big * part of the draw , and yet it is something that is easily separable from granting asylum status . 
  ideally , the same policy would be adopted eu-wide so that the eu member with the least-restrictive policies is n't used as a crack to enter the eu . 
  any of these , if used , will reduce germany 's pull into europe , but wo n't result in people randomly being littered across europe if they get picked up in another country first . 
  finally , if you want quotas ( despite them creating pull ) , i 'm pretty sure that you can get them to work in at least some numbers , but if you do so , i 'd do it where a unanimous vote is required for each additional fixed increment , and there 's an agreement to not engage in reprisals at countries that veto . 
  i do n't think that eu members were so concerned about distributing 160k as they were about opening the floodgates to unbounded future masses . 
  if you * are n't * trying to use this as a back door to get unbounded quotas , no reason to leave that doubt present . 
  i do n't recall `` a thing '' being a thing in the 1990s , which [ seems to agree with this discussion ] ( http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/144171/phrasal-verb-be-a-thing ) . 
   college loans to get a degree which is n't worth as much as the money spent on it . 
  that will happen in europe too . 
  just gets billed to society as a whole instead of the individual . 
  i * do * see eu flair in here , though i 'm also gon na bet that / r/europe 's population is n't representative of europe as a whole . 
   american federal taxes would be like what gets paid straight to the eu . 
  the analogy , that it 's only part of the government , would make sense , but the federal government in the us is much relatively-larger than the eu bureaucracy . 
  since this is mostly about the us ... i 'm american , but i 've worked with some europeans in the us and the major negative surprises about the us that i recall them bringing up with me ( more memorable than the positive things ) : * the germans were very disappointed by us housing , which they felt was flimsy and cheap . 
  i understand that a solid cement or brick building is considered to be a necessity in germany , whereas wood and drywall flexed , and let sound through . 
  this had a very negative association in their heads . 
  * germans also thought that they could bicycle everywhere in the us rather than getting a car . 
  that illusion went away quickly . 
  * a visiting brit was appalled by restaurant portion sizes , which he thought was something more like two meals . 
  it was n't the fried content of the food or anything like that -- it was just the amount . 
  * i tended to get questions about tipping or nervous glances from europeans to see who i was giving money to . 
  i heard a bunch of complaints about how us tipping was confusing and people felt worried about being embarrassed for doing something wrong . 
  http://www.payscale.com/research/us/degree=bachelor%27s_degree,_computer_science_%28cs%29/salary#by_years_experience median salary in the us for less than a year of experience with a bachelor 's in computer science is $ 58,562 . 
  note that that 's salary , and not total compensation . 
  some of that is probably just different bookkeeping . 
  us : individual takes out private debt , gets college degree . 
  on the net , a degree has a positive return-on-investment ( * not * the case for all degrees -- if you get a theology degree , you wind up poorer than you would have been ) , which incentivizes him to pay the interest on any debt . 
  ( various government subsidies also show up , but private individuals play a big role . ), 
  debt shows up on the books .
