  europe ( well , most of europe , at any rate ) : state subsidizes most or all education , transferring money from the older generation in the population to the younger . 
  that generation then grows up and gets jobs , while the older generation retires . 
  the seniors expect the younger generation to pay for their medical care , pension , and similar and thus transfers a ton of wealth back . 
  that future obligation does not show up as national debt , though in practice it 's a large financial obligation . 
  mind , the us does have some government subsidies for education , and social security exists in the us too . 
  just saying that some of this is just whether debt is on-the-books and attached to an individual or whether it 's informal and attached to the government . 
  you do n't like that , you would n't believe how much [ natural gas has to be flared off to get at that delicious oil ] ( http://www.resilience.org/stories/2013-09-03/gas-flaring-the-burning-issue ) .

  [ depends on the city ] ( http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/gov-public-transportation-riders-demographic-divide-for-cities.html ) . 
  new york city is so dense that there is n't really a viable alternative to mass transit , so everyone uses it . 
  in more-typical american cities , mass transit is strongly-tilted towards those who ca n't scrape the money to have the privacy and convenience of a car . 
   riders in new york city -- home to the most public transportation users of any u.s. city -- reported median incomes of $ 35,350 , just below $ 36,803 for all commuters ... san diego residents taking public transportation to work earn less than half as much as other city workers . 
  that being said , most of the unpleasant stories i hear from people criticizing san francisco 's mass transit system are about specifically-homeless-and-crazy people or drunk/drugged-up people . 
  ah , you 're right , you 're right . 
  i 'm not an order of magnitude off . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're computing . 
  let 's look at my post . 
   the inflation-adjusted spending on nasa from 1966 is $ 319b . 
  in 1966 dollars , nasa 's budget in 1966 [ was $ 43,554 m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_nasa ) . 
  [ inflation-adjusting this ] ( http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=43554&amp;year1=1966&amp;year2=2015 ) from 1966 dollars to 2015 dollars yields $ 319b . 
   that 's over half of the entire us military budget for 2015 https://www.nationalpriorities.org/campaigns/military-spending-united-states/ the us military budget for 2015 in 2015 dollars is $ 598.5 b. 
   and the us is no slouch on military spending . 
  the us is the largest military spender in absolute terms in the world , and over half of the discretionary federal budget ( which admittedly omits immense budget items like medicare and medicaid ) goes to military spending . 
   in european terms , over the entire 2014 gdp of finland , or about seven lithuanias . 
  [ finland 's 2014 gdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29 ) was $ 272b ( in 2014 dollars , which is close-enough ) , and lithuania 's 2014 gdp was $ 45.932 b ; 1/6 .95 th the inflation-adjusted nasa spending in question . 
   the us used to put a really extraordinary amount of money into nasa , so you could be calibrated to those times . 
  not sure what you could dispute here . 
  no , i compared the one year in which nasa peaked , explicitly-said that it was one year , and inflation-adjusted it to compare to a correct other component of annual spending . 
  or it 's just remembering that the last time that north africa and the middle east had clout in europe , it was via islam . 
  since then , the whole mass has become fragmented and ineffectual . 
  [ christendom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christendom ) was a `` tribe '' to affiliate with above the local tribal level that helped unify europe from its fragmented era of infighting to become a geopolitical power :  in its historical sense , the term usually refers to the medieval and early modern period , during which the christian world represented a geopolitical power juxtaposed with both paganism and especially the military threat of the muslim world . 
  and  the catholic church 's peak of authority over all european christians and their common endeavours of the christian community -- for example , the crusades , the fight against the moors in the iberian peninsula and against the ottomans in the balkans -- helped to develop a sense of communal identity against the obstacle of europe 's deep political divisions . 
  there are some parallels to that time . 
  a leading contender for the throne for `` mechanism to unify and make more powerful '' would be [ secular pan-arabism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan-arabism ) , but since that did n't do so well under nasser , mena went looking for something better . 
  that being said , i do think that using religion to unify peoples was more-important to geopolitical power in the past than to today , when masses of people with weapons represented the pinnacle of military power ; today , technological disparity ( and an industrially-powerful society to back that ) is pretty important , as you can see countries easily rolling over forces in mena from the air . 
  as [ han solo put it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v268qk6-xsw ) :  hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side . 
   no , the us defense budget for 2015 is $ 1.1 trillion . 
  examine your chart . 
  that $ 1.1 t is the entire us discretionary spending amount , not the military budget . 
  i certainly think that it will decrease pull factors . 
  i 'm just saying that `` close the borders alone '' is n't a complete solution -- you have to make a hard decision about what to do with the people that hit that border at sea . 
   germany , knowing that greece would be unable to handle the refugees if sent back , decided that -- as the law says '' if they want to '' -- they would just accept the refugees and not send them back . 
    now germany wants to send them back again . 
  from the article :  `` germany is currently applying the dublin regulation for all countries of origin and all member states ** ( except greece ) ** '' the ministry said in an emailed statement , adding that dublin rules has also applied to `` syrian nationals '' since october 21 . 
   thus the only viable long-term solution is to close the borders . 
  let 's say that it 's practical to intercept people in the mediterranean . 
  you still have the question of where to put them . 
  germany , do n't get me wrong , i think that a reduction-of-illegal-immigration solution is probably in the eu 's interest , but could you possibly adopt one that does n't set eu member state against eu member state ? 
  the inflation-adjusted spending on nasa from 1966 is $ 319b . 
  that 's over half of the entire us military budget for 2015 ... and the us is no slouch on military spending . 
  in european terms , over the entire 2014 gdp of finland , or about seven lithuanias . 
  the us used to put a really extraordinary amount of money into nasa , so you could be calibrated to those times . 
  they * sound * inoffensive , but would you rather be killed via bullet or broomstick ? 
  the bullet is a mercy . 
  syria : * if i understand wikipedia correctly , it 's currently [ classifying this war as now up to a six-sided war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_civil_war ) ( though it 's treating turkey , the us , and saudi arabia as being in one faction , though the various countries seem to have their own interests in knocking various people off and their alliances do n't all overlap perfectly ) . 
  * four nuclear powers involved -- france , the uk , the us , and russia . 
  * [ four of the top five world 's oil producers -- the us , saudi arabia , russia , and canada -- fighting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_oil_production ) . 
  * ireland and new zealand the only anglosphere members not involved . 
  * a conflict involving all three of the abrahamic faiths , with at least some factions openly declaring religious war . 
  and that 's not counting the sunni-shiite split between iran and some of the other middle eastern countries . 
  * many countries now with fighter jets involved . 
  * naval forces from major world naval powers involved : france , russia , the uk , and the us . 
  * the largest migrant crisis in europe since world war ii . 
  * for background , a land war with russia ongoing in ukraine . 
  not boring , that 's for sure . 
  linked-to in the article : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/18/swedish-private-housing-sector-refugees  about 44 % of respondents in an ipsos poll in september said sweden should take more refugees -- an increase of 18 percentage points since february -- while 30 % were opposed . 
  almost a third of swedes said they were willing to house a refugee in their home . 
  sounds like there 's still a lot more room , then . 
  sweden 's got an [ average household size of 2 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/household_composition_statistics ) and a [ population of ~ 10m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden ) . 
  say 5m households , that 's room for another 1.67 m refugees . 
  ... though if you assume family reunification will need to eat into that , that might be getting pretty close to the limit already depending upon how many people each already-arrived refugee will pull in . 
   migrationsverket expects the total number of refugees to reach about 170,000 by the end of the year , with 10,000 people arriving every week , compared with 4,000 during the summer . 
  i was certainly wrong when i thought that the numbers would slow in the winter . 
  hmm . 
  you mean to intercept missiles targeting the us from europe ? 
  i do n't think that that 's correct -- this is to provide coverage of europe . 
  there are three points where an ballistic missile can be intercepted . 
  checking wikipedia for the list of current us systems : first , during the boost phase , where the ballistic missile is rising . 
  this is what you 'd be talking about , where you need to be nearby . 
  afaik the us has no present-day system capable of hitting russian ballistic missiles in the boost phase . 
  second , during the midcourse phase , outside of the atmosphere . 
  this is implemented by [ gmd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ground-based_midcourse_defense ) or [ abmd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aegis_ballistic_missile_defense_system ) and is the currently-best us abm capability . 
  third , during the terminal phase , where the warheads are descending . 
  this is currently implemented by [ thaad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terminal_high_altitude_area_defense ) and the soon-to-be-defunct [ meads ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meads ) . 
  that being said , i * do * imagine that it would be preferable to have the shield in place than not , in such a scenario . 
   who is making tensions ? 
  well ... in russia 's defense , from a strategic standpoint , my understanding is that an abm shield , at least as presently-deployed , is not necessarily defensive . 
  against north korea , say , yes , a shield could be defensive . 
  there 's a small nk arsenal , a large economic disparity , and a missile shield could fully-counter the arsenal . 
  against russia , however , things are a bit different . 
  [ going from this page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#nuclear_arsenal_of_russia ) , as of 2009 , russia had 1,248 warheads on icbms and 591 warheads on slbms . 
  ( while some of these are mirving , i believe that current us abm systems intercept on descent , so what matters is the warhead count , not the ballistic missile count ) . 
  the us currently does n't have anything like the capability to stop all of russia 's arsenal if russia were to do an all-out launch of its arsenal . 
  what it * does * have is enough to potentially stop the few remaining russian ballistic missiles that would survive a us preemptive attack . 
  from russia 's standpoint , then , the present abm shield represents a tool to enable offense rather than one providing defense ( even aside from the fact that it obviously is a step towards eliminating russia 's ability to engage in mad in general ) . 
  obviously , it also has applications of concern to russia other than enabling a us preemptive strike , like interfering with limited use of ballistic missiles or maybe in the long term neutralizing russia 's entire arsenal via wider deployment , if that 's cost-effective . 
  i 'm just saying that the idea of a missile shield as an offensive weapon is n't outright absurd , though the names ( `` shield '' and `` missile '' ) suggest that . 
  good catch . 
  the mods need to tag this post for having an inaccurate headline ( the post submission accurately-reflected the original title , but the article title was misleading ) .
