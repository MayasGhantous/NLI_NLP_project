  since this is the uk , [ sovereign immunity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_immunity#united_kingdom ) might also apply in a particularly literal sense . 
  according to wikipedia , sovereign immunity for the crown was * generally * ended in the uk in 1947 , but i 'm not sure whether that was retroactive or not , and this suit would be referring to actions taken when sovereign immunity did apply . 
  if the crown proceedings act 1947 is n't retroactive , i 'd think that sovereign immunity might be another barrier .

  fox news is n't state-run or funded . 
  it sells to political views because a lot of people enjoy watching political mud-slinging against the other tribe . 
  ditto for the other strong left - or right - media sources in the us . 
  npr gets ( some ) state funding , but they 're a very moderate center-left , and while there might be some bias by the fact that they 're state-funded , i think that few would argue that they 're directed in any way to push particular political views . 
  if you wanted to see us state-run stuff pushed out to the international community , you 'd need to look at voa or rfe/rl .

  first , the law firm stated that it was filing suit under a general law , and second , [ the holocaust act 2009 appears to only cover a couple of museums ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/16/data.pdf ) . 
  i am not a british lawyer , but i do n't see how this would work . 
   the group have instructed lawyers to attempt to begin proceedings in england 's high court , british newspapers said ... satish jakhu , of the rubric lois king law firm , was quoted as saying they would claim under the common law doctrine of `` trespass to goods '' ... the 105-carat diamond is set in the crown made for the queen elizabeth , the wife of queen elizabeth ii 's father king george vi , for their 1937 coronation . 
  [ wikipedia : trespass in english law : trespass to goods ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trespass_in_english_law#trespass_to_goods ) :  trespass to goods is defined as `` wrongful physical interference with goods that are in the possession of another '' . 
  it is covered not only by the common law , but also by the torts ( interference with goods ) act 1977 , which was written to clear up the confusing rules on trespass to goods which had evolved over the centuries . 
  [ 5 ] it is similar to the tort of conversion , which covers the interference with goods in a way which is inconsistent with the rights of the owner . 
  [ 43 ] `` physical interference '' is usually the taking or destroying of goods , but can be as minor as touching or moving them in the right circumstances . 
  [ wikipedia : limitation periods in the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limitation_periods_in_the_uk ) :  in the united kingdom there are limitation periods ( time limits ) after which court actions can not be taken in certain types of cases . 
  the laws which enact these time limits are known as the statutes of limitations . 
  [ wikipedia : limitation act 1980 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limitation_act_1980 ) :  torts : general rule : limited to 6 years   conversion of goods : limited to 6 years from first conversion . 
  i am assuming here that the limitation on tresspass to goods is equal to that on conversion of goods or that the general tort rule applies . 
  you 'd probably need a british lawyer to know for sure . 
  but broadly-speaking , law does n't let you dig up ancient claims and then have them enforced . 
  it 's super-disruptive and hard to obtain evidence after a certain period of time . 
  i imagine that the law firm has * some * sort of plan of attack , else they would n't announce it , but i do n't see how they could expect to win . 
  maybe they hope for some sort of settlement to avoid embarrassment or something ...

  the 2 % in particular is not a magic line , but the * idea * of establishing a minimum is important , to every other member trying to get other members to pay for the defense . 
  defense is a [ public good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_good ) and certainly having policy in place to address the [ free rider ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_rider_problem ) problem with public goods is n't normally considered unreasonable . 
   the only country that bothers me a little with its lack of military readiness is germany , but germany is n't threatened by a russian border germany gets threatened for the same reason that the uk and the us were threatened by the idea of a collapse in europe in the past -- if every individual state only acts to defend itself , no one state is strong enough alone , and the whole becomes subject to divide-and-conquer . 
  it could be via nato , could be via the eu , or could be via some other mechanism , but i * do * think that the idea of a defense agreement is in member state interests . 
   countries are either just fine not spending that much , like france which seems to get a lot of bang for its buck in terms of money spent for capability available . 
  is france fine with that , or is france fine with that only as long as other countries provide defense ? 
  let 's say that tomorrow , all other nato and eu members set their military spending to zero . 
  would france still feel that the given level properly addresses french interests ? 
  if it 's not the case that this sort of scenario would be in any one member 's interest , would it make sense to establish policy to prevent that from happening , to avoid a public good problem ? 
   or they 're so small that no matter what they spent it 's not going to significantly strengthen the alliance ; do we really want to beat up on netherlands and lithuania for not having legions of doom ? 
  this logic does n't make sense . 
  the eu has a whole has a gdp on par with the us . 
  if you split it up into small groups and say `` no one group 's spending matters , because the group is small '' , you can see why this would lead to incompatible conclusions . 
  obviously , lithuania 's military is going to be smaller than the us 's or france 's -- but that does n't mean that it 's unreasonable to expect members to be able to provide some sort of capabilities roughly tied to gdp or something similar . 
   if i 'm being really honest , the main function of the 2 % spending target is to give bitter americans an official reason to piss and moan about muh pussy europeans and something to blame the deficit on . 
  i 'd say that it was an attempt from within the nato military hierarchy to arrest the continued slide in resources . 
  the us has also complained directly to major eu members , including france and the uk , about spending . 
  i do n't think that this is for domestic consumption purposes . 
   the eu is not a defense organisation . 
  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/sede/dv/sede200612mutualdefsolidarityclauses_/sede200612mutualdefsolidarityclauses_en.pdf the lisbon treaty made it something of one , especially for attacks on non-nato eu members . 
   it is n't meant to re-unite armies . 
  just ask your little friend uk is they want that . 
  unification of armies is n't required for my point -- just an obligation to defend other eu members . 
  marksmanship competitions are n't really measuring body endurance , and they 're an olympic sport . 
  i do n't think that treated wood is particularly prone to problems like that . 
  in fact , of the few materials that i can think of that * are * : * untreated wood * [ adobe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adobe ) * [ cob ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cob_%28material%29 ) ... cob is , as far as i know , primarily a thing in the uk, 
  depends on what you 're doing with a wood house , though . 
  for example , in the us , it 's the norm to use a wood frame , and then stick drywall on that . 
  that 's inexpensive and can halt fires for some time , but have less-than-impressive sound insulation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sound_transmission_class#sound_damping_techniques  typical interior walls in homes ( 1 sheet of 1/2 \u2033 drywall on either side of a wood stud frame ) have an stc of about 33 . 
  when asked to rate their acoustical performance , people often describe these walls as `` paper thin . '', 
  they offer little in the way of privacy . 
  adding absorptive insulation ( e.g. , fiberglass batts , blow-in cellulose , recycled cotton denim batts ) in the wall cavity increases the stc to 36-39 for fiberglass to more than 50 with cotton denim , depending on stud and screw spacing . 
  doubling up the drywall in addition to fiberglass insulation can yield stc 41-45 , provided the wall gaps and penetrations are sealed properly . 
  [ citation needed ] and  due to their high mass , concrete and concrete block walls have good tl values ( stcs in the 40s and 50s for 4-8 \u2033 thickness ) but their weight , added complexity of construction , and poor thermal insulation tend to limit them as viable materials in most residential wall construction , except in temperate climates and hurricane or tornado-prone areas .

  germany 's debt dropped as a percent of gdp over world war i ? 
  that sounds ... unexpected . 
  to be fair , / u/sea _ the_see is probably talking about nato spending targets and/or eu collective defense responsibilities . 
  that being said , it seems reasonable to me . 
  it 'd be cheaper and easier for everyone involved to deter an attack than to have to retake land . 
  we 're already on the hook to retake it if it 's attacked . 
  does n't mean that seeing if something can be done with spending minimums would be a bad idea , though . 
  if nato does n't do it , at some point the eu ( or , i guess , some other european organization ) is probably going to have to do it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haggis#outside_scotland  in 1971 it became illegal to import haggis into the us from the uk due to a ban on food containing sheep lung , which constitutes 10 to 15 % of the traditional recipe . 
  [ 24 ] the situation was further complicated in 1989 when all uk beef and lamb was banned from importation to the us due to a bse crisis . 
  [ 24 ] in 2010 a spokeswoman for the us department of agriculture stated that they were reviewing the ban on beef and lamb products , but that the ban on food containing sheep lung would remain in force . 
  [ 24 ] http://munchies.vice.com/articles/the-usda-doesnt-want-us-to-eat-lungs  haggis , scotland 's national dish , has been unavailable in the united states since 1971 , when the usda issued a succinct rule : `` livestock lungs shall not be saved for use as human food . '' and  the reasoning behind the usda 's ban on lungs is generally couched in terms of food safety .

  i 'd guess that some of this is due to budget -- if you 're operating , say , a transit system , you get budget x , and with some of that you can fund a police force . 
  i 'm pretty sure that it 's normal around the world to have municipal police separate from national police , probably for that reason .
