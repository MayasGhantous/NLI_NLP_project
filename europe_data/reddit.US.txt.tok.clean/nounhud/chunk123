  i 'd guess that there 's some skill specialization when it comes to forestry law enforcement versus tracking down escaped prisoners . 
  i do n't really know why it 's not a single hierarchy with specialization under that , though . 
  i suppose that would be possible . 
  never looked at other countries to see whether they have a different law enforcement structure . 
  i * do * know that some of these have continued to exist with a changed mandate ( e.g. 
  the [ secret service ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_secret_service ) has bounced through a wide range of responsibilities , but continued to exist as a single unit . 
  might just be organizational inertia . 
  i assume that every time some department is established in the eu today , that nobody in it is going to want it to be dissolved . 
   the military refused to speculate in whether it could have be placed there by terrorists . 
  well , that 's certainly a dick move in terms of getting a good headline . 
  how about speculating on whether it could have been placed there by aliens ? 
  i do n't know what the comment was , but i assume that it was n't complaining about the re-emergence of [ scouting in russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scouting_in_russia ) . 
  there 's fault on both sides if impossible quotas show up . 
  there should have been pushback from the companies on the impossible quotas . 
  if the goals * are * that unrealistic and the government refuses to listen to input from those companies or care , then they should have either had a media campaign to convince the public , or bit the bullet and made bad , conformant cars ( and exposed any competitors making non-conformant cars ) . 
  * not * showing resistance just means that the standards get progressively more-disconnected from what 's actually possible . 
  if you 're counting polish-americans and you 're talking about the metro area , chicago is above that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles_in_chicago  as of the 2000 u.s. census , poles in chicago are the largest european american ethnic group in the city , making up 7.3 % of the total population . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] however , according to the 2006 -- 2008 american community survey , german americans and irish americans each had slightly surpassed polish americans as the largest european american ethnic groups in chicago . 
  [ citation needed ] german americans made up 7.3 % of the population , and numbered at 199,789 ; irish americans also made up 7.3 % of the population , and numbered at 199,294 . 
  polish americans now made up 6.7 % of chicago 's population , and numbered at 182,064 . 
  [ 5 ] ** however , polish americans are , by far , the largest european american ethnic group in the chicago metropolitan area , with as many as 1.5 million claiming polish ancestry ** . 
  in addition , polish americans in chicago have a recent history of family members who came from poland as many are first or second generation poles as compared to many other ethnics who are third or fourth generation . 
  polish is the third largest speaking language in chicago behind english and spanish . 
  i wonder what happens if your friends like to race yachts . 
  hmm . 
  instead of `` at risk of '' , which would seem to leave room for creative definitions , would n't it make more sense to look at actual below-poverty-level percentages ? 
   americans are a great example of this . 
  citation required . 
   a normal investigation would have had numeous pressers already telling us about the findings so far . 
  hmm . 
  are you sure ? 
  it was one week ago , and my understanding is that at least in some past incidents , part of the forensics involves reassembling the plane parts , which takes a while . 
  if you 're searching for an anti-republican circlejerk , / r/politics is probably going to be a more-effective choice . 
  normally they deal with domestic stuff , yeah . 
  however , it 's the main federal police force in the us ( [ though there are no shortage of others ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_law_enforcement_in_the_united_states ) ) , and if you wanted to pull in forensics capabilities , i suspect that the fbi is who you 'd pull in . 
  i am wondering how many people will take the opportunity to loot . 
  the [ world health organization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita#who_statistics ) has : | country | liters per year per capita for age 15 + | | - | - | | ukraine | 13.9 | | united kingdom | 11.6 | | denmark | 11.4 | also , except finland and estonia , the nordic countries do n't drink much compared to the rest of europe . 
  i would give reasonable odds that this is for domestic political reasons . 
   the irish invented chocolate milk , the tattoos machine and whiskey . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samuel_o'reilly  samuel f. o\u2019reilly was born in waterbury , new haven , connecticut to irish immigrants thomas o\u2019reilly and mary ann hurley in may of 1854 . 
  [ 1 ] you lose your rights to complain about irish-americans calling themselves irish . 
  the [ hot dog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hot_dog ) , though :  the sausages were culturally imported from germany and popularized in the united states , where they were a working class street food sold at hot dog stands that came to be associated with baseball and america . 
  i 'm skeptical . 
  the us [ stopped the uk , france , and israel from taking it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suez_crisis ) , probably just about the three countries in the world that the us would * least * object to seizing it . 
  if russia tries to seize the suez : * the us is going to become involved . 
  * the countries of europe , which have a strong interest in not letting russia control their access to the indian ocean , will become involved . 
  * china , which probably does n't want its primary shipping routes to europe to be grabbed , will probably not be happy . 
  we also live in an era where computer analysis can aid in detecting computer-generated fakes , like looking for artifacts from different source pictures that come from lossy formats , detecting lighting oddities , etc. 
  http://fotoforensics.com/ http://www.izitru.com/ http://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/jpeg-snoop-identify-edited-photos.html i remember some of the [ analysis that went into disproving the hoax bush letters ] ( http://www.flounder.com/bush2.htm ) . 
  also , if your media source publishes bogus stuff enough times , it 's possible for websites to highlight your bad claims , and you can lose a reputation of trust . 
  it takes time and effort to establish your brand . 
  unless you 're going to rely on propagating content anonymously or virally , without a trusted brand endorsing it , you 're stuck with that problem . 
  or just have a comedy show acting out said myths . 
   they sold the thinkpad lineup to lenovo who fucked it up . 
  apparently the cries of anguish actually made it through and lenovo backed off on the `` one button trackpad '' thing and is providing three discrete buttons again . 
  that 's * kind * of a broad reading of what was said . 
  between [ the claw ] ( http://www.som.com/projects/nato_headquarters ) and the hexagon , europe 's on a new military headquarters roll . 
  i kinda would be interested to see photo comparisons of military headquarters around the world . 
   the summit conclusion lists two short-term legal migration projects that should be concluded before the end of 2016 . 
    it says the number of scholarships to the eu should be doubled and also calls for the launch of pilot projects on legal migration . 
  that not only educates ( improving the situation in africa ) but some percentage will stay , thus supporting skilled migration -- that seems like it 's in eu interests to me . 
  stopping until the security system has been evaluated * or * because it has been evaluated and been found to be seriously lacking is n't crazy . 
  losing an airplane and a couple hundred people is pretty expensive . 
  if you think that it 's going to happen again , it 's reasonable to inconvenience people . 
  which provides the ability to claim asylum , which normally does not exist . 
  so ... i 'm curious . 
  the med is not that large , and it does n't take * that * much time for a ship to cross it . 
  how popular is passenger ship travel from , say , cyprus ? 
  that kinda seems like a big opportunity for passenger shipping companies . 
  i do n't particularly think so . 
  if ford screwed up , * i * would n't be embarrassed about it . 
  ford execs might be , but i 'm not responsible for their errors . 
  and honestly , these are just not that big a deal . 
  they 'll get a fine and go back to business . 
  it 's not as if their cars were dangerous for the driver or passengers , which would discourage people from purchasing them . 
   those against immigration wo n't be happy because the number coming in wo n't drop why do you say that ? 
  it should reduce the pull factor to at least some degree . 
  i do n't know whether it will be sufficient to dominate other factors , but it seems very plausible for it to generate downwards pressure . 
  i assume that it is at least as hard to get into ireland as it is the uk -- that is , probably lots of smuggling via small boat across the english channel , but not an obvious and legal way in . 
   most countries continue to pretend that it 's not their problem . 
  i think that a number of countries are n't pretending that it 's not their problem , but that their favored policy is to do whatever is required to keep people out of the eu entirely , and they feel that germany in adopting a particular strategy ( try and spread people out who entered illegally ) has adopted a solution that is in conflict with the solution that they want . 
  i do agree that there * is * onus on people who do n't want solution x to provide viable solution y , though . 
  i also liked the the * blade runner * music , like the [ end theme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cws12z2jbw ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that it 's not ten-year-olds mostly pushing that average up , though . 
  us alcohol consumption is lower than europe 's average . 
  it certainly transferred wealth from the public to lenders , at any rate . 
  the reason you heard about it in the context of the us political scene recently is because each party wants a blank check to dump money where it wants when it is in power and it made for a nice political cover . 
  i 'm not * sure * that it 's exactly what you mean , though . 
  if i were going to tell a lighthearted joke , but that joke is flavored with my true feelings , that would be `` only part tongue-in-cheek '' . 
  an example might be : `` if the european union federalizes , the french will just make every school serve french cheese ! '', 
  where the statement is intended to be absurd and be laughing at how silly the idea is ... but where i 'm a bit worried that something like that might indeed happen . 
  those true , serious feelings are n't necessarily * sarcastic * , though . 
  it 's more like `` i 'd like to make a joke , but i 'm not entirely able to pull it off because i partly believe that the joking scenario might actually happen . '', 
  palestinians are n't ( broadly-speaking ) black . 
  i ca n't think of a single phrase . 
  in appropriate context , maybe `` only part tongue-in-cheek '' , indicating that something is * partly * joking ... but that the seriousness is also showing through . 
  i do n't know german , so i 'm going off your english-language description of the word . 
  somehow , britain has staggered along thus far without a gestapo . 
  i think that it could probably manage even longer .
