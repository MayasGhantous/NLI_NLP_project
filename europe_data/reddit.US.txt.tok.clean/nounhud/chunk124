  well , we knew that this sort of thing would come up one day , when the technology permitted it , so i guess that this is just an overdue discussion . 
  one that i like ? 
  maybe the greek [ vangelis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vangelis ) ( e.g. 
  [ * chariots of fire * theme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csav51fvlku ) ) . 
  [ and i thought that the * ghost dog * car theft opening scene was silly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltydsrqijhw&amp;t=24s ) . 
   agreed , helping the less fortunate in any way that we can is a good first step towards a more equal planet instead of spening it all on personal luxury !, 
  mexico is roughly at the global average income level . 
  if your ideal would be to convert your country to mexico to alleviate feelings of guilt over your good situation , it 's certainly your right to advocate for such a policy . 
  but i think that most people in the developed world would not agree with such a policy . 
  time to rejoin the uk , i guess , ireland . 
  i wonder if it 's possible to provide any sort of a plausible estimate on how much economic damage corruption causes a country and on what kind of return this is producing . 
   sad fact is that georgia is n't worth starting a conflict between russia and nato starting a conflict to defend a non-nato member would probably be disadvantageous for nato , because it would set a precedent that one could get nato protection without having to also contribute ; that 'd harm the coalition as other countries say `` yeah , i think i 'll do the same thing '' . 
  afaik , it 's not currently normal for commercial aircraft to land autonomously . 
   they 're just bigger , armed rc planes . 
  nah , [ they can operate fully-autonomously ] ( http://www.ga-asi.com/predator-b ) . 
  well , at least the navigation -- i dunno about weapons usage . 
  your broader point , that the software is n't remotely-capable of learning enough to take over the world , does stand . 
  nah , you can snackexchange from anywhere to anywhere . 
  just in your post request that people from region x respond . 
  adopt a [ presidential system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidential_system ) and you can enjoy the same frenzied , all-in election-time campaigning , as well as a national leader who is n't paralyzed in crises . 
  ` course , the flip side is that you have to put up with unpopular leaders for extended periods of time . 
    about 80 percent were originally atheist or catholic ; some are even jewish . 
    this is an interesting piece of information . 
  90-95 % of france is non-muslim . 
  it seems more that religion just is n't as a significant factor as one might have thought . 
  i guess you could be an anarchist or some other revolutionary later or be one of those guys that goes to wto things and riots ... but if you want to fight the system , i guess joining a group fighting for world revolution sounds pretty exciting . 
  not a lot of public oversight , so it 's hard for me personally to say much of anything . 
  i really have a difficult time getting that worked up about bullfighting . 
  even if one greatly objects to pain in the animal , it 's no worse than an animal would be likely to have had in the wild -- and i do n't see people demanding that animals be removed from the wild to avoid them suffering unpleasant deaths . 
  in the case of bullfighting , it 's simply visible to many humans . 
  it seems rather like saying `` i do n't want the possibility that pain might be visible to me '' , which sounds a bit less high-minded . 
  technically , an estimate of one hundred years , give-or-take a hundred years '' is accurate . 
  not very precise , but accurate . 
  i see that the nyt is busy framing the discussion . 
  how do you know this ? 
  like ... i have a certain amount of cynicism about my political system , sure . 
  and there are cases where we can definitely identify real corruption . 
  there are cases where we can find [ statistical evidence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/match-fixing_in_professional_sumo#previous_speculation ) of collusion or corruption . 
  perhaps someone 's wealth is clearly out-of-whack with their income and previous wealth . 
  if there 's a history of corruption being discovered , certainly it 's reasonable to make assumptions about it still being present . 
  but if there 's a shadowy , well-hidden conspiracy , how is the public to * know * that such a thing is present ? 
  i have seen a number of romanians make very strong statements about corruption that continues to exist in their government -- not stuff that dna or a similar organization has exposed , but existing corruption . 
  what makes you so certain that this is the case ? 
  i would assume that unless the president or parliament intentionally wants to trigger elections , that wo n't happen . 
  the two can presumably communicate about their choice and agree privately , after all . 
   i just want to contest the ( lazy , intellectually dishonest , unscholarly ) idea that modern humanities are opaque nonsense . 
  you do n't need to contest it , because i never stated it . 
  there is work in philosophy that i am quite impressed with . 
  i think that economics and psychology have plenty of work that is entirely-reasonable and on par with that in other fields . 
  there is also less-than-impressive work in the social sciences , but i can go dig up a book on metaphysics that reasons about the nature of reality in a helpful way and does not misuse terminology from other fields . 
  my complaint was specific to one field . 
  cartesian dualism is not a synonym for `` binary '' . 
  cartesian dualism is specifically the idea in philosophy that the mind has some essential , non-material essence that exists in some real way in separation from the physical brain . 
  my own intense suspicion is that the reason it was used in that paper was because it sounded authoritative , impressive , even though it is a misuse of the term . 
  that is * exactly * what sokal was demonstrating with his hoax -- he took a lot of utter gibberish , slapped together words that referenced prestigious-sounding concepts in other sciences , attached a particular conclusion in-line with the political positions of the editors , and shipped it off and they bought into it . 
  he was upset that this sort of thing was happening to such an extent . 
  i 'm * also * upset that it is happening . 
  i think that it * severely weakens * the humanities to have this sort of thing considered acceptable . 
  i remember reading an article written by a feminist in ... oh , probably the early eighteen-hundreds or so . 
  it was solid . 
  it made a case for why women should be attending school . 
  it said things like `` i do n't claim that women and men are all equally good at all things , but i am certain that if women are restricted from * trying * , they can not do well in this field , '' and cited examples of where a few women had done well in some scholarly fields when they 'd actually gone through the curriculum . 
  that 's something that i can thoroughly respect . 
  that woman was making a well-reasoned argument against inefficiency . 
  she provided supporting evidence . 
  if you wanted to , you could test her statement . 
  the argument would make sense in any field . 
  if this was what feminism today consisted of , i 'd be an enthusiastic proponent of all things that fall under feminism . 
  however , * absolutely batshit insane drivel * comes out under the banner of academic feminism . 
  let 's take a look at the wikipedia article for [ `` feminist geography '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feminist_geography ) , which quotes some material from the field :  '' ` cartesian dualism underlines our thinking in a myriad of ways , not least in the divergence of the social sciences from the natural sciences , and in a geography which is based on the separation of people from their environments . 
  thus while geography is unusual in its spanning of the natural and social sciences and in focusing on the interrelations between people and their environments , it is still assumed that the two are distinct and one acts on the other . 
  geography , like all of the social sciences , has been built upon a particular conception of mind and body which sees them as separate , apart and acting on each other ( johnston , 1989 , cited in longhurst , 1997 , p. 492 ) '   thus , too , feminist work has sought to transform approaches to the study of landscape by relating it to the way that it is represented ( ` appreciated ' so to speak ) , in ways that are analogous to the heterosexual male gaze directed towards the female body ( nash 1996 ) . 
  both of these concerns ( and others ) - about the body as a contested site and for the cartesian distinction between mind and body - have been challenged in postmodern and poststructuralist feminist geographies . '', 
  none of this makes * any fucking sense * . 
  it 's philosophical gobbledygook , name-dropping keywords from different fields . 
  cartesian dualism has nothing to do with separating the social and natural sciences . 
  drawing analogies to `` the heterosexual male gaze directed towards the female body '' does n't clarify anything . 
  it 's the worst of what the [ sokal affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sokal_affair ) exposed -- people trying to write unreadable , nonsense papers to impress other people with their opaqueness -- combined with trying to claim policy-setting authority in society . 
  i am personally doubtful that [ `` women 's studies '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women's_studies ) warrants an academic field . 
  it might be something where someone could occasionally engage in advocacy , but if a person chooses to devote * their lives and career to it * , to create an * entire academic field * around it ... well , now you 've got a situation where you 've filtered political advocates into one area where they can all affirm the value of each others ' work and then go off and create castles in the air that increasingly diverge from reality . 
  on the silver lining side , this probably means that there 's an easier route than expected to address respiratory issues in europe . 
  i do n't know . 
  this would probably impact those living abroad at * least * as much as other britons . 
  the leadership probably impacts those abroad less than britons living in the uk . 
  moving to us levels of welfare does n't solve this . 
  i mean , it might * mitigate * it , but there 's a fundamental difference . 
  the us has millions of illegal immigrants . 
  these come into the country as illegal immigrants . 
  they do n't get welfare . 
  they have kids , who are legal us citizens ( due to [ * jus soli * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) ) , and that generation grows up with schooling and education . 
  the us pretends that the illegal immigrants are n't there , and so there 's a sort of one-generation `` second-class citizen '' that does n't get welfare . 
  that 's seen as a worthwhile tradeoff by illegal immigrants , who get access to a lucrative labor market and whose kids get us citizenship . 
  it was never an * approved * route to get citizenship , but since it 's a win for everyone involved other than for the native unskilled labor market , everyone just winks at it . 
  but the current migrant crisis has sweden doling out asylum and permanent residency . 
  these people are thus no longer present illegally , and thus sweden is on the hook to provide welfare . 
  and , at least as long as they are present for asylum ( not sure if the permanent residency bit applies ) , sweden is treaty-bound to provide welfare as extensive as that provided to its citizens . 
  there is n't a `` second-class illegal worker '' , and without that , i 'm not sure that the process is still viable . 
   after all , they were bringing modernity and civilisation to these poor fellas . 
  well , that was the popular rationale , at any rate . 
  i imagine that the people running companies that dealt with the colonies were more interested in striking it rich .
