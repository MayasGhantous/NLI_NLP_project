  were you wanting to make an opec or a united states of europe ? 
  because , if the eu has cartel control over some critical good , it could act as opec . 
  nothing magic there . 
  if you want a united states of europe , well , that seems like a pretty straightforward path . 
  if you want one person to swing a lot of military clout , you 're probably going to need to bump military spending and act as one from a military standpoint . 
  if you want economic clout ... well , you 've got that . 
  that 's what is being applied to russia in the form of sanctions right now . 
  this appears to have been the status quo for the past [ thirteen years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_open_skies ) . 
  it seems like it would be more news if the flight did n't take place . 
  this does already cover europe , fwiw ( in fact , when i first saw it back when , it was heavily used by people swapping snacks between the us and europe ) . 
   nato is n't a nation either , yet if a threat such as this was made against one of their members a response would made . 
  * a country is almost certainly not going to invoke article 5 over migrants being dumped at their border . 
  * i doubt that nato members are bound to respond , as this probably is n't considered an attack . 
  * border control * is * something that is shared between eu and a country , but is not within nato 's scope of responsibility . 
  my guess is that if a nato member * did * request aid in an emergency , it could get it , but it would n't go through the formal nato request route . 
  nato is n't and should n't be a `` the eu is n't doing what i want , so now i 'm going to go to nato and get * it * to solve the problem '' alternative . 
  it 's a defense alliance . 
  yeah , in an emergency it can stretch a bit , but nato would make for a bad answer to `` there 's some problem with the political functioning of the eu '' . 
  in a lot of cases , people objected strenuously to the eu exceeding its authority . 
  what if nato does so ? 
  not everyone is going to like what nato does , and some people will object to it . 
  the answer to `` the eu is n't doing x which i want '' should be `` fix the eu , then '' , not `` second-guess it with nato '' . 
  you could say that turkey has kept some 2.5 m refugees from reaching europe . 
  if i remember correctly , kingofcanadia strongly dislikes the us too -- he 's a fan of russia . 
   the league is very well when sparrows shout , but no good at all when eagles fall out . 
  -- benito mussolini that being said , i think that your statement is overly-cynical . 
  international law is , more-or-less , followed by countries , whether they 're powerful or not . 
  i think that the world would be worse-off if it lacked a standard , written set of rules for resolving , say , maritime issues . 
  otherwise , hard for people to plan around any sort of predictable behavior . 
  i remember that one occasion , and some people here speculating about it happening on another . 
  i 'm not sure that it 's common . 
  `` as we know it '' sounds like [ weasel words ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weasel_word ) to me . 
  or just political fluff . 
  works for me . 
  you just keep picking up the religious ones and sending the well-educated , secular turks our way so that we do n't burden you . 
  i realize that pedophilia pushs a lot of buttons , but the british media provides what seems to me like an extraordinary amount of coverage , much more than the us or any other media source i read . 
  hmm . 
  i 'm not completely sure what your answer to my post was ; i think that perhaps we 're getting sidetracked in what might be done with the money . 
  i 'm just asking whether you feel that there is * some * point where debt ( albeit debt denominated in the country 's currency ) starts to become a problem . 
  it may be very large , but the issue is just whether you would say that there is some such point , or whether you 'd say that there is * no * level at which it would become a concern . 
  / u/kalugra seems to be finnish . 
  finland 's economy is n't * that * large . 
   why would `` russia '' be responsible because someone is going to probably pay some lawyers and the families of the people who died a great deal of money , and a lot of organizations would like to not be the payer . 
  egypt felt that in [ egyptair flight 990 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egyptair_flight_990 ) , the problem was a mechanical failure ( which i assume would place either boeing or the maintenance company on the hook ) . 
  the us felt that it was the co-pilot crashing the airplane into the ocean ( which would place the airline on the hook ) . 
  i imagine that in most international air crashes , there 's some of this sort of dancing around going on . 
   and thus should be repatriated to their place of historical origin which is northern india . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people  they originated in northern india and arrived in mid-west asia , then europe , around 1,000 years ago , [ 44 ] either separating from the dom people or , at least , having a similar history ; [ 45 ] the ancestors of both the romani and the dom left north india sometime between the sixth and eleventh century . 
  [ 44 ] got ta be honest : if we 're going to go back a full millennium , most of the world 's population probably was n't where it is today . 
   blaming the accident on the victims for celebrating halloween is halloween in romania religious in any way ? 
  all hallows ' eve still have some sort of connection ? 
  because in the us , the modern halloween is a secular holiday . 
   so they will do those things to get attention and make their point . 
  does it produce public support for limits on immigration , though ? 
  the use of violence has often turned off people from supporting a public movement . 
  and at the end of the day , unless a group is planning a violent takeover ( heck , even then ) , their main goal must be to win support , if they plan to produce change . 
  okay , but sufficient deficits will over time lead to debt . 
  would you agree that that sufficiently large deficits , even in a controlled currency , would be an issue ? 
  let 's say that this year , i run a deficit of 20 % of gdp . 
  i do so the next year , and the next year , and so on . 
  the debt accruing from this is denominated in a currency that i control , as i have issued bonds with payment terms given in that currency . 
  would you say that this does n't matter ? 
   if you only agree to take on debt in a currency that you control , you 'll never run out of money , never fail to pay your debts , and do n't have to worry about hyperinflation . 
  hyperinflation only happens when you do not control the currency you owe debts in . 
  you ca n't get an infinite spiral of inflation without ability to ever eliminate the debt , that 's true . 
  but saying `` debt does n't matter '' is a stronger statement than just `` you can pay down the debt '' . 
  i described two points above -- ways in which the wealth of your citizens and organizations and businesses would be impacted , and ways in which future trust in your currency 's stability would be impacted . 
  neither of those relies on the debt being denominated in a foreign currency to create real issues . 
   there will never be a party with which i agree a 100 % that 's a good point . 
  anti-nuclear positions are something that i disagree with , but aside from maybe [ impact on a country 's power generation industry ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/business/global/19iht-siemens19.html ) , they are n't something that i 'd expect to have long-term impact . 
  if people decide `` oh , that was n't a good idea '' , they can always construct new plants ( or just buy power from another country , i suppose ) . 
  just out of curiosity , what is the rest of the german pirate party 's platform that you disagree with ? 
  i hear very little about proposals from any of those parties outside of their privacy/online policy/intellectual policy stuff , so i assumed that they more-or-less supported the * status quo * . 
   reagan and thatcher both pretty well proved that deficits do n't matter when you 've got a fiat currency . 
  well ... i 'm not an economist , but if you induce inflation , you 're draining real wealth from everyone holding assets linked to your currency , which is probably mostly people and institutions in your country -- bonds , bank accounts , etc. 
  so if the idea is `` ah , i can just create massive inflation , my debts shrink in real terms , no impact '' , that does n't seem quite right . 
  and in terms of impact ... if i start to believe that you 're a risk for just wiping some of your debts via fiddling with your currency , i and other people have pretty good reason to price that risk into your future debt we purchase . 
  i 'll bet that zimbabwe has a harder time floating bonds than the us does , for example . 
  i believe that you are incorrect -- here 's a [ source that includes some more of the details ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20151023/police-collar-nazis-who-planned-refugee-fire-attacks ) :  there have been 576 offences targeting refugee hostels since the start of the year , ** including cases of criminal damage and inciting hatred ** , 523 of which were committed by far-right extremists , it added . 
  `` inciting hatred '' would be hate speech . 
  this is the total for all such crimes . 
  as i recall from the reddit discussion on that statistic , that was a very inclusive metric -- `` crime '' here could include , say , verbal abuse . 
  [ the roman empire extended asylum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gothic_war_%28376%e2%80%93382%29#background ) :  in the summer and autumn of 376 , tens of thousands [ citation needed ] of displaced goths and other tribes arrived on the danube river , on the border of the roman empire , requesting asylum from the huns . 
  fritigern , a leader of the thervingi , appealed to the roman emperor valens to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the danube , where they hoped to find refuge from the huns , who lacked the ability to cross the wide river in force . 
  valens permitted this , and even helped the goths cross the river , [ citation needed ] probably at the fortress of durostorum ( modern silistra ) , bulgaria . 
   the gallup poll , based on data compiled from more than 450,000 interviews in 151 nations from 2009 to 2011 , found that in nigeria , which already has double the population of germany , 40 percent of people would emigrate to the west if they could . 
  and the lesson of 2015 -- for them and much of the world -- is that they can . 
  i 'm amazed that 60 % would n't , to be honest . 
   to me that 's an imprecise usage . 
  not so much imprecise , i suspect , as due to historical inertia . 
  let 's say that in the sixties or somewhere thereabouts , everyone says `` okay , having the government own and operate all industry is n't such a great idea . 
  but we 're still concerned about the same * real * principle , which is appealing to the less-well-to-do and offering them a bigger slice of the pie . 
  do we rebrand ? 
  that 'd be costly . 
  best not to risk change as long as things are working all right . '', 
   but no one seems to realize what that really means < orders another pizza instead of sending money to feed someone starving in the third world  i realize it . 
  i just do n't dwell on it . 
   she has said it would be hard to quantify costs since the refugee inflow and rising spending would boost economic growth . 
  sounds like it 's going to be pretty expensive , if there 's both avoidance of hard numbers * and * relying on economic growth from refugees there . 
   we know how to safely store nuclear waste .
