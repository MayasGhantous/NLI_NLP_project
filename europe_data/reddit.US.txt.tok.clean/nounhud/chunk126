   the absolute worst disaster non-nuclear energy can create would be a big dam failing catastrophically . 
  not a failure ( actually , from the standpoint of the dam 's structural integrity , a massive success ) , but i like the [ vajont dam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vajont_dam ) wikipedia article :  the vajont dam as seen from the village longarone in 2005 , showing approximately the top 60 -- 70 metres of concrete . 
  the wall of water that overtopped the dam by 250 metres ( 820 ft ) [ 1 ] and destroyed the villages would have obscured virtually all of the sky in [ this photo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vajont_dam#/media/file:la_diga_del_vajont_vista_da_longarone_18-8-2005.jpg ) . 
  [ 2 ] imagining sitting where the photographer was and looking up at the wall of water is pretty terrifying . 
  i can understand it from green advocacy groups , like greenpeace or sierra club or something . 
  their entire existence is dependent upon there being an ongoing problem to fight . 
  if anything , for them it 's preferable to have an just-out-of-reach goal . 
  but from a * political party * , that seems strange -- i 'd think that the political party would have to come up with viable proposals . 
  you 'd think that this would be a really good time for finnish tech startups : lots of it people wandering around . 
  is n't the german green party really opposed to nuclear power generation ? 
   that would be simply throwing money away . 
  [ throwing money away ( buying vs renting ) ] ( http://messymatters.com/buyrent/ ), 
   in layman 's terms there 's quite literally nowhere left to invest it that makes financial sense when considering returns - bonds are almost worthless , stocks are expensive considering average dividends etc. 
  i ca n't help but think that somewhere in the world , there 's someone who wants to start a business but lacks capital to do so . 
  | country | average household net-adjusted disposable per-capita income ( usd ) | | - | - | | [ slovenia ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/slovenia/ ) | $ 19,326 | | [ sweden ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/sweden/ ) | $ 29,185 | they will probably make more money in sweden than in slovenia . 
  wanting to get to sweden before it gets too cold is , i think , a different issue from choice of country . 
  also the [ wikipedia article for china airlines flight 611 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/china_airlines_flight_611 ) . 
   `` in light of how he carried out the criminal act , and his emotional state as he himself has described it , is is clear that he was compelety indifferent as to whether or not his violence would lead to death for those two people he attacked , '' he said . 
  that seems unlikely -- i mean , normally when you stab someone with a knife , i 'd sort of think that it 's because you 'd like them to die . 
  got give snowden a hand -- he 's nothing if not willing to take risks at cost to himself . 
  < he gets a cushy job in the us  `` the us is doing x wrong . '', 
  < russia gives him asylum  `` russia is doing y wrong . '', 
  < the eu puts up a non-binding vote to not extradite him  `` the uk is doing z wrong . '', 
   britain is not multicultural . 
  multicultural means there is a mix of culture 's , there is n't ... and then some people from third world countries or ancestry from third world counntries who totally segregate themselves . 
  hmm . 
  the word `` multicultural '' is not really a term that shows up in the us political lexicon , but as it 's used in the british , i really thought that it meant effectively the opposite of what you 're talking about . 
  that is , * instead * of integrating people , [ multiculturalism involves keeping separate , distinct cultures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiculturalism ) . 
   multiculturalism describes the existence , acceptance , or promotion of multiple cultural traditions within a single jurisdiction , usually considered in terms of the culture associated with an ethnic group ... multicultural ideologies and policies vary widely , [ 1 ] ranging from the advocacy of equal respect to the various cultures in a society , to a policy of promoting the maintenance of cultural diversity , to policies in which people of various ethnic and religious groups are addressed by the authorities as defined by the group to which they belong . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   multiculturalism that promotes maintaining the distinctiveness of multiple cultures is often contrasted to other settlement policies such as social integration , cultural assimilation and racial segregation . 
  multiculturalism has been described as a `` salad bowl '' and `` cultural mosaic '' . 
   gabriel warned that `` the longer the dispute in the [ european ] union lasts , more people will turn away from politics and right-wing extremists will gain more ground . '' i do n't agree . 
  there are certainly negatives to having public divisions in government ( and in a political coalition ) , but why would someone who is opposed to immigration turn away from government * because * someone in government is raising their concerns ? 
  and surely the csu would tend to retain voters who would otherwise shift to a less-mainstream anti-immigration party ? 
  if europe did n't have sufficient public will to take in more refugees , qatar might wind up with them getting dumped into qatar . 
  it 's probably in qatar 's interest to try to keep the pressure up . 
  well , from a data-gathering point , comparable to * sufficient * cctv with audio tracking what you say and look at , i guess , but the fact that it 's easily machine-analyzable does change things a lot -- it greatly-expands the degree to which the government can monitor you , since it becomes much cheaper and easier . 
  i hope those int the uk never wind up with an erdogan or someone else who decides to use his powers to shut down the political opposition . 
   my hope is that russians will one day return to russia under a new leadership and push the country back up to new heights it once had . 
  right , just like how all the people who moved to the us and their descendants are going to one day return to their lands of origin . 
  i 'm rather envious of it . 
  i guess that the closest us equivalent would be * the west wing * , but the whole point of * yes , minister * is that it 's showing and joking about the interplay of politicians and bureaucrats . 
  it 's * astonishingly * disconnected from any actual political positions for a show that follows the career of a politician . 
  i guess it 's the turkish people 's decision whether-or-not to accept this . 
  from my understanding of the situation , i 'd be pretty angry if i were a turk and my government were shutting down opposition media sources , though . 
  we 'll hang onto one someday . 
   since gay marriage is an issue for a minority of the population , there 's the risk that the majority keeps voting no against something that should be a matter of equal rights . 
  a representative democracy is n't ( ideally ) to circumvent the interests of the majority , though . 
  if it 's really true that most of the population really , really does not want gay marriage and would not want it even if you sat them down and explained all the standpoints on the issue , then that 's also what their representatives should be doing . 
  [ tyranny of the majority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyranny_of_the_majority ) is either accepted or dealt with differently . 
  well not sure how relevant it is , but the efficiency benefits of representative democracy should rise as the number of people rise . 
  let 's say that i have 10 people in a direct democracy deciding an issue . 
  it takes , say , a week for a person to become fully-informed well-enough to make an informed decision . 
  so that 's ten person-weeks expended . 
  now let 's say that i have a much larger democracy , of 300 million . 
  i could elect a representative and have a representative democracy where , say , 100 people make the call . 
  then i 'd expend only one hundred person-weeks . 
  or , i could have a direct democracy and expend three hundred million person-weeks . 
  i think that it 's pretty clear that nobody can support an `` artificial islands have their own waters '' position , or you 'd have mayhem -- people would start claiming exclusive control over all sorts of the ocean . 
  i do n't know the history of china 's claim , what their legal justification is . 
  i imagine that there is one . 
  it might be that they 're claiming that these reefs are * really * islands that nobody else claimed because they have a broader definition of `` island '' than other countries . 
  well , iraq * did * invade kuwait before the gulf war . 
  this was n't just out-of-the-blue . 
  iraq ii would n't have happened had it not been for the gulf war ( though it probably was n't necessary , either ) . 
  that being said , i think that it kinda misses the point . 
  there will always be causes of unpleasantness in the world . 
  there are going to be places in the world that are going to be poor and having problems . 
  it might be fighting factions in afghanistan . 
  it might be wars . 
  it might be leadership that demands long military conscription or religious conflicts or any number of other things . 
  if those act as a key to unlock the door to living in the eu and the eu decides to extend the same generous terms that it does to its own poor , then people are simply going to come . 
  they 'd be pretty foolish not to do so . 
  i 'd do the same thing in their shoes . 
  that 's going to have some impact on the standard of living in the eu . 
  and every time there 's a new civil war or religious conflict or anything like that that lets people qualify , there will be a new wave . 
  or you end the troubles and travails of the world . 
  that seems to me like a pretty lofty and unattainable goal , but if you want to take it on and you succeed , i guess kudos to you . 
  that 's quite polite . 
  thanks for doing the research and the follow-up -- if everyone were as willing to make comments like that as you , the internet would be a friendlier place . 
   political correctness is not a left wing principle that 's a good point . 
   it is simply a set of standards for keeping discussion civil for the sake of being heard by the other side . 
  you have a much-more-positive view of political correctness than i do . 
  i think that it 's about imposing peer pressure on people to try to promote their own social norms . 
  people were worried about communism in the 1950s and wanted to make it socially-unacceptable to advocate for it . 
  they were n't worried about having civil discourse . 
  political correctness does n't prohibit saying `` that person does n't know what they 're talking about '' , which is rude and certainly harmful to keeping discourse civil . 
   you 're right , it is different in america where `` far right '' can mean libertarians or ultra conservative evangelical politics people in the us do n't normally use the terms `` far right '' , `` center-right '' , `` center '' , `` center-left '' , or `` far left '' . 
  i just use them here to be on the same page with you guys . 
  in the us , people tend to just say `` right '' , `` left '' , and maybe `` moderate '' . 
  and even those really take a back seat to `` liberal '' and `` conservative '' . 
  or even just `` republican '' and `` democrat '' , given the two-party-heavy system . 
  also , as both small - and big-l libertarianism goes in the us , i would say that it * tends * to be social-values left-of-center more than the other economically-right parties ( though again , it 's something of a catch-all group and a two-axis representation is tough ) . 
  finally , `` ultraconservative '' is n't typically used for us parties or positions either . 
  `` minor '' is n't [ age-of-consent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_consent ) , though -- it refers to [ age of majority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_of_majority ) . 
   us foreign policy you can definitely find media sources that criticize us foreign policy -- hell , in a given year , typically the publications that favor the party that is n't the president 's are doing that themselves in the us . 
   the state well , that 's kind of harder , because rejection of the state kinda implies anarchy and that 's a view without a lot of adherents these days -- not sure that you have sufficient numbers to support a large publication . 
  i 'm not sure that there * are * large publications with anarchist views . 
  but i do n't think that it 's that they are being suppressed , but more that they just are n't terrifically-popular .
