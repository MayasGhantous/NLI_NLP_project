  are you going to start re-adjusting those borders too ? 
   there will never be anything like a `` clean diesel '' and it should be clear to everybody with a basic understanding of how a diesel engine works . 
  why ca n't i filter the output ? 
  i 'd think that i could take out any particles that i object to . 
   well ; maybe a simpler way to solve the issue would be serious subsidies to develop an eu-designed and built ( i mean built in an eu country and not delocalized ) advanced electric car i do n't see the point . 
  if you set your emissions standards where the tradeoffs are too severe for diesel , i 'd think that you 'd get electrics or something else constructed anyway . 
  if they are n't too severe for diesel , might as well use diesel . 
  that might be reasonable . 
  if the standards have n't been conformed to for a long time , they might be simply disconnected from reality and it might not be realistic to meet them . 
  while i 'm sure that it 's * discouraging * , at least having real standards means that the standards are n't meaningless . 
  just wanted to point this out , because i think that there are people here who have n't looked at this from the turkish position : turkey probably is n't enthralled about a flood of refugees either . 
   `` reporting '' something that is n't there . 
  inventing things . 
  aight , so not article selection , or selecting facts or tone , but specifically making false factual claims ? 
   like that one time when washington post told that under the new russian law a person suspected of being gay can be jailed . 
  i was n't able to get hits on a site search for washington post for it . 
  i tried just searching for the last names of the politicians involved , and i got , from the major sites i see in early results : * thinkprogress : [ new law would make it illegal to come out as gay in russia ] ( http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2015/10/26/3716130/russia-coming-out-ban/ ) , a us political advocacy site ( which , afaik , is interested in domestic politics , not international ) . 
  does not say anything about just being suspected -- only people who come out . 
  * rt : [ new russian bill orders fines , arrest for public coming out as gay ] ( https://www.rt.com/politics/319466-new-russian-bill-orders-fines/ ) -- does not say anything about just being suspected -- only people who come out . 
  russian state-funded media . 
  * rbth : [ press digest : communists propose to fine gay russians for coming out ] ( http://rbth.com/international/2015/10/23/pres-digest-communists-propose-to-fine-gay-rusians-for-coming-out_533401 ) . 
  russian state-run media , does not claim that merely being suspected of being gay is sufficient for jail -- only coming out . 
  * thejournal.ie : [ russian politicians plan to outlaw coming out -- but not for `` more reasonable '' lesbians ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/russian-communist-politicians-bill-to-outlaw-coming-out-for-gay-men-2407396-oct2015/ ) . 
  i doubt that the journal is intended to primarily promote news internationally . 
  it 's certainly critical . 
  it does not claim that merely being suspected is enough to go to jail . 
  * newsweek : [ russian lgbt people could be arrested for ` coming out ' in public under new legislation ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/russian-lgbt-people-could-be-arrested-coming-out-public-under-new-legislation-335327 ) . 
  certainly critical , but this is a popular socially-left-leaning source , and it does n't look any more so than it would be with domestic social conservativism , and does n't make the claim that you mentioned ; quotes and links to izvestia , russian state-owned media . 
  * a lot of gay media : these , not unexpectedly , are pretty hostile . 
  i did n't dig through them . 
  the philippines were an unincorporated us territory . 
  i do n't think that this qualifies as a `` low intensity civil war '' , but the idea of a [ `` low intensity conflict '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/low_intensity_conflict ) is a real thing . 
  i 'm guessing that he 's talking about beria . 
  hmm . 
  so , what if turkey does the same thing to the eu ? 
   tass is fully and directly state-owned , yet i 'd be very , very surprised if they will stoop down to , ah , inventive reporting . 
  well , what do you mean by `` inventive reporting '' ? 
  take mh-17 -- that 's politically-sensitive , and we 've got the : * [ mh17 was apparently shot down by military aircraft , dutch author says ] ( http://tass.ru/en/world/768864 ) * [ russia 's channel one show satellite photo evidencing mh17 was downed by fighter jet ] ( http://tass.ru/en/world/768864 ) * [ investigators have evidence of ukrainian warplane involvement in malaysian mh17 crash -- ic ] ( http://tass.ru/en/world/768911 ) i mean , i 'll grant that some outlets are less reputable , but ... 
   detroit is already increasing ... population again [ posted : 2015-21-05 : detroit population drops again but loss is slowing ] ( http://detroit.suntimes.com/det-news/7/77/210776/detroit-population-drops-loss-slowing/ ) . 
   the population dropped just 1 % between 2013 and 2014 according to the numbers which seems to be a trend over the last few years . 
  the past decade saw drops of 2.5 % yearly , so the slow down is happening . 
  yeah -- i enjoy their articles , and they do turn up a lot of interesting material , but they 're definitely on the critical-of-the-kremlin side . 
  the `` or bodyguard '' bit seems important . 
  i think that would be redefining the term . 
  it was introduced specifically to differentiate the ussr/us situation from the earlier one . 
  my point is that if you have a three-way situation , you 're at or close to the more-traditional multipolar environment -- where there was n't any need to use the term `` superpower '' . 
   it all comes down to math , and merkel & the leftist gang 's math is shit . 
  i do n't think that this is the case . 
  i think that merkel has access to people who can work numbers , and i suspect that she herself had to do some number-crunching in her research days . 
  maybe the eu 's immigration policy is bad for any number of reasons , but i 'm awfully confident that it 's not because eu leaders ca n't manage to do basic math . 
  why ? 
  i could see tapping them , but cutting connectivity seems likely to just piss people off if it gets out . 
  russia could go arrange to have someone bomb power lines too , but they are n't going to do that . 
  although ... i have no idea what the legality of intentionally cutting a cable in international waters is . 
  not sure whether any agreement was ever signed to protect them . 
  theoretically , i suppose it might be legal to run a ship over to it , send an rov down with a bomb and blow the cable in half , though if that started happening , i suspect that countries would sign a treaty on it pretty quickly . 
  we have politicians periodically do this . 
  sometimes it becomes pretty visible , like the [ days of prayer for rain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/days_of_prayer_for_rain_in_the_state_of_texas )  the days of prayer for rain in the state of texas refers to a designated three-day period from friday , april 22 , 2011 , to sunday , april 24 , 2011 , during which texas governor rick perry asked that texans pray for `` the healing of our land [ texas ] '' and for an end to the drought . 
  i understand that voters like feeling that politicians are aligned with their interests . 
  showing that you 're part of the group by praying is one way to do that . 
  same as most photo op/pr events -- all part of the popularity game that is politics . 
   ~ ~ polish mps pray for rain to save crops ~ ~ polish mps pray for rain to get votes pretty sure that all or nearly all politicians craft a public image that differs from their private views on things . 
  are there policies in place that favor london from a business standpoint , even if there are also wealth transfers away from london ? 
   sweden is the world 's third largest arms exporter per capita . 
  only israel and russia are ahead of you . 
  sad . 
  we need to up our game . 
  i guess that could excuse russia over crimea , too . 
  i 'm not actually sure whether it 's * possible * to have lots of superpowers . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superpower  a superpower is a word used to describe a state with a dominant position in international relations and is characterised by its unparalleled ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale . 
  this is done through the means of both military and economic strength , as well as diplomatic and soft power influence . 
  if you 've got a lot of `` superpowers '' , then they all tend to counteract each other by limiting the relative strength of each other again and you 're just back to a collection of great powers again . 
  i do n't think that there 's any formal definition , but `` superpower '' was only used to describe the ussr/us situation and maybe the term after the ussr collapse . 
  if the eu and china act in that role as well , it perhaps becomes difficult to describe any one of them as superpowers -- then all of the countries just become the next [ great powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_power ) . 
   and being built on top of bubbles . 
  my understanding ( though i 'm not familiar with it ) is that china will probably see some problems due to sketchy debt and real estate prices being a bit silly , but that does n't define china 's economy alone . 
  it 's easier for china to grow than it is japan -- still lots of china that is n't developed and just needs to be brought up to modern standards . 
  easier to find improvements in china because they 're further-behind japan . 
  today they 're net-exporting tobacco to you . 
  turnabout is fair play !, 
  * libre * `` free '' or * gratis * `` free '' ? 
   congratulations to president-elect donald trump did not only come from prime ministers offices around the globe , but also from russian commentator ernest makarenko who toasts that `` america is ours ! '', 
  :-( edit : okay , [ this ] ( http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=cd23226ada1699a77000eb60b&amp;id=3020e3d627 ) kind of thing is really good , because it collects and places all the conflicting statements side-by-side . 
  i think that in that format , most people would look at the content as extremely dubious , versus reading a story a few days after reading an earlier one , where memory has already faded and it 's had to remember the precise details of the earlier claim . 
  edit2 : man , they clearly track a lot of different media outlets . 
  it might be nice to summarize what 's known about each , so that there 's a single page to link to elsewhere in referencing a given media source . 
  edit3 : hmm . 
  there are colored rows in [ the pdf digests ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/disinformation_review_18.10.2016_eng.pdf ) . 
  it 's not clear to me what the colors mean . 
  not in nafta . 
  the pacific coast was going to be in tpp , is in [ bilateral us agreements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_free-trade_agreements ) , and you guys have [ similar arrangements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) with 'em . 
   i 'm guessing not in the same way that the us wants it updated . 
  i 'm not sure that the way that trump wants to update it is the same way that trump voters want it updated . 
  trump rather avoided specifics on that point , which is a titch odd and typically one would expect that means that whatever 's in that blank is n't a selling point for him . 
  we shall see , of course . 
  trade between countries with radically-different wages is n't a problem * per se * . 
  just creates political difficulty . 
  in fact , i 'd expect countries with highly * dissimilar * characteristics trading to produce the greatest efficiency gains -- huge wage differences , one has natural resources and the other does n't , one has a lot of industry in a particular field , and so forth -- since then you can also leverage [ absolute advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/absolute_advantage ) as well as just [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) . 
   with mexico it is arbitraging the wages of the us and canada down and mexico up . 
  remember that it 's also increasing demand for products produced using labor and thus also increasing various wages .
