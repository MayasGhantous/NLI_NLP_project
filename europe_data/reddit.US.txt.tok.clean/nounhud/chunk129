  you 'd see , say , us factory worker wages fall off , because mexico has a larger relative proportion of people who can do that and are at lower wages . 
  probably a good thing if you 're a biochemist at a pharmaceutical in the us , though . 
  you know ... a lot of people in the uk voted brexit for protectionism . 
  liam fox turned around and told them that their vote was going to be for [ balls-to-the-wall free trade ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/liam-foxs-free-trade-speech ) now that their referendum vote had given him a blank check :  however , i believe the uk is in a prime position to become a world leader in free trade because of the brave and historic decision of the british people to leave the european union . 
    those who believe that the referendum was a sign of britain looking inwards have it completely wrong -- it is the beginning of britain increasing its global engagement . 
  and trump doing a never-defined nafta `` renegotiation '' which i 'm a little suspicious involves expansion and quite possibly not meaningful restriction with mexico ... 
  i 'm thinking that there are going to be some very disgruntled protectionists running around . 
  yes , you are right . 
  it 's not a matter of opinion -- i just plain threw the wrong number in . 
  thanks . 
  edit : wait , no . 
  you 're counting the uk as part of the proposed fta in one , but not the other . 
  it should be trade with one of : nafta : $ 21.9 t or esm-uk : $ 16.35 t ... so ( 21.9-16 .35 ) / 16.35 or 33.9 % larger . 
  almost spot on with my original guess once all the errors had been worked out !, 
  :-) and , yes , your point about a single market not being directly-comparable to a free trade area is fair ( and , hell , that difference may dominate the matter ) , but dammit , my response to / u/alyssas was based on just their relative sizes , so i stand by it !, 
  yeah ... but , wait a minute . 
  should n't it be the whole [ european single market ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_single_market ) minus the uk , then , not just the eu27 ? 
  that 'd be $ 19t for the esm , so $ 16.35 t , or 31.3 % bigger ? 
  ... which , amusingly-enough ... makes that initial estimate of being a third bigger almost exactly on . 
  i was not aware of that . 
  wow . 
  still , people in russia * can * at least travel internally . 
  and the majority of the population can leave the country at will . 
  hmm . 
  [ over here , freight is diesel . 
  ] ( https://reasonrail.blogspot.com/2012/05/why-freight-will-never-electrify.html ) it sounds like you guys tend to share passenger-freight lines , use a lot of passenger rail , and electric makes sense for passenger . 
  hmm . 
  i wonder how viable , / u/conducteur , it would be to switch electric rail from having the line overhead to having the line on a side . 
  that 'd let the train height be increased if need be and do that double-stacking thing . 
  it looks like ships also get ( [ by this measurement ] ( https://truecostblog.com/2010/05/27/fuel-efficiency-modes-of-transportation-ranked-by-mpg/ ) ) roughly 78 % more distance per gallon of fuel than rail . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_busiest_container_ports eleventh-busiest . 
  well , certainly not zero . 
  every country has some sort of extremists . 
  but [ wealth and religiosity are negatively-correlated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wealth_and_religion ) . 
   we also need some political entity that can credibly claim the authority to send soldiers into battle in the name of all eu citizens . 
  such a body or position does not exist . 
  a common foreign policy ? 
   having a close language and genes can make you more sympathetic to a country . 
  on the flip side , this sounds plausible too .

  maybe it 's a subtle marriage proposal . 
   the eu is just the new ussr . 
  you do n't think that you might be viewing the ussr through rose-tinted glasses here ? 
  russia was put under sanctions . 
  that 's not no response . 
  it 's just a non-military response . 
  i can . 
  maybe grimly and gloomily , like the british at the opening of world war ii , but you truly believe that france and germany would n't respond ? 
   the eu can only oppose russia via economic sanctions , and they 're already falling apart the eu is one of the wealthiest economic concentrations in the world and about 20 % of the global economy . 
  it 's not falling apart . 
  there are things it could be doing better , but that 's not the same thing . 
  how the heck would that be advantageous to italy in any way ? 
  i prefer diet coke to coke . 
  i am pretty sure that that 's just to monitor people , that it 's not the ussr-style thing where your movement had to be approved by the government and might not be granted . 
  * labor is going idle or being used inefficiently in africa . 
  when this happens , there is money to be made . 
  * the immigration pressures you face wo n't stop until either africa develops into a more-desirable place to live or a more-accessible developed location in africa shows up . 
  also , developed countries tend to have a lower birthrate , so you wo n't have countries bursting beyond carrying capacity spilling over into europe . 
  * religious and political extremism tends not to do well in wealthy , developed places . 
  the soft power form of the `` war on terror '' . 
  those are perfectly self-interested reasons to want africa to not be so screwed up . 
  the same could apply to the us vis-a-vis south america . 
  poorer than * africa * ? 
   the us is way bigger than the eu27 . 
  economically , the us is * somewhat * larger . 
  they 're in the same ballpark . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union $ 16.97 t https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom $ 2.65 t , so $ 14.32 t for the remaining eu27 . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states $ 18.558 t that 's , what , a third or so bigger ? 
  it 's larger , but not * that * much more . 
  the thing with the eu is that the other members are right next door , so shipping is cheap , travel fast , and timezones similar . 
  presidential candidates select their tone to give an impression of action . 
  he made no hard commitments as to changes made . 
  i would be very hesitant to believe that nafta will be substantially-weakened until information as to that effect comes in . 
  [ serfdom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serfdom ) requires that people be bound to the land . 
  people in russia today have free movement and are not serfs . 
  ( i know , i 'm a humorless stick-in-the-mud , but people have been throwing around terms like `` vassal '' inappropriately ) . 
  maybe . 
  i doubt it . 
  russia was willing to engage in efforts to flip a us presidential election and [ assassinate people in the uk under british protection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poisoning_of_alexander_litvinenko ) .
