  blockades are [ typically seen as an act of war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blockade#act_of_war ) . 
  i do n't see how this would advance us interests . 
  [ russia has a relatively-small merchant marine fleet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_merchant_navy_capacity_by_country ) . 
  if , hypothetically , we wound up with both sides laying mines , this would probably be a favorable sort of situation for russia -- it could cause more harm and disruption via mines for others than others could for russia . 
  i 'd prefer to stick to areas of conflict that are most-favorable to the us and to the eu , like the economic realm . 
   karelia was taken from finland because ... uhmmm ... because finns did n't allow themselves to be occupied and then allied with dem evil nazis . 
  clearly a worthy punishment for such fascists . 
  were n't the finns co-belligerants with germany in the continuation war * because * of the annexation ? 
  the order on those two events seems backwards . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dam_failure#list_of_major_dam_failures you 'll notice that we 've had our share of dam failures . 
  the most-recent italian failure was in 1985 , and the most-recent us one in 2010 . 
  granted , there 's probably also a lot more us dams out there , but i 'd want to be on fairly firm ground before taking a whack at italian dam engineering . 
  that would be the term that he * should * be using , but honestly , even that may be misleading . 
  were he to run for political office in europe , he 'd probably be considered right-of-center . 
  let 's say that he ran for office in , say , france , and proudly repeated his promise that he was going to set paid vacation to ten days a year . 
  there 'd be * riots * . 
  my guess here is that trump has successfully-established a pretty effective nationalist image . 
  but in practice , what 's he had to extend to the public to do so ? 
  not much . 
  cameron promising an eu referendum was a more-concrete-and-influential promise in that he would have the power to actually provide it and it could have an impact than anything trump has actually extended , and nobody is going to call cameron anything further right than center-right . 
  i 'm less-than-enthralled with any of them . 
  still , all three are running on image -- there are few-to-no concrete policy promises that they 've made . 
  * [ sanders on the issues ] ( https://berniesanders.com/issues/ ) * [ hillary on the issues ] ( https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/ ) * [ trump on the issues ] ( https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions ) the issues page of each is mostly just a dump of [ truisms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/truism ) , not significant , hard policy changes . 
  `` socialist '' is n't a very accurate description of sanders -- he 's offering a minor handout or two more than clinton , despite his efforts to create a different image , and while trump has gone out-of-his-way to project a tough-on-illegal-immigration image , he 's elaborately danced around having to make concrete , high-impact commitments . 
  same for clinton -- tried hard to distinguish herself via image rather than policy promises . 
  a united states run by any of them would probably look pretty similar to what exists today . 
  one of the most-interesting dam disaster stories i know of in the world was in italy , at [ vajont dam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vajont_dam ) . 
  it was n't because the dam failed -- in fact , the dam probably survived stresses beyond anything that it had been intended to handle -- but because of the unfortunate placement of the dam . 
  there was a landslide in the lake behind the dam , causing a huge `` wave '' of water overtopping the dam . 
  the [ picture wikipedia has is taken downriver of the dam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vajont_dam#/media/file:la_diga_del_vajont_vista_da_longarone_18-8-2005.jpg ) looking way , way up at the dam and a big chunk of sky and is imho rather staggering :  the vajont dam as seen from the village longarone in 2005 , showing approximately the top 60 -- 70 metres of concrete . 
  the wall of water that overtopped the dam by 250 metres ( 820 ft ) [ 1 ] and destroyed the villages would have obscured virtually all of the sky in this photo . 
  how is the length of time the country existed pre-occupation relevant to the size of the damage ? 
  military aircraft do n't always fly placidly , despite the fact that dogfights have n't been a real concern for decades and that even if they were , an su-24 would n't be taking part . 
  `` would you like to participate our our map correction program ? 
  choose ` yes ' to help improve the accuracy of our maps ! '', 
  < presses `` yes ''  somewhere back at garmin headquarters , a computer begins trying to reconcile the fact that the currently-stored speed limit for poland 's e30 motorway is 140 km/h with the fact that actual traffic speed is 1,000 km/h . 
  well , in an aircraft that might pull multiple gravities upside-down , i 'm not sure how secure that rubber band is . 
  you do n't want to lose your navigation system because you rolled your aircraft . 
  also , the batteries going out would kinda suck . 
   russian 's love trump way to go , yougov editors . 
  well , keep in mind that that 's a high-end price in one of the most-expensive places in the us . 
  it 's not going to be representative of what most prostitution in the us is like ( and almost certainly not even of what most prostitution in new york city is like ) . 
  my bet would be that prostitution prices probably vary a fair amount around the world , since it 's a hard service to export , outside of maybe [ sex tourism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex_tourism ) . 
  i 'd guess that things like paid performances via webcam are much flatter in price , since you 've a globally-competitive market . 
   so , how is prostitution like in your country ? 
  welp , going abroad from europe for the moment to provide a global perspective : [ wikipedia : prostitution in the united states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_united_states ) no federal ban , but no state or region presently permit it other than some areas in nevada . 
  there , [ it 's regulated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_law#mandatory_health_checks ) :  in nevada , state law requires that registered brothel prostitutes be checked weekly for several sexually transmitted diseases and monthly for hiv ; furthermore , condoms are mandatory for all oral sex and sexual intercourse . 
  brothel owners may be held liable if customers become infected with hiv after a prostitute has tested positive for the virus . 
  [ 36 ] prostitution outside the licensed brothels is illegal throughout the state ; all forms of prostitution are illegal in las vegas ( and clark county , which contains its metropolitan area ) , in reno ( and washoe county ) , in carson city , and in a few other parts of the state ( currently 8 out of nevada 's 16 counties have active brothels , see [ prostitution in nevada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_nevada ) ) . 
  probably happens illegally pretty broadly , given that you can find advertisements for euphemisms for illegal prostitution ( massage services , escort services ) everywhere i 've been . 
  that 's hard to enforce , since there 's no law against someone simply choosing to spontaneously have sex -- there just ca n't be legal enforcement of a * quid pro quo * payment for sex , so the only real enforcement would be the workers having access to the venues in which they work and the venues wanting to maintain their reputation . 
   [ the amount of money that is made by an escort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_united_states#escort.2fout-call_prostitution ) is different depending on race , appearance , age , experience ( e.g. , pornography and magazine work ) , gender , services rendered , and location . 
  generally , male escorts command less on an hourly basis than women ; white women quote higher rates than non-white women ; and youth is at a premium . 
  for one point of reference reflecting trends in the gay community , the gay escort agency `` topps '' , based in washington , d.c. , charges $ 150 an hour for male escorts and $ 250 an hour for transsexuals . 
  that agency takes $ 50 an hour from the contractor . 
  in larger metropolitan areas such as new york city , extremely attractive white american female escorts can charge $ 1,000 -- $ 2,000 per hour . 
  the agency takes 40 % -50 % . 
    typically , an agency will charge its escorts either a flat fee for each client connection or a percentage of the prearranged rate . 
  in san francisco , it is usual for typical heterosexual-market agencies to negotiate for as little as $ 100 up to a full 50 % of a woman 's reported earnings ( not counting any gratuity received ) . 
  most transactions occur in cash , and optional tipping of escorts by clients in most major u.s. cities is customary but not compulsory . 
  credit card processing offered by larger scale agencies is often available for a service charge . 
  here 's a table of [ global prostitution prices ] ( http://www.havocscope.com/black-market-prices/prostitution-prices/ ) ( not the cleanest data in the world , since it 's just a dump from various news articles , it 's undated , it 's far from directly-comparable and many are from illegal markets ) . 
  extracting the us data : | location | price | | - | - | | united states | $ 50 to $ 100 for street prostitute | | united states : high-end escort in indianapolis | $ 500 per hour | | united states : high-end escort in nyc | $ 10,000 a night | | united states : legal brothel in nevada | $ 200 to $ 600 | | united states : massage parlor | $ 200 to $ 400 for oral sex and intercourse | | united states : massage parlor worker | earnings : $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 | | united states : minnesota | $ 60 for oral sex with minor found on backpage | | united states : oregon ( ashland ) | $ 200 to $ 500 per hour ( user submitted ) | | united states : oregon ( portland ) | $ 130 | | united states : orlando | $ 300 to $ 400 per hour | | united states : pennsylvania | earnings : $ 20,00 a week | | united states : phoenix , az | $ 1,500 per day for lesbian escorts | | united states : prison guard | $ 150 charged by female guards | | united states : santa ana , ca | under $ 100 per act | | united states : silicon valley | $ 350 to $ 500 per hour | | united states : underage girls | $ 40 to $ 100 for 15 to 30 minutes of sex | | united states : washington , dc | $ 200 an hour | in a somewhat-odd legal quirk , a number of places in the us treat filming pornography as legal , but not prostitution , which creates the unusual situation where it 's entirely-legitimate to pay someone to have sex ... * if * it 's with the goal of being recorded to be watched by people later . 
  sure . 
  if you have multiple providers , it means that you can get the most-favorable rate of those providers . 
  for liquid natural gas , adding lng unloading capacity should give access to any overseas lng source in the world . 
  the only way it 's a waste to add is if you 're sure that you 're going to have lower rates available over a land-based pipeline even * without * an alternative available . 
   the facts are stark . 
  the us is awash with shale gas and is now the largest producer in the world which has made energy prices low and given us industry a competitive edge . 
    but , as i say , us industrial users , especially steel and aluminium manufacturers , are keen not to lose that competitive advantage and worry that exports will drive up domestic prices . 
  so what ? 
  `` product x in country a is currently lucrative , so we 're going to forcibly shift that profitability to product y in country a. '', 
  not beneficial for anyone in the world other than producers of product y in country a. 
  bad for consumers everywhere and producers of product x in country a. 
   there are so many stories unique to berlin - in no possible history it could have stayed that way . 
  well , suppose the ussr kept staggering along for a while longer . 
   in fact , if the queen becomes incapacitated in some way , a procedure already exists . 
  framed in 1937 legislation but originally formulated in the regency act , after george iii finally went mad in 1811 , it allows for the lord chancellor -- currently michael gove -- the speaker of the commons , the lord chief justice and the master of the rolls to step in if `` by reason of infirmity of mind or body the sovereign is incapable for the time being of performing the royal functions '' . 
  let 's hope it does not come to that . 
  that was designed for an era when the crown played a larger role in british policy . 
   besides , i rather think the daft ape was implying that there would be massive opposition at home if the usa were to say , share sovereignty with its neighbours to the north and south . 
  to be fair , that * probably * would have ultimately happened in the event of either a successful war of 1812 , and did happen in the case of various ex-mexican territories that wound up as us states . 
  another mortar reference . 
  there is a writer somewhere on * whitest kids u know * who [ really likes working mortars into their skits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct2awh-nksk ) . 
  seems like he could have kept a lower profile . 
   squandering is never a virtue . 
  it 's only squandering if you 're not getting something preferable in return . 
  gah , then you 've got russia , prussia , belarus , and notrussia . 
  if it 's more-comfortable and the fuel is affordable , sure . 
  i 'm dubious .

  which sentence on this page says that white people `` need to be punished because [ they ] are white '' ?
