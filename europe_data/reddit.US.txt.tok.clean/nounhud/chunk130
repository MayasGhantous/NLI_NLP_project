  i 'm skeptical that covert actions in montenegro would have nearly as high a bar for moscow . 
  edit : and just as a reminder , there 's no claim that this was russia . 
  the only thing that was claimed was that it was russian nationals . 
  to be fair , i would not be certain that gingrich was actually aware of any of these specifics when making his statements . 
  i suspect that estonia might just be `` the country closest to russia of all those european countries that have not been actually pulling their weight '' to him . 
  no , focusing on the positive points instead of the negative ones . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conventional_warfare conventional war is everything but `` chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons '' . 
  the wikipedia article does n't mention it , but one might add [ radiological weapons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radiological_weapon ) . 
   i hope montenegro joins nato quick nato does n't deal with coups , but attacks from an external aggressor . 
  how would joining nato address any sort of internal conflict issues ? 
  with no hugo boss outfits . 
   dumbed down their high schools ? 
  this is interesting . 
  nobody 's ever managed to develop africa yet . 
  it could change a lot of things , not least of which is the immigration issue . 
   people forget the freedoms of reddit , twitter , facebook does not equate to the freedoms a government is to provide . 
  these are privately owned corporations . 
  that 's under us law , remember . 
  the first amendment protects someone in the us against government laws , but does not restrict companies from setting any rules they please for their own services . 
  that does n't mean that the same is true in other countries -- they might legislate to mandate companies that provide a forum to not restrict speech , or might have the government require companies to restrict speech , as merkel was doing with zuckerberg a bit back . 
   we do n't have breakaway regions like that .

  sorry , an edit had the comment deleted -- was [ posting ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5cgmgk/im_now_worried_about_the_dutch_and_french/d9wckew/ ) a list of google translate english links of french-language rt articles advocating for sarkozy and criticizing jupp\u00e9 . 
  the original post was :   le pen vs juppe seems like it would be a landslide in favour of juppe , even if the current polling is somewhat off . 
    what would happen if , hypothetically , someone had obtained damaging documents on jupp\u00e9 and released them with great publicity shortly before the election ? 
   it 's not a legit issue at all , getting to 2 % is n't gon na turn european armies into powerhouses . 
  not individually , maybe , but in aggregate , it actually would make a substantial difference . 
  and aggregate is what counts , as long as members are working together . 
  [ nato 's aggregate gdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member_states_of_nato ) as of 2015 is $ 36.2 t. 
  the us 's gdp is $ 16.3 t , 45 % of that . 
  we spend 3.3 % of our gdp , or $ 595b/year . 
  everyone else in nato combined spends $ 309b/year . 
  that 's about half the us spending . 
  if everyone else made it to the 2 % level ( poland , turkey , and greece are actually above , and estonia is there , but let 's assume 2 % across-the-board ) , that 'd be $ 398b , or two-thirds the us spending . 
  shucks , you 're right , germany . 
  thanks !, 
   be not deceived ; god is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap . 
   they will sow wheat but reap thorns ; they will wear themselves out but gain nothing . 
   mars rovers . 
  theirs actually worked . 
  strictly speaking , there was that [ whole imperial units thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mars_climate_orbiter ) and then [ that other lander that did n't work ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mars_polar_lander ) and then [ the penetrators that did n't work ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep_space_2 ) . 
  sitting back until nafta renegotiation , you canuck !, 
  we know that you 're trying to slip filthy immigrants in across the northern border , and we 're not going to have any of it !, 
  the double-bacon is ashes in my mouth . 
  why is any of that a huge concern ? 
  what 's your objection to pence ? 
   it 's possible . 
  it 's possible . 
  i would certainly look at it . 
  and i 'd want more help from other people . 
  to be fair , he says that frequently when i 'm a bit suspicious that he 's got no idea of what to say in interviews . 
  senate majority leader is mitch mcconnell . 
  http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-nato-mitch-mcconnell-225955  cleveland -- senate majority leader mitch mcconnell stressed thursday that he disagrees with donald trump 's assertion that the united states should n't immediately defend nato allies , seeking to reassure the international community the u.s. would continue to come to the aid of countries in the alliance if they are attacked . 
    `` i disagree with that , '' mcconnell said in an interview with politico on thursday at the republican national convention in cleveland . 
  `` nato is the most important military alliance in world history . 
  i want to reassure our nato allies that if any of them get attacked , we 'll be there to defend them . '', 
    trump triggered an international uproar thursday -- and a rebuke from many republican officials -- when the gop nominee said he would n't automatically come to the defense of america 's nato allies if they are attacked . 
    trump made the comments in a new york times interview published late wednesday . 
  when asked about the threat russia poses to smaller baltic nations , trump said the united states should defend nato allies that are attacked only if they had `` fulfilled their obligations to us . '', 
    though he said he disagreed with those remarks , mcconnell ( r-ky . ) said the nato comments did n't give him concern about trump 's fitness to be commander-in-chief . 
    `` i think he 's wrong on that , '' mcconnell said . 
  `` i do n't think that view would be prevalent or held by anybody he might make secretary of state or secretary of defense . '', 
    trump 's nato policy aside , mcconnell showed little consternation about the controversial real-estate mogul 's controversy-filled convention week . 
  technically , though , the president normally almost-completely owns foreign affairs . 
  i do n't think that there 's been a showdown where congress tried to force the president to act ; normally , it 's the opposite . 
   his vice president also claimed cigarettes did n't cause cancer he said that there 's no * proof * that they caused cancer . 
  not quite the same thing . 
   ~ ~ is ~ ~ was finland, 
  took 70 years and a lot of lives to build that reputation that he 's acting pretty free with . 
  the 2 % commitment is a legit issue , but that ai n't how to go about it . 
  bolton 's a huge critic of the un and maybe the world 's least-diplomatic diplomat . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voinbs8eodk i mean , i guess i 'd prefer him to gingrich , but ... 
  yeah , he 's not really the guy i 'd want as secstate . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newt_gingrich  on july 21 , 2016 , gingrich argued that members of nato `` ought to worry '' about a u.s. commitment to their defense . 
  he expanded , saying , `` they ought to worry about commitment under any circumstances . 
  every president has been saying that the nato countries do not pay their fair share '' . 
  he also stated that , in the context of whether the united states would provide aid to estonia ( a nato member ) in the event of a russian invasion , he `` would think about it a great deal '' . 
   would n't be only bad , would be one of the worst things he could do . 
  i bet that there are much worse things !, 
  well , it 's easy to compliment the brits !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_of_the_united_kingdom  british literature , music , cinema , art , theatre , comedy , media , television , philosophy , architecture and education are important aspects of british culture . 
  the united kingdom is also prominent in science and technology , producing world-leading scientists ( e.g. 
  isaac newton and charles darwin ) and inventions . 
  sport is an important part of british culture ; numerous sports originated in the country , including football . 
  the uk has been described as a `` cultural superpower '' , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and london has been described as a world cultural capital . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   the industrial revolution , which started in the uk , had a profound effect on the socio-economic and cultural conditions of the world . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/music_of_the_united_kingdom  throughout its history , the united kingdom has been a major exporter and source of musical innovation , drawing its cultural basis from the history of the united kingdom , from church music , western culture and the ancient and traditional folk music and instrumentation of england , scotland , northern ireland and wales ... this led to the explosion of the [ british invasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_invasion ) , while subsequent notable movements in british music include the new wave of british heavy metal and britpop . 
  the united kingdom has one of the world 's largest music industries today , with many british musicians having influenced modern music . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_united_kingdom  in the 18th century the uk was the first country to industrialise , [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] and during the 19th century it had a dominant role in the global economy , [ 38 ] accounting for 9.1 % of the world 's gdp in 1870 . 
  [ 39 ] from the late 19th century the second industrial revolution was also taking place rapidly in the united states and the german empire ; this presented an increasing economic challenge for the uk . 
  the costs of fighting world war i and world war ii further weakened the uk 's relative position . 
  in the 21st century , however , it remains a great power and has an influential role in the world economy . 
  [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] i 'd go look for a list of top things that the uk has done , but [ even in doing that , i 'd just be referring to you guys ] ( http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/ ) , because [ even your pub arguments turn out some pretty good stuff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guinness_world_records#history ) . 
  thanks for the [ web ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tim_berners-lee ) and [ the programmable computer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_babbage ) and [ computer science ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alan_turing ) and the english language , so that we can even be having this conversation !, 
  well , another part of that was that mexico was going to pay for it . 
  i 'm not sure how that 's gon na work , unless mexico gets reimbursed in some way . 
  i bet that there 's nothing that french nationalists love more than american political activists involving themselves in french elections . 
  having similar fears in both countries does n't mean that one country 's outcome is dependent upon the other . 
  well , i 've no objection to that ( i think that nato is advantageous to both the eu and the us and other members ) , regardless of what the eu does militarily . 
  while i do n't think that trump is actually going to run off ( and over the next three months , he 's going to have to align what he 's casually said on the campaign trail with what bureaucrats are actually going to do ) , i also ca n't prove it , and it * is * the case that one day someone might very much want to do just that .
