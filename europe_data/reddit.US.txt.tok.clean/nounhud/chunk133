  i do n't agree with the rooskie crowd running around here panicking over hillary , but in legal terms , it 's hard for congress to block the president from kicking off a conflict if they really wanted to . 
  and unlike a parliamentary system , there 's no vote of no confidence . 
  barring impeachment , once you 're in the driver 's seat , you 're in for the duration . 
  this is the largest restriction : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_powers_resolution  the war powers resolution requires the president notify congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and forbids armed forces from remaining for more than 60 days , with a further 30-day withdrawal period , without a congressional authorization for use of military force ( aumf ) or a declaration of war by the united states . 
  after softball primaries , too . 
  a vote for trump is a vote for eu federalization !,

  [ there 's also a us mission to every eu member .

  [ chelsea clinton/ivanka trump 2020 ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/chelsea-clinton-ivanka-trump-friends-227950 ) , i guess . 
  originally , we [ used to have the second-place winner be vp ] ( http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/when-did-vice-presidency-stop-going-to-second-place-ask-smithsonian-180957199/?no-ist ) . 
  that sort of thing encouraged gridlock ( and kinda creates bad assassination incentives ) . 
  they 're not really independent ... 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural-born-citizen_clause  some presidential candidates were not born in a u.s. state or lacked two u.s.-citizen parents . 
  [ 93 ] in addition , one u.s. vice president ( al gore ) was born in washington , d.c. , and another ( charles curtis ) was born in the kansas territory . 
  this does not necessarily mean that these officeholders or candidates were ineligible , only that there was some controversy about their eligibility , which may have been resolved in favor of eligibility . 
  [ 94 ] [ snip ]  barry goldwater was born in phoenix , in what was then the incorporated arizona territory of the united states . 
  during his presidential campaign in 1964 , there was a minor controversy over goldwater 's having been born in arizona three years before it became a state . 
  [ 95 ] [ snip ]  a clarification to this interpretation was made in 2010 , where a three-judge panel of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit held that natural born citizens can lose their citizenship if their territory of birth later ceases to be u.s. territory . 
  if we annex land , i think that that makes it okay . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elizabeth_ii  born : 21 april 1926 ( age 90 )   17 bruton street , mayfair , london , uk i think that we 'd have to establish the state of bruton street for the queen to be president , barring constitutional amendment . 
  canada ( temporarily ) did something like this for the netherlands when the netherlands was occupied during world war ii : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/princess_margriet_of_the_netherlands  the princess was born in ottawa civic hospital , [ 2 ] ottawa , ontario , as the family had been living in canada since june 1940 after the occupation of the netherlands by nazi germany . 
  the maternity ward of ottawa civic hospital in which princess margriet was born was temporarily declared to be extraterritorial by the canadian government . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] making the maternity ward outside of the canadian domain caused it to be unaffiliated with any jurisdiction and technically international territory . 
  this was done to ensure that the newborn would derive her citizenship from her mother only , thus making her solely dutch , which could be very important in the case that the child would have been a male , and as such , the heir of princess juliana . 
  there 's nothing saying how long they have to take . 
  i wonder how long we could go without a president . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_netherland  the claimed territories extended from the delmarva peninsula to extreme southwestern cape cod , while the more limited settled areas are now part of the mid-atlantic states of new york , new jersey , delaware , and connecticut , with small outposts in pennsylvania and rhode island . 
  probably not , but i think that land values in that region have gone up a bit since 1614 . 
  may be a bit pricey . 
  ** except for washington dc and puerto rico , because they suck and are n't cool enough for federal representation !, 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_ambassador_to_the_european_union ) we 've had an ambassador to the eu since 1961 . 
   the formal title of this position is representative of the united states of america to the european union , with the rank and status of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary . 
  edit : looks like mostly career diplomats rather than political appointees , so i assume that it 's a `` real '' position . 
  i mean , i was sick of it months ago , but this is election day . 
  i can live with one day . 
  online forums easily beat the major media outlets for people predicting national doom after the election outcome . 
  look at soviet military hats . 
  if people want it after the fact , there are gon na be about a million people hawking knock-offs . 
  i 'd give reasonable odds on whoever gets elected being a one-term president . 
  he does what he can , but the almighty 's got his limits . 
  [ judges 1:19 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=judges+1:19&amp;version=niv )  the lord was with the men of judah .

  yeah , well , that 's normal . 
  in a surprise election-day turnaround , / r/europe decides [ to endorse trump ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-nigel-farage-job-campaign-eu-ambassador-presidential-administration-a7404136.html ) ? 
   mr farage , who remains leader of ukip 's group of meps despite stepping down as party chief after the eu referendum , said he would like to serve as mr trump 's ambassador to the european union . 
  i 'm not ... actually sure that farage can be simultaneously a mep for the uk * and * the us ambassador to the eu without some sort of a conflict of interest ... though i suppose he 'd be basically shit-slinging the same way in both positions anyway . 
  to be fair , i believe that the vw thing was because the disparity between regulatory limits and actual performance was so massive that a software update either would have not been viable or would have absolutely rendered the vehicle impractical , which meant scrapping the things . 
  if audi is close to the limits , can probably just be patched in software . 
  unless it 's actually depriving a lot of vehicle owners of their vehicles , i do n't think that the owners suffer any sort of truly severe harm . 
  edit : i should add that the other week , i asked a buddy who hacks on engine control software as a hobby what he thought of the whole affair , since he 's more into this sort of thing , and he had a couple of points : * it was n't just vw cheating , trying to come up with behavior that triggered on emissions tests but not for a more-typical use case , but vw was way out there in terms of egregiousness and degree . 
  * the critical factor causing some of the issue is n't us standards , but california standards . 
  california had extremely bad air pollution issues in los angeles in the 1970s and 1980s , and successfully cleaned them up by creating the california air resources board ( the guys who just found the issue here ) , requiring emissions checks , and limiting what new cars could emit ... but that institution kept tightening emissions limits after that as time went on , to an extremely-restrictive degree . 
  he gave some examples of how extremely-limiting they were and suggested that the current level of regulated emissions is probably really unnecessary and it 'd probably make sense to lower the existing california standards and permit more emissions . 
  < chuckles  actually , given that i believe that propaganda piece was originally to encourage people in the us to buy war bonds for world war i , to effectively donate to fighting world war i , technically kinda was . 
  libya is not a `` us war '' any more than iraq was a `` british war '' . 
  we agreed to come because france asked us to do so . 
  we 'd probably do it again if they got in a fight . 
  however , libya also is n't where the bulk of people are coming from . 
  the strong majority are coming via turkey . 
   for example , you do n't have to play two musical instruments and have goethe-institut level of language mastery to become a professor in us university . 
  you need good credentials in your area of expertise and english decent enough to communicate ( hinglish or chinglish will usually do ) . 
  do you in europe ? 
   except these people are likely genuine refugees in australia ? 
  possible , though the very great falloff associated with the pacific solution being in force makes me skeptical .
