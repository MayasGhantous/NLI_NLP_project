  possibly if everyone was just heading over to new zealand or similar as a second-best choice . 
   no policy is worth giving refugees just those two choices . 
  well , that 's a value decision . 
  i respect your right to take that position , but it 's not one that i hold , and i think many people also do not hold that position . 
  further , i 'm skeptical of value statements that deal with absolutes ( `` no policy that might permit for loss of a human life is acceptable '' , etc. ), 
  in this case , we 're talking about latvia and germany . 
  i believe that the two countries could , in theory , establish an agreement where latvia would accept people and process them . 
  i agree that it would not be popular at all in latvia ( and i am not very enthusiastic about redistribution proposals on practical political grounds ) , but the same is true of processing and then moving people to that country , and the eu is still aiming for that . 
  well , i would n't say `` imprisoning '' in that they could leave to the home country other than the general sense that children ca n't just go wherever they want for practical reasons . 
  but i do agree that there are certainly costs associating with being able to establish that dissuasive factor . 
  the public and policymakers would need to decide whether that tradeoff is worthwhile . 
  hmm . 
  i think that you actually can , as long as both countries are willing to do so ( which is what all these `` quotas '' and `` assignments '' are based on , after all -- intra-eu agreements ) . 
  ca n't think of anything that would actually prevent it . 
  the refugee convention certainly voids the requirements on signatories to extend refugee perks to someone extended refugee status once another country accepts them , but it does n't grant special powers to transport people anywhere -- that 'd be something already present . 
  not saying that 's not a factor , but [ this shows an awfully strong correlation with the pacific solution being activated and deactivated ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/boatarrivals.gif ) ( sourced from [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) ) and really suggests that the presence or absence of the pacific solution is the dominant factor . 
   they 're not refugees in the first place . 
  as i point out [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5bngqj/eu_chief_refugees_refusing_asylum_destinations/d9qo4r5/ ) , that 's not necessarily the case . 
  being a refugee does n't mean that you do n't have economic * preferences * -- that 's independent of whether-or-not you 're a refugee . 
  they might not be refugees , but you ca n't conclude that simply because they think that they can get into germany/sweden/what-have-you by refusing another location . 
  i do n't see why not . 
  you could send them there and then process them there . 
   the pacific solution is not relatively strict , there is no stricter policy that i have witnessed around the world . 
  well , it 's more-lenient than simply refusing to take asylum applicants in at all , for example . 
  as per-capita gdp rises , i would also expect the ppp index to align . 
  no cheaper labor means that it 's more expensive to get services and the like . 
  i do n't think that it matters * that * much whether you 're using ppp or nominal for this . 
  hmm . 
  so the issue would be one of time ? 
  that is , you feel that the justification would n't exist if people were swiftly whisked off to latvia ? 
   so what is your solution ? 
  i 'm not trying to push people towards a `` just give up '' approach to immigration control . 
  i personally think that the pacific solution , which is relatively-strict , is probably the best approach i 've seen thus far . 
  but that does n't mean that i do n't want to look for errors on either side of the debate . 
  i 've seen many people making the `` migrants care about economics , so they are n't real refugees '' argument , and that just does n't hold up in my eyes . 
  not the russian armata , but the chinese [ type 63a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_63a ) light tank is amphibious and can , according to wikipedia , apparently do 120km at sea . 
  also : http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-ultimate-weapon-war-floating-tanks-15100  the nazis planned to ride in submersible tanks during an invasion of the united kingdom . 
  unlike other types , these vehicles would drive along the english channel 's seabed at depths of nearly fifty feet deep using a snorkel to keep water out of the engine . 
  they would then crawl out of the water and up the beaches toward their objectives . 
  finally , you 've got hovercraft and similar vehicles to land tanks . 
  honestly , there 's nothing really new here , other than speculation about what the queen wants . 
  this is all material that people have gone over before in detail . 
  that 's running into the same issue that i raised above . 
   your refugee legitimacy is independent of whether-or-not you want to move somewhere to make more money . 
    i 'd imagine that both refugees and non-refugees would want that . 
  it 's not a valid conclusion to draw that people do n't have a valid refugee claim * even if * given this opportunity to claim asylum , they plan to go to the wealthiest place possible . 
  sounds good !,

  2015 : http://time.com/3847569/cinco-de-mayo-astronauts-space-tacos/ 2016 : http://mashable.com/2016/04/16/space-taco-nasa/ the state of space tacos is constantly improving . 
   from the australian perspective , my feeling is if you were a genuine refugee , fleeing from iran , afghanistan , sri lanka etc , then you would be happy when you get to the first safe country !, 
  i disagree . 
  you could easily be a refugee , but * also * want badly to make more money . 
  your refugee legitimacy is independent of whether-or-not you want to move somewhere to make more money . 
  i 'd imagine that both refugees and non-refugees would want that . 
  what * would * be an argument against refugee status is if someone offered a safe location , but with no great improvement in income potential or path to citizenship in a nicer location , and someone turned that down * without having to give up a nicer slot elsewhere * . 
  then , they 've said that they do n't much care about safety . 
  i do n't quite get what you 're getting at . 
  you mean that if someone gets asylum in latvia , that they 'd only stay there long enough to get citizenship , and then go to germany , and that this would pull up their roots , so it 's best to just go directly to germany ? 
  realistically , that was going to happen , and i think that it 's probably a worthwhile tradeoff . 
  beggars will go where people are well-to-do and the traffic is high . 
  but that 's intra-eu migration , rather than an issue of asylum . 
   what are you even talking about ? 
  the un would seriously mean shit in such a case . 
  germany/france/the uk/whoever is n't going to say : oh no , we have no un mandate to defend our neighbor against russia . 
  seems like we are bound to sit here and do nothing . 
  i think he 's talking about if all countries in the eu adopted an austria-style individual neutrality guarantee and abandoned collective security efforts like nato or the eu 's mutual aid clause . 
  the un charter explicitly permits regional security agreements : http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-viii/  nothing in the present charter precludes the existence of regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with such matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action provided that such arrangements or agencies and their activities are consistent with the purposes and principles of the united nations . 
  yes -- i 'm not disputing your point that there were serious implications for nuclear non-proliferation . 
  it 's just that you said that the us and the uk did not act , and i had the impression that you were saying that the two were also not following the agreement . 
  yes , i agree that russia violated the agreement . 
  my point is that the us and the uk did not do so . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances  according to the memorandum , russia , the u.s. , and the uk confirmed , in recognition of belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine becoming parties to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and in effect abandoning its nuclear arsenal to russia , that they would :   * respect belarusian , kazakh and ukrainian independence and sovereignty and the existing borders . 
  [ 13 ]   * refrain from the threat or use of force against belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine . 
    * refrain from using economic pressure on belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine in order to influence its politics . 
    * seek immediate united nations security council action to provide assistance to belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine , `` if belarus/kazakhstan/ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used '' . 
    * refrain from the use of nuclear arms against belarus , kazakhstan and ukraine . 
    * consult with one another if questions arise regarding these commitments . 
  [ 14 ] [ 15 ] the united states and the united kingdom fulfilled those obligations . 
  additionally , the united states and the united kingdom , as part of the european union , imposed sanctions on russia whose lifting is conditional on russian withdrawal from crimea . 
  frankly , the president ( and , in general , leaders of countries ) get far more credit and blame than they deserve for the shifts in a country 's economic activity . 
  they have a relatively-limited impact . 
   but , even though the moves they take on the geo-political chessboard are inacceptable , they are still understandable from a wider perspective . 
  take the invasion of crimea for example . 
  this act was a reaction to the recent association agreement between the ukrain and the eu . 
  it was primarily about trade , though there was also a military part , which called for more military exercises with each other . 
  the media should have called them out for that and warned the public that this would tear the country appart , ** because it was going to force russia to secure geo-strategically important areas : crimea ** . 
  from that point of view it seems quite reasonable for russia to do so , of course , only if you just focus on the strategical sand box these politicians find themselves in . 
  if you recall the winter war , stalin 's justification for first demanding pieces of ( as well as destruction of fortifications that would prevent further invasion ) and then invading finland was that it required parts of finland to increase defense of the soviet union . 
   one week after the nazi-soviet pact was signed , hitler invaded poland . 
  on september 17 , russia attacked poland from the east , absorbing enough territory to give stalin a `` buffer zone '' on that part of the ussr 's frontier . 
  the foreign minister of estonia was invited to moscow on september 22 , and only one week later an agreement was signed that gave moscow the right to station troops , aircraft , and naval units in that small baltic nation -- in effect , to annex estonia as a satellite . 
  the foreign ministers of latvia and lithuania were invited to moscow during the first week of october , and on the fifth and eleventh of that week , they too signed `` mutual assistance '' treaties with the ussr that would lead to their absorption into stalin 's empire . 
    another and similar summons went out on october 5 , to the finnish government in helsinki . 
  in form it was an invitation ; in substance , it was a demand : a finnish delegation should come to moscow to discuss `` concrete political questions . '', 
  in the words of finnish historian max jakobsen : `` for eighteen months , finland had conducted a muted dialogue with her great neighbor ; the russians had from time to time softly asked a favor or two , and the finns had politely whispered their refusal . 
  now the tone was changed : this time , there had been steel in molotov 's voice . '', 
    at the first high-level meeting in moscow , on october 12 , stalin wasted no time putting his demands on the table . 
  his main strategic problem , he said , was the vulnerability of the frontiers around leningrad . 
  in order to improve the city 's security , he needed -- indeed , he * must * have -- the strongest possible assurances of continued good relations with finland . 
  given the chaos that had recently engulfed europe , he had serious fears about the possibility of an attack against that sensitive part of the soviet union , either from the gulf of finland or from the finnish mainland .
