    the soviet union therefore demanded :   * that the frontier between russia and finland in the karelian isthmus region be moved westward to a point only 20 miles east of viipuri , and that all existing fortifications on the karelian isthmus be destroyed ;   * that the finns cede to russia the islands of suursaari , lavansaari , tytarsaari , and koivisto in the gulf of finland , along with most of the rybachi peninsula on the arctic coast . 
  in compensation for this , stalin was willing to exchange 5,500 square kilometers of east karelia , above lake ladoga ;   * that the finns lease to the ussr the peninsula of hanko , and permit the russians to establish a base there , manned by 5,000 troops and some support units . 
    in practical terms , such concessions would mean the abandonment of finland 's main defense , the mannerheim line , leaving the country gravely weakened . 
  moreover , it was the opinion of nearly everyone in the finnish government that these demands , as stunning as they were , were only the prelude to other , more severe demands -- demands that the finns would be powerless to reject because they would have already lost their strongest line of defense . 
  [ footnote 1 ] this is n't the first time that russia 's invaded and annexed land in europe with a justification of requiring more land to defend russia . 
  let 's take what i 'd call a rather generous interpretation and say that these are n't just words to cover up desired annexations . 
  if she ca n't feel secure without having access to additional land that belongs to her neighbors , then one would ask a few questions : * russia 's got more land in the world than any other country . 
  if there are strategically-critical things in russia , how about using other of that land to deal with them ? 
  russia 's got more land on the black sea . 
  the port of novorossiysk is n't nicely built-up for a fleet the way sevastopol is , true , but it could be . 
  i understand that russia is presently expanding her military facilities there and housing more submarines there . 
  * why is it that other european countries do n't suffer this fate and feel the need to be slicing off bits of their neighbors ? 
  * the internationally-agreed-upon requirement is that one not annex land beyond one 's borders . 
  if russia , which has agreed to this , does n't actually use this standard -- if it retains some sort of unwritten claims on plum parts of ukraine , one might ask where the * real * line is , and how easily it might shift . 
  i can assert that i require nearly any of a neighbor 's land for defensive purposes . 
  that 's not a standard which i think countries can reasonably support . 
  * in a hypothetical world where borders were n't what matters , i severely doubt that russia would be willing to commit these new rules to paper and live by them herself . 
  for example , japan used a very similar rationale to open the [ russo-japanese war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-japanese_war ) after russia leased port arthur from china . 
  does russia consider that war legitimate ? 
  should russia have acceded to japanese demands from the get-go ? 
  would russia provide similar territorial concessions to other countries sufficient to let * them * feel safe ? 
  for example , my guess is that the baltics would probably feel more-secure were russia to cede kaliningrad and land around themselves to other european countries . 
  were nato similarly following this `` can demand land if it makes countries feel more secure '' business that you 're asserting , it could most-assuredly demand that russia similarly hand over land to those countries . 
  would you say that russia should similarly accept such demands , and that not doing so would be unreasonable on russia 's part ? 
  my belief is that russia would never willingly accept such demands against herself . 
  thus , it seems quite reasonable to me to ask why ukraine should be expected to do the same . 
  * there is always an option to achieve ownership of land -- to extend an offer to buy it on terms that the other party also finds agreeable . 
  there has never been a restriction on russia buying crimea from ukraine . 
  now , as a rather nice piece of real estate that 's developed , it would probably be quite expensive , but it remains an option . 
  if russia * really badly * wants crimea for reasons that are critical to russia , one might ask why she has n't offered ukraine a deal to purchase it , rather than simply seizing it .

  i 'm kinda surprised that the bbc 's go-to height reference is the empire state building . 
  i mean , it 's meaningful to new yorkers , but ... 
  no , i mean ... i think that it needs to be matrilineal all the way . 
  i 'm not a linguist , so if you 're asking for a technical classification , i 'm probably not in a position to give a good answer . 
  it 's more than a list of words , though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klingon_grammar  it is a nominative -- accusative , primarily suffixing agglutinative language , and has an object -- verb -- subject word order . 
  the klingon language has a number of unusual grammatical features , as it was designed to sound and seem alien , but it has an extremely regular morphology . 
   i 'm really impressed that they keep track of ancestry for statistics . 
  they do n't . 
  that census data is entirely self-reported -- it 's what you consider yourself to be . 
   what is exactly the purpose ? 
  < shrug  whatever statistical/data analysis projects someone needs . 
  if you provide data , somewhere data scientists will be doing something useful with it . 
  you mean how much money they make on an ethnic group basis ? 
  i guess [ somewhat above average ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_united_states_by_household_income#by_ancestry ) . 
  not as much as latvian-americans , but a lot more than african-americans . 
   for the british it mostly has to do with the civil war . 
  you know , on the civil war . . i 'm not gon na say that the brits are angels or that they had selfless motives , and i realize that it was a bloody , nasty affair . 
  but ... churchill really did try to do quite a bit to keep greece and poland away from the soviet union ( pushing rather harder than roosevelt did on poland , one might add ) . 
  he did n't have the clout to manage poland , but did manage greece . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/percentages_agreement  winston churchill ( not stalin ) proposed the agreement , under which the uk and ussr agreed to divide europe into spheres of influence , with one country having `` predominance '' in one sphere , and the other country would have `` predominance '' in another sphere . 
  [ 3 ] [ snip ]  stalin did keep to his promise about greece , but did not keep his promise for romania , bulgaria , and hungary , which became one-party communist states with no british influence . 
  yugoslavia became a non-aligned communist state with very limited soviet or british influence . 
  britain supported the greek government forces in the civil war but the soviet union did not assist the communist guerrillas . 
  [ 10 ] and i 've seen bitter complaints on here that the uk did n't act to halt the communist takeover in poland , but also seen complaints that uk * did * act in greece . 
  i 'm not gon na say that their actions were ideal , but it seems to me that the brits are kinda getting the short end of the stick in picking up blame from both directions . 
  my point is that it seems difficult to claim opposition to capital punishment as a * western * value because of this . 
  one might claim it as a french value or perhaps a european value , but it seems difficult to describe it as a * western * value . 
  ( setting aside the question of whether there 's a basis for presuming some arrow of progress along which the united states will move . ), 
  how come ? 
  is this from the us and british support for the right-wing governments in greece up until the mid-1970s ? 
  only if you successfully get asylum status after the illegal entry ( the refugee convention requires that countries ignore illegal entry if the person has a legitimate asylum claim and came directly to the country in question ) . 
  afaik , the same is true for european countries ( more or less , the year count may vary a bit ) . 
  germany is five years as well . 
   the 2000 us census showed 1,153,295 greeks living in the us . 
  about 3 million americans are of greek ancestry . 
  no , i 'm trying to understand what you 're getting at in saying that he guy has corruption issues . 
  normally , if i walked in a door and said `` someone just tried to kill bob '' and someone says `` bob was corrupt '' in response , i 'd kinda think that it 's a justification . 
  that being said , war in the past also was n't typically something that we * had * the ability to conduct as dispassionately , and in as controlled and targeted a way as we do now . 
  the intelligence-gathering , the dropping a bomb on a specific group of people ... that 's arguably something that is moving closer to a police action than a military one . 
  let 's say that hypothetically , you could gas the area with knockout gas and have robots retrieve them or something like that ... if you * could * do that , * should * the onus be on us to do that ? 
  unless the us is n't in the west , capital punishment is n't incompatible with that . 
  well , if they surrender , that 's almost-certainly possible ... but replacing military operations with policing things is n't really a generally-held `` western free value '' , i 'd say . 
  hmm . 
  reading your answer , i guess that the answer is that it 's not that the objection is one of cultural consumption or not , but that they hope for more out of the investment than merely cultural consumption -- the error was on my part to assume that that was the criteria for the exception . 
  fair enough . 
  there was a non-binding referendum .

  i 'd like to add that of the people on here , most speak english extremely well . 
  i 'm sure that i 'm missing some things ( maybe lack of idioms ? ), 
  but ... vocabulary in particular is really remarkably good , and i see a surprisingly-high chunk of people doing things like using hyphenation . 
  it compares favorably to a forum in the us ... though perhaps folks here are unusually well-educated or in some other way not representative .
