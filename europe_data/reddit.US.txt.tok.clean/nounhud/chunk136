  this is n't something that 's normally put in a dictionary , but does matter . 
  now i 'd like to see * other * countries do it ( if not english-speaking , with the word that the english word normally translates to ) and : * look for major differences , to look for any potential * faux pas * someone might make in another country , and list those . 
  * count the number of inversions between the orderings to measure how similar cultures are in their profanity . 
  i 'd also add that i think that there are certain cases where one may be more-acceptable in some cultures than others , but that 's harder to quantify ( the anecdote i had was a romanian-american calling food that he and other people were eating `` shitty '' , which took me a bit aback , due to the mental imagery it evokes ) . 
  well , one of only two . 
   just reply to one comment , no need to spam the thread there were multiple relevant comments . 
   just because the government banned reporting it does n't mean there are n't boat arrivals okay , so you claimed this did n't work earlier . 
  for that to be true , the numbers would need to have not decreased . 
  i have n't seen anything on on unreported arrivals , but , hey , i suppose that `` the graph does n't capture everything '' might be a valid concern . 
  just to be clear , are you claiming that there was not the shown decrease ? 
  can you link to your source for unreported arrival data that you 're using to come to this conclusion ? 
   just because we pay several times what they could earn in welfare over a lifetime to `` settle '' them overseas that 's not a criticism of the program . 
  the idea is to * deter * arrivals , not to take everyone that would have come without the pacific solution in place and then simply house them elsewhere . 
   does n't mean germany could do the same . 
  i agree that the eu waited long enough to institute this that it will be more-challenging to implement . 
  it 's easier to nip in the bud . 
  however , i also think that there are several ways of dealing with this . 
  one way is to have a probability of detainment-and-transfer-out-of-the-country that rises as resources permit . 
  second is to start applying only with new arrivals . 
  a third possible route would be to suspend the naturalization legal residency timer for asylum claims related to the the current crisis -- this is not a violation of the refugee convention . 
  godwin 's law does n't say that someone * ca n't * reference hitler . 
  it just says that the probability of referencing him rises as a discussion thread grows : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin%27s_law  godwin 's law ( or godwin 's rule of nazi analogies ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] is an internet adage asserting that `` as an online discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving nazism or hitler approaches 1 '' [ 2 ] [ 3 ] -- that is , if an online discussion ( regardless of topic or scope ) goes on long enough , sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to hitler or nazism . 
  the point is that it blocks people from starting the legal residency clock towards citizenship , which is why people are coming . 
  take that carrot away , and people stop coming . 
  it 's actually highly-correlated with an almost-complete elimination of new arrivals . 
  fortunately , you did n't have the policy until 2001 , ran it until 2007 , then took it off ( interning people on australian soil ) until later putting it back on , so we 've got data to examine : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution#/media/file%3aboatarrivals.gif notice how you 've got your initial problem , which vanishes as long as the pacific solution is in place , since it blocks people from starting the five year clock towards australian citizenship . 
  the problem exists as long as you leave open a route to citizenship . 
  they 've done political iamas before , [ including with obama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/ ) ( which , i might add , was far more bland and managed than [ the one with j\u00f3n gnarr , the mayor of reykjav\u00edk ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/14obcf/i_am_j%c3%b3n_gnarr_mayor_of_reykjav%c3%adk_ama/ ) ) . 
  probably other political iamas in there too , but i do n't subscribe to that sub . 
  they 're familiar with the challenges and how to address them . 
  that 's certainly an evocative concept . 
  looking at the logos , i think that the [ united federation of planets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_united_federation_of_planets.svg ) was intended to evoke the [ united nations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_the_united_nations.svg ) rather than [ nato ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/seal_of_the_north_atlantic_treaty_organization.png ) , though . 
   the rest of north america on the other hand , they struggle with just the one . 
  hey , now . 
  i bet that we have [ better klingon fluency ] ( http://business.financialpost.com/legal-post/u-s-judge-asked-to-recognize-klingon-as-real-language ) [ than europe does ] ( https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/in-a-lawsuit-over-copyright-in-klingon-here-come-the-klingon-speakers ) . 
   i do appreciate latin as a unifying language . 
  ... ` course , the germanic barbarians up north feel excluded then ... 
  hmm . 
  i guess i do n't understand what you 're getting at . 
  you mean that he deserved to die ? 
  you lost the last one you had and now you want another ? 
  ca n't move the uk with present technology , but ... i wonder how viable it would be to manufacture a new island in the mid-atlantic . 
  there [ is a plate boundary between the african and north american tectonic plates there ] ( http://geology.com/plate-tectonics.jpg ) . 
  islands come from [ undersea volcanos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/submarine_volcano ) , like [ surgery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surtsey ) . 
  while i do n't know of any serious attempts to induce volcanic activity , as i understand it , cracking the crust to let enough water contact magma might be sufficient . 
  we 've done [ peaceful nuclear explosions before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peaceful_nuclear_explosion ) , including some small underground detonations . 
  [ * storax sedan * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sedan_\\ ( nuclear_test \\ ) ) used 100kt to go down 100m . 
  assuming that the same yield is possible , that this works underwater , that this can be done repeatedly , and that a vent 0.4 km in diameter is sufficient to produce a uk-sized island ... 
  it looks like the crust is [ relatively-thin in the mid-atlantic ] ( https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/crust/ ) , somewhere less than 10km . 
  so you 're talking about fewer than a hundred of these things . 
  the largest detonation set off was a [ fifty megaton one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsar_bombay ) . 
  that was five times as powerful as the total yield of all of these . 
  your grandmother 's side , too ? 
  [ john ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_titor ) , will turkey be a democracy twenty years from now ? 
  trump a dictator ? 
  i doubt it . 
   well , usa is pretty fucked because of religion as well . 
  foreign aid to ease our suffering welcome !, 
  what 's their beef with renzi ? 
  [ the reference ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=xsvqlhghlpw ), 
   such claims have n't even been made by the most fucked up propaganda outlets in russia nor their proxy republics in ukraine . 
  i guess that there 's [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_tights ) . 
  perhaps the canadian auxiliary . 
  i 'm trying to figure out how a laptop is a culture-consuming device but a smartphone is n't . 
  not that i think that esperanto is gon na take off in a big way given that it has n't thus far , but what alternative synthetic language do you have that is preferable ? 
  and why is that bias so negative , anyway ? 
  klingon does n't have that bias , but i think that we can both agree that this does n't make klingon more-suitable for use in the eu . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberland ), 
  i do n't think that military resupply is actually protected by international law . 
  there 's the [ iasta treaty 's first freedom of the air ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedoms_of_the_air ) , but that 's for civilian traffic and russia is n't an iasta signatory anyway , so i do n't believe that it 'd apply . 
  that being said , i do n't really see a point in blocking the air traffic . 
  it would n't accomplish anything other than being annoying . 
  the true finns are in coalition , and they 're euroskeptic . 
  finland seems to be staying . 
  the interstellar stage starts ? 
  i do n't see the point . 
  this just winds up with people holding land as proxies . 
  france has overseas departments in the eu , including on other continents . 
  well ... it might exclude people , but are you sure that nobody would donate under those conditions ? 
  like , maybe they would n't mind contact , but do n't want the legal responsibility ? 
  not since bell bottoms were in style . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_subject  in canada , * commonwealth citizen * replaced the term * british subject * when the citizenship act 1977 replaced the canadian citizenship act 1947 . 
  i do n't get it . 
  you 're claiming that a particular bank can achieve a competitive advantage for itself via having higher capitalization requirements , right ? 
  you are n't talking about an externality , some sort of competitive advantage for other uk businesses , but for the bank itself ? 
  if that 's true , then the bank should as-easily be able to commit to that higher capitalizaton requirement independent of regulators and use that as a selling point . 
  you do n't need the government to be involved for that . 
  what , exactly , does the netherlands gain from blocking the agreement ? 
  i do n't know nato concerns enough to know how much montenegro is a liability or benefit . 
  i 'd assume that from a military standpoint , it 's unlikely to be decisive ... but , then , the point of nato is that many members are stronger together . 
  it does completely seal off the mediterranean coast to any nato enemies , as the article says . 
  that might be significant , as i understand that kaliningrad is indeed militarily-significant . 
  my guess is that while montenegro probably will not be a game-changer in terms of what it brings ... it 's also unlikely to represent a major liability . 
  nato is n't the eu , nor does it need to set the requirements that the eu does for membership , since joining does n't expose one member to the other 's drug/crime/etc issues -- you can be in nato and have domestic issues without hurting nato . 
  the eu needs to maintain those requirements , since if it did n't , adding a member would severely harm other members . 
  okay , i think that there are two issues here . 
  the first is that bp was doing nothing other than what other companies were doing . 
  i was not paying much attention to the case at the time , but i do n't believe that this was the case -- the overall outcome was a ruling of gross negligence . 
  second , the idea that the government provides a company with indemnification because it inspects something is not true ( at least not here , and i would strongly assume not in sweden ) . 
  normally , if you cause harm , you 're liable -- and that goes even if there 's no regulation at all covering the matter .
