  europe used to be all monarchies . 
  that seems to be cynical about erdogan , not turks in general . 
  convicting someone of a crime is one thing . 
  imprisoning representatives because they are associated with a group that conducts violent activities is another . 
  hell , it 's not even a good idea . 
  people fight if they ca n't elect those representatives . 
  i 'd be worried about the alternative to bombings going away . 
  might make sense to make it an eu issue . 
  the energy market , oceans , and political issues at play affect all of the eu . 
  that being said , there 's also an eu bias toward inaction if this will be a veto-based vote . 
   same way bp was blamed for the deepwater horizon oil spill even though they definitely were n't operating there without the consent of government or deviated from standard safety practice on oil riggs . 
  the issue was n't , as understand it , predicated on unlicensed operation . 
   the problem is we do n't have time . 
  hmmm . 
  where does the time constraint come from ? 
  that 's not what a referendum * has * to be like . 
   53 % is n't a close call whether or not that is true , the result was 51.9 % , not 53 % . 
  * it 's not / r/eu * the uk has n't left yet . 
  assuming that it leaves . 
  well , it 'd hardly make sense to fix the rules if everything were moving perfectly smoothly . 
  our first confederation had such major problems that we had to dump it in a decade . 
  the eu 's one of a very few attempts to have many large states working together . 
  seems unrealistic to believe that everything would be perfect from the get-go . 
  someone else pointed out that the referendum vote was not whipped . 
  not the heroes you deserve , but ... 
  `` island '' ? 
  that 's an extraordinary claim . 
  do you have a solid source ? 
  why not fix the rules if they are n't viable ? 
  reagan was an actor ... 
  what you 're thinking about with over-the-top is different than he is , though . 
  like , our flag prevalence really does seem to be a lot higher . 
  that might work better with a black hat , red shirt , and yellow pants . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hoosier  there are many suggestions for the derivation of the word , but none is universally accepted . 
  technically , the insults in this comment are n't made-up words . 
  do n't you mod a subreddit with explicit rules devoted to avoiding thoughtful discussion ? 
  hmm . 
  https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/passage-bill/lords/lrds-consideration-of-amendments/  each house considers the other 's amendments   when a bill has passed through third reading in both houses it is returned to the first house ( where it started ) for any amendments made by the second house to be considered . 
    what is ping pong ? 
    if the commons makes amendments to the bill , the lords must consider them and either agree or disagree to the amendments or make alternative proposals . 
    if the lords disagrees with any commons amendments , or makes alternative proposals , then the bill is sent back to the commons . 
    a bill may go back and forth between each house until both houses reach agreement on the exact wording of the bill -- this is known as ` ping pong ', 
  eh , you got past the saxon-norman thing . 
  somewhere in turkey , an erdogan supporter is saying this to someone else . 
  solve it for the french , he means . 
  i do n't assign everything wilders does to `` the dutch '' . 
  please extend us the same courtesy for irritants that happen to be from the us . 
  can the house of lords amend the bill ? 
   in answer to your question there 's a difference between being proud of your country and believing it 's better than all the others . 
   you do n't want everything to look so dull like here . 
  familiarity breeds contempt . 
  also , honestly , our judiciary has less-elaborate and - regimented get-up , but it [ still is n't * quite * streetwear ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/supreme_court_us_2010.jpg ) . 
  pictures of [ judges in their gear around the world ] ( http://jjmccullough.com/judges.htm ), 
  i mean , we 're discussing this on a website that bills itself as `` the front page of the internet '' . 
  not that i do n't think that reddit is * closer * to that than the * daily mail * is to its title , but they seem to both be pretending to something rather ambitious . 
  * common dreams * , * mother jones * , * jacobin * , * world socialist web site * , and * alternet * all have a left orientation , and i do n't much like any of them . 
  it 's not even that ... if farage were out risking being picked up for criminal mischief or arson or murder or something similar , that 'd be one thing . 
  at least the aroma of hypocrisy would n't be floating around . 
  but he 's just encouraging other people to do so without any exposure to himself . 
   i would rather we follow the will of the people than the will of a corrupt and self-interested establishment . 
  * i do n't think that the british bureaucracy is particularly corrupt . 
  * i do n't think that a preference for remain there is driven by corruption . 
   so what 's the problem here ? 
  well , i think that the article 's point is that russia says that she 's not involved but has contractors there operating in the same role as soldiers would be . 
  it 's not criticizing the use of contractors in general . 
  start 'em early , i guess . 
  wow . 
   this week , i passed the four lovely portland stone pillars near hyde park corner in a taxi . 
  these are memorial gates dedicated to the south asian , african and caribbean soldiers who fought in the two world wars . 
  so ... author starts by talking about walking up to a memorial to same , and then starts describing the history as `` whitewashed '' ? 
  < shrug  how did east germany pay west germany after the wall fell ? 
  that helps , but as per wikipedia , it took 18 minutes for the swat team to get on-scene ( and that was n't because they were just waiting around -- as the [ * 44 minutes * dramatization ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wty8vsi4fs0 ) shows , traffic was a problem ) . 
  a [ national geographic documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44ygyluoqq ) as well . 
  also , in [ this stockton hostage-taking bank robbery ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxb-d25vji8 ) , the robbers kept stopping their stolen suv around corners and firing rifle rounds at the police following them to try to ambush them . 
   [ the gunmen disabled 14 police cars with gunshots , the report stated . 
  ] ( http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-stockton-bank-robbery-20150817-story.html ) after that , the police put a bearcat armored personnel carrier up front and had it shield the following police cars in the chase . 
   back when i was a kid , cops only really ever had pistols and shotguns , but then the north hollywood shootout also , ten years before that , the [ 1986 fbi miami shootout ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_fbi_miami_shootout ) , where federal agents were underarmed . 
  i suspect that spanish media is n't going to broadcast videos of a motorcycle cop in the us writing someone a speeding ticket . 
  a huge standoff , however , is a much-more-likely thing to hit the news . 
  i really wish that you guys would use a new name for two of them . 
  this is going to be a source of pain forever otherwise . 
  how about choosing a relatively-little-used eu language , and using the term for `` council '' in that , making it the proper name elsewhere ? 
  that way , everyone else has a distinct way to refer to it . 
  latvian 's `` padome '' , which is short , sounds great to me and ca n't be confused with `` council '' when spoken , like some of the other terms could . 
  or lithuanian 's `` taryba '' . 
  incorporates other european languages , and makes life easier for everyone . 
  `` reverse racism '' * is n't * real . 
  it 's a ridiculous term , and the proper term is `` racism '' . 
  edit : also , is n't this article written by a canadian about canada and the us , not europe ? 
   militarization of the police because they 've got armored vehicles ? 
  you can have a world in which the police can use armor to stop bullets or a world in which their only defense is to shoot first if they feel at risk . 
  me , i 'm partial to the first world . 
  edit : also , the [ strap on that saddle looks absurdly loose ] ( http://www.western-saddle-guide.com/tie-a-western-cinch.html ) . 
  well ... i expect that you and hawking are fully-aligned on the matter , then . 
  that was hawking 's point -- that someone who does n't specialize in the field , even the person probably most-world-renowned for being intelligent , is n't going to be able to provide a good solution . 
  the synthesizers were built by speech plus , a silicon valley company . 
  the average person ca n't do it with the knowledge that they have off the top of their head . 
  however , given time to consult with experts and other interested parties , they could do so . 
  it is too expensive to do that with everyone , so this `` consult with experts '' approach can not be applied to direct democracy . 
  however , it * is * possible to do that with a limited number of representatives .
