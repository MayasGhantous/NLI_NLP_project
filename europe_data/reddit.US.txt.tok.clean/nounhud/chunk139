  for the word is never absolute truth , but only man 's frail and human effort to approach the truth . 
  to reject the word is to reject the human search .

  [ the us also varies in speech rate by state ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/speaking-fast-and-slow/459393/ ) , with about a 50 % higher words-per-minute in the fastest states than the slowest . 
  i do n't know if this holds in the uk -- i ca n't find pages referencing it -- but when i 've seen documentaries on people from remote islands or small villages in the uk , they seem to speak fairly slowly . 
  here 's [ someone on orkney ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyw4c6sb-1w ) . 
  that 's not even specific to entire languages . 
  there 's lingo too : [ for example , take this quote on english law ] ( http://www.lawteacher.net/lecture-notes/tort-law/limitation-lecture.php ) :  it is trite law that the english limitation acts bar the remedy and not the right , and furthermore , that they do not even have this effect unless and until pleaded . 
  now , every one of those words means something in common english . 
  you can get a very vague idea of what they entail by knowing common english . 
  but this sentence has little meaning to someone who just knows common english and is not familiar with english law , where these have a lot of precise , additional technical meaning attached to their common meaning . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i feel like i know most of the british ones , but that they 're typically more-explicit here . 
  not sure if the brits are more-subtle or if the chart author was playing it up . 
  some more us ones : | what gets said in the us | what they mean | what people think if taking literally | | - | - | - | | good luck with that | you 're never going to manage that ( `` you 'd need a lot of luck with it '' ) | he wishes me the best on this | | i 'm not sure that that 's the best approach | that 's a terrible approach and it 's not going to work | he thinks that there might be some other possibilities | | that 's just great/fantastic/wonderful | that 's awful | that 's very good | | i think i can probably manage | it 'll be easy for me and i do n't need help ( typically said while smiling ) | he is unsure about whether he can manage it and help should be offered or someone else considered for the task | some british ones i 've noted that differ from the us , based on reading / r/ukpolitics and / r/unitedkingdom : * the brits have a different set of [ intensifiers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intensifier ) in common use and some of them differ markedly in strength from the us . 
  `` awesome '' in the us definitely does not mean `` awe-inspiring '' any more -- it 's much weaker , just means `` good '' . 
  i 'm not sure whether us mass media has pushed that over , but i have seen brits using the word in its original sense , which came off as really strange . 
  `` absolutely '' and `` utterly '' in the uk are weaker than in the us and get used a lot more . 
  * `` brilliant '' is not used to mean `` good '' in the us -- it 's much-more-common to see it used to mean `` intelligent '' . 
  it seems to be very common in the former use in the uk . 
  * it seems much more common for people to write out `` slurred '' or `` casual '' forms of words the way they 're pronounced in the us . 
  i do it a lot myself ( `` i dunno '' for `` i do n't know '' , for example ) , but i 've seen it with many other terms : `` dammit '' for `` damn it '' , `` yeah '' , `` ai n't '' ( though this indicates being deliberately folksy ) , etc. 
  when brits do this , it seems to mostly be to indicate that the text is coming from a particular region or social class in the uk , which can be distinguished by their speech . 
  * british writing seems to make more use of understatement than us writing . 
  i guess this one is n't really a surprise . 
  * us writing seems to more-commonly have profanity thrown in . 
  `` that sucks '' is probably less-strong and would be less-inappropriate than i suspect it is in british english -- i have n't seen brits using the phrase casually . 
  this is actually really jarring to me when i 'm reading some text from / r/europe from eastern europeans . 
  certain phrases that seem to be stronger or less-acceptable than they would be in the us sometimes get thrown in ... calling something `` shit '' , for example ... i 've known two romanians who use it in english in places where i often get taken aback for a moment , like calling food that you 're eating `` shit '' , which would verge on the inappropriate -- unwanted mental associations . 
  i imagine that reading us english comes off a bit jolting to brits for similar reasons . 
  there 's been a constant trend over time towards shorter sentences . 
  if you go back and read formal english in , say , the late 1700s , the sentences just keep going . 
  here 's a ( one of the more lengthy ) sentences from george washington 's farewell address , from 1792 :  but as it is easy to foresee that , from different causes and from different quarters , much pains will be taken , many artifices employed to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth ; as this is the point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively ( though often covertly and insidiously ) directed , it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness ; that you should cherish a cordial , habitual , and immovable attachment to it ; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity ; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety ; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned ; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest , or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts . 
  now , the average english-language * written * sentence today is much shorter ... and this was from a * speech * , intended to be spoken . 
  normally , spoken english uses even shorter sentences . 
  that may be due to a lot of shared media in one language . 
  i mean , i 've watched movies containing brits , read books containing brits , and spoken with brits speaking in a language that i understand , so i can pick up the idioms . 
  i do n't speak french , so it 's going to be a lot harder for me to pick up on nuance through the frosted glass of translation . 
  it is worth noting that italian fascists used the term `` totalitarian '' to mean `` all encompassing '' , referring to the corporate structure of a fascist state , rather than an oppressive police state . 
  huh , interesting , thanks . 
  i 've only ever heard the term in its modern sense . 
  they do seem to criticize [ saudi arabia ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/ ) and [ iran ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/iran/report-iran/ ) . 
  you know that this sounds exactly as bitter and petty as people in the eu sparring on the uk over brexit , right ? 
  it would n't be the uk blocking it . 
  the roi wants to keep the possibility of future reunification with ni alive . 
  they 'd be the ones to object . 
  my gurss is that the uk is quite aware of the friction this will cause between the eu and the roi and presumably intends to leverage that . 
  roi could leave the eu , could separate from ni much more strongly than is the case , or could act as a gateway that will likely be a massive headache for the eu in the future . 
  maintaining a customs border -- a commitment all eu members make -- between ni and roi means a hard border , unless you 've got some sort of amazing new technology that can `` scan '' vehicles . 
  i 'd think that the uk would not like 3 and the roi would not like 2 . 
  you 're either asking irish unification enthusiasts to give up their dream or the brits to be somewhat disconnected from part of their country , which would tend to encourage same . 
  ha , really ? 
  i did n't know that . 
  saying that the brits did n't fight in the battle of france is about as fair as saying that the french surrender all the time . 
  he germans beat the french and the brits in their first fight . 
  they beat us the first time we fought , too , at kasserine pass . 
  the german military took some risks and fought well . 
  ... which could either remain private or the details could be publicized in the press and turned into an acrimonious public matter . 
  do you know anyone who installs alexa 's toolbar ? 
  i 'm assuming that this is not the british * express * . 
   the energy source with the lowest marginal cost -- almost always renewables -- is usually the first in line to be shut down by power grid operators . 
  i do n't get it . 
  why ? 
  that seems backwards . 
  if you have a power source with high fixed costs and low marginal , i 'd think that you 'd want to keep it active as much as possible , once you 've constructed it . 
  you might want to choose not to build it , but once built , not take it offline . 
  a power source with low fixed and high marginal costs would be ideal for building and then only using as much as is required . 
  i think it 's understood that the politics would have to be sorted out . 
  however , in all other aspects ... 
  yeah , that 's not gon na work . 
  there 's nothing political activists love more than evidence of suppression . 
  they * want * to pick a fight . 
  after they ramp up in response , you gon na imprison some ? 
  because imprisoning amnesty international people is ... these guys live to wage international pr wars against people holding prisoners . 
  there is n't a good exit strategy here . 
  is ukip where the expensive populists live ? 
  you know , i was gon na say `` russia is n't fascist '' , and list wikipedia 's description , but ... it actually does match the summary there to a disturbing degree : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fascism  fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete , and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties . 
  [ 7 ] such a state is led by a strong leader -- such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party -- to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society . 
  [ 7 ] fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature , and views political violence , war , and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation . 
  [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] fascists advocate a mixed economy , with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies . 
  [ 12 ] modern russia is n't * de jure * a one-party state , but it is * de facto * -- nobody realistically expects a competing party to gain control . 
  i would n't call russia totalitarian , but as seen by this article , it 's moving in that direction . 
  russia does n't meet the requirement of explicitly-advocating additional conquest , that i 'm aware of ... though given russia 's relative position , that 'd also be semi-suicidal , and every past few years they 've wound up holding more land and moving toward annexation . 
  autarky has been a stated economic goal at least a few times , though perhaps that 's a natural comeback to the announcement of sanctions . 
  dunno about the degree of interventionism . 
  rejuvenation , strong leader , perceived humiliation ... yeah . 
  that being said , i also think that `` fascism '' is kind of a crummy term , a product of the times , and perhaps a better sort of classification might apply . 
  people use `` fascist '' to wring all the negative connotation they can from it , not normally because they 're interested in a precise classification . 
  checking wikipedia ... sherry can be made in the us freely , and is written lowercase , not as a proper noun , as a place name would be . 
  champagne is grandfathered , but as you said , new us producers can not start and normally use the term `` sparkling wine '' . 
  existing producers must indicate where it is produced as well .
