  i see them saying that india should have independence from the british empire . 
  could you point out where they say that white people have white privilege and need to be punished for same ? 
  i 'm having some difficulty finding it . 
  poland has a higher gdp-per-capita than russia does . 
  not sure that `` things left '' is favorable contest to get into for russia . 
  `` non-military response '' is n't the same as `` accepting '' . 
   he is petty enough to sue a comedian in a court in a foreign country . 
  is it culturally-expected of a turkish politician to fight against attacks on his image , or something that he actually cares about ? 
  at that price range , just get a [ hungarian hand-whittled motorcycle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y-okrifcti ) . 
  are you talking about wooden clogs or just clogs ? 
  because i see [ amazon selling softer clogs ] ( http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3daps&amp;field-keywords=clog ) made from synthetics , and i could see people wearing those . 
  though ... the caption says that this was in helsinki . 
  more than thomas jefferson ? 
   how would you feel like if russia conducted a large scale sea and air exercise 70 km outside of new york ? 
  you will say `` oh let them be its no harm projecting power on our backyard '' ? 
  you [ mean like this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11702328/russian-forces-practised-invasion-of-norway-finland-denmark-and-sweden.html ) ? 
  i do n't think that there was buzzing during that . 
  he 's american . 
  he 's got one overriding concern , which is taking the us out of nato . 
   and the fierce obstructionism he faced i 'm not going to make a statement as to whether obama was a good or bad president , but it 's common for presidential apologists of any administration to blame obstructionism . 
  this is because of the fact that it is rare for both legislative houses and the executive to be controlled by one party -- you can always say that something was due to the * other * guys . 
   does n't the leave campaign always promise closer ties , and a free trade deal with the u.s. , and also the common wealth countries ? 
  [ not since six months ago ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11962277/major-blow-for-brexit-campaign-as-us-rules-out-uk-only-trade-deal.html ) :  major blow for brexit campaign as us rules out uk-only trade deal : us trade representative says america has no interest in a trade deal with britain alone , urging it to remain in the eu, 
  how would that benefit the uk ? 
   referendum campaign it seems increasingly likely to lose https://www.yahoo.com/news/leads-whisker-latest-brexit-poll-yougov-150551248.html  yougov said that the average from its polls in the last six weeks was a two-point lead for `` in '' . 
    online polls have tended to produce results suggesting the race is very tight , while telephone polls have tended to find `` in '' ahead by more comfortable margins . 
  unlikely . 
  the eu does have a mutual defense clause , and if finland , sweden , malta , cyprus , or ireland got into trouble , the other eu members would be responsible for responding , without nato being similarly obligated . 
  well , i imagine that matters at home were seen as a bit more important in the history of the netherlands . 
  i have n't read `` what if '' things on holding the possessions ( the us was mostly simply reacting at this point in the war ) , but i would expect that the militaries involved would not have chosen to fight there if they did not see it as viable to defend them . 
  [ ah , you 'd think that , and it might work in * europe * , but there 's a catch .

  well , here 's the united states navy 's [ analysis of the situation ] ( http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/j/java-sea-campaign.html ) . 
  they did blame the fact that their forces were weaker , but also on the problems created by lack of coordination :  even with the best will on all sides , the practical difficulties of international cooperation are tremendous . 
  that we succeeded as well as we did is a tribute to the men involved . 
  it has been pointed out that we did not achieve a unified command in the strict sense of the word , although we achieved a high degree of cooperation . 
  neither were the various services completely coordinated . 
  it was never possible to plan a combined air and naval operation . 
    the circumstances attending the battle of java sea gave little opportunity for planning and the polyglot character of our striking force made inapplicable the sort of tactical doctrines which would have prevailed had only a single navy been represented . 
  the inadequacy of communications was a formidable handicap , and their breakdown in the midst of the battle condemned us to `` follow-the-leader '' tactics . 
  it seems evident that the information which reached admiral doorman was inadequate ( through no fault of our reconnaissance planes ) or arrived only after so great a delay as to be almost useless . 
  had our planes been able to communicate directly with our striking force our chances of reaching the convoy would have been improved . 
    the careful coordination of japanese surface vessels with planes and submarines in the battle will not escape notice . 
  their effective use of torpedoes will also be remarked . 
  only the * electra * was sunk by gunfire . 
  the * de ruyter * , * java * , * kortenaer * , and probably the * jupiter * were victims of torpedoes fired by either cruisers , destroyers , or submarines . 
  additionally , [ here 's a 2003 master 's thesis on the question ] ( http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a416342.pdf ) . 
  some relevant snippets :  the american , british , dutch , and australian ( abda ) coalition lasted less than two months . 
  from its inception , abda set the stage for its own ultimate failure . 
  the coalition members held different strategies , limited resources , and conflicting interests . 
  the military arm of abda was unable to coordinate even basic operations , preventing a successful offense or defense . 
  from command and control to force integration , it never obtained unity of effort . 
  an analysis of this coalition 's history is relevant today . 
  the basic questions that set the framework for understanding this short-lived coalition are why abda did not work , what could have made it work , and what are future implications for coalition commanders ? 
    the first reason abda did not work was different strategic priorities . 
  while a collective defense , each of the nations held different views on what the priorities should be . 
  for the british , singapore was the center of gravity . 
  the few critical resources in the region , or enroute to the region , were being sent to defend singapore . 
  abda , under british command , pulled resources from its dutch and australian allies to the island fortress . 
  general wavell based his decisions on the defense of singapore , believing that the nei 's and australia 's defenses were tied to the island . 
  the main fallacy of this strategy is to define a geographic point as a center of gravity . 
  [ snip ]  not only was the coalition divided , the services within the coalition members were at odds . 
  macarthur and hart were never able to agree on a unified strategy to employ naval assets . 
  [ snip ]  logistics among the host nations was not interchangeable among its forces . 
  [ snip ]  abda operations and command structure reveal key deficiencies in coalition operations . 
  the deficiencies include poor integration of military forces , no joint doctrine , no coalition training , inadequate command and control ( c2 ) , and little or no intelligence . 
  first , no doctrine existed among the abda forces . 
  each nation operated in accordance with its own military doctrine . 
  the doctrine was of four nations and four services and meant there was never a coordinated position on tactics . 
  second , the allies never conducted joint training , although they were concerned prior to war about the japanese threat and agreed to support one another once conflict began . 
  the inability to train as a force meant that the discovery of deficiencies in their operations could only occur during combat operations . 
    third , the coalition creation and its limitations resulted in an ineffective command structure that maintained national command of component forces but failed to synchronize all of the elements of power . 
  the establishment of geographically separated headquarters only served to lessen abda 's effectiveness of control of forces . 
  the abda forces were unable to achieve effective force integration . 
  the first means to direct and control forces was poor at best . 
  there was no war room or command center , rather each component fought as individual units with little integration . 
  even if the forces had integrated , communications were still inadequate to direct military units . 
  communications went through multiple mediums and sometimes translation took time . 
  the communications were inadequate for forces comprised of multiple nations engaged in battle against an enemy of one nation with excellent command and control . 
    the allied forces never achieved a basic principle of command . 
  they never obtained unity of command . 
  unity of command implies unity of effort among its elements .
