  hmm . 
   in practice , as a landowner , a foreign state could shut down road access or provide accommodation for troops , the agency said in the report . 
  have there been any historical examples of a state purchasing property and then surreptitiously using that property to house a significant chunk of troops pre-surprise-attack and interfere with the movement of defending troops ? 
  i ca n't think of any , not in that sense . 
  maybe buying land and building forts on them , but that 's hardly surreptitious . 
  [ infiltration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infiltration_tactics ) is a thing , but that does n't involve anything this elaborate . 
  accomodations for spies , or something like that , that 's real . 
  but this is talking housing soldiers . 
  there 's [ pre-positioning supplies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_reserve_stock ) to reduce your logistic demands during a military operation . 
  the us stores a ton of military hardware at nato member storehouses so that if there * is * some emergency where it has to drop something and get over there quickly , it is n't having to use up its logistics capacity moving tanks and food and other bulk stuff -- it just has to get the soldiers and critical stuff over . 
  but that 's putting the stuff in friendly places -- there 's no `` risk of discovery '' . 
  the benefit of pre-positioning would be the greatest where the material is bulky , exactly what i 'd imagine would be would be the worst to secretly store somewhere . 
  if country x is trucking in lots of unlicensed tanks to your country , i 'd vaguely-imagine that most countries would start to get curious . 
  i 'd think that there would some significant disadvantages to doing something like that . 
  the target state could throw a monkey wrench into plans by just blocking work . 
  your secretly-housed-soldiers-in-the-country would be subject to arrest at any time . 
  the target country would have an easier time monitoring the thing and figuring out what 's going on . 
  if you want to obstruct defensive movement during an attack by blowing up critical routes or something -- and [ there * is * a history of that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabotage#as_war_tactic ) -- i do n't see why the land ownership would be all that useful . 
  it seems like in most cases it 'd be about-as-viable for a non-land-owner to disrupt movement . 
  i can think of a lot of benign ( or at least militarily-benign ) reasons for russia to buy land in finland and have a hard time finding a plausible explanation associated with a planned attack . 
   in many muslim-majority countries in the world , women 's cycling is a taboo , as it 's considered a threat against a woman 's chastity .

  how about you just ( a ) institute a mandatory paternity test for all children born in your hospitals or at the time they 're given citizenship , provide the results to the father and ( b ) eliminate all your other restrictions on women 's life ? 
  that should address your concerns about your wife popping out some other guy 's kid . 
  it 's way less onerous for the female half of your population than all the cloister-my-woman stuff that 's been around and a pain in the rear for hundreds of years . 
  better living through technology . 
  you can call it `` techno-islam '' . 
  it 'll be great . 
  well ... being a customer who can purchase a lot of a vendor 's product and who has other viable alternatives also available gives the customer leverage . 
  being a customer who has to purchase a vendor 's product means that the vendor has leverage . 
  we had no latin history in the us , and we [ still use latin bits ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_seal_of_the_united_states ) when we want to sound august . 
  european cultural tradition that 's spread around . 
  do n't , ukraine .

  our [ information awareness office ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/information_awareness_office#/media/file:iao-logo.png ) logo never went over very well .

  edit : using an owl for an intelligence agency logo is pretty cool , though . 
  i 'm actually surprised that that 's not more of a thing . 
  i think that it 's just a weird projection . 
  scandinavia is tiny too , and africa is gigantic . 
  what 's more odd is that mexico and everything south of the border has apparently vanished from the picture . 
   and nobody is spending money on repairs/maintance anymore . 
  why ? 
  i mean , i do n't see why that would be connected to radical swings in demand . 
  it 'd be interesting to see whether there 's a corresponding bump in rates of people immigrating with adopted daughters . 
   yet the us has tariffs on chinese steel 16 times bigger than ours [ and they 're working !,

  i bet . 
   i learned most of my english through watching tv shows and movies or play video games in english . 
  in the us , people sometimes do this with japanese for anime ( though translations are a lot more common now ) or video games . 
  i remember how infuriating it was that some stuff was n't translated . 
  i guess it 's hard to appreciate the fact that we 're on the other side of that too . 
  a friend of mine who was taking japanese ( and had watched anime in the past ) went in , and the first day the teacher asked everyone to introduce themselves . 
  they went on through , until they got to him , and the teacher absolutely cracked up . 
  she said `` you speak japanese like a samurai ! '', 
  apparently he was really into medieval-era stuff , and so he 'd learned a lot of the words and conventions from that time , so what came out was something like `` fair maiden , knowst that my name is sir < guy 's name  ! '', 
  in japanese . 
  i hope that the german-speaking soldiers attacking have a bad british/american/french / polish accent , to fully complete the matter . 
   the worst part is that you can actually hear the original voices underneath . 
  in movies , my understanding is that you can normally algorithmically extract voices from background sound because voice is normally recorded in mono and the other audio in stereo ; ` mpv ` uses this technique in its ` karaoke ` filter . 
  you 'd think that you could at * least * be arsed to run something like that , even if whoever purchased the estonian rights could n't get access to the original sound data .

  as evidenced by the `` the us was doing a coup in turkey '' thing , i think that there 's perhaps too much willingness to accuse countries of running coups . 
  there is at best very weak evidence supporting this . 
  and remember betteridge 's law of headlines -- if the headline is a question , the answer is probably no . 
  i 'd also point out that : * this encourages overseas competition . 
  if china can invest in europe , she will invest elsewhere . 
  * this limits the returns for startups . 
  * this limits the returns for people creating technologies if they can not sell them overseas . 
  * it 's probably hard to block investment with the intermediary of a fund or similar . 
  possibly true . 
  that does n't mean that the cap would be popular in the uk , though , even assuming that it is fully understood . 
  not saying that it was the driving factor , but you explicitly listed it as something that should be approved of . 
  but that leads to the response that it would make greece/italy responsible for the issue . 
  honestly , i think that this was a real case where interests conflicted . 
  there was no magic bullet . 
  the real problem was that there was n't a better combined solution found earlier . 
  i favored a pacific solution approach , which probably would not have been politically-viable in germany and would have stretched or violated the refugee convention . 
  nafta is much less politically contentious than it once was , when there used to be strong union opposition early on . 
  `` i do not support ttip in its present form '' . 
  a minor change is made , and it goes through . 
  how would larger members `` annex '' smaller ones ? 
  that has n't happened in any federation that i 'm aware of . 
  i do n't fear quantum mechanics , and i have only a limited understanding of same . 
  i dunno how much the brits would agree on cap being fine . 
  i am opposed to bans on incandescents . 
  that was * not * internalizing an externality , as consumers were already paying more on their electric bills .
