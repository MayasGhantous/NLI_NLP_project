  if you 're worried about consumers not understanding the choices they 're making , you could mandate an estimated lifetime cost on the package . 
  the mercury thermometers were an externality -- the harm caused by waste mercury in landfills was not experienced by consumers . 
  that was a legit ban . 
  you could always do that . 
  will probably be thrown out by a court , but ... 
  not only that , but the eu 's [ other ftas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) -- or at least each of the ones that i 've looked through for it -- have isds . 
  pretty sure that minimum wage has n't been frozen in eu members . 
  i think that you 're making a pretty compelling case for why isds is necessary . 
  iirc from tpp , it 's mostly per-item details and exceptions , like `` this item 's tariffs will be phased out over three years , and this almost-identical item 's tariffs will be phased out over seven '' . 
  if you did n't understand the reasons for wanting international trade , i suppose that this explanation is as good as any . 
  not in that i understand that it 's just a more-efficient way of achieving the same effect that would have happened without it . 
  an / r/the _ donald user posting material from * mother jones * ? 
  politics does make for strange bedfellows ... 
   the remaining ten per cent said the question was too difficult to answer , according to a poll of 1,600 from across russia conducted by the independent levada research centre last week . 
  wait a minute . 
  i thought that [ levada center 's operations had been suspended ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37278649 ) . 
   - false flag coup : check i would be very doubtful at this point that this was a false-flag coup . 
  that was an off-the-cuff suggestion from gulen . 
  rather , a reichstag fire -- the administration opportunistically taking advantage of a threat to national security to do whatever it wants to the opposition . 
   - lay claim to nearby lands citing ancient rights : check to be fair , this is n't specific to erdogan , right ? 
   - imprison academics and liberal thinkers en masse as i understand it , this is more of a purge of government employees . 
   - build the death camps i do n't see this . 
  you can only carry a bomb with so much power ( well , atomic weapons effectively rendered that limitation irrelevant , but up until that point ) . 
  an incendiary weapon uses stored energy already present on the ground , and japanese cities were quite vulnerable to fire at the time . 
  i disagree that the incendiaries were some sort of punishment -- they simply were more powerful in effect than conventional bombs . 
  well ... it 's not that the numbers conflict , but that they 're measuring two different things . 
  that article is saying that if congress changed our visa-free standard to measure something other than it measures today ( post-screening overstays ) , and also used 2 % , romania would qualify . 
  i 'm not ... actually sure why it would use that measurement , since that 's really a metric of the false negatives of the screening process . 
  yup , 's why i used `` almost '' . 
  also , [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombardment_of_fort_stevens ) . 
  and some operations in the war of 1812 . 
   was n't that elliot 's estranged father ? 
  the agent guy did n't become involved until the government was looking for e.t. 
  https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1187 this is the requirement i 'm referring to . 
  it 's reject , not overstay rate :  ( i ) the average number of refusals of nonimmigrant visitor visas for nationals of that country during --   ( i ) the two previous full fiscal years was less than 2.0 percent of the total number of nonimmigrant visitor visas for nationals of that country which were granted or refused during those years ; and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_waiver_program romania had a reject rate of 11.16 % in 2015 . 
  also , i dunno if bulgaria is also getting visa-free access , but bulgaria was at 17.26 % . 
  that 's not very close to 2 % . 
  if you mean the us , i doubt it . 
  maybe revising the visa evaluation system , but romania getting special treatment ? 
  unless canada 's and the us 's visa evaluation process throws a heck of a lot of false positives -- romania 's reject rate was something like ten times the limit for visa-free -- there will be overstays . 
  i assume that canada took that into account and accepted it as being worth the cost . 
  i personally care more about not making special exceptions in the rules . 
  if there 's not a legit justification , then the rule should n't be there for anyone . 
  if there is , then i 've no interest in starting a precedent of countries trying to get the us to punch holes in its rules . 
  i 'm really not sure about this whole `` you ca n't vote if you live overseas '' thing that seems to be popular in eu members and i guess is also present in moldova . 
  we let citizens abroad vote . 
  i wonder if that that alone might have flipped brexit , given that the britons who would be impacted most -- those who wanted to be able to live in other countries in the eu -- were excluded from the vote . 
  edit : nah , it would have made the brexit vote closer , but still only 700k votes . 
  hmm . 
  so imf funds ? 
  i 'm not familiar with the details , but [ this paper ] ( http://www.case-research.eu/upload/publikacja_plik/3414767_036.pdf ) plays down the impact of that :  the impact of foreign assistance can be substantial , even vital , only on a few occasions , especially when it is in the form of grants and debt reductions linked to performance . 
  most post-communist economies are simply too large and their transition to capitalism too costly for foreign assistance to have more than a marginal impact . 
  some of these economies are already heavily indebted , and this gives them little room for contracting new debt . 
  a far more important foreign impact may come from the inflow of western private investment and know-how . 
  however , internal reform efforts rather than external financial assistance are needed for this inflow to take place . 
    international financial organisations , especially the bwis , have been helpful for russia and poland by providing local reformers with modern analysis and expert policy advice . 
  they were also most helpful in pressing western creditors for a sizeable debt reduction of the polish debt and a fast removal of trade barriers to west european markets . 
  however , the sequence of reforms , their content and the speed of transition have been decided largely by the initial circumstances , the new long-term goals of the countries concerned and the various internal political and institutional factors during transition , rather than by the advice of the two institutions . 
  probably even has some islands off somewhere !, 
  most of them are real in the us , though they are missing context and they are n't as confusing as they sound . 
  the first one is a good example . 
  * what the british say : `` i hear what you say '' * what the british mean : `` i disagree and do not want to discuss it further '' * what others understand : `` he accepts my point of view '' the thing is , if you actually used this phrase over here , it 'd be something like this : `` i hear what you say , but i still think that we should ... '' or `` i mean , i hear what you say , but ... '' you would n't simply say `` i hear what you say . '', 
  and i bet that the same is true for the brits . 
  i think that probably a german non-native english speaker would figure that out , with the surrounding context . 
  that phrase would be be shorthand for `` the reason that i disagree with you is not that i do n't hear what you 're saying ... '' most of them seem to be simply cases where a sarcastic or polite understatement has become the norm . 
  think of `` well , that 's just great . '', 
  that means `` that 's awful '' , because it 's sarcastic . 
  at this point , nobody says that trying for the literal meaning . 
  the sarcasm there is probably dripping heavily enough that it 's possible to figure out that it 's sarcasm . 
  these are more-mild , so it 'd be easier to not understand the meaning . 
  also , some of the yellow column is , i suspect , overstated a bit for the humor value . 
  `` that is a very brave proposal '' is , i would bet ( though this is n't used in the us ) , not best translated as `` you are insane '' , but `` that proposal is unrealistic '' . 
  well , okay , i 'll grant the colors . 
  the reusing-an-overly-detailed-design thing is a bit of a sore spot , though . 
  zoom in on each , and you can see that the british design is actually done up to be a * flag * -- low-detail and stylized . 
  we should by all rights be able to do better . 
  the really idiotic thing about this is that ... so , i can understand us states having kinda craptacular flags . 
  they were small when they created most of them , and i vaguely imagine that they wanted to save artist work and reuse the state seal , plop it on a blue background . 
  great . 
  but the fact that the british secretary of state for defense has a better flag than the us secretary of state or us secretary of defense , both of which are * also * overly-detailed logos plopped on a flag , is a little disappointing . 
  yeah , but even with the tone it would n't be a `` normal '' convention in the us , whereas it sounds like it 's reasonably common in the uk . 
  here , i 'm gon na go down the list , and add a us column ( or at least my view of same ) : | what the british say | what the british mean | what others understand | us use british convention | | - | - | - | - | | i hear what you say | i disagree and do not want to discuss it further | he accepts my point of view | yes . 
  it would be phrased like `` i hear what you say , but < justification for disagreement  '' | | with the greatest respect ... | i think you are an idiot | he is listening to me | probably would come across . 
  the us equivalent is ` with all due respect ' . | | that 's not bad | that 's good | that 's poor | yes | | that is a very brave proposal | you are insane | he thinks i have courage | might be able to figure it out . 
  this ( and the related `` courageous proposal '' that i saw in * yes , minister * ) are not us conventions | | quite good | a bit disappointing | quite good | no | | i would suggest ... | do it or be prepared to justify yourself | think about the idea , but do what you like | yes | | oh , incidentally/by the way | the primary purpose of our discussion is ... | that is not very important | yes | | i was a bit disappointed that | i am annoyed that | it does n't really matter | yes | | very interesting | that is clearly nonsense | they are impressed | no | | i 'll bear it in mind | i 've forgotten it already | they will probably do it | yes | | i 'm sure it 's my fault | it 's your fault | why do they think it was their fault ? | yes | | you must come for dinner | it 's not an invitation , i 'm just being polite | i will get an invitation soon | yeah , probably . 
  similar non-serious invitations show up in the us , though normally '' ... sometime '' would be attached to the end of the phrase . 
  if there is n't a definite time , do n't be expecting that invitation . | | i almost agree | i do n't agree at all | he 's not far from agreement | no | | i only have a few minor comments | please re-write completely | he has found a few typos | probably not | | could we consider some other options | i do n't like your idea | they have not yet decided | yes |, 
  hell , you guys took censuses in algeria when you were there . 
   it 's not really 18 % anymore by the way since nobody knows the real population of us does the northern part of cyprus not do censuses ? 
  no , i mean in that it said that the eu wants the uk to stay . 
  yes . 
  people in lithuania do n't actually go on spree killings of gays all the time . 
  they may not be thrilled about gays , but neither was the majority of the us up until recently . 
  and hell , even if gay people in lithuania were afraid to open their doors to potential gay-killers , that 's still only a few percent of the population . 
  the other 96 % presumably do n't have that as their motive . 
  and while the suicide rate may be high , i do n't see why that 'd discourage one from opening the door . 
  i did think of concerns about [ home invasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/home_invasion ) . 
  but if that 's not it ... i do n't see why crime would otherwise be a big issue . 
  maybe burglars casing the joint ahead of time .
