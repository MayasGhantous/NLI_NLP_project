  why the heck ca n't all you guys in the eu release median income data ? 
  mean is normally higher than median , and it 's available for the us , but the eu does n't seem to release it . 
  http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-us-taxes-compare-internationally  us taxes are low relative to those in other developed countries . 
  in 2012 , us taxes at all levels of government represented 24 percent of gdp , compared with an average of 34 percent of gdp for the 34 member countries of the organisation for economic co-operation and development ( oecd ) . 
    among oecd countries , only chile and mexico collected less than the united states as a percentage of gdp . 
  in many european countries , taxes exceeded 40 percent of gdp . 
  but those countries generally provide more extensive government services than the united states does . 
  they do convey information , but you 're right that you could as easily have a language without them . 
  a typical middle-of-the-road us radiologist 's salary in the us is presently just shy of $ 300,000 / year . 
  that reflects the limited supply of people available relative to demand -- some people will go without . 
  if you want to pay more for a someone with more certifications to conduct your radiology work , a hospital certainly is n't going to refuse , but you 're excluding the people who would like to have work done but foe whom there is n't enough radiologist time to go around . 
  and i 've no reason to be biased in favor of whacking md salaries -- i 've a relative who 's a radiologist . 
  but economically , it does n't make sense to do this unless it 's producing very real , quantifiable results . 
  stares in the us are n't supposed to do that , [ and yet ... ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/where-every-state-stands-accepting-or-refusing-syrian-refugees-395050 ) . 
  quality post . 
  thanks !, 
  we do n't have a secretary of state for defense . 
  [ the uk does , though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretary_of_state_for_defence ) . 
  we have a [ secretary of state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_secretary_of_state ) and a [ secretary of defense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_secretary_of_defense ) . 
   in a statement issued saturday , the state department says the decision is based on security information indicating extremist groups are continuing aggressive efforts to attack u.s. citizens in areas of istanbul where they reside or frequent . 
  [ snip ]  the order applies only to the u.s. consulate general in istanbul , not to other u.s. diplomatic posts in turkey . 
  very , very localized fan-hitting ? 
  why not ? 
  it worked well for switzerland , germany , canada , and the us . 
   wtf ? 
  it was sold as a trade union in the nordics and thats all there is to us , who 'd want to be part of a federation the swiss , germans , canadians , and americans ? 
  brussels ai n't pyongyang in terms of information control . 
  not saying the quote is incorrect , but the site that you 're linking to , sott.net , is [ pretty crazy ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/laura_knight_jadczyk ) . 
  i 'd probably try to find better sources if possible ... 
  when the scandal over brexit not living up to its promises starts , we can call it brexitgate . 
  `` an - '' in english is a prefix meaning `` not '' , so it could just be * schluss * . 
  honestly , though , i thought that austria and germany were pretty aligned in all ways . 
  why is it a folly , and why do you see trade with poorer ex-colonies as advantageous but other countries as not ? 
  that seems like a curious dividing line ... 
   to be fair , most criticism about ttip is about megacorporations using the `` private tribunals '' against european states , and vietnam has n't really got many of those ... [ here 's the text of your fta with vietnam ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/html/154210.htm ) . 
  it 's got isds too . 
   if there was no sovereignty we would not have let you vote to leave . 
  this is a compliment , albeit in an overly-obsessed girlfriend meme sense ... 
  define `` good deal '' . 
  the us would be partly second column , partly third column . 
  for example `` quite good '' does n't have a negative connotation here -- you 'd get the literal interpretation , not the british meaning . 
  but `` i 'm a little disappointed '' means that you 're much more than a little disappointed , just as in the uk . 
  same thing with `` not bad '' being `` good '' -- that 'd be clear . 
  no language is free of phrases that are n't to be taken literally . 
  wait a minute ... are n't the two major adult figures the mom and that friendly federal agent guy ? 
  they are n't assholes .

  looks like they 're comparable in percentage of decline , except that moldova has been worse-off in absolute terms . 
  if you compare to , say , [ poland ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/poland-gdp-per-capita-ppp.png?s=polnygdppcapppcd&amp;v=201610011526q&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231 ) , it 's a very different story . 
  hmm . 
  i had n't thought of that . 
  maybe that 's a major factor ... kinda like how people in large cities tend to treat beggars differently from people in the country since they run into them all the time . 
  do you guys get a lot of door-to-door salesmen ? 
  i know that many years back , it was far more common in the us . 
  i see very few now . 
  i had jehovah 's witnesses once in my life . 
  other than that ... in the past ten years , i can remember three people selling people door-to-door . 
  some years back , you 'd sporadically get some kid selling girl scout cookies , but afaict , even they have moved from door-to-door to just setting up camp in high-traffic areas with a folding table . 
  i actually wondered if it might be illegal to do door-to-door sales over here , since it seems so dead , but apparently [ it 's protected by the first amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/door-to-door#banning_and_regulation ) . 
  i think it just became uneconomical -- the labor costs of paying someone to walk around made it not viable . 
  i do get items hung on my doorknob occasionally ( restaurant coupons , for example ) , but those people do n't even bother to ring the bell -- they just leave the thing on the doorknob and move on . 
   b : `` and what would the allies have learned from world war 2 ? '', 
    a : `` simple . 
  you have to start earlier , to be done sooner ! '', 
  hmm . 
  i know it 's a joke , but i think that the uk did take the ironic use of [ `` peace for our time '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_for_our_time ) as a condemnation of anything that looks like appeasement . 
  us too , and probably any number of other countries . 
  the takeaway being that it 's just a bad idea to try to buy off countries that have crossed the line : best to address the issue , even if there 's a cost . 
  also , churchill was guilt-tripping the us about not entering world war ii something * awful * . 
  i knew that he 'd been doing it via diplomatic channels , but i had n't ever heard the full original of his `` we shall fight them on the beaches ... '' speech until a couple of weeks ago . 
  here 's [ the last bit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n89cpc4vl60&amp;t=10m16s ) -- he was really laying it on thick . 
  it 's be interesting to know how much of the us cold war positioning [ and this post-world-war-ii shift to a more-aggressive military position ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lts6a0ordqu ) derived from all the post-war criticism ( both internal and external ) of avoiding military involvement early in world war ii . 
  also ... the us has n't really lost any wars , other than in part if you count the csa losing to the usa , in the sense of really * losing * something serious in the outcome . 
  the worst outcomes were the war of 1812 ( `` invade canada , get kicked back out , kick british counter-invasion in us south out , everyone decides to knock it off '' ) and the vietnam war ( `` overseas leader being backed loses popular support , faced with having to effectively permanently occupy a country and put down rebellion to ensure his control '' ) . 
  there were no territorial cessations or compensation for war ever paid . 
  outside of the american civil and american revolutionary wars , almost no us mainland soil has ever been shelled or occupied . 
  there are no minefields to demine , no bombs to dig up from under houses . 
  there were no foreign armies looting or raping the mainland . 
  there have been no dams , houses , and factories to rebuild . 
  wars have been increasingly bloodless ( on our side ) , overwhelming victories the closer-to-present-day one gets . 
  i wonder how much that affects the popular perception and decisions made relating to war -- war 's always had a fairly-positive , or at least not-particularly-negative outcome here . 
  you know , i played [ * metro : last light * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metro:_last_light ) a while back . 
  and while i liked it , it seemed over-the-top grim , with cartoonishly-evil villains . 
  i mean , it had some crazy world with ideologically-crazed nazis and power-hungry communists at the * same time * and both were busy killing people off without much of a care in the world . 
  it was n't until partway through that i realized that it had a ukrainian dev team and was based on a book series from the area and that no , that 's actually kinda what things were like during world war ii for them . 
  it 's just that nazis and communists occupy very different slots in my mental world . 
  nazis are a world war ii thing and communists are a cold war thing and nobody was off just killing people * en masse * because that 's not what people do , well , aside from the jews in the holocaust . 
  because in us pop culture , those are the pigeonholes that they fit into . 
  intellectually , i knew otherwise , but pop culture so disconnected the two that the whole scenario came off as unrealistic and unrecognizable . 
   ( detroit used to have a serious arson/vandalism problem on october 30 , known as `` devil 's night . '' ), 
  i remember this being the core of the movie [ * the crow * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_crow_\\ ( 1994_film \\ ) ) . 
  ... so you 're telling me that if i walked up to a house in poland or lithuania and rang the doorbell , that someone would walk up to the door , look through their peephole or whatever , and then just walk back to the tv or kitchen or computer ? 
  i mean , not saying that that 's not the case . 
  i 'd just never heard of it , and it 's very different from what i 'd expect over here . 
  that sword cuts two ways -- it also means that there 's a greater amount of medical care available , which means that people can now receive services that they would n't have otherwise been able to receive . 
  could be . 
  i 'm not rabid about him , but i liked [ * uzumaki * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uzumaki ) -- another insanity-laden horror by him -- more than this one .
