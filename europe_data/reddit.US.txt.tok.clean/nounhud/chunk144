  really ? 
  i do n't see why remembering the dead always has to be sad . 
  [ dia de muertos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/day_of_the_dead ) is much more associated with honoring the dead and the dead in general than halloween in the us . 
  but it 's not a sad occasion . 
  why not trick-or-treat in a commieblock ? 
  i 'd think that the density would improve your loot output . 
  hell , the residents association could do it up as a haunted house . 
  are they controlled access at the main door or something ? 
  well , the * pumpkins * are american ... 
  i absolutely guarantee people will be doing `` sexy donald trump '' this halloween , given the timing , and that next week google images will know about it . 
  if sexy hitler has been done , sexy anything is an option . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halloween to expand further :  in england , from the medieval period , [ 135 ] up until the 1930s , [ 136 ] people practiced the christian custom of souling on halloween , which involved groups of soulers , both protestant and catholic , [ 102 ] going from parish to parish , begging the rich for soul cakes , in exchange for praying for the souls of the givers and their friends . 
  [ 83 ] in scotland and ireland , guising -- children disguised in costume going from door to door for food or coins -- is a traditional halloween custom , and is recorded in scotland at halloween in 1895 where masqueraders in disguise carrying lanterns made out of scooped out turnips , visit homes to be rewarded with cakes , fruit and money . 
  [ 119 ] the practice of guising at halloween in north america is first recorded in 1911 , where a newspaper in kingston , ontario reported children going `` guising '' around the neighborhood . 
  [ 137 ]   american historian and author ruth edna kelley of massachusetts wrote the first book length history of halloween in the us ; the book of hallowe'en ( 1919 ) , and references souling in the chapter `` hallowe'en in america '' . 
  [ 138 ] in her book , kelley touches on customs that arrived from across the atlantic ; `` americans have fostered them , and are making this an occasion something like what it must have been in its best days overseas . 
  all halloween customs in the united states are borrowed directly or adapted from those of other countries '' . 
  [ 139 ] if it makes folks feel better . 
   this completely destroys the notion that '' he only uses islam for power '' . 
  he is a sunni islamist who has been incorporating islam into politics , way before he had the prospect of '' controlling the people '' . 
  i think i 'm gon na side with seneca the younger on this one :  religion is regarded by the common people as true , by the wise as false , and by the rulers as useful . 
   the us already kinda tried with gulen ( they just okeyed the whole move source , please . 
  ehhh ... not in referendums with minimum turnout . 
  there , not turning up is a valid strategy to achieve one result . 
  risky , but valid . 
  i understand that there is and has been a push to [ move an increasing amount of work from doctors to rns ( registered nurses ) in the us ] ( https://onlinenursing.simmons.edu/nursing-blog/nurse-practitioners-scope-of-practice-map/ ) because a doctor really was not necessary and it was simply unnecessarily constraining the supply of medical labor . 
  that constriction is [ great if you 're already a doctor , as it drives up your wages ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/5136y7/japans_unprecedented_warning_to_uk_over_brexit/d798823/ ) , but is costly for everyone else . 
  that seems sensible to me . 
  being stricter need not be moving towards a more-optimal outcome -- if i relax restrictions on medical labor sufficiently to , say , cut a third off the cost of medical care , how many more negative outcomes will i see , and is that tradeoff one that moves me closer to an optimal outcome ? 
  it never quite `` clicked '' for me why people like this one so much -- seems like a weird combination of fears ... insanity , claustrophobia , body modification -- but i guess it 's probably one of the most-claustrophobia-intensive stories out there . 
  thanks for the clarification !, 
  whether-or-not this is the right level of `` locality '' or not , i did very strongly think that the previous rule was confusing . 
  now that you mention it , i do notice that national-level media tends to focus on sensational crimes that have disproportionately-little real world effect . 
   because maybe some names are similar , but of different drugs . 
  i can think of a few cases -- `` paracetamol '' is `` acetaminophen '' in the us . 
  but how honestly common is that , and realistically , would it be cheaper to just provide a table to map one to the other ? 
  it might be valuable for countries to look at seriously revising and lowering licensing requirements for various fields in medicine . 
  if your requirements are not actually in line with what 's honestly necessary to do a good job , you 're making your public far worse-off than need be the case . 
  ( this applies at least as much to the us , i might add . ), 
   several leaked documents have shown that the us is willing to spy on european companies and r&d facilities if you 're talking about state-driven economic espionage , can you please provide a source ? 
  i 've yet to see one . 
  note that this is n't all that unusual . 
  the us left/greens have some really irritating-to-me positions on nuclear power dating to cold war positions that if it 's nuclear , it 's bad . 
  you guys we 'd almost a counterexample to that with the lib dems making ab all-in effort for change . 
  that * could * have worked . 
  also , barron let brexit out the door and was expecting that this would n't happen . 
  the report being reported on from the rand corporation was posted here and discussed four months ago . 
  [ my position remains the same ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qesjd/eastern_europe_how_dangerous_nato_really_is/d4si08q/ ) . 
  it 's not that their points are n't true , it 's that they do n't represent serious consequences . 
  russia could take parts of alaska , too . 
  it 's just that ( a ) it would n't neutralize the ability of the other side to respond , ( b ) russia would lose any ensuing conventional war , and ( c ) it would put russian military in a horrendous position . 
  france will be so excited to hear that they 're anglo-saxon !, 
  the normans were anglo-saxon all along !, 
  1066 was an inside job !, 
  i do know they did also execute communist political officials . 
  the individual parts , afaict , are not ordered -- they simply cover a variety of issues related to the main article . 
  op had two comments containing the text of the main bit ; unfortunately , the second comment was not a reply to the first . 
    hmm . 
  i 'm using `` nation '' as a synonym for `` country '' , which is the norm in the us . 
    as i have explaned multiple times to you dirti liberals , that is wrong . 
  nations means blod and lingual relation . 
  that * is * one definition , but there 's also a definition that is a synonym of a country , where what matters is the political divisions , and this is normally what 's used in the us . 
  you would n't hear of , say , german-americans being called a `` nation '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation  the word `` nation '' is sometimes used as synonym for :   * state ( polity ) or sovereign state : a government which controls a specific territory , which may or may not be associated with any particular ethnic group   * country : a geographic territory , which may or may not have an affiliation with a government or ethnic group   thus the phrase `` nations of the world '' could be referring to the top-level governments ( as in the name for the united nations ) , various large geographical territories , or various large ethnic groups of the planet . 
    kosovo is recognized by most un members . 
    some countries are redy to withdraw their support . 
  also the most important ones like china and russia see it as part of serbia . 
  well , i guess it 's hard to measure `` importance '' , but the bulk of the eu members , canada and the us do not . 
  which countries are planning to withdraw recognition ? 
    russia 's invaded and annexed or established frozen conflicts in several neighbors . 
    where ? 
  south ossetia , abkhazia , crimea , donbas . 
    this was as per request from those members . 
    is still a provocation . 
  ( god i hope trump wins ) well ... okay , i guess that 's fair . 
  whether or not something is requested is , i agree , not really elegant to how russia sees it . 
  i would say that it 's not very reasonable to see it as provocative , but ...   there are more forces on the russian side there . 
    because its their country , which is sorounded by hostile nuclear misiles . 
  the same goes for estonia , latvia , and lithuania . 
    even if there were n't , 4000 soldiers across all the baltics are n't going to be taking over russia . 
  what they do mean is that any conflict in the area is immediately going to involve forces from a bunch of nato members . 
    i will pray for your god forsaken country . 
  i will pray for trumps victory . 
  well ... i guess i appreciate the sentiment . 
    nato would easily win in a conflict -- but given past history in the region , allies providing a response has been a concern , and this aims at addressing that . 
    you have to be joking , ( 1 ) if nato uses nukes than mad ( 2 ) nato can not win in a war against such an enamy as russia , ever . 
  even if nato takes moscow , it would quite litelarely need to kill all russian it finds to win , remembre , russia has good friends around the world , they would not alowe any nato invasion of the last power to stand up for freedom and what is right . 
  well , yeah , should qualify that to be a `` conventional '' conflict . 
    but given past history in the region , allies providing a response has been a concern , and this aims at addressing that . 
    are you copy-pasting this from your propaganda leflets ? 
  what past history ? 
  the asembaly of nuclear misiles in turkey ? 
  or continues spy plane fly owers ? 
  oh thats right its nato who is doing that no , i 'm talking about france not aiding poland in world war ii . 
  you 'll see it frequently referenced by poles on here . 
  by putting forces in-place , it means that any attack by russia on , say , estonia of the sort that was made against ukraine year before last would mean that the people of many nato countries would wake up and see the news that their militaries had been attacked by russia . 
  that would help lower the political bar for military response , and helps assuage concerns in those countries that other members might just sit the conflict out . 
    we also leave   lol #afganistan well , that 's fair . 
  i should say that we 're not occupying it . 
  we have a military presence , but only at the request of the government .
