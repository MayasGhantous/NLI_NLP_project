  these units are allocated to nato and the eu . 
  there is also a small cbrn decontamination unit for mainly national purposes ... the country has recently acquired new highly capable reconnaissance vehicles , new high-tech eod / iedd robots and three new sophisticated water purification units that provide a very high quality of drinking water . 
  okay , this is getting a wee bit too thinly-connected to reality . 
  hmmm . 
  how so ? 
  i am kind of annoyed by the levada center shutdown , since this is precisely the sort of thing that i 'd like to know how many people buy into . 
  you need actual polls for that : anecdotal data is just not able to do that . 
  hmm . 
  afaik , the holocaust did n't really play any significant role in determining the outcome of the war . 
  can you clarify ? 
  note : from 2015 : [ russia extends sanctions to include montenegro ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-gets-revenge-for-sanctions-agains-russia-08-14-2015 )  the montenegrin institute for statistics said that of a total of 350 million euro worth exports in 2014 , only 4 million euro referred to russia , mainly meat products and wine . 
    in 2014 , montenegro imported goods worth only about 3.1 million euro from russia , a fraction of its total import needs . 
  just to provide scale . 
  that said , people are losing money on this , and they were n't forced to do this , so no sense in poking fun at it . 
  [ continued from parent ]  mr putin knows he has a problem and is looking for ways to change the system while retaining personal power and dealing with the problems of elections and legitimacy . 
  he may promote himself as a new national leader , a russian late-period deng xiaoping . 
  that would allow him to combine confrontation with the west with some degree of economic liberalisation ( he has recently appointed sergei kiriyenko , a liberal of the late 1990s , as his deputy chief of staff ) . 
  but russia is not china . 
  and mr putin will be aware that , as de tocqueville said , the most dangerous moment for a bad government is when it begins to reform . 
    the russian empire had been overdue for transformation back in 1914 , but tsar nicholas ii 's insistence on ruling like a 17th-century absolute monarch made it impossible . 
  in the 1930s stalin managed to hold the empire together by extreme violence . 
  after the soviet union finally expired in 1991 , the new regime gave federalism a chance for a decade . 
  but since mr putin has been in charge , he has been trying to hold russia together with the same anachronistic methods that had pushed his country into decline and political upheaval at earlier points in its history . 
  unless russia can complete the transformation into a modern nation state that began in 1991 , what mr putin tries to present as his country 's resurgence may in fact be one of the last phases of its decline . 
  one of the other parts mentioned by / u/sigakoer at the bottom of the article . 
  [ ** take care of russia ** ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21708881-mr-putin-not-setting-about-it-best-way-take-care-russia )  but mr putin is not setting about it in the best way   when boris yeltsin walked out of his office for the last time , at the end of 1999 , he famously told mr putin : `` beregite rossiyu ! '' , which translates as `` take care of russia '' or `` preserve russia '' . 
  but what did he mean by `` russia '' ? 
  was it a new country born from the 1991 revolution , or was it an old russia restored after the soviet regime ? 
  unlike other soviet republics , it could not celebrate its independence from the soviet union because it had been its core . 
  nor could it hitch its wagon to the european union and nato -- it was simply too big . 
    russia 's freedom in the 1990s had been sustained not by the institutions of an enlightened state but by a plurality of economic and political actors , the weakness of the security services and yeltsin 's determination to defend it . 
  his legitimacy and support rested largely on the russian people 's rejection of the communist system that produced plenty of missiles and tanks but little that anyone wanted to consume . 
    when they rejected communism in the 1990s , yeltsin and his colleagues portrayed russia not as a new nation state but as an heir to its pre-bolshevik self , borrowing many of its symbols , including its flag . 
  they depicted the soviet period as an anomaly that had interrupted the course of russian history . 
  but they could not come up with a clear identity and a destination for the new post-soviet russia . 
    the 1991 revolution had been largely bloodless because the old nomenklatura retained its economic and often its political power . 
  ( yeltsin himself was a former communist party boss . ), 
  it did not and could not bring in a new elite because after 74 years of soviet rule there was none . 
  and although the oligarchs who in the 1990s took over the commanding heights of the russian economy and the media had all the appearance of an elite , they lacked any sense of responsibility for their country . 
    it was partly the failures and in-fighting of that westernised ruling class that prompted yeltsin to pick mr putin as his successor in 2000 . 
  by that time the russian economy was starting to benefit from the transition to a market economy , complete with coffee shops and the first ikea superstore . 
    mr putin was neither a liberal nor a stalinist . 
  his manifesto , published on the eve of the new millennium , was all about the value to the russian people of a strong , centralised state . 
  an opinion poll in january 2000 found that 55 % of the population expected mr putin to return russia to the status of a great and respected derzhava , which most russians equate with `` fear of their country '' . 
  only 8 % thought he would bring russia closer to the west . 
  today half the population reckons that mr putin has indeed restored russia 's position as a great power . 
    mr putin took the next logical step : he incorporated the soviet period into the historical continuum of russian statehood . 
  soon after coming to power he ordered the restoration of the soviet anthem , which had been abolished when the soviet union collapsed . 
  new lyrics were set to the music originally composed in 1938 , at the height of stalin 's terror . 
  while russian liberals cringed , most people saw it as a fairly harmless symbolic gesture to placate ageing communist party voters . 
  after a decade of freedom under yeltsin it seemed impossible that russia would lapse back into stalinism . 
    in a press conference in 2004 mr putin said : `` despite all the difficulties , we managed to preserve the nucleus of that giant , the soviet union . 
  and we called this new country the russian federation . '' he was not interested in its communist ideology or its hopeless central planning system . 
  what mattered to him was the state , which had served the russian empire and the soviet union equally well . 
    alexander yakovlev , the author of gorbachev 's reforms , understood the challenge better than anyone else . 
  in 1985 he had written to gorbachev : `` for a thousand years we have been ruled by people and not by laws ... what we are talking about is not the dismantling of stalinism but a replacement of a 1,000-year old model of statehood . '' that model was never properly dismantled , and mr putin set about restoring it . 
  according to andrei illarionov , his adviser until 2005 , mr putin was haunted by fears of disintegration and saw the 1990s as a period not of freedom and stabilisation but of chaos . 
    in trying to preserve the nucleus of an old empire , mr putin eliminated all alternative power centres . 
  he stopped direct regional elections , standardised legislation across the whole of russia and appointed his own representatives to the regions . 
  he thus destroyed the principle of federalism , which had kept russia together and politically stable throughout the economic upheavals of the 1990s . 
  like many of his predecessors , including stalin , mr putin believed , and still believes , that a country of russia 's size and ethnic complexity can be kept together only by centralising economic resources and political power , and that the security services are the best tool for achieving that . 
    yet moscow , st petersburg and even kazan are modern european cities . 
  they have little in common with chechnya , a tyrannical state where elements of sharia law have been reintroduced . 
  they also have little in common with russia 's grim , small towns in the hinterland which form the core of mr putin 's electorate . 
  the only way in which these differences can be peacefully reconciled is through decentralisation and political competition . 
  rather than being run as a centralised state , russia would work much better as a federation in which each region can develop in its own way . 
  this idea of russia as a `` united states '' was first voiced by the decembrists , a group of aristocratic revolutionaries who led an unsuccessful uprising in 1825 . 
    to head off such notions , mr putin needed a unifying narrative about the past . 
  the only one available was the soviet victory in the second world war , which he presented as an exemplar of state power rather than a triumph of human values achieved by all allies . 
  the sanctification of that victory , and stalin 's role in it , has become the main ideological foundation of mr putin 's velvet stalinism , disguised as patriotism -- an old mix of russian orthodoxy , state nationalism and autocracy . 
    as a victor in the second world war , russia was never forced to reject stalinism in the way that germany was forced to reject nazism , even though the two regimes had much in common . 
  in an insult to the millions of stalin 's victims , the kremlin has recently called memorial , a long-established human-rights organisation set up to draw attention to the crimes of stalin 's regime , a `` foreign agent '' -- a synonym for `` traitor '' . 
    `` putinism '' , writes mr gudkov of the levada centre , `` is a modified version of a repressive and centralised state system which imitates the soviet style of a totalitarian regime . '' but for all his faults , mr putin is not a bloodthirsty tyrant . 
  although he has resorted to coercion and selective violence , both at home and abroad , he is neither willing nor able to reproduce the economic foundation of stalin 's regime or impose a reign of terror . 
  his system uses more subtle methods of control and manipulation such as rigging elections , demoralising or co-opting the liberal opposition and , most important , deploying television as a propaganda tool . 
    old injuries   the reason russia 's current nationalistic , anti-american propaganda is so much more effective than the soviet version is that people choose to believe it . 
  it plays to their feelings of jealousy , resentment and victimisation . 
  as mr gudkov notes , television propaganda exploits the syndrome of `` learned helplessness '' -- a psychological condition where people who have been repeatedly abused give up control and start believing that `` nothing depends on us '' . 
  having a mighty enemy , such as america , helps alleviate their feelings of failure and weakness . 
  russia 's anti-americanism is based not on any real interaction between the two countries but on russia 's domestic failures . 
  america 's perceived aggression allows mr putin to present himself as the leader of a country at war . 
    the extraordinary support for mr putin ( 82 % ) as a head of state who stands up to this american aggression contrasts starkly with the deep contempt people feel for the power elite generally , whom they see as corrupt , amoral and callous . 
  they applaud the annexation of crimea but do not want to accept any responsibility for it . 
  like most other people , russians on the whole have little interest in the outside world . 
  they care far more about their families and their jobs than they do about foreign adventures . 
  they have no wish to go to war . 
    russia 's perceived resurgence is not a sign of strength but of deep weakness and insecurity . 
  its anachronistic state can not deal with modern challenges , resolve contradictions and injustices or offer any vision of a common future . 
  russia 's regional diversity , its growing inequality and the contrast between the urban middle classes and the paternalistic periphery will remain causes of tension . 
    as dominic lieven , a british historian of the russian empire , has observed : `` for most of russian history ... aggression was the same thing as survival . 
  in the 20th century tsarist and soviet russia smashed itself to pieces by competition first with the germanic bloc in central europe and then with anglo-americans . 
  the limited recovery of russian power under mr putin can not hide the fact that russia is weaker than it has been in the last 300 years . '' [ continued in child ],
