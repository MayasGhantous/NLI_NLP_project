  his initial popularity as president rested on the war he had waged against chechnya in 1999 , and his sagging ratings were restored by the war in ukraine . 
    yet mr putin would not unleash a war for ideological reasons . 
  he will continue to present his actions as defensive . 
  what he is ultimately after is a new pact along the lines of the yalta agreement after the second world war which would create a buffer zone between russia and the west . 
  in the absence of such a deal , mr putin will continue to confront his perceived enemies by both non-military and military means . 
  western sanctions only reinforce his determination . 
    mr putin has no plans to conquer the world . 
  he may be impervious to logic or reason , but he is highly sensitive to force . 
  he knows he can not afford a conventional war with the west , but he could quickly raise the stakes to the verge of a nuclear war , believing that the other side would always blink first . 
  over the past 16 years the west has done little to persuade him otherwise .

  [ ** the fog of wars ** ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21708880-adventures-abroad-boost-public-support-home-fog-wars )  adventures abroad boost public support at home   russia has no intention of going to war with america or its allies . 
  instead it will act through non-military means `` to undermine the general political and strategic potential of major western powers , to disrupt national self-confidence , to increase social and industrial unrest , to stimulate all forms of disunity ... anti-british talk will be plugged among americans , anti-american talk among british . 
  germans will be taught to abhor both anglo-saxon powers . 
  where suspicions exist , they will be fanned ; where not , ignited . '' so wrote george kennan , the `` wise man '' of american diplomacy , in a famous telegram from moscow in 1946 . 
  seventy years later the telegram seems as relevant as ever , because the system that kennan described is being rebuilt . 
    russia has launched cyber-attacks , spread disinformation and interfered in the domestic affairs of both neighbouring and faraway countries . 
  its military jets are buzzing nato 's ships and flying close to american reconnaissance aircraft in europe . 
  the american government has formally accused russia of meddling in the presidential election by means of extensive hacking . 
  in syria it has subverted america 's efforts to defeat bashar al-assad and threatened to shoot down american warplanes if they attack his army . 
    the bnd , germany 's foreign-intelligence agency , is investigating russian activity in germany after russia 's state television ran a fake story about a 13-year-old russian-german girl being raped by arab immigrants in berlin . 
  spread through social media , the story sparked protests against angela merkel , the german chancellor . 
    russia has provided funds for the french right-wing party of marine le pen . 
  rt , the kremlin 's foreign-language propaganda tv channel , has offered a regular spot to nigel farage , the former leader of britain 's far-right ukip party . 
  russia 's support for donald trump , the republican presidential candidate , who has also appeared on rt , has become a talking-point in america 's forthcoming election . 
    none of this is particularly new . 
  subversion , disinformation and forgery , combined with the use of special forces , were at the heart of the soviet union 's intelligence services . 
  the kgb had a special department responsible for `` active measures '' , designed to weaken and undermine the west . 
  it stirred racial tension by posting bogus letters from the ku klux klan , planted stories about aids having been invented in america as a biological weapon and put it about that john f. kennedy 's murder was plotted by the cia . 
    yuri andropov , the head of the kgb in the 1970s and one of mr putin 's heroes , set up special courses to train operatives in the use of active measures . 
  at the height of the cold war 15,000 officers were working on psychological and disinformation warfare . 
  when the soviet union collapsed , the department was renamed but never dismantled . 
    modern technology has helped it widen its scope ; the kremlin now uses large numbers of `` trolls '' that spread disinformation and propaganda through online communities and social media . 
  it also helps russia to sow confusion by putting out multiple versions of events . 
  according to alexander vershbow , nato 's deputy secretary-general and a former american ambassador to moscow , it is `` an endlessly changing storyline designed to obfuscate and confuse to create the impression that there are no reliable facts , and therefore no truth . ''   this echoes kennan 's observation in 1946 that `` the very disrespect of russians for objective truth -- indeed , their disbelief in its existence -- leads them to view all stated facts as instruments for furtherance of one ulterior purpose or another . '' unlike soviet propaganda , which aimed to promote communist ideology , modern russian propaganda aims to show that western policies are as rigged and hypocritical as russian ones . 
    assessing the effectiveness of these russian attempts to influence opinion abroad is hard because they often tap into existing sentiments , from disenchantment with elites to resentment of immigrants . 
  but research by finland 's institute of international affairs has found that russian propaganda has had very little impact on mainstream western media and has never resulted in any change in policy . 
  a strong and confident west should find it easy to brush off russian media assaults . 
  but sober political thinkers have noted some signs of a `` putin panic '' in the west , and mr putin himself has said that america 's attempts to present russia as an `` evil empire '' indicates `` russia 's growing influence and significance '' . 
    in the eyes of his own people , mr putin has restored his country 's status to that of the soviet union . 
  according to a recent report by the aleksanteri institute in finland , a think-tank , `` the west 's response to the crimea annexation partially did exactly what putin had demanded : putting forward the notion of western weakness in the face of russia 's superior ` hybrid warfare ' capabilities implies respect and even fear of russia as a powerful global actor . ''   the country 's intervention in syria in the autumn of last year was designed to reinforce the image of russia as a global power . 
  it did change the course of events , saving bashar al-assad from a seemingly inevitable fall , and made the humanitarian situation in syria far worse . 
  but russia cares little about the future of syria . 
  it sees the war there as a way of forcing america to recognise a russian sphere of influence in the former soviet union . 
    weakness in strength   the wars in ukraine , georgia and syria have demonstrated russia 's willingness and ability to use its military power to achieve political goals . 
  but they are not a sign of russia 's strength ; instead , they indicate deep insecurity . 
  as kennan wrote : `` at [ the ] bottom of [ the ] kremlin 's neurotic view of world affairs is [ the ] traditional and instinctive russian sense of insecurity ... this thesis provides justification for that increase of the military and police power of the russian state ... basically this is only the steady advance of uneasy russian nationalism , a centuries-old movement in which conceptions of offence and defence are inextricably confused . '' this nationalism continues to shape russia 's behaviour today . 
    mr putin sees russia 's wars as a form of self-defence , driven by the need to deter the west . 
  that is what he meant when he gathered the country 's elite in the kremlin 's gilded hall to announce russia 's `` reunification '' with crimea on march 18th 2014 . 
  `` like a mirror , the situation in ukraine reflects what has been happening in the world over the past several decades . 
  our western partners , led by the united states of america , prefer not to be guided by international law but by the rule of the gun . '' in ukraine , he said , the west had crossed a red line . 
  western actions left russia with no choice but to send its troops into crimea . 
    yet only a few days earlier mr putin had told the german chancellor , angela merkel , that there were no russian troops in crimea . 
  `` he lives in another world , '' she was reported to have said to barack obama . 
  in his world the west was trying to undermine russia . 
  the colour revolutions across the former soviet union and the protests in russia in the winter of 2011-12 were western plots . 
    yet his view of the west as a threat was not , as many have argued , his starting position ; it developed in response to changes inside russia and the former soviet republics . 
  when mr putin became president in 2000 , he showed no overt hostility towards america or the west , despite a recent nato bombing raid on belgrade without a un resolution that had triggered a shrill anti-american response . 
  in his first interview with britain 's bbc , mr putin said : `` i can not imagine my own country in isolation from europe , so it is hard for me to visualise nato as an enemy . '' russia , he said , might become a member of nato if it were treated as an equal partner . 
  even when the three baltic states joined nato in spring 2004 , mr putin insisted that relations with the defence organisation were `` developing positively '' and he had `` no concerns about the expansion of nato '' . 
    the breaking-point in mr putin 's relationship with the west came towards the end of that year when several seemingly unrelated events coincided . 
  the first was a terrorist attack on a school in beslan , in the north causasus , in which 1,200 people , mostly children , were taken hostage . 
  after russia 's special forces stormed the school , leaving 333 people dead , mr putin accused the west of trying to undermine russia . 
  he cancelled regional elections and handed more powers to the security services . 
    the next key event was the dismemberment and expropriation of the yukos oil firm , which further emboldened and enriched the siloviki with roots in the soviet kgb . 
  they thrived on the idea of a western conspiracy and an exaggerated sense of the west as an enemy .

  [ ** wheels within wheels ** ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21708877-how-mr-putin-keeps-country-under-control-wheels-within-wheels )  how mr putin keeps the country under control   mystery , miracle and authority are three powers alone able to hold the conscience of people captive , explains fyodor dostoyevsky 's grand inquisitor in `` the brothers karamazov '' . 
  mr putin has mastered all three . 
  yet none of these is as important as secrecy , the main tool of a good spy . 
  nobody really knows what goes on behind the kremlin 's thick walls , or inside mr putin 's head . 
  but several things are becoming clearer . 
  mr putin 's rule is turning increasingly personal ; a generational shift is taking place within his entourage ; and the fsb , the successor organisation to the kgb , is emerging as the main mechanism for exercising power , often at the expense of all other security services , including the police . 
    mr putin had always relied heavily on his former kgb colleagues , but after the annexation of crimea the expansion of the fsb gained new momentum and greater public legitimacy . 
  it now openly wields political and economic power . 
  mr putin has recently appointed three members of his security detail and one former kgb officer as regional governors . 
    after stalin 's death in 1953 , the kgb was a `` combat division '' of the communist party , tightly controlled by its central committee , which did not want to see a repeat of stalin 's purges . 
  when the party collapsed in 1991 the kgb lost its lustre , but the new rulers never dismantled it . 
  though the party could not survive without ideology , the kgb could . 
    today the fsb is personally overseen by mr putin . 
  `` there is no political control over the fsb . 
  it is a self-contained and closed system , '' says andrei soldatov , an expert on russia 's security services . 
  behind the scenes , the fsb controls the investigative committee , the russian equivalent of america 's fbi . 
  the prosecutor 's office , in effect , has no independent oversight of the fsb and the courts take their cue from it . 
    on september 18th , the day of the parliamentary elections , kommersant , an authoritative daily newspaper , reported the kremlin 's plan to fold other parts of the former kgb , including the foreign intelligence services ( svr ) and the federal protection service , which is responsible for guarding top russian officials , into a new megastructure : the ministry for state security , or mgb , which is what the kgb was called under stalin . 
  the date of the report is telling . 
  the parliament has become an appendix of the fsb . 
  as tatyana stanovaya of the carnegie moscow centre notes , the fsb drafts most of the repressive laws that are rubber-stamped by the parliament . 
    the fsb is a notoriously opaque organisation , but one of its most powerful figures appears to be sergei korolev , who used to head the internal-security department that can investigate the staff of all security services , including its own . 
  he has recently been promoted to the job of overseeing all financial and business activity in russia . 
  his team was behind most of the high-profile arrests of governors , mayors and policemen in recent years . 
  these started with two young generals from the interior ministry , denis sugrobov , the head of the ministry 's economic-crime and anti-corruption department , and his deputy , boris kolesnikov . 
  both in their mid-30s , they had been installed in their jobs by dmitry medvedev , russia 's current prime minister and former president , and given carte blanche to go after corrupt senior officials . 
    yet soon afterwards they became victims of a sting operation set up by the fsb . 
  in his prison cell mr kolesnikov suffered a head injury and six weeks later , during a formal interrogation , he apparently killed himself by jumping out of a sixth-floor window . 
  mr sugrobov remains in jail . 
    the public is regularly treated to footage of governors , policemen and officials being led away in handcuffs , their homes being searched and enormous piles of cash being confiscated . 
  the most spectacular arrest so far has been that of dmitry zakharchenko , a police colonel who had hidden $ 120m in cash in his sister 's flat . 
  a few weeks earlier the fsb had raided a vast mansion belonging to andrei belyaninov , the head of the customs service and a former kgb officer , and found $ 670,000 in cash , a one-kilo gold ingot and assorted old-master paintings .
