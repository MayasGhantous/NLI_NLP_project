  the abda coalition was unable to achieve successful unity of effort due to differing objectives and strategies of component members . 
  the coalition established a framework for command in separate components as opposed to a unified force , resulting in ineffective control of allied forces and hindered its ability to operate as a military force . 
  as a result , combined arms operations did not occur among the abda components , allowing the japanese to excel in their use of combined forces . 
    the implications for future coalitions include unity of command , common strategy , force integration , training , and doctrine . 
  unity of command needs to occur among components . 
  strategy has to be one of a common purpose or goal . 
  conflicting goals and strategies affect the ability of a coalition to operate as a unified command . 
  the nations involved in coalitions need a common command structure . 
  separate coalition forces do not maximize combat power . 
  combined arms require integration of military components from air , ground , and sea , to complement their power on the battlefield or sea . 
  command structure requires an effective communications system among components . 
  a unified communications system enables the commander to direct component forces and provide appropriate combined arms support as needed , allowing him to maximize the power under his command . 
  training among coalition nations identifies problems of integration and allows time for improvement . 
  training also helps in coordinating tactics among separate nations with different capabilities and doctrine . 
    for a coalition to be unified , its members must agree . 
  elements of a successful coalition include unified objectives , planning , command and control , and combined arms operations . 
  these elements create unity of purpose , for which a coalition is formed . 
  abda was never able to agree on strategy until it agreed the nei was lost . 
  future coalitions must have their house unified before they can meet the threat at the door . 
  nah , the rooskies already got the moniker with the [ ilyushin il-2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilyushin_il-2 ) . 
  honestly , it might be a nice gesture to give it back . 
  we could build a tall ship ourselves , and they tend to be `` symbols '' -- if you hang onto them the way [ the brits do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hms_victory ) and [ the way we do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_constitution ) , it 'd be classier to have one you made yourself , i think . 
  < shrug  it 's not just americans and britons that speak english in the world . 
  it 's true that no one state in the us is as relatively-large as germany is in the eu , but the difference between the us and the eu here is not that large . 
  germany is 15.9 % of the eu 's population . 
  california is 12.1 % . 
  i think that you 're selling / u/lolmonger short here . 
  i also think that a lot of the nato and other coordination work was because there was a point in time when we * had n't * been very well-coordinated , and it turned into an unbelievable clusterfuck when we threw together an emergency patchwork force . 
  [ abdacom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american-british-dutch-australian_command ) in world war ii was a holding force thrown together consisting of all the american , british , dutch , and australian forces that could be pieced together in short order to fight a holding action against the japanese . 
  its big moment was the [ battle of the java sea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_java_sea ) , under dutch command , which was a catastrophe for the allied side -- while numerically , our combined forces were roughly comparable to the japanese forces available , they simply did n't operate well as a unit due to lack of practice coordinating and were annihilated . 
  that sort of thing is n't going to happen again . 
  the [ battle of crete ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_crete ) did n't work out well either , nor [ operation market garden ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_market_garden ) on the allied side . 
  d-day did use airborne troops without catastrophe ... however , i think that a lot of people were excited by the idea of airborne troops as a way to break the stalemates of world war i , and they just did n't quite live up to expectation . 
  but nobody actually * says * that . 
  you mean the you kay ? 
   given the fact we still get called czechoslovakia to this day that 's because `` czech republic '' was even more awkward to say .

  not that i think that turkey lied about this , but really i do n't see the connection . 
  that was n't turkey . 
   companies and organisations will be obliged to inform national supervisory bodies of serious data breaches so that users can take appropriate measures . 
  i do like that -- that helps establish a reputation for security , too , if there 's visibility into breaches . 
   in comments made to reuters prior to the incident and published on thursday , poland 's deputy defense minister said that nato should return to cold war ways of thinking in its relations with russia , and speak to moscow from a position of strength to counter its renewed assertiveness in eastern europe . 
  hmm . 
  nato 's in a pretty strong position . 
  so , let 's say that nato becomes more aggressive . 
  what does it buy ? 
  it seems to me that it makes it politically-harder for the russian administration to leave ukraine , [ which is what we 'd like to see happen ] ( http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/03/254750.htm ) : they 'd lose more face in doing so . 
   accepting the benefits provided by the entire eu but filtering the disadvantages based on country is not a morally correct position , but definitely in canada 's advantage . 
  afaik , canada does n't insist on visa-free access from canada to romania as a condition , right ? 
   but the issue is not as technical as canada wants to present it . 
  it is also very much a political issue . 
  why would canada have a reason other than concerns over legitimate problems that would be caught by visa rejections for not using visa waivers ? 
  it 's not as if canada benefits by having to pay people to review visas . 
  eh , i could see the eu establishing a passport-issuing bloc without federalizing and that being sufficient . 
   also , you have to keep in mind about which kind of employees/office you are talking about , these are pretty much the same people who renewed visa for mohamed atta a number of months after he flew into wtc at 9/11 . 
  no country will have a perfect rate of rejecting all potential-problem visas -- but neither can it be expected to do so , since that would set the visa reject rate to overwhelming levels . 
  but is saying `` your immigration services did not catch all problems '' grounds for saying `` there is no point in having a filter '' ? 
  i think that that 's an unrealistic bar . 
  there 's an expectation that there will be some visa rejects that would n't have actually been a problem and some visa accepts that wind up being a problem , same as any other country 's immigration system . 
  that 's [ in-line with the paper that i posted earlier on international law and us navy being able to initiate use of force ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4en89r/video_of_russian_su24_buzzing_uss_donald_cook_in/d22816t ) . 
  the same paper also pointed out , though , that while it might have been in line with the rules of engagement , it is also probably a good idea to hold off as much as possible . 
  some people have proposed it , and it 's an interesting idea . 
  if what you want to retain is * forcing * generation n +1 to pay for generation n 's retirement ( instead of just hoping that they 're willing to do it ) , and you do n't mind some people having a lower standard of living in their retirement than others , it 's an interesting knob to play with . 
  it does have some obvious potential issues . 
  * a man can have a lot more children than a woman can . 
  * while there are ways that one could adjust the policy , a naive implementation would penalize the barren , which might be seen as unacceptable . 
  * it might be that the broader issue is that it 's expensive in time to raise children in the traditional fashion , and we 'd be better-served by trying to make that more-efficient . 
  * some people would say that the best answer * is n't * to have more children -- either that increasing immigration or simply reducing population is fine . 
  reduce the old-age standard of living or make people work longer to make up any difference . 
  * the `` traditional '' children-pay-for-their-own-parents model encouraged parents to try and get their children to care about them . 
  if you simply get a score for having n children and there 's no incentive to raise them , it might have a dramatic effect on society . 
  if you tie it to * having * children , you will have a lot of children put up for adoption . 
  if you tie it to * rearing * children , you might have children who live in rather-unpleasant conditions , as all they represent is a notch on a pension checklist for their parents . 
  but i agree that that 's an interesting route to examine -- just that it seems to me that there are some pitfalls to avoid . 
  the real value of whatever portion of the money supply comes by dividing the real value of the existing money supply among a larger pool . 
  you * can * keep expanding the supply , but you keep pulling from a smaller pool , and at some point ( like zimbabwe during hyperinflation ) , your ability to extract wealth from people holding your currency hits very little as very few people store any form of wealth in your currency . 
  basically , expanding the money supply a given amount winds up having a smaller and smaller effect . 
  not saying that there 's no correlation , but there are some strong counterexamples . 
  [ lesotho has 42.9 % of its gdp going to government revenues , one of the highest in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_gdp ) , and a [ tfr of 3.04 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/lesotho/fertility-rate-total-births-per-woman-wb-data.html ) . 
  the united arab emirates have 1.4 % of gdp going to government revenue -- the lowest in the world -- and [ a tfr of only 1.86 between 2005 and 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_united_arab_emirates ) . 
  ` course , that 's not holding all else equal , since the two countries do differ in many ways . 
   the economy sucks . 
  the modern standard of living is a lot higher than what people would have enjoyed not-that-many generations ago ; we 're all better-off in that sense . 
  and there are plenty of much-poorer-than-europe countries that successfully maintain population . 
  i have a terribly-difficult time seeing a referendum on british membership in the eu as not being relevant-to-all-of-europe news .
