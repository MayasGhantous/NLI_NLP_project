  my point was n't to advocate making a replica , but that these were comparatively-isolated , but still had the appeal . 
  you did n't need a whole country of farms using horses to get around and using manual pumps to draw water to provide that attraction for people who wanted to enjoy said farms . 
   also china made some , i think trade contracts , with ukraine , while war in eastern ua was at it highest . 
  showing to russia yet another middle finger . 
  i doubt very much that china will become involved in the dispute on either side , including in opposition to russia . 
  there 's no benefit to china in doing so . 
   when pressed too hard by the west , russia has no choice but to enter into an alliance with china . 
  it 's not really russia 's choice . 
  russia would , no doubt , be ecstatic if china announced an alliance with russia tomorrow as regards the ukraine issue . 
  china 's the one who would turn down russia . 
  ( numbers from slightly-different years and sources , but they make the point ) [ eu 's top trading partners ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7224419/6-31032016-bp-en.pdf ) : * us ( $ 619 bn , or 18 % of total eu trade in goods ) * china ( $ 521 bn , or 15 % ) * [ ... ] * russia ( $ 210 bn , or 6 % ) [ us 's top trading partners ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_united_states ) : * eu ( $ 694b ) * canada ( $ 660b ) * china ( $ 590b ) * [ ... ] * ( russia not in top 25 top us trading partners ) [ china 's top trading partners ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_china ) : * eu ( $ 567b ) * us ( $ 446b ) * [ ... ] * russia ( $ 79.2 b ) of the three , the one for which trade and relations with russia have the most weight is the eu . 
  also , for good measure , the [ top trading partners of russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_russia ) ( unfortunately , without combining the eu or combining imports and exports ) . 
  the eu is overwhelmingly important to russia . 
  okay , but why * us * corporations ? 
  like , what makes the canadian [ agrium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agrium ) not frightening but the us [ cf industries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cf_industries ) alarming ? 
  they 're both selling fertilizer to you , they both represent competition in the fertilizer field , and you can compete with both in their respective countries . 
   i mean how many americans can name one big thing she did in her career ? 
  well , the same is true of senators and so forth too . 
  but it does get her name out there in the news , provides recognition . 
  probably of all the cabinet officials , the secretary of state would get the most press time . 
  maybe secretary of defense during wartime would get more . 
   anyway , point is that boris johnsons career is now pretty much over . 
  fair-enough -- just wanted to say that i did n't feel that the generalization held for all countries . 
   is it worth giving up one of the most beautiful , iconic regions of the world to increase farming efficiency ? 
  well , let me put it this way -- how many tourists come to look at farms , and how many farms do they require ? 
  i mean , we 've got things to cater to tourism too -- [ dude ranches ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guest_ranch ) and [ guest time at farms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agritourism#united_states ) is a thing over here . 
  not my cup of tea , but i had a buddy who worked at an organic farm for a summer for the hell of it , get back in touch with his pastoral side or something . 
  did n't do it for money , but for the experience . 
  if you want to see one , you can find it . 
  but how much of the country 's industry do you need to fix in place to retain a sort of museum experience ? 
  i mean ... sure , there are natives in various countries who will do traditional stuff for tourists . 
  but if you want to freeze the whole country in time just for tourist appeal , it seems like overkill . 
  if i want to see [ traditional irish dances ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgi_jb0qkuw ) , i can see it ... but surely there 's no harm in most of the country moving on to making television shows and whatnot , even if tourists wo n't come to see that happening . 
   it 's at about 5 % eu wide , with italy and france being notable standouts at 12 % and 11 % respectively . 
  no , but the eu ( a ) is a net food importer , unlike the us and ( b ) also is n't producing as much bulk commodity food as the us is , as much mass . 
  the us exports more-heavily in efficiently-produced simple things , like grains . 
  the eu tends to export higher-value goods , like wine . 
   whel idealy wou do n't want to import anything . 
  but since eu countries are not selfseficiant on their own the need other eu countrie . 
  now eu is selfseficiant on its own in most things and therforts is able to not import . 
  only export . 
  the idea that what you want to do is to block imports and maximize exports and stockpile money ( well , it was gold then ) is called [ mercantilism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ) , and it 's not been economic consensus in europe for three hundred years . 
  i think that the reason for its popularity might be because it models what a responsible individual might do , because that individual should save assets for retirement , and people say `` hey , a country should do that '' . 
  but countries do n't retire -- they just keep on going . 
  it does n't buy a country anything to just sit on a heap of gold . 
  if it does so , it just drives domestic wages and prices way up until it ca n't export any more , then lives worse-off than it would if it were able to engage in free trade , since it ca n't leverage comparative advantage . 
  that country wants to * use * those assets , to have them act as capital , to produce something worthwhile . 
  [ milton friedman gave a speech once ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_fxt0em ) that i like linking on here . 
  i think that it 's relevant , as it covers both concerns about steel imports ( though he was talking to a bunch of people in the us in the 1970s about the same topic , when our steel production began to decline ) , and why one would not want to block imports in a rather nice , compact way . 
   lowe quality steal ower the production of wich you also have no control and in time of war would be left out . 
  national security over strategic resources is a valid concern -- if the eu does n't want china to be able to cut off its steel supply , it needs to have enough domestic or reliable alternate sources . 
  however : * such a requirement does not mean that no steel production can be reduced . 
  the eu is currently producing [ the second-most-steel of any unit in the world , over twice as much as the us is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_steel_production ) . 
  how much steel does the eu need to go to war ? 
  * one does n't need to actively maintain steel production to have the ability to scale up if need be . 
  * there are numerous other limitations that i think would more-greatly inhibit the eu 's ability to go to war with china . 
  * i 'd say that it 's doubtful that a modern war would involve a great deal of steel production over time . 
  even in a non-nuclear war involving a fight for survival between the major powers ... modern industrial infrastructure relies on power production . 
  planes have huge range today . 
  one side would very likely gain air superiority , and wipe out the other side 's power plants as an early target , as the us has done when it has gone to war in recent years . 
  [ in the korean war ] ( http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/how-korean-war-almost-went-nuclear-180955324/?no-ist ) : `` by the time we left , there was n't any electricity in north korea . '' . 
  in the [ vietnam war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_rolling_thunder ) : '' ... thermal and electrical power plants , ship and rail repair facilities , and warehouses ... '' in the [ gulf war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulf_war_air_campaign ) : `` coalition bombing raids destroyed iraqi civilian infrastructure . 
  11 of iraq 's 20 major power stations and 119 substations were totally destroyed , while a further six major power stations were damaged . 
  [ 18 ] [ 19 ] at the end of the war , electricity production was at four percent of its pre-war levels . '', 
  in world war ii , production was important ( particularly to the us ) because there was limited power projection capacity in that era and one side was under-armed and could hold off attacks but had strong industrial capacity . 
  honestly , i doubt that most modern nations could even maintain the food supply without electricity . 
   for a concerned cityzen who has studied history there is no gain in letting foreighners contorl your primary sector production . 
  if you 're trading with the other country , you do establish some dependence upon them . 
  however , this is not a unilateral relationship -- they in turn also acquire dependence upon you . 
   actualy usualy the owner will belled the cmpany dry and steal everething that can be stolen . 
  i do n't see why ( a ) someone who owned a profitable company would have an interest in disemboweling it or ( b ) why a free trade agreement would particularly encourage embezzlement . 
   yeah , because administrators need even more money . 
  why would an administrator require a larger share of money if trade were available ? 
  let 's say that you 're supervising ten people . 
  their wages are set by supply and demand , just as with anyone else 's . 
  in some industry that decreases in size , their wages can be expected to decrease until a sufficient number of people leave , and in some industry that increases in size , their wages can be expected to increase until a sufficient number of people enter . 
  someone who has people report to him is not different in this respect than someone who does n't . 
   some conpanies take out loans to pay dividends . 
  thihis is right out stupid . 
  i mean ... whether it is or not , i do n't see why free trade would encourage ( or discourage ) taking out loans to pay dividends . 
   the case of denationalization of slovenias asets and joining the eu . 
  okay , so just so i get you straight ... you 're saying that when slovenia joined the eu and privatized industry ( a ) administrators made more money , ( b ) owners of companies stole money from the company , ( c ) that companies took out loans to pay dividends , and that because of this happening , you do n't want the eu to sign free trade agreements , as it might lead to that happening again . 
  is that more-or-less your concern ? 
   that such a law is not in the interest of the people . 
  well , let me put it this way . 
  if i pass a law against , oh , murder , that law is probably not in the interest of ( at least most ) murderers , since it means that they wind up in prison . 
  by your criteria , that would make it not in the interest of the people . 
  surely you 'd agree that that criteria is too-strict , that it would block laws that are in the interest of the public ? 
   for every one rich person there are at least 1000 poor . 
  do you want more of that ? 
  well , it depends what you mean by `` rich '' and `` poor '' in this context . 
  north korea has probably the least amount of international trade of any country in the world , and it has a population that is extremely poor in absolute terms -- with a ppp per-capita gdp of $ 1,800 , it is [ 180 out of 192 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) . 
  looking online at various resources , singapore probably is the country that is probably the most open to international trade . 
  its ppp per-capita gdp of $ 85,700 is the fourth-highest in the world . 
  on the other hand , if you care about relative terms ... while north korea does n't provide enough data to provide income inequality information , slovenia currently has the [ wealthiest 10 % of society having an average income that is 5.9 times the income of the poorest 10 % of society ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) . 
  ( for comparison , the us is 15.9 , and the uk 13.8 ) . 
  in singapore , it 's 17.7 . 
  so at least for that country , it 's true that the wealthier are better off relative to the poorer , if you simply are interested in that ratio . 
   exactly , do we need more people out of their job ? 
  well , if it means that on the net , more people who would n't have a job now have them in other industries , it seems reasonable .
