   eletrycety is at an all time low . 
  it is so ceep in fact as is that our eletrycety producers find it hard to conpeet . 
  that 's going to be a function of their profit margin -- the difference between their costs and their revenue . 
  this will reduce those costs . 
  they make more money for a bit , then competition pushes down prices to the consumer , so revenue falls . 
  but the consumer winds up being able to purchase more electricity for each euro -- he 's now `` paid '' in more electricity . 
    the eu is a major exporter of machinery , vehicles , aircraft , plastics , and pharmaceuticals , among other things , so those industries will tend to be hiring up more people and wages will tend to rise for workers in those industries . 
    those industries do n't need coal miners with elementary school , they need farmaceuts with universety education some of them will . 
  some of them wo n't . 
  there 's labor in all of the above fields -- i suspect that the first four are more-significant -- that will require lower-education labor . 
  however ... if the concern is that demand will shift more towards high-education labor , i think that that 's probably pretty much inevitable , regardless of whether-or-not free trade happens : we 're simply better at automating low-education jobs at the moment , so that will cause more people to become more-highly educated . 
  and that has happened : go back a hundred-and-fifty years , and the average years of education was much-lower over here . 
  or ... let me put it this way . 
  the us signed a major free trade agreement with mexico and canada , nafta , in 1994 . 
  ( that mostly brought less-educated labor access to the us due to mexico , so it could be expected to produce more pressure on low-educated wages than ttip or ceta would for the eu ) . 
  here 's the [ average earnings based on education ] ( https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/cps/historical/fig10.jpg ) . 
  the most-highly-educated ( masters-degree-and-above ) have tended to do better in the us -- instead of making about 2.1-ish what people with a high school degree do , as in 1975 , they now make maybe 2.7-ish . 
  but the relative increase was n't mostly in 1994 , but in the decade or so before it . 
  it 's been comparatively-flat since then , in fact . 
  i screwed up on two points . 
  first , it 's not `` foreign minister '' ... and * technically * , the title of the office in the uk is the [ secretary of state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretary_of_state_for_foreign_and_commonwealth_affairs ) , even if it 's not what anyone uses . 
  huh . 
  how about miliband ? 
  well , that 's certainly the argument that corbyn 's supporters have made . 
  my own view is that in a fptp system , moving away from the center is a really bad idea , and that arguments about sacrificing the short term and trying to use the prominence that party control gives to build internal political momentum in the uk are very dubious . 
  there are lots of things i do n't agree with the tory-heavy / r/ukpolitics on , but i think that their assessment of corbyn as unlikely to accomplish anything useful for labour is probably accurate ( though they 're pretty jubilant about it ) . 
  of course , we 'll see -- the proof is in the pudding , and certainly it looks like labour 's mps are n't going to be able to kick him out in the near term , so he 'll have more time to try to establish his movement . 
  well ... i mean , is the question rhetorical ? 
  certainly she 'd have a harder time if she were facing a stronger opponent . 
  i doubt that in a typical election , she 'd manage to win in the general election , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  both candidates are unusually unpopular this time . 
  well , let me put it this way . 
  would you want to permanently keep a substantial amount of the eu 's resources tied up in small-scale farming , even if it costs people in the eu in terms of standard of living ? 
  southern and eastern europe today are [ not very urbanized ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:2015_world_urbanization_map.png ) compared to northern europe and the us . 
  that 's a process that is [ almost universally happening around the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization ) , and [ took about a hundred years over here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urbanization_in_the_united_states ) for most of the country -- people tend to leave villages , and cities become larger . 
  fewer people are involved with mining and farming and more people become involved in manufacturing and services . 
  when the us formed , from memory , about 70 % of the population was involved in agriculture . 
  now it 's down to [ about 4 % of the male population ( about 2-3 % overall ) and we still export vast amounts of food ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/labor/agricultural-workers/male ) . 
  i do n't believe that that process will stop -- i think that agriculture will invariably tend to shift towards a greater degree of automation , as internally within the eu , larger and less-labor-intensive producers will make greater returns . 
  it 's true that perhaps blocking trade agreements might slow it , but i have a hard time seeing it stay that way . 
  i am no farmer -- i work with bits and bytes . 
  but if you go back a few generations and look at my family on both sides , there 's a fair number of farmers . 
  at some point , they all sold out and went off to do something else . 
  i do n't look back and say `` gosh , i wish that somehow they were prevented from doing so '' . 
  perhaps they felt a sense of loss when leaving the farm , but it did n't propagate over time . 
   better to not export than to export at the price of importing . 
  why is that ? 
  and if that is the case , why does the same argument not apply at a smaller scale -- that is , why is it good that a slovenian may export to slovakia and receive slovakian imports versus a slovenian having to buy only slovenian products ? 
   not if i have to close steal mils because of cheep chines steal . 
  well , we 've [ shut down about half of our steel production ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=ussteel&amp;v=201610251719q&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) . 
  but by doing so , it means that we can use that newly-available less-expensive steel to build more bridges , skyscrapers , and automobiles . 
  why do you specifically not want steel production to decrease ? 
  i mean , for someone who constructs bridges ( or wants to use those bridges ) , this is a gain . 
   most individuals , the only gains go to companies . 
  i 'm not ... exactly sure what you mean by this , though i 'm fairly sure that i do n't agree . 
  you mean that a company will tend to hold cash as a result of this and not invest it ? 
  that the wages of administrators will tend to rise ? 
  that shareholders will tend to receive higher dividends ? 
  i do n't believe that there 's any particular connection between trade being available and these happening . 
  do you have a particular source that you 're referring to . 
   if not everione can benifit , than noone will . 
  i think that that 's probably an unrealistically high bar -- any policy , any law , almost anything will be disadvantageous to some and advantageous to others . 
  if the rule is `` things stay the same unless every person is net better-off '' , you 'd have an effectively paralyzed government ... even though the * aggregate * of those changes might be quite positive for essentially everyone . 
   for monsanto , how about john smith a coal mines ? 
  i would guess that coal will tend to decline in production in the eu if ceta passes ; canada apparently is a coal exporter , and the eu is a coal importer ; anything that reduces barriers will tend to increase that effect . 
  looking at a graph , the eu has long seen declines in coal mining . 
  the flip side of that is that it means that europeans will wind up with less-expensive energy . 
  but i think that what you 're getting at is more `` poor people will wind up worse off '' , which is n't an intrinsic property of trade . 
  i 'm guessing that you 're thinking of coal because it 's a particular industry that 's been in decline for a long time , so you 're thinking of coal miners being out of work . 
  the eu is a major exporter of machinery , vehicles , aircraft , plastics , and pharmaceuticals , among other things , so those industries will tend to be hiring up more people and wages will tend to rise for workers in those industries . 
   ceta , as has been advertised , is very broad , much broader than other fta 's . 
  none of the arguments seem to depend on scale , though . 
   and really , why ca n't people change their mind ? 
  well , they can change their mind . 
  maybe they were n't aware of them before , or maybe their opinion changed . 
  but that does make one wonder why : * the objection is to ceta and/or ttip and not to cancel existing ftas containing isds . 
  * there 's been a lack of issues causing popular concern over isds in existing ftas in the years that the eu has had these . 
  he 's still not able to command the support of the * electorate * . 
  what you see in the uk today is a collection of activists taking control of a political party , and because it lacks popular support , effectively neutering it . 
  ermngh . 
  that would be a hard question to answer . 
  a much larger question is what trump actually wants to do -- he kinda ping-pongs all over thee place , and has suggested a number of incompatible approaches . 
  my strong suspicion is that in practice , the bureaucracy would actually determine what happens , as is the norm , and that they 'd respond . 
  however , if you assume that he did act independently ... 
  normally , a president does most foreign policy . 
  in particular , he can do almost whatever he wants in the short term , since the executive is seen as appropriate for rapid response : not sending troops in response to an attack would almost certainly be under his control . 
  normally , congress is involved in approving treaties that the executive produces , and takes only a general hand . 
  i ca n't think of a case where congress forced foreign action when the executive did n't want it . 
  usually , things are the opposite : the executive wants to do something and congress might try to block it . 
  for example , the [ neutrality acts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neutrality_acts_of_1930s ) involved congress passing a number of laws to block fdr from bringing us into world war ii ( after pearl harbor , they agreed to war ) . 
  congress has a lot of indirect clout , since it can make statements or bargain with other things , and it controls the budget -- if a president does n't do what congress wants , they can not give him money for it . 
  but in terms of direct ability to do something , it would be really hard to make a dead-set-against-it president send troops anywhere . 
  in fact , after vietnam , congress passed the [ war powers act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_powers_resolution ) , which blocks a president from long-term commitment of forces without their approval . 
  it 's not clear that this is constitutional , that it may violate separation of powers . 
  http://fpc.state.gov/6172.htm i think that the main mechanisms that would be truly binding would be : * if it turned out that trump were guilty of treason -- for example , taking a bribe from an enemy to not respond -- he could be impeached and removed from office . 
  this would probably not be a fast process in the real world . 
  however , he has no direct way to block this process . 
  * a two-thirds supermajority in both the house and senate could override a presidential veto . 
  i do n't know how far a legislative directive to the president could go or how realistic it could be to enforce over any intentional executive heel-dragging . 
  * finally , there 's the nuclear option .
