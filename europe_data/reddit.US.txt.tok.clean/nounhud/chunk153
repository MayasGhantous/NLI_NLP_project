  the states can do whatever they want via amending the constitution , including completely eliminating the president 's office . 
  this requires either two-thirds of the senate and house or two-thirds of the state legislatures to initiate . 
  to approve , three-fourths of the states must ratify . 
  the executive has no control over this process . 
   he also has to suck up to foreigners which is not popular at home , that holds for any country , not just uk . 
  our next president is gon na be our former secretary of state , which is equivalent to one of your foreign ministers . 
   it is quite easy to fake screenshots , pdf documents , and other files , but faking email inboxes is quite difficult . 
  oh , come on . 
  i will happily buy that they 're real , but this is the stupidest argument ever . 
  the us originally had family farms too . 
  over time , those [ have combined into larger operations ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/16/the-decline-of-the-small-american-family-farm-in-one-chart/ ) . 
  yes to both of these statements . 
  / u/executivemonkey is making a joke , as is his wont . 
  http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/international-migration/glossary/poverty/  frequently , poverty is defined in either relative or absolute terms . 
  absolute poverty measures poverty in relation to the amount of money necessary to meet basic needs such as food , clothing , and shelter . 
  the concept of absolute poverty is not concerned with broader quality of life issues or with the overall level of inequality in society . 
  the concept therefore fails to recognise that individuals have important social and cultural needs . 
  this , and similar criticisms , led to the development of the concept of relative poverty . 
  relative poverty defines poverty in relation to the economic status of other members of the society : people are poor if they fall below prevailing standards of living in a given societal context . 
  an important criticism of both concepts is that they are largely concerned with income and consumption . 
  which one ? 
   the walloons want to see loopholes closed that they say would allow u.s. multinationals with offices in canada to use the treaty to sue governments in europe , says osgoode hall law professor gus van harten . 
  why , exactly , are * us * multinationals a specific concern ? 
   in all probability , it will take decades of increased exposure before the outside world starts to understand ukraine without viewing the country through a russian prism . 
  ukraine is a country of 42 million . 
  surely there are a few journalists somewhere among its population who are objective and could be hired to write reports on happenings , or could work in collaboration with foreign journalists ? 
  i mean , come on -- this should not be a new problem for international journalism . 
   as more jobs are automated , masses of unskilled and largely uneducated immigrants will become a liability . 
  yeah , but the us immigration policy is based on skilled immigration . 
   the center-left is dying because genuine leftists see that they have given up even the pretense of opposition to neoliberal economics . 
  that is why corbyn is crushing all the blairites . 
  corbyn is n't very popular among the electorate , which is what matters . 
  the labour party happened to change their rules in a way that was vulnerable to activist groups seizing control of the party . 
  this permitted people who were willing to pay a small amount to determine the makeup of the party . 
  a left-wing group did so , seized control of the party , and now it 's doomed to political ineffectualness . 
  that 's not an endorsement for a left position -- it 's an issue with the party 's internal rules . 
  what definition of `` poverty '' are you using ? 
  for crying out loud . 
  i mean , i do n't see why the nato agreement could n't be revised to include them if it 's a real concern . 
  i do n't really think that spain sees them as threatened , though . 
  japan [ is in free trade agreements with a much greater dollar value of economies than the eu is in ] ( http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/fta/ ) . 
    trade benefits all parties involved and creates a higher standard of living . 
    not neceseraly , trade can also result in the distruction of local industy , los of jobs ect . 
  those are not incompatible . 
  any change in economic pressures -- a new invention , discovering a new vast deposit of coal and mining it , a free trade agreement -- will alter demand . 
  as demand changes , the companies that served that previous demand will go out of business and people who worked in them previously be laid off . 
  ( well , or a company might downsize and just lay people off or internally retrain , but in practice `` going out of business '' is correct ) . 
  however , there will also be new business and expansion of businesses that export . 
  you do get the following promise : for each dollar imported , in the long run , you 're also exporting a dollar . 
  what 's more , because of [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) , both parties will wind up better-off overall . 
  true , some individuals will almost certainly wind up worse-off . 
  not all ships will rise evenly , and some will go down . 
  the only guarantee is that on the net , it will be a win . 
  if the country in question wants to smooth that out and spread benefits around internally , that 's up to it , an internal question . 
  you ca n't have a customs union and let individual members negotiate their own trade agreements with the outside world . 
  a customs union is a fta internally and a single set of rules externally . 
  if you tried that , everyone would just have the lowest tariffs of any member . 
  the problem is that while the eu has much better trade internally than europe once did , every additional member in a veto-based system raises the bar to signing * external * trade deals . 
  what i 'd say the eu needs is a majority vote on trade deals . 
  that 's the standard that individual countries in the eu once met . 
  it retains the same bar , instead of raising it higher and higher . 
  you did need some degree of that knowledge , because you had to judge the trustworthiness of two opposing groups . 
  if there was consensus on the effects , then you 'd just have to go out , read about them , and make your call . 
  the `` everyone '' bit is because all the voters had to make that call . 
  it might be that europe * is n't * the optimal place to do food production if it does n't have gobs of cheap land . 
  if that 's true , you 'll see less-land-intensive things like manufacturing ramp up in europe and export to canada and farming ramp down , with canada doing the opposite . 
  i think that those same people should explain why they 're fine with the existing eu ftas with isds , but not one with canada or the us . 
  can you be more-specific ? 
  in what ways do you prefer the fta with south korea to ttip ? 
  if you subsidize inefficient industries , you 're doing it by weakening stronger industries that you have that * are * globally-competitive . 
  we managed [ to do it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continental_congress ) . 
   under the articles of confederation , the confederation congress had little power to compel the individual states to comply with any of its decisions . 
  more and more prospective delegates elected to the confederation congress declined to serve in it . 
  [ constitutional convention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitutional_convention_\\ ( united_states \\ ) )  it soon became evident to nearly all that the underfunded confederation government , as originally organized , was inadequate for managing the various conflicts that arose among the states . 
  [ 5 ] :4 -- 5 [ 6 ] :14 -- 16 as the articles of confederation could only be amended by unanimous vote of the states , any state had effective veto power over any proposed change . 
  [ 7 ] in addition , the articles gave the weak federal government no taxing power : it was wholly dependent on the states for its money , and had no power to force delinquent states to pay . 
  [ 7 ] just saying . 
  no , but obviously that could be an issue with 28 constitutions that could retroactively kill agreements . 
  edit : well , 27 ... the uk does n't have one . 
  hmm . 
  i 'd say that canada correctly said `` this is an internal eu issue '' -- i was actually surprised to see canada and tusk and wallonia meet . 
  if the eu agrees to something , it 's up to the individual members to do their horsetrading to figure out how much to extract from each other in exchange for buying that non-veto . 
  according to wikipedia , you guys did the [ same thing in south africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wagon_fort#overview ) in the form of `` laagers '' :  the laager was put to the ultimate test on 16 december 1838 , when an army of 10 000 zulu impi 's besieged and were defeated by approximately 350 voortrekkers in the aptly named battle of blood river . 
   i would say it fosters a sense of community , with nothing drawing people to town centres a town just becomes somewhere to sleep . 
  aka [ a commuter town ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commuter_town ) or `` bedroom community '' as they call it over here . 
  i doubt that they 'll show up unless you have very high rates of car ownership -- a car makes it easier to do shopping a long distance away . 
  i * could * believe that the offices that someone works in becomes disconnected from where the home is . 
  hmm . 
  could you be more-specific as to the model ? 
  wikipedia lists [ several subs that have holding tanks of liquid oxygen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air-independent_propulsion ) , but i do n't see anything that could do anything like eight weeks at speed . 
  the german 212-class can do three weeks if it reduces it speed , for example . 
  wikipedia says that the only dutch sub in service is the * walrus * - class , which does n't appear to have the ability to run engines off bottled oxygen . 
  the * walrus * - class do n't appear to have anything like that sort of submerged endurance : http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/30/dutch_sub_fights_somali_pirates/  holland 's * walrus * - class submarines use diesel-electric propulsion rather than the nuclear powerplants universal in the us and british submarine fleets . 
  this means that when fully submerged they must run on battery power , reducing them to a crawl ( a short sprint at speeds approaching those of merchant shipping can be managed , but this will drain the batteries in half an hour or less ) . 
  in order to move faster than a few knots , such a sub must come to the surface : though batteries can be recharged moving a little faster at periscope depth by the use of a `` snorkel '' or `` snort '' air-intake mast to run the diesels underwater . 
  cost . 
  the brits made the same call on their new carriers . 
  it 's not cheap to build nuclear vessels . 
  with subs , diesel is a * huge * disadvantage , because you need air for the combustion engines to charge batteries . 
  that means surfacing and being vulnerable and detectable .
