  in a us navy submarine , once you go down , you 're probably not seeing sky for six months . 
  with aircraft carriers , it just means that you have less power available and have to have tankers replenishing them . 
  i imagine that it means less space for aircraft , too . 
  drawback , but not as bad as with subs . 
  first they take our 1950s god-and-country-no-homos-you-damn-atheists schtick . 
  then they 've got that night wolves motorcycle gang going around on harleys and running rock-n-roll clubs . 
  and they had themselves portrayed as a bear wearing blue jeans ... and now the us navy . 
  no more cultural appropriation , dammit !, 
  well ... they 're correct in the us standard for common use . 
  not normally in british everyday use , even if it 's permitted . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_american_and_british_english https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_and_british_english_spelling_differences https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oxford_spelling  oxford spelling ( also oxford english dictionary spelling or oxford english spelling [ 1 ] ) is the spelling standard used by the oxford university press ( oup ) for british publications , including its oxford english dictionary ( oed ) and its influential british style guide hart 's rules , and by other publishers who are `` etymology conscious '' , according to merriam-webster . 
  [ 2 ]   oxford spelling is best known for its preference for the suffix - ize in words like organize and recognize , versus the - ise endings that are more common in current british english usage . 
  [ 3 ] the spelling affects about 200 verbs and is favoured because - ize corresponds more closely to the greek root , - izo , of most - ize verbs . 
  [ 4 ] in addition to the oup 's `` oxford '' - branded dictionaries , other british dictionary publishers that list - ize suffixes first include cassell , collins and longman . 
  [ 5 ] oxford spelling is used by many british academic/science journals ( for example , nature ) and many international organizations ( for example , the united nations ) . 
  it is common for academic , formal , and technical writing for an international readership ( see usage ) . 
  in digital documents , oxford spelling may be indicated by the ietf language tag en-gb-oxendict ( or , historically , by en-gb-oed ) . 
  this sort of position came off as utterly senseless to me as well , particularly since most of these are happy with the benefits of trade in the single market now that it 's in place . 
  i asked a left-winger on here and he explained his reasoning , which at least helps one see the rationale . 
  he wanted the eu to have high guarantees of workers rights . 
  that and the transfer payments for agriculture and so forth kind of let me see what the left is wanting . 
  there are jobs today that are artificially-highly-paid , as on farms . 
  these are often relatively-poor people . 
  so his goal was to block people who work in globally-competitive fields in the eu , like manufacturing cars or software or whatever , from having access to market rate agriculture , and have those subsidize his favored field . 
  from his standpoint , the eu is a captive market that must buy his goods . 
  now , from my viewpoint , there 's a lot wrong with this . 
  it supports blocking every economic change ever -- when demand for automobiles started replacing demand for saddles , wages for saddlemakers would have dropped until only the most die-hard remained in the field . 
  and that 's a good thing , as it is the way that the market reallocates labor and other resources to where they are needed . 
  the world today can produce food far more-cheaply with large-scale , mechanized agriculture ... so it * should * take advantage of that . 
  that 's the process via which we wind up raising the standard of living in society ... if we did n't , we 'd all be in a medieval world , with meat maybe once a month . 
  second , my view is that welfare should be disconnected from industry . 
  if you 're poorly-paid , and the state wants to produce a more-egalitarian spread of income , any subsidies it provides you should be disconnected from your particular industry , since the * real * thing that matters is income . 
  it should n't be because your industry happens to be politically-connected . 
  third , in an fta , the things that put the most pressure on low-skill wages would be ftas with poorer countries . 
  the eu has ftas with much of africa and with mexico ... but not with canada or the us , which seems like a strange position to take . 
  you mean that canada is in a fta with the us and would be with the eu ? 
  if that 's a concern , that 's already been done in the form of mexico . 
  there are a lot of conflicting workflows out there . 
  i once read [ this ] ( http://www.zompist.com/amercult.html ) -- which is now well out-of-date -- and realized that while type of packaging is consistent within a country , it often varies a lot between countries . 
  has inertia once established . 
  i mean , on any given policy topic , i usually would n't know enough to pick up on someone knowledgeable about it lying either . 
  you ca n't reasonably expect the whole society to acquire expert-level knowledge in all policy areas . 
  with a short campaign , with both sides claiming that the other side is lying , it comes down to how easily someone can evaluate the truthfulness of two sets of competing claims based on what is probably a relatively-brief and incomplete evaluation of their arguments . 
  should have made the point that the british voter did n't like this level of immigration , since that was what wound up mattering . 
  it sure did n't go how cameron planned . 
  i wonder if the sun and friends would print them if someone mailed in the corrections after each issue with errors . 
   there were 15 shop closures a day across the uk in the first half of 2016 ... 
  note that thus was pre-brexit ( also , that this is not a net number and does n't have a yoy comparison ) . 
  english has more speakers than spanish internationally . 
  spanish has more first-language speakers internationally , thoufh, 
  hmm . 
  do communist belgians actually want an fta with russia ? 
  you already have an fta with mexico . 
  any fears you have about transitive relationships with free other members in an fta should have already manifested themselves . 
  he said `` russia '' , not `` all russians '' . 
  this was the russian embassy in the uk , which acts as the official representative of the russian state . 
  i do n't really understand the goal in sending it out . 
  it might be to try to encourage the uk to think more-negatively of the eurozone , but they have to know that more people than britons will monitor this . 
  it might be something subtle that i do n't understand , like to intentionally provoke a backlash ( though i ca n't understand how that would benefit russia ... maybe to portray europe as aggressors ? ) . 
  or it could just be that the embassy does n't really give a damn about being diplomatic and is now just slagging on the eu , which i also have a hard time seeing . 
  was similarly true in washington state up until a few years ago . 
  then [ in this case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enumclaw_horse_sex_case ) the prosecutors found that the acts were n't cruel or harmful to the stallion -- it was only the guy who wound up being hurt by it :  the prosecutor 's office wanted to charge tait with animal abuse , but the police found no evidence of abused animals on the many videotapes they collected from his home . 
  as there was no law against humanely having sex with one horse , the prosecutors could only charge tait with trespassing . 
  after that , they * did * ban it in the state , though . 
   they have a lot more nukes than anyone but the u.s. 
  they 've actually [ have 4.7 % more warheads than we do today ] ( http://www.icanw.org/the-facts/nuclear-arsenals/ ) . 
  that being said , that 's warhead count , and i do n't know what total yield of each arsenal is like -- some warheads are significantly more-powerful than others . 
  also not sure how well-maintained the russian weapons or their delivery systems are . 
   there is no good editor for latex for the end-user . 
  fwiw , i do n't use [ lyx ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lyx ) , but it slaps a wysiwyg face on latex . 
   how many hours did it take you to learn c++ , matlab , git , matplotlib ? 
  have n't used matplotlib . 
  it did n't take me long to pick up a minimal , basic understanding with the others , but becoming proficient in them ? 
  probably a couple years of use of git . 
  dunno what percentage of time was actually lost due to non-familiarity , but it was in there . 
  i definitely would take longer to dash off a formatted document in latex than microsoft office even today . 
  these are people who use microsoft office every day -- they 've got the required level of familiarity . 
  libreoffice would be disruptive but at least transfer * some * degree of knowledge . 
  latex ? 
  you 're starting at ground zero . 
   if you wan na be dependent on 3rd private parties for even the most basic needs , go ahead . 
  i do n't ; i 've written more material in latex than word over the past twenty years . 
  but i 'm also not running an office somewhere in belgium with a lot of people who are not likely to spend a big chunk of their life using text editors . 
  and i 'm not sure that on the net , i 've gained time ( even if i 've enjoyed knowing it ) . 
  if they transition anywhere , it will be to libreoffice , not latex . 
  hershey [ sells some candy bars that use vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter ] ( http://www.today.com/food/chocoholics-sour-new-hersheys-formula-2d80555560#.uilf7htvoyk ) , but this is n't one of them . 
  [ take a look at the ingredients list on its back ] ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/6150fgujwbl._sl1000_.jpg ) . 
   how would latex lack ? 
  how many hours did it take you to learn latex ? 
  how many paid hours will it require their employees ? 
  i mean , they already had to pay for a microsoft office skillset , and i suspect that it takes less time to become functional with that . 
   in the u.s. , steel tariffs attempt to make up the total difference between the price of dumped steel and the cost of production -- meaning duties above 250 percent are not uncommon . 
  i really hope that there 's a direct national security justification for that . 
  just to be clear , because the ruble exchange rate and the pound exchange rate has been in the news recently , the absolute value of a particular unit of currency is meaningless . 
  you can choose your unit of currency to be anywhere -- a us dollar could as easily have been arbitrarily selected to be worth as much as a us penny . 
  when people say that a currency is `` strong '' or `` weak '' , they 're talking about the relative shifts among those currencies , not the absolute values of the basic unit of currency . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_yen ) , the japanese yen , which has a relatively-small base unit of currency , started life at 360/usd and has since then shifted to be about 80 to the dollar -- which so people would have used the term `` a strong yen '' , even though many would be needed to purchase a dollar -- and then weakened to [ about 100 to the dollar ] ( https://www.dailyfx.com/usd-jpy ) . 
  edit : what you 'd be interested in would be relative shifts , like [ gbp to eur conversion rates over time ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=eur&amp;view=10y ) . 
  edit2 : if you want a single `` snapshot '' number that measures change in currency strength , maybe use the percentage increase or decrease relative to the usd over the past n years , and rank those .
