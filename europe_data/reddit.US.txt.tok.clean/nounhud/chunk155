  my understanding is that wallonia 's thing is heavily-subsidized milk , not salt .

  drones are considered to be a lightweight , unlikely-to-escalate option . 
  honestly , the british are probably more upset with said anarchists than the french are . 
  the french police are dealing with it because they have jurisdiction in france . 
  i would imagine that if they requested people , that the brits would send them , but i doubt that most countries are gung-ho on foreign law enforcement unless the shit is truly hitting the fan .

  this quote was brought up many times on reddit between folks in the us during the bush administration . 
  the primary material only covers some of the material ( i assume that the majority of the material in days of talking to someone is a lot less-interesting ) , and the nuremburg transcripts appear to only use summarized form ( and were really only interested in establishing criminal guilt through knowledge of holocaust activity ) . 
  the primary material is apparently out-of-print , but you might enjoy [ this ] ( https://www.amazon.com/nazi-psychiatrist-hermann-douglas-meeting/dp/161039156x/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=utf8&amp;amp%3bpi=sl75_ql70&amp;amp%3bqid=1477309513&amp;amp%3bsr=1-1&amp;ref_=mp_s_a_1_1 ) , which i have not read . 
  it 's a metaphor from the us frontier settlement , showed up in western movies . 
  there were raids by indians ( native american `` indian '' ) on european-descent settlers . 
  for mutual protection and assistance , those settlers often traveled in groups , using convoys of [ covered wagons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/covered_wagon ) . 
  the great plains were open , featureless plains without much by way of terrain to use for natural defense . 
  if attacked , one would bring the line of wagons into a circle and place the settlers inside , a sort of makeshift fort that prevented attackers from coming from behind and gave the settlers the benefit of short [ interior lines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interior_lines ) . 
  it 's [ survived as an idiom in modern-day english ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/circle_the_wagons ) , meaning to have everyone adopt a defensive posture in the face of a common threat . 
  goats are legal in finland and in some states here . 
  edit : hmm . 
  i think somehow i responded to the wrong post -- i 'd responded to something talking about someone criticizing people as having sex with goats .

  at this point , if `` cooperation '' means `` drop sanctions and let putin get away with doing what he wants '' , i do n't agree . 
  but if russia will pull out of crimea and donbas , i 'd agree that economic ties after that would be a good carrot . 
  i still think that it 's weird that you guys use `` european '' to mean `` from the eu '' and weird that the brits use it to mean `` from the continent proper '' . 
  oh , i 'm sure that it also has a positive meaning , but i mean that the the gay slang term might not be well known . 
  as it did with you , it jumped to the front of my mind when seeing a shirtless bear next to a gay pride sign . 
  my guess is that the association may not exist in russia . 
  it might be that `` bear '' does n't have the same [ meaning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bear_\\ ( gay_culture \\ ) ) in russia . 
  using sanctions is n't being thwarted . 
  people circle the wagons when the indians come or they 're told they 're coming . 
  when the us army had a psychologist interrogating goering :  goering : why , of course , the people do n't want war . 
  why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece . 
  naturally , the common people do n't want war ; neither in russia , nor in england , nor in america , nor for that matter in germany . 
  that is understood . 
  but , after all , it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along , whether it is a democracy , or a fascist dictatorship , or a parliament , or a communist dictatorship . 
    gilbert : there is one difference . 
  in a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives , and in the united states only congress can declare wars . 
    goering : voice or no voice , the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders . 
  that is easy . 
  all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked , and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger . 
  it works the same in any country . 
  putin 's told russians that nato is at risk of suddenly attacking them . 
  he did it because it worked . 
  i think that there 's a great tendency to overattribute the actions of nations to some sort of national character . 
  the germans did not , as a nation , `` go mad '' around the time of hitler , as quickly as people at the time leapt to that explanation . 
  they did [ what any of us would have done ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milgram_experiment ) . 
  assume otherwise and you risk making grave errors as to cause and cure ...

  honestly , of everyone here , you lot have probably been burnt the most by this affair . 
  edit : well , maybe short of ukrainians . 
  it is n't even us . 
  a statistic i dug up a while back : germany 's second and third largest-states combined are economically larger than russia after the post-ukraine-invasion economic business . 
  can you also provide a link to the official account in question so that it 's possible to confirm that it 's real ? 
  not saying that it 's not ... just that it 's not what i 'd expect diplomats to send out . 
  wow , that 's the opposite of the us , where rural areas tend to be poorer and female . 
   some of them even have direct links to sketchy organizations such as neo-legionary groups . 
  i 'm assuming that their thing is n't re-establishing the roman empire . 
  ah , maybe * this * is what they meant by `` we can be the singapore of europe '' . 
  i was thinking about being a major banking and shipping port off the continent , but maybe i misunderstood . 
  we have a 39.1 % corporate tax rate , and we 've still got companies . 
  given that the most strategically-unimportant place would also be the most-unlikely to be targeted during a war , it 's also probably the safest . 
  the safest place is strategically-important , since you 'd want to put critical things there ... and so we 've arrived at a [ berry 's paradox ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/berry_paradox ) - type conundrum . 
  ukraine 's gon na need cash . 
  it 's got ta wind up there somehow . 
  the eu gon na send $ 2b in development funds per year to just hold things at the current level ? 
  seems like that 's mostly political . 
  i mean , i could see the bureaucracy handling it without needing a new appointee . 
  if everyone in the roi government were ignoring it , i 'm sure that that would be a problem . 
  not an issue -- more than one scoring mechanism can coexist . 
  we 've got competing scoring systems . 
  there 's a big edge in being able to price credit accurately . 
  i would imagine that finance companies would love to do this , but it probably is n't legal . 
   the law is not meant to apply to anyone . 
  it 's meant to apply to ideas - it 's there to promote the traditional family . 
  huh . 
  we used to have the exact opposite -- [ sodomy itself was illegal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sodomy_laws_in_the_united_states ) , but advocacy would have been protected by the first amendment . 
  i suspect that this was the case for most of europe as well . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_serval  operation serval followed the united nations security council resolution 2085 of 20 december 2012 and an official request by the malian interim government for french military assistance .

   i never really understood the design , it seems they built them with an excessive amount of tonnage , but do n't have the features or the plane capacity to excuse it .
