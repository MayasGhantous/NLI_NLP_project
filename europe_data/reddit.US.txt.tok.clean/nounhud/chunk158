  * then everyone was worried that without a common threat , the states would break up . 
  * multiple financial disasters . 
  currency collapses ( helped by british counterfeiting ) . 
  * decision to invade canada fails . 
  british burn our capital . 
  * national bank expires . 
  * secession attempts from portions of member states . 
  that 's about the first thirty-five years or so . 
  how 's the eu compared ? 
   bojo her minister of foreign affairs said the we were a corpse with shackles on . 
  i think that 's just his style . 
  he 's got some pretty colorful criticisms of a lot of people . 
   the eu might very well die soon why ? 
  like , in what way would it be net advantageous for members to be out of the eu ? 
  may is tory , and the guardian is center-left . 
  an effort to make may look silly ? 
  we do n't have an air-to-air missile that is that long-range any more . 
  i dunno what the history there is . 
  gps and similar systems ( europe 's galileo , russia 's glonass , etc ) are cryptographically-signed , so you could not forge messages . 
  however , i understand that you can jam a message and broadcast it with an iota of delay , which will , if done perfectly , make the device think that it 's elsewhere . 
  wo n't stop critical military systems , since they 've got inertial guidance backup . 
  could cause a lot of commercial harm . 
   * on the other hand , negotiating an agreement with other countries outside the eu should become easier . 
  to put it bluntly , the british government will not need to care what the walloon parliament , for example , thinks yes , brits . 
  we get the point . 
  no need to keep hitting the sledgehammer . 
   pretty ridiculous of her to blame the entire eu -- all but half of one country were in favour of this version of the deal . 
  maybe . 
  you know how you sometimes have legislative votes that pass by one or fail by one vote , because they were unpopular or popular ? 
  could be that wallonia 's just the designated scapegoat . 
   just in recent yerars , the eu has failed to close trade deals with singapore , usa , australia , india , canada , the gulf countries . 
  the only significant one in the last decade was the south korea fta . 
  they 're on their way to become the china of the 21st century . 
  actually , china 's been pulling ahead of the eu on this ... ftas with india , australia , [ most of southeastern asia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asean%e2%80%93china_free_trade_area ) , japan , and south korea . 
   because the people involved in running the eu seem completely unable or unprepared to admit the organisation 's failings . 
  have they ? 
  if anything , the eu seems to talk about deeper integration , which i would expect would be a shift towards giving a central authority greater ability to take action . 
   trade deals are an example of where the eu model comes unstuck , they have taken 7 years to negotiate a trade deal with canada and they still ca n't manage it . 
  utterly shambolic . 
  i 'm not disputing that this is n't a good showing , but i take issue with the idea that the eu * could n't * do something like this . 
   their solution to everything is more europe . 
  they see federalism as the answer to europe 's failings . 
  is n't the lack of this precisely what you 're complaining about ? 
  the us and canada are both federations with centralized federal authority to establish ftas . 
  well , they did manage to get through an association agreement with you . 
  it looks like the largest successfully-signed eu fta so far has been with turkey . 
  setting aside the issue of whether ttip would be an issue , if the concern is that canada would be in an fta with both the eu and the us ... you 've already been in an fta with mexico , which is as much a nafta member as canada . 
   not that it 's a bad thing , i 'm personally quite pleased that ceta is going to it 's grave . 
  why ? 
  i would have considered it to be desirable for canada . 
  on some things , i agree . 
  however , that does not work with fta authority because you have a customs union , and a fundamental characteristic of that is that individual members can not negotiate trade deals . 
  same objection that you 'd have if the uk started cutting deals with the outside world . 
  you got ta actually give the full eu the authority to cut trade deals with a less-restrictive bar than vetos across the board if you want to establish those deals , unless you want to section up the eu into separate , divided organizations . 
  i think that latter approach would be a terrible idea for any number of reasons . 
  [ at least some , if not all of your existing ftas also sport isds . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ), 
  i do n't see why vetos on trade agreements need be fundamental to the eu . 
  why is reform impossible ? 
  to the extent that one could say a country could be `` trusted '' in a meaningful way , i 'd say that canada 's probably up there . 
  canada knows about sub-national francophone groups that can really dig in their heels . 
  yeah ... if the trade deal is worth $ 50b to just , say , france , then every other eu member is gon na want to extract about 1/28th of $ 50b in concessions from france . 
  and the way they do it is via playing chicken . 
  and if just one decides not to stop , everyone crashes , which means that france probably winds up losing out on the $ 50b . 
  problem is , even though majority vote or another weaker bar would almost certainly be advantageous to the eu , individual members got ta extend enough trust to the others that majority coalitions wo n't seek do them harm , because if you give up veto power , you give up a strong defense against abuse in exchange for being able to do things that otherwise would n't be possible . 
  i dunno much about how that process happens in other organizations , but it clearly can . 
  we got rid of our [ department of war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_department_of_war ) after world war ii and replaced it with the [ department of defense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_department_of_defense ) . 
  it looks like everyone did the same thing at about the same time . 
  germany : [ reichswehrministerium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ministry_of_the_reichswehr ) to the [ bundesministerium der verteidigung ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_ministry_of_defence_\\ ( germany \\ ) ) uk : [ war office ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_office ) and related institutions became the [ ministry of defense ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ministry_of_defence_\\ ( united_kingdom \\ ) ) japan : [ ministry of war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ministry_of_war_of_japan ) became the [ ministry of defense ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ministry_of_defense_\\ ( japan \\ ) ) . 
  hahaha ... they would rather illegally enter the us , drive across the entire us , illegally enter canada , and try for asylum in canada than face the immigration detention and other limitations in the us :  if the romanians were to present themselves at a canadian border post , they would be refused entry and told to seek asylum in the united states , which has more difficult requirements and where asylum seekers are not eligible for welfare benefits . 
  just out of curiosity , which are your favorites ? 
  on a related note , i noted a while back that [ unsc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council ) permanent seat status is more-or-less a mapping to [ second strike ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_strike ) capability . 
  not sure if that 's coincidental or what . 
  not to mention that whole roman empire business !, 
  fair point . 
  [ for fuck 's sake , canada . 
  fix your farms too ] ( http://www.milkproduction.com/library/editorial-articles/overview-on-milk-prices-and-production-costs-world-wide-/ ) . 
  yeah , but that 's because they are only going to build 3 ( rather than the original 32 ) , so r&d costs are overwhelming . 
  think of it as the price to keep a technological military edge . 
  the large us [ c-5 galaxy military transport ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/c-5-serv.htm ) :  the maintenance man hour per flying hour illustrates the difficulties in the c-5 force . 
  the a models consumed 46.0 maintenance man hours per flying hour , 16.7 for the b model ( cy96 data ) . 
  [ the us main battle tank ] ( http://www.alu.army.mil/alog/issues/sepoct99/ms441.htm ) :  even more significant than reliability improvements , maintainability in terms of maintenance man-hours per operating hour decreased from 2.67 for the original m1 to 0.85 for m1a2 . 
  granted , some of that maintenance can be parallelized -- this is man-hours , not total hours . 
  i remember being somewhat bowled over when i first saw the percentage of time that world war ii tanks had to spend in maintenance ( which i ca n't find a link for at the moment ) . 
  [ russia , i am shocked and appalled ] ( http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-04/news/ct-talk-tommy-gun-lawsuit-20130404_1_submachine-gun-new-york-company-vodka-maker ) that you would create such a thing . 
   i have n't said it was real reason , but in soviet union aircraft careers were n't seen in a good light . 
  well , i 'd buy that . 
  same deal in the us with the ak-47 -- i mean , it 's just a rifle , but [ it 's got symbolism above-and-beyond that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ak-47#cultural_influence_and_impact ) . 
   during the cold war , the soviet union and the people 's republic of china , as well as united states and other nato nations supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries and rebel forces around the world . 
  during this time the western countries used relatively expensive automatic rifles , such as the fn fal , the hk g3 , the m14 , and the m16 . 
  in contrast , the russians and chinese used the ak-47 ; its low production cost and ease of manufacture allow them to make aks in vast numbers   in the pro-communist states , the ak-47 became a symbol of third-world revolution . 
  during the 1980s , the soviet union became the principal arms dealer to countries embargoed by western nations , including middle eastern nations such as iran , libya , and syria , which welcomed soviet union backing against israel . 
  [ snip ]  in russia , the kalashnikov is a tremendous source of national pride . 
  [ snip ]  the proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers . 
  the ak-47 is included in the flag of mozambique and its emblem , an acknowledgment that the country gained its independence in large part through the effective use of their ak-47s . 
  [ 166 ] it is also found in the coats of arms of east timor and the revolution era burkina faso , as well as in the flags of the hezbollah and new people 's army . 
    some western countries associate the ak-47 with their enemies ; both cold war era and present-day . 
  for example , western movies often portray criminals , gang members and terrorists using ak-47s . 
  for these reasons , in the u.s. and western europe the ak-47 is stereotypically regarded as the weapon of choice of insurgents , gangsters and terrorists . 
  conversely , throughout the developing world , the ak-47 can be positively attributed with revolutionaries against foreign occupation , imperialism , or colonialism .
