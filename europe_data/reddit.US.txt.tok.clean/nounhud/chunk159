  [ 156 ] for the soviet union , producing automatic weapons * en masse * allowed them to close the military technology gap that allowed western colonialism to exist in places like africa , and terminate those empires : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maxim_gun  it played an important role in the swift european colonization of africa in the late 19th century . 
  the extreme lethality was employed to devastating effect against obsolete charging tactics , when native opponents could be lured into pitched battles in open terrain . 
  as it was put by hilaire belloc , in the words of the figure `` blood '' in his poem `` the modern traveller '' :    whatever happens , we have got     the maxim gun , and they have not . 
  [ 8 ] then high tech countries came back with ground attack aircraft . 
  not much good a rifle will do against them . 
  the us did similar stuff with the ussr in countering ground-attack aircraft in dumping [ stingers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_soviet_aircraft_losses_during_the_soviet%e2%80%93afghan_war ) into afghanistan :  a leading cause of lost aircraft was due to the introduction of the stinger missile system the fim-92 stinger ... 
  probably happened elsewhere , too . 
  now , [ high-flying drones ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_atomics_mq-1_predator ) are , i guess , the current `` can beat up on low-tech countries at little cost or risk '' tool . 
  those have yet to be countered ... 
  that being said , i think that ship class names have more to do with politics than anything else . 
  the first destroyer class the us had was the [ * bainbridge * - class ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bainbridge-class_destroyer ) , which displaced 630 long tons . 
  the first battleship the us had was the [ * uss indiana * ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/uss_indiana_\\ ( bb-1 \\ ) ) , which displaced 10,288 long tons . 
  the newest us destroyer class is the [ * zumwalt * - class ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/zumwalt-class_destroyer ) , which displaces 14,564 long tons , about one-and-a-half older battleships . 
   admiral kyznetsov is n't your typical aircraft carrier , it 's `` heavy aircraft carrying missile cruiser '' ( because soviet union could n't have anything `` imperialistic '' serving in armed forces ) nah . 
  sounds nice and idealistic , but no . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montreux_convention_regarding_the_regime_of_the_straits  however , under article 11 , black sea states are permitted to transit capital ships of any tonnage through the straits . 
  annex ii specifically excludes aircraft carriers from the definition of capital ships , but limits the definition of carriers to ships that are designed primarily for carrying and operating aircraft at sea and specifically excludes other ships that merely are able to operate aircraft . 
  [ 13 ]   the result of this is that by designing its aircraft carrying ships such as kiev and admiral kuznetsov to have roles other than aircraft operation and by designating those ships as `` aircraft carrying cruisers '' rather than `` aircraft carriers '' the soviet union was able to transit its aircraft carrying ships through the straits in compliance with the convention , while at the same time the convention denied access to nato aircraft carriers , which are not covered by the exemption in article 11 . 
  http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21709060-tiny-region-belgium-opposes-trade-reasons-are-hard-understand-wallonia  wallonia boasts one cow for every three humans and its lavishly subsidised farmers are wary of cheap canadian competition . 
  erwin sch\u00f6pges , a walloon dairy farmer who joined the protests outside parliament , says he already faces milk prices below his production costs . 
  `` we want to trade with canada , but we would rather not abolish tariffs , '' he says . 
  for fuck 's sake , wallonia . 
  fix your farms . 
  i think that you 've confused `` not fit for human consumption '' with `` extremely large and delicious '' . 
  the uk is about a quarter of the eu 's military budget , iirc . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i 'm not opposed to them , just to starting out with an incomplete game . 
  i know that you 're joking , but adams was opposed to democracy and wanted republicanism . 
   remember , democracy never lasts long . 
  it soon wastes , exhausts , and murders itself . 
  there was never a democracy yet that did not commit suicide . 
  this seems like the most politically-damaging way to cancel a brexit . 
  why ? 
  3d printers are kinda not really `` there '' for distributing machines in a practical sense . 
  also , weight is at a premium , and that 's not weight-efficient . 
  that 's not what wikipedia says . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grammatical_gender  a typological survey of 174 languages revealed that over one fourth of them had grammatical gender most are ungendered . 
  i 'm almost certain that politicians have lied in the past . 
  just switch to having the ep approve trade agreements . 
  it 's not a fundamental issue . 
  we do fine with that approach . 
  do you * want * to have the constraint that every member try and extract as many concessions out of every other member as possible on each vote ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_great_britain_\\ ( marxist % e2 % 80 % 93leninist \\ ) you need to put a backslash before parens in the url . 
  why not ? 
  so how many years do i wait until the `` full '' product is complete this time ? 
  the `` father '' in `` patriotism '' is `` fatherland '' , not `` your biological father '' . 
  i do n't see how you can derive race from that . 
  hollande does n't need to sell the british leadership . 
  the bureaucracy would n't want to hard brexit anyway . 
  what he needs to sell is the british people so that it 's politically-viable in the uk . 
  and the `` the eu is an overbearing threat '' stuff in the tabloids is what this sounds like . 
  it wo n't make that easier . 
  he could have made the same statement and talked about regrets and fairness or something like that instead . 
  i think that it does n't help from a standpoint of the publics in the eu to have unpleasant public statements thrown around by national leaders . 
  what happens at private negotiating table is up to the bureaucrats . 
  maybe it 's a good idea in french politics , but surely not from an eu-wide position . 
  sure , maybe you say `` well , i do n't think that he should worry about that '' , but was n't it that sort of mindset that led to brexit ? 
  i mean , let 's say that it 's good politics in greece to repeatedly have the pm call germany nazi . 
  it 'll clearly have implications for the views of people in greece . 
  she said something about being tougher on immigration a bit back . 
   the british can only view foreign relations through their experience of imperialism and power politics . 
  i think that the brits really are n't all that different from you . 
  i 'm very dubious about claims of some sort of national psychology that makes people not able to see the world as it is . 
  the world 's been pretty peaceful since world war ii , and we did n't start that . 
  build more houses so that there 's room to fill the added demand ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occupation_of_iceland like locusts , as is tradition !, 
   in some years this equaled 25 % of the population or almost 50 % of the native male population . 
  and we have n't even had the / r/europe iceland meetup yet !, 
   you will never , ever see deportation of citizens or people with permanent residency unless there 's a return of full-on fascism . 
  unless someone with permanent residency commits a crime . 
  i [ just linked to this earlier , on us immigration law ] ( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/crimes-that-will-make-immigrant-deportable.html ) :  the full list of crimes that are considered aggravated felonies under immigration law ( which is different from criminal law ) is extensive and may be found in the immigration and nationality act at i.n.a. 
  it includes such crimes as murder ; rape ; drug or firearms trafficking ; sexual abuse of a minor ; child pornography ; money laundering , fraud or tax evasion involving more than $ 10,000 ; theft or violent crime with a sentence order of at least one year ( it is irrelevant if it was suspended or if you only had to serve part of it ) ; espionage , sabotage , or treason ; perjury with a sentence of at least one year ; and more . 
    if you were convicted of an aggravated felony at any time , there will be very little that you can do to avoid deportation , unless you can prove it is more likely than not that you would be tortured in your native country upon return . 
  a waiver to return to the u.s. will not be available for any purpose . 
  you should obtain competent counsel who can help you avoid an aggravated felony conviction that will permanently render you inadmissible to the united states . 
  if you 're referring to mass deportations , yeah , i agree . 
   let ordinary people live under whatever regime they can stand . 
  at least they 'll live and it will be up to them if they want to risk their lives for their freedom . 
  the idea is that if an elected government can operate as a stable entity for a long-enough period of time , then people can use `` little revolutions '' of elections like you or i do to address their grievances . 
  avoids the sort of conflict that 's seen today between isis and the iraqi government . 
  we did n't rebel against you guys without [ help from the french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_revolutionary_war ) , but we did n't collapse once they left , and there are no shortage of similar historical situations . 
  seems kinda like in the past , providing that initial impetus has been able to produce a viable state even if it would n't have necessarily been produced on its own . 
  do you think that iraq could be , say , like turkey , as opposed to a dictatorship ? 
  do you think that it 'd be preferable if it were ? 
   honestly sometimes i think these warrior worshiping societies like the us and the british need to use their military against something in order to release their internal tensions every few years . 
  i 'd call it a perversion if it was n't so destructive to others . 
  how viable do you think that ireland 's neutrality is for the broader world ? 
  sure , it works for ireland in ireland 's specific situation . 
  but if you want much of the rest of the world to do the same thing , you have to ask very hard questions about the practicality of that . 
  let 's suppose that it were 1939 and the us and the uk and france were the same way , not getting involved , avoiding a military . 
  how would things have worked out for ireland in the long run ? 
  switzerland was neutral too , and she managed to [ postpone things by making like a porcupine and hunkering down in armed neutrality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henri_guisan ) ... but if it were n't for conflict tying up other powers , she would have eventually been engaged and fallen . 
  or include germany , and consider what a europe with everything on the other side of the iron curtain might have looked like . 
  yeah , there is no doubt times when we 've erred on the side of conflict . 
  but to simply say `` no , preparing for and taking part in conflict is just inherently * bad * '' is , i 'd say , at least as incorrect . 
  the `` you ca n't have one army without a common foreign policy '' is an argument that i 've made and agree with . 
  but ... it 's not clear what exactly is involved . 
  if it 's doing purchasing as a bloc , i agree -- that gets tied up with foreign policy to at least some degree . 
  you 're choosing to put air defenses in central europe or an aircraft carrier in french ports or slashing spending and shifting spending to irish social services . 
  but if it 's a eu tax or mandatory minimum contribution or similar , it does n't .
