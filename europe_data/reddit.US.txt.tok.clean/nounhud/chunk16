  the uk * did * have less relative conflict than the mainland over the last century , but [ the uk could reasonably to have been said to have had a low-level civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles ) . 
   in the uk we build houses , then allow people to walk between them and tarmac over the dirt paths created . 
  in europe they build the paths and then put up signs saying `` do not walk on the grass '' . 
  this is called a [ desire path ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/desire_path ) , and has fans at / r/desirepath http://www.copenhagenize.com/2009/04/subconscious-democracy-and-desire.html  you can stand there and issue fines until you 're blue in the face or you can do what the city of copenhagen does : respect the peoples ' desire line - as decided by subconscious democratic consensus - and turn it into a bike lane . 
    the phrase desire line , or desire path , was coined by the french philosopher gaston bachelard in his book * the poetics of space * , from 1958 . 
  sounds reasonably continental .

  [ * the economist * , `` german services : protected and inefficient '' ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21547837 ) :  when mario monti became italy 's prime minister , german pharmacists fretted . 
  not for what he would do in italy but because , as europe 's competition tsar , he tried to liberalise professional services such as law , medicine and pharmacy . 
  mr monti is now prising open italy 's closed professions -- and thinks europe 's biggest economy should do the same . 
  there is `` still lots of room for a liberalisation of services '' in germany , he said recently . 
    germany is not often told to reform . 
  its big manufacturers , trade surpluses and robust jobs market make it the envy of europe . 
  france 's nicolas sarkozy promises to make his country more like germany . 
  it is resented for its strength , but rarely chided for weakness . 
  yet germany 's manufacturing juggernaut sits alongside puny services . 
  in 2000-07 , value added in market services grew by 2.2 % a year , compared with an average of 3.1 % in the oecd group of rich countries . 
  in business services , productivity grew by 0.9 % a year in germany in 2000-08 , against 1.7 % in the oecd . 
    this holds back the economy . 
  potential gdp growth will fall below 1 % by 2020 as the population ages , says an oecd country survey this week . 
  investment as a share of gdp is well below the norm among g7 economies , one reason for those trade surpluses . 
  germany has deficits in education , immigration and finance , but regulation of services is a big issue . 
  `` what sticks out is protection of the liberal professions , '' says andreas w\u00f6rg\u00f6tter at the oecd . 
    only qualified pharmacists can own a pharmacy , and they are limited to four . 
  other shops may not compete , even for non-prescription drugs . 
  such rules are typical of the liberal professions , which account for a tenth of gdp and employ 4.2 m. 
  they dictate who may offer what sort of service , the charges allowed for professionals and how they may advertise . 
  in many professions , investment by outsiders is restricted . 
  handwerk , which embraces 150 trades from bakery to plumbing and employs 5.1 m , has its own rules . 
    regulation of professional services is stricter in germany than in all but five of 27 countries ranked by the oecd . 
  when it comes to reserving activities to holders of professional qualifications , germany acts more like a stodgy southerner than a nimble northerner . 
  according to a study for the european commission of three sectors in 13 countries , germany has more reserved professions than all but one . 
    an american used to ads trumpeting ambulance-chasing lawyers and headache-remedies from walmart would find germany eerily peaceful . 
  doctors practise mostly on their own . 
  lawyers tend to be generalists and work in small groups , says markus hartung , at the german bar association . 
  deregulation would be disruptive : many generalist `` country lawyers '' could be swept away . 
    but it would have a big payoff . 
  livelier services might encourage the sort of game-changing innovation that is more common in america than in germany . 
  in the field of legal services , `` bigger firms would offer more quality at less money , '' mr hartung believes . 
  new business models would emerge . 
  companies offering legal insurance might buy law firms to handle customers ' claims , for example . 
    if germany were to reduce services regulation to the level of the most liberal countries , it could boost annual productivity growth by a percentage point a year over ten years , says one study . 
  wages and domestic demand would rise and the current-account surplus would fall . 
  that ought to appeal to chancellor angela merkel , who would welcome ways to boost growth without more public spending . 
  germany has already loosened up a bit . 
  prices of non-prescription drugs have been freed and in trades such as brewing a master 's certificate is no longer required . 
  but further change will not be easy . 
    politicians are reluctant to tamper with the handwerk , whose apprenticeships keep down unemployment among the young . 
  the liberal professions are largely self-regulating and perform functions that the state might otherwise have to , such as setting standards and providing training . 
  quality and competition in german professions compare well with the rest of europe , says rolf koschorrek , president of the federal association of liberal professions and a bundestag member from mrs merkel 's own party . 
  mr monti , he says , `` has enough to do in italy . 
  it 's not necessary to get involved in germany 's affairs . '', 
   it 's fanatically free market ...

  well , pulling out of the eu does n't seem likely to improve that bit . 
  there are 36m people in canada .

  it would not have been possible to determine that the plane was armed at a range where it could have attacked the ship . 
  the ship 's commander gambled that it would not have attacked -- it 's peacetime ( at least as much as it was during the cold war , at any rate ) , there 's no information about any other pending attacks , that ship did n't have anything that would have been of critical national concern .
