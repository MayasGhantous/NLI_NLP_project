  in fact , it solves the [ public good problem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_good ) with national defense . 
  additionally , though the eu may not want to take this route ( and the eu 's different tax structure may not make sense for it ) , in the us , due to the constitutional breakdown of powers , outside of social security and medicare , most federal spending is military in one way or another . 
  that federal spending is the mechanism that drives interstate fiscal transfers . 
  there are also ways to replicate some of this benefit by passing legislation on the client side rather than the server side . 
  imho , this is much more viable . 
  it provides privacy benefits to eu users rather than crippling the ability of eu companies to compete with overseas competitors that can use this data and protects eu users regardless of whether the server is located outside of eu jurisdiction . 
  legislate that : * eu isps regularly switch netblocks * eu isps randomize ips with more than a certain pool size on new dhcp leases * eu isps unless the user opts out nat ip addresses in a pool of more than n users to one address * eu isps provide an opaque http proxy service free of charge to customers and that [ autoconfiguration of the isp-provided proxy be default ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web_proxy_autodiscovery_protocol ) . 
  same idea as above -- each isp 's customers look like one . 
  [ xff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x-forwarded-for ) is disabled by default . 
  i 'd want to see the specifics , but otherwise , `` cjeu rules that personal ips ca n't be stored , * unless to thwart cybernetic attacks or similar . 
  * '' seems like it pulls any teeth the ruling has unless it nails down hard criteria for things that do not meet that level . 
  maybe in germany it 's not the norm for courts to define criteria , to just define a rationale and let later rulings deal with the specificals , but if this is all there is ... almost any online provider can make an argument that they need ip data to : * avoid abuse . 
  the internet is , by design , vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks due to flooding , and essentially every service provider is in some way vulnerable . 
  * optimize service . 
  determining whether a content distribution network would be a big win requires me knowing that half of my users are in zambia . 
  * doing market research . 
  this is n't an end-of-the-world need , but most businesses badly want general demographic data for their userbase . 
  * reduce fraud . 
  google and anyone who acts differently based on whether you 've been seen before ( steam , banks , a lot of captcha systems , etc ) is going to claim this . 
  it might restrict selling of that data , if personal data has a formal legal status in the eu . 
  that might be a plus , but it can have some major downsides . 
  i remember reading about some legislation -- maybe the gramm -- leach -- bliley act -- which prohibited the sale of personal financial data outside the company . 
  sounds nice . 
  the result was that financial services companies started merging into a few megabanks that could transfer information internally without restriction and using credit data to sell insurance and the like , one-stop-shops . 
  now , i could see some useful restrictions being applied . 
  requiring that data like this be encrypted or not retained in a form associated with a user for more than three months or not leave the eu or something like that might be viable restrictions . 
  but `` do not keep '' seems like it 's going to run afoul of legitimate needs sufficiently to be ignored . 
  i 'm thinking that he probably made several poor life decisions recently . 
  i do n't know how the uk works , but in the us , if you rape someone while trying to get citizenship , you are out of the system and [ you are n't getting another shot at citizenship ] ( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/crimes-that-will-make-immigrant-deportable.html ) . 
   the full list of crimes that are considered aggravated felonies under immigration law ( which is different from criminal law ) is extensive and may be found in the immigration and nationality act at i.n.a. 
  it includes such crimes as murder ; rape ; drug or firearms trafficking ; sexual abuse of a minor ; child pornography ; money laundering , fraud or tax evasion involving more than $ 10,000 ; theft or violent crime with a sentence order of at least one year ( it is irrelevant if it was suspended or if you only had to serve part of it ) ; espionage , sabotage , or treason ; perjury with a sentence of at least one year ; and more . 
    if you were convicted of an aggravated felony at any time , there will be very little that you can do to avoid deportation , unless you can prove it is more likely than not that you would be tortured in your native country upon return . 
  a waiver to return to the u.s. will not be available for any purpose . 
  you should obtain competent counsel who can help you avoid an aggravated felony conviction that will permanently render you inadmissible to the united states . 
  i 'm leaning towards that being someone 's legend . 
  it 's not just russia . 
  technology marches on , and it 's mostly relatively-increased demand for high-skill workers and relatively-reduced demand for lower-skill workers .

  `` in all oecd countries ` middle class ' occupations appear to be shrinking relative to those in the bottom as well as the top third , '' says mr van reenen . 
  edit : and actually the world bank is at odds with the article : * [ middle class jobs are thriving in central and eastern europe ] ( http://blogs.worldbank.org/jobs/middle-class-jobs-are-thriving-central-and-eastern-europe )  branko milanovic 's recent work on global inequality has shown extent to which the lower-middle class jobs in developed countries are being replaced by technology . 
  in particular , economists argue that middle-skilled , routine-intensive jobs are being hollowed-out . 
  and indeed , in western european countries and the us there has been a decrease in the intensity of routine tasks -- both manual and cognitive . 
  however , in central and eastern european ( cee ) countries , the amount of routine cognitive work has been on the rise . 
  and the pay for these workers has increased faster than for high skilled workers . 
  hmm . 
  do you have a source for that blocking the testing ? 
  i think that you 're pretty disconnected from consensus on that , but let 's skip that for now -- you were making an argument specifically about isds . 
  are you making the claim that isds were a catastrophe in nafta and that the eu 's existing ftas with isds were catastrophes ? 
  one of the big tils from the whole screening thing was how bad we are at managing to estimate biological age . 
  we can do so many crazy forensics things today . 
  from a dna sample , we can figure out whether someone is someone else 's kid . 
  we can determine , with pretty good accuracy , how long a body was dead . 
  we can identify someone someone if they touched a piece of glass and left fingerprints . 
  we can tell ( with some error ) how old a multi-thousand-year-old piece of fabric is . 
  we can tell where someone grew up from trace elements in the bones . 
  but to not be able to reliably do something as seemingly-simple as [ judging the age of a child ] ( https://www.nr.no/directdownload/1355995517/age_estimation_methods-eikvil.pdf ) without significant error is pretty frustrating . 
  the eyeless sharks would be sad ? 
  because they 're akin to a crippled human on earth ? 
  maybe * we 're * sad . 
  we 're from a line of animals that evolved to walk on four legs with their flesh hanging down . 
  we have to totter awkwardly on our hind legs , putting pressure on our spines that they were never meant to take , often causing spine problems later in life . 
  our eyes have a big blind spot in them because the nerves evolved backwards from something like a squid . 
  our brain does the best it can to fill it in , but it will never let you fully see . 
  you have three color receptors , so you can see colors composed of any combination of those , including magenta , which must be made of two different frequencies of light combined , not just one . 
  where you draw the lines between colors is arbitrary , but in some sense , you can only see a cube of colors -- red , green , blue each on a side . 
  but you will never have proper pentachromal vision , as a pigeon does , seeing colors in a `` five dimensional '' cube . 
  you wo n't ever see uv light -- just pictures painted in colors that you can see that try to let you imagine what it must be like . 
  your eyes are so myopic that you can only read something that while you have to hold a book right in front of your face to read it , half-a-meter away , an eagle could read the same thing two-and-a-half meters away easily . 
  you 're doomed to live about eighty years on average . 
  maybe at the outside edge and lots of help , you are extremely lucky and make it to 120 or so , as your body fails more and more . 
  a greenland shark can hunt and care for itself in the wild at 400 years old . 
  you can hear from only maybe 250hz to 20khz , and the top will decrease as you age . 
  you 'll never hear the 300khz that a moth can , or the half a hertz of a pigeon . 
  you can function maybe a minute without breathing air underwater . 
  you 'll always be bound to crawl along a surface , not able to effortlessly swim up and down wherever you want . 
  to lose a limb is a terrible thing : even today , we can at best create a crude prosthetic . 
  your mammal ancestors developed the ability to scar , to seal open wounds quickly , but in doing so they gave up the gift of regeneration , and settled for quick-and-dirty repairs . 
  you can easily climb to heights to which a misplaced foot is fatal . 
  your smaller , ratlike ancestors would have had a nonfatal terminal velocity -- they could fall as far as they wanted and survive . 
  you may enjoy the smell of baking bread -- but such a limited palette we have , compared to , say , an elephant or a bloodhound . 
  you 've never `` seen '' the world with echolocation like a bat , or wandered through its magnetic fields like a dolphin . 
  if you do n't feel sorry for your poor crippled self for not being any of these things ... why feel sorry for some eyeless shark , just because it 's not human ? 
  you have machine sorting in nyc ? 
  i 've been waiting for the day when we can just dispense with the recycling bin entirely and have machines extract anything useful from the trash . 
   `` when i went to calais there were caravans with notices on how to get coaching on what to say if you need to get into britain .

  hmm . 
  i guess you 're right -- france is well below , say , sweden . 
  thanks for the correction -- i 'd thought france had a high income tax as europe went , but that was based on the 75 % top bracket , which was in our news quite a bit , which is above most professionals and apparently expired . 
  nor is the wealth tax * that * large for a professional ( though for the trust fund crowd , i imagine that it 's no fun ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_in_france the difference with the us is on consumption tax . 
  almost all us federal and 65 % of state ( in california ) tax revenue comes from income tax -- sales tax is just 22 % of state . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_in_the_united_states http://www.sco.ca.gov/state_finances_101_state_taxes.html but in france , almost half of the total revenue is from consumption tax . 
  that being said , i also do n't realistically think that france is competing against the us . 
  if you 're a banker and you do n't need to be in the eu , you 're going to stay in the uk . 
  http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/4001/economics/tax-revenue-sources-in-uk/ i guess the uk is a bit closer to the us , but excise and vat are still about a quarter . 
  and looking at a few online tax discussions , it looks like france and the uk are n't all that out-of-whack . 
  i will concede the point .
