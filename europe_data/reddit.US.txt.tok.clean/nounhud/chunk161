  http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/  un charter , article 51 :   nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the united nations , until the security council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security . 
  measures taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the security council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the security council under the present charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security . 
  i believe that this is the legal basis . 
  isis engaged with iraq and extends into syria . 
  iraq requested coalition aid to fight isis ( once they got into a pretty serious position ) . 
  there 's perhaps some debate about whether or not this legitimately counts as a collective or what limits , if any , exist on the scope . 
  but there is a basis . 
  it 's an informal form , like `` brit '' or `` yank '' . 
  wiping out isis , which kicked over much of the iraqi government ? 
  well , you could dispute whether-or-not something represented a threat . 
  it would n't be in europe , so article 5 would n't apply anyway . 
  hat only covers attacks on north america or europe , which is why it did n't apply to the falklands . 
  as kerry pointed out , the buzzing crossed the line to the point where the ship commander could have ordered a shootdown -- that is , at that point , it was already up to unit commander judgement as to whether or not it was a threat . 
  that being said , afaik it was not repeated after that day , so i 'm assuming that it was a lone rooskie pilot hot-dogging and not an intentional strategy . 
  as i recall , french income taxes are no joke . 
  http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense-news/2016/06/06/navy-aircraft-carrier-strike-groups-deployed-china-russia-operations/85526820/  washington -- for the first time in nearly four years , the us navy has four aircraft carrier strike groups deployed at the same time . 
  two more carriers are carrying out local operations , making for six of the fleet 's ten active carriers underway -- an unusually high percentage . 
  and another is preparing to go . 
  [ snip ]  the last time four strike groups were deployed simultaneously was over a nine-week period from late august 2012 to early november 2012 , a navy spokesman said . 
  it 's not clear when the last time six or more carriers were underway . 
   on september 28 this year a canadian family holidaying in the bahamas reported to the police that their 8-year-old daughter was `` sexually molested online '' by assange on toddandclare.com , including propositioning her `` to perform oral and anal sex acts . '' she was presumably accessing the site through her 22-year-old sister 's account . 
  so ... did he know that he was talking to an eight-year-old , or did he think that he was talking to a twenty-two-year-old ? 
  i would guess that intent is an element of the crime . 
   `` we understand the family reported to the bahamas authorities that mr assange sent the 8-year-old juvenile ( i ) unlawful , indecent images and video media of himself performing lewd sex acts on a mobile camera device , and ( ii ) unlawful obscenity materials of a child pornographic nature that one he might be in trouble on . 
   the final clause notwithstanding , it 's not clear as yet whether he knew he was interacting with an 8-year-old or thought it was the 22-year-old account holder . 
  yeah . 
   `` but if a pilot is fired on or believes he is about to be fired on , he can defend himself .

  was it honestly not the case for the uk until now ? 
  it 's not a us institution -- it 's an international institution that 's located in the us .

  they have a physical presence somewhere , but they do n't operate `` beneath '' the law of the country where the seat is .

  the venue is located in the us , but is it using us law ? 
  i 'd assume not . 
  i thought that austria was mini-germany . 
  as promos go , this is kind of a neat one . 
  good story , photos , fixed cost , and a multi-way publicity win for tourism in the area , airbnb , whoever owns the castle and whoever owns the dracula rights . 
  if the financial bureaucracy in the eu becomes convinced that the euro requires reforms to persist , then , yes , i am sure that they will move for that . 
  why would anyone think otherwise ? 
  neither the uk nor the us are `` teetering on the brink of collapse '' . 
  i am pretty sure that this guy 's views are not representative of the typical leave voter . 
  eat your heart out , germany !, 
  imperial russia and the us basically got along . 
  went downhill with the bolsheviks . 
  world war ii was a high point -- though given the conflicting ideological goals , where one wanted world communism , and the other was dead-set against same , that was never going to be a comfortable relationship . 
  the cold war was obviously hostile . 
  post-cold-war , i guess the real issue was conflicting positions on whether states that russia considered to be in her `` sphere of influence '' could exit that sphere and link up with the eu instead . 
  i have no doubt that there 's room for cooperation between the eu and russia and ukraine on many economic matters . 
  so , to get things thawing , how about russia end its occupation of ukrainian territory in the form of donbas and crimea ? 
  russia could , of course , work with ukraine to ensure that the handover ensures the safety of the residents of the region , and i 'm sure that the un would be willing to referee to make sure that people are not ill-treated . 
  that would seem like an important first step on the path to cooperation . 
  it would eliminate many political pressures and tensions . 
  well , the airplane shootdown would have simply been an accident , even if the followup was less-than-diplomatic . 
  russia had no reason to want to intentionally bring down mh17 . 
  no disagreement on the other points , though . 
   the yanks have turned the propaganda thumb screws to our weak european governments and press . 
  this was an article in the ukrainian press citing an article in the british press talking about an attack on france that french law enforcement said was actually russian and not isis . 
  where exactly does the us come into this picture ? 
   moreover , german business associations accept what they call `` the primacy of politics '' : that national priorities set by government can trump their own . 
  a recent example was mrs merkel 's drive to convince the eu to impose sanctions on russia after its invasion of ukraine . 
  a pro-russian lobby called the ost-ausschuss ( committee on eastern europe ) opposed the sanctions . 
  but the federation of german industry , an affiliated but much larger lobby , declared that it accepted them as necessary in the long-term interest of maintaining the international order . 
  that ended the controversy . 
  ... `` the german government is now considered more-influential than german business . 
  i can prove this by giving an example where one german business lobby triumphed over another business lobby . '', 
  not saying that the thesis is wrong , but the argument does n't seem to support it .

   that would be 1 $ ... so about the other 2,50 $ ? 
  i 'm not following where you 're getting your numbers from . 
  that 's 58p tax on a liter , not a gallon .

  almost all of the price you 're paying in the uk -- about two-thirds -- is just tax .

  since the parent deleted their comment , which sub are you talking about as being biased ? 
  iirc , that 's mostly taxes . 
  europe has much higher taxes on gasoline . 
  http://www.wsj.com/articles/low-oil-prices-dont-trickle-down-much-to-european-drivers-1455168785  a big reason for the difference between europe and the u.s. -- the world 's top oil consumers -- are fuel taxes . 
  every liter of unleaded gasoline in the u.k. comes with a 58 pence excise tax plus a 20 % value-added tax on the price -- typical in european countries . 
    in the u.s. , there is a federal excise tax on gasoline at 18.4 cents a gallon , but there are also a wide range of state taxes -- from as little as 8.95 cents a gallon in alaska to 65.3 cents a gallon in pennsylvania . 
  for conversion purposes , note that a gallon is ~ 4l . 
  there are 193 member states in the un .
