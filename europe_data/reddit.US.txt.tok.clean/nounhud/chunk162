  < dubious  banks do n't normally go not doing business with people -- and definitely not freezing assets -- because someone who has a bad reputation happens to bank there . 
  i 'd be more-inclined to think that rt is looking at an ongoing `` did n't register as a foreign power 's agent '' investigation or whatever the brit equivalent of that is and part of the process is to freeze assets .

  in the us , it was generally found that there was less consumer resistance to reducing the size of packages than increasing price . 
  http://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/raise-prices-upset-customers.html  a new pricing study of the chicago ice cream market shows that consumers are four times as sensitive to price increases than they are to package downsizing ( charging the same for a smaller volume ) . 
  http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-to-avoid-a-price-increase  our data on consumers seems to support this logic . 
  first , consumers themselves report a greater sensitivity ( or awareness ) of price than of quantity . 
  second , in tracking the sale of snack foods we found that consumers reacted greatly to periodic changes in price , but not at all to periodic ( yet systematic ) reductions in quantity . 
  as a result , one manufacturer was able to reduce its package sizing by 10 percent to 20 percent over the course of three years with little to no negative consumer response . 
  my understanding with fn is that they were unlikely to pay back the money , which is why french banks were unwilling to lend . 
  if a bank based in russia does extend a loan , it 's probably true that it 's not a gift for the full dollar value of the loan . 
  it 's possible that fn will pay it back . 
  but it 's probably a good bet that the expected value of the loan is to be a loss , and that expected loss will be some portion of that dollar value .

  `` in history , france has always hesitated and swung between poland and russia : today , she is angry with the two , '' says arnaud dubien , director of the franco-russian centre .
