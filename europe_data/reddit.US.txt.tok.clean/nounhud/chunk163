  paris was bad after the veto put moscow on saturday , the united nations in a french draft resolution aimed at stopping the bombing in aleppo . 
  in new york , jean-marc ayrault has even lost its placidity . 
  since the weekend , the elysee has tried to explain that russia is alone against all , the reality is a bit more nuanced . 
  in the security council , a russian text was supported by china and egypt - the latter being also a `` strategic partner '' of paris ... and vladimir putin was on monday , received distinguished guest in istanbul by the turkish president recep tayyip erdogan . 
  there have been more solitary isolation . 
  paris finds himself well at loggerheads with poland and russia , while traditionally , tensions with a closer to each other . 
  `` it 's as if angry at the same time with the turks and the kurds , '' said one diplomat . 
  in poland , all gone to the government 's decision , announced tuesday to terminate negotiations on the acquisition of 50 caracal helicopters , a contract of 2.3 billion according to paris , won in april 2015 by airbus as a result of a tender . 
  the disagreement concerns the `` offset '' ( offsets ) that france was ready to consent to poland . 
  the case caused a stir in poland , especially because the national-conservative government ( pis ) annulled the decision of the previous government and the army urgently needed helicopters . 
  the first minister and the defense minister promised that a decision would be made `` very soon '' , with the acquisition of italian appliances or , more likely americans , blackhawk sikorski . 
  `` since the victory of pis in 2015 , it was written beforehand , '' explains mep arnaud danjean lr , who regrets `` that profound modification '' of politics warsaw . 
  with poland , `` we go back ten years back . 
  as noted at the top of bratislava in september , the poles are no longer on board the european defense '' . 
  normandy format . 
  in warsaw , french policy is not appreciated , even in hostile environments to the conservative government . 
  `` we went to africa with the french , first in chad and car and mali . 
  but within nato , france is the main opponent to strengthening the eastern flank `` against russia - a key issue for poland , says a source held to anonymity . 
  poland has not digested to be `` excluded '' negotiations on ukraine , in the normandy format ( paris , berlin , kiev and moscow ) . 
  `` in warsaw , is seen as a great betrayal , '' adds the same source polish . 
  french side , yet it says have been `` best allies '' , up to cancel the sale of the mistral to russia to reassure poland . 
  all this was to no avail and paris today dramatizes the clash with warsaw on the tone : `` this is not how one speaks to france . '', 
  `` we will review all of the cooperation , including military , which has with poland , '' said a diplomat who would not give much for the future of the `` weimar triangle '' ( paris , berlin , warsaw ) before a political change in poland . 
  with russia , `` the bilateral relationship had been preserved until now '' despite the ukraine and syria , says arnaud dubien . 
  the episode of the weekend may leave traces . 
  spitefully , arnaud dubien notes that `` russia no longer takes france seriously . '', 
  seen from moscow , the only major power in europe is germany and the united states remain the preferred partner of the kremlin , although tensions are vivid . 
  `` the russian leadership is convinced that hillary clinton will win and it will go wrong with it . 
  suddenly , the russians put the pressure before it gets to the white house , `` says arnaud dubien . 
  even analysis at thomas gomart , director of the french institute of international relations ( ifri ) : `` russia takes earnings before the elections . '', 
  hence the current rise in tensions , in which finds france on the syrian file . 
  but thomas gomart adds , `` until now , there was a division between the two major issues of syria and ukraine . 
  this seems to be possible . '', 
  in paris , the equation may be difficult to solve , because our diplomacy is now advanced against moscow on the first record , as it strives for calm on the second ... 
  cancel putin 's visit paris due to syria is to risk derailing the `` minsk process '' on the ukraine , with a meeting scheduled on the same day in berlin . 
  as said pascal boniface , director of the institute of international and strategic relations : `` better to see putin and express very strongly that our differences do not talk to him to appeal to the media and ngos . 
  because we can not solve this crisis without russia . '', 
  those are probably worth a fair penny today . 
  well , you may not like the comments on / r/europe , but i do -- i 'd like to see something closer to that . 
  i seem to recall seeing that on an older version of this map , too . 
  this is apparently a burning question . 
  does / r/europe turn into flamewars about politics ? 
  if you count the byzantine empire , the roman empire ran from 27 b.c. 
  to 1453 a.d. 1480 years is n't forever , but it 's a pretty good run . 
   there is no enabling underground economies , more that it is rather difficult to smoke them all out without mass survalience that would even suprass the us-system ( even they , despite of the work of the cia , have these underground economies ) . 
  thanks , bit keep in mind that we have no biometric database of citizens , no mandatory standard identity document , and can legally change our name at will without paperwork . 
  i want that subreddit but with : * no ban on discussion . 
  i think that the comics are great discussion-starters , and serious discussion is * verboten * . 
  this is my biggest complaint . 
  * remove the art style restrictions . 
  i do n't care if someone uses ms paint or line tools or not . 
  i 've seen some beautiful art on there and it 's made nudging up against restrictions . 
  * no ban on stateballs or on organizations that lacked an official flag ( e.g. 
  the roman empire ) . 
  * each comic gets transcribed and posted to a wiki so that people can find the comic by searching for its text . 
  * each comic has a flag legend at the end for those who do n't know 'em . 
   usa is at home playing video games and eating pizza while his gf canada is on ` vacation ' an ocean away , hooking up with france at the nightclub so she can knock out `` romance in paris '' off her bucket list . 
  pretty sure that 's reserved for belgium . 
  i 'm not sure what that means . 
  in the long run , there will be a trade equilibrium . 
  normally , because of [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) it is advantageous to countries to engage in trade . 
  just as some of your businesses will be replaced by overseas competition , so will your export industries grow . 
  iirc the us rules are identical or almost identical to canada 's . 
   ttip 's trojan horse i thought that the opposition to ttip is on its mechanics . 
  i heard a lot about negotiation practices and dispute resolution practices . 
  is it simply that you do n't want to compete ? 
  right , then . 
  carry on . 
  / u/gau8 _ brrrt , a number of countries and factions near the eu do n't appear to have gotten the memo and are enthusiastically fighting for said lines . 
  think clark kent and superman . 
  hollande likes to keep it on the down-low . 
  actually , paging / u/savannajeff to see if he knows , since i 've spoken with him about dumping policy in trade agreements and i bet that agricultural subsidies are an issue there . 
  just a few points : [ the eu ] ( http://farmsubsidy.openspending.org/ ) appears to currently have agricultural subsidies ( $ 59 billion/year at the eu level , dunno about at the country level ) that are over three times that of [ the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agricultural_subsidy#united_states ) ( $ 20 billion/year ) . 
  as i understand it , us agricultural subsidies are largely a result of the fact that farming states have disproportional representation in the senate , and so farmers can effectively swap political clout for cash . 
  in the eu , i suspect that it 's that many countries still have many small-scale farms with low-income workers who have relatively-cheap political influence to be bought . 
  these may be inefficient , but i do n't think that either represents predatory pricing in the sense that either the us or the eu is attempting to drive under competing industries in other countries via their size . 
  farming , particularly of things like grain where production can be rapidly and fluidly ramped up or down , so this would be a poor area for that . 
  they 're due to internal selling of political influence within the respective organizations . 
  from the standpoint of another country , they are n't particularly disadvantageous , though they might mean that it makes sense to establish national reserves of , say , flour or lard or whatever is being subsidized if there 's a risk of volatility . 
  those countries are effectively enjoying a wealth transfer from the subsidizing countries . 
  [ one more checkbox checked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_with_mcdonald%27s_restaurants ) . 
  damn , multilingual countries are complicated . 
  as of 2015 , your annual net migration rate was 2.54 per thousand residents . 
  ours was 3.86 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_net_migration_rate that does n't include illegal immigration , but brexit does n't address that and our rate is much higher there too . 
  zero interest is really a psychological barrier ... hell , what counts in real terms is beating inflation in the currency you chose to hold your savings in , even then . 
  arguably it 's inefficient not to negotiate on tax rate . 
  some companies will be more-willing to leave than others . 
  the age of free trade liberalism has passed . 
  ceta , ttip and now any post-brexit trade deal will be under close scrutiny . 
  the eu can do whatever it wants , but the rest of the world , including the us , is likely going to be increasing international trade . 
  i think that the economic benefits of doing so will become an increasingly-appealing siren song the greater the disparity . 
  britain 's economic influence is spread very thin among member nations . 
  it 's biggest trade partner is the us at 15 % , the second biggest trade partner is germany at 10 % who manages to stay competitive worldwide despite having to compete with the us and china , the third is switzerland with 7 % who is n't part of the eu , and after that everyone is bellow 6 % . 
  so if all trade stops , all of it , that 's just a 6 % economic hit per country at worst for most of the eu . 
  yeah . 
  wo n't all stop being traded , though . 
  there is nothing britain makes that can not be made on the continent , thus increasing jobs . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk3ruaprqzk reminds me of milton friedman making a * reductio ad absurdum * over bananas in hothouses and protectionism . 
   also , gravity models suggest there is nothing britain can do to prevent eu goods to remain competitive in britain short of embargo . 
  why would the uk care that they 're competitive ?
