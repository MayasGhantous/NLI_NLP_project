   yeah , it 's becoming increasingly hard actually to remind myself to distinguish between `` putin 's russia '' and `` russia '' . 
  well , putin 's policies , while aggravating to other countries , are probably hurting russians more than anyone else other than maybe ukrainians . 
   this is n't the alternative history forum is it ? 
  my bad . 
  i dunno , i think that / r/europe could make a pretty good alternative history timeline for europe , sanitizing everything . 
  i think that my post whooshed over the head of most people reading it . 
   usa was born in fast food , molded by deep frying . 
  they did n't see a salad until the scales were already over capacity . 
  yes , another amerifat joke . 
  hillarious . 
  dude , we have a rich culinary tradition . 
  we invented all kinds of salads : * [ ambrosia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ambrosia_%28fruit_salad%29 ) : pineapple/oranges/marshmallow / maraschino cherry/pudding/whipped cream salad . 
  * [ caesar salad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caesar_salad ) : croutons , parmesan cheese , olive oil , and egg with lettuce . 
  * [ chef salad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chef_salad ) : roast beef and cheese with lettuce . 
  * [ cobb salad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cobb_salad ) : bacon , chicken , egg , avocado , blue cheese with lettuce . 
  * [ cookie salad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cookie_salad ) : buttermilk , vanilla pudding , whipped cream , mandarin oranges , fudge shortbread .

  * [ taco salad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taco_salad ) : fried shell with lettuce , cheddar cheese , sour cream , guacamole , ground beef , chicken , and refried beans . 
  some of the [ most prominent americans ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/728297587418247168?lang=en ) love this dish . 
  that 's to say nothing of the fact that we 've developed a number of salad dressings : * [ french dressing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_dressing ) : sugar/ketchup/oil-based dressing * [ ranch salad dressing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ranch_dressing ) , a buttermilk/mayonaise dressing . 
  * [ russian dressing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_dressing ) , a mayo and ketchup dressing . 
  * [ thousand island dressing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thousand_island_dressing ) : mayo and olive-oil based dressing . 
  a lot of countries out there use the same three colors . 
  russia , france , the netherlands , the uk , etc. 
   russia has been blamed for all deadly sins . 
  ah , had n't been following that . 
  fair enough , good to hear . 
  i assume that egypt was able to negotiate a substantial discount , though . 
  the us ? 
  hmm ... i guess you mean abortion clinic bombings ? 
  i 'm not straw-manning . 
  that 's what the implication is . 
  he could have said something about a greater * degree * , but he chose to use the binary terminology , not me . 
  if it falls far enough to significantly reduce british wealth , it will also limit immigration . 
  i think that airbus ' response was both more diplomatic and more likely to accomplish anything in french interests than yours . 
  also , i was n't even aware that poland was objecting to the mistrals . 
  i know that the us was complaining bitterly about it , and i suspect that those two were n't the only ones . 
  maybe france should n't have been the only country to bear the cost . 
  i was somewhat sympathetic to the idea of having the eu buy them . 
  but this is the second post i 've seen presenting the mistral cancellation as catering to a polish whim . 
  i think that it was probably a real eu interest as well . 
  http://www.x-rates.com/graph/?from=pln&amp;to=eur&amp;amount=1 the zloty has actually been strong relative to the euro recently . 
  lockheed martin sells lm aircraft , not us mercenary services . 
  this seems like an expensive and uncertain way to go about this . 
  need to put [ farage and lepen 's faces in this classic political cartoon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:germany_gb_france.gif ), 
  ft is a brit publication ... you mean that this editorial only showed up in the online version and the print editions that went to the us ? 
   we can not build a `` united states of europe '' -- each country has its own history , language and culture . 
  prime minister of france does op-ed , says that us states do n't have history or culture , check . 
  the issues are all pretty resolved now , though . 
  * free trade agreement * customs union * single market * single market plus eurozone these are all forms of economic cooperation . 
  what sort of degree are you talking about ? 
  the roman empire . 
  < hopefully  `` the eu and the uk are both worthless . '', 
  * for never was a story of more woe * * than this of juliet and her romeo . 
  it appears to be safe-for-work , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  that 's remarkable . 
  i guess they mean well . 
  remnds me of kevin smith 's [ protest of * dogma * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-7dvf7euwy ) . 
  i guess halloween is big in poland . 
  according to wikipedia , he was never at mit . 
  correlation is not causation , though . 
  what about second gen ? 
  in north america , mexico still has a greater-than-replacement rate . 
  but historically , the ... ca n't remember if it 's second or third gen...mexican-americans fall down below replacement levels . 
  higher than other groups , but still dying off . 
  basically , nobody survives for long in a modern , developed society . 
  why ? 
  i mean , in what way would the netherlands be better off ? 
  the eu has added isds to its ftas with countries in the past to protect itself . 
  for anti-trade groups to seize on it in this particular agreement seems a bit curious . 
  1977 is when the fcpa was passed in the us -- it 's not an arbitrary date , so i would n't criticize that . 
  i agree with the rest of your points , though . 
  i rather expect that jp morgan is not a disinterested party in relative movements of currencies , on the other hand . 
  echelon 's wikipedia page does n't reference economic espionage . 
  yes , i do want something more than allegations even if snowden actually made this claim . 
  you made an assertion , i 'm saying that you have n't supported it . 
  as for protectionism , that might also be an interesting discussion , but that 's not what you claimed . 
  i still want you to back up your statement . 
  i was reading something about how the uk was talking about how its new legislation was more-stringent than the fcpa . 
   so i guess one reason that vw reacted as they did was because they know other makers were no better outside the us market . 
  ahhhhhh . 
  okay , that seems like a good insight . 
  i remember staring at it and trying to figure out how vw thought it was a good idea . 
  * the evidence was everywhere , on each car . 
  * upper management did n't isolate itself . 
  * there was no prospect of deniability . 
  * it was ongoing . 
  sooner or later , this was going to break open . 
  * it 's easy for your competitor 's engineers to discover . 
  they can whack you at their leisure . 
  but the `` it made sense in the eu , where vw expected to be able to deal with the fallout , and it was just migrated over '' makes more sense . 
  of the colonizers , the uk was probably the best one to be a colony of . 
  actually , i think that the point was that uber simply ignored lobbying and just started offering service . 
  i drive a car and i do n't get regular health checks to maintain my license ... but my car going put pf control would be about as dangerous to other people . 
  i 'm suspicious that the article got it wrong .
