  that 's got ta be a one-off cost , which would be on par with a permanent taxi license cost ( nyc was up near a million dollars per ) . 
  not per year . 
   the biggest spy operations worldwide are run by the americans and the british who have no hesitation whatsoever about using their intelligence gathering capabilities for industrial espionage abroad . 
  source , please . 
  gon na be honest -- i think that it 's a lot more likely that some local burglar stole the laptops than that the chinese government sent someone back to steal them . 
  laptop thefts from offices do happen -- they 're easy to sell and they 're relatively-valuable . 
  besides , if the chinese were hell-bent on industrial espionage ... i got ta be blunt , some guy 's wave generator idea is pretty low on the list of things with a return . 
  the value in intellectual property is the r&d that went into it . 
  why aim for some technology that was n't fully-developed and might never be profitable ? 
  well , yeah , but modern english is the result of pulling in lots of words from other languages . 
  that 's really not what he said . 
  he was criticizing some protest group for not holding russia to the same bar that it was holding the uk . 
  fair enough -- my issue was that mogurakun was claiming that it did happen . 
  cato is n't saying that this is being done . 
  they 're saying that it would be opposed to us interests were the us to begin doing so . 
  so , in places like north korea , [ family has been used as hostages , with the threat of collective punishments against them used to ensure good behavior ] ( https://www.nknews.org/2015/03/studying-abroad-with-your-family-held-hostage/ ) . 
  the soviet union , as i understand it , also restricted traveling abroad with family , though more benignly -- one 's family might not be punished , but one would not get to see one 's family again if one defected . 
  i assume that that 's what the concern would be over . 
  however , modern russia , whatever its flaws , is not north korea , not the ussr , and not a closed society . 
  you want to leave , you can do it . 
  further , i 'm very doubtful that russia is imminently likely to head that direction . 
  i am not familiar with the source . 
  can anyone speak as to its reputability ? 
    strengthen the use of intelligence services for economic means . 
    crazy ? 
  given how many times the us military contractor companies have used cia & nsa spies to screw european companies on bids to us govt , i 'm calling you on this . 
  how many times has this happened ? 
   russian propaganda has led many to believe that russia had no part in the mh17 case , and furthermore , that ukrainian aircraft were involved . 
  people in russia , okay , sure . 
  but , honestly , in the eu ... is there any country where a majority of people are blaming ukraine ? 
  i mean , i 'm not saying that it 's not worth also saying `` ukraine did n't shoot down mh17 '' in russia , but the article is talking about pressure targeting eu members :  propaganda pressure on the eu from russia and islamic terrorist organisations is growing , say foreign affairs committee meps in a resolution voted on monday . 
  it seeks to distort the truth , incite fear , provoke doubt and divide the eu . 
  also :  foreign affairs committee meps acknowledge that countering propaganda with propaganda is counterproductive . 
  positive messaging , awareness raising and education to increase information literacy in eu and to empower citizens to analyse media content critically , could be the way forward , meps add . 
  while i guess that `` propaganda '' has taken on a negative connotation of being false information , originally -- say , sixty years back -- it meant nothing more than material intended to politically-influence , whether it was true or false . 
  [ counterpropaganda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/counterpropaganda ) does n't imply that the material is false , for example . 
  < goes to look  hmm . 
  in the us case , siemens appears to have been subject because it became a us publicly-tradable company as well as just doing business in the us : http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/business/worldbusiness/16siemens.html?_r=0  officials at the justice department and at the s.e.c. , which also investigated the case , said that some siemens agents in the united states participated in the schemes . 
  but most of the transactions were in foreign countries . 
  company employees created off-the-books slush funds , used middlemen posing as consultants and delivered suitcases filled with cash to bribe foreign officials . 
    linda chatman thomsen , the head of the s.e.c. 's enforcement division , said that the company paid an estimated $ 1.4 billion in bribes to government officials in asia , africa , europe , the middle east and latin america . 
  she called the schemes `` unprecedented in scale and geographic reach . '' ** the united states claimed partial jurisdiction because siemens , once it became listed on the new york stock exchange in 2001 , was subject to american financial laws and regulations . 
  **   prosecutors in munich , whose work revealed the outlines of the bribery operation , also announced a deal with siemens that would cost the company 395 million euros ( $ 540 million ) . 
  that figure is in addition to $ 290 million levied by a munich court last year . 
  that is , the company as a whole , including overseas divisions , was operating as a us publicly-traded company . 
  i suppose maybe that 's what the article author meant -- certainly db is also traded on the nyse . 
  i do n't follow the banking situation the way some people here do , but two points stand out to me :  although foreign firms accounted for only 30 percent of investigations opened by u.s. authorities between 1977 and 2014 under its anti-foreign bribery law , 67 percent of the amount levied in fines came from foreign companies , the report said . 
  is there reason to believe that foreign corrupt practices act fines would be a flat distribution ? 
  i mean , this is going to involve two sets of companies : foreign companies engaging in bribery in the us and us companies engaging in bribery abroad . 
  i 'd vaguely imagine that it 's cheaper for a us multinational to bribe someone in nigeria than a german multinational to bribe people in the us . 
   but it did say the doj had not taken account of the impact on the financial system that the $ 14 billion fine it sought from the german bank went on to have . 
  that may be true , and i am sure that in germany , db made the `` too big to fail '' argument . 
  but this opens a pandora 's box : * generally-speaking , should the us exempt companies that are particularly large back home from fines ? 
  for example , nokia was big in finland . 
  as far as i know , nokia was always on the up-and-up . 
  but let 's say that they did get caught doing something illegal at a time when they were on the verge of going under . 
  should nokia say `` well , this would impact the finnish economy badly ... we should get a pass on the fines '' . 
  i mean , there are two hundred countries out there . 
  if each has , say , five critical companies , that 's a lot of `` too big to fail '' get-out-of-jail cards . 
  * any externality is predominantly in the eu . 
  while the us obviously extended special treatment to , say , gm and some financial companies , this was due to a domestic externality . 
  in situations like this , the taxpayer eats a cost to , at least in theory , internalize an externality to himself . 
  if db needs a bailout , having the the us taxpayer eat the cost by having fines dropped seems unreasonable , as he 's not the one predominantly benefiting . 
  he might have indirect benefit , i agree , but germany has already said that they are n't bailing out db , and surely any benefit to the state is greater in germany . 
  * the us has no authority in germany over the structure of the financial system . 
  it can not say `` db is large and thus a risk , so we will break it up to avoid risks to the german financial system '' . 
  nor would germany accept the us doing so . 
  if the us has no input on how db impacts financial stability , it does not seem reasonable to expect it to eat the costs , either -- it 's not as if the us made mistakes in letting db get where it was and could `` do something differently '' to avoid issues coming up next time . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_i  belligerents :   allied powers   central powers [ snip ]  the war drew in all the world 's economic great powers , [ 8 ] assembled in two opposing alliances : the allies ( based on the triple entente of the british empire , france and the russian empire ) versus the central powers of germany and austria-hungary . 
  no , but i 'm not claiming that it is . 
  that is not the case in the us -- the median boomer is no millionaire . 
  https://dqydj.com/net-worth-by-age-calculator-for-the-united-states/  a household led by a 60-64 year old with a net worth of $ 1,000,000 was in net worth gentile 85 % in 2013 . 
  median household net worth for that age range appears to be about $ 180k . 
  the country with the highest median adult net wealth in [ this table ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult ) is australia . 
  in australia , that 's $ 225,337 ( note that this is per adult , not household ) . 
  that 's not for boomers , but i could n't pull up a median boomer statistic , or for households . 
  http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/lookup/by%20subject/6523.0~2013-14~main%20features~income%20and%20wealth%20distribution~6 this is n't for the boomer age cohort and is in australian dollars ( about 1.3 to one usd ) and many of the numbers are mean , not median ( which will be higher due to the distribution ) :  similarly , while the mean wealth of all households in australia in 2013 -- 14 was $ 809,900 , the median was much lower at $ 461,500 . 
  as shown in graph 3 , there is greater inequality in the net worth distribution . 
  the 20 % of households with the lowest net worth had a mean net worth of $ 35,600 . 
  of these , 93,800 households had negative wealth . 
  in comparison , the 20 % of households with the highest net worth had a mean net worth of $ 2,514,300 . 
  that 's getting there . 
  i 'd still guess that it 's substantially-lower , though we ca n't separate boomer data . 
  however , australia is also top of the charts here -- not representative of the west . 
  at least in usd , i think that it is safe to say that the median boomer household in the west is not a millionaire . 
  if that was your view , you 've probably got a skewed image . 
  france fell june 25,1940 . 
  but canada declared war september 10 , 1939 . 
  i get an article with a very different title at the link . 
  that 's not really a significant issue in the cuban missile crisis relative to the blockade ne quarantine in the first place . 
  yeah , we ran all through the last seventy years to lead up to this one glorious moment where we take down the eu by fining a bank that broke the law -- or more specifically , taking over twelve months to do so . 
  curses , our plot is foiled !, 
  the allies invaded russia , though , after it collapsed , to variously try to support the white russian forces or to protect personnel or military supplies associated with the now-collapsed war effort . 
  the us forces : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polar_bear_expedition https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_expeditionary_force_siberia, 
  this is not going to be a good long-term solution . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heritability_of_iq  the general figure for the heritability of iq , according to an authoritative american psychological association report , is 0.45 for children , and rises to around 0.75 for late teens and adults . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] the heritability of iq increases with age and reaches an asymptote at 18 -- 20 years of age and continues at that level well into adulthood . 
  [ 7 ] recent studies suggest that family and parenting characteristics are not significant contributors to variation in iq scores ; [ 8 ] however , poor prenatal environment , malnutrition and disease can have deleterious effects . 
   by choosing a scientific career one already agrees that money * for yourself * is 2nd-3rd priority , and being able to do science is the 1st .
