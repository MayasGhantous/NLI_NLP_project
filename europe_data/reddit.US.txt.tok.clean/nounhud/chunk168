  i dunno what his current salary is , but glassdoor says that that his title at that lab runs about about $ 143k/year , which is well above us median personal income of $ 30k . 
  i understand that physicists do comparatively-well as scientists go . 
  payscale says that a us anthropologist , a [ field of science with a relatively low pay for a phd holder ] ( http://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/college/t012-s001-worst-college-majors-for-your-career-2016-2017/index.html ) , has median pay of $ 50k ( though , granted , one also has to get the slot ) . 
  so that probably vaguely-describes a fair chunk of the range . 
  neither of these strikes me quite as an ascetic life compared to the bulk of the population . 
  if i were wanting to run a nationalist party , i imagine that i 'd say something like that too . 
  if you 're serious about it , you can swap batteries instead of recharging . 
  probably want to automate it if you get sufficient scale ( i.e. 
  pull up , the car pops its hood , and an overhead gantry drops it in ), 
  well , some members , like germany , want access to a seat . 
  if the eu federalizes , they 'll have that . 
   russian 's should just bring the b52 equivalents https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tupolev_tu-95, 
  a prison break ? 
  i would n't think so . 
  [ this incident involving a helicopter was the year after 9/11 ] ( http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20021230&amp;slug=webhijack30 ) , and it was n't described as domestic terrorism . 
  the incident here in germany [ seemed pretty minor ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/right-wing-demonstrators-attack-police-station-in-magdeburg/a-36001947 ) :  eleven of the man 's associates tried to get to the arrested man but were pushed back by police before being expelled from the station . 
  [ in virginia , for example ] ( http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t16c009.php ) :  ( b ) it is unlawful for a person to forcibly rescue a prisoner held in custody . 
    ( c ) a person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a :   ( 1 ) felony and , upon conviction , must be imprisoned not more than ten years ;   ( 2 ) misdemeanor and , upon conviction , must be imprisoned not more than two years or fined not more than five hundred dollars if the person whose escape or rescue was effected or intended was charged with a noncapital offense . 
  india and pakistan do n't have second-strike capabilities . 
  both are vulnerable to a first strike . 
   i am also positive that both germany and japan would have the know how and materials to build nuclear weapons . 
  probably . 
  i mean , i would imagine that many countries might theoretically have the ability to do so . 
  i do n't know what the dividing line is , but i can guess . 
  every country on the list has the ability to provide a nuclear [ second strike ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_strike ) against any country in the world . 
  there is n't a perfectly-reliable way for any one country to knock out any of the others without suffering serious costs . 
  ( india has limited second-strike capabilities , but could n't hit , say , the us . ), 
  but , for most intents and purposes , every country on that list can not act without any of the other countries representing the possibility of massive losses to it . 
  also , since i assume that the subtext here is `` france and the uk are on the list , and germany 's not that far behind ... why not germany ? 
  '' : any shakeup to reflect current global military capabilities would probably be disadvantageous to europe , given that europe has become proportionally-weaker militarily . 
  expanding the size of the unsc to increase granularity wo n't answer that -- no members have any incentive to expand the set of countries involved unless there 's a real military capability from them to represent an existential threat . 
  you federalize the eu , there 'll be the eu 's seat , though . 
  yet . 
  those few decades down the line , though ? 
  more information can make the processing easier . 
  why should n't they be proud of finding it ? 
  we cover joan of arc too . 
  [ example textbook ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bzrjiivdbsokuu9lqzzydvfwzxc/edit ) . 
  i think that it 's more of a social engineering effort that because of her personal importance -- she 's a female leader who took on a male role in history . 
  [ sacagawea ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sacagawea ) also gets disproportonate coverage relative to her role . 
  i 'm not following . 
  you 're saying that drones are the future ? 
  the uk had somewhere to fall back to . 
  both the uk and france lost the battle of france . 
  france did n't have that luxury . 
  they got only one strike . 
  pretty much everyone got cut up by germany at their first try in world war ii -- the us at [ kasserine pass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kasserine_pass ) , france and the uk in the battle of france , the ussr in the beginning of operation barbarossa . 
  thanks !, 
   people seem to be forgetting that the eu is the biggest trading bloc on the planet err , not to detract from your broader point , but at the moment nafta is larger . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trade_bloc [ the eu is $ 16.220 t ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union ) [ nafta is $ 20.162 t ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement ) if tpp goes through , it will become largest , at $ 27.5 t. 
  if ttip goes through , it will be the largest , at $ 34t . 
  i 'd believe it , but i still think that it 's bad politics from an eu standpoint for eu members , even if one is leavimg , to take publicly-hostile positions . 
  might be good at the national level , but that 's what produced brexit , yes ? 
  you want to negotiate hardball in private , hey , that 's another story . 
  if you count aristocratic titles as part of the name :  elizabeth ii , by the grace of god , of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and of her other realms and territories queen , head of the commonwealth , defender of the faith [ 2 ] i suspect that other european royalty could also make it . 
    it is better off than its neighbors   it 's not . 
  life standards is comparable with belarus , russia and ukraine . 
  might be specific to the region of poland . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index has the following ranks : poland : 36 belarus : 50 russia : 50 ukraine : 81 that being said , i agree that convergence is disappointingly slow . 
   btw , if you think france would fight for poland if russia invaded then you 're delusional . 
  they would find a way to squirm out of the a5 . 
  it would be america that would be doing the heavy lifting , as always . 
  thanks , but what are you basing the idea that france would n't fight on ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steam_aircraft  * 1861 gustave ponton d'am\u00e9court made a small steam powered craft coining the name helicopter . 
    * 1877 : enrico forlanini built and flew a model steam powered helicopter in milan . 
   just to please poland i think that the mistrals cancellation was probably also a `` good of the eu '' issue , though . 
  and i know that the us was also also complaining about setting russia up with the mistrals , and i would n't have been surprised if there were other voices . 
  now , i do think that there 's some argument that it should n't have just been france to eat the cost , but i do n't think that you can reduce it to satisfying polish whims either . 
  if they all sell at once , there will be a crash in the market value of those residences . 
  i do n't see a skilled labor connotation with ` expat ' here . 
  however , emmigration is expected to be permanent , but being an expat may not . 
  it 's possible that skilled labor more-frequently tends to move temporarily . 
  why is he personally so important to the coalition ? 
  is there some european language where `` lybia '' is the correct spelling for the country with the english name `` libya '' ? 
  i see this a lot on this sub . 
  any source other than zerohedge ? 
  you mean twitter or erdogan making the order ? 
  if the former , how would you feel if the dutch government ordered a big us multinational to do something and the mnc told the government to piss off ? 
  thanks , but i 've got no idea what :  the police officer emphasized that prisoner exemption was not a cavalier 's doom . 
  ... means . 
  you could maybe create a torpedo that throws cable out to foul the prop . 
  assuming ( and that may not be a valid assumption ) that the forces involved did n't sink the submarine , it would have to blow its tanks and come to the surface . 
  honestly , that might not be a bad less-lethal option for surface ships too . 
  we 've done the `` practice depth charge '' thing too . 
  sometimes it does n't work as smoothly as one might think . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasili_arkhipov  on 27 october 1962 , during the cuban missile crisis , a group of eleven united states navy destroyers and the aircraft carrier uss randolph located the diesel-powered nuclear-armed soviet foxtrot-class submarine b-59 near cuba . 
  despite being in international waters , the americans started dropping practice signaling depth charges , explosives intended to force the submarine to come to the surface for identification . 
  there had been no contact from moscow for a number of days and , although the submarine 's crew had earlier been picking up u.s. civilian radio broadcasts , once b-59 began attempting to hide from its u.s. navy pursuers , it was too deep to monitor any radio traffic . 
  those on board did not know whether war had broken out or not . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] the captain of the submarine , valentin grigorievitch savitsky , decided that a war might already have started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo . 
  [ 7 ]   unlike the other subs in the flotilla , three officers on board the b-59 had to agree unanimously to authorize a nuclear launch : captain savitsky , the political officer ivan semonovich maslennikov , and the second-in-command arkhipov . 
  typically , russian submarines armed with the `` special weapon '' only required the captain to get authorization from the political officer to launch a nuclear torpedo . 
  however , due to arkhipov 's position as flotilla commander , the b-59 's captain also was required to gain arkhipov 's approval . 
  an argument broke out , with only arkhipov against the launch . 
  [ 8 ]   even though arkhipov was only second-in-command of the submarine b-59 , he was in fact commander of the entire submarine flotilla , including the b-4 , b-36 and b-130 , and equal in rank to captain savitsky . 
  according to author edward wilson , the reputation arkhipov had gained from his courageous conduct in the previous year 's soviet submarine k-19 incident also helped him prevail . 
  [ 7 ] arkhipov eventually persuaded savitsky to surface and await orders from moscow . 
  this effectively averted the nuclear warfare which probably would have ensued if the nuclear weapon had been fired . 
  [ 9 ] the submarine 's batteries had run very low and the air-conditioning had failed , so it was forced to surface amidst its u.s. pursuers and head home . 
  [ 10 ] washington 's message that practice depth charges were being used to signal the submarine to surface never reached b-59 , and moscow claims it has no record of receiving it either .
