  a couple points . 
  first , in some cases , the population of some countries is arguably already over the carrying capacity of the country . 
  that 's why you have famine and food aid going out . 
  second , population growth is a larger factor than climate change , though i agree that there will be stresses on agriculture there too . 
  third , the `` gun people down at the border or take them in '' business is something of a false dichotomy . 
  obviously there are intermediate responses , and if it got bad enough that none of the other options were viable ( detention facilities , etc ) my guess is that would-be border-crossers would simply be unceremoniously dumped back in the country in question . 
  it 'd be bad news for the people in question -- they 'd still be facing bad odds -- but we 've already not intervened in wars , famines , and other disasters , and i doubt that the political bar to doing that is drastically higher than the bar to simply looking the other direction . 
  if need be , probably ways to politically-soften things , like giving each deported person a month of food or something . 
  you might consider it morally equal to gunning people down , but i bet that the political bar is a lot lower . 
  i believe that you 're a brit , right ? 
  the brits successfully did this and more just a hundred-and-fifty years ago during the irish famine ... and the irish and the british have a far-closer history than do , say , the netherlands and chad . 
  hell , the brits just closed the gates for what is in my opinion vastly-less problematic immigration than that would be . 
  nah , i think that mandatory return could be sold to the european public in such a scenario . 
  what a one-vote-per-country organization that asserted universal jurisdiction would look like the first time it tried to tell any of the major world powers that they were to be punished for doing something : https://youtube.com/watch?v=9clcmr58lv8, 
  regular votes in countries reflect approximately equivalent ability to exert force . 
  that is , if we have a dispute and it grows into a civil war , both you and i can pick up a rifle or whatever . 
  given that that would be costly and destructive , best to model what would happen in a civil war , pretend that we had it , and have the results reflect that . 
  we can avoid the whole civil war business . 
  the unsc is doing the same thing . 
  i think that it 's doing it well , as there have been no wars directly between the major powers since it was set up . 
  there 's no approximate all-are-equal military between countries the way there is citizens in a country -- ergo , no `` one country , one vote '' on the unsc . 
  frankly , even if that is the case , i do n't think that you 're going to sell most people in the eu on taking in hundreds of millions of people from the worst-off countries in africa . 
  i know that you could n't sell people in the us on it . 
  while the term ` dumping ' has occasionally been used when . 
  * probably * the only real issue is domestic industry having higher prices , ` dumping ' technically refers to selling at a loss for the seller . 
  it 's a good bet that the seller is n't actually losing here . 
  yup , fixed , thanks . 
  if you want to split the us up into states in the country gdp list ( an unusual view ... split up the us rather than combine the eu ) , it goes : | country | nominal gdp ( millions of dollars ) | | - | - :| | china | $ 11,391,619 | | japan | $ 4,730,300 | | germany | $ 3,494,900 | | united kingdom | $ 2,649,890 | | france | $ 2,488,280 | | california | $ 2,448,467 | | india | $ 2,250,990 | | italy | $ 1,852,500 | | brazil | $ 1,769,600 | | texas | $ 1,639,375 | | canada | $ 1,532,340 | | new york | $ 1,455,568 | | south korea | $ 1,404,380 | | ** russia ** | ** $ 1,267,750 ** | | australia | $ 1,267,750 | | spain | $ 1,252,160 | | mexico | $ 1,063,610 |, 
  does not have the literal text `` russia denies '' in the title , a requirement of that sub . 
  they 're his parents , man . 
  i wonder what it would have been like if the internet was around and big then . 
  probably would have just wound up with two disconnected networks , i guess . 
  the `` side '' you joined would dictate the network your country was on . 
  [ that 's not quite everything ] ( https://imgur.com/ff4wg64?r ) . 
  i hate to say it , but trump would be four to eight years . 
  brexit will probably be longer . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_estonia  estonia , historically a lutheran area , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] is one of the `` least religious '' countries in world in terms of declared attitudes , with only 14 % of the population declaring religion an important part of their daily life . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sport_in_japan ) : ( not sure what the percent is of , and the source is japanese ) | professional sport | favorite of percent | | - | - | | baseball | 48.4 | | soccer | 36.0 | | golf | 16.0 | | sumo | 15.8 | | boxing | 7.8 | | motor racing | 7.0 | | puroresu | 3.5 | | other | 7.8 |, 
  the relevant factor here is clearly the amount of time that we 're seen on here . 
  we are n't being noticed enough to be loved . 
  that means we need to make a greater effort to post more and be higher-profile in the future . 
  that was , i think , expected , but it 's important to get that out explicitly . 
  people need to make life plans without being left with unnecessary uncertainty . 
  i think that lvirus may just be trolling to get a rise our of people ... 
  not fining them will be erode the stability of the us financial system . 
  i do n't realistically see a good alternative . 
  some people might like jail time for a lot of people , but that creates its own issues and leaves a hole for scapegoating . 
  eh , there 's a process . 
  you do n't follow it , hard to complain about others not doing so . 
  russia 's in europe , though not in the eu , and trying to pull a watergate on a us election is a pretty big deal . 
   a man will look at a women and his brain will instinctively evaluate her potentional fertility based on her looks without even actively realizing that he 's doing it . 
  what he thinks he 's doing is thinking whether she 's attractive or not . 
  what his brain is actually doing is judging whether she can carry a healthy baby . 
  http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/blogs/babies-cute-explained.htm my favorite `` old biological explanation for some not obviously related mental quirk '' thing is why we mentally latch onto some things as cute -- because they trip low-level triggers that we evolved to protect our own babies . 
  to be fair , some ethnic enclaves have diffused . 
  for a first-gen immigrant , having services and products available in your native tongue is practical . 
  i agree that they do n't always do so , that there 's more to it than that . 
  just want to point out that some of that is temporary . 
  i seriously question the merits of this -- seems protectionist . 
  i think that establishing internationally-recognized medical certification would be worthwhile . 
  would n't a devout christian place god 's laws over those of the state ? 
  i 'm not totally sure whether he still has us citizenship . 
  he might have renounced it around becoming prime minister -- i 'm not sure if the uk lets its prime ministers also be us citizens , and [ according to this link ] ( https://www.quora.com/did-boris-johnson-actually-renounce-his-us-citizenship-as-he-promised ) , it looks like the us may not let its citizens hold certain positions in the uk . 
  the uk requires an oath to be sworn for some positions :  oath of allegiance and official oath   main article : oath of allegiance ( united kingdom )   a general oath of allegiance and official oath , are set out in the promissory oaths act 1868 are required to be taken by various office-holders . 
    members of the house of commons or of the house of lords are required to take the oath of allegiance in the house at the beginning of a new parliament , as well as after a demise of the crown . 
    section 84 of the scotland act 1998 requires members of the scottish parliament to take the oath of allegiance at a meeting of the parliament . 
  members of the scottish executive and junior scottish ministers are additionally required to take the official oath . 
    section 20 of the government of wales act 1998 requires members of the national assembly for wales to take the oath of allegiance . 
  a welsh form of the oath is prescribed by the national assembly for wales ( oath of allegiance in welsh ) order 1999 . 
  [ 59 ]   oath of allegiance   the oath of allegiance is in the following form :    i , ( name ) , do swear that i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to her majesty queen elizabeth , her heirs and successors , according to law . 
  so help me god . 
    official oath   the official oath is in the following form :    i , ( name ) , do swear that i will well and truly serve her majesty queen elizabeth in the office of ( office ) . 
  so help me god . 
  and the [ restriction in question in us federal code ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1481 ) :  a person who is a national of the united states whether by birth or naturalization , shall lose his nationality by voluntarily performing any of the following acts with the intention of relinquishing united states nationality -- [ snip ]  ( 4 ) ( b ) accepting , serving in , or performing the duties of any office , post , or employment under the government of a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof , after attaining the age of eighteen years for which office , post , or employment an oath , affirmation , or declaration of allegiance is required ; or that being said , i also know that the us supreme court has , as of [ * afroyim v. rusk * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afroyim_v._rusk ) , greatly narrowed what constitutes `` voluntary relinquishing '' of citizenship , and based on the first link in my post , he does n't appear to have officially registered his giving up us citizenship , though he claimed that he was going to do so when he was heading towards the prime minister 's office . 
  so , boris may still hold dual citizenship . 
   but now what has been done can not be undone . 
  well , it could be , but it should n't be via people ordered to undergo the process trying to punch holes in it from the bureaucracy . 
  i do n't think that brexit is a good idea -- but if you 're going to do it , people on both sides should be choosing people who are going to do their job to the best of their abilities . 
  hahaha , i bet that pronouncing the last is a pain . 
  according to the wikipedia article , we 've got a comparable code , but it 's shorter :  rel < country code ( s )  : distribution to citizens of the countries listed is permitted , providing they have appropriate accesses and need to know . 
  example : `` rel to usa , aus , gbr , can , nzl '' indicates that the information may be shared with appropriate personnel from australia , the united kingdom , canada , and new zealand . 
    * fvey is the country code used as shorthand for the five eyes . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shelling_of_mainila finland did not start the winter war . 
  he 's talking about priests being chaste , not believers . 
  after the cleansing nuclear fires have washed away the unbelievers , the righteous shall emerge and repopulate the land . 
  similar thing for violating laws of judaism . 
  i do n't think that smelling cooking pork is a violation of islam . 
  they do n't shun all form of interaction with the stuff . 
  it 's not like romanians and garlic , say . 
  it 's an imperfect tool , but the process is a statistical one . 
  it 's not expected to be a 100 % rate . 
  we have a noforn ( no foreign nationals ) status for some [ classified information ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/classified_information_in_the_united_states ) :  also , the statement of noforn ( meaning `` no foreign nationals '' ) is applied to any information that may not be released to any non-u.s. citizen . 
  noforn and distribution statements are often used in conjunction with classified information or alone on sbu information . 
  given that this cuts to the core of identity and state loyalty , awkward as it is , it probably makes sense . 
  my guess is that other eu members wo n't have brits on their own brexit teams , even though brits will keep working in all other areas . 
  does n't work like that . 
  the debt is denominated in a different currency . 
  that 's an interesting factoid . 
  well ... to be fair , without the euro , they would n't have had the ability to dig themselves so deep . 
  i believe that it is patent , not copyright , used to protect genetically-engineered life .
