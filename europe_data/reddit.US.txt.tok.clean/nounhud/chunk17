  turned out to have been a correct gamble . 
  conclusion , which has the rationale :  the policy of international law , roe and navy regulations is to discourage on-scene commanders from starting wars which nobody wants-from shooting first in peacetime-unless the survival of their ships or aircraft depends upon it . 
  according to o'connell , the basic assumption is that naval force , when used , `` will be progressively applied to achieve or defeat political goals without resulting in hostilities ; that if hostilities do occur they can be brought to a successful termination without progression to another mode of warfare or to other areas of conflict . 
  intrinsic to this assumption is the requirement , to put it simply , that the other side fires first , for then the use of force can be presented as self-defense . 
  the rules of the game require that the burden [ of shooting first ] be shifted , if possible , to the other side in the event of a confrontation of warships , or at least that the opening of fire be necessary to enforce the law . 
    but modern technology can make taking the first hit lethal . 
  yet the rule against shooting first remains on the books . 
  and u.s. experience with the exceptions to the rule should convince any reader that a successful political justification for using force is extraordinarily difficult except when based upon self-defense or law enforcement , as o'connell says . 
  it is therefore not surprising that the only justification for shooting first given the on-scene commander by typical peacetime general roe is anticipatory self-defense of his unit . 
    modern technology assists him in determining the imminence of an attack on his unit-just as it makes his adversary 's weapons come further , faster , more accurately and more destructively , toward him . 
  in the end , the high standard given by daniel webster is useful to have in mind even if it must be interpreted in light of modern technology : anticipatory self-defense should be confined to cases in which the necessity is `` instant , overwhelming and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation . '', 
    this raises a difficult question with which i will conclude this paper : should the united states avoid shooting first ( with the exceptions of self-defense and law enforcement ) whether or not the soviet union and other hostile states regularly do so ? 
  my answer is yes , for the following reasons :   * the rule against first use of force is based on long-held western values and diplomatic goals . 
  when our allies perceive us as departing from the rule , we are likely to lose their support , at least temporarily-as we did in grenada . 
  in the long run , we may consider the strength of our alliances to be more important to our security than exercising the freedom to flout the rule . 
    * a long-term u.s. diplomatic goal is , to quote woodrow wilson , `` to make the world safe for democracy . 
  democracies can not flourish as well in a lawless , `` might-makes-right '' world . 
  to sustain support for our leadership in the direction of a world which respects the rule of law , we need to comply ourselves . 
    * the rule against first use of force probably still has some deterrent effect , though that is difficult to prove . 
  states never say : `` but for the rule we would have committed aggression . '', 
  because we hear about interventions in violation of the rule , we tend to conclude it no longer deters aggression . 
  even if the rule lacks deterrent effect , however , it clearly helps justify mobilization at home and assistance from aboard when using force in self-defense against a clear , armed attack-as the british found in the falklands conflict . 
    * it is hard to conceive a scenario in which the rule would prevent us from protecting our vital interests . 
  it is not inflexible , as the creativity of american precedents suggests . 
    * the rule 's opposition to aggression means that it generally favors the status quo . 
  we have become a status quo power . 
  we usually support the existing territorial and political integrity of nation states . 
  we usually urge the peaceful settlement of disputes . 
  in these respects , the rule serves our foreign policy goals more often , probably , than those of the soviet union . 
    * since world war ii , the rule has been part of a broader effort to prevent hostilities of a sort which might escalate to a third world war and a nuclear exchange . 
  that effort continues to be essential . 
  introduction :  because one missile may sink a ship , naval officers often ask : i know i can use force in self-defense if my ship is actually attacked . 
  * but do i have to take the first hit ? 
  *   this paper discusses how international law , navy regulations and naval rules of engagement ( roe ) answer this question for the on-scene commander . 
  it also deals with the more general question sometimes asked by the president and other national command authorities : are there circumstances when the united states may use force first ? 
    in general , international law , navy regulations and roe permit the use of force in peacetime only in self-defense . 
  their policy is to restrain aggression , to prevent the outbreak of hostilities , and to limit escalation if shooting starts . 
  there are , however , a few circumstances where shooting first is permitted . 
    ** first ** , navy regulations and typical peacetime roe authorize an on-scene commander to shoot first when necessary for * anticipatory * self-defense of forces under his command-for example , to shoot a kamikaze aircraft diving on a ship in time to ward off the blow . 
  this is called * unit * self-defense . 
    ** second ** , shooting first may be specifically authorized by higher command in a few other cases , including :   * when necessary for anticipatory self-defense of * other * u.s. forces , citizens or territory ( `` national '' self-defense ) ;   * when authorized by the united nations or a regional collective security agency to deal with a threat to the peace ;   * to protect americans in danger in foreign territory because , for example , of an internal insurgency or civil war ; or   * at the request of an established government to help put down an insurgency within its territory . 
    ** third ** , force may of course be used first when necessary for * law enforcement * in internal and territorial waters and occasionally in international waters . 
  most pilots are probably not suicidal enough to actually kill themselves . 
  also , russia very probably does not want to actually start a shooting war .

  '' ] ( https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/39633f23-6a8d-49dd-ba5f-4af2aa700ba0/international-law-and-the-use-of-force-in-peacetim.aspx ) , george bunn the paper is twelve pages and goes into detail , but here 's the introduction and conclusion , which have both a summary and rationale . 
  as pertains to this incident , i 'd say `` yes , this would fall within the purview of anticipatory unit self-defense as described in the paper if the unit commander thought that the plane would actually collide , but he should as far as possible extend the benefit of the doubt '' . 
  certainly the russian pilot * did * run the risk of that judgment call being made the other way , but the commander here clearly knew that the aircraft was coming ( hence the camera and people watching ) and chose not to shoot it -- which turned out to have worked out well . 
   that means fences [ pretty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hadrian%27s_wall ) sure [ that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anastasian_wall ) europe 's [ got ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hexamilion_wall ) this [ whole ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serpent%27s_wall ) wall [ thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trajan%27s_wall ) pretty [ well ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_wall ) figured [ out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/offa%27s_dyke ) . 
  we probably come in first , but , uk , i bet that you come in second , even if we only count world war ii . 
  and [ italy was pretty important in selling the idea of bombing civilians to both of us back then ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giulio_douhet ) ... 
  i guess what i 'm getting at is that my belief is that had the su-24 turned abruptly , i 'm skeptical that anything would have stopped it from crashing into the ship . 
  i was just responding to :  if the ships aegis combat system detected a collision course the su-24 would 've been shot down . 
  i agree that it is certainly * capable * of being configured such that the su-24 could not have gotten anywhere near it -- my point is just that as it was configured , my guess is that the su-24 could have crashed into it , given that we know that it got as close as it did . 
  i am no expert on the system , but i would be surprised if a [ phalanx ciws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phalanx_ciws ) would let anything fly within 75 ' of the ship if it is active . 
  their range runs out to over two miles , and i can not imagine that the designers ever intended it to let something get within 75 ' . 
  that has to be about at the physical limits of what the gun could do , even assuming it was already aligned to follow the target -- a fighter jet might be going at hundreds of miles an hour , and even once the projectile has been accelerated from zero to muzzle velocity of < checks  2000 mph , it 's going to let the target cover a not-insignificant amount of distance as the projectile comes up . 
  besides , a missile does n't need to actually contact the ship to do damage . 
  i 'd guess that the thing is probably not active , particularly given that they were doing air operations at the time . 
  for all i know , they might not even be active for day-to-day peacetime life at sea -- more risk of shooting something that they should n't than shooting something that they should . 
   to demonstrate the danger the jets posed to the ship that being said , if they collide at a couple hundred miles an hour , my money is on the destroyer . 
   fighter jets an [ su-24 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sukhoi_su-24 ) is n't a [ fighter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fighter_aircraft ) ( an aircraft designed to attack other aircraft ) , but rather an [ attack aircraft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attack_aircraft ) ( an aircraft designed to attack targets on the surface ) . 
   it might be a shocker to some but there are russian spies everywhere maybe so , but most of them are presumably spying , not assassinating people . 
  could have been worse -- no polonium mentioned this time . 
  it 'd be interesting to see someone do a choropleth world map with shading based on the average number of languages spoken . 
  there was purpose to the post that you wrote here because something that you consider intelligent ( yourself ) accepted writing it as a goal , right ? 
   in terms of productivity , it does seem like a massive loss , but this does n't directly translate to wages and quality of life . 
  well , it 's not as if there 's no quality-of-life gain in having homemakers , but i 'd say that it 's probably a reasonable sell that the value provided by an extra income exceeded that of having a homemaker , since over time , wives have tended to drift away from being housewives . 
  unless there are mis-incentives in the picture somewhere ( * maybe * risk of divorce and being in a bad financial place ) , that seems like a decent argument that people prefer to have the extra income to having mmore domestic work done . 
  also , we did manage to automate a good deal of homemaking work : washing and drying machines , toasters , microwaves , you name it , so households did n't give up as much as would have been the case . 
  i agree that there have been some things that have not been replaced . 
  households ( at least where i live , in the us ) do not eat dishes that require nearly as much preparation or expertise . 
  children grow up with less direct daily with their families than had historically been the case ( and it 's hard to evaluate all the influences of the latter ) . 
  but by-and-large , i do n't get the impression that most husbands are wanting wives to stay home and be homemakers , or wives wanting to homemake . 
   effectively doubling the labour force has put downwards pressure on wages . 
  true , all else held equal . 
  but there have also been overall quality-of-life increases because of what that extra labor produces . 
  if you removed every woman from the workforce , as a society , we would n't have what they produce . 
  do n't get me wrong -- i do think that that there has been a serious lack of examination of where we 've gone as we 've changed society over the last hundred years , and i think that we do n't have some things right . 
  and i recognize that the traditional family structure is one way to go about changing things , and that it 's a proven approach . 
  but i tend to value the idea specialization an awful lot -- it 's given us a lot of the quality-of-life improvements that we 've enjoyed over a much longer period of time . 
   the uk and other european countries have tried subsidising childbirth and it led to increased welfare dependence , poor people having massive families they ca n't afford and more children growing up in poverty which leads to problems such as criminality . 
  there are issues of possible mis-incentives , agreed . 
  but large and poor families are nothing new over the last hundred years ( in fact , i 'd say that over that hundred year span , families have generally become smaller and wealthier ) . 
  and remember that if you do n't provide for a minimum standard of living , you 've other negative effects to account for -- i 'd wager that theft and pickpocketing was worse in pre-welfare london than it is today . 
   the socialist party in the uk brought in hundreds of thousands of third world immigrants and then paid them to outbreed native brits . 
  < shrug  brits are opting out of having kids . 
  it 's not as if subsidies * exclude * them in any way . 
  regardless of whether someone who would have not immigrated to britain lives and dies and has children in the uk or somewhere else in the world , those same britons do n't have a society that is long-term sustainable . 
  supposing not a single person chose to immigrate to britain for the next two centuries . 
  britain would simply dwindle . 
   in the long-run i do n't think any developed country has a workable formula to maintain its working population while treating women as equal citizens , see some of my previous research into the subject . 
  i was posting [ about this earlier ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4e5bh0/the_average_age_for_first_marriage_in_europe_is/d1y9pc8?context=1 ) . 
  paraphrasing : i 'm suspicious that moving to a more-specialized form of child-rearing that involves things like schools taking a greater role , possibly taking infants to term in a synthetic womb , will ultimately be where things wind up . 
   most areas of labor have become specialized , and we 've enjoyed gains in efficiency there . 
  child-bearing and child-rearing largely have not ( other than in the shift to daycares and public schools ) . 
    note that this is not a trivial thing to change . 
  the family structure that we 've built up and the way children are raised is a huge chunk of society , and not something to change and get something working correctly in one go . 
  there have been various people who have tried experimenting with alternatives -- israeli [ * kibbutzim * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kibbutz ) would be one example -- communes , [ some of which performed communal raising of children ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kibbutz#children ) .
