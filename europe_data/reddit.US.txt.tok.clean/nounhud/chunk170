  one fundamental requirement of a customs union -- and the eu 's single market is a superset of a customs union -- is that individual members can not negotiate their own trade agreements . 
  that 's necessary for the customs union to work as a customs union at all . 
  the us [ worked with right-wing italian groups to arrange for stay-behind operatives in the event of soviet invasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_gladio ) . 
  the fact that said right-wing groups also had their own goals and did their own things does not mean that this was a us operation to murder italian citizens . 
  got ta be schroedinger 's britain . 
  same was true of all the europeans who moved over here . 
  i can deal with bickering . 
  warring is more problematic . 
   from a pitch to rescue an imperiled eu-u.s. trade pact , to an impassioned reaffirmation of nato 's common defense doctrine , to a pep talk on how to combat nationalism and xenophobia , u.s. secretary of state john kerry ... that 's damn right . 
  if there is any people who can truly be said to have triumphed over nationalism , it is the great and glorious american people . 
  watch and learn , euros !, 
  that 's probably not true . 
  he wanted `` median '' . 
  yeah , but how often does it have political consequences ?

  i do n't think that the vote did anything to improve respect . 
  point well-taken , though the [ zipper ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49287.htm ) in brussels is more than just a conference room . 
  probably some people would choose to remain . 
  hell , maybe they 'd enough demand for fewer people . 
  i would n't advocate forcing them to move , just not trying to freeze populations in one place . 
  when the mining in [ bodie ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bodie,_california ) ended , almost everyone left . 
  just was n't a reason to stay anymore . 
  you do n't think that people should be willing to move to where economic demand is ? 
  really and honestly , liberal democrats , if you ca n't capitalize on the present circus , you might as well just hang up your hats and go home , because it is n't gon na get better than this .

   man , stiglitz really doesnt like the euro . 
  his writing [ books about how the eurozone sucks and is inherently unequal and needs to adopt more wealth redistribution like the us does ] ( https://www.amazon.com/euro-its-threat-future-europe-ebook/dp/b01c544kuo/ref=asap_bc?ie=utf8 ) has distracted him recently from his previous hobby , writing [ books about how the american economy sucks and is inherently unequal and needs to adopt more wealth redistribution like europe does ] ( https://www.amazon.com/price-inequality-divided-society-endangers/dp/0393345068/ref=asap_bc?ie=utf8 ) . 
  current book 's amazon summary :  the inability of the eurozone to match the recovery in the usa and uk has exposed its governing structures , institutions and policies as dysfunctional and called into question the viability of a common currency shared by such different economies as germany and greece . 
    designed to bring the european union closer together , the euro has actually done the opposite : after nearly a decade without growth , unity has been replaced with dissent and enlargements with prospective exits . 
  joseph stiglitz argues that europe 's stagnation and bleak outlook are a direct result of the fundamental flaws inherent in the euro project - economic integration outpacing political integration with a structure that promotes divergence rather than convergence . 
  money relentlessly leaves the weaker member states and goes to the strong , with debt accumulating in a few ill-favoured countries . 
  the question then is : can the euro be saved ? 
  on the other hand , excerpts from his last book : on economic mobility :  indeed , according to the economic mobility project , `` there is a stronger link between parental education and children 's economic , educational , and socio-emotional outcomes '' in the united states than in any other country investigated , including those of `` old europe '' ( the uk , france , germany , and italy ) , other english speaking countries ( canada and australia ) , and the nordic countries sweden , finland , and denmark , where the results were more expected .73 a variety of other studies have corroborated these findings .74 [ snip ]  incarceration even distorts our unemployment statistics . 
  individuals in prison are disproportionately poorly educated and come from groups that otherwise face high unemployment . 
  it is highly likely that , if they were n't incarcerated , they would join the already swollen ranks of the unemployed . 
  viewed in this light , america 's true unemployment rate would be worse , and it would compare less favorably with that of europe ; if the entire prison population of nearly 2.3 million was counted , the unemployment rate would be well above 9 percent .64 [ snip ]  the u.s. incarceration rate of 730 per 100,000 people ( or almost 1 in 100 adults ) , is the world 's highest and some nine to ten times that of many european countries .61 some u.s. states spend as much on their prisons as they do on their universities .62 [ snip ]  even before the burst in inequality that marked the first decade of this century , the united states already had more inequality and less income mobility than practically every country in europe , as well as australia and canada . 
  [ snip ]  but the average american gets just an average education -- and in mathematics , key to success in many areas of modern life , it 's subpar . 
  this is in contrast to china ( shanghai and hong kong ) , korea , finland , singapore , canada , new zealand , japan , australia , netherlands , and belgium , which perform significantly above average on all tests ( reading and mathematics ) .82 if you want to feel depressed , you can read the one that tells you how much worse the eu is than the us , and if you want to feel smug , read the previous book . 
  my takeaway is that there 's a substantial market of readers in each place who want to buy books telling them that they 're doing everything wrong and the rest of the developed world has it right . 
  substantial chunks of europe have been [ substantially-better-off than much of the world for a long time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_divergence ) . 
  it 's not clear to me that that is n't long-term sustainable . 
  hmm . 
  syria is n't a member of the oecd , and searching for `` oecd literacy '' does n't seem to turn up any statistics for me involving syria . 
  are you thinking of unesco ? 
  that lists [ syria as having an 86.4 % adult literacy rate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_literacy_rate ) . 
  as an aside , i checked the unesco definition . 
  it appears to be self-declared , so i 'm not sure how much of a role [ dunning-kruger effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunning%e2%80%93kruger_effect ) might play . 
  over 50 % seems unreasonably high to me , off-the-cuff , though . 
  maybe 50 % are functionally illiterate in the german language , out of people trying to move to germany ... 
  i would imagine that most people fight for peace , albeit on specific terms . 
  i eemember that someone on here or / r/ukpolitics predicted that one way or another , he 'd unquit within six months . 
  guess they 've got their finger on brit politics pretty well . 
   at the conference , e.u. 
  leaders agreed to give $ 1.5 billion a year in aid through 2020 . 
  overall , western governments offered more than $ 15 billion in aid .

  i think that for the usa , the greatest threat was the confederate states of america . 
  its most-competent military figure was [ robert e. lee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_e._lee ) , and just from his wikipedia display , we 've got ( note that while some of these are in the south , many are not ) : * eight us counties . 
  * a village . 
  * a variety of streets . 
  * two universities . 
  * forty-one schools * an army base * a stained-glass display in the national cathedral * barracks at west point * a steamboat * a warship * a model of tank . 
  * a number of statues and monuments , including one sixty-foot one . 
  * his old home was taken from him , but it was turned into a national monument to him . 
  * a state license plate now , granted , he also served for a long time in the us military and was among the most-successful military leaders , so i suppose that it 's a bit different in that one can sort of `` claim him as one 's own '' . 
  `` benedict arnold '' , hundreds of years later , is still a synonym for being a traitor here ... but there is still a famous monument that omits his name and lauds his accomplishments before going over to the brits , and several other memorials ( though they also omit his name ) . 
  we 've a d-day memorial memorializing stalin . 
  we 've a one-ton bronze statue of baphomet in detroit . 
  i 'll concede that this was originally in front of the oklahoma state legislature and moved after they decided to remove a copy of the ten commandments also there . 
  no hitler statues that i 'm aware of , but i think that that 's more not having built them than trying to tear them down . 
  it looks like during the revolutionary war , there was a lead statue of george iii that was melted down into musket balls , though in all fairness , i suppose that at least part of that was expediency . 
  i 'm not sure that it 's reasonable to say `` you would n't suffer a statue of someone that had caused you harm '' . 
  not specific to natives in the caribbean , but disease killed about 90 % of the native american population . 
  that was the major factor in deaths , and while certainly explorers and conquerors took advantage of the vacuum ... even if they had today 's knowledge of disease , and even had they wanted to save the natives , it 's not clear that they could have done so . 
  i do n't think i 'd agree . 
  i just read through a biography of his , and he was not harsh compared to contemporary people in similar positions . 
  now , granted , that does include ordering executions , extracting tribute , and enslaving people .
