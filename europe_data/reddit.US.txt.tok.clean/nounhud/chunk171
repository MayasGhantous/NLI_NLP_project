    international monetary fund estimates of the size of economies in 2016 puts the uk at # 1,932 bn with france weighing in at $ 2,228 bn , putting the uk ahead so long as a pound buys more than $ 1.153 . 
    at the start of the week , the prime minister , chancellor , foreign secretary and brexit secretary all boasted that britain would get a good deal in eu talks because britain was the fifth-largest economy in the world . 
  at that stage their words could be justified with sterling worth $ 1.16 at the end of last week . 
    the paradox of the tough talk -- with suggestions that britain will leave the single market and clamp down heavily on immigration -- has been to pull the rug from under sterling , leaving it at a post-brexit low of $ 1.14 on wednesday and below the point at which it is the fifth-largest economy . 
    economists do not regard the use of market exchange rates as the best way to measure an economy 's size as conversion rates do not account for the goods and services that can be bought in any country , but britain does even worse on more sophisticated measures . 
    imf figures show that at purchasing-power parity , the uk is only the ninth-largest , behind china , the us , india , japan , germany , russia , brazil and indonesia . 
  on this measure it does sneak ahead of france , which sits in 10th place . 
    britain 's relegation will come as an embarrassment to the prime minister at the conservative party conference because it comes only two days after she said : `` a truly global britain is possible , and it is in sight . 
  and it should be no surprise that it is . 
  because we are the fifth-biggest economy in the world . ''   her words sparked a flurry of copycat statements by ministers who supported both the remain and leave votes in the eu referendum . 
  david davis , brexit secretary , said britain 's position of strength in the world stemmed from being the fifth-largest economy ; philip hammond , chancellor , said that being the fifth-largest allowed britain to negotiate with the likes of france and germany from a position of strength . 
    boris johnson , foreign secretary , said britain was the `` fifth-richest '' economy in the world , but on a comparable measure of gross domestic product per person , the imf ranks britain as only the 27th richest with qatar and luxembourg taking the two top spots . 
    the imf also cut the uk 's 2017 growth forecast to 1.1 per cent , although it remains more optimistic about britain 's prospects next year than most independent forecasters . 
  i mean that a lot of 'em wound up over here rather than dying . 
  well , they do have said governments , but the iraqi one is n't in full control of the country . 
  * the uk has a navy capable of covering the region . 
  this is n't a naval war .

  not an area of expertise , but honestly , i do n't see public support for it in the near future : * inertia . 
  people tend to prefer the status quo . 
  if the brits got over the hump to leave , they 'd have to swing back a fair amount to want to rejoin . 
  people do n't like swallowing their pride , and this would probably appear as such . 
  just as you 've got eu fans here who are outraged because they feel dumped , you 'd have britons who would n't want to be `` crawling back '' . 
  * [ loss aversion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loss_aversion ) . 
  the uk is unlikely , once it has left , to get back its special privileges . 
  that means that rejoining means accepting a loss . 
  my guess is that there 's significant pressure to try to find something better rather than to take something that is known to be worse . 
  without public support , it 'd require the political leadership reversing a popular referendum . 
  honestly , if that happens , i think that the best bet would be canceling the move to brexit before it happens , not trying for a re-join in the near future afterwards . 
  or simply accepting a soft brexit , which probably makes nobody particularly happy , but imho blunts some of the economic harm . 
  like , i 've thought about the possibility of the uk rejoining too , but ... canada has n't wanted to join the us , though it 'd probably mean something of a wealth increase for canadians . 
  switzerland does n't seem gung-ho on joining the eu . 
  those are both smaller countries by large blocs . 
  and the least-enthusiastic about joining the eu seem to be the wealthy countries in europe , and the uk is relatively well-to-do . 
  i think that the eu made the right decision to start with the well-to-do countries , but the flip side is that if any leave , it may be harder to get them back in . 
  and arguments about sovereignty and the like would n't have been addressed . 
  if the eu sees economic convergence and becomes roughly-comparable across-the-board to the uk , that 'd probably address the intra-eu immigration concerns , and that 's really the only thing that seems likely to me to change in favor of a brejoin . 
  at the current rate of convergence , that 's gon na take a while . 
  this seems undiplomatic . 
  i 'll take two . 
  well , i 'm curious . 
  let 's fact-check 'em . 
  [ 2010 : stratfor 's top predictions for the next decade ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/stratfor-predictions-for-the-next-decade-2010-1?op=1/#rope-heightened-native-immigrant-tension-2 ) * china : doomed . 
  seems to be okay thus far . 
  * europe : heightened native-immigrant tension . 
  well , they nailed this one . 
  wrong about the countries where it would be the biggest deal , though : they predicted france , germany , and italy , and yet it 's the uk brexiting . 
  * turkey : rising ehhh ... i dunno . 
  economically it 's continuing to improve . 
  * egypt : rising no , egypt is worse-off due to fallout from the revolution . 
  * india : not a factor yeah , has n't taken off wildly . 
  * iran : pacified well , that one was wrong . 
  * iraq and afghanistan : u.s. out well , isis kinda turned that one on its head . 
  * former soviet states : rising yeah , seems reasonable . 
  * russia : scrambling  `` russia will spend the 2010s seeking to secure itself before the demographic decline really hits . 
  it will do this by trying to move from raw commodity exports to process commodity exports , moving up the value chain to fortify its economy while its demographics still allow it , '' says stratfor 's decade forecast . 
  not that i 'm aware of . 
  probably be a good idea . 
   `` russia will also seek to reintegrate the former soviet republics into some coherent entity in order to delay its demographic problems , expand its market and above all reabsorb some territorial buffers . 
  russia sees itself as under the gun , and therefore is in a hurry . 
  this will cause it to appear more aggressive and dangerous than it is in the long run . 
  however , in the 2010s , russia 's actions will cause substantial anxiety in its neighbors , both in terms of national security and its rapidly shifting economic policies . '', 
  i do n't see `` invading ukraine '' on here . 
  * japan : desperate for labor yeah . 
  * africa : non-factor well , in terms of the refugee crisis , i 'd say that it 's significant in europe . 
  * mexico : rising eh . 
  yes , but nothing dramatically-different .

    `` this does not mean that islamist militancy will be eliminated . 
  attempts at attacks will continue , and some will succeed . '', 
  well , that was pretty epically wrong . 
  * america : dominant in retreat  `` the united states will withdraw for a while from its more aggressive operations in the world , moving to a model of regional balances of power which washington maintains and manipulates when necessary . 
  this will not manifest as introspection , but rather as a rebalancing of u.s. attention and force posture . '', 
  yeah , but honestly , this is in comparison to the bush years . 
  it was pretty unlikely that the us was going to be more-hawkish -- you did n't need stratfor to say that . 
  i have to agree with you . 
  it is very unlikely that mexico will be the next country to exit the eu . 
  i will bet on the uk . 
  that is not the most-impressive blue-screening that i 've ever seen . 
  what i 'm getting at is that i think that very few , and certainly not the typical european , would prefer to starve to death over picking fruit .

  i had a friend who used to watch a lot of anime . 
  in college , he took a japanese language course . 
  the first day , the teachers asked everyone to introduce themselves in japanese so that she could judge pre-existing knowledge . 
  he did so and she cracked up laughing and said `` you speak japanese like a samurai ! '', 
  apparently , he was really into feudal area material , and had said roughly the equivalent of the english `` fair maiden , knowest that my name is sir gawain '' . 
   in campanh\u00e3 , a major station , there were no english translation in any of the signs .

  this made me a bit sad .

  does the eu not mandate multilingual signage , or is that a political hot topic ?

  like , `` th '' as in `` this '' or as in `` thing '' ? 
  presumably they can have a discussion in russian , though ?
