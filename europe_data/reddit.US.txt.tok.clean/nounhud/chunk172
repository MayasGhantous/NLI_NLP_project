  seriously , you guys have damn strong dialects, 
   i can not think of the last time i used cash in europe . 
  how about privacy ? 
  i 'm not sure like the idea of a company knowing everywhere i go and everything i spend . 
   yeah well we had 8 million 1840 , a hundred years later it was 4 million . 
  it 's okay , smaller ireland . 
  their descendants shall live on . 
   in my village in the south of portugal , one of the poorest regions of the eurozone , we have thousands of pakistanis , thais , indians , etc. 
  for doing the farm work . 
  europeans do n't want to do physical labor . 
  they would rather starve to death . 
  i bet that you 're wrong . 
  kill your unemployment benefits , and i bet that you 'll get europeans picking fruit . 
  hmm . 
  see , the problem then becomes that you 're fine with foreigners taking whatever worse option they had that they core to avoid by picking fruit . 
  in fruit picking ? 
  in what way is the work `` underpaid '' ? 
   the eu have a naval force to combat that . 
  the uk does n't ... ireland , i hate to break this to you ... 
  rejecting migrants is n't going to increase fertility rates , though . 
  i mean , i agree that there 's an issue , but it wo n't be solved via not letting people in , either . 
  in some way , society needs to be adjusted to have sustainable fertility rates . 
   if we had joined the euro in 2002 then 2008 would have led to either war or the collapse of the eu . 
  why is that ? 
  well , arguing over definitions is n't that interesting , but if one uses [ wikipedia 's classification of die linke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_left_%28germany%29 ) :  political position : left-wing to far left [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ], 
  [ oh , come on ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2014/10/screen-shot-2014-10-31-at-06.18.49.png ) . 
  no numbers on the legend ? 
  i 'll spoil the surprise : yes , it 's stiglitz arguing that it is doomed . 
  if i were in your shoes , i would rent . 
  you could spend a long time regretting this , and it only buys you a short period of time in the house . 
  you are making a large investment that could be costly . 
  plus , there may well be economic disruption . 
  unless you are very confident in your job not being affected , i 'd want to be cautious . 
  you can save that money that you would use as a down payment and let it work for you and move on even better terms . 
  there 's freedom to living beneath your means . 
  if you 're hell-bent on living in a fancier house , you could rent that . 
  if you rent something similar to what you want to buy , then you have a way to try it out , see what you like and do n't like . 
  a lot of things might have been sufficient to have caused a 2 % swing . 
  you 're talking to a lithuanian . 
  the ussr annexed lithuania in mid-1940 , pre-cold war . 
   also on monday , president putin submitted a bill ( in russian ) to parliament setting a series of pre-conditions for the us for the agreement to be resumed , including :   * reduction of us military infrastructure and troops in countries that joined nato after 1 september 2000 nope . 
  you do n't get to threaten nato members in eastern europe . 
   * lifting of all us sanctions against russia and compensation for the damage they have caused nope . 
  you do n't get to annex bits of ukraine either . 
  definitely an improvement . 
  i remember complaints about the fence , but i think that the goal was to get hungary to register people , not pass them through . 
  i like the art style . 
  the movie one was pretty good , even if the mechanism was underambitious . 
  hey . 
  i was about to say `` that looks like a weak correlation to me '' , but then the article author said :  the coefficient is -0.894 -- that means there is a very strong negative correlation between distance and trade . 
  no , the slope is -0.894 . 
  the correlation coefficient measures how strong the connection is between the line and the data . 
  i think that this is what the 0.2 in the article is -- not a strong correlation . 
   it believes that the eu should push for free trade in goods with the uk , as britain is a big importer of goods , but should restrict trade with britain 's stronger services sector . 
  was that * actually * austria 's rationale ? 
  trying to maintain a trade imbalance ? 
  or is that just the telegraph 's interpretation ? 
  that degree of coverage should be provided for education in germany , or for countries outside ? 
  and misleading . 
   i 'm only 45 kilometers from the american border , and i do n't particularly like my neighbours to the south . 
  i see . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cognitive_biases#frequency_illusion  the illusion in which a word , a name , or other thing that has recently come to one 's attention suddenly seems to appear with improbable frequency shortly afterwards ( not to be confused with the recency illusion or selection bias ) . 
  [ 42 ] colloquially , this illusion is known as the baader-meinhof phenomenon . 
  that helps , but if you have enough people moving , you get [ ethnic enclaves ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_enclave ) that provide services in the native language and goods from home and all that . 
  i mean , the restaurant at the end of my block has people who can manage enough english to take an order , but most of the menu is just spanish , the workers primarily speak spanish , the patrons know maybe a very small amount of english . 
  most customer-service positions in the area tend to have people who can do spanish . 
  and before people came in from mexico and central america , you had ethnic enclaves anywhere there was sufficient population : german , polish , italian , russian , korean , japanese , chinese ( chinatowns in particular are a feature of large us cities ) . 
  spreads out over time as people 's kids move over to english . 
  [ new york probably is the king of these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_york_city_ethnic_enclaves ) . 
  a suck skim seems to show that [ berlin , at least , has substantial spanish-speaking areas ] ( http://m.dw.com/en/out-and-about-in-spanish-speaking-berlin/a-16351421#fromdesktop ) . 
  hmm . 
  if you 're proposing [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p-jrjcrkhi ) for putin , you can see why he might be extremely unwilling to step down . 
  unless you plan to overcome someone via force , you want them to want to go in the direction that you want them to go . 
  also , in romania ... there had n't been a period from out from under the ussr 's thumb . 
  in russia , i 'd imagine that overthrowing the government would be compared to the period after the soviet government was overthrown : not a good time for russians . 
  yeah , i get the direct translation , but ... let me put it this way . 
  in the us , you can distinguish between paleoconservativism and neoconservativism . 
  the former was isolationist , with more of a hard line on social policy , and the latter interventionist . 
  but as far as i can tell , `` neoliberalism '' is used by people on the center-left on this sub as a drop-in replacement for `` liberalism '' , but to attach a negative connotation . 
  to be fair , someone here said that / r/canada is not representative of canadians last time , that it skewed alt-right . 
  i 'm not very familiar with it . 
  if it meant canada establishing trade barriers with the us , though , i think i 'd have the same reservations i do about there being barriers between the uk and the eu -- they 're next door and do a lot of business with each other . 
  does `` neo - '' mean anything beyond `` i do n't like it '' in this context ? 
  i mean , i 'd just say `` liberal '' . 
  i can buy the other items , but it looks like prices in spain [ peaked just about the same time as the us . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_property_bubble ) . 
  maybe 2008 . 
  the [ us was about 2007 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_united_states_housing_bubble ) . 
  that 's a difference , but it 's not enough to make up for the kind of difference in unemployment today . 
  i 'd just have expected people to move to where work is , even if no new businesses showed up . 
  for comparison , [ unemployment rates among us states ] ( http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm ) ranged from 2.9 % to 6.8 % this year , a 3.9 % difference . 
  the eu-28 difference is malta at 3.9 % to greece at 23.5 % , a 19.6 % difference . 
  greece is obviously dealing with unusual problems at the moment , so it seems reasonable to exclude it , but spain is still at 19.6 % , a 15.7 % difference . 
  that seems like a heck of a lot if someone can freely move to another eu member and work there . 
  i mean , i can understand a language barrier , but i 'd rather try and put up with that than spend a decade out of work . 
  as you say , for me the big drawback seems to be that economic ties with the countries in europe are just likely to be more important . 
  yes , the world is smaller today , but not that much smaller . 
  on the other hand , the brits were really upset about the large population movements into the uk -- they did see more than any other member of the eu did . 
  the wealth levels are closer in canada , the uk , new zealand , and australia . 
  one issue i 'd have is that this is presented as comparable to the eu and us . 
  i 'm not sure whether customs unions make sense when trading partners are so different .
