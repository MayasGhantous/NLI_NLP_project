  also , how the hell is spain 's unemployment still so high a decade after the crisis ? 
  people must be working in the black economy or something . 
  it does n't take ten years to start a new business . 
  based on gambling laws , it would have blackjack , but might not have hookers : prostitution is illegal in canada , though legal in the other members . 
  the uk actually had a very good unemployment rate in the eu-28 , but germany was lower : https://www.statista.com/statistics/268830/unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/, 
  i think that the thread becomes too thin to realistically predict what happens at that level of detail . 
  the political currents in so many countries would have been changed radically . 
  world war ii gets the coverage it does because of how much it did to shape the world outside of germany today . 
  it resulted in the partition of europe in the cold war . 
  it changed the us 's role in the world from being very introverted to very extroverted . 
  it affected the lives and fortunes of many people in europe directly . 
  i do n't know much about the thuringii -- just as a vague member in the handful of germanic tribes -- but covering their history , while interesting , would probably not do as much to explain the shape of the world today . 
  worse than vw in the eu or worse than vw in the us ? 
  thr eu will not expect the us not to have a relationship with the uk going forward . 
  ... wait , when did trump advocate for tearing the eu apart ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hear,_hear it 's `` hear '' , not `` here '' . 
  such is the price of non-phonetic spellings . 
  i 'm not sure what the process is . 
  they may be done quietly , by bureaucrats , without a lot of political involvement . 
  it would certainly help the process , which already will have a short time , move more quickly . 
  if so , there may not be much high-profile stuff going on until the end when the results are announced . 
   and once the country starts competing on welfare policies the likelihood of young open minded people leaving for a better life will get a lot higher . 
  our welfare users have n't left * en masse * for the eu , and we 're not known for extensive welfare policies . 
   in general , how do you feel about the subreddit ? 
  it 's pretty good . 
   do you believe it is better or worse than a year ago ? 
  better , mostly . 
  that may have more to do with what 's in the news . 
   how do you feel about the moderation of the subreddit ? 
  i say it 's decent . 
  i 'm one of the `` lean toward a lighter hand on moderation '' crowd . 
  i 've occasionally been annoyed when i post a comment that i 'd call clearly not objectionable in a thread containing two people flaming each other , and the whole thread gets nuked because of the flamewar . 
  mods are good at explaining why a comment was removed , and making it visible to others . 
   do you think our rules are on the spot , overbearing or underwhelming ? 
  i 'm not sure that i like the `` local news '' rule . 
  it 's a clearer now , but i enjoy things like scenery from romania or posting architecture , and this would seem to violate the local news bit . 
  the blogspam rule :  blogspam ( if stolen content/direct copy ) : original news content on blogs is fine , but the largely copy-pasted stuff from earlier articles with a short line or paragraph of commentary is not . 
  ... is maybe sensible , but i do think that it 's a bit odd to complain about copyright infringement when the subreddit bot specifically tells people to copy-paste the bodies of paywalled sites . 
  the violence and criminal activity endorsement rule :  ... endorsement of violence or other criminal activity . 
  that may be * applied * well , but the text is very broad . 
  arguably the subreddit bot that encourages article copy-pasting violates it . 
  i dislike the askhistorians model . 
  they go so far as to prohibit text from wikipedia , which i think is very useful . 
  do you have notes on why they were removed ? 
  typepad , for example , is particularly annoying for comment links . 
  if it were for posts , i would n't mind -- okay , fine , lots of low-quality personal sites -- but it 's kind of annoying that i ca n't reference it in comments , where i 'd think that it would n't be problematic . 
  does the bot track removal statistics and removed comments ? 
  it seems like taking a glance at the comments that were removed for the most-frequently-removed sites occasionally might be a way to sanity-check it . 
  interesting to note that that front page is also sporting [ an op-ed calling for a soft brexit ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/01/this-is-the-only-way-brexit-wont-plunge-us-over-the-cliff/ ) . 
  huh , i was going to suggest amazon.ie , but apparently that redirects to amazon uk . 
  if this is a hard brexit ( the next question , and one that i doubt will be answered soon ) i guess that will have to change too . 
  [ * the telegraph * 's front page is dominated by this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/ ) . 
  i think that two-and-a-half years is probably already pretty short for the kind of legal , diplomatic , and economic changes that the uk is going to be looking at . 
  another [ gentlemanly german world war i ship , the * emden * ] ( http://militaryhistorynow.com/2013/05/08/the-kaisers-pirate-ship-the-unbelievable-voyage-of-the-sms-emden/ ) . 
  interesting club : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_leaning_towers, 
  over crimea ? 
  russia 's being sanctioned . 
  over not paying compensation to the mh17 victims ? 
  any attempt to physically force payment would probably cost more than you 'd get back . 
  my guess is that the long term political costs of not paying will outweigh any short term gains . 
  maybe there will be some sort of legal action now that the final report is out . 
  there * have * been some [ inventive ways to enforce court rulings against sovereign powers overseas ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-fund-elliott-capital-management-seizes-ara-libertad-ship-owned-by-argentina-2012-10 ) if you 've got enough clout . 
  over lying about it ? 
  there are no laws against lying . 
  might be kinda scary if there were , depending upon how a lie is evaluated . 
  it 's been publicly debunked by the dutch , though . 
  the problem with lying is that you ca n't build reputation . 
  one day , maybe . 
  iran 's involved in yemen . 
  i do n't see iran on the list -- just the countries backing the sunnis . 
   countries in the corruption index are ranked according survey responses to the following three questions :   1 . 
  in your country , how common is illegal diversion of public funds to companies , individuals , or groups ? 
  in your country , how do you rate the ethical standards of politicians ? 
  in your country , how common is it for firms to make undocumented extra payments or bribes ? 
  yeah ... it seems unlikely that most of this is first-hand knowledge . 
  it 's better than nothing , but it 's not on par with `` have you personally had to pay a bribe in the last year '' or similar . 
  i wish that someone would develop better ways of measuring corruption . 
  i remember a while back , when someone figured out that they could measure drug use -- also hard to gather data on -- by sampling sewage . 
  corruption needs some sort of similar clever breakthrough . 
   apple is n't pushing manufacturers to stay clear of competition to their services . 
  they themselves are the manufacturer . 
  https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-blocks-competitive-products-from-iphone-app-store-surprised/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ios_app_approvals  applicants have been denied apps for fundamentally duplicating apple apps , for example by providing an email interface with no added functionality or use , [ 8 ] or having the same elements as the built in sms app . 
  [ 9 ] applications have also been rejected for duplicating the functionality of itunes . 
  i think that that 's ahistorical . 
  italy might have hoped for the us to potentially not declare war until japan ended the question with pearl harbor , but there was no way that it was joining the axis . 
  the [ tripartite pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tripartite_pact ) was signed sept 27 1940 :  the tripartite pact was directed primarily at the united states . 
  its practical effects were limited , since the italo-german and japanese operational theatres were on opposite sides of the world and the high contracting powers had disparate strategic interests . 
  some technical cooperation was carried out , and the japanese declaration of war on the united states propelled , although it did not require , a similar declaration of war from all the other signatories of the tripartite pact . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_the_united_states_during_world_war_ii  american public opinion was hostile to hitler 's germany , but how much aid to give the allies was controversial . 
  public opinion was even more hostile to japan , and there was little opposition to increased support for china . 
  by 1940 the u.s. , while still neutral , was becoming the `` arsenal of democracy '' for the allies , supplying money and war materials . 
  the sudden defeat of france in spring 1940 caused the nation to begin to greatly grow its armed forces , including the first peacetime draft . 
  after the german invasion of the soviet union in june 1941 , america began sending lend lease aid to the soviet union as well as britain and china . 
  seems like this award represents a stand against sexual assault , which is presumably what matters . 
  yeah , i 'm not saying that the submitters are editorializing , but rather that the original articles are heavily-loaded with clickbait titles . 
  if the us wanted snowden dead and was willing to ignore borders , he 'd be dead , regardless of where he is . 
  he 's alive because the us is n't willing to ignore borders or kill him . 
  politicians , regardless of party , are going to make use of the bureaucracy . 
  that 's pretty much the only sane option , unless you want to try booting out and rehiring a bureaucracy every few years . 
  http://www.eurasiareview.com/30092016-pictures-left-incomplete-mh17-and-the-joint-investigation-team-oped/ eurasia review just put out an op-ed about how the dutch mh17 investigation was rigged from the beginning and ca n't be trusted , to provide a bit of perspective on the publication 's viewpoint .
