  i 'm curious whether the self-driving car increases the popularity of suburbs ( cheap , driverless taxis ) or increases the popularity of cities ( no need for parking or stressful driving ) . 
  i suspect that either way will change hsousing values quote a bit , though . 
  well , make a serious prediction for how clothing will change in the next century . 
  / r/retrofuturism lists a lot of predictions , and i 'm struck by how off the fashion ones were . 
  sometimes , you see clothes nit changing at all . 
  other times , there 's an over-extrapolation . 
  we did n't all wind up wearing jumpsuits , even though clothes did wind up becoming simpler . 
  i 'm no fashion expert , but a few thoughts on long-term fashion trends : * the slow shift of women 's clothing towards men 's has not stopped . 
  * men 's clothing tends to draw from military styles . 
  think of aviator sunglasses or bomber jackets . 
  * since the victorian era , clothing has generally become simpler and quicker to get on . 
  surstr\u00f6mming ? 
  well , it 's not phonetic , but a big chunk of that was because [ you conquered and ruled england for a long time ] ( http://geoffboxell.tripod.com/words.htm ) . 
  trucidator , trolling is not really cricket , yes ? 
  sure . 
  you might want to reload , since i went back and filled it out a bit more , like with current language ability in the eu . 
  there are also a few more out-there options . 
  * latin . 
  served this role in europe for some time ( for the educated , not the masses ) , but i do n't think that the arguments for letting it die before have changed . 
  it just does n't seem to have any real benefits versus a living language . 
  * esperanto or a similar synthetic language . 
  i like the idea of synthetic languages , but uptake has been abysmal . 
  i think that perhaps we underestimate how solid of a job natural language does at meeting the needs of its speakers . 
  my guess is that a synthetic language in large-scale , real-world use would slowly morph into a natural language via slang , idioms , and so forth . 
  there is no comparable existing corpus of content . 
  there are few speakers . 
  first , i 'm not the person who you were originally talking to -- he was trolling to get a rise out of you . 
  i was riffing on the us-british english difference . 
  i am sensitive to the political costs of adoption . 
  i 've spoken to some people in the us that dislike use of metric , and as far as i can tell , it comes mostly down to a not-invented-here attitude ... and there is far less culture and social importance attached to metric than to language . 
  i agree that it does create an advantage to use one 's native language . 
  i first remember running into this in leo frankowski 's * the cross-time engineer * , where he pointed out that polish engineering students need to learn polish , then need to learn english , then do the engineering work . 
  however ... my ancestors did n't speak english . 
  they came to the us , and now i do n't speak their language ... but i do n't give that a thought on a daily basis . 
  they would have been at a disadvantage for a generation , but it does n't impact me , and now i enjoy some substantial benefits from them having paid that price once . 
  i believe that a significant advantage that the us enjoys is having a single language . 
  it permits for labor mobility : anyone , not just a well-educated elite , can travel throughout the country and work and interact without effort . 
  it makes it easier to sell products and offer services across markets and expand businesses quickly throughout the us . 
  it facilitates creation of a single identity , since there are n't linguistic barriers to spread of cultural ideas . 
  the eu , on the other hand , is currently fairly-fragmented . 
  there are three ways to deal with that that i can see . 
  * accept it , and bear it as an ongoing cost . 
  there have been past empires that never had a single language that could be used across them . 
  it is not something that i think is fatal , though i think that it is a very significant cost . 
  the peoples in the eu will bear the disadvantages that you mention going forward when dealing with things throughout the eu . 
  some people would like this . 
  * develop automated translation such that the barriers to language are very low . 
  google translate is much cruder than what i 'm talking about , even though it helps . 
  my view -- and it is a widely-held view -- is that human-level translation is almost certainly an [ ai-hard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ai-complete ) problem . 
  basically , we probably ca n't do this without developing human-level ai . 
  if we can achieve human-level ai , society will change so dramatically * anyway * that language barriers will probably be relatively-low on the list of our concerns . 
  * unify . 
  this does n't mean forcing it through , but realistically , * de-facto * standards emerge . 
  doing so will probably advantage someone . 
  [ ranked by number of speakers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers ) , the contenders : * chinese . 
  largest number of speakers , but [ the spoken language is fragmented ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_varieties_of_chinese ) , with substantial groups of these speakers not mutually-intelligible to each other , though china is working towards steadily unifying it . 
  the written language and the spoken language are essentially disconnected , which means that one must effectively be bilingual to be literate , which is an ongoing cost to pay ... what one wants to avoid in the first place . 
  little current uptake in the eu . 
  * english . 
  the * de-facto * international language in many areas today . 
  common in the wealthy world ( and thus important in the world 's economy ) , common in the better-off portions of india , used in the anglosphere . 
  suffers from inconsistent spelling , true , but that 's reformable ( something which i personally would rather like to see happen ) . 
  of the european colonizers , the english had the most success in spreading their language around . 
  of the available options , i 'd call it probably the best overall . 
  [ within the eu , 51 % of the population can speak english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_european_union ) , which is well in the lead ( though the uk leaving would certainly impact this ) . 
  * spanish . 
  60 % of the global number of speakers of english . 
  [ on the order of 90 % of these are in the americas ] ( http://www.spanishseo.org/img/2008/09/worldwide-spanish-speaking-population.png ) , meaning that adoption in the eu means a lot of people picking up a new language . 
  while the hispanic countries in the americas are better-off than africa , they still do represent a comparatively-small chunk of the world 's economy . 
  like english , does n't suffer from the written/spoken split in chinese . 
  like english , does n't suffer from fragmentation , and has speakers that are mutually-intelligible . 
  spoken by 15 % of the eu 's population . 
  * arabic . 
  [ fragmented ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/06/arabic ) , and probably considered one language more for political reasons than linguistic . 
  * is * widely-used near europe and if the eu winds up taking in many more arabic-speakers in the future , this might have some significant benefit . 
  * hindi . 
  i used to be more-bullish on this than i once was . 
  after talking to some people more-familiar with the language situation in india , my understanding is that hindi is really used as the common language in the less-developed northern areas of india , and that english has had rather-more-success in the developed portions of india . 
  * russian . 
  this is probably one of the better options as well . 
  it 's phonetic . 
  the ussr helped spread it in europe . 
  unfortunately , it also has political baggage attached to that , and a lot of folks here consider its star to be falling , not rising -- that it 's a language more-heavily used by older people in eastern europe . 
  were there the political will to do so in the eu , i suppose that the eu could adopt russian . 
  spoken by 6 % of the eu 's population . 
  * bengali . 
  i have n't poked into it . 
  i suspect that the arguments for using it probably look like those for hindi , but less compelling . 
  * portuguese . 
  [ the arguments for this look similar to those for spanish ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/falantes_no_mundo.jpg ) , but with less-than-half the global speakers . 
  * malay . 
  i have n't poked into it , do n't know degree of fragmentation . 
  most of the population that speaks it is just working its way out of the undeveloped world . 
  * french . 
  there was a point in time when this was the international language in some areas , before the world got a lot smaller . 
  decent uptake in europe , though most use outside is in africa , in some of the worst-off places in the world . 
  i know that france would like this to take over , but i have a hard time seeing it having the opportunity today : i do n't see a second era of colonization happening , and i do n't think that france is going to pull a stalin and try to forcibly sell french on other countries . 
  26 % of the eu 's population can speak french . 
  * german . 
  not widely-used outside of the eu , but the most-common first language within the eu , more-common than french .
