  well , it 's not as if the question of federalism is the only question for the eu .

   at the same time , mr. trump 's team and the candidate himself suggested in media interviews that he was `` softening '' his immigration stance , particularly on deporting illegal immigrants already in the u.s. [ he 's working on it .

  well , * this * is gon na put a hole in our glorious isolation . 
  canadians are distantly-related to the dutch . 
  `` side '' of what ? 
  one point of my own -- the paper again mentioned [ dugin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandr_dugin ) 's ideas . 
  these have come up on here before , iirc from estonians talking about them . 
  from my skim last time of what he had advocated before , a goal was to isolate the eastern parts of europe from germany by offering germany favorable arrangements , which would permit russia a free hand in eastern countries . 
  i 'm assuming that this is what the berlin-moscow-paris axis in the article refers to . 
  from the wikipedia article on his * foundations of geopolitics * : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics  * germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most protestant and catholic states located within central and eastern europe . 
  kaliningrad oblast could be given back to germany . 
  the book uses the term a `` moscow-berlin axis '' . 
  [ 1 ]   * france should be encouraged to form a `` franco-german bloc '' with germany . 
  both countries have a `` firm anti-atlanticist tradition '' . 
  [ 1 ] ] a lot of the concepts there seem to my layman 's eyes to be unrealistically ambitious . 
   * united kingdom should be cut off from europe . 
  [ 1 ]   * finland should be absorbed into russia . 
  southern finland will be combined with the republic of karelia and northern finland will be `` donated to murmansk oblast '' . 
  [ 1 ]   * estonia should be given to germany 's sphere of influence . 
  [ 1 ]   * latvia and lithuania should be given a `` special status '' in the eurasian-russian sphere . 
  [ 1 ]   * poland should be granted a `` special status '' in the eurasian sphere . 
  [ 1 ]   * romania , macedonia , `` serbian bosnia '' and greece -- `` orthodox collectivist east '' -- will unite with the `` moscow the third rome '' and reject the `` rational-individualistic west '' . 
  [ 1 ]   * ukraine should be annexed by russia because '' `` ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning , no particular cultural import or universal significance , no geographic uniqueness , no ethnic exclusiveness , its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of eurasia and , without resolving the ukrainian problem , it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics '' . 
  ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent , unless it is cordon sanitaire , which would be inadmissible . 
  [ 1 ]   in the middle east and central asia :   the book stresses the `` continental russian-islamic alliance '' which lies `` at the foundation of anti-atlanticist strategy '' . 
  the alliance is based on the `` traditional character of russian and islamic civilization '' . 
    * iran is a key ally . 
  the book uses the term `` moscow-tehran axis '' . 
  [ 1 ]   * armenia has a special role and will serve as a `` strategic base '' and it is necessary to create `` the [ subsidiary ] axis moscow-erevan-teheran '' . 
  armenians `` are an aryan people ... [ like ] the iranians and the kurds '' . 
  [ 1 ]   * azerbaijan could be `` split up '' or given to iran . 
  [ 1 ]   * georgia should be dismembered . 
  abkhazia and `` united ossetia '' ( which includes georgia 's south ossetia ) will be incorporated into russia . 
  georgia 's independent policies are unacceptable . 
  [ 1 ]   * russia needs to create `` geopolitical shocks '' within turkey . 
  these can be achieved by employing kurds , armenians and other minorities . 
  [ 1 ]   * the book regards the caucasus as a russian territory , including `` the eastern and northern shores of the caspian ( the territories of kazakhstan and turkmenistan ) '' and central asia ( mentioning kazakhstan , uzbekistan , kirghistan and tajikistan ) . 
  [ 1 ]   in asia :   * china , which represents a danger to russia , `` must , to the maximum degree possible , be dismantled '' . 
  dugin suggests that russia start by taking tibet-xinjiang-mongolia-manchuria as a security belt . 
  [ 2 ] russia should offer china help `` in a southern direction -- indochina ( except vietnam ) , the philippines , indonesia , australia '' as geopolitical compensatation . 
  [ 1 ]   * russia should manipulate japanese politics by offering the kuril islands to japan and provoking anti-americanism . 
  [ 1 ]   * mongolia should be absorbed into eurasia-russia . 
  [ 1 ]   the book emphasizes that russia must spread anti-americanism everywhere : `` the main ` scapegoat ' will be precisely the u.s. ''   in the united states :   * russia should use its special forces within the borders of the united states to fuel instability and separatism . 
  for instance , provoke `` afro-american racists '' . 
  russia should `` introduce geopolitical disorder into internal american activity , encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic , social and racial conflicts , actively supporting all dissident movements -- extremist , racist , and sectarian groups , thus destabilizing internal political processes in the u.s. 
  it would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in american politics . 
  '' [ 1 ]   the eurasian project could be expanded to south and central america . 
  [ 1 ] basically , this seems to me to be awfully-casual about neutralizing or breaking up much larger and more-powerful political units . 
  why would france or germany accept some sort of short-term deal that would end the european project ? 
  i do n't think that germany is likely to give up on the eu for an offer of kaliningrad . 
  sure , the us has some friction on race , but you are n't going to paralyze the us on foreign affairs no matter how many blm protests you fund . 
  `` dismantling '' china ? 
  russia was on much worse terms with china when china was far weaker and russia far stronger , and china sailed on past that . 
  and as for disinformation and breaking up nato and encouraging race tensions in the us ... the soviet union was not idle during the cold war . 
  if it did n't accomplish dugin 's goals then via those mechanisms , why would it be more successful now ? 
  this seems like just repeating the same thing again in the hopes that this time it works . 
  i just do n't see them as realistic threats . 
  i may have shortened that too much -- the paper said alienate them from the societies in which they live , not alienate them from russia , if it was confusing . 
  summary from my read-through : * more and more often , governments are funding ngos ( non-governmental organizations ) in other countries to influence opinion there . 
  * in the eu , governments have the power to obtain information about funding of ngos . 
  * russia currently is viewed largely-negatively in the world and would like to change this . 
  * russia is quite restrictive on us and european ngos in russia , moreso than europe and the us are on russia-backed ngos , disallowing 80 % of ngo formation requests . 
  * russia relies on coercion in soft power rather than selling an attractive image . 
  * snowden 's spying revelations and the iraq war weakened the us image . 
  * austerity harmed the eu image in some eu members . 
  * russia saw a values vacuum and moved to fill it . 
  * a model involving democracy and a lenient set of social rules are portrayed as being in opposition to eurasianism . 
  instead , shared heritage and conservative social values are focused on . 
  the us is portrayed as an enemy . 
  in europe , the right and center-right is targeted on conservative values , and the left and center-left on the cruelty of austerity . 
  * in europe , russia has aimed to support organizations opposed to nato . 
  * russia aims to encourage alienation of russian-speakers living abroad . 
  * the overall policy goal is to produce a paris-moscow-berlin axis . 
  * the primary lever in western europe is business ties with russia . 
  * in orthodox countries , orthodox ties are used . 
  * in slavic countries , slavic ties are emphasized . 
  * in the baltics , efforts are made to use the russophones . 
  * in neutral countries , neutrality is leveraged . 
  * most spending goes to the balkans and ex-soviet states , particularly the baltics . 
  * funds are mostly transferred through a chain of intermediaries to make them hard to trace . 
  * not all recipients know that the funds they get are from moscow . 
  * russia has sent money to discourage shale gas exploitation in europe , as this would render russia dependent upon europe . 
  * efforts are tied to the dominant party in russia as well as to the state . 
  * russia is unhappy about both nato and eu expansion . 
  there is a list of identified russia-backed ngos at this point . 
  * the baltics have taken more restrictive actions on these ngos than has the rest of europe . 
  * suggested european responses include including russian minorities in society to block alienation and a mandatory lobbying register and providing more information to the european public on these organizations . 
  increasing police and intelligence agency focus on russia-backed ngos is another option .
