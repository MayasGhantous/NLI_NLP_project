  * investigation of politicians who abruptly adopt a pro-russia position is encouraged , as it may be due to funds from russia . 
  * rfe/rl and belsat tv ( apparently a polish-run broadcaster in belarus ) already spreads information about known russia-funded efforts . 
  * european spending on ngos is larger but unlike russia has not attempted to alienate minority groups in russia . 
  * the paper 's authors encourage permitting russia-backed ngos to operate , but with public awareness of who funds them . 
  recommendations for eu : * market eu positively to counter negative messages propagated by russia . 
  * minorities targeted by russia should not be permitted to feel excluded . 
  * the public in the eu should be better informed on russia 's disinformation activities . 
  * mandatory information disclosure from ngos on funding should be increased . 
  * the eu should increase russian-language output aimed at both russia and russophones in the eu . 
  * politician voting records should be analyzed to search for potential influence . 
  * further funding into investigation of russian-backed ngos is recommended .

  if both the eu and the uk wanted , i expect that they could establish at least a transitional trade arrangement in two years . 
   the phrase `` cultural suicide by demographic transformation '' is an outright statement of white supremacy . 
  well , `` cultural suicide '' seems unnecessarily emotive . 
  but in the sense that people do not simply drop culture when immigrating , that sufficiently-large-scale immigration does change culture and that most people have some cap on the amount of change that they 're willing to see , i do n't think that this is an uncommon opinion , though that cap may vary . 
  and that 's a phenomenon that 's much more far-stretching than over peoples divided by skin color or even country -- people in the us south resented [ carperbaggers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carpetbagger ) from the north .

  it 's actually not country a 's responsibility to stop people from leaving to country b -- that 's country b 's job . 
  it normally would n't matter that much , but because everyone is hoping to exploit asylum claim loopholes that mean that one does n't have to hear an asylum claim unless actually in the country , stopping people before they touch your soil to bock the asylum claim becomes a big deal . 
  some thoughts : * if a weak social safety net tends to produce more income mobility , it should be possible to look for correlation with existing countries . 
  * i have never been very enthusiastic about large-scale government education subsidies . 
  education generally has a positive return on investment : that is , people already capture a benefit of having more education , and subsidies to people with higher education is a regressive policy . 
  you 'd have to argue that there are large positive externalities that are n't currently captured . 
  while i think that education is important , i think that the biggest issue is less subsidy and more : * reducing the cost of education . 
  the most-common job in the us is `` teacher '' , and that 's not even counting higher education . 
  that means that any improvements to the efficiency of the thing yield major benefits . 
  i am enthusiastic about things like [ moocs ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/massive_open_online_course ) , for example . 
  * reducing the dropout rate of education . 
  if someone wants to learn to do something , but the education system can not get him from where he currently is to doing that , the education system is flawed . 
  * improving advice as to what fields to enter and the relative tradeoffs . 
  yeah , it 's hard , but do you expect a thirteen-year-old to make better predictions than the government ? 
  people start choosing what to learn about as a kid , and i know that i would have been in a poor position to predict future demand as a kid . 
  hell , i do n't think that i even saw pay information for different jobs until near the end of secondary school . 
  what are the chances of success in pro sports , say ? 
  * improving adult education/retraining . 
  it will not be as valuable to teach an adult something as it is a child , since it 's possible to get more years of future use of that skillset from the child , but without dong so , it is very painful to see demand reduced in an industry . 
  retraining is not , i think , something that society yet has solved well . 
  four hundred years ago , it did n't matter as much -- most people were small-scale farmers and there were rarely massive upheavals in industry , where entire skillsets would become obsolete quickly . 
    they choose to turn off all radar signals     the reykjav\u00edk air traffic control center contacted the icelandic pilots to report two unidentified aircraft   one of those statements has to be false . 
  why ? 
  planes without transponders , unless they 're particularly stealthy , will show up on active radars , but without identification . 
  yeah , maybe they achieved ftl flight first , but we 're gon na be the first to use it to get to the moon , just you wait !, 
  we have an fta with canada . 
  neither one of us has exploded . 
  summary : the authors want more state subsidies for education to provide a more-skilled workforce . 
  they want a weaker social safety net to encourage doing something with those skills .

  eh , [ human interest stories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_interest_story ) work well . 
  the legal basis could equally involve a mandate to , say , produce constitutional change in germany , force all members to withdraw from the refugee convention in its current form , or similar . 
  it need not mean adopting the most-permissive approach . 
  do n't get me wrong -- i 'm all for the idea of european members working together on the migrant issue , since without that , it 'll be difficult to accomplish anything . 
  people feel very strongly about rapid immigration that they can not limit . 
  it caused massive political revolts in the us around the 1870s before we had immigration control , including lynchings . 
  you will quite possibly lose your second-largest member because of disagreements over immigration . 
  hungary [ potentially has taken the first step towards leaving too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_migrant_quota_referendum,_2016 ) . 
  there have been major shifts in power towards hard-right politicians in the eu . 
  these are serious concerns for the eu . 
  i think that it would be very unwise to underestimate the political costs of requiring immigration . 
  the question becomes what is more important -- addressing the union 's stability or improving the condition of the migrants in question ? 
  a few points : * the vote was on redistribution of 120,000 , yes ? 
  i think that everyone recognizes that this is not a number intended to fully address the problem , but rather one intended to create a precedent . 
  let us suppose that , for example , eu members signed a treaty that no more than n people per capita would be redistributed per year . 
  that seems likely to make this more-appealing and less of a blank check . 
  * i think that there have been very valid points raised about the viability of keeping people in eastern europe . 
  that might permit germany to shed welfare requirements for some of them , but if it winds up with a lot of people simply illegally in germany , it does n't seem like it 's improved matters . 
  * i think that you would probably agree that economic factors are a significant factor in why people are showing up in the eu . 
  redistribution might address the short-term concern , but it does not address the longer-term question of incentives . 
  * all or almost all of the people in question do not meet the `` first safe country '' criteria of the refugee convention for their illegal entry to either greece or italy . 
  to require that member countries not treat the people in question as having illegally entered the eu represents a legalization of their status . 
  we do n't normally , and i would n't particularly like it . 
  we * have * accepted some degree of identity requirements on aircraft , where it used to just be throwing down money and getting onboard . 
  realistically , trains are n't all that different . 
  but ... i also would n't accept requiring 24 hour notice to cross a state border . 
  besides , if you do that and supply reliable identity information in that period , you 've already given up your privacy anyway . 
  ( okay , via passenger rail would be mostly-irrelevant in the us , where few people use passenger rail , but in europe it 's obviously a bigger deal ) . 
  limiting cross-border transit that much would be hugely-damaging . 
  if that sort of issue came up , i 'd start looking into things like checking fingerprints with legal requirements that the log of those fingerprints be wiped after a week or having the readers receive a list of `` watchlisted '' fingerprints and simply check against them and never send out the prints or something like that . 
  the state i live in does take fingerprint data when it issues driver licenses . 
  i would imagine that some concern is that giving in on the current number may be used as a political lever to move in more people in the future . 
  let 's hypothetically say that eu members opposed to hosting migrants in the eu agreed to redistribution of the current migrants . 
  that represents a substantial move away from the position that they 'd like , both in terms of the situation on the ground and in setting a precedent that they do n't want . 
  what could they get in terms of guarantees as to the handling of future migrants ? 
  that is , what are the more-comfortable-with-taking-in-more-migrants countries like sweden and germany willing to concede on in return ? 
  because if the answer is `` nothing '' , i suspect that that looks like a bad move for v4 members -- it just shifts things away from where they want things to go . 
  could be saved and the pacific solution used . 
  they do n't want outside help because they 'd wind up likely to be responsible for all of them .
