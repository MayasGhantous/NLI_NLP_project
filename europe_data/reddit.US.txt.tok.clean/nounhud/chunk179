  the graph above shows how older democratic systems are much less likely to experience a legislative brawl . 
    in ukraine before the outbreak of the actual civil war , the legislature was plagued by credible commitment problems and thus by violence . 
  these conflicts were about gaining or preventing increases of future power . 
  ukrainian political parties and the national legislature are largely divided along linguistic and geopolitical lines . 
  pro-western parties dominate in the center and west of the country . 
  pro-russian parties dominate in the east and south . 
  each side presses for closer integration with either the european union or russia . 
  closer integration with europe , pro-russian ukrainians believed , would advantage pro-western politicians in the future . 
  pro-western politicians similarly fear moves that cement and increase russia 's presence in the country . 
    this was the situation in 2010 when a spectacular brawl occurred during the ratification of the treaty to continue leasing port facilities to russia 's black sea fleet . 
  other brawls have occurred over legislation to allow the use of the russian language in public institutions , and recently over decisions to send troops to fight separatist groups in eastern parts of the country . 
  i can already talk to a random french person on reddit , though . 
  jealousy of our desert island survival skills , no doubt . 
   cameron was also a twat i may add . 
  seems like moving the goalposts . 
  if the eu federalized , then there will be a congratulations call from the president and at that point , the eu will be treated as a single country , thumbs up or thumbs down , for visa waiver status . 
  but at the moment , not only has the eu not federalized , it has n't even been willing to include romania in schengen . 
  canada and the us do use a reciprocity-based system . 
  part of the grant is to require reciprocity . 
  it 's just that it 's not * only * reciprocity -- if botswana extends visa-free access , that is n't sufficient to guarantee visa-free access in return . 
  in the us , at least , the visa refusal rate needs to drop below a certain level for a certain period of time . 
  last i looked , poland was close , romania was not close , and bulgaria was not close * and * had an increasing refusal rate . 
  vote boycotts are n't normally very effective .

  it 's all relative . 
  on the other hand , you had a small force of obsolete [ buffalos ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/brewster_f2a_buffalo ) in the winter war and did pretty darn well with them -- a lot better than the us did against the japanese with the remaining us stocks . 
   of all the users , the finns were the most successful with their buffalos , flying them in combat against early soviet fighters with excellent results . 
  [ 4 ] during the continuation war of 1941 -- 1944 , the b-239s ( a de-navalized f2a-1 ) operated by the finnish air force proved capable of engaging and destroying most types of soviet fighter aircraft operating against finland at that time and achieving in the first phase of that conflict 32 soviet aircraft shot down for every b-239 lost , [ 5 ] and producing 36 buffalo `` aces '' .

  cameron 's well-to-do , right ? 
  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2013/dec/10/want-to-buy-citizenship-super-rich-malta-passports  spain grants a residency visa to foreign buyers who spend $ 500,000 ( # 418,000 ) or more on spanish property , though the wait for permanent residency and eu citizenship is five years . 
  he could still be there regardless of brexit . 
  the hell with being unobtrusive . 
  oh , a lot of people got screwed over . 
  just saying that cuba avoided genocide . 
  < thoughtful look  i do n't think that cuba saw it . 
   capitalism does the same thing , we 've just exported the misery elsewhere , but nobody calls the us the new usssr . 
  i do n't think that either capitalism or the us equate well to the ussr or the third reich . 
   why should america , with a smaller population and economy than the eu , keep underwriting europe 's security ? 
  technically , at the moment the us is larger economy-wise again . 
  what 's wrong with fingerprint readers at the gate , which should be functionally identical ? 
  why does it need 24 hour advance notice and paperwork ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malm%c3%b6  by 1971 , malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants , but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years . 
    population today : 318,107 [ detroit 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/detroit ) peak was in 1950 , at 1.8 m , declining most-precipitiously after race riots in the early 1970s . 
  it 's at 680k today and still declining . 
  detroit 's had rather a worse time of it .

  the eu [ presently has a free trade agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) with south korea . 
  it is working on one with vietnam . 
  it has agreements with chunks of africa and south america . 
  those are all areas with greater exposure to low-wage labor than the us . 
   i , for one , would n't give a flying fuck if russia would invade estonia again . 
  maybe you , personally , would not . 
  but france as a whole has signed up for both nato 's article 5 and for article 42 of the eu 's lisbon treaty , both of which commit france to defense of estonia . 
  nor do i particularly think that it would be advantageous to france for that mutual commitment to break up . 
  [ it is the future ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzre1k0fglw ) . 
   we already provide goods and services to the usa and they have to comply with us regulations . 
  yes . 
  but that 's only for those goods that are exported from the uk to the us . 
  to make the uk and the us a single market , the way the uk and the eu are at the moment , all businesses in both countries would have to conform to a single set of standards so that anything created or provided in either country could also be provided in the other . 
  [ all people in either country would need to be able to move to and from the other country . 
  all people in either country would need to be able to work in the other country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_market ) . 
  that could be done , yes . 
  it is not an impossibility . 
  but : * it took time and money for the uk and the other eu members to adopt the same standards . 
  it would take substantial time again to shift that . 
  * it is unlikely that the us will want to start spatting over territory with the eu . 
  you know how it 's infuriating to the uk to have juncker hinting that he 's going to encourage scotland to run off ? 
  you know how russia 's neighbors are furious about russia encouraging separatism ? 
  how it makes everyone involved pretty angry ? 
  that means that , in such a scenario , the uk would need to wrap up its relationship with the eu first independently . 
  that will alone take quite some time . 
  and aside from the `` it will take time to do this '' , issue there are still some barriers to this sort of thing that i 've not seen compelling answers to . 
  for a deal to be a strong , long-lived one , it needs to benefit both parties . 
  for the uk to spend the time and expense of leaving the eu 's single market and joining the us 's single market , it would need to be better off in a single market with the us than it is in a single market with other eu members . 
  how would this be the case ? 
  okay , i realize that people in the uk are upset about many , many guest workers right now , and , yes , it would probably reduce that insofar as us wages tend to be closer to and somewhat higher . 
  but theoretically , the eu should produce convergence , and so that * should * be a temporary situation . 
  and the relative drawbacks seem pretty significant : the european mainland is closer in timezone to the uk . 
  the european mainland is easier to travel to from the uk . 
  the european mainland is cheaper to ship goods to from the uk . 
  it takes less time to ship goods to the eu . 
  customs checks at calais would take a larger proportion of shipping time than customs checks at charleston , south carolina . 
  eliminating customs checks between the uk and the european mainland provides a larger relative benefit . 
  one current british concern is the uk 's financial services industry , which serves the eu , and which leaving the eu 's market would probably hurt . 
  the us does n't have a paucity of financial services . 
  the uk could certainly do business over here , but it 'd be competing on even ground ( not to mention the timezone differences above ) rather than dropping into a ready-made hole . 
  the us would probably be more-comfortable with some sort of economic-only relationship than the eu would , as it 's not trying to build a country . 
  but the eu would , i suspect , favor an economic relationship to having the uk run off . 
  i do n't think that the uk needs to really worry about the eu trying to force political union . 
  i think that some of our economic policies are better and more-globally-competitive . 
  but they are n't * that * dramatically different . 
  and i think that the eu is likely to keep getting more competitive . 
  broadly-speaking , us wages are somewhat-higher than uk wages ( though it 's obviously not as drastic a difference as on the order of , say , bulgaria and uk ) . 
  the uk may not see immigration -- you wo n't have lots of people from the poorest countries in the eu coming in to work , which i understand you 're up-in-arms about -- but it may see population drain , which would create the same issues that portugal sees . 
  in the sense that people are not happy about change produced by economic pressures ... membership in a single market with the us would probably produce more dramatic change in the uk of some form than is presently the case . 
  as i said above ... if folks in the uk are frustrated about only being a portion of the voice into setting the unified product standards in the eu ... the same would be more-or-less true of unified product standards spanning the us and the uk . 
  the us has not set up a single market with canada -- just a strong free trade agreement ( with some financial services being offered , admittedly ) . 
  if benefits of the us and canada entering a single market have n't been a sell to the canadian and us economic planners ... well , it seems to me that the benefits to the uk and the us would both be smaller . 
  the uk is very likely going to have a land border with ireland .
