  this effort failed -- it died out and was not seen as preferable to traditional families . 
  while i 'll bet that there 's some form of way of running this well , i suspect that it will take generations to get right . 
  nothing there seems to me to be technically non-viable ( the synthetic womb being the biggest difficulty ) . 
  it 's hard to get right , but it 's much in line with how society in all other areas has changed . 
  a 1950s-and-earlier-style `` woman is the homemaker '' approach seems horribly expensive , since you sacrifice half of your society 's specialized labor force . 
  that 's a major cut in your standards of living , were society to take up that model . 
  the only really compelling selling point to me is that it obviously can work ( since that was successfully functioning for most of human history ) , and that present-day societies that maintain population are using a model like this . 
  increasing financial incentives to have families ( tax the childless , subsidize those raising children ) is n't completely-crazy . 
  it internalizes a positive externality , particularly in welfare states -- the funding of the next generation that will pay into welfare . 
  however , skimming some articles about past efforts , this does n't seem to have been terribly-effective -- it would require knobs to be turned rather further than they have been , greater incentives than have existed to date . 
  it would probably annoy the * idiocracy * - quoting crowd , since a flat subsidy means that you primarily encourage childbirth among the unemployed , where the opportunity cost is the lowest . 
  propaganda to encourage people to raise children ... i 'm doubtful . 
  i 've never been terribly-enthusiastic about a government 's ability to shift social norms in the kind of open society that exists today . 
  put up all the propaganda posters you want ... i think that the public is going to keep pretty much the same views on children . 
  relying on immigration ... maybe . 
  it turns developed countries into a sort of meat grinder that kills their population off in exchange for a higher standard of living , and relies on the existence of some sort of undeveloped outside world perpetually remaining undeveloped in that 1950s-and-earlier `` woman is the homemaker '' model that can keep streaming people in . 
  i 'm not at all convinced that there are natural factors keeping this kind of system stable . 
   the two massive bookends on which the stability of such an organ would doubtless have to rest , the united states and india , are in any case disinclined toward such a plan ... central africa , nigeria , and india i dunno . 
  when i 've seen brits here talk about it . 
  * it did not include india . 
  * it often did not include the us . 
  and i assume that if it * did * , it would be accepted that it would be a us second preference to maintaining the eu that the us would simply fall into , the preferable option having been removed from the table . 
  * it certainly did not include central africa or nigeria . 
  a freedom-of-movement arrangement * has * been a popular idea with australia , new zealand , and canada . 
  that being said , i think that leaving the eu predicated on the expectation of such an arrangement without first lining something like that up , even if it were seen as a good idea by the british government ( which this is n't ) , would be crazy . 
  i see that they 're doing the `` hold the thing way up near the camera to look larger '' deal . 
   russian regime is doomed . 
  this lie is too blatant and crude even for putinvision . 
  i mean , [ last time ] ( http://dailycaller.com/2015/08/12/listen-to-russias-embarrassing-attempt-to-frame-the-u-s-for-a-terrorist-attack/ ) i remember seeing / r/europe complaining about this sort of thing , it was at least as bad . 
   in a nation where 90 % of the people earn living through agriculture , if you dump their market , they 're not going to go into another well paying industry , there simply is n't any . 
  i 'll grant that volatility could be a concern -- what i called `` patchy aid '' above . 
  that 's not inherent to a reduction in food price , though . 
   yes , it might work in a few decades , but not within the time frames , we 're talking about here . 
  wo n't be a negative for the country as a whole , though . 
   exporting food is n't easy , food expires and is strictly regulated ( in eu and usa ) . 
  that 's not what i 'm getting at -- i mean , i split up the two cases : * food produced for domestic consumption * food produced for export and talked about each . 
  i was n't saying `` okay , it 's necessary to shift agriculture that had targeted domestic consumption to export '' , but rather `` the export case is n't an issue either '' . 
  remember that an economy does n't exist to ensure that business exists -- businesses exist to ensure that needed resources are produced . 
  if you had everything you could want , you would n't care about running a business for the sake of running a business . 
  it [ looks like somalia does export food to some surrounding countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_somalia ) -- you 're right about it mostly not going to the eu or us , though . 
  well , there 's some sort of max on what humans on earth can produce food-wise , sure ... but the argument that / u/sanderudam was making was that reducing the market rate of food in somalia was a negative for somalia , which is different . 
   as far as i know you can get jailed or fined in most countries for insulting the head of state . 
  wow , you 're right . 
  well , maybe not `` most '' countries , but -- i had no idea that this was widespread in democratic governments . 
  [ wikipedia : l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 : europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a8se-majest%c3%a9#europe )  in ** denmark ** , the monarch is protected by the usual libel paragraph ( \u00a7 267 of the penal code which allows for up to four months of imprisonment [ snip ]  ** netherlands ** : for insulting the king , the heiress apparent , and their relatives , an offender may receive up to five years imprisonment plus a fine . 
  [ 10 ]   in october 2007 , a 47-year-old man was sentenced to one week imprisonment and fined $ 400 [ 11 ] for , amongst other things , l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 in the netherlands when he called queen beatrix a `` whore '' and told a police officer that he would have anal sex with her because `` she would like it '' .

  honestly , the only place i 'd heard of this existing in modern times was in thailand ( and for foreign dignitaries , iraq , where bush got a shoe thrown at him ) . 
  edit : and that 's not a complete list , either ; there are [ a few more prohibitions on insults of one 's own leader at wikipedia : freedom of speech by country : european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_speech_by_country#european_union ) :  ** germany ** : disparagement of the federal president ( section 90 ) . 
  [ snip ]  ** greece ** : it allows public prosecutors ( greek : \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 ) to order a confiscation of press ( or other ) publications ( after having been published , not before ) when the latter ... 14.3 . b : insult the president of greece , [ snip ]  ** france ** : restrictions on `` offending the dignity of the republic '' , on the other hand , include `` insulting '' anyone who serves the public ( potentially magistrates , police , firefighters , teachers and even bus conductors ) . 
  [ not sure whether this includes the president of france , though seems reasonable -- nounhud ], 
  i do n't think that / u/hegbork was so much talking about the severity of the punishment as pointing out that you were advocating punishing someone for holding an opinion ; this is very close to what freedom of speech itself covers . 
  that should not be a problem . 
  you do n't need a country to be an agricultural net exporter or even self-supporting , same as with any other industry ( well , okay , there are national security implications , but i 'm pretty sure that somalia taking on the west one-on-one is n't really a top concern at the moment ) . 
  let 's say that somalia receives its entire annual food supply , manna from heaven , bam . 
  well , now a bunch of people do n't need to produce food to feed themselves , so they are n't going to purchase food ... but that just means that they do the next-most-in-demand thing . 
  they are n't worse-off -- they just had their standard of living rise . 
  but what if farmers were exporting food ? 
  they can still export food -- it 's not as if receiving food prevents export , as long as that export is profitable . 
  it might reduce the size of the non-export agricultural sector in the country , but that 's not a problem . 
  and you can see why yourself . 
  put yourself in their shoes . 
  estonia [ imports and exports some food ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agriculture_in_estonia ) , though it 's [ not a huge chunk of the economy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_estonia ) . 
  let 's say that tomorrow , the us rolls up with a ton of all the food that estonia would have produced or imported and dumps it off . 
  would you consider estonia worse-off ? 
  there might be * individuals * who are worse-off -- maybe whatever overall increase in standard-of-living happens is not enough to be a positive for farmers who saw a huge disruption . 
  but for every euro of food that they did n't produce , someone else in estonia got a euro of food without having to trade for it -- it 's necessarily a net positive in that simple form . 
  i 'm guessing that you 're not a farmer . 
  would you consider yourself worse-off if your food budget suddenly dropped to zero ? 
  i doubt it -- you 'd go take your money and invest it , or buy something to increase your standard of living , or do something else . 
  you do n't need to work for the food portion of your daily life now . 
  with the resources that estonia now has available that do n't need to be devoted to either producing food or trading for food , it can go do something else . 
  now , i will concede that this is simplified . 
  in the real world , you could theoretically have some effect that 's outside of just modeling the above -- like , maybe there 's some death cult running around that treats an excess of food as a terrible thing , and goes on some sort of rampage or something . 
  but that 's not typically , i think , what people are thinking about , and i suspect that things like that rarely come up enough to make conventional models terribly inaccurate . 
  and there are a few other risks -- like , let 's say that the food aid was patchy , where in no year did you know whether there 'd be food coming in . 
  so in one year , farmers choose not to plant , expecting food aid ... and no food aid shows up , and there 's a famine . 
  but , again , that seems like something that 's reasonable to work around . 
  certainly , neither of the two above issues can be reduced to `` decreasing the market rate of food is bad '' . 
  preventing someone who has received asylum status from working is a violation of the [ refugee convention ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention ) . 
   chapter iii : gainful employment   article 17 . 
    wage-earning employment   1 . 
  the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the most favourable treatment accorded to nationals of a foreign country in the same circumstances , as regards the right to engage in wage-earning employment . 
  it is possible to restrict freedom of labor while someone 's asylum status is still being evaluated , which the refugee convention does not bound ( and has probably been somewhat-abused as an immigration rate-limiter ) . 
  nice to have the number , but that does n't seem to be directly-comparable , yes ? 
  that 's only long-term unemployment , and it 's being compared to both long - and short-term unemployment . 
  i dunno ... i think that there 's a natural tendency to focus on the flaws , since that 's what people are going to talk about . 
  i mean , okay , let 's say that warlord x uses food as a source of income ... it 's still dumping food onto the market and decreasing market rate . 
  hmm . 
  you sure ? 
  i 'd assume that they were just taking all birth defects and asking whether the marriage was a cousin marriage . 
  i suspect that the bulk of cousin marriages in the world happen where cousin marriages are more socially acceptable/prevalent , and if so , that statistic would effectively account for multi-generational effects . 
  would n't per-capita numbers be more interesting ? 
   and then the middle generation would be able to do their work without worrying about the children . 
  i dunno ... i have no idea how much time people actually spent child-rearing their children .
