  eliminating difficulties there is a significant perk of being in a single market with ireland . 
  i mean ... sure , i 'm happy to do business with the uk and all that . 
  if the uk definitely leaves the eu , i think that it would be advantageous to both to lowering barriers to doing business . 
  i expect that we 'll sign a free trade agreement of some sort in time if that happens . 
  but my strong suspicion is that the us is being seen by some brits as more of a drop-in replacement for the eu than it is or can realistically be ( `` hey , gdp is comparable ... why not ? '' ) . 
  if the us were located where ireland was , then that 'd be different . 
  that being said , if the uk is hell-bent on getting out , okay , i mean , i 'd personally be up for looking at it . 
  but i think that the actual economic impact of `` swap us for eu '' is being seen through rose-tinted glasses by a lot of people who are currently pissed off with brussels . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/french+guiana/@3.9277433,-55.3321734,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8d12155785f7d753:0xde27f7e90f0af446!8m2!3d3.933889!4d-53.125782 ), 
  the eu has added isds into earlier trade agreements that it cut with other countries . 
  how do canada or the us differ here ? 
  maybe one day it could , if that 's what both wanted . 
  but it 's extremely unlikely to happen in the near term . 
  it took a long time for the uk to harmonize her regulations with the rest of the eu , and it 'd require doing all that all over again , starting from scratch . 
  also , if people in the uk objected to only being a voice in product standards unified at brussels ... i 'm not sure that i see how the same sort of thing , but with washington , would be dramatically more palatable . 
  i imagine that wealthy people also enjoy ham sandwiches . 
  you going to abstain because it 's nice for 'em too?i, 
   lets be honest here.this doesnt solve the problem.it just moves it somewhere far from `` us '' . 
  libya is n't actually that far from sicily . 
  now , now . 
  we have n't done that since nagasaki . 
  add a blank line between paragraphs , and it 'll be way easier to read your post . 
  reddit uses markdown , which merges paragraphs if they do n't have that blank line . 
  i 'm not sure that the issue is as much the birthing as it is the raising . 
  `` dr. whitman , are n't you supposed to be finishing your grant proposal ? 
  why in god 's name are you wearing an ss uniform and carrying a harpoon gun ? '', 
  it 's cg . 
  how so ? 
  my understanding is that in government , he was n't particularly deeply interested in domestic reforms and was n't terribly ideological along party issue grounds . 
  hmm .

  * politicians in eu member make bullshit promises about what they can get from hard-line negotiation with the eu given a particular referendum outcome . 
  * voters believe them , vote as instructed . 
  * government 's representative goes to eu , falls flat , gets told that they are n't getting what they promised . 
  * everyone winds up worse-off . 
  it 's happened now both in greece and the uk . 
   wilders had started his own party in 2006 when trump gets traction in 2016 . 
  trump had goofy hair before wilders , though . 
  in what way would you want your country to change relative to the current status ? 
  i do n't think that applies . 
  * the posts in question were apparently before the mp seat was held . 
  * `` immunity '' seemed too broad . 
  [ i checked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_immunity#germany ) , and it is indeed quite limited :  article 46 of germany 's constitution states : `` at no time may a member be subjected to court proceedings or disciplinary action or otherwise called to account outside the bundestag for a vote cast or for any speech or debate in the bundestag or in any of its committees , '' with exceptions made for `` defamatory insults . '', 
  the bundestag can vote to lift immunity for specific members , and to allow prosecution in cases relating to alleged criminal activity . 
  the bundestag may also order that a detainment or prosecution of a member be suspended . 
  [ 7 ] that 's just for speech and just in the bundestag itself , so that people can debate things freely . 
   so , we return to that gold at the end of the rainbow that we 'd be looking for if we seek a european federation : another `` glue '' to replace nationalism at the pan-european level . 
  well , if you do n't want eu nationalism , you 've got religion and political ideology that i can think of . 
  i think that an `` eu nationalism '' identity is probably the best of those options . 
  minimize the harmful side , create a few soundbite items and symbols -- europe 's bull charging , etc , make something that football fans can get behind . 
  religion would , i think , be hard to force and generally slow to adapt . 
  it unified europe once , loosely , but forcing identity to rely on religion had obvious costs still visible.in the islamic world . 
  political ideology -- like communism -- requires an ongoing revolution to be sustained . 
  i think that that is difficult to maintain . 
   but ranting aside , i think it 's okay to say `` hey , nationalism sucks , it 's outdated , we need something else '' although i do n't have a packaged solution ready . 
  i 'm looking with excitement for heirs apparent , and if anyone has any good ideas or something worth reading they are also more than welcome to send me a link either here or as a pm . 
  well , you 've got bits of the eu breaking off . 
  you also have a solution that you know works . 
  if you want to experiment with post-nationalist structures , maybe this is n't the best context for it . 
   you do n't allow them to work outside of their assigned district . 
  you do n't pay them welfare outside of their assigned district . 
  you fine them if you apprehend them outside of their assigned district . 
  violates the refugee convention , unless by `` district '' you mean `` country '' . 
  https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention  article 18 . 
    self-employment   the contracting states shall accord to a refugee lawfully in their territory treatment as favourable as possible and , in any event , not less favourable than that accorded to aliens generally in the same circumstances , as regards the right to engage on his own account in agriculture , industry , handicrafts and commerce and to establish commercial and industrial companies . 
  [ snip ]  article 26 . 
    freedom of movement   each contracting state shall accord to refugees lawfully in its territory the right to choose their place of residence and to move freely within its territory subject to any regulations applicable to aliens generally in the same circumstances . 
  if you do mean `` country '' , blocking movement within schengen will not be easy . 
   one way to go would be to introduce one common eu migrant/refugee welfare support on the level of the poorest members of the eu . 
  violates the refugee convention : https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1951_refugee_convention  article 23 . 
    public relief   the contracting states shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals . 
  you would need to withdraw from the refugee convention to do this legally . 
   the problem with defending the purity of the english language is that english is about as pure as a cribhouse whore . 
  we do n't just borrow words ; on occasion , english has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary . 
  -- [ james nicoll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_nicoll ), 
  fair enough . 
  the future european union 's official languages will be finnish and proto-indo-european . 
   also , the pie dictionary is rather limited . 
  well , `` computer '' can be `` big bright rock '' or something like that . 
  i 'd rather replace one conservative justice with another , honestly . 
  [ hitler was a vegetarian ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_hitler_and_vegetarianism ) . 
  i dunno what exactly is in that burger patty , but i 'm not eating it . 
  if one wants pure political correctness , one could use as much of [ proto-indo-european ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-indo-european_language ) as we 've reconstructed , as it 's the ancestor of all of europe 's languages . 
  fragmented . 
  arguably not a single language . 
  the chinese spoken language is badly fragmented and probably should n't be classified as a single language . 
  if you 're just trying to piss off the brits , i think that 's kinda counterproductive and petty . 
  but for the sake of discussion ... india is steadily heading down the english route , so hindi ( the closest alternative to a standard outside the state languages ) probably is n't competitive . 
  spanish is a european language and the only real language competitive in number of speakers . 
  however , almost all of those are in the americas , and while they are n't africa-poor , they are n't a huge piece of the global economy ( yet , at any rate ) . 
  ... which we do . 
  and at some point , the netherlands just gave in : http://www.holland.com/global/tourism.htm  welcome to holland.com , the official website of the netherlands board of tourism and conventions , where you receive all the information for your visit to ... 
  word of advice : if you rename your country because cnn gets it wrong , we 're gon na be seeing a lot of country name changes . 
  i do that with claims of fascism and communism . 
  so we * should * be using `` kekia '' ? 
  i 'd prefer using `` chesko '' to `` czech republic '' . 
  we applaud the sacrifice of all cheks in chekland . 
  i think that you 're missing context . 
  countries have been supplying explicitly non-lethal aid for some time . 
  afghanistan was more divided than ukraine , frankly .
