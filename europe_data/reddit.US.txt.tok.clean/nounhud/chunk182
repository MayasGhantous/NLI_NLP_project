  5 of the residence act , a foreigner may not be deported if deportation is inadmissible under the terms of the convention on human rights . 
  section 60 subs . 
  5 of the residence act hence does not contain a separate regulation , but only refers to the convention in a declaratory manner and to the prohibition of deportation which results from the convention . 
  prohibition of deportation in accordance with section 60 subs . 
  7 of the residence act   prohibition of deportation in accordance with section 60 subs . 
  7 of the residence act is to be granted if the foreigner faces a substantial concrete danger or an extreme general danger on return to the destination state . 
    protection against deportation in accordance with section 60 subs . 
  7 of the residence act is asserted in particular ( but not exhaustively ) if for instance the danger of a considerable worsening of an existing illness is likely because of inadequate medical treatment in the destination state , or if such treatment is not available at all . 
    date 20 june 2014 if the people involved are n't stupid , they 'll be using immigration lawyers to look for loopholes to try to at least defer deportation even if an asylum claim fails . 
  we do n't have the `` human dignity '' legal concept in the us , but my understanding is that it is vaguely-defined .

  iirc , duty-to-rescue laws typically limit the requirement where there is danger to the actor involved . 
  there are two different things . 
  [ ** good samaritan laws ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_samaritan_law ) these deal with the liability of someone who chooses to give aid . 
  that is , if they choose to help someone in distress , they can not be sued for any harm -- for example , if they pull someone from a burning vehicle and cause spinal damage , the victim can not sue them for paralyzing them . 
  there is no federal law in the us along these lines , but us states do provide this immunity at the state level . 
  this is fairly common internationally . 
  in practice , i doubt that lawsuits like this are a major issue even without such laws -- that such laws simply make explicit and guaranteed what courts in practice . 
  [ ** duty to rescue ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duty_to_rescue ) this is a legal requirement to give aid . 
  the us does not have this at a federal level ; a few us states have very weak forms of this . 
  this is much more-common in europe . 
  the way my criminal law textbook put it years back , using an extreme example -- `` in the us , it 's legal for susan , an olympic swimmer , to stand at the edge of a pool and laugh as john , who can not swim , drowns '' . 
  this is less-common , but this is what i was bringing up for germany . 
  that does n't make it legal . 
  it means that if they can prove a particular status , they wo n't be punished for being present illegally . 
  here 's the actual text from the refugee convention , which explicitly calls it illegal :  1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article i , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  finally , i might also add that due to the direct travel limitation , this clause is inapplicable to all people illegally immigrating to europe other than * possibly * directly from libya , those who might have somehow hopped a long-range cargo ship directly from the country in question , or managed a direct air fight without connection .

   far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun . 
    orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea . 
    this planet has -- or rather had -- a problem , which was this : most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time . 
  many solutions were suggested for this problem , but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper , which is odd because on the whole it was n't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy . 
    and so the problem remained ; lots of the people were mean , and most of them were miserable , even the ones with digital watches . 
    many were increasingly of the opinion that they 'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place . 
  and some said that even the trees had been a bad move , and that no one should ever have left the oceans .

  not sure that failing to provide shelter would actually be legal in germany . 
  would be okay in the us : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duty_to_rescue  in the common law of most anglosphere countries , there is no general duty to come to the rescue of another . 
  [ 1 ] [ snip ]  in germany , `` unterlassene hilfeleistung '' ( failure to provide assistance ) is an offense according to section 323c [ 35 ] of the strafgesetzbuch ; a citizen is obliged to provide help in case of accident or general danger if necessary , and is normally immune from prosecution if assistance given in good faith and following the average reasonable person 's understanding of required measures turns out to be harmful .

  two thousand years ago , the italians and greeks considered themselves a superior , sophisticated people and the germanic peoples inferior and uncivilized . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbarian  the romans indiscriminately regarded the various germanic tribes , the settled gauls , and the raiding huns as barbarians . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_peoples  the term `` germanic '' originated in classical times when groups of tribes living in lower , upper , and greater germania were referred to using this label by roman scribes . 
  the roman use of the term `` germanic '' was not necessarily based upon language , but rather referred to the tribal groups and alliances that lived in the regions of modern-day luxembourg , belgium , the netherlands , and germany , and which were considered to be less civilized and more physically hardened than the celtic gauls . 
  tribes referred to as `` germanic '' by roman authors generally lived to the north and east of the gauls . 
  [ snip ]  modern germanic peoples include the afrikaners , austrians , danes , dutch , english , flemish , frisians , germans , icelanders , lowland scots , norwegians , swedes and others ( including diaspora populations , such as some european americans ) . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ snip ]  roman authors frequently employed the term `` barbarian '' from the latin derivative barbarus ( inherited from the greek barbaros which means `` foreign '' ) when describing germanic peoples . 
  such a term presupposed a distinctive roman intellectual and cultural superiority and their ethnographic treatises on the various `` barbarian '' tribes ascribed specific attributes of barbarism to each one so as to delineate the dichotomy between barbarism and civilization . 
  while it 's clear that americans uniquely break the mold in actually being definitely superior ( :-) ) , the delusion of being a superior people afflicted many other peoples incorrectly around the world through history , consistently tracking whoever had the big , wealthy empire of the moment : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_exceptionalism  similar beliefs have existed historically elsewhere in the world , such as whig history in britain which held that the political system of the british empire was the apex of human development and uniquely suited to ruling foreign peoples benignly , and sinocentrism in china , which regarded chinese culture as more ancient than or superior to other cultures and neighboring countries as mere offshoots of china , although neither of these views is common in the present day .

  stalin pushed for it after the finns reopened the [ continuation war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war ) to retake the land that the soviets had taken from finland . 
  the non-soviet allied countries were not sympathetic with stalin as regards finland , and the commonwealth countries took no significant action and the us was not willing to declare war at all , but did not want the rail link between the allies and the soviet armies in the field against germany cut off by finland ( which , obviously , germany very much * did * want to have happen ) , as the finns were clobbering soviet forces in the beginning of the continuation war . 
   finland maintained good relations with the western powers . 
  the finnish government stressed that finland was fighting as a co-belligerent with germany against the soviet union only to protect itself . 
  [ 84 ] furthermore , finland stressed that it was still the same democratic country as it had been in the winter war . 
  however , on 12 july 1941 , the united kingdom signed an agreement of joint action with the soviet union . 
  furthermore , under german pressure , finland had to close the british legation in helsinki . 
  as a result , diplomatic relations between finland and the united kingdom were broken on 1 august . 
  [ 86 ] on 28 november , britain presented finland an ultimatum demanding that finland cease military operations by 3 december . 
  [ 87 ] unofficially , finland informed the western powers that finnish troops would halt their advance in the next few days . 
  the reply did not satisfy the united kingdom , which declared war on finland on 6 december . 
  the commonwealth member states of canada , australia , british raj , and new zealand followed suit . 
  [ 88 ] [ note 7 ]   relations between finland and the united states were more complex ; the american public was sympathetic to the `` brave little democracy '' , and there were anti-communist feelings . 
  at first , the united states empathised with the finnish cause ; however , the situation became problematic after finnish troops crossed the 1939 border .
