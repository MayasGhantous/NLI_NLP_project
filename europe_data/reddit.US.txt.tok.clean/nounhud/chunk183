  [ 89 ] finnish and german troops were a threat to the murmansk railway and northern communication supply line between the western allies and the soviet union . 
  [ 90 ] on 25 october 1941 , the united states demanded that finland cease all hostilities against the soviet union and withdraw behind the 1939 border . 
  in public , president ryti rejected the demands , but in private he wrote to mannerheim on 5 november , asking him to halt the offensive . 
  mannerheim agreed and secretly instructed general hjalmar siilasvuo to break off the assault against the murmansk railway . 
  [ 87 ] [ snip ]  the continuation war represents the only case of a genuinely democratic state participating in world war ii on the side of the axis powers , albeit without being a signatory of the tripartite pact . 
  the united kingdom declared war on finland on 6 december 1941 ( finnish independence day ) , with canada and new zealand declaring war on finland on 7 december and australia and south africa declaring war the next day . 
  u.s. secretary of state cordell hull congratulated the finnish envoy on 3 october 1941 for the liberation of karelia but warned finland not to enter soviet territory ; furthermore , the united states did not declare war on finland when it went to war alongside the axis countries and , together with the uk , approached soviet premier joseph stalin at the tehran conference about acknowledging finnish independence . 
  however , the u.s. government seized finnish merchant ships in american ports , and in the summer of 1944 shut down finnish diplomatic and commercial offices in the united states as a result of president ryti 's treaty with germany . 
  the u.s. government later warned finland about the consequences of continued adherence to the axis . 
  [ 113 ]   the best-known british action on finnish soil was an aircraft carrier strike on german and finnish ships in the finnish harbour of petsamo on 31 july 1941 . 
  [ 13 ] this attack achieved little except the loss of three british aircraft , but it was intended as a demonstration of british support for its soviet ally . 
  later in 1941 , hurricanes of no . 
  151 wing raf , based at murmansk , provided local air cover for soviet troops and fighter escorts for soviet bombers . 
  [ 114 ]   finnish radio intelligence is said to have participated effectively in german actions against british convoys to murmansk . 
  [ 115 ] throughout the war , german aircraft operating from airfields in northern finland attacked british air and naval units based in murmansk and archangelsk . 
  complicated set of international interactions . 
  combined with the [ lapland war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lapland_war ) where finland was required to declare war on germany , it meant that at some point , finland was at war ( albeit technically ) with most of the major powers in the bulk of world war ii . 
  this may require modern , scientific measures , like [ radioactive toothpaste ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doramad_radioactive_toothpaste ) or [ a good drink of some thoroughly irradiated water ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radium_ore_revigator ) .

  [ dolphin energy healing ] ( http://www.dolphinhealing.net/ ) is where it 's at . 
  absolutely , and the b-52s carrying the bombs would be trailing red white and blue acrobatic smoke while doing so . 
  maybe . 
  reagan only [ invaded grenada ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_grenada ) . 
  and , frankly , i suspect that the bureaucracy 's recommendations are more-important than presidential whims . 
  why would the us bomb russia in that case ? 
  nato would just send soldiers into lithuania . 
  if russian artillery were firing from russia into lithuania as happened in ukraine , then , yeah , i 'd imagine that that would be bombed . 
  soviet fighter pilots and us pilots [ were shooting each other down during the korean war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_war ) , and both were nuclear powers at that point . 
  [ us nukes were deployed to the area , and presidential authority delegated to military commanders to use them if it became vital ] ( http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/how-korean-war-almost-went-nuclear-180955324/?no-ist ) , but it never happened . 
  was n't really much point , anyway , as [ conventional bombing wiped out everything built-up in north korea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aftermath_of_the_korean_war#korea ) , and there were n't really any fantastic targets for nuclear weapons left . 
   according to figures published in the soviet union , around 1.13 million people , or 11.1 % of the total population , were killed in north korea ( with the total casualties of some 2.5 million ) . 
  more than 80 % of the industrial and public facilities and transportation infrastructure , three-quarters of all government buildings , and half of all housing was destroyed . 
  both south korea and north korea were bombed , but the damage was far greater in north korea . 
  many north koreans took to living in caves , or other shelter . 
  midway through the war , american pilots found that they had no more targets to bomb , every significant target had already been destroyed . 
  also , there 's the [ falklands war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falklands_war ) , where the brits had nukes . 
  argentina clearly did n't consider british nukes to be a realistic concern for them in invading and annexing an admittedly small part of british territory . 
  edit : and i should also add that the brits were in the air fighting in the korean war as well and by the end of the war had detonated their own nuclear weapons . 
  hmmm . 
  [ according to wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cost_of_the_olympic_games ) , we 've hosted it four times and made money off it three of those times . 
  and the time we lost money , the 1980 lake placid winter olympics , it was only $ 8.5 m in the hole and the olympic village was [ built from the beginning to be a new prison ] ( http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-time-that-the-us-turned-an-olympic-village-into-a-prison ) , and we just housed the athletes in the cells , which avoided the issue of a useless boondoggle afterwards . 
  go paris and budapest !, 
   this , we really need to start investing money in stuff that will pay off in 10-30 years . 
  young germans ? 
  well , presumably childless pensioners would like to use their savings to live on during that same old age where lack of government support would be an issue . 
  i mean , it 's one of : * `` sorry , turns out that there 's no money for a pension . 
  work until you 're no longer employable and if you do n't have enough savings to make up the rest , then jump off a bridge . '', 
  * `` sorry , turns out that all your life savings are gone ... had to take them to cover pensions . 
  you 're going to be living on pension alone , a rather meager retirement . '', 
  hmm . 
  okay . 
  my understanding is that the main mechanism in the us for fiscal transfers is via progressive taxation by the federal government ( which automatically taxes wealthier areas more by taxing wealthier people more ) and then spending on a relatively flat basis , mostly on social security to the elderly and medicare ( healthcare for the elderly ) , and to a lesser degree via military spending , veteran 's benefits , and well down the food chain , federal subsidies for agriculture , education , science , and so forth . 
  because that spending is n't normally presented as dealing with competitive issues , but rather providing services that are either unaffordable for poorer states or simply not within the state 's responsibility , i 've never really thought about competitive effects until the whole debate about eu transfer payments brought it up . 
  you are greek , and i would assume that you do n't consider yourself `` shit '' . 
  greece has problems at the moment . 
  but ... it 's not inherently ... damn . 
  english does n't have the term i want , the difference between `` ser '' and `` estar '' in spanish . 
  it 's not that greeks * inherently * have problems , but that greeks * at the moment * have problems . 
  all this kicking of greeks , i think , is unlikely to do much to fix it , either . 
  self-kicking or not . 
  it makes me a bit ill to see eu members beating up on each others ' peoples rather than each others ' current institutions . 
  well , how about one large agreement where both happen ? 
  you do n't , as i understand it , need the ability to devalue currency . 
  a trade balance will always prevail in the long term . 
  you will lay people off periodically and rehire them back at lower wages , and that will have some of the same effect , albeit more-disruptive ( you keep having people out of work ) . 
  what i mean is that by my understanding , it would make taking out a larger amount of debt viable for members with shakier economies . 
  and that 's an influx of wealth one time -- the member could take out a larger chunk of its gdp in debt while paying the same amount . 
  but , well ... then it 's done . 
  then greece has the same amount they 're paying to service the debt , a larger debt , and no more wealth coming in . 
  sure , in one sense greece got more funds in that it could take out more debt , and you could compare that to a world where somehow lenders let it take out a totally unsustainable amount of debt . 
  greece would be `` saving '' on debt payments then . 
  but ... in reality , those lenders probably would n't lend that out . 
  if greece * defaulted * on her debt , then germany would be liable for covering those losses . 
  and then the cycle would start all over again at zero debt . 
  but ... that seems like a really undesirable way to try to transfer wealth from germany to greece , if that is a goal . 
  it seems unpredictable and gives the liable parties ( germany ) no control over the rate of transfer ( greece can keep happily defaulting ) , which does n't seem great either . 
  if a goal in the eu -- and maybe it 's not -- is to try to find underdeveloped areas or poverty-stricken people and to provide them with funds , then that needs an ongoing mechanism to transfer funds , not just a one-off way . 
  :-( hmm . 
  it might make sense to move pension funding to be an eu responsibility , if you 're going to have freedom of labor at the eu level . 
  i 'm pretty much a classical liberal , and no fan of hefty government services ... and that does prevent states from competing on pension policy ... but if one is going to have pensions , they should n't be gameable . 
  and freedom of labor should n't result in the elderly in a member country being rendered destitute . 
  fwiw , the us keeps most policies at a state level , but social security is federal . 
  in fact , even if one is living and working abroad , one has to pay into social security . 
  i 'm not sure that i like the us `` you still have to pay income tax in general if you 're living abroad in a low-tax jurisdiction '' thing , but the social security payments do seem necessary , as one retains the right to draw from them .

  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=vaxxed+said+filmmakers ) . 
  i 'm not sure how heavy that thing actually is . 
  i understand that , but that seems like only a one-time transfer -- not , barring a default , a way to persistently transfer wealth . 
  can you describe how public pensions in the eu are working , then ? 
  they do n't seem to make sense to me . 
  my understanding is that the eu has not yet established a common public pension system . 
  if i 'm portuguese , i assume that paying into the state pension system is mandatory if i 'm working in portugal , or the pension system would n't be solvent . 
  if i 'm portuguese and working in germany , do i need to pay into the german system , and gain the ability to draw from it ? 
  http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/retire-abroad/state-pensions-abroad/index_en.htm that * sounds * like what 's happening . 
  but ... that does n't seem sustainable . 
  it means that germany is essentially transferring the costs of europe 's low birth rates to poorer eu members -- their pension systems will have lots of old people and no young and will have to stop paying out . 
  it also [ sounds like people moving around the eu are losing their pension contributions in some cases to the countries that they 've worked in ] ( https://www.toytowngermany.com/wiki/pension_refunds_on_leaving_germany ) , which also seems disadvantageous to poorer members and advantageous to wealthier members .
