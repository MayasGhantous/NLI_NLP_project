    duterte was speaking before repatriated overseas filipino workers at the ninoy aquino international airport terminal 2 in pasay city . 
    `` i like putin ... we have similarities , '' he added . 
    when asked to elaborate about his similarities with putin , duterte replied : `` perhaps when it comes to girls . '', 
  guy certainly is a fountain of quotes for the press . 
  http://www.update.ph/2016/05/european-union-spain-looking-forward-to-duterte-presidency/5579  both the eu and spain said they look forward to working closely with duterte 's administration . 
  bliss !, 
  eh , on the scale of things national leaders do , being insulting seems pretty minor . 
  when you say `` northern europe '' , are you including germany in that definition ? 
  well , whether or not what the us did is a good idea , it did so during a recession . 
  looking at italy 's rate of gdp growth , it 's low but not in a recession . 
  i 'd guess that the two would thus be in different positions . 
  hmmm . 
  why is that less of an issue ? 
  if germany defaulted on its pensioners , i assume that that 's be pretty bad for them , yes ? 
  mentioning that the uk has internal fiscal transfers seems germane , though . 
  do n't all portuguese , regardless of where in the eu they are working , contribute to portugal 's pension system ? 
  if not , i agree that that seems problematic . 
  i am not familiar with eurobonds , but i do n't understand how they 'd be a good way to have germany permanently transferring money to italy . 
  for eurobonds to act as a transfer mechanism in the long term , would n't italy have to default on a regular basis and have germany cover the losses ? 
  whether you agree with him or not , my understanding is that keynes did n't say that running a deficit was an inherent good . 
  he advocated for it as a way to respond to a recession . 
  italy is not in a recession . 
  hmm . 
  wikipedia notes that finland has unusually light sentencing for rape :  convicted rapists receive very short penalties compared to other countries , although this may be due to the fact that finland has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the world . 
  during 2001 -- 2003 , the average sentence for rape was two years ' imprisonment , and only 63 % of offenders served their sentences in prison , as 37 % of sentences were conditional . 
  the average sentence for aggravated rape was four years ' imprisonment . 
  for the offense of coercion into sexual intercourse , sentences were most often one year conditional imprisonment , but only 4 % of offenders went to prison . 
  what i means is that maybe the tradeoffs for diesel make achieving those levels not worthwhile for a diesel passenger car . 
  for the us , that 's irrelevant . 
  but for the eu , that 's a major cost . 
  i mean , there 's inertia to that sort of thing . 
  hmmm ... well , it can be done with urea . 
  maybe a better solution would be to have a single smart nozzle with multiple lines that can replace * all * the car 's fluids when filling it up , to make the urea less of a hassle . 
  hell , if you really want to be fancy ... we have n't updated the fuel pump since forever . 
  make your fuel pump smart enough to automatically find the gas socket and connect itself , so you get automated full service and do n't even have to get out of the car . 
  that lets car manufacturers provide a value-add instead of a drawback , and it 's going to be even more useful in a self-driving car era . 
  the car brands here are not , as i understand it , sold in the us . 
  i do n't think that the us public is up in arms about air quality in european cities . 
  i mean , the article is from a european publication complaining about a european report and european standards on european-built cars sold in europe and driven in european cities . 
  the only reference to the us was the fact that there was a crackdown on the defeat device-equipped cars sold in the us . 
  even if you would n't agree with the us on us emissions limits , i do n't see how the us could reasonably catch blame on this article . 
   and 5 years is actually a long sentence for rape . 
  http://www.sexoffenderattorney.com/resources/criminal-defense/rape/criminal-penalties-a-rape-conviction  across the united states , the average prison time for rape is between 8 and 9 years . 
  this is a brit publication . 
  yeah , but the us is also gasoline-based , not diesel . 
  there 's a certain irony in complaining about the brit domestic politicians dumping on the eu for domestic political benefit without care for eu level consequences and this guy doing what i 'd call the same thing . 
  might play well domestically , but i doubt that it 's good diplomacy . 
  in all fairness , while i do n't think that brexit is a good idea ... mocking the brits for celebrating independence leaves a bad taste in my mouth . 
  many countries celebrate independence , and many similar complaints were mobbed at them -- not being able to operate independently as well . 
  that was written a few years after the us [ chinese exclusion act ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_exclusion_act ) went through . 
   dmitri alperovitch , chief technical director of cyber security company crowdstrike , said : `` we 've seen how two russian espionage groups hack the same systems to steal the same data . 
  western secret services do n't usually do this , as they are anxious not to harm each other 's operations . '', 
  jeez . 
  get with the program . 
  sure , but his complaint was n't that db was catching flak for a particular set of actions . 
  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mountebank  a dishonest person : a person who tricks and cheats other people in the past , i 've seen / u/savannajeff provide explanations of a number of trade-related issues . 
  he 's provided a couple of expert answers to my questions on things that i did n't know about , like indicating that dumping was a mainstream concern in international trade , but the * infant industries * argument was not . 
  the last time you and i were in a major thread discussion on here , i think that you just kept copy-pasting some quote about how truth was hidden and claiming that i could n't know anything about the world , that western news media was lies and how i should give equal credence to rt as to any statement from a western government or news source . 
  i do n't think that he 's a mountebank . 
  why ? 
   not even many californians at this point , because they are currently fleeing en masse for places that are dirt cheap ( like texas ) because of the drought and skyrocketing housing prices . 
  you 're thinking of the bay area . 
  there is lots of inland land that 's cheap in california . 
  hot , dry , but cheap . 
  sure , [ san francisco is expensive ] ( https://www.redfin.com/city/17151/ca/san-francisco ) , and has badly failed to authorize enough construction to keep up with housing demand . 
  but [ barstow is n't ] ( https://www.redfin.com/city/1084/ca/barstow ) . 
  i 'm gon na be honest , a nazi cartoon done by [ * doctor seuss * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dr._seuss ) , of all people , was not what i was expecting to see . 
  i personally doubt that the us , given the current set of alliances and the military balance of power , would attempt a limited nuclear attack . 
  the only reason russia is talking about doing so is because russia currently does n't really have a great response in a conventional war , so russia needs to threaten use of nuclear weapons in a conventional conflict . 
  in the era right after world war ii , the situation was reversed -- europe was torn up and in no position to do much , and the us had demobilized and did n't have the ability to stop an invasion into western europe from the ussr using only conventional forces , so threatened use of nuclear weapons . 
  as the balance of conventional force shifted away from russia , russia lowered the bar to use of nuclear weapons because she needed the threat to be available , and the us raised it because she did n't need the threat to be available . 
  if a conflict actually went to the point of the us using nuclear weapons , my assumption is that the us goal would be to get off a successful first strike and wipe out all or almost all ability to strike back . 
  i doubt that that would be done in any situation short of believing that a nuclear attack was a serious risk and that the expected cost of the certain all-out response with anything left would be less . 
  / u/doeboy73 said `` centillion '' . 
  that 's fixed for the hypothetical situation here ... but the term results in two different exponents depending upon the system used . 
  according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/observable_universe ... the mass of the observable universe is 10 ^ 53 kg . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/10413/how-much-does-a-large-potato-weigh ) , a potato is about a fifth of a kilogram . 
  depending upon whether we 're using the [ us and british system or the italian and french system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/long_and_short_scales ) , we 're looking at 10 ^ 303 or 10 ^ 600 potatoes . 
  needless to say , this would be far more than the current mass of the universe under either system and would presumably cause the universe to collapse back on itself , centered somewhere in eastern europe . 
  theories : * it attracts media attention . 
  that 's good if you want to make an appeal . 
  * if there is n't any housing , maybe there 's pressure to take people to mainland europe . 
  i mean , are you going to just let people stay outside , exposed to the elements ? 
  * might just be a less-than-planned `` i 'm pissed and going to express that by burning down buildings '' . 
  not everything in the world is following some plan . 
  my understanding is that the single market is not an fta -- it is what provides access to goods and services with identical regulatory standards on each side , so that a good sold in one eu member can automatically also be sold in another without any further restrictions . 
  that 's stronger than an fta , which does not unify regulatory standards . 
  an fta should cover tariffs on agricultural goods , though , and i would not expect to see a tariff between the eu and the uk . 
  that 's kind of you , but ... i 'm having a hard time agreeing . 
  what eu institutions are closer to their soviet counterparts than their us counterparts ? 
   plus , to hit br\u00fcssel , you will need to fly with a nuke over germany or france . 
  these are not easy to stop . 
  the us still has n't built a missile shield capable of blocking any more than a miniscule portion of russia 's ballistic arsenal , and sank vast financial resources into what it has done , so unless the eu has been doing the world 's greatest secret project , the means to stop a given city in europe from being nuked does n't yet exist . 
  https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb538-cold-war-nuclear-target-list-declassified-first-ever/ that does n't match up with this list of declassified us nuclear targets from 1959 . 
  in a nuclear world war iii , east germany , poland , russia , everything of military importance was a target .

  i do n't believe that juncker ever said anything about not establishing a free trade agreement without freedom of movement . 
    germany does n't control the ecb . 
    you do not have to control it to wield a large amount of soft power .
