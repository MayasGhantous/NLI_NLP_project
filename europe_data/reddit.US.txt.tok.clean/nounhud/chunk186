  * the uk was seeing an almost across-the-board growth , even in non-urban areas . 
  * eastern germany mostly is falling in population . 
  i knew that a post-iron curtain difference remained even after all this time , but i was surprised to see how much . 
  i wonder what that might portend for convergence with countries in eastern europe . 
  * the movement [ tends to be ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_\\ ( nominal \\ ) _ per_capita ) from poorer areas to wealthier . 
  on the other hand , spain is shrinking almost everywhere , yet does n't have as much of a wealth difference with the wealthiest bits of europe as do some of the bits that are n't shrinking as much in eastern europe . 
  * iceland , to my surprise , is growing . 
  she does n't seem like a major destination for immigration , nor is she the home of vast cities , nor is she tremendously wealthy compared to her closest neighbors . 
  i ca n't get into east asian baking ... i think that if you do n't grow up with rice flour , the sensation is just ... off . 
   the national average is around 5 meals a week . 
  we apparently [ crossed the threshold last year ] ( http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2015/04/15/americans-spend-more-on-dining-out-than-groceries-for-first-time-ever/ ) to where the majority of our food spending is on restaurants rather than groceries . 
  specialization of labor and all that , i suppose . 
  be kinda curious to see the ratio around the world . 
   american here , charleston chews are delicious . 
  i think that we 're gon na have to just differ on that point . 
   there is no doubt that the beetle bore a striking resemblance to the earlier tatra . 
  [ 1 ] tatra launched a lawsuit , but this was stopped when germany invaded czechoslovakia . 
  well , this explains the last century . 
   that is always a given with infrastructure projects i mean , you can build toll roads or have fees to amortize the cost of electrical lines . 
   critics also suggest the deal does not adequately protect workers ' rights , citing canada 's delay in ratifying the eight fundamental conventions of the international labour organization ( ilo ) . 
  this seems more like trying to use ceta to leverage in other left-wing issues than specifically an issue with ceta . 
  i mean , germany has 82m people . 
  that 's not that bad on a per-capita basis -- about $ 5 . 
  i 'm actually quite surprised that it 's that inexpensive for the year if they 're having to construct housing . 
    the rest of the internet https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_internet_restriction_bill  russian internet restriction bill ( federal law of russian federation no . 
  139-fz of 2012-07-28 ) [ 1 ] is a law passed by the russian state duma in 2012 which replaced procedure of shutting down telecom operators by prosecutors ' orders with a blacklist of internet sites containing alleged child pornography , drug-related material , extremist material , and other content illegal in russia . 
  this blacklist was supposed to be implemented and supervised by a self-regulating ngo of internet users , but it was never created and this duty was assumed by government agency roskomnadzor . 
  the bill also introduced several other changes in the law , including liability for providers of telecom services for failing to protect children . 
  some critics expressed concern that the bill could be used to censor the internet . 
  [ 2 ] not a block , but it * could * selectively block material . 
    adult mags https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_pornography_and_erotica  in 1996 section 242 [ 2 ] of the criminal code of russia became a federal legislation that prohibited sale and production of `` illegal '' pornographic materials . 
  [ 3 ] the section provides for a penalty of up to 2 years in prison . 
  authorities missed a critical definition -- the one of actual pornography . 
  while pornography is officially illegal to sell in russia , the law does n't spell out in exact terms the subject of the ban . 
  russian erotica is sold openly in sex shops and dvd stores . 
  newspapers publish information about police raids on such places on a monthly basis . 
    contraception https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_in_russia#proposed_ban  proposed ban   in 2015 several russian mps has drafted a bill which introduces administrative fines for performing abortions outside state clinics . 
  the proposed fines are 150,000-200 ,000 rubles ( $ 3,000 - $ 4,000 ) for private individuals , 500,000-800 ,000 rubles ( $ 10,000 - $ 16,000 ) for individual entrepreneurs and officials and 500,000-2 .5 million rubles ( $ 10,000 - $ 50,000 ) for legal entities , which can also face the full suspension of their activities for up to 90 days . 
  the cost for an abortion would also be brought up to the level of private clinics . 
  [ 28 ] another requirement which is yet to be approved is that women will have to go through a mandatory ultrasound , because 80 % of women will not abort something they see on a screen . 
  and a form signed by the woman going through the abortion , and at least two family members , if there are no family members the form will not have to be signed . 
  doctors are now allowed to refuse an abortion unless it is medically necessary . 
    patriarch kirill ( cyril ) stated that 80 % of abortions in russia are only performed by convenience . 
  the new laws could also cut abortion by half . 
  the russian orthodox church opposes abortion . 
  [ 29 ] while the russian official figure states that the restrictions will increase births by about half a million , pro-life activists say that the real number of extra births will be four million per year . 
  [ 30 ]   another amendment proposes that the state health insurance fund can be used to pay for an abortion only on condition of medical prescription or `` social recommendations , '' such as cases when the pregnant woman was raped , or when the baby has been diagnosed with a defect , such as a mutation or down syndrome and others which are determinable before birth , another example is if the woman is below the age of 16 , or has a low income and unable to support a child is the abortion eligible for state funding . 
  [ 31 ]   there was also a related proposal banning the sales of emergency contraception . 
  / me goes looking for one for the med . 
  [ ocean current flows around the mediterranean sea and atlantic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hjmjoowwgu ), 
  i suspect that the process is similar , though perhaps the terminology differs . 
  in the us , you get a license plate from the state department of motor vehicles . 
  there is a color-coded sticker on your license plate that is good for a year . 
  when you renew your registration , you pay a fee and potentially show proof of conformance with current regulations -- that your car is still passing emissions tests , for example . 
  my understanding is that in the case of the affected vw diesels , the dmv wo n't be issuing new stickers . 
  thus , driving the vehicle on the road would have an outdated sticker on the plate , and your car would eventually be stopped . 
  it would still be legal , as far as i know , to drive the cars off public roads , like on racetracks or farms , but there 's a very limited demand for that . 
  i 'd assumed that eu member states would do something similar in requiring the update to be done , without which they would not permit renewal . 
  shrines as a commercial operation long predates islam . 
  latvia and lithuania are interesting . 
  wo n't they refuse to update your registration or something like that at some point if you do n't ? 
  i wonder what the success rate on challenges like this is ? 
  ca n't be high . 
  can go up . 
  i believe that the issue is that people feel that the position may be a sinecure , a * quid pro quo * for some sort of favor barroso extended using his position . 
  no doubt , but if the financial industry is moving out of london as a whole as a result of industry-wide pressures , it 's not one company or two . 
  there is n't a competitor or demand for a competitor to jump to . 
  if you 'd a banker , you 're going to just not have fantastic demand for you in london . 
  unless you want to switch professions , you 're probably moving . 
  all right , but my understanding is that even if the uk retains passporting , the uk would still be subject to financial rules that it would now have no input on . 
  i still do n't see how even if clinton or whoever goes to bat for those banks being able to operate out of london , how they realistically get any benefit in keeping light regulation . 
  you sure ? 
  this is a sterile system , right ? 
  i mean , algae does n't grow in your sealed beer . 
  i think that stories like this are really only relevant to the local area where they occurred , if that . 
  brevik or the nice truck attacks were mass killings . 
  but for things like this ... many incidents like this will occur regularly around europe and probably always have . 
  a story about a statistical increase in crime after brexit or correlated with migrant movement might be of broader interest . 
  it 's not ideal for the bank , and i 'm sure that he 'd like not to happen . 
  but to claim that it 's a major us interest that he not have to move his offices ? 
  he 's no impartial observer . 
  how about just authorizing construction of more apartments so that there 's space for everyone ? 
   having once said he would relocate as many as 4,000 employees to the continent if the u.k. voted to quit the eu , jpmorgan chase & co. . ceo jamie dimon said this week he remains `` significantly concerned '' by the decision to do so . 
    `` this is very important for the u.s. as they have a lot at stake here , '' mcfarlane said . 
  i do n't see why . 
  moving a factory , as nissan or whoever might have to do , may be expensive . 
  but moving to new banking offices ? 
  i mean , i 'm sure that it 's annoying for the bankers who are having to move . 
  but it there should n't be fundamental limitations on moving . 
  but i do n't see how much the us could do , anyway , even if it * were * important . 
  at the end of the day , the uk maintaining a viable finance industry in the eu seems predicated on them keeping a place at the table . 
  if france or whoever wants to strip them of it after they 've given up their political influence , there are just too many routes to do so . 
  and when that happens , the bankers doing finance in the eu will have to leave london anyway . 
  honestly , why should europeans or germans feel ashamed about it ? 
  some guy working as a web designer in munich has nothing to do with the people associated with the emissions scandal . 
  i though that in the eu they are n't scrapping them , that it is legal to keep driving them as long as you put some tube on . 
  what car manufacturers were cheating in the us , much less `` worse than vw '' ? 
   sorry , yank , i do n't speak trump . 
  all caps , use `` great '' a lot . 
  hmm .
