  this week , however , both agreed that the eu 's back-taxes claim against apple was inappropriate . 
    house speaker paul ryan called the eu decision `` awful '' and said it `` should be a spur to action '' in the u.s. `` what 's inappropriate is for , in the name of state aid , europe to be rewriting tax law retroactively , reaching into a tax base that properly should be a u.s. tax base , because it 's u.s. income , '' u.s. treasury secretary jacob j. lew said during an interview wednesday with national public radio .

  i do n't understand the issue with the scale . 
  what mechanism is being proposed that would only manifest itself with more people ? 
  nope , because then lots of countries start peeling off chunks of others , like chechnya or russia with ethnic bits of the balkans , and countries buying off strategically-critical bits of other countries . 
  russia would never accept that policy for herself , nor is it realistic as a universal proposal for the world . 
  and russia knows that , which is why russia never proposed that for international law . 
  russia is trying a `` piss off someone larger and hope that they get bored responding and keep advocating for that boredom '' approach . 
  the us and the eu , in accepting a sanctions-based response to crimea , accepted that this was going to take a while . 
  further , the eu wants to , at least in the near term , use soft power rather than hard power in the world , and so it 's important to establishing that soft power to come out on top . 
  i think that leaving donbas and crimea would be a good first step toward that improvement in relations . 
  well ... realistically , while i recall that they were also near or below minimum visibility , they could have still made it off with a clear runway ... and just a but more visibility would n't have helped . 
  it 's true that the real fixes were to communication procedure , but i think that there 's also a real issue of misincentives . 
  that captain did n't have a history of taking off taking care to ensure that he had clearance . 
  but he was right on the edge of a looming fine for just exceeding his maximum time . 
  and so he acted differently than he would have , trying to shave off seconds where possible . 
  realistically , that does n't make sense . 
  maximum working time to be safe is an arbitrary line -- it 's a statistical game to try to find the right point . 
  there are other factors than working time in fatigue , like amount of sleep and sleep quality and stress . 
  but because the penalties skyrocketed suddenly , going from ` perfectly acceptable ' to ` terrible ' , the pilot was desperate to get off the ground . 
  but there was no great jump in his lack of ability to fly , and a less-stressed but slightly-fatigued pilot getting in five minutes overtime would have been a better choice . 
  mis-incentives created the stress where none needed to exist .

  technically [ white chocolate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_chocolate ) is n't chocolate , but its own substance :  regulations govern what may be marketed as `` white chocolate '' : in the united states , since 2004 , white chocolate must be ( by weight ) at least 20 % cocoa butter , 14 % total milk solids , and 3.5 % milk fat , and no more than 55 % sugar or other sweeteners . 
  [ 6 ] before this date , american firms required temporary marketing permits to sell white chocolate . 
  the european union has adopted the same standards , except that there is no limit on sugar or sweeteners . 
  [ 7 ] however , if it meets the us standard for being sold as `` white chocolate '' , it will also meet the weaker eu requirements , so it should be legal .

  i 'm thinking that maybe there should be incremental penalties instead of a sharp jump or something like that , and that the penalties should also apply to whoever is responsible for managing the drivers .

  [ 257 ] following his removal from power , khrushchev fell into deep depression . 
  [ 258 ] he received few visitors , especially since khrushchev 's security guards kept track of all guests and reported their comings and goings .

  i 'm glad to see that all more-pressing matters in europe have been resolved . 
   moscow 's quest to gain control of churches and graves dating from czarist times and squeeze out believers who look to the constantinople patriarch is part of a broader push by the kremlin to assert itself as both the legitimate heir to and master of `` holy russia , '' and as a champion of traditional values against the decadent heresies , notably liberal democracy , promoted by the united states and what they frequently call `` gayropa . '' ehhhhh ... okay , i 'm not expert and i realize that the nytimes wants material relevant to their readers , but i only really saw criticism of europe for `` decadent heresies '' , not the us . 
  the russian criticism of the us that i 've seen floating around seems to focus on the cia or military or claim finance conspiracies , not to criticize us culture .

  more than a thousand migrants , including syrians , afghans , pakistanis and iraqis , arrived in greece last week , nearly double the number the previous week , according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees . 
  that is still far below the roughly 1,700 arriving in greece every day at the height of the crisis last year , but far more than the 50 arrivals a day in the relatively placid months after the deal was reached . 
  it 's a lot closer to the slow rate than the fast one .
