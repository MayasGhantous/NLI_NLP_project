  my guess is that such a law would be overturned as unconstitutional in scotus , for a few reasons . 
  * it 's dubious to me ( not a lawyer ) that the georgia ruling passes the `` least-restrictive '' requirement of [ strict scrutiny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strict_scrutiny ) , since one could , for example , require registration of masks with a license number visible on them . 
  * the kkk are not a religion , though they do have some connections to protestant christianity . 
  islam is . 
  the supreme court is normally very deferential to religious matters . 
  * the georgia ruling was based on the principle that the kkk hood was not essential to get across the political speech required . 
  however , the burkah * is * essential to the religion . 
  you can restrict contracts . 
  i think that it 'd already be legal in the us to restrict based on region . 
  but the us market is homogenous-enough ( wealth , language ) and people move from state to state enough that there 's limited benefit and significant cost . 
  that being said , i do n't have any real objection to the eu creating such a restriction . 
  best to understand that some poorer regions may not get affordable content , though . 
  this clearly would affect the uk . 
  you wait until mass media has homogenized that humor to some degree . 
  yes . 
  but it requires a varying amount of mental effort , and some are slower to read . 
   why europe failed to match america 's tech boom and sure enough , does n't answer the question that the title says it will . 
  the aei is not libertarian . 
  it is neoconservative . 
  it pissed off a lot of right-libertarians under bush . 
  iirc the imf issues loans on generous terms , not grants . 
  ukraine is , i imagine , a good target , since it 's probably producing a lot less than it could if it had capital available . 
   with the country 's healthy economy generating plenty of job opportunities , only the most dedicated young men and women will voluntarily join the armed forces -- and there have turned out to be too few such people . 
  this normally means that pay is not sufficient . 
  oh , look at the country with the understandable tax code !, 
   bragging is not cool . 
  yes it is !, 
   am i addicted to alcohol ? 
  because i 'm responsible for my actions . 
  are you ? 
  a small note ... unfortunately , the phrase is a bit confusing . 
  ( a ) to say `` i act responsibly '' or `` i am a responsible adult '' would mean that you act prudently and reasonably . 
  for example , acting responsibly with alcohol might mean not drinking and driving . 
  ( b ) to say `` i am responsible * for * x '' means that you must take the credit or blame for something . 
  it does not necessarily mean that you act prudently or sensibly at all -- someone who drunkenly drives into someone else might be responsible for their death . 
  i think that you intended the first use , but the use has the syntax that i 'd expect for the second . 
  unfortunately , the two uses are very similar . 
  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/responsible definition 1 here is the b example i gave , and definition 2 the a example . 
  well , / u/koleye is a mod on / r/polandball . 
  he probably has more influence on public views on international affairs than most ambassadors . 
  technically , however , it would be possible to do this and not spend more . 
  on the other hand , the eu potentially has the ability to solve the public good problem , since they can mandate spending . 
  also , in the us , the federal government kind of abused the federal power over military affairs to extend their control over a lot of things that really were supposed to be under state control . 
  it might be a good idea to better-define any eu grant of authority . 
  for example , the federal government wanted to build a highway system . 
  roads were clearly a power of the states . 
  however , the military was the responsibility of the federal government . 
  and the us constitution explicitly gave the [ power to tax to fund the military ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxing_and_spending_clause ) . 
  the federal government argued that they needed authority to build a military transport system capable of moving tanks from coast-to-coast to reduce the number of tanks required to defend each coast . 
  and thus was born the [ dwight d. eisenhower national system of interstate and defense highways ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interstate_highway_system ) . 
  of course , because the military was n't constantly using it to move tanks -- in fact , the military was almost never doing so -- the federal government generously permitted civilian use of the system . 
  and , thus , rhe us freeway system . 
  thereby kind-of-sort-of not violating separation of powers if you look at it sideways and squint a lot . 
  then the federal government wanted to set the minimum drinking age to 21 , [ one of the highest in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legal_drinking_age ) . 
  this was also clearly a state power , not a federal power . 
  however ... the federal government did have that `` defense interstate '' system , and had established that it could tax states to fund it . 
  originally , the federal government had to give states money in proportion of the population that a state had . 
  the [ sixteenth amendment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixteenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) eliminated that requirement . 
  this meant that congress could choose where it wanted to spend that money . 
  so the decision was made to raise the drinking age . 
  congress avoided * requiring * states to raise their drinking age . 
  however , if they did n't do so , they 'd still have to pay the same taxes ... [ but the federal government would withhold their highway spending , which was a lot of money ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_minimum_drinking_age_act ) . 
  while [ occasionally the supreme court has held that this sort of business is unconstitutional ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxing_and_spending_clause ) in the case of highway spending it was either never challenged or the federal government won ( i 'm not sure which ) , and was able to impose a punishment on the states for not doing what it wanted -- the [ power of the purse ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/power_of_the_purse ) . 
  a few states held out for a while and just took the hefty financial hit , but eventually all gave in . 
  hence , in the us , the federal government has set a high drinking age because it can run the military . 
  the creation of a military and the power to impose taxes for it can grant a surprising number of loopholes to the central government . 
  i suspect that it 's possible for the eu to create a set of powers with fewer loopholes than the us did , if it chooses to go down the military route . 
  after hitler , things were n't too great in germany fir a long time . 
   for all we know , you have 63 % of the people in france who answer it 's caused by human activity and 37 % of the people who answer they do n't know enough about science / the subject to answer the question / have an opinion about it ( which is n't a bad thing ) , whereas in the us you have 49 % of the people who answer it 's caused by human activity , 50 % who say they 're dead sure it 's not , and 1 % who do n't know . 
  the poll also covered that . 
  the two populations have a similar self-assessment on knowledge of the issue .

  my [ above slate star codex blog link ] ( http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/ ) actually directly covers the `` i never run into them '' phenomenon . 
  [ france has a higher percentage that agree with human-driven climate change ... but not * that * much higher .

  do you think rising temperatures are [ ... ] a result of human activities ? '', 
  note : the other answer option was `` a result of natural causes , '' but respondents were also allowed to indicate `` both '' ( or `` no opinion '' ) . 
  united states : 49 % france : 63 %, 
   higher governments interfering in lower government matters both directly and by restricting funding the [ power of the purse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/power_of_the_purse ) has legitimately been a source of major friction , i agree there . 
  well ... [ reputation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reputation ) is a useful mechanism . 
  it converts single-stage games into [ repeated games ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/repeated_game ) . 
  in the latter case , it 's possible to have a disincentive for behavior that hurts others -- if you were a terrible , corrupt mayor , you probably wo n't get to be prime minister . 
  it does n't make sense to have everyone spending all their time following the name changes that people take , and it 's a pain to try to get every reference to you to include your former name . 
  if you want to leverage reputation , you 're probably best off not changing your personal name/logo/trademark / what-have-you .
