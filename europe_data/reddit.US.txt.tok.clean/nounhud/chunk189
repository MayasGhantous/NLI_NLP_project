  rather , it 's a disagreement with the validity of the axioms ... but that 's not a problem with the logic itself . 
   for some reason she has kept her ex-husbands surname , even though she has remarried in politics , name recognition matters . 
  i 'd think that you would n't want to wipe out the brand you 've built . 
  iirc ursula von der leyen is supposed to be a likely candidate as merkel 's successor . 
  not sure that this is a good argument for petry -- even if she manages to successfully send the political debate in that direction and sell the point to the public , she 's putting herself in a bad position for tomorrow . 
  not an area of expertise for me , but i 'd imagine that some of that is because greece is in the euro . 
  if there 's a trade deficit with other ez members , instead of the drachma simply weakening , the way to reduce the income of greek workers is to either require them to take pay cuts , or , if that 's not viable , lay them off and re-hire at a lower wage ( perhaps at another company ) . 
  even without unions working to block wage cuts and layoffs , i 'd imagine that greece could be expected to have a higher unemployment anyway , simply because of its need to use layoffs to adjust wages . 
   here 's actually the most recent xkcd ( it 's an actual scientific graph with sources at the top right , it just has annotations on it ) .

  trump , and i assume sarkozy , is n't making a statement about science or even policy . 
  they 're signaling membership in a group , so that that group trusts 'em and knows to vote for them . 
  this all comes off as confusing and senseless if you take their statements literally , but if you treat it as a popularity game [ with people showing their gang colors ] ( http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/ ) , it makes sense . 
  trump does n't care about energy policy and even if elected would be unlikely to act on anything that he 's said during the campaign . 
  further , the right is n't the only group that has its bizarre little group identity energy policy statements -- plenty of `` green energy '' proposals make little-to-no sense , but by advocating for them , people can indicate that they 're `` one of the progressive crowd '' to people who identify as such .

  i 'd hope that you treated charles darwin better back when you and him were still around . 
   he cited the budapest government 's treatment of refugees , independence of the judiciary and freedom of the press . 
  not saying that hungary 's fantastic , but do n't they have a higher per-capita refugee asylum application rate than any other eu member ? 
  other members might have backlashes as well if their intake was as high .

   the question is , what should researchers do if they find life in the martian sample .

  this still seems like a counterproductive move for russia . 
  there is no way that not exporting salt to russia is going to significantly disrupt the economy of the us , eu , norway , canada , or australia . 
  on the other hand , it will muck with the price of an essential food in russia , which does have an economy under stress . 
  i also suspect that salt stores well and that it 's not hard to ramp production down or up . 
  if you feel that it 's so lucrative , why not open up your own business that pays slightly more and make a bonanza as well as making those people better off ? 
  my suspicion is that there 's less money there than you 're estimating ... 
  that 's asserting that the status quo allocation is the best of all worlds . 
   i would have a hard time imagining eisenhower , truman , churchill , de gaulle or jean monnet going to work for goldman sachs after their public offices , even if their qualifications were at least on par with barroso 's . 
  let 's find out !, 
  ( checks wikipedia ! ), 
  * eisenhower retired . 
  came from a poor family and worked his way up in the military , peak net worth about $ 8m in 2010 dollars . 
  did a bit of political campaigning for others in retirement . 
  * truman 's peak net wealth was under $ 1m in 2010 dollars . 
  he never graduated from college . 
  he was a [ haberdasher ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/haberdasher ) , mail clerk , timekeeper , soldier , us senator , salesman , and county commissioner . 
  he explicitly refused to work for a company after retiring from the presidency , as be felt that it would tarnish the office . 
  he had essentially no money at the time he left office and at the time , presidents did not receive a pension . 
  he made some money from writing and selling his memoirs . 
  he still would have been essentially penniless , but congress ( probably because of his financial situation ) voted to give past presidents a pension . 
  * churchill had debt problems for much of his life , living extravagantly and getting millions of dollars underwater . 
  the combination of a $ 5m in present-day terms inheritance from a relative and some millions made from using his post-pmship fame to sell books , paintings , give talks , and license film rights meant that he passed away with about $ 7m . 
  * de gaulle was a soldier . 
  he refused his presidential pension and drew only his soldier 's pension . 
  he wrote books after his political retirement . 
  * jean monnet did n't go to college . 
  he worked in his family business as a cognac merchant when young , and later moved into financing companies . 
  his later life was in various bureaucratic positions and finally , in retirement , writing his memoirs . 
  so it looks like that 's true -- none of them did . 
  thank you . 
  reddit and many other websites are us and do n't impose similar restrictions . 
  this is facebook , not the us . 
  in 2008 , it looks like independence movements held just under a quarter of the seats in sicily . 
  damn right !, 
  it was left an open question at the time . 
  hence , a war over the matter . 
  the eu avoided that by making it explicit that there was a right , which means that if that right goes away , it will also be explicit . 
  many people would say that there is a responsibility in society to ensure a certain amount of income equality . 
  and i 've no problem with an argument like that -- it 's as reasonable as any other value assertion . 
  but i want someone voting on it or reading about it to understand that what they are addressing is , in fact , income equality , and not someone failing to have the basic essentials . 
  i have no objection to people raising inequality as a social issue . 
  that 's fine -- that 's a legitimate value judgment about society . 
  but it should be done in such a way that they are doing so with and understand what the issues are . 
  it should not rely on public confusion on the point . 
  in the us , there was a while in the argument about evolution where people were leveraging the difference between `` theory '' in its scientific sense and its common use to exploit confusion and get through an impression that were acceptable to the people checking them ( ah , it says that evolution is a theory ... very good , it is a formulated explanation for observed phenomena indeed ... carry on ) while telling schoolchildren that it was '' * only * a theory '' , using the common sense of the term as something speculative or unlikely . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolution_as_fact_and_theory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selman_v._cobb_county_school_district that was on the right , this is on the left , but both are not okay with me . 
  that kind of nonsense is dishonest and should not happen . 
  people should not be in a position where they can swipe the authority of scientists by making them ` say ' something different to the public . 
  the data needs to be presented honestly and unambiguously . 
  and even aside from that objection , does it make sense even as some sort of social goal ? 
  let 's say that it was renamed to ` median income inequality ' or something like that . 
  i 'd be comfortable with that insofar as my above objection goes . 
  but the idea behind the eu is that there is a single bloc -- one labor market , with freedom of movement , yes ? 
  so why does it make sense to be using a measurement based upon the idea that the blocs are at country level , that embeds the concept that it is right and appropriate for germans to have a higher standard of living than poles ? 
  if i can say `` we should not send development aid to romania when we have a higher rate of median income inequality here in the netherlands ... we must tend to our own deserving first '' , surely this is a value judgment that would be a dubious one for the progressive humanist ? 
  the latter is a * the atlantic * article , if you prefer that -- when searching for it , the * telegraph * article came up first . 
  well , that was part of it , too . 
  i was thinking of the [ zimmerman telegram ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zimmermann_telegram ) . 
  the brits were spying on american diplomatic cables and were able to break german codes and thus obtain a copy of a damning german offer to support mexico in annexing part of the united states . 
  for the brits , this was pure gold -- they handed it off to the us with a cover story . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/realestate/soundproofing-for-new-york-noise.html?_r=0 there are things that can be done to mitigate it . 
  not sure to what extent and how common they are . 
  yeah , sandbags or something could make a difference , but if opening the doors makes a difference , it 's [ already your door seal that 's the barrier ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s76qn7bpcsq&amp;t=50 ) . 
  well ... the us was n't actively-fighting , but churchill had been doing everything he could to bring the us in by that point , and the us had substantially shifted her position away from neutrality and towards the allies at this point ; she was really bending or breaking neutrality restrictions at this point . 
  additionally , the us had been in opposition to japan to some time before pearl harbor . 
  * the us had [ agreed to send the allies substantial supplies at this point ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lend-lease ) : `` this program effectively ended the united states ' pretense of neutrality and was a decisive step away from non-interventionist policy , which had dominated united states foreign relations since 1931 . '', 
  * the us had [ cut off access to critical strategic supplies to japan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/events_leading_to_the_attack_on_pearl_harbor#background_to_conflict ) and [ froze all japanese assets that the us had access to ] ( http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/united-states-freezes-japanese-assets ) . 
  at that point , japan lost the ability to wage war for more than another eighteen months due to lack of oil unless it could break the us embargo and seize oil sources . 
  the us was n't expecting pearl harbor , but * was * expecting a likely japanese attack in the phillippines at that point .
