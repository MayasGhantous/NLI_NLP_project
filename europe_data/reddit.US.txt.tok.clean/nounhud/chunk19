  remember that : * some processes we 've optimized . 
  food preparation ( some of which is a function of how much food you 're preparing ) is much faster now , and public education/daycare covers some of the child-rearing effort . 
  that would actually represent a reduction in effort . 
  * people used to have a lot more children . 
  [ in the us ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4847a1.htm ) , `` family size declined between 1800 and 1900 from 7.0 to 3.5 children ... by 1933 [ the great depression , when financial pressures forced family sizes into a valley ] , the average family size had declined to 2.3 children . '', 
  if you have to spend n minutes per day on each kid , that 's going to add up . 
  * if you 're on a farm , it does n't take that long until kids can provide a useful return in the form of farm labor . 
  and you do n't have the expense of education ( or you did , but typical education was just primary , and you were going to wind up paying for that in taxes whether you had a kid or not anyway ) . 
  i 'd think that the cost would depend upon your specific needs , / u/turtlefucker472 . 
   or women are paid by the state to have babies and the state raises them while my own enumeration of the options is pretty much in line with yours ( though # 1 can not work alone in the long run ) , i 'm suspicious that # 4 ( or a variant , where babies are brought to term entirely outside a human body ) is the most long-term viable option . 
  most areas of labor have become specialized , and we 've enjoyed gains in efficiency there . 
  child-bearing and child-rearing largely have not ( other than in the shift to daycares and public schools ) . 
  note that this is not a trivial thing to change . 
  the family structure that we 've built up and the way children are raised is a huge chunk of society , and not something to change and get something working correctly in one go . 
  there have been various people who have tried experimenting with alternatives -- israeli [ * kibbutzim * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kibbutz ) would be one example -- communes , [ some of which performed communal raising of children ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kibbutz#children ) . 
  this effort failed -- it died out and was not seen as preferable to traditional families . 
  while i 'll bet that there 's some form of way of running this well , i suspect that it will take generations to get right . 
  [ * logan 's run * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logan%27s_run )  logan 's run is a novel by william f. nolan and george clayton johnson . 
  published in 1967 , it depicts a dystopic ageist future society in which both population and the consumption of resources are maintained in equilibrium by requiring the death of everyone reaching a particular age . 
  the story follows the actions of logan , a sandman charged with enforcing the rule , as he tracks down and kills citizens who `` run '' from society 's lethal demand -- only to end up `` running '' himself . 
   and is picking up rapidly because of the housing market detroit 's population has been continuously shrinking for 60 years and is still shrinking . 
  the rate of loss has decreased to < checks statistics  something like 500 people a month , though , not anywhere near as high as it was some time back , but detroit 's not what i think i would call `` picking up rapidly '' . 
  [ as of 2015 , it looks like a population of 713,777 ] ( https://suburbanstats.org/population/michigan/how-many-people-live-in-detroit ) . 
   i do n't think it represents america as a whole , since it was entirely centered on one industry , unlike america . 
  yeah , that 's true . 
  sure . 
  the us government did n't block it . 
  you can show that ( and in fact , political speech is just about the most-highly-protected form of free speech ) . 
  * i think that you mean `` black '' . 
  * low education is a more-interesting factor , and what the article was about . 
  * you 've already got market incentives in place for efficiently-pricing labor -- do n't hire a worker at an efficient price and your competitor down the street gets him for a lower price , putting you at a disadvantage . 
  i 'd slightly modify that -- the best outcome would be to explain convincingly why someone is wrong , which not * only * tends to discourage uptake of the views elsewhere but also causes the original advocates to tend to shift away from those views . 
  character attacks would n't be the best way to do that , since they probably are n't going to do much to convince the original holders of the views , and not everyone is going to be interested in the character attack . 
  another point : if part of someone 's argument is `` x , and the government does n't want you to know x because of y plausible reason '' , that tends to create problems . 
  now you 've got resentful people holding their views privately who feel that they have damned good justification for them . 
  further , because that discussion probably runs along private channels that are explicitly hidden from the government , the government has no way to respond to it . 
   with all respect [ heh ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/withduerespect?from=main.withallduerespect ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cousin_marriage  children of first-cousin marriages have a doubled risk of genetic disorders ( although scientists contend that this is relatively small at five percent , compared with a three percent risk for children whose parents are not genetically related to each other ) . 
  / u/savannajeff is n't from the us , afaik . 
  although he 's probably more well-versed on ttip , which australia is n't a member of , than anyone that i 've read material on from the us or europe , and i 'd probably trust him to be pretty reliable on that . 
  so , ya , i think that people can hold knowledgeable positions without coming from the country in question . 
  i do n't think that he and i would agree much on immigration policy -- iirc , he 's a lot more enthusiastic about non-skill-based immigration than i am -- but that 's a political position , not that he 's missing information due to not living in europe . 
  sure , you can legally deny the holocaust in the us . 
  i think that you 're going to have a pretty difficult time making a compelling argument for it not existing -- it 's [ pretty well documented ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holocaust ) -- but it 's the fact that it 's hard to make a compelling argument that determines which ideas survive in that environment , not who controls the government . 
  and assuming that , in general , people tend to favor true ideas and throw out ones they see as bogus ( which i think they do , no matter how exasperating it is when * people just do n't agree with me on my pet point * ) , that 's a pretty good mechanism . 
  in the soviet union , [ lysenkoism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lysenkoism ) happened not because no soviet biologists were able to call it out as wrong , but because the state involved itself in setting which ideas were ideologically-acceptable ; people adhering to one view were able to entrench themselves in government and silence their rivals . 
  i have yet to see a mechanism that i would trust that would prevent government from abusing that position . 
   `` muslims had the highest rates of disability , with 24 % of females and 21 % of males claiming a disability . '', 
  that surprises the hell out of me . 
  in the us , [ clinton-era welfare reforms ] ( http://apps.npr.org/unfit-for-work/ ) that limited time that someone could simply stay on unemployment meant that a lot of people simply started fraudulently claiming disability . 
  unemployment dropped and disability rose among groups who were n't doing well in the job market . 
  however , i 'd thought that the uk had a extensive welfare system , where it was possible ( if not particularly luxurious ) to simply live on welfare as long as one wanted , which i 'd have thought would have eliminated the incentive to engage in disability fraud . 
  in fact , the idea that having such a system would reduce disability fraud was a major element of that article . 
  are disabled people in the uk provided with a higher standard of living than non-disabled and merely unemployed ? 
  also :  according to this secret report leaked by wikileaks 69 % of working-age muslim women in the uk are economically inactive . 
  maybe so , but i bet that a lot of those people intend to be housewives , and i am not sold that that is inherently broken . 
  the uk as a whole has failed to produce a formula that results in maintaining population with two income earners being the norm . 
  might well be possible to do that , but if so , the right combination has n't yet been found . 
  i do n't think i agree . 
  i 'd say that canadian and us immigration policy is pretty similar . 
  [ canada vs. united states as immigration destinations ] ( http://immigrationtounitedstates.org/401-canada-vs-united-states-as-immigrant-destinations.html ) . 
  hmm . 
  not really a [ semantic dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semantic_dispute ) unless there 's a disagreement over the definition of a term . 
  if it were a semantic dispute , i 'd say `` okay , via your definition '' or `` via the dictionary definition '' to get past the semantic dispute , because honestly , definitions are n't usually interesting to argue about . 
  yup , i think so . 
  means that ideas have to duke it out in the [ marketplace of ideas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marketplace_of_ideas ) rather than whoever happens to control the government at the moment . 
  [ hell , bratislava 's building flying cars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yn2uyqj1jc ) . 
   and in pactice there is no real difference in the protection afforded to it in europe than in the us . 
  try flying a big nazi flag in germany or a hammer-and-sickle flag in poland . 
  both are illegal . 
  people fly the [ confederate battle flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flags_of_the_confederate_states_of_america#battle_flag ) all over the place in the us . 
  i kind of agree , but [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defamation#germany ) is n't the only one with defamation laws ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defamation#united_kingdom ... and while the uk has [ very recently been shifting to be more free speech friendly as regards defamation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defamation_act_2013 ) , it was historically a very friendly location for lawsuits , which led to a lot of people suing in uk courts via any loophole possible ( and the us [ passing a law not to recognize uk court jurisdiction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speech_act ) on the matter ) . 
  that was n't the * only * approach . 
  westboro had a ton of irate people show up to the funerals that westboro was picketing and sing together over westboro , perhaps most-unusually from motorcycle gangs like the [ patriot guard riders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriot_guard_riders ) :  the group was formed in 2005 [ 13 ] to shelter and protect the deceased 's family against protesters from the westboro baptist church , who claim that the deaths of american troops in iraq and afghanistan are divine retribution for american tolerance of homosexuality . 
  pgr members position themselves to physically shield the mourners from the presence of the westboro protesters by blocking the protesters from view with their motorcade , or by having members hold american flags . 
  the group also drowns out the protesters ' chants by singing patriotic songs or by revving motorcycle engines . 
  [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] ... as of march 2011 , pgr reported over 220,000 members . 
  as well as [ some other groups ] ( http://www.christianpost.com/news/biker-gang-offers-protective-wall-against-westboro-baptist-at-maya-angelous-funeral-120866/ )  a may 31 update on the `` 2 million bikers to dc '' facebook page said the bikers would protect angelou 's saturday funeral from westboro protesters `` because it is the right thing to do !, 
  protect her & her family from wbc ! '', 
    belinda bee , founder of biker group , added to the examiner in a recent interview that her group would protect angelou 's funeral because `` if we allow wbc to protest her funeral what will stop them from protesting one of our funerals ? '', 
    `` no , we do not agree with her beliefs , but we agree with her freedom to have & voice those beliefs . 
  that is what freedom is about !, 
  if we attempt to shut up all those who disagree with us are we not doing the same thing as them ? '', 
  or [ angel action ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romaine_patterson ) :  patterson 's best-known activist work was her response to the anti-gay protests by fred phelps of the westboro baptist church during the trials of russell henderson and aaron mckinney for the murder of matthew shepard . 
  patterson organized counter protests known as `` angel action '' , in which groups of people dress as angels with extremely large wings that shielded the families from phelps and his group . 
  second , in the us , the first amendment affects the government , not private companies -- i suspect that a cemetery can block the wbc from actually entering the cemetery proper . 
  third , westboro also might not be protected by the first amendment to the extent that they are n't just promoting a message to anyone who will listen , but are harassing people who do not want to listen to them . 
  there were some attempts in the past to go after them , and while [ * snyder v. phelps * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snyder_v._phelps ) was unsuccessful in blocking westboro , it was only because certain conditions were not met :  the court 's opinion also stated that the memorial service was not disturbed , saying , `` westboro stayed well away from the memorial service , snyder could see no more than the tops of the picketers ' signs , and there is no indication that the picketing interfered with the funeral service itself . 
  '' [ 30 ] the decision also declined to expand the `` captive audience doctrine '' , saying that snyder was not in a state where he was coerced to hear the negative speech .

  i do n't really follow bernie sanders , but if you 're referencing socialism and queues , i strongly suspect that he is simply mis-using the term `` socialist '' , and even `` social democrat '' would be a bit of a stretch ; he 's not talking about nationalization of industry and by european standards , he 'd still be right-of-center . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism  socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production ; [ 7 ] as well as the political ideologies , theories , and movements that aim at their establishment . 
  [ 8 ] social ownership may refer to forms of public , cooperative , or collective ownership ; to citizen ownership of equity ; or to any combination of these . 
  [ 9 ] although there are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them , [ 10 ] social ownership is the common element shared by its various forms . 
  [ 5 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] here 's [ his issues page ] ( https://berniesanders.com/issues/ ) . 
  his policies there do not propose a shift to social ownership . 
  they involve providing more benefits than is currently the case , but his shifts from existing us policy are just quantitative changes , not qualitative changes .
