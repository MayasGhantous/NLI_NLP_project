  * the us [ had taken over the british occupation of iceland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occupation_of_iceland ) and established anti-german naval patrols from there to free up british troops . 
  ( note : this involved a somewhat politically-awkward three-way dance -- the british had technically invaded , and the us was unwilling to occupy iceland without a formal request from iceland to do so . ), 
  pearl harbor was what ended us domestic political opposition to going to real war , though . 
  we did get dragged into world war i by them , though . 
  and before world war i , our army was smaller than portugal 's . 
  looking at the [ royal mile in edinburgh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poq_lzzcdj4 ) and [ times square in new york city ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezyrskgcyjw ) , i suspect that you 've got a pretty substantial margin between the two . 
  honestly , if floodwater is actually at your doors , you 're pretty much boned anyway . 
  house doors are n't watertight . 
  [ wikipedia : social desirability bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_desirability_bias )  social desirability bias is a social science research term that describes the tendency of survey respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favorably by others . 
  it can take the form of over-reporting `` good behavior '' or under-reporting `` bad '' , or undesirable behavior . 
  the tendency poses a serious problem with conducting research with self-reports , especially questionnaires . 
  [ snip ]  other topics that are sensitive to social desirability bias : [ snip ]  * bigotry and intolerance , often denied , even if it exists within the responder ( note that `` bigotry '' and `` intolerance '' have a negative connotation . 
  in listing them , i 'm not trying to make a normative statement here about `` the proper view '' , but quoting the article here ; the point is that these are social taboos ) . 
  [ snip ]  ** anonymity and confidentiality **   when the subjects ' details are not required , as in sample investigations and screenings , anonymous administration is preferably used as the person does not feel directly and personally involved in the answers he or she is going to give . 
    anonymous self-administration provides neutrality , detachment and reassurance . 
  an even better result is obtained by returning the questionnaires by mail or ballot boxes so as to further guarantee anonymity and the impossibility to identify the subjects who filled in the questionnaires . 
    a further method to assess the prevalence of socially sensitive issues is the so-called randomized response technique . 
  therein , for example , respondents secretly throw a coin and respond `` yes '' if it comes up heads , and are instructed to respond truthfully ( e.g. 
  drug abuse ) if it comes up tails . 
  this enables the researcher to estimate the actual prevalence of the given behavior without needing to know the true state of an individual respondent . 
    ** neutralized administration **   sdr tends to be reduced by wording questions in a neutral fashion . 
  another is to use forced-choice questions where the two options have been equated for their desirability . 
    one approach is to administer tests through a computer ( self-administration software ) . 
  [ 8 ] a computer , even compared to the most competent interviewer , provides a higher sense of neutrality as it does not appear judgmental . 
  okay , but let 's say that you wanted to block those via making them illegal . 
  that does n't mean that there is n't a better set of criteria than those chosen . 
  i 'm a bit out-of-my depth here , but ... i do n't know what various eu member countries have in their legal codes ( though i suspect that they have equivalents ) , but i believe that the us has the concept of [ contributory infringement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secondary_liability#contributory_liability ) in civil law and apparently [ aiding and abetting in criminal law ] ( http://www.techpolicydaily.com/technology/megaupload-lessig/ ) . 
  that seems like it could reasonably cover the cases here . 
  that does n't mean that there are n't issues -- it may be difficult to prove intent -- but it also avoids the issue of over-broad restrictions causing issues for hyperlinking . 
  edit : hmm . 
  apparently that was already tried eu-wide with [ ipred2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_directive_on_criminal_measures_aimed_at_ensuring_the_enforcement_of_intellectual_property_rights ) . 
  some did , but while i do n't entirely understand the whole uk class definition business , it seems that being working-class was correlated with voting leave : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/eu-referendum-how-the-results-compare-to-the-uks-educated-old-an/  levels of education and class overlap strongly in the uk , and so the brexit vote also matched up with areas with higher levels of people from the de social class - meaning people in semi-skilled or unskilled labour , those in casual labour and pensioners . 
    this includes blaenau gwent in wales , which has the highest working class population in britain . 
  some 62 percent of voters here went for leave . 
    just three of the top fifty areas with the highest share of people from de class backgrounds voted to remain . 
    leicester , liverpool and newham in london were statistical anomalies because they are big cities with a high number of young voters . 
  not as much as age , though ... i remember seeing scattercharts on here of the results , and age was strongly-correlated with leave support , followed by education . 
  income was less-strongly-correlated . 
  edit : ah , [ this is what i was thinking of ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/06/brexit-vote-statistics-united-kingdom-european-union/488780/ ) . 
  looks like it was education that was the strongest , then income , then age . 
  they did n't seem to print the r-value on each chart , but you can eyeball it . 
  i went back and read one of the early papers advocating for use of the term decades back . 
  it was arguing for something that had higher visibility ( since poverty in its sense at the time had been more-or-less eliminated in the wealthy country ) . 
  no , there 's no good reason to use a term that confuses the public when there 's one that does n't suffer the problem in the form of `` inequality '' . 
  * your * colleagues are n't necessarily involved in advocacy . 
  but the people who advocated for use of the term were . 
  that 's what cheeses me off . 
  i do n't know if anyone 's ever tried measuring degree of belief in conspiracies , but i could very easily believe that the level has n't changed all that much . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_conspiracy_theories it used to be belief in jewish conspiracies or catholic conspiracies or masonic conspiracies . 
   relative poverty is important because it tells us that tax burden is not evenly shared throughout society the term should not be `` poverty '' , but `` inequality '' then . 
  that 's what ppp adjustment is for . 
  that 's not what median income is for . 
  hijacking the term `` poverty '' to mean `` inequality '' so that political advocates for wealth redistribution always have an available argument to make is stupid . 
  if someone wants to say `` inequality '' , they should say `` inequality '' and let their argument stand on its own merits . 
  they should be honest about the argument they 're making , avoiding the risk of misleading people examining the issue . 
  i see that the article has not indicated whether this is absolute poverty -- i.e. 
  being actually poor -- or `` relative poverty '' -- having income inequality . 
  / r/ukpolitics seems to have a lot of it . 
  you ever seen * lawrence of arabia * ? 
   '' [ so long as the arabs fight tribe against tribe , so long will they be a little people , a silly people , greedy , barbarous , and cruel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/v/kk_iuljnaki?start=229&amp;end=246&amp;autoplay=1 ) '' . 
  harsh words , and yet ... 
   only calling a jihad they would have a claim ... how would that give them a claim ? 
  i do n't really understand the `` anti-austerity '' arguments in their present form . 
  if , say , italy was saying `` hey , we want more fiscal transfers '' , that i could understand . 
  but i do n't understand the `` we want to run more drastic deficits '' desire . 
  it seems like a short-term fix . 
  is the real goal to run up a massive debt and then default to get a * de facto * transfer ? 
  you know , a brexit is going to hurt both of you two no matter what , but if the eu and the uk get into enough willy-waving matches ( `` i could * really hurt your economy * '' `` i could hurt yours ! '', 
  `` well , how about i do this !, 
  '' ) , you can probably manage to make it even more painful for both of yourselves . 
  also , the `` brexit must hurt the uk to help preserve the eu '' idea is stupid . 
  if you do n't want member states to leave even if they want to do so , there 's an easy way -- propose removing article 50 . 
  well , we can do the estonia-finland comparison . 
  finns did n't all wind up living homeless in the wilderness while the estonians enjoyed the concrete block housing . 
  that makes me guess that there probably would have been housing in the area , even sans communism . 
  might have looked quite a bit different , but ... 
  well , for some countries , it would n't be as big a deal . 
  however , the uk , as with other wealthy , first-world countries , is a service-based economy , and a lot of what it provides to the eu is services . 
  and those are n't necessarily ( and apparently , probably wo n't be ) covered by a free trade agreement . 
   that makes sense and is socialist . 
  [ no it is n't . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism )  socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production ; [ 10 ] as well as the political ideologies , theories , and movements that aim at their establishment . 
  [ 11 ] unless you 're talking about having the government own-and-run industry , it 's probably not socialist . 
   that 's why joining the eu was horrible in retrospect . 
  well , did you want to not join the eu until after some arbitrary period of `` de-corruption '' ? 
  i mean , my personal suspicion is that having more money floating around makes it easier to deal with corruption . 
  eu accession * did * impose certain constraints . 
  and nobody has some sort of sure-fire `` de-corruption '' process . 
  and the article is about someone who left moldova -- not an eu member , and which had more-severe corruption problems . 
  turkey looks [ similar to portugal ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:portugal_export_treemap.png ) , so i assume that it 's got a similar manufacturing base . 
  [ you can snowmobile on sand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjigpi3akks ) . 
  that 's only to the extent that the federal government could n't be notified and brought into the loop and the state had to operate independently . 
  remember that this document dates to the late 1700s , and there was no telephone at the time , so communication delays were still a major limitation . 
  welp , i do n't see the text online , so i do n't know if he lists the person that he 's citing . 
  it does appear to be from a book written for the general public , so i imagine the writer would have emphasize the exciting bits ... all i can say is that what i 've read certainly was n't in line with that . 
  [ here 's a cia assessment ] ( https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/329511-19820402-quick-intelligence-assessment-on.html ) :  we also do not believe that the argentines would fare well in a full-scale naval engagement with the british , particularly in view of the nature of the forces the british are preparing to send to the falklands . 
  [ a later cia report on risk factors ] ( https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/329580-19820409-argentine-uk-situation-update.html ) :  [ redacted ] the threat posed by the argentine aircraft , especially the a-4 / skyhawk [ redacted ] . 
  the greatest threat [ redacted ] would be the employment of the a-4 's . 
  https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/329541-19820415-british-options-in-the-falklands.html lists three potential viable british plans : a blockade of the falklands , a naval surface battle directly with the argentine navy under cover of land-based aircraft from argentina , and an amphibious assault on the falklands directly ( the latter of which was actually done ) . 
  because you and pretty much everyone else signed the un convention on the law of the sea that says that you will aid people in distress at sea .
