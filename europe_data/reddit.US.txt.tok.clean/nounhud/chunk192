  i think that an independent press is important , for example , and a certain degree of education . 
  reliance on resource extraction seems to me be correlated with things being worse ( though [ canada seems to do well and does a lot of resource extraction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_canada ) ) . 
  but nobody has yet produced the grand step-by-step process . 
  i will say that i think that i would , personally , be willing to be in a federation with france or the us , and both of those have a presidential system , where the president has a lot of autonomy once elected , rather than a parliamentary system where a recall is available -- and you listed the lack of a recall as being a major issue . 
  additionally , [ wikipedia feels that corruption in poland has steadily declined ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_in_poland ) . 
  this [ report ] ( http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/poland ) from a random google says that poland has solid anticorruption laws in place , and the problem is more with lack of their consistent enforcement . 
   eu needs to admit , that the goal is a confederacy or a federation . 
  and with that comes a unified foreign policy . 
  confederations do n't necessarily have a unified foreign policy . 
  it 'd be possible to be a confederation with or without a single foreign policy . 
  federations almost-certainly do , though . 
  the saudis are n't going to war against you , dude . 
  hell , at the moment , they 're subsidizing the eu and whacking russia via low oil prices . 
   i think some people see an eu army as something that would only reduce their power , with no clear benefits . 
  in particular , france spent a lot of resources and effort to set up her military and would probably want some concessions from other members -- france is n't going to want it to simply be `` other countries get to control france 's military and treat it as granted from here on out '' , since the french military ( nuclear aircraft carrier , substantial military , nuclear arsenal , unsc permanent veto , etc ) is something valuable that france brings to the eu table . 
  that kind of [ knocks out a quarter of the world 's population ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/05/30/map-the-u-s-is-bound-by-treaties-to-defend-a-quarter-of-humanity/ ) . 
   if i was willing to trust my western neighbours and they were worth the trust ... out of curiosity , what would cause them to meet that criteria for you ? 
  hmm . 
  okay , let me ask a slightly-revised question , because i think that some people are worried about the prospect of being dragged into offensive wars in particular . 
  would you support the eu having the ability to order a draft in your country if it were restricted to responding to an attack on an eu member country ? 
  the us has signed treaties that require it to act as if an attack on an allied country are an attack on itself , so maybe you say `` well , i do n't want to be drafted to fight in x '' , but let 's eliminate that and say that this is explicitly-prohibited -- that only actual eu territory would be in question . 
  all eu members already need to approve accession of a new member , so territory can only be added to this pool via the member states approving it . 
  would you be willing to ( a ) let the eu supranational authority make a determination that eu territory was under attack and ( b ) make a determination that a draft in member states was necessary and initiate this ? 
  if you would not be willing to do this , is there a more-restricted form of the above that you * would * accept ? 
  like , a constraint that the attack must have been the first military action in a conflict , say ? 
  or would you insist that the netherlands always have the ability to veto a draft of dutch citizens for a military conflict in the eu ? 
  treaties are an input to law , but they are not the legal code . 
  if ireland extends taxes that are lower than that to companies , the eu might be able to say `` ireland needs to operate differently '' . 
  but to say `` okay , we need to go back and change irish tax policy retroactively '' means that companies ca n't trust the laws of countries in europe any more -- they 'd have to go and evaluate whether-or-not a given law might be viewed as invalid later . 
  and this was n't a situation where the eu said `` oh , shoot , we missed a loophole ... we 'll fix this next year and make it retroactive by just one year '' . 
  this is sitting on something for a decade . 
  that 's a major concern if you 're a company and you 're having to make a decision about what you can trust . 
  will this happen next year ? 
  will this happen to other companies ? 
  we are n't out capturing land for the us . 
  usually because there 's some issue that nobody else ( well , maybe the uk and a couple other countries ) are willing to step up and address . 
  i am not saying that the issue is disagreement . 
  i 'm saying that eu members have different policies . 
  country a and country b can disagree but still have some sort of mechanism to break the tie and come up with one policy . 
  they both act on that one policy at the end of the day . 
  but if they disagree and then proceed to both just go do their own thing , then they have multiple policies . 
  what i 'm saying is that the latter happened to a fair degree over the migrant crisis . 
  the big difference relative to what the eu does today -- because , sure , juncker can always say `` we should do x '' and member states might opt in -- is that federalization of national guard units in the us is not an optional matter . 
  if the federal government calls , the state national guards * have * to come . 
  if the eu were to establish such an institution and set up a similar relationship between it that the eu members , that means that , for example , if the eu says that the eu needs to occupy libya to stabilize it , or needs to secure crimea , eu members could not decline . 
  additionally , were the eu to mirror the us on this , eu members would not be able to independently choose to go to war -- the eu either approves or disallows it . 
  if the rest of the eu did not want france in mali , france could not send french forces to mali . 
  ditto for the uk and fighting argentina over the falklands . 
  my belief is that the above two constraints ( must be able to be called up to be under command , and can not operate on a foreign basis independently ) are necessary in the presence of a single foreign policy but inadvisable in the absence of a single foreign policy : war is , ultimately , the extreme end of foreign policy . 
  so , in my eyes , the question is more one of whether the eu wants to have a single foreign policy or not . 
  it 's even more complicated than that . 
  quick summary : there are [ ** federal forces ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_armed_forces ) . 
  the us air force , the us navy , the us army , the us marine corps , and the us coast guard are all federal . 
  these are funded and under direct control of the federal government . 
  they are generally ( with the exception of the us coast guard , which is both a law enforcement agency and a military force and can under certain cases obtain us navy assets ) not available to be used in a policing role domestically . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/posse_comitatus_act  the posse comitatus act is a united states federal law ( 18 u.s.c. 
  \u00a7 1385 , original at 20 stat . 
  152 ) signed on june 18 , 1878 by president rutherford b. hayes . 
  the purpose of the act -- in concert with the insurrection act of 1807 -- is to limit the powers of the federal government in using federal military personnel to enforce domestic policies within the united states . 
  the coast guard , despite the name , does n't just operate at home -- it moved in early on in the iraq war to secure ports , as i recall . 
  then there are the [ ** national guards ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_guard_of_the_united_states ) -- both army and air . 
  these are normally under state command , and as such , they can be used in a policing role while under that command . 
  however , they receive federal subsidy , and can be federalized by the federal government at need . 
  in that sense , they act as [ one of the multiple reserves for federal forces as well . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reserve_components_of_the_united_states_armed_forces ) these do not just stay at home either -- various national guards have been sent out on a regular basis . 
  you 'll find state national guards doing exercises and training with european countries , for example , or being deployed to afghanistan or iraq . 
  the [ naval militia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naval_militia ) serves a somewhat-similar role to the national guard -- state , unless federalized -- for naval forces . 
  few states still maintain a naval militia . 
  then there are the [ ** state defense forces ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_defense_force ) . 
  only half of the us states maintain these . 
  they are under exclusive state control , and may not be federalized ... but do not receive federal subsidy , either . 
  because the us is a federation , it has a single foreign policy , and states may not [ normally wage war without authorization of congress ] ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei ) :  no state shall , without the consent of congress , lay any duty of tonnage , keep troops , or ships of war in time of peace , enter into any agreement or compact with another state , or with a foreign power , or engage in war , unless actually invaded , or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay . 
  these normally operate for rescue or disaster response . 
  there are various ** paramilitary groups ** . 
  the [ us civil air patrol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_air_patrol ) is the usaf 's civilian auxiliary . 
  it has n't been involved in combat since world war ii , when it was bombing german submarines , and theoretically wo n't be involved in direct combat in the future . 
  same thing with the [ us coast guard auxiliary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_coast_guard_auxiliary ) . 
  there 's also the [ merchant marine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_merchant_marine ) for the us navy , which technically can operate armed vessels , though navy personnel are the ones to actually control the weapons . 
  finally , there is the ** reserve militia ** -- the male population eighteen and older , which may be drafted if need be . 
  that has n't happened since the vietnam war , though , and it would probably be quite unpopular for it to be called up again unless the us were attacked , as after pearl harbor , or if an ally were attacked . 
  the us does not have mandatory national service for all citizens , so these are not trained barring the event of an actual draft , and they ca n't be quickly deployed because of that training delay . 
   i highly doubt a majority of eu people would approve of being legally draftable by the eu superstate without a vote or a chance for their nation to object . 
  hmm . 
  would you , personally support such a thing ? 
  well , there 's some sort of threat to remove american visa-free access . 
  i think that your first sentence makes a very good point , which is unnecessarily hamstrung by the second sentence being a personal attack . 
  surely the proper term would n't be `` nazi '' ? 
  not under irish tax law . 
  that is , the issue was that the eu wanted ireland to change its tax policy . 
   the combined forces of the eu are not sufficient to successfully invade the uk ( though they could attempt to blockade it ) . 
  for more detail : [ we asked a military expert how to conquer the uk ] ( http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/we-asked-a-military-expert-if-all-the-worlds-armies-could-shut-down-the-uk ), 
  i realize that you 're joking , but : * i am pretty darn sure that the us is not going to stand and blithely watch * another * intra-european war kick off . 
  * wars are n't lucrative . 
  the bounding factor today on production is n't farmland . 
  congratulations , you 've captured land ... and the people , which is where the real capital today is , promptly leave . 
  unless you build fences to keep them in ... and then you 've got all the economic glory of the soviet union . 
  * also , `` you know what we should do ? 
  invade another nuclear power ! '', 
   eu foreign policy is to make external borders of member states secured . 
  well , for the past two years , i just watched member states argue violently about how that should be implemented , without having the eu move together in one direction .
