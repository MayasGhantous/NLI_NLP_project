  the us federal government can not say `` well , i do n't like this political party coming to power in this state , so i 'm going to start forcing actions on behalf of this state that are normally not federal powers '' . 
  similarly , the eu should not be forcing a50 invocation . 
   the governments of other countries do n't answer to the british people , nor are they responsible for ensuring the best outcomes for them . 
  my point is that any cost associated with uncertainly is already present in greater form in the uk . 
  and if the eu were to start saying `` well , x would be unprofitable for the eu , therefore the eu can start ignoring member and supranational authority separation , '' i think that that would be an unwarranted assertion of authority that would be very difficult to limit in the future . 
  it was intended to be a joke . 
  it appears to have missed with many readers ( particularly since / u/trolls _ brigade promptly responded with the same point , less-subtly ) . 
  the most-commonly-sold type of cheese in the us is processed , which often catches flak in europe as not being real cheese . 
  the joke was that russia was adopting us conventions in not using `` real cheese '' . 
  in the popular civilization strategic video game series , one way to win the game is to achieve a `` culture victory '' by having other civilizations adopt your cultural norms . 
  an ( amazingly large , to me , wildly out of line with its popularity among the general population in the us ) chunk of people on this subreddit apparently play that and other strategic video games and make and understand allusions to them , so i was trying to allude to that game element , where `` culture victory '' means `` adopting culture norms '' . 
   firstly because it spits in the face of democracy it 's a non-binding referendum that represents an internal process of the uk . 
  if the eu starts determining how member states should run their internal processes ( `` we 're going to upgrade this to be binding and further to be treated as if the member actually took action x at time y '' ) , that 's substantial overreach . 
  involvement in elections or in formal declarations should n't be something forced . 
  you or i would scream bloody murder if the us federal government decided `` well , people * really * wanted this , so we 're going to treat some state ballot choice as if it were the state actually taking action in a particular way '' . 
   secondly because it will only further enrage nationalists and populists uk nationalism is a matter for the uk , not for the eu . 
   and thirdly because an ambiguous state of affairs produces both political and economic uncertainty that affects the world , not just britain . 
  that 's saying is that there 's risk that the uk * might * leave ... so you 're advocating for doing it in a hostile and forced manner . 
  that 's like saying that there 's risk of a car crash , so you 'd best immediately drive your car into a wall at high speed . 
  businesses weigh risk all the time -- nothing new . 
  any implications of that risk -- like businesses considering setting up in the uk and hoping that the uk wo n't leave or that the uk will retain a form of single-market access sufficient for their needs -- will weigh more-heavily on the uk than the eu . 
  does n't need to be forced . 
  http://blogs.findlaw.com/blotter/2015/06/can-a-burglar-sue-the-homeowner-for-injuries.html  * premise liability *   according to premise liability rules , homeowners are sometimes liable for injuries suffered on their property . 
  the level of responsibility varies depending on the type of person injured . 
    * invitees *   invitees are people who the homeowner invites onto the property for a specific purpose . 
  for example , a gardener is an invitee because he 's invited onto the property by the owner to take care of the garden . 
    for invitees , homeowners have a duty to take reasonable steps to assure that the property is safe for the invitee . 
    * licensees *   licensees are people who with the consent of the homeowner enters property for their own purposes . 
  a social guest is a licensee . 
  for licensees , homeowners must exercise reasonable care to protect licensees from known dangers . 
    * trespassers *   trespassers , including burglars , are people who do not have permission or a lawful right to be on a homeowner 's property . 
  ** homeowners , generally , have no duty to protect trespassers from dangers . 
  so , a burglar can not sue for tripping on a toy car or being hit by a falling television . 
  ** you 'd probably have liability if you were engaged in [ mantrapping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mantrap_%28snare%29 ) :  a mantrap is a mechanical physical security devices for catching poachers and trespassers . 
  they have taken many forms , the most usual being like a large foothold trap , the steel springs being armed with teeth which met in the victim 's leg . 
  since 1827 , they have been illegal in england , except in houses between sunset and sunrise as a defence against burglars . 
  [ 1 ] [ snip ]  mantraps that use deadly force are illegal in the united states , and in notable tort law cases ** the trespasser has successfully sued the property owner for damages caused by the mantrap ** . 
  there is also the possibility that such traps could endanger emergency service personnel such as firefighters who must forcefully enter such buildings during emergencies . 
  edit : i should note that the above text was using `` can not sue '' a bit loosely . 
  you * can * sue for anything you want to ... it 's just that your suit may be thrown out . 
   but he was slapped down when mrs may 's spokeswoman said the remark was only mr davis 's personal opinion . 
  `` the minister for brexit needs to shut up with his personal opinions on brexit . '', 
  how so ? 
  taking away member powers is a real concern , because all members in the organization expect those to remain . 
  further , all members in the organization expect to be able to choose if and when to exit . 
  if the uk wound up not leaving -- let 's say that , for example , the public mood shifted after learning of the number of companies talking about leaving and the impact on employment and so forth -- that would be a major win for the eu . 
  i do n't see how that would cause harm down the road . 
  i do n't know anything about any of these train deals , but if someone other than the buyer stood to make more money from whoever bought the thing ( if it * was * purchased -- see / u/low _ discrepancy 's comment in response to you ) , then that other party should have offered more for the thing . 
  taking advantage of some sort of synergy that could exist does n't require acting illiberally . 
   vladimir putin just wants to be friends [ snip ]  you 're really telling me that if you have a choice between a woman , whom you think may have been trying to get rid of you , and a man , who seems to have this great sort of affection for you , almost bordering on the homoerotic , you 're not going to make a decision between those two ? 
  hmmm . 
  i do believe that the interviewer is a titch irked with mr. putin . 
  dangerous precedent to set . 
  good lord , dude . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate tfrs : * vietnam : 1.83 * belarus : 1.6 * ukraine : 1.5 * poland : 1.33 they 're in better shape than poland , but all of them are in decline too . 
  poland could draw in some bodies for a while , but it would also worsen their rate . 
  roads have been built through more rugged terrain , both mountains , like the andes , and through swamps , as in the american southeast . 
  the alaskan or russian wilderness is far more remote . 
  and the link would tie together entire continents . 
  that 's a pretty tough sell as an explanation -- no , we just could n't handle the last little bit . 
  oh , i 'd agree that it 's for other reasons of isolation as well , not simply people traveling from africa , but if countries in the americas wanted a road there , there 'd be one . 
  hell , we cut the same country in half from pacific to atlantic with the panama canal because we wanted cheaper shipping . 
  this is just a road . 
  not all languages in europe even have the view that the same colors exist . 
  where a language chooses to draw lines distinguishing between two colors is arbitrary , and some treat , for example , blue and green as the same color . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue%e2%80%93green_distinction_in_language for example :  the welsh word glas is usually translated as `` blue '' ; however , it can also refer , variously , to the color of the sea , of grass , or of silver . 
  the word gwyrdd ( a borrowing from latin viridis ) is the standard translation for `` green '' . 
  in traditional welsh ( and related languages ) , glas could refer to certain shades of green and grey as well as blue , and llwyd could refer to various shades of grey and brown ... 
  there are going to be a lot of conflicting opinions . 
  it 's probably actually labeled '' [ pasteurized process cheese food product ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/processed_cheese#united_states_2 ) '' or similar , not `` cheese '' . 
  edit : if it was kraft singles , apparently as per my above link , us regulators made them stop using that as well , so they 're down to `` pasteurized prepared cheese product '' . 
  you 'd still be having a chunk of territory not in a customs union get unrestricted access to goods to and from that customs union . 
  for a customs union to function , it has to be able to block that . 
  hmm . 
  it sounds like they do random checks ... i dunno if `` fully open '' is correct . 
  http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/close-sweden-norway-ties-despite-eu-border-dividing-them-1.2683072  `` because we have a long border , technical equipment such as scanners and cameras are important , but personnel resources are important too , '' said tony magnusson , director of swedish customs in western sweden . 
  `` not everyone or everything is checked but you can still sometimes have queues of a couple of hours at the border at peak times . '' [ snip ]  but an agreement with brussels in 1997 allowed existing arrangements in place that try to minimise cross-border disruption . 
  though the customs border has meant that checks can not be abolished entirely , the two countries have built on a border co-operation agreed in 1959 . 
  it has created a law-enforcement and customs check zone 15km on either side of the border , allowing police from both territories operate in the border regions . 
    some 10 customs check points operate at border crossings , operated by one or other customs ' services -- or often both . 
    while private vehicles are subject only to spot checks on borders , commercial traffic and heavy goods vehicles are obliged to use the major road border crossing points -- or four railway crossings . 
  they are likely to be checked regularly , though measures are in place to streamline the process . 
  there are highways all up and down the americas ... except for one 160km section , the [ dari\u00e9n gap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dari%c3%a9n_gap ) , that we have refrained from road construction through , thus keeping north america and south america split by road . 
  i imagine that there are probably political reasons for this . 
   migrants from africa have been known to cross the dari\u00e9n gap as a method of migrating to the united states . 
  this route may entail flying to ecuador ( taking advantage of that nation 's liberal visa policy ) , and attempting to cross the gap on foot . 
  you used to be able to just walk into an airport , hand the person at the counter cash , and hop on the plane , nothing else required . 
  that still would n't work . 
  ni still is n't ( post-future-brexit ) in the customs union . 
  ca n't have uncontrolled movement of goods in and out of a customs union . 
  i 'd assume that brussels would require the roi to institute a hard border -- the roi would n't like it , but that 's one of the requirements of being in a customs union . 
  maybe technology could speed up checks . 
   `` cooperation with australia looks as likely to yield success as the current model at this point in time , '' gloomily quipped ilya shumanov , a former director of kaliningrad 's transparency international office . 
  clearly the brits are onto something with that australian trade deal . 
   `` i am certainly a patriot , but i would go from time to time to poland , '' said vladimir kuzin , a former kaliningrad city official . 
  `` because what they call cheese in our stores is not cheese . '', 
  that sounds like imminent american culture victory to me !, 
  as i recall , that was someone 's interpretation of may 's probably intentionally ambiguous wording . 
  she said something like `` we 'll come up with a solution that includes everyone 's input '' . 
  if it had n't had the sunset provision , the ban probably would n't have passed .
