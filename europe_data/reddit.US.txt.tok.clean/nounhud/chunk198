  `` demand '' seems to have certain unwarranted connotations . 
  14,000 schoolteachers are terrorists ? 
  i do n't think that a bunch of illegal immigrants looking for work are hostile fighters . 
  well , the british need a way to disincentivize permitting illegal entry . 
  how about this proposal : continue to fine the truckers , but take the pool of fines and give it to all truck drivers that have n't had a problem . 
  that 's revenue-neutral as regards those drivers . 
  that retains the needed disincentive . 
  a further suggestion : impose a toll on the trucks equivalent to the cost of dealing with policing issues around the crossing to eliminate that externality . 
  well , if we accept that nobody has a spotless record , the real question would be of how the uk has done in relative terms . 
  i expect that they 're probably among the better of the countries out there . 
   if all these resources fail , the court must pronounce that judgment , which the law hath annexed to the crime , and which hath been constantly mentioned , together with the crime itself , in some or other of the former chapters . 
  of these some are capital , which extend to the life of the offender , and consist generally in being hanged by the neck till dead ; though in very atrocious crimes other circumstances of terror , pain , or disgrace are superadded : as , in treasons of all kinds , being drawn or dragged to the place of execution ; in high treason affecting the king 's person or government , embowelling alive , beheading , and quartering ; and in murder , a public dissection . 
  and , in case of any treason committed by a female , the judgment is to be burned alive . 
  but the humanity of the english nation has authorized , by a tacit consent , an almost general mitigation of such part of these judgments as savour of torture or cruelty : a sledge or hurdle being usually allowed to such traitors as are condemned to be drawn ; and there being very few instances ( and those accidental or by negligence ) of any person 's being embowelled or burned , till previously deprived of sensation by strangling . 
  some punishments consist in exile or banishment , by abjuration of the realm , or transportation to the american colonies : others in loss of liberty , by perpetual or temporary imprisonment . 
  some extend to confiscation , by forfeiture of lands , or moveables , or both , or of the profits of lands for life : others induce a disability , of holding offices or employments , being heirs , executors , and the like . 
  some , though rarely , occasion a mutilation or dismembering , by cutting off the hand or ears : others fix a lasting stigma on the offender , by slitting the nostrils , or branding in the hand or face . 
  some are merely pecuniary , by stated or discretionary fines : and lastly there are others , that consist principally in their ignominy , though most of them are mixed with some degree of corporal pain ; and these are inflicted chiefly for crimes , which arise from indigence , or which render even opulence disgraceful . 
  such as whipping , hard labour in the house of correction , the pillory , the stocks , and the ducking-stool . 
  [ snip ]  when sentence of death , the most terrible and highest judgment in the laws of england , is pronounced , the immediate inseparable consequence by the common law is attainder . 
  for when it is now clear beyond all dispute , that the criminal is no longer fit to live upon the earth , but is to be exterminated as a monster and a bane to human society , the law sets a note of infamy upon him , puts him out of it 's protection , and takes no farther care of him than barely to see him executed . 
  -- blackstone , * commentaries * i dunno if he was necessarily absolutely unaccepting of tough punishments . 
  [ watertown , ny , us average temperatures ] ( http://pics2.city-data.com/w1q/lhaq17595.png ) [ helsinki , finland average temperatures ] ( http://www.worldweatheronline.com/helsinki-weather-averages/southern-finland/fi.aspx ) watertown is actually colder in winter than helsinki -- not what i 'd expected . 
  i guess that helsinki probably is n't where everyone does their training , though . 
  edit : could n't find good temperature data with lows for northern bits of finland , but '' [ the winter temperatures can vary anywhere between 0 \u00b0 c and -40 \u00b0 c. ] ( http://www.kakslauttanen.fi/en/faq/what-is-the-weather-in-lapland-like/ ) '' . 
  that is , coincidentally , also -40 \u00b0 f -- pretty darn cold . 
   the margins in us elections are surprisingly close in terms of the popular vote , and polls that are few percentage points off in key states can turn it from a clinton landslide to a narrow trump win . 
  [ in fact , if you tally up the votes , some us presidents have lost the theoretical popular election -- but won in the electoral college , which is what matters . 
  ] ( http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/presidents-winning-without-popular-vote/ )  q : how many times was a president elected who did not win the popular vote ? 
    a : it has happened four times . 
    the 2000 election was the most recent when the candidate who received the greatest number of electoral votes , and thus won the presidency , did n't win the popular vote . 
  but this scenario has played out in our nation 's history before . 
    * [ in 1824 , john quincy adams was elected president despite not winning either the popular vote or the electoral vote . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election,_1824 ) andrew jackson was the winner in both categories . 
  jackson received 38,000 more popular votes than adams , and beat him in the electoral vote 99 to 84 . 
  despite his victories , jackson did n't reach the majority 131 votes needed in the electoral college to be declared president . 
  in fact , neither candidate did . 
  the decision went to the house of representatives , which voted adams into the white house . 
    * [ in 1876 , rutherford b. hayes won the election ( by a margin of one electoral vote ) , but he lost the popular vote by more than 250,000 ballots to samuel j. 
  tilden . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election,_1876 )   * [ in 1888 , benjamin harrison received 233 electoral votes to grover cleveland 's 168 , winning the presidency . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election,_1888 ) but harrison lost the popular vote by more than 90,000 votes . 
    * [ in 2000 , george w. bush was declared the winner of the general election and became the 43rd president , but he did n't win the popular vote either . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election,_2000 ) al gore holds that distinction , garnering about 540,000 more votes than bush . 
  however , bush won the electoral vote , 271 to 266 . 
  no -- i 'm not making a normative statement on how things * should be * . 
  it 's just relatively expansive . 
   all 50 states have to agree . 
  [ three quarters of the states ] ( https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution/ ) ( plus some other process , but it does n't require unanimous support among the states ) . 
   and if it turns out what we want is a shitshow then it 'll be us that absorbs the blame . 
  not her . 
  okay , but life is n't just a blame game . 
  she 's responsible for turning out something in the uk 's interests , however she does it . 
  throwing up your hands and saying smugly `` well , you asked for it '' as everything goes down in flames would not be doing her job . 
   i would n't be surprised if by the end of this the uk has some good but reduced access to the single market and has some more opt outs wrt free movement ( as they do now ) but ** loses their votes/vetoes on everything ** and continues to make payments into the eu . 
  the problem is that presumably would put the uk in an absolutely godawful spot in the long term , since they 'd have basically no defense against the system being abused by eu companies lobbying the eu for an advantage in the uk . 
  the public might not care , but the people who are responsible for producing decisions that will be sane for the uk 's economy in the future are presumably going to take a dim view of that . 
  i mean ... look . 
  as i understand it , one of the uk 's recent complaints was over a financial transaction tax . 
  this would be very disadvantageous to the uk . 
  the uk blocked that . 
  but if the uk has no veto and has to abide by decisions from the eu , i assume that there 's a good chance that a financial transaction tax would go through . 
   brexit : eu 's growing impatience over uk 's lack of clarity well , the eu is gon na have to get in line behind britons , who would probably also like to know what the hell is going on . 
  well , the us has constitutional guarantees , and those are above the rest of the body of law ... but they are n't unchangeable , either . 
  and all human rights are subject to interpretation . 
  the us declaration of independence is our first document that talks about human rights : `` we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . '', 
  and yet ... the whole world imprisons people . 
  the us executes people , albeit not frequently . 
  the whole world permits killing in self-defense . 
  there are clearly ways in which people 's pursuit of happiness is constrained . 
  clearly , there was no plan by the authors at the time to eliminate prisons and clearly was n't a solid consensus to eliminate slavery ( even if a few objected to it ) . 
  i doubt that anyone today would say `` oh , yeah , we decided that the declaration of independence was wrong '' . 
  and yet if i asked a child to read the text and explain what it would require , it seems likely that they 'd say that those words would prohibit those things . 
  someone 's right to life must be weighed against someone 's right to liberty , for example . 
  and depending upon how that weighing happens , great shifts in what is permissible in security might occur -- perhaps it is permissible to jail anyone if it seems like they might have an elevated chance of killing someone . 
  or perhaps the certain cost of imprisoning someone could be seen as so high as not being worth the merely-potential benefits of saving lives by imprisoning murderers . 
  an entertaining triplet of articles , for example : * [ britain 's rail networks are an expensive joke and the worst in europe ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/uk-versus-europe-commuting-rail-ticket-prices-strikes-2015-8?r=uk&amp;ir=t ) * [ british trains among best in europe ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/10528441/british-trains-among-best-in-europe.html ) * [ uk rail 8th in europe ] ( http://www.consultancy.uk/news/1958/uk-rail-system-8th-in-europe-service-quality-main-issue ), 
  if it 's economically-inefficient to provide service in rural areas , would it make sense for there to be either economic pressures to move to the city or use some system other than train lines to move people around in those areas ? 
  i mean , rail 's strengths are most-significant in high-density areas and its weaknesses most-significant in low-density areas . 
  hmm . 
  how about the [ charter of fundamental rights of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union ) ? 
  that being said , yeah , you 're right , it 'd probably be more appropriate to say `` europe '' here . 
   their purpose is making a profit , not delivering a public service . 
  the two are not mutually-exclusive ... 
   i know it 's a cliche to complain about the german train system , but years ago we hit a point where we were outperformed by every surrounding country . 
  as far as i can tell , complaining about how one 's train system is worse-than-the-norm is a popular activity in many european countries . 
  which countries would you say have a particularly desirable , good rail system ? 
  hookers can be chicks too . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union apparently the uk and poland have opt-outs . 
  huh . 
  hmm . 
  i 'm assuming that they have a sentence of less than life-in-prison-without-parole , and that 's where the objection comes from ? 
   the whole point of delineating human rights is that they 're supposed to represent some intrinsic ideal that a government can not take away . 
  the flip side of that is that if you want human rights to be a hard guarantee , you ca n't expand them to the point that they start to become controversial . 
  they ca n't be things that progressive party something-or-other manages to push through because they happened to be running things and got a slight majority -- you have to have support across society for making this something that ca n't change . 
  the eu decided to go with a comparatively-expansive definition of human rights . 
  whether-or-not that push was a good idea , it also means that people obviously place less weight on the definition . 
  [ wikipedia 's story of italy 's economy for the era covering those numbers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_italy ) :  ** fascist era **   italy emerged from world war i in a poor and weakened condition . 
  the national fascist party of benito mussolini came to power in 1922 , at the end of a period of social unrest . 
  during the first years of the new regime , the fascist pursued a laissez-faire economic policy : they initially reduced taxes , regulations and trade restrictions on the whole .
