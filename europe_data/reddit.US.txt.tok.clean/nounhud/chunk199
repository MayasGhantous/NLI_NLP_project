  [ 24 ] however , once mussolini acquired a firmer hold of power , laissez-faire and free trade were progressively abandoned in favour of government intervention and protectionism . 
  [ 25 ]   in 1929 , italy was hit hard by the great depression . 
  [ 26 ] trying to handle the crisis , the fascist government nationalized the holdings of large banks which had accrued significant industrial securities , establishing the istituto per la ricostruzione industriale . 
  [ 27 ] a number of mixed entities were formed , whose purpose it was to bring together representatives of the government and of the major businesses . 
  these representatives discussed economic policy and manipulated prices and wages so as to satisfy both the wishes of the government and the wishes of business . 
  [ 25 ]   this economic model based on a partnership between government and business was soon extended to the political sphere , in what came to be known as corporatism . 
  at the same time , the aggressive foreign policy of mussolini led to an increasing military expenditure . 
  after the invasion of ethiopia , italy intervened to support franco 's nationalists in the spanish civil war . 
  by 1939 , italy had the highest percentage of state-owned enterprises after the soviet union . 
  [ 25 ]   italy 's involvement in world war ii as a member of the axis powers required the establishment of a war economy . 
  the allied invasion of italy in 1943 eventually caused the italian political structure -- and the economy -- to rapidly collapse . 
  the allies , on the one hand , and the germans on the other , took over the administration of the areas of italy under their control . 
  by the end of the war , italian per capita income was at its lowest point since the beginning of the 20th century . 
  [ 28 ]   ** post-war economic miracle **   after the end of world war ii , italy was in rubble and occupied by foreign armies , a condition that worsened the chronic development gap towards the more advanced european economies . 
  however , the new geopolitical logic of the cold war made possible that the former enemy italy , a hinge-country between western europe and the mediterranean , and now a new , fragile democracy threatened by the nato occupation forces , the proximity of the iron curtain and the presence of a strong communist party , [ 30 ] was considered by the usa as an important ally for the free world , and received under the marshall plan us$ 1,204 million from 1947-51 . 
    the end of aid through the plan could have stopped the recovery but it coincided with a crucial point in the korean war whose demand for metal and manufactured products was a further stimulus of italian industrial production . 
  in addition , the creation in 1957 of the european common market , with italy as a founding member , provided more investment and eased exports . 
  [ 31 ]   these favorable developments , combined with the presence of a large labour force , laid the foundation for spectacular economic growth that lasted almost uninterrupted until the `` hot autumn 's '' massive strikes and social unrest of 1969 -- 70 , which then combined with the later 1973 oil crisis and put an abrupt end to the prolonged boom . 
  it has been calculated that the italian economy experienced an average rate of growth of gdp of 5.8 % per year between 1951 -- 63 , and 5 % per year between 1964 -- 73 . 
  [ 31 ] italian rates of growth were second only , but very close , to the german rates , in europe , and among the oeec countries only japan had been doing better . 
  [ 32 ]   ** from growth to stagnation **   the 1970s were a period of economic , political turmoil and social unrest in italy , known as years of lead . 
  unemployment rose sharply , especially among the young , and by 1977 there were one million unemployed people under age 24 . 
  inflation continued , aggravated by the increases in the price of oil in 1973 and 1979 . 
  the budget deficit became permanent and intractable , averaging about 10 percent of the gross domestic product ( gdp ) , higher than any other industrial country . 
  the lira fell steadily , from 560 lira to the u.s. dollar in 1973 to 1,400 lira in 1982 . 
  [ 33 ]   the economic recession went on into the mid-1980s until a set of reforms led to the independence of the bank of italy [ 34 ] and a big reduction of the indexation of wages [ 35 ] that strongly reduced inflation rates , from 20.6 % in 1980 to 4.7 % in 1987 . 
  [ 36 ] the new macroeconomic and political stability resulted in a second , export-led `` economic miracle '' , based on small and medium-sized enterprises , producing clothing , leather products , shoes , furniture , textiles , jewelry , and machine tools . 
  as a result of this rapid expansion , in 1987 italy overtook the british economy ( an event known as il sorpasso ) , becoming the sixth in the world . 
  [ 37 ] the milan stock exchange increased its market capitalization more than fivefold in the space of a few years . 
  [ 38 ]   however , the italian economy of the 1980s presented a problem : it was booming , thanks to increased productivity and surging exports , but unsustainable fiscal deficits drove the grow . 
  [ 37 ] in the 1990s , the new maastricht criteria boosted the urge to curb the public debt , already at 104 % of gdp in 1992 . 
  [ 39 ] the consequent restrictive economic policies worsened the impact of the global recession already underway . 
  after a brief recover at the end of the 1990s , high tax rates and red tape caused the country to stagnate between 2000 and 2008 . 
  [ 40 ] [ 41 ]   ** great recession **   italy was hit hard by the great recession and the subsequent european debt crisis . 
  the national economy shrunk by 6.76 % during the whole period , totalizing seven-quarters of recession . 
  [ 42 ] in november 2011 the italian bond yield was 6.74 percent for 10-year bonds , nearing a 7 percent level where italy is thought to lose access to financial markets . 
  [ 43 ] according to eurostat , in 2015 the italian government debt stood at 128 % of gdp , ranking as the second biggest debt ratio after greece ( with 175 % ) . 
  [ 44 ] however , the biggest chunk of italian public debt is owned by national subjects , [ 45 ] and relatively high levels of private savings and low levels of private indebtedness are seen as making it the safest among europe 's struggling economies . 
  [ 46 ] as a result of austerity measures , italy is targeting a public budget deficit of 2.8 % in 2015 , remaining inside the european union 's 3 percent ceiling . 
  well , it 's fine for doing a relative comparison among the countries listed . 
  less useful if you 're trying to compare a country not in the table to one there . 
  eh , just convert it into another checker booth .

  turkey does n't have an obligation to prevent refugees from making it into the eu . 
  the refugee convention says that the first safe country can not punish people from entering illegally , but there is not an obligation to block them from going elsewhere ( in fact , that would violate another element of the geneva convention , which prohibits countries from preventing people from leaving ) or to accept deported syrian/nigerian/eritrean / etc citizens . 
  it might arguably be a nice gesture , bit consider how hard countries in the eu are pushing to avoid the influx and consider that turkey has had to deal with a relatively larger collection of people with relatively-fewer resources . 
  that 's not to say `` the eu should take people in '' , but that i doubt that you 'd feel compelled to take in tons of people in turkey 's shoes either . 
  well , the nsa is bigger , and the nsa is , if you 're in europe , foreign . 
   the us is a country , the eu is n't , the us has interests and foreign policy the eu has 28 of them while i agree with you ... i have n't read up much on the political history of confederations . 
  there have probably been ways to unify certain areas of foreign policy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confederation#historical_confederations [ seven united provinces of the netherlands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_republic ) 1581 -- 1795  between 1590 and 1712 the dutch also possessed one of the strongest and fastest navies in the world , allowing for their varied conquests , including breaking the portuguese sphere of influence on the indian ocean and in the orient , as well as a lucrative slave trade from africa and the pacific . 
  i mean , they had to have some sort of mechanism to unify interests there .

  **   you must be a recognized refugee or person entitled to asylum and must have a residence title in germany . 
  in addition , you must be able to provide for your family 's livelihood and have adequate living space for them . 
  if you are below the age of 18 and have been afforded asylum or subsidiary protection in germany , you can have your parents join you without further requirements . 
    however , if your asylum procedure is still in process , or you have a suspension of deportation , or you have only been granted temporary residence , family reunification will not be permitted . 
    your children and spouse may join you under relaxed requirements if you file your application within three months following recognition of your status . 
  the application must be filed by your relatives in person at the german embassy or at the german consulate in your homeland . 
  to comply with the three-month deadline , however , it is sufficient if you write to the german missions abroad and inform them which relatives are to join you . 
  if the three-month deadline is kept , you can have your spouse and your minor children join you without having to prove that you can provide for their livelihood and that you have accommodations for them . 
    relatives from non-eu states can join you , particularly if they are a spouse and minor children . 
  more distant relatives can only join you in special hardship cases . 
  your children and your spouse can now file an application at the german embassy or at a german consulate in their homeland . 
  they must do so in person .

  **   only members of the family unit , that is , spouses , the sposes ' minor children and minor children for whom the parent living in germany holds custody ( usually sole custody ) , are eligible for family reunification . 
  this also applies to syrian refugees in germany , who can apply for members of their family unit to join them in germany as soon as they have been recognised as being entitled to asylum or as refugees ( and not merely as eligible for subsidiary protection ) by the federal office for migration and refugees . 
  in the case of unaccompanied minor refugees , their parents are the eligible family unit members . 
   you ca n't have a functional eu military without a eu superstate with one sovereign government . 
  i agree that you ca n't have a single eu military without a single state , but disagree that it 's because of the items you listed above . 
  nato solved those without a single state :  french soldiers can only take orders from the french government ? 
  there 's a military command hierarchy that exists that would take action in actual wars . 
  it just does n't have authority until member countries choose to let it operate as such . 
   the spanish do n't understand the germans when they try to speak english ? 
  nato standardized communication procedures . 
   romania uses the wrong type of ammunition ? 
  huh . '', 
  nato standardized ammunition . 
  no , i think that the big fundamental issue is that that if you have a single army ... it seems to me that it 's pretty difficult to not have a ** single foreign policy ** . 
  someone has to be able to say `` our goal is to do x , y , and z , and that 's why we should have a military capable of a , b , and c '' . 
  someone has to break ties and tell some people that they wo n't get what they want and others that they will . 
  nato wo n't ever do that , because it 's not what it 's for -- it 's a military alliance . 
  it does n't have civilian authority , and it does n't set the foreign policy of members . 
  it ca n't tell the uk `` the falklands are n't worth the resource expenditure '' or tell spain `` you have to pay for border defenses in romania '' . 
  nato can have closely-coordinated militaries that work together . 
  but it ca n't compel spending , so that members that are n't individually-worried about an issue for others fund it . 
  it ca n't decide on overall foreign policy objectives and get everyone heading in one direction . 
  right now , the us , germany , france , the uk , turkey , and portugal are all in nato . 
  and all of them have foreign policy that differ in some ways ( syria being a good example ) . 
  as a result , the militaries can pull together for a particular effort ( as long as the civilian governments want them to do so ) , but that does n't mean that the civilian governments want them to do so . 
  the militaries are not necessarily designed with a single set of cohesive goals in mind . 
  some members ( e.g. 
  the uk and france ) replicate a lot of effort from the other , because they ca n't be confident that the other 's resources will be available tomorrow . 
  a single state means a single foreign policy .
