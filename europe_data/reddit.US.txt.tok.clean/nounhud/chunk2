  that would include nearly any form of financial or legal agreement . 
  things like maintaining pension viability -- why would your generation simply not honor the pension system , since you did not personally arrange the deal ? 
  * it would break even direct , non-unanimous votes . 
  let 's say that you say `` okay , i will agree to defend an ally if there is a direct referendum and we agree ... but i will not consider any agreement made by by representative binding '' . 
  but you did not personally construct the voting system , yes ? 
  someone else chose , for you to live in a society in which maybe a majority vote or a two-thirds vote was to be binding . 
  by that standard , objecting to having someone construct a voting system for you , you could simply opt out by voting against . 
  even if you lived in a direct democracy and eliminated a representative from being involved , producing a collective decision that you 'd consider something that you should personally honor is not an option in nearly any case . 
  * the standard that you impose would seem to apply as easily to provinces of the netherlands as to estonia . 
  after all , you did not personally assemble the netherlands , just as you did not personally sign the nato agreement permitting estonia into nato . 
  / u/bosgeus did not , when the netherlands was placed together , say `` frieslanders are to be part of the netherlands , and i will fight to defend them '' . 
  would you apply the same standard to provinces of your own country , or would you consider yourself obligated to accept risk of harm on their behalf ? 
  such as ? 
  the us was under no obligation in either world war , and explicitly-avoided making such obligations in advance so that it would n't have such bonds . 
  that 's no longer the case . 
  the hypothetical being that russia invades estonia tomorrow and the us declares war on russia in response ? 
  i would not volunteer -- that seems to me to be a terribly unjust way of distributing the cost of war -- but i would vote in favor of a draft and participate in a draft and would accept being drafted if drafted . 
  that 's part of the price of living in a society where one makes treaties . 
  of course , it 's easy for me to make a statement one way or another without actually having a war in the offing . 
  maybe i have a poor ability to judge what i would do . 
  maybe propaganda efforts for or against would influence me somehow . 
  but that 'd be my best estimate of what i 'd do . 
   you are never going to have better freight rail than us . 
  never 's a long time . 
  you sure that there 's no way to substantially-improve on the present state of us freight rail ? 
  * what about , say , [ complete automation of the freight train , including automated unloading ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_q_oicxefs ) to other freight mechanisms ? 
  * what about trains with the mechanism to unlink cars from a train without stopping and divert them onto a side rail , tying them into another train traveling to a different destination ? 
  * what about automated construction and maintenance of the rail line ? 
  * what about standardizing modular cargo below the twenty/forty foot container level , like having 200cm cubes within those containers ? 
  * what about rating freight transit by peak acceleration that goods undergo ? 
  * what about rating by temperature extremes , and then binning into different costs based on this ? 
  * what about getting trains to a level of reliability and intercommunication sufficient that the current level of separation between trains used in train routing is unnecessary ? 
  * what about ( assuming this does n't happen already ) having freight train pricing only have outer time bounds , where high-priority shipments can bump lower-priority ones from scheduled track time ? 
  i 'd have expected more blurring given legal freedom of movement and labor . 
  language must still be a barrier to labor mobility . 
  i assume that this is going to be a huge political win for erdogan domestically if it goes through .

  honestly , it 's a little appalling that the renege numbers are even as high as they are in north america . 
  that being said , i do wonder whether joe sixpack in 2016 knows what a `` nato ally '' is or even what obligations nato has of its members , whether `` article 5 '' would mean anything . 
  this forum is probably something of a rarefied atmosphere . 
  it could be that if you 'd get different results if you instead rephrased it to `` our country has signed a treaty promising that it would respond to an attack on country x as if it were an attack on ourselves and will do whatever is required to restore security in the event of such an attack . 
  were such a thing to occur , and military conflict were needed to do this , would you want your country to take part in this conflict , or to renege on the treaty ? '', 
  well would you say that you 're barbaric , or perhaps that i am ? 
  because in terms of violence , i imagine that both of us would n't object to crushing a bug , though a jainist might . 
  a quaker might call the willingness to be a soldier in a war barbaric . 
  a european might call the death penalty in america barbaric . 
  the problem is that the term invariably-attaches a value judgment , and it 's imho typically relative to the speaker . 
  that does n't mean that all forms of culture are somehow equally-good -- just that i do n't think that it makes sense to pronounce a verdict on each thing while discussing it . 
  it 'd be like discussing british politics , and prefixing `` labour '' with `` dishonest '' and `` tory '' with `` greedy '' , say -- it 's just going to wind up producing a lot of arguments , when it 's as easy to make the same statement without the value judgment . 
   there are already trade agreements between the us and europe there 's no free trade agreement listed with wikipedia in the list of eu free trade agreements . 
   this gives a heavy hand to corporations in the us while giving them a free range of activity disregarding local , environmental , etc. 
  laws specifically what are your concerns here ? 
   and there 's no guarantee that these new agreements will lift previous restrictions , like the ` chicken tax . ', 
  that actually may be what 's currently at discussion , given that it 's talking about european auto imports for us agriculture -- i 'm hoping that it will kill that . 
   all in all , i am for agreements that help benefit our societies as a whole in the long term and not slip into absolutes where regional economies falter or environment is heavily damaged . 
  this activity might be beneficial for a few , but it will breed climate change for the environment ; or turmoil and anarchic activity that instigates other factors ( like mass migration ) . 
  well , if something lowers a barrier to trade , it should increase that trade , and that provides for economic efficiency , so i 'm enthusiastic about that . 
  i 've no reason to believe that it would induce mass migration or anarchic activity . 
  any change in trade conditions will create * some * form of disruption , if that 's what you mean by `` turmoil '' , as some businesses that were previously-viable will go out of business and some new businesses that were not previously-viable will spring up , but the alternative to that seems to be just permanently keeping a wall up . 
  [ social democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democracy ) \u2260 [ democratic socialism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_socialism ) . 
  well , to be fair , colonialism was also europe-centric , but i 'm pretty sure that that 's not what people are referring to when they talk about `` european values '' . 
  i guess the real question is whether we 're trying to get at what people mean when they say `` european values '' or what a reasonable definition should be , regardless of how the term is actually used today . 
  in any event , it seems to be a [ semantic dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semantic_dispute ) , and these are just not all that interesting . 
  there 's no profound truth that derives from a semantic dispute . 
  your definition might differ from mine , but that just means that we could give your definition one name and mine another . 
    and you dont want bigger economy in a free trade zone   why would n't we ? 
  our trade balance with the usa is very one-sided - we export twice as much as we import . 
  i 'd say that that lowering barriers to trade is typically mutually-advantageous . 
  it 's not zero-sum and advantageous to germany merely because germany happens to have a positive balance of trade with the us . 
  you can not maintain a persistent net trade imbalance -- were that to happen , in a country with a floating currency , you 'd wind up with your currency strengthening until your prices are so high that you are unable to make sales . 
  if the currencies were locked , as they would be if they were tied to gold or a common currency is used , as in the eurozone , then people would simply see raises in the net-exporting economy and wage cuts ( or companies going out of business/layoffs and being hired at a lower rate ) in the net-importing one . 
  eventually , the balance of trade evens out . 
  in the case of germany , germany tends to be a net exporter to the us . 
  however , that 's only because germany , in the long run , is in equal measure to its net exports to the us a net importer from other countries that are net importers from the us ; this maintains the balance of trade . 
  i link this [ milton friedman clip occasionally on this sub ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_fxt0em ) , as it has a nice , intuitive explanation of why persistent trade imbalances do n't happen . 
  i would say `` most '' rather than `` any '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agriculture_in_australia  australia is a major agricultural producer and exporter , with over 325,300 employed in agriculture , forestry and fishing as of february 2015 . 
  [ 1 ] agriculture and its closely related sectors earn $ 155 billion-a-year for a 12 % share of gdp . 
  that 's a substantial chunk . 
  i suspect that the limiting factor in agriculture in a developed country is land , not labor , so sparsely-populated countries that are also developed could fit into that bin . 
  i have yet to see a media source that uses all-capital-letters-words for emphasis in its headlines that has had worthwhile articles . 
   and then you know what happens when there 's no competition ? 
  were that process to happen , it seems to be as applicable within europe ( or within the us , or within china , or within any other country ) . 
   an average eu citizen will be fucked by any global trade deal the [ european union already has numerous free trade agreements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) with other parts of the world . 
  it notably does not yet have agreements with china or the us , two huge chunks of the world 's economy . 
  my * guess * -- without expertise in trade deals -- is that a free trade agreement with the us -- due to having a similar economy -- will tend to be lower impact on the eu than a free trade agreement with the developing world , and visa-versa . 
  would you advocate for restrictions on trade between us states ? 
  the kinder egg thing probably is because of a choking restriction . 
  i 've never heard of a blue cheese restriction , but if there is one , it certainly does not extend to all blue cheese -- i regularly eat both us - and europe-originating blue cheese . 
  also note that most of those particular small countries happen to have strong ties to the us and are probably more-interested in making their relationship with the us as smooth as possible than in anything going on in the middle east ; the fact that they are sovereign and have un seats provides them with a disproportionate political voice there that they can leverage . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_islands  politically , the marshall islands is a presidential republic in free association with the united states , with the us providing defense , subsidies , and access to u.s. based agencies such as the fcc and the usps . 
  with few natural resources , the islands ' wealth is based on a service economy , as well as some fishing and agriculture ; aid from the united states represents a large percentage of the islands ' gross domestic product . 
  the country uses the united states dollar as its currency . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micronesia  today , most of micronesia are independent states , except for guam and wake island , which are u.s. territories , and for the u.s. commonwealth of the northern mariana islands . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palau  politically , palau is a presidential republic in free association with the united states , which provides defense , funding , and access to social services . 
  i assume that he 's talking about the `` no benefits until having worked for n years '' thing for some countries in the eu , whereas the refugee convention does n't permit this .
