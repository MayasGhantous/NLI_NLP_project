  * what percentage of native swedes , adjusting for language knowledge ? 
  ( this one might be hard , since i bet that most have pretty solid knowledge of swedish . ), 
  not that that is necessarily an argument in favor of immigration of large numbers of refugees -- whether-or-not someone 's acquired a skillset , you still have to support them -- but they 're useful inputs in terms of under-performance relative to other groups , and they might indicate things like `` generation two will go through the swedish education system and have much better prospects . '', 
  ya -- the point is that `` government '' in us english does n't simply mean `` executive '' . 
  in the us , `` government '' means all of the state . 
  [ the judicial branch of the united states government is part of that government ] ( https://www.usa.gov/branches-of-government ) in us terminology . 
  i * think * that in parliamentary systems , it refers to the legislative and executive ( certainly the executive , but those two are n't separated in the way that they are in the us ) , which is why you hear phrases like `` formed a new government '' or `` the government has fallen . '', 
  i 'm sure that it 's hilarious to those of you who come from parliamentary systems , but when i first saw an announcement that `` x government has fallen '' somewhere in europe , i thought that a revolution had happened , since that 's what the phrase would mean in the us . 
  wikipedia [ puts it a bit more specifically ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government ) :  in the commonwealth of nations , the word government is also used more narrowly to refer to the collective group of people that exercises executive authority in a state . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] this usage is analogous to what is called an `` administration '' in american english . 
   if our legal system decided to put people in jail for everything it can , there wo n't be any place left in jails honestly , i see obsolete laws as being a not-very-well-solved problem . 
  there 's not a lot of political appeal in * removing * laws , so sometimes things just sit on the books for a long time until there 's some hullabaloo over them . 
  https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/top-craziest-laws-still-on-the-books  ... an old city ordinance in cleveland , ohio prohibits women from wearing patent leather shoes in public . 
  the reason ? 
  shiny footwear could afford a nearby gentleman an unintentional peep show . 
  or  if you 're a woman living in michigan , you might want to check with your husband before heading to the hair stylist . 
  according to state law , your hair belongs to your spouse and you 'll need his permission before you can alter it . 
  now , in practice , that 's just going to be ignored . 
  but it * is * technically a ordinance , and theoretically could be enforced . 
  and it adds to the ever-growing size and complexity of the legal code . 
  i have toyed with the idea of an `` anti-legislature '' , an organization whose job it is to identify old or no-longer-relevant laws and arrange to have them removed . 
  they could n't propose new laws -- only remove existing ones . 
   the person who insults a foreign head of state will be punished with imprisonment up to three years or with a monetary fine . 
  i bet that most of germany has cracked a joke about obama or putin or hollande or cameron or someone at some point . 
  i guess i know why we evolved boredom . 
  finicky as panda bears , humans are . 
  the idea of a `` purpose '' is just a way of analyzing how something functions , ya ? 
  if you think that something has a purpose , how do you derive that from something that did n't have a purpose ? 
  what 's the mechanism that lets something without purpose produce something with purpose , under your definition of `` purpose '' ? 
  i do n't see anyone advocating for that , unless you 're arguing for wildly age-mismatched couples . 
  the fact that aging female biology is a stronger constraint than aging male biology still means that men are constrained , unless you invent some sort of entirely-grown-in-a-vat reproduction process . 
  at least in the us , there [ is some age disparity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships ) , but it 's not huge -- the bulk of marriages have a husband and wife with ages within three years of each other . 
  women get biologically affected earlier and more heavily . 
  if you could find a way to reliably defer reproductive issues that women hit by , say , twenty years , everyone would be talking about men instead . 
  ` sides , takes two to tango . 
  it 's not as if you 're likely to see a ton of wildly age-mismatched couples , so men are about as constrained by women aging as are women . 
  if a man is n years old and has n't lined up children with a woman of about n years old as well ... < shrug , 
  our ancestors managed it . 
  probably felt the same way . 
   if at all possible if you want children it is good to start when 30 to give yourself some buffer room ( and provide for adequate spacing if you want 2 ) . 
  miscarriage and the like is a thing too . 
  `` propagate my genes , offspring . 
  i did my part , now you 're up to bat ! '', 
  if i understand correctly , the money in question would be viewed as part of estate planning , starting the inheritance process early because it 's advantageous for tax reasons , not an ordinary `` oh , here , happy birthday '' sort of affair . 
  was he considered to be an effective finance minister in slovakia ? 
  it 's actually been officially renamed from `` russia today '' to `` rt '' now -- `` russia '' is n't in its name any more . 
  macedonia , maybe ? 
  that being said , there * are * countries in the eu with territorial disputes , albeit nothing serious . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_territorial_disputes#europe gibraltar is probably the most-important . 
  sounds like risk of turning into a [ * the monkey 's paw * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_monkey%27s_paw ) - type scenario . 
  thanks !, 
   trade block bloc, 
  one outcome i 'm pretty sure of is that london does n't wind up dead . 
  this lacks the pleasant objectivity of the parent post . 
  pretty much the same as it looks now . 
  more self-driving cars , i guess . 
  yeah ... the mcdonald 's / coca-cola thing is laying the politics on a * bit * thick . 
  edit : no rainbow gay pride flags , though . 
  the us was a country before that , because it federalized . 
  i mean , if the eu federalized tomorrow , i 'm sure that it 'd promptly also get recognition as a country from every country in the world . 
   only eu can force usa to lift visas for the small countries . 
  the us will do visa waivers for any country when they pass the same criteria that other countries do . 
  edit : poland has been dropping : http://cis.org/vaughan/senators-vote-allow-visa-waivers-poland  the main reason poland is not able to participate in vwp is because of the continued high likelihood that polish visitors will not comply with their visas and will overstay . 
  vwp countries must have a visa refusal rate of less than 3 percent ( i.e. , the rate at which u.s. consular officers reject visa applications from citizens of that country } . 
  poland 's refusal rate was 6.4 percent in 2014 , 10.8 percent in 2013 , 9.3 percent in 2012 , 10.2 percent in 2011 , and 13.5 percent in 2009 . 
  if poland can drop by a delta of 7.1 % in five years , while i do n't know the statistics and factors driving it , it does n't seem absurd for it to make another 3.4 % . 
  bulgaria , on the other hand , is [ nowhere near getting in ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_waiver_program ) and has been steadily heading in the wrong direction , from 13.3 % in 2008 to 17.26 % in 2015 . 
   so he 's in their database now -- retinal patterns , dna , voice graph , fingerprints , footprints , palm prints , wrist prints , every fucking part of the body that had wrinkles on it , almost -- those bastards rolled in ink and made a print and digitized it into their computer . 
  -- * snow crash *, 
   until russia shows that they want to solve the war in ukraine and the situation regarding crimea . 
  i 'm not familiar with the protocol , but ... 
  in the event of putin deciding to leave , he 's presumably not going to jump on national television and say `` okay , we 're leaving '' . 
  it 'd be via diplomatic channels like these . 
  also , even in such an event , russia would try to get as much as it could out of it -- it would n't want to lose face , it may want to try and negotiate to see how much it can limit nato , etc. 
  that 's going to be a lot of people trying to cut deals and get as much as they can out of it and trying to feel the other side out . 
  no time to start patching those up like the present !, 
  the uk ( or the uk and france , for that matter , which are the most-militarily-capable countries in europe ) ca n't be expected to handle the bulk of europe 's security either . 
  i do n't have a problem with the us sending soldiers over so much as with european countries playing diplomatic hardball with the us with their own security as the stake ( `` the us wo n't * actually * be willing to accept europe getting into any sort of serious military trouble , so we can keep siphoning off our military capacity while we say that this is merely a short term or emergency measure '' ) . 
  it means that there 's political pressure on the nato members that * do * keep up their military capability to do the same ( `` hey , if * germany * can get away with ignoring her budget promises , why not us too !, 
  russia 's economy is n't too healthy right now . 
  keep in mind that if obama sends in the us military and keeps the conflict conventional the us would certainly come out on top . 
  but it would also result in a war , not the skirmishing from before , being fought through crimea and other parts of ukraine . 
  that 'd make it a lot harder for ukraine to achieve a `` functioning normal '' status which is what it needs for the eu . 
  it 'd kill a lot of people in all the countries involved . 
  you 'd have a generation of people maimed and maybe bombs and things to dig up . 
  sometimes that makes sense and sometimes it does n't . 
  the us and the uk went into korea in the [ korean war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_war ) and fought with russian pilots , along with china and north korea . 
   according to u.s. estimates , about one million south koreans were killed or went missing in the conflict , 85 % of them civilians . 
  according to figures published in the soviet union , around 1.13 million people , or 11.1 % of the total population , were killed in north korea ( with the total casualties of some 2.5 million ) . 
  more than 80 % of the industrial and public facilities and transportation infrastructure , three-quarters of all government buildings , and half of all housing was destroyed . 
  both south korea and north korea were bombed , but the damage was far greater in north korea . 
  many north koreans took to living in caves , or other shelter . 
  midway through the war , american pilots found that they had no more targets to bomb , every significant target had already been destroyed . 
  imagine chunks of ukraine looking like that . 
  that 's in a conventional war , a successful war where the us 's initial military goals were all met , the north korean attack on south korea turned back , and the conflict stayed contained to korea . 
  we 've got a strip of land covered with an incredible numbers of explosives slicing the country in half , and have had various conflicts ever since , from [ us brinkmanship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axe_murder_incident#operation_paul_bunyan ) in response to murders to north korean artillery attacks . 
  there have been periodic kidnaps and murders run by north korea , and a pretty screwed up situation in north korea today . 
  that might have been worth it , since all of south korea was at stake . 
  it was n't really possible to render the situation static and turn it into an economic fight . 
  but ask yourself whether the us going into ukraine armed for bear is worth the costs * for the ukranians * , because even if things go well , it may very much wind up looking like that .
