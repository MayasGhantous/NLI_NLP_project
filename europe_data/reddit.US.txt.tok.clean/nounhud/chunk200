  some people may not like the decisions that the state adopts , but whatever those wind up being , its resources are all heading in one direction . 
  it seems to me that the military should come from the desire to have a single foreign policy , a single state , rather than visa versa . 
  to say `` okay , it 's a good trade to have less control over how i 'd like to influence the world in exchange for a larger influence on that world '' or `` the cost of having to worry about having arbitrary members leaving under pressure is higher than the benefit of being able to leave myself '' . 
  also , excerpt on the pint :  the pint / \u02c8pa\u026ant / ( about this sound listen ( help \u00b7 info ) ) ( abbreviated as `` pt '' or `` p '' ) is a unit of volume or capacity in both the united states customary and british imperial measurement systems . 
  in both of those systems it is traditionally one-eighth of a gallon . 
  the british pint is about 20 % larger than the american pint since the two systems are not compatible . 
  almost all other countries have standardized on the metric system , so the size of what may be called a pint varies depending on local custom . 
    the imperial pint ( \u2248 568 ml ) is used in the united kingdom and ireland and to a limited extent in commonwealth nations . 
  in the united states , two pints are used : a liquid pint ( \u2248 473 ml ) and a less-common dry pint ( \u2248 551 ml ) . 
  each of these pints is one-eighth of its respective gallon but the gallons differ and the imperial pint is about 20 % larger than the us liquid pint . 
  this difference dates back to 1824 , when the british weights and measures act standardised various liquid measures throughout the british empire , while the united states continued to use the earlier english measures . 
  the imperial pint consists of 20 imperial fluid ounces and the us liquid pint is 16 us fluid ounces , making the imperial fluid ounce about 4 % smaller than the us fluid ounce . 
    all of the other former british colonies such as canada , australia , south africa and new zealand converted to the metric system in the 1960s and 1970s , so while the term `` pint '' may still be in common use in these countries , it may no longer refer to the british imperial pint once used throughout the british empire . 
  in the united kingdom , the imperial pint is still the primary unit for draught beer and cider , as it is for milk sold in returnable bottles . 
  in the uk , legislation mandates that draught beer and cider may be sold by the imperial pint in perpetuity , and in public houses can only be sold in a third of a pint , two-thirds of a pint or multiples of half a pint , which must be served in stamped measured glasses or from government-stamped meters . 
  [ 1 ] it must , of course , be the standard british imperial pint rather than the 17 % smaller american pint . 
  a pint of beer served in a tavern outside the united kingdom and the united states may be measured by other standards , and may be a british imperial pint , an american pint , a half-litre beer stein , or some other measure reflecting national and local laws and customs . 
  [ 2 ] [ snip ]  the pint is traditionally one-eighth of a gallon . 
  in the latin of the apothecaries ' system , octarius ( plural octarii ; symbol o ) reflected the `` eighth '' concept in its octa - syllable . 
  because of the variety of definitions of a gallon , there have been equally many versions of the pint . 
    america adopted the british wine gallon , defined in 1707 as 231 cubic inches exactly ( 3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 11 in ) as its basic liquid measure , from which the us wet pint is derived ; and the british corn gallon ( 1\u20448 of a standard `` winchester '' bushel of corn , or 268.8 cubic inches ) as its dry measure , from which the us dry pint is derived . 
    in 1824 the british parliament replaced all the various gallons with a new imperial gallon based on ten pounds of distilled water at 62 \u00b0 f ( 16.667 \u00b0 c ) ( 277.42 cubic inches ) , from which the current uk pint is derived . 
    the various canadian provinces continued to use the queen anne winchester wine gallon as a basis for their pint until 1873 , well after britain adopted the imperial system in 1824 . 
  this made the canadian pint compatible with the american pint , but after 1824 it was incompatible with the british pint . 
  the traditional french `` pinte '' used in lower canada ( quebec ) was twice the size of the traditional english `` pint '' used in upper canada ( ontario ) , about 1 litre versus 0.5 litres . 
  after four of the british provinces united in canadian confederation in 1867 , canada legally adopted the british imperial system of measure in 1873 , making canadian liquid units incompatible with american ones from that year forward . 
  [ 11 ] in 1873 , the french canadian `` pinte '' was defined as being one imperial quart or two imperial pints , while the imperial pint was legally called a `` chopine '' in french canada . 
  canadian imperial units of liquid measure remain incompatible with american traditional units to this day , and although the canadian pint , quart , and gallon are still legal units of measure in canada , they are still 20 % larger than the american ones . 
  [ snip ]  in australia and new zealand , a subtle change was made to 1 pint milk bottles during the conversion from imperial to metric in the 1970s . 
  the height and diameter of the milk bottle remained unchanged , so that existing equipment for handling and storing the bottles was unaffected , but the shape was adjusted to increase the capacity from 568 ml to 600 ml -- a conveniently rounded metric measure . 
  such milk bottles are no longer officially referred to as pints . 
  however the `` pint glass '' in pubs in australia remains closer to the standard imperial pint , at 570 ml . 
  it holds about 500 ml of beer and about 70 ml of froth , except in south australia where a pint is served in a 425 ml glass and a 570 ml glass is called an `` imperial pint '' . 
  in new zealand , there is no longer any legal requirement for beer to be served in standard measures : in pubs , the largest size of glass , which is referred to as a pint , varies , but usually contains 425 ml . 
  [ 16 ]   in canada , the `` pint of beer '' served in pubs and bars has long been considered a colloquial term for `` a large glass of beer '' . 
  legally speaking , after 1873 it was defined as one british imperial pint of 20 imperial ounces . 
  on the other hand , the united states continued to use a smaller 16 ounce pint , while in french canada after 1873 a `` pinte de bi\u00e8re '' was defined as a much larger 40 ounce quart of beer , so confusion arose to which was being used . 
  prior to 1961 , bottled beer in canada was served in two sizes , colloquially known as `` quarts '' and `` pints . '', 
  they were 22 and 12 imperial ounces ( 625 and 341 ml ) , respectively , which were much smaller than the british units . 
  some provinces banned the sale of beer in the larger bottle . 
  for example , in ontario in the 1950s only the smaller size could be sold , but in quebec both sizes were about equally common . 
  the numerous incompatibilities between traditional canadian , british , french , and american unit systems was one of the driving forces behind metrication in canada . 
  you may judge how helpful the similar terminology is . 
   you know how brits had australia ? 
  yeah , until the brits spent 80 years populating australia with brit miscreants , misfits , and n'er - do-wells , they [ sent 'em to what would later become the us for 160 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penal_transportation ) . 
   the us can annex bulgaria for their prison needs . 
  better to pay . 
  * the iraq war cost $ 1,900 b. 
  bulgaria 's gdp is $ 48b . 
  * still got ta pay market rate to operate the prisons anyway . 
  no savings . 
  * people in us territories have a tendency to just move to the mainland for higher wages ( e.g. 
  [ guam ] ( http://www.guampedia.com/chamorro-migration-to-the-u-s/ ) , [ puerto rico ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/14/puerto-ricans-leave-in-record-numbers-for-mainland-u-s/ ) ) . 
  it 's not clear why bulgarians would show any terrific interest in operating discount prisons in bulgaria in such a scenario . 
  * the eu would probably get cranky about being attacked and impose some huge-ass retroactive tax on apple again . 
  to be fair , it sounds like this was just a fine rather than jail time . 
  on the other hand , that 's not tiny . 
  i ca n't find current russian median household income online , but the average wage is available : [ this says ] ( http://www.dailysabah.com/economy/2016/05/24/average-monthly-salary-in-russia-fell-by-35-percent-in-2015-report-says ) :  a weakened ruble against the u.s. dollar caused the average russian monthly wage to drop to $ 558 last year , a 34 percent fall compared to 2014 , the report from moscow 's higher school of economics said . 
  the article says that the fine was 200k rubles . 
  rubusd is currently 0.0154 , so the fine was ~ $ 3080 . 
  so i guess you 're talking about half a year 's average pay as a penalty , which seems pretty substantial . 
  https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/jl5048.aspx the relevant press release with more details . 
  specifically what do you feel is missing ? 
  what i 'm hearing is that we could save 97 % of our prison spending by outsourcing to bulgaria . 
  edit : < disappointed  or not -- you gave one number per year ( and possibly in usd ) and the other in monthly spending . 
  would still save 56 % to 78 % . 
  we could imprison two , maybe three or four times as many people at that rate !, 
   top tory explains why we should return to imperial measures now and stick two fingers up to eu bureaucrats all right . 
  i 'm curious to see what he 's got . 
   we need to take a really strong line on this because we are no longer going to be pushed around in having exclusively metric measurements just because the european commission says we have to . 
  i 'm not actually sure that that 's a reason . 
   the criminalisation of retailers for daring to sell groceries in pounds and ounces was one of the biggest outrages of eu policy over the years . 
  ca n't they just give both ? 
   we have a complete culture of traditional thinking on the subject of imperial measurements and yet metric was just imposed on us . 
  i 'm not sure how much culture is bound to units . 
  surely use of english in the eu greatly outweighed the units shift in convenience . 
   the americans , with whom we trade quite happily , have in many respects similar imperial measurement systems to ours -- which is a help . 
  is it helpful that we [ both have a pint , but of different sizes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pint ) ? 
   but no one would suggest that because we still use the pound and drive on the left that we are incapable of dealing with europe . 
  were n't you already driving on the left ? 
  how is that relevant ? 
   the sun is calling for the return of blue brit passports , ditched for eu-backed burgundy would n't that be helpful to the eu , so that the color can be used to identify an eu member passport ? 
   restore our once-proud fishing industry , scrapping tough eu quotas . 
  i do n't know the details , but sounds like it could be legit . 
   axe eu-imposed vat on gas and electric for cheaper energy bills . 
  i mean , the funds still have to come from somewhere . 
   have cleaner carpets by swapping weak , eu-regulated vacuums for powerful ones . 
  fair enough . 
   defend our morning tea and toast by using appliances free of energy constraints . 
  fair enough . 
   have drier hair by avoiding planned eu energy rules on powerful hairdryers . 
  seems a bit like cheating if the rules are only proposed . 
   see the light by bringing back the incandescent bulb , phased out by eu regs . 
  i was never a fan of bans -- let the market work it out . 
  incandescents cost more to operate . 
  still , how much draw do they really have ? 
  i enjoy not changing bulbs all the time . 
   reclaim `` jam '' , as the eu says less than 60 per cent sugar means it 's a `` fruit spread '' . 
  you still had the term , right ? 
  just with standardized naming ?
