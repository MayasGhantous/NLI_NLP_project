  how about an eu official , like juncker or tusk ? 
  [ the ultimate heat death of the universe awaits us all ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heat_death_of_the_universe ) . 
   this map tells you everything you need to know about innovation in europe it failed to do so . 
  it 's retroactive if a policy rolls back tax law for past years . 
  normally , a country 's law is what i 'd expect to see as authoritative for operating there . 
  if ireland specifies a particular tax code , they should be authoritative on it . 
  otherwise , companies need to also evaluate the law code of the country itself and assign potential risks that various laws would be invalidated . 
  i would n't worry if the eu forced ireland to update their rules . 
  it would almost certainly piss off ireland , but that 's an ireland-eu matter . 
  i suspect that it would , in fact , make sense to harmonize multinational us-eu tax law . 
  nor is apple 's loss primarily of concern to me . 
  i do n't much agree with it , but if apple lost a bunch of money , as a one-off i would n't see it as something that would interrupt ongoing business . 
  but the potential for future incidents is . 
  why would someone put money into a company in a country if the country 's laws might be treated as invalid , and all their effects rolled back ? 
  optimizing tax status is an normal , standard practice . 
  that 's not something that businesses will stop -- seeking tax breaks or choosing states or countries with the most-favorable laws are a regular part of business . 
  this is not some sort of skullduggery . 
  i mean , i would n't want to invest in a company doing business in europe if it were subject to that sort of risk -- there 's no real way for the company to realistically assess risk very well . 
  the eu had the information required to act to cause ireland to change tax practices . 
  if the eu does not act on that , and if retroactivity is permitted , it opens risk of intentionally letting something go on and then seizing much more money than would have been the case -- that 's a significant misincentive . 
  and just to be clear -- i 'm not pushing the point because apple 's in the us . 
  i 'm generally sympathetic to the antitrust claims the eu raised against google -- and i rather like google more as a company , too . 
  it 's just that the google issue would have tended to produce a more-efficient market , whereas the apple one looks like it would rather harm the market in europe . 
  well , the government in question has control of whatever breaks it extends -- it 's not gon na extend a break if it is n't worth it for the locale . 
  on the other hand , in the us , federal and state taxation are also isolated . 
  that 's where my comparison was coming from . 
  you only ever need to have a minimum tax rate to address some sort of externalities , like providing national defense . 
  on everything else , you can keep locales competing and pressure on taxes to stay down . 
  in the us , a federal tax could handle externalities . 
  the eu does not currently have the power to tax , so it may need to force member states to set a minimum level of taxation and then require them to spend on particular things . 
  i 'm just saying that the idea of a minimum tax at first seemed absurd , but i guess i can see how it would compare as a mechanism , and why the eu would have one when the us does n't . 
  as best i can tell -- human dignity is not , as far as i know , a legal thing over here -- that 's fairly-vaguely-defined , yes ? 
  and thus we see the perils of not using ranked-choice voting with an option for each outcome : options that are preferred by the populace can be ignored in favor of those that are not . 
  [ tax `` haven '' ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_haven ) , like a sanctuary . 
   ( at least enough to actually do something ) russia 's being sanctioned . 
  it did n't result in a counter-invasion into russian-held territory , but it 's clearly not the case that nothing was done . 
   and refusing to make up some upper limit hmmm . 
  why do you think that this is a good thing ? 
  i mean , you may think that the upper limit is high enough that it wo n't be hit , but surely you 'd agree that there are practical limitations on what germany can handle . 
  if china 's entire population wanted to immigrate to germany , surely you 'd agree that germany would n't be able to handle it ? 
  http://www.dw.com/en/court-fines-italy-for-deporting-migrants-to-libya/a-15761455  the european court of human rights on thursday ordered italy to pay thousands of euros to two dozen immigrants it deported to libya in 2009 , saying it exposed them to the risk of ill treatment , including torture . 
  the [ european court of human rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_court_of_human_rights ) is n't part of the eu . 
  russia , greenland , turkey , etc are members of the echr , but not of the eu . 
   she meant we should have worked on a solution earlier , not let fewer people in . 
  well , the two are n't necessarily mutually-exclusive , mind . 
  yeah ... if the eu said `` ireland , your tax code is out of line with eu commitments , fix it '' , and apple was faced with higher taxes from here on out , i imagine that they 'd do the requisite complaining , but i ca n't imagine the us government taking a position on the issue . 
  but if you start retroactively-changing tax code , that raises two issues : first , what other companies are affected , and second , might something like this happen in the future ? 
  * deepwater horizon * was roughly an order of magnitude larger than * exxon valdez * , both in quantity of oil spilled and in costs eaten by the responsible party . 
     for the past 25 years or so ireland/netherlands/belgium / luxembourg have been fucking the rest of the eu with it 's 0,0005 % tax rate , now the eu has finally started doing something about this , although the measures are still patchy and barely working . 
  i believe that the issue is that the claim is retroactive . 
  that is , it 's possible to set tax laws wherever wanted ... but not to sit for 25 years and then say that you 're retroactively-increasing taxes . 
  think of it as something like a [ submarine patent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/submarine_patent ) : you ca n't tell people that the policy is one thing , have them operate that way and make financial decisions based on that , and then switch it . 
  i think that the reason that apple was in ireland was so that they would n't need to pay us tax . 
  that is , i do n't think that the us claimed tax in the past that they would n't have claimed . 
  why would the us give apple tax credits ? 
  what happens next time a retroactive tax decision is made ? 
  got ta side with switzerland on this one . 
  as cgpgrey has pointed out , that 's not [ quite straight either ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmkylia7mgw ) . 
  technically , they 're arcs along a great circle , so they are n't quite straight . 
  france does n't have [ vanity plates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vanity_plate ) , but if you 're in a country that does have them and you 've got a really good one for a tank , would n't want to be driving around without it . 
  [ well , it appears to sound like `` heh heh heh heh '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dznoykapuks ) . 
  in the us , you definitely can -- company says `` well ... * maybe * i 'd like to set up a factory here . 
  how much of a tax break are * you * gon na offer me versus < city 2  ? '', 
  either  # [ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross-linguistic_onomatopoeias#laughter ) or  # [ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross-linguistic_onomatopoeias#laughter ) edit : and it [ sounds like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nss35kevxm4&amp;t=30s ) . 
  canadian [ gas and oil networks are already connected to the us ] ( http://www.capp.ca/canadian-oil-and-natural-gas/infrastructure-and-transportation/pipelines ) , in much the same way that countries in europe are linking up . 
  if you can ship from the us , you 're effectively already shipping from canada . 
  unless the eu is trying to entirely-starve russia , it does n't serve any purpose . 
  by integrating the gas and oil networks and arranging for multiple suppliers , the eu places a cap on how much that oil and gas can cost in the future -- whatever the * next * - highest supplier is going to charge . 
  paying at that cap unnecessarily just costs the eu more . 
  it already caps leverage available via russia adjusting energy access . 
  i would assume that the ec has some sort of mechanism to enforce their rulings . 
  hmm . 
  is n't the reason that apple is in ireland in the first place because ireland is in the single market ? 
  i mean , i 'm sure that if they just needed a country that some tiny island would charge minimal rates . 
  weeelll ... you probably did benefit from things that someone else had funded when entering , right ? 
  i mean , it would seem symmetric to not benefit but pay into future projects when leaving . 
  apparently the eu has unsuccessfully tried going after boeing for tax breaks in the us as being anticompetitive . 
  tax breaks are n't uncommon here ... dunno how the eu compares . 
  however , if this claim is made based on internal eu rules and those rules are solid , i suppose that might make the difference . 
  one major potential difference between the eu and the us : the us can levy a federal tax on businesses . 
  as i understand it , the eu can not . 
  it must take payments from a country 's tax revenue . 
  so maybe there 's more justification for limiting the minimum tax that a member country can levy than in the us . 
  that being said , lotr is designed to provide you with an * experience * . 
  most non-fiction is n't . 
  if you do n't need to be made to empathize with some character so that you can be shocked when he dies , it probably * is * quicker to just get an overview and get more information on the bits that are relevant to you . 
  i do read books because finely detailed information on some topics , like history , is still best available in book form . 
  however , i agree that for high level information , wikipedia is just plain better . 
  most of what i read in a book is irrelevant information . 
  i can typically jump right to what i want to know with google . 
  you 'd think that . 
  there needs to be a term for something of little practical policy importance but which draws tremendous political attention . 
  it 's a terribly useful device in politics , because it permits appealing to people and affecting elections without having to actually handcuff oneself to policy . 
  it 's close to but not * quite * a [ red herring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_herring ) , because that does n't have any political connotation and is really more about diverting discussion from some other specific thing . 
  it 's not a [ macguffin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macguffin ) . 
  it 's not quite a [ wedge issue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wedge_issue ) , because that could have meaningful political impact . 
  these are typically rules that have to do with culture and which would have little practical impact one way or another on society , but which drive people and political advocates into an absolute frenzy . 
  i guess basically merging `` red herring '' and `` wedge issue '' would give what i want . 
  the term `` spanish '' in the us would be much-more-frequently used to refer to the spanish language than to something related to the country of spain . 
  by far the context in which this comes up the most is mexico .
