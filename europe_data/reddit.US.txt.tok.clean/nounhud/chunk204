  it 's not so much due to confusion so much as the word is ambiguous . 
  it * is * probably true that people know more about mexico than spain , though . 
  searching for `` spain '' would n't permit for the ambiguity , and would give [ stuff related to spain ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1432&amp;bih=1073&amp;q=spain ) -- but that also would n't really bring up people or culture , which is what i was hoping for in those searches .

  to be fair , i suspect that if you did all the above searches using the spanish adjectival terms instead of the english adjectival terms , you might wind up with a different view ... edit : [ espa\u00f1ol ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1432&amp;bih=1073&amp;q=+espa\u00f1ol ) : nope,

  figured i could get that adjectival right without resorting to wikipedia ; guess not . 
  i will do so . 
   nostalgic communist grannies this one i do n't understand . 
  i can completely understand how russia took an economic nosedive in the 1990s , and why there might be nostalgia there . 
  in real per-capita gdp terms , russia is barely above where it was in 1990 ( admittedly , partly due to the sanctions ) . 
  but eastern germany rose to over twice its reunification-era per-capita gdp . 
  that seems like a pretty substantial improvement , and i 'd have thought that there 'd have been a meaningful standard-of-living improvement in eastern germany .

  this almost without exception did not show up in western europe . 
  i am wondering whether this has something to do with relative job opportunities for women in those countries and how much modeling for western companies relatively pays .

  [ estonia ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1432&amp;bih=1073&amp;q=estonian ) ) did not follow this model , other than maybe [ latvia ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1432&amp;bih=1073&amp;q=latvian ) to some degree .

  [ estonia ] ( https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1432&amp;bih=1073&amp;q=estonian ) too , actually .

  * the more-familiar the english-speaking world seems to be with a country ( well , or at least an ethnicity ... ) , the more-abstract the results seem to be -- e.g.

   before then it used ethnic quotas . 
  ie the demographic proportion of migrants had to match the proportion of that ethnic group in the us . 
  the us did n't have any form of immigration restrictions or mechanisms to even control immigration up until something like 1870 : it was effectively open-border . 
  the [ chinese exclusion act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_exclusion_act ) was the first form of ethnic restriction , in 1882 . 
  the first ethnic quotas based on percentages of existing population were put into place in 1921 with the [ emergency quota act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emergency_quota_act ) . 
  between 1946 and 1965 , all ethnic restrictions were removed and we moved to primarily skill-based immigration . 
  so quotas were n't really in place for a terribly-long chunk of us history .

  this trend accelerated among the puerto rican community in the united states in the 1960s .

  to avoid situations where the jilted husband goes after the guy in question . 
  hmm . 
  seems like he could sue `` john doe , father of x '' and have the state hold onto the identity . 
  let 's set aside that debate for now . 
  my point is that you were asking why illegal immigrants were skipping germany to head to the uk -- one reason is that it 's easier to work illegally . 
  hmm . 
  you guys have id cards . 
  hmm . 
  i do n't understand what the benefit of disclosing it to the husband is . 
  i mean , i 'm completely sympathetic with him knowing that it 's someone else 's kid -- hell , i 'd support paternity tests being part of the hospital process for having a kid . 
  and some official has to know if the costs can be recovered from the responsible party or whatever . 
  but i do n't see how the system would work better because of the husband knowing who the guilty party is . 
  he did n't * tell * them what to do . 
  he did n't say `` you 'd better not unify or else '' . 
  he just said that it was n't practical . 
  i do n't understand all the politics involved , but that does n't seem unreasonable . 
  according to wikipedia , it presently has majority support in romania but not moldova : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_romania_and_moldova  a poll conducted by iri in moldova in november 2008 showed that 29 % of the population would support a union with romania , while 61 % would reject it .

  i dunno about europe , but in the us , almost nothing . 
  the bbg-run international broadcasters can be viewed in the us on the web -- arguably , they should try and geolocate and block at least us ips , since ( in the radio era ) they were explicitly not allowed by congress to broadcast in the us .
