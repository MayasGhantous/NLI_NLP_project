  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:hungarian_engineers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:polish_engineers both seem to have managed to get a number of things done . 
   there comes a time when the doom merchants need to admit that they are simply wrong . 
  i 'm dubious . 
  [ matthew 16:27 -28 ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2016:27-28&amp;version=kj21 )  for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels , and then he shall reward every man according to his works . 
    verily i say unto you , there are some standing here who shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom . '' -- jesus https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/predictions_and_claims_for_the_second_coming_of_christ that one 's been running for two millenia now . 
  how can stiglitz `` admit '' it when he 's been advocating an anti-euro position for years ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_calais_\\ ( 1558 \\ )  however , in 1562 upon the outbreak of the french wars of religion england 's new queen , elizabeth i , revived her kingdom 's claims to calais and occupied the french port of le havre in order to keep it until france should restore calais . 
  [ 3 ] :120 french forces ejected the english in 1563 , and the treaty of troyes ( 1564 ) effectively recognized french ownership of calais in exchange for payment to england of only 120,000 crowns . 
  [ 4 ] although the treaty made no mention of calais , the french paid the 120,000 crowns in return for all rights to le havre and freedom of commerce was agreed between the two countries . 
  the french believed that the occupation of le havre meant the english had forfeited all rights to calais , and elizabeth was in no position to press the case any further . 
  [ 5 ] huh . 
  what does being a republic have to do with it one way or another ? 
  [ they may not have keys . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shawn_nelson_\\ ( plumber \\ ) )  american best known for going on a tank rampage in san diego , california [ snip ]  the tanks involved started with a push button and did not require an ignition key . 
  not so much the internet as french artists and photographers , who are gon na become invisible online . 
  they claim global jurisdiction here , right ? 
  so it is as much of an issue for , say , the same company in ireland . 
  23andme does dna tests via mail -- which i imagine is more-expensive than just getting a genetic fingerprint at an immigration facility -- for $ 200 . 
  course , they can probably offset the cost via data-mining . 
   a record 4,542 asylum seekers withdrew their applications and left sweden in the first eight months of 2016 as a result of long processing times , strict new rules on family reunion , and payouts to migrants who voluntarily returned to their country of origin . 
  ~ 6,000 per year giving up asylum applications . 
  163,000 applied for asylum in sweden last year . 
   of course france and spain would never concede to such a deal . 
  why would they ? 
  i 'm doubtful . 
  the same objection would presumably apply to other ftas , but the eu successfully negotiated ftas in the past . 
  i see articles online saying that the geographic indicator issue is still unresolved , and i suspect that that 's more-relevant . 
  checking online , geographic indicators are apparently still unresolved . 
  the eu still wants to own `` feta '' and similar , and the us still says no . 
  agriculture ... 
   which to be fair is pretty much how the eu has always worked . 
  hmm . 
  the problem with `` ask for forgiveness , rather than permission '' is that it tends to make whoever is on the receiving end annoyed . 
  i 'll grant that [ things did n't go all that smoothly over here , either ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/world/paris-attacks-syrian-refugees-backlash/ ) ... and our numbers were about two to three orders of magnitude smaller . 
  the * new york times * ( socially center-left ) was pretty gung-ho on calling europe inhumane over it for quite a while . 
  lot of their articles got posted here when they were on that schtick . 
  they were rather short on calling for the us to ship a bunch of 'em over to the us , though ... 
   this * as you said * will not be happening in eastern bloc countries anytime soon and so i have been looking into possibly moving there . 
  ( either polska or czechia )   failing that i 'd move to the south in the usa where things are a little more traditional . 
  well ... i 'm not sure what `` traditional '' is a euphemism for . 
  if it 's `` white '' , then you may be disappointed by the us south , which [ is n't particularly white ] ( http://demographics.coopercenter.org/dotmap/ ) . 
  if it 's `` christian '' , then you 'll certainly get that . 
  [ the southeast is mostly protestant , and the southwest mostly catholic . 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/02/26/the-religious-states-of-america-in-22-maps/ ) if it 's `` identifying as irish '' , that 's [ mostly in the northeast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_americans ) . 
  if it 's `` following european holidays , eating european foods , knowing european traditions '' , that 's pretty much everywhere in the us , but frankly , that 's a lot of the world , too . 
  you mentioned `` drinking '' . 
  the us is n't dry , not anymore ( though mormons do n't drink ) but [ drinks less on a per-capita basis than ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capital ) . 
  you mentioned `` family '' . 
  ireland apparently has [ the lowest divorce rate in the eu ] ( http://m.independent.ie/life/family/family-features/why-does-ireland-have-the-lowest-divorce-rate-in-the-eu-34217513.html ) at 13 % . 
  [ in the us , it 's more like 30 % ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/divorce_in_the_united_states ) . 
  [ 50.5 % of us households are a married couple . ] ( http://www.statemaster.com/graph/lif_per_of_hou_tha_are_mar_fam-percent-households-married-couple-families ) . 
  in the republic of ireland , it 's [ about the same ] ( http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile5/profile_5_households_and_families_full_doc_sig_amended.pdf ) . 
  he 's not a shill . 
  hell , he 's not even enthusiastic about putin . 
  he 's also a long-time mod and contributor here . 
  germany was n't in fantastic shape either . 
   `` you are green , it is true ; but they are green also . 
  you are all green alike . '' -- abraham lincoln to general mcdowell , who was complaining that his men were not yet ready to fight . 
  [ arguably not the best quote : mcdowell proceeded to lose the battle . ], 
   16k per month , about 200k per year . 
  so germany needs to build a city like freiburg or l\u00fcbeck each year to handle the population growth . 
  no , because the pre-existing population in germany is diminishing quickly due to low fertility rates . 
  that will free up the real estate that was once theirs for newcomers to have . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11644660/germany-dominance-over-as-demographic-crunch-worsens.html  chancellor angela merkel warned in a speech in davos earlier this year that germany will lose a net 6m workers over the next 15 years , shrinking gradually over the rest of this decade before going into free-fall . 
  he 's a famously anti-nato regular . 
  was an invasion , but not an annexation . 
  us trade with russia [ has dropped substantially since 2013 ] ( https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4621.html ) . 
  the us has very little trade with russia -- about $ 7b exported to russia , $ 16b imported . 
  i 'd be fine with cutting off trade completely , personally , but even a complete cut just would n't do that much . 
  neither is an important trading partner of the other . 
  while i agree on the overall point , to be fair , i do n't think that there are any sanctions currently contingent on mh17 . 
  nor would i support there being such . 
  in donbas and crimea , there is a remedy -- leave . 
  however , this is not the case for mh17 . 
  russia ca n't `` fix '' mh17 , ca n't bring the passengers back to life or repair the plane . 
  so the only thing you could hope for is : * official acknowledgement . 
  i suppose that the family of some victims might want this , but i just do n't think that this merits sanctions . 
  * restitution . 
  this is just a money question . 
  sanctions cost more than the cost of what the people involved lost . 
  cheaper to pay out a pension if russia 's not willing to do so . 
  i do n't think that russia intends to make a practice of shooting down airliners in the future . 
  * because sometimes people enjoy having good publicity for doing things . 
  i 'm not adverse to giving out credit where it 's due . 
  * because it helps set the bar for the rest of society via public attention . 
  * because some people would like to read about , say , someone giving a lot of money and someone risking something that they worked hard for to save some kid 's life rather than gruesome details of some serial murder somewhere . 
  < shrug  different approaches have different drawbacks and benefits . 
  i 'm pretty comfortable with a substantial prison capacity , yeah . 
  economics is not part of core curriculum in the us either . 
   overcrowded at 70k you * could * construct more . 
  the us only has five times france 's population , but total incarceration of 2.2 m. 
  apple is , as far as i know , legally conforming to us tax law . 
  same with irish tax law . 
  they may be doing their damnedest to structure things to mobilize tax liability , but afaik , they 're conforming . 
  it 's possible that it may make sense to change those laws -- maybe they benefit multinationals to an inefficient degree relative to smaller companies . 
  but saying `` our tax law could be better designed '' is different from saying `` someone is breaking the law '' . 
  that the french will use puppies to advance trade negotiations ? 
   it 's not too different from the southern states ' governors jointly refusing to accept gay marriage or refugee quotas , proposed by obama . ', 
  the federal government theoretically has authority over immigration . 
  juncker does n't have that authority , nor merkel ... there is no centralized power in the eu who can direct it , which means that any country can let in what it individually wants to let in ... but also ca n't stop others from letting things in .
