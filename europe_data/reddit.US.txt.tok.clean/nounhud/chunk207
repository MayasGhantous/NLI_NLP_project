  i mean , it seems like something of an artificial line . 
  if bulgaria and russia got into an actual spat , bulgaria would n't be able to singlehandedly fight them off anyway . 
  that means that bulgaria 's military would make up part of that opposition , not all of it . 
  what would make patrol flights in particular special as a component of the capability bulgaria should have independently ? 
  bulgaria would give up , say , some number of infantrymen or some number of tanks or some number of drones to get a certain number of fighter jets . 
  why is that an obviously sensible tradeoff ? 
  i 'd say that it 's the other way around . 
  sanders incorrectly called himself a `` socialist '' but advocated for policies that were at most social democratic . 
  we 're gon na have a spare mr. brexit after the elections . 
  come to what ? 
  i 'd call myself globalist in that i support trade and oppose isolation . 
  i do n't think that large-scale non-skill-based immigration is a good idea , though , and i do n't normally think of that as being entailed by ` globalism ' . 
  that 's kinda classy-looking . 
   in one instance , wolfgang ebel 's krr issued an `` excavation permit '' to the principality of sealand ( a micronation ) , who then had men dig up a plot of land in the harz region in search of the amber room for two weeks , until the landowner hired a private security service to drive them off . 
  [ 7 ] hahaha awesome . 
   ties to the russian orthodox church and alleged support of stalin seems hard to do both . 
  stalin was general secretary 3 april 1922 -- 16 october 1952 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_christians_in_the_soviet_union  the orthodox church suffered terribly in the 1930s , and many of its members were killed or sent to labor camps . 
  between 1927 and 1940 , the number of orthodox churches in the russian republic fell from 29,584 to fewer than 500 . 
  the watershed year was 1929 , when soviet policy put much new legislation in place that formed the basis for the harsh anti-religious persecution in the 1930s . 
    anti-religious education was introduced beginning in the first-grade in 1928 and anti-religious work was intensified throughout the education system . 
  at the same time , in order to remove the church 's intellectuals and support official propaganda that only backward people believed in god , [ 68 ] the government conducted a massive purge of christian intellectuals , most of whom died in the camps or in prison . 
  [ 69 ]   the church 's successful competition with the ongoing and widespread atheistic propaganda , prompted new laws to be adopted in 1929 on ` religious associations ' as well as amendments to the constitution , which forbade all forms of public , social , communal , educational , publishing or missionary activities for religious believers . 
  [ 67 ] this also prevented , of course , the church from printing any material for public consumption or responding to the criticism against it . 
  this caused many religious tracts to be circulated as illegal literature orsamizdat . 
  [ 24 ] numerous other measures were introduced that were designed to cripple the church , and effectively made it illegal to have religious activities of any sort outside of liturgical services within the walls of the few churches that would remain open , and even these would be subject to much interference and harassment . 
  catechism classes , religious schools , study groups , sunday schools and religious publications were all illegal and/or banned . 
    the league of the militant godless ( lmg ) , underyemelyan yaroslavsky , was the main instrument of the anti-religious campaign and it was given special powers that allowed it to dictate to public institutions throughout the country what they needed to do for the campaign . 
  [ 42 ]   after 1929 and through the 1930s , the closing of churches , mass arrests of the clergy and religiously active laity , and persecution of people for attending church reached unprecedented proportions . 
  [ 2 ] [ 67 ] the lmg employed terror tactics against believers in order to further the campaign , while employing the guise of protecting the state or prosecuting law-breakers . 
  the clergy were attacked as foreign spies and trials of bishops were conducted with their clergy as well as lay adherents who were reported as ` subversive terroristic gangs ' that had been unmasked . 
  [ 70 ] official propaganda at the time called for the banishment of the very concept of god from the soviet union . 
  [ 71 ] from 1932 to 1937 joseph stalin declared the ` five-year plans of atheism ' and the lmg was charged with completely eliminating all religious expression in the country . 
  [ 71 ] many of these same methods and terror tactics were also imposed against others that the regime considered to be its ideological enemies . 
    the debate between the ` rightist ' and ` leftist ' sides of how to best combat religion found some conclusion in 1930 and afterwards , when the state officially condemned extremes on both sides . 
  marxist leaders who took either position on this issue would find themselves attacked by a paranoid stalin who did not tolerate other authorities to speak as authorities on public policy . 
  [ 73 ]   a lull in the active persecution was experienced in 1930-33 following stalin 's 1930 article ` diziness from success ' , however , it swept back in fervor again afterwards . 
  [ 74 ]   in 1934 the persecution of the renovationist sect began to reach the proportions of the persecution of the old orthodox church . 
  [ 75 ]   during the purges of 1937 and 1938 , church documents record that 168,300 russian orthodox clergy were arrested . 
  of these , over 100,000 were shot . 
  [ 76 ] many thousands of victims of persecution became recognized in a special canon of saints known as the `` new martyrs and confessors of russia '' . 
    a decline in enthusiasm in the campaign occurred in the late 1930s . 
  [ 77 ] the tone of the anti-religious campaign changed and became more moderate . 
  [ 71 ] it ended at the outbreak of world war ii . 
    official soviet figures reported that up to one third of urban and two thirds of rural population still held religious beliefs by 1937 . 
  however , the anti-religious campaign of the past decade and the terror tactics of the militantly atheist regime , had effectively eliminated all public expressions of religion and communal gatherings of believers outside of the walls of the few churches that still held services . 
  [ 78 ] this was accomplished in a country that only a few decades earlier had had a deeply christian public life and culture that had developed for almost a thousand years . 
  i bet that if an intern came in wearing a flying spaghetti monster collander that they 'd be asked to take it off . 
  what about intolerance of intolerance ? 
  i disagree . 
  it might be a good idea , but there 's no inherent incompatibility . 
  hell , you can run a church democratically . 
   german-built leopard tanks operated by the turkish army have followed in their wake ... welp , we 've now got substantial ground forces of a nato member in an active war zone that russia 's been bombing . 
  let 's see if the [ doomsday clock ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doomsday_clock ) guys knock another minute off . 
   `` we joined russia and they stopped giving a damn about us , '' yevgeny , a worker at a titanium plant in the town of armyansk told reuters . 
  [ snip ]  fearing reprisals from his boss , yevgeny declined to give his surname , as did other workers who spoke to reuters . 
  you know , `` yevgeny , a titanium plant worker in the town of armyansk '' does n't sound as if it 's that terribly-well anonymized . 
  without it , it would be possible for a plan to go through which is opposed by the majority ( which is probably the case for any one brexit plan ) . 
  the original referendum let all options `` gang up '' on remain , even though only one exit plan could be taken . 
  it 's like you 're watching the most popular movie out there and have a vote on `` should we change this '' . 
  any change will make people on the net less happy , but as long as a majority has at least one other movie that they prefer , they can truthfully say ` yes ' when asked whether they 'd want a change ... even though any * specific * change would not win . 
  because it has little real world impact and will keep the right occupied ? 
  based on the relative sizes of our respective direct hot conflicts with russia , finland 's probably got more grounds to ask for our * bona fides * than the other way around . 
  look , let 's say that you 're a brit . 
  you 've got a bunch of romanians doing [ crazy shit like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foh_jxidsvi ) . 
  do you see brits doing that ? 
  no , dammit , you do not . 
  that 's going to be weird and vaguely-unsettling . 
  romanians might break out with that in the middle of london . 
  dances should be [ more kiwi , more in line with british culture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi851yjuqqw ) . 
   and afaik the national guard had been used to squash on protesters before if you 're thinking of the [ kent state massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kent_state_shootings ) , yes , but that was only because they were operating under the state governor . 
  the federal government would n't have been permitted to use them in that role . 
  if you wanted an eu comparison , it would be that , say , after some theoretical federalization that granted brussels the ability to take control of spain 's military , spain 's military could n't be ordered by brussels to do any law enforcement in the eu , but spain could still use it to do so . 
  in all fairness , the last link there , the us memorial day parade , has a pretty substantially-different tone -- this is thanking and talking about retired soldiers . 
  for whatever reason , the us does n't seem to go in all that much for military marching parades , and it 's something that i 've wondered about for a while -- i went trying to find some footage of large numbers of active-duty us soldiers parading a while back , and discovered that there really are n't a lot of instances out there . 
  that does n't mean that it does n't do shows of strength , but it 's not usually large blocks of infantry doing a funky walk . 
  the us navy likes doing glamour shots of ships sailing in formation , ( though they 're often multinational with allies ) : * [ us and japan ] ( https://www.navycs.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/uss-gw-japan-ships.jpg ) * [ us naval forces in valiant shield 2006 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/valiant_shield_formation.jpg ) and [ three us carrier strike groups from same ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/us_navy_060618-n-8591h-383_the_kitty_hawk%2c_ronald_reagan_and_abraham_lincoln_carrier_strike_groups_sail_in_formation.jpg ) .

  the [ blue angels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_angels ) do airshows for the navy . 
  the [ thunderbirds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_air_force_thunderbirds ) do the same for the us air force . 
  these guys have [ highly-choreographed displays ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6kbdopu5qq ) . 
  there 's also footage up of various combined us-south korea `` elephant walks '' , showing how much air power could be put up in a conflict with north korea . 
  [ example with f-16s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19h06ijyac0 ) . 
  i 've wondered if it 's to showcase strong points . 
  countries that have numerically-large infantry groups seem to do the infantry marches . 
  [ north korea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj30xa05ci0 ) , [ china ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhzu7iigty ) , [ russia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdfvnhlbe7u ) . 
  the us , on the other hand , has a relatively ( given its overall military strength ) small infantry force , both in per-capita and in absolute terms . 
  but it has very large naval force , a lot of aircraft , and a lot of allied countries , so that might be something that it would presumably want to show off . 
  if so , that 'd nicely explain large multinational formations of ships with aircraft flying overhead . 
   this is expansionist / imperialist nationalism in all fairness , the rooskies are n't playing * [ hell march ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/music_of_the_command_%26_conquer_series#command_.26_conquer:_red_alert ) * at their military parades . 
  i mean , you could set queen elizabeth picking flowers to metal music and it 'd sound menacing too . 
   the eu can dispatch the `` federal guard '' and send people outside of the region that can act less scrupulously since they do n't associate with the population . 
  the us has the [ posse comitatus act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/posse_comitatus_act ) as one of several things done to address such concerns in the us . 
  if the eu had similar legislation , would you be comfortable with it ? 
  < headscratch  well ... it depends on what `` we '' means . 
  if you mean `` the netherlands '' ... the netherlands was a supporter of and involved in of all three of the iraq , libya and syria military interventions . 
  libya was primarily-driven by france , though i suppose that political changes resulting from unifying french foreign policy with the eu 's might result in a lack of enough support for the initial push to go forward . 
  that seems more like an internal shift in eu politics , though , rather than shifting bargaining position vis-a-vis the us in some way .
