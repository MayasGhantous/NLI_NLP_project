  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_von_bismarck  in 1862 , king wilhelm i appointed bismarck as minister president of prussia , a position he would hold until 1890 ( except for a short break in 1873 ) . 
  he provoked three short , decisive wars against denmark , austria , and france , aligning the smaller german states behind prussia in its defeat of france . 
  in 1871 he formed the german empire with himself as chancellor , while retaining control of prussia . 
  his diplomacy of realpolitik and powerful rule at home gained him the nickname the `` iron chancellor . '', 
  i mean ... i have n't been following european affairs closely for all of merkel 's chancellorship , but i do n't recall her managing to provoke even * one * war against any of those three . 
   while the reichstag , germany 's parliament , was elected by universal male suffrage , it did not have much control of government policy ; bismarck distrusted democracy and ruled through a strong , well-trained bureaucracy with power in the hands of a traditional junker elite that consisted of the landed nobility . 
  nor is she a male aristocrat . 
   following unification , germany became one of the most powerful nations in europe . 
  bismarck 's astute , cautious , and pragmatic foreign policies allowed germany to peacefully retain the powerful position into which he had brought it ; maintaining amiable diplomacy with almost all european nations . 
  france was the main exception because of the franco -- prussian war and bismarck 's harsh subsequent policies ; france became one of germany 's most bitter enemies in europe .

  if : * the education is successful in imparting needed skills . 
  * people stay in the country . 
  no sense in paying if everyone then goes back to < country x  and does their work there . 
  * the alternative is having the same people without education present . 
  for example , the education itself does n't represent the dominant pull factor . 
  ... then i agree . 
  education dramatically changes what a country can do , and you 're better off with an educated citizen than an uneducated one . 
   two police officers were injured in the attack , one seriously , but were expected to survive . 
  :-( was semi-successful . 
  that 's why i said :  being sent to their base in the first place . 
  as for nato using satellite data , showing the aircraft at the airbase would be sufficient . 
  that was in response to the transponder bit , which broadcasts an aircraft identification -- you would n't need to intercept anything . 
  i was thinking of acars , but [ apparently there are also other things that military aircraft also broadcast ] ( http://mt-milcom.blogspot.com/2013/12/monitoing-military-aircraft-using-hfdl.html?m=1 ) . 
  and that 's for the amateur monitoring case -- nato will be able to use satellite intelligence . 
  military aircraft being sent to the base in the first place . 
  eh , i 'll still take polandball over real life . 
   it has nothing to do with economics , it 's to do with the fact that the uk and new zealand have essentially the same culture . 
  bojo 's talking about a trade agreement with the kiwis , not a freedom-of-movement-and-labor agreement . 
  if they 're running transponders , it 's ~ $ 100 for the hardware to receive it . 
  online sources that aggregate and track that data . 
  if not , it 's still vulnerable to active radar . 
  and i 'm sure that nato can follow 'em . 
  just as russia would have an interest in driving a wedge between turkey and the rest of nato , so nato would stand to benefit from splitting iran and russia by releasing that information .

   true , but 4000 + , among which stuff like the tzar bomb ? 
  only one tsar bomba was built . 
  that was detonated and no longer exists . 
  to be fair , most of that is n't the cost of war , but of trying to develop afghanistan . 
   by contrast , nearly 13 years after the taliban were overthrown , the us and other donors continue to fund 60 per cent of the afghan national budget and are pledged to underwrite a further `` decade of transformation '' in the country .

  hmm . 
  i do n't know how viable his proposed spending is , but funding his domestic policy might require gutting the british military capability to obtain some of the funds .

  there 's the tropical [ british virgin islands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_virgin_islands ) , which is a british territory .

  pretty sure that the original twitter post was tongue-in-cheek . 
  also , just to be clear , it 's libertarian [ in the us sense of the word ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarianism_in_the_united_states ) -- right-libertarian , not opposed to capitalism . 
   [ although the word * libertarian * ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarianism ) continues to be widely used to refer to socialists internationally , its meaning in the united states has deviated from its political origins . 
  [ 21 ] [ 22 ] libertarianism in the united states has been described as conservative on economic issues and liberal on personal freedom [ 23 ] ( for common meanings of conservative and liberal in the united states ) ; it is also often associated with a foreign policy of non-interventionism . 
  i do n't see how you 'd keep it secret . 
  there are tons of people monitoring aircraft out there . 
   the parliamentary representative in charge of the german military , hans-peter bartels , said the unfolding debate was , however , merely hypothetical in nature and not part of an actual agenda . 
    `` conscription would only be considered if there was a grave , long-lasting situation of danger , such as was the case with the cold war , '' he told the daily regional newspaper `` neue osnabr\u00fccker zeitung . '',

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_language  a first language ( also native language , father tongue/mother tongue , arterial language , or l1 ) is the language or are the languages a person has been exposed to from birth [ 1 ] or within the critical period , or that a person speaks the best and so is often the basis for sociolinguistic identity [ citation needed ] . 
  ** in some countries , the terms native language or mother tongue refer to the language of one 's ethnic group rather than one 's first language .

  the [ us coast guard ] ( http://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1250&amp;context=umialr ) apparently also considers firing at ships to stop them acceptable if they ca n't be stopped via other methods ... but this is definitely right on the border and could go either way , were the coast guard ship in the us . 
  relevant international and us law from the above : * [ * tennessee v. garner * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tennessee_v._garner ) : us supreme court ruling that law enforcement may not use deadly force just to stop someone fleeing unless there 's reason to believe that he may cause harm . 
  * [ * united states v. del prado-montero * ] ( http://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1761&amp;context=sulr ) : it is acceptable for the uscg to use military forces to fire upon and disable vessels that do not stop :  on july 14 , 1983 , after making radar contact , coast guard officials aboard a u.s. navy destroyer , the u.s.s. 
  kidd , sighted the ranger at twilight , noting that it was heading due west toward both the bahamas and the united states , that it carried 5 or 6 antennae ( more than normal ) and that it obviously carried some cargo , the hull being down to the waterline . 
  no name or markings could be seen at the time . 
  by radio the ranger 's master responded to inquiries , saying that there was no cargo , that the vessel was being delivered from antigua to new owners in freeport in the bahamas , and that there were no documents aboard nor any main beam number discoverable . 
  the master also reported that the vessel was of honduran registry . 
  he first gave 31483 as the registration number , then he gave 331483 . 
  neither number included the three letters traditionally denoting honduran registry . 
  when asked why the vessel was northeast of a normal course from antigua to freeport , he evidenced no concern . 
  he refused a consensual boarding , saying that the ranger had a faulty governor and could not start once it had stopped . 
   subsequently , the coast guard initiated a request through governmental channels and ascertained , by 1:30 p.m. of the following day , july 15 , that the ranger 's registry had been `` refuted '' by honduras . 
  the kidd , after ordering the ranger to stop twice and being twice refused , sounded general quarters . 
  at 7:00 p.m. , the coast guard ensign was raised on the kidd , signifying its coast guard control and mission . 
  the kidd fired warning shots on both the evening of the 15th and the morning of the 16th , and then resorted to firing disabling shots , which finally brought the ranger to a halt . 
  thereafter the ranger was boarded by a party headed by a coast guard officer . 
   the observations made by the boarding party , as testified to by coast guard witnesses , are relevant to and dispositive of the challenge all defendants make to the sufficiency of the evidence . 
  just before the boarding a person on board the ranger was seen shredding and throwing into the ocean a paper containing what looked like the contour lines , longitude and latitude markings of a chart . 
  the total crew consisted of nine and had been on this voyage for 14 days . 
  only three or four would have been required if there had been no need to unload cargo , i.e. , if the only obligation of the crew was to deliver the vessel to freeport .
