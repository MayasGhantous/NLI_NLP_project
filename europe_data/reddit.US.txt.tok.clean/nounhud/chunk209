  on boarding the ranger , the coast guard personnel found the odor of marijuana `` very noticeable . '', 
  in the middle and aft holds , 881 bales of marijuana , weighing over 57,000 pounds , were found . 
  obviously , firing to disable a ship is going to carry some risk of killing off people or sinking the ship . 
  * [ unclos article 110 ] ( http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm ) covers stops in international waters ( and it 's not clear to me whether the event was in greek or international waters ) . 
  i 'm not sure whether that would prohibit , authorize , or does n't define behavior . 
  the university of miami law school article that i linked to up top seemed to take the position that it was compatible with at least disabling fire of vessels without a legitimate flag . 
  the statement here ( from a journalist ; probably not authoritative as to actual motivations ) :  `` normally they shoot out the engine , '' he explains , `` but there were many refugees next to the engine . '' so ... it 's kinda complicated . 
  it looks like the details here are not defined in international law . 
  for us law , this might also be undefined . 
  if the journalist is correct as to motivation ( the greek coast guard would have fired to attempt to disable the ship , but was unable to do so , and so fell back to shooting people ) , it * might * be permissable . 
  i guess that it would depend on what the rationale for * tennessee v. garner * was : whether the issue there is that on land , there are better alternatives for continuing chase and in a naval environment , that may not be the case , or whether it 's simply that the tradeoff of killing the person is n't worth the stop . 
  if one * ca n't * stop a vessel because people are sitting around the engine , and the boat can outrun the coast guard vessel , that 'd obviously create a loophole ( put people around your engine ) , and there 's obviously good reason to want to avoid that .

  i 've fasted for a week for the hell of it . 
  * water matters , but there 's typically already water supplies for a while -- a toilet tank ( the clean , sanitary area , not the bowl ) will hold water in an emergency , even if water utilities lose power and thus pumping capacity . 
  hmm . 
  there are foods that can make use of preserved apples that can be exported or sold over a longer period .

  err . 
  this would be leaving , not kicking someone out . 
  my point is that it was said very strongly , but at least to me , i 'd think of it as something that i could see not * wanting * , but it 's hard to believe that it 's absolutely and utterly unacceptable .

  i 'm dubious that there is anyone who was an adult in the ussr and did n't have * some * fond memories . 
   so to sum up , you have nothing but belief in the lies , mis-truths , and obfuscation of your government and media to make your comment on no , i know that romania , turkey , and the us have no reason to want to damage their reputation . 
  i know that nuclear weapon movement involved large debates in the past . 
  i know that an anonymous source is unwilling to have something attributed to him , and that the only article that was a link to that material itself contained a rebuttal . 
  i know that the additional mentions came from sources established and funded with the goal of propagandizing , and even those did no more than reference the original dubious source . 
   you actually know nothing we could all be [ brains in vats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brain_in_a_vat ) , the world around us a simulation . 
  but we do n't let that theoretical possibility paralyze us ; the standard of evidence for knowing something always involves some level of assessment of reliability . 
  to say that one has to judge reputability is not to say that one can know nothing . 
   kinda like god exists because some pretty nifty short story writers said so , eh . 
  no , i use the same process for judging the bible . 
  it makes many claims that require extraordinary mental contortions or interpretation as metaphor to believe . 
  many people have accepted incompatible religious views via similar mechanisms . 
  just as i would not consider the bible a reliable source , so would i not this anonymous source in a speculative article . 
   you know nothing for sure , but come here been all indignant and patriotic and yet you know nothing . 
  i do n't think that that was particularly patriotic . 
  because my comment is summarizing official government positions which there is no reason to believe false . 
  there was one one article from euroactiv listing `` anonymous sources '' . 
  the other media sources that have picked it up have been the sputnik/rt crowd , all of which simply cite euroactiv . 
  russia would stand to benefit from a turkey/us split , and even these sources that have been willing to take sketchy positions on mh17 ai n't willing to expend reputation doing anything other than reposting it . 
  romania stated that it was false and the us that there was no reason to believe that there was any risk to the weapons . 
  positioning of nuclear weapons has been a big political affair in the past , and there 's no reason to believe that this would change . 
  when i walk by the tabloid section in the supermarket , i do n't feel confused whether or not chelsea clinton was actually impregnated by the sasquatch , or whether aliens have abducted elvis . 
  similarly , when i read an speculative article -- the latter half of which has rebuttals attached -- based on an anonymous source about something politically implausible , and which conflicts with on-the-record material , the fact that rt and sputnik are linking to it does not throw me into a state of indecision over the reality of the situation . 
  or swedish women raping male turkish tourists !, 
  ... the bombs exist and are in turkey , where they always have been , and neither turkey nor the us has shown inclination to change that . 
  the [ new york air national guard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_york_air_national_guard ) 's ground-attack component , the [ 174th attack wing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/174th_attack_wing ) , operated manned aircraft for sixty years -- the [ f-86 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_f-86_sabre ) , the [ a-10 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fairchild_republic_a-10_thunderbolt_ii ) and the [ f-16 ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_dynamics_f-16_fighting_falcon ) -- finally moved to [ mq-9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mq-9_reaper ) s. cheaper to operate , no pilot at risk . 
  when the us fought japan in world war ii , japan [ ran out of trained pilots ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_japanese_navy_air_service ) :  the japanese pilot training program was very selective and rigorous , producing a high-quality and long-serving pilot corps , who ruled the air in the pacific during early world war ii . 
  however , the long duration of the training program , combined with a shortage of gasoline for training , did not allow the navy to rapidly provide qualified replacements in sufficient numbers . 
  moreover , the japanese , unlike the u.s. or britain , proved incapable of altering the program to speed up training of the recruits they got . 
  the resultant decrease in quantity and quality , among other factors , resulted in increasing casualties toward the end of the war . 
  http://www.historynet.com/japans-fatally-flawed-air-forces-in-world-war-ii-2.htm  by the end of 1943 , the army and navy had lost about 10,000 pilots . 
  as american lt. gen. george c. kenney reported to washington , `` japan 's originally highly trained crews were superb but they are dead . '' when matched to pilot production of 5,400 army and 5,000 navy in the same period , and when one considers the expansion in units , missions , tempo and geographical separation , it is clear that japan 's pilot strength had not increased at all . 
  worse , the vast majority of prewar and even 1942-43 veterans were dead or wounded , and their replacements had none of the veterans ' experience . 
  in the vietnam war , one of the tactical issues was that while the us had the overwhelming advantage in the air , rescue of a downed pilot handed over the iniative and forced engagement on much-less-favorable terms . 
  while search-and-rescue doctrine has improved since then , it 's still a weakness . 
  one example was the [ rescue of 21 bat bravo ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rescue_of_bat_21_bravo ) :  an early morning flight of two united states air force eb-66 aircraft was led by bat 20 , piloted by lt. col. robert singletary . 
  hambleton was a navigator aboard bat 21 . 
  the two aircraft were escorting a cell of three b-52s . 
  bat 21 was configured to gather signals intelligence , including identifying north vietnamese anti-aircraft radar installations to enable jamming . 
  bat 21 was destroyed by an sa-2 surface-to-air missile and hambleton was the only survivor , parachuting behind the front lines into a battlefield filled with thousands of north vietnamese army soldiers . 
  [ snip ]  the air force did not put limits on what it took to rescue a downed airman . 
  the direct and indirect cost of rescuing hambleton was enormous and became a watershed event in air force search and rescue . 
  to prevent friendly fire incidents , the americans imposed a standard no-fire zone within a 27 kilometres ( 17 mi ) radius of hambleton and diverted aircraft to aid in his rescue . 
  it is likely that south vietnamese soldiers indirectly died as a result of their inability to obtain fire support . 
  [ 3 ] :120 five additional aircraft were shot down during rescue attempts , directly resulting in the deaths of 11 airmen , the capture of two others , and another airman trying to evade capture . 
  this continues to be an issue for air forces today . 
  the syrian rebels had no ability to bring down high-flying russian aircraft bombing them . 
  however , once turkey [ shot down ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_russian_sukhoi_su-24_shootdown ) an aircraft , russian search-and-rescue teams were vulnerable :  two mil mi-8 helicopters were sent to find and recover the pilots from the crash site . 
  one of the helicopters was damaged by small-arms fire from syrian turkmen brigade militants , resulting in the death of a naval infantryman , and was forced to make an emergency landing . 
  [ 84 ] [ 85 ] all the surviving crew of the helicopter were rescued and evacuated later on . 
  [ 86 ] the free syrian army 's 1st coastal division claimed that they [ subsequently destroyed the abandoned helicopter using a us-made bgm-71 tow missile ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zonpgwvf9y ) . 
  using drones instead eliminates search-and-rescue weakness . 
  i should note , though , that while i 'm enthusiastic about the us moving to drones , i do n't know whether it makes sense from romania 's standpoint . 
  two major points : the eu does n't domestically produces the drones necessary -- though it does produce manned aircraft . 
  it may be desirable to have the ability to produce 'em onesself . 
  wikipedia says that the only current mq-9 competitor from the eu is the ( prototype phase ) [ bae mantis ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bae_systems_mantis ) ... and the uk may not be in the eu that much longer , so this may be something of a limitation to remedy if the eu wants independence from us arms manufacture . 
  second , i 'm a little suspicious that some us-produced arms purchases in europe are done with the intent of a * quid pro quo * for us military support . 
  it seems to me that this is an ineffective way of achieving that and would in any case be an unstable arrangement . 
  statements like trump 's are something that i 'd meet with diplomatic protest and a request for trump to be explicit about whether he 's honestly planning on breaking us commitments . 
  the use of tripwire us forces or other political arrangements seems likely to me to be more effective , though i 've no expertise on the matter .
