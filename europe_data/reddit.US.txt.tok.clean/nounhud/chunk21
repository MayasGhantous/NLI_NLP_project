  cutting off russia 's access to oil-drilling technology , to trade , and seriously damaging russia 's primary source of income will cause damage to all of russia , not just the russian soldiers that putin sends out to the front lines . 
  declaring open game on assets from oligarchs linked to putin means that that oh-so-valuable sense of secure wealth from supporting the government is no longer present . 
  it will not trash ukraine , at least not in the same way . 
  an out-and-out military conflict with russia will make it politically much-more-difficult for russia 's leadership to do what we 'd like , which is to walk away from ukraine , than it would be the case if it can simply be made to be very unappealing to stay . 
  i 'm not saying that military involvement in ukraine is necessarily a bad idea , but it would have consequences for many people and countries and i think that it 's very easy to see it as a quick-and-easy solution , which it is not . 
  i do n't think that that is a fair statement . 
  latvia is a small portion of nato . 
  the us is more-comparable to the eu , and us states to eu member countries . 
  saying `` latvia would n't make a huge difference alone if the us were being mauled '' is like saying `` nebraska alone would n't make a huge difference if the eu were in a struggle for survival '' . 
  does that statement , true or not , mean that you can extrapolate and say all the nebraskas do n't matter , because isolating one makes a limited difference ? 
  after all , an army is just made up of individual soldiers , and each individual soldier is unlikely to single-handedly turn the tide of a war ... now , that does n't invalidate the broader concern that that the thread was discussing that there 's a real , legitimate ( at least in my eyes ) concern that there 's a potential tragedy-of-the-commons situation associated with nato , where every one member thinks `` well , if * i * do n't make sure that i can contribute my share of military if called upon , that 's okay , because everyone else will '' . 
   national socialism is the only answer . 
  well , that escalated quickly . 
  http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_25468.htm  nato reiterates that in the current and foreseeable security environment , the alliance will carry out its collective defence and other missions by ensuring the necessary interoperability , integration , and capability for reinforcement rather than by additional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces . 
  accordingly , it will have to rely on adequate infrastructure commensurate with the above tasks . 
  in this context , reinforcement may take place , when necessary , in the event of defence against a threat of aggression and missions in support of peace consistent with the united nations charter and the osce governing principles , as well as for exercises consistent with the adapted cfe treaty , the provisions of the vienna document 1994 and mutually agreed transparency measures . 
  russia will exercise similar restraint in its conventional force deployments in europe . 
  we promised russia not to put `` substantial '' forces in in the `` current and foreseeable '' security environment . 
  now , maybe you can make a reasonable argument that two annexations of land from non-nato countries in the region in the last few years counts as a change in that security environment , but credibility is hard to buy . 
  it 'd definitely be preferable to have a clear-cut basis for doing something drastic . 
  the us can issue statements and have them believed only because it 's a history of conforming to them in the past . 
  violating one makes it harder for countries to be willing to trust that the us would conform in the future . 
  http://www.upi.com/top_news/world-news/2014/03/04/putin-no-russian-troops-in-crimea-and-no-plans-to-deploy-crimea-will-not-be-annexed/4461393943060/  russian president vladimir putin addressed reporters on tuesday regarding military intervention into ukraine , asserting that the armed groups occupying ukraine 's crimean peninsula are not russian soldiers but rather local , pro-russian `` self-defense '' forces . 
  putin asserted that russia has no intention of annexing crimea , and that any use of armed forces would require unspecified `` extreme circumstances . '', 
  [ snip ]  putin said it was `` unnecessary '' to deploy russian troops into ukraine , and asserted that the soldiers occupying crimea are not russian but rather local , pro-russian `` self-defense '' forces . 
  the uniforms , he acknowledged , may resemble russian uniforms but he explained that former soviet countries had similar uniforms readily available for purchase in stores . 
  [ snip ]  on saturday , putin requested and received approval from the federation council to use force in ukraine . 
  he described the request as `` a humanitarian mission '' to ukraine , with which it has `` fraternal ties . '', 
    putin maintained that russia has no intention of annexing ukraine 's mostly pro-russian crimea region . 
    he also objected to criticism levied by the u.s. and many european leaders for `` the presence of unidentified forces in ukraine '' that were construed as russian forces , and said that retributive actions such as sanctions against russia would be mutually harmful . 
  -- march 4 , 2014 mind , that 's translated excerpts , not the original russian ; you may want to dig up someone who knows russian to find content in the original . 
  well , to be fair , the state * was * backing them , refusing to turn them over , and providing a base for training up folks to do more attacks . 
  article 5 was n't invoked until afghanistan said that they would neither turn the responsible parties over nor permit the us to come in and get them , at which point there is n't really going to be a solution that does n't involve bringing down afghanistan one way or another . 
  most countries would be pretty irked at having a state support attacks on their biggest commercial center , their military headquarters , and either their legislative or executive headquarters ( wherever flight 93 was going ) . 
  the us has n't had anything hit the country like that since world war ii . 
  true , the mechanism was a bit unusual , but the practical effect was not terribly strange . 
  to be fair , what the us probably was most interested in there was political buy-in . 
  we prefer the term `` well-prepared for famine '' . 
  `` gr '' instead of `` de '' for germany ? 
  edit : and from zbigniew brzezinski ? 
  i kind of think that each side is actually complaining about one side somehow `` running '' things because it makes a more-acceptable argument . 
  i think that if the positions of the two were swapped , you would n't have the same people complaining any more ( i.e. 
  if germany and france said `` okay , no ukraine in '' and the current dutch government started insisting that ukraine be let in ) that people arguing for disproportionate influence on each side of things would stop complaining . 
  if true , that means that it 's just a proxy for the real concerns ( which might be less-politically-correct ) . 
  ditto for `` democratic deficit '' -- while i realize that there might be people concerned about the abstract structure of the eu , i suspect that a lot more people are concerned about policies passing that they personally do n't like . 
  ditto for complaints about , say , treatment of lgbt people by middle easterners -- not that there are n't * some * people for whom this is a real concern , but i rather suspect that it 's more that it 's a politically-correct argument that can be a proxy for the real concerns . 
  something like this , and there are things from all sides of the equation here : | said | actually meant | | - | - | | i am concerned about the impact on gay rights in the eu from muslim immigration . | i do n't want competition for resources , or cultural shift in areas that personally impact me , or loss of relative political power in a democracy . | | i am concerned about the democratic deficit in the eu . | i dislike the current policy that was just adopted by the eu . | | country x in the eu should n't be running things . | i do n't like policy y that country x in the eu is adopting . | | i am concerned about the rise of extremist views and their potential for creating violence . | i want ideas that i politically-disagree with suppressed . | | much as it pains me to do so , we must do what is necessary to prevent another stalin-style communist takeover . | i want ideas that i politically-disagree with suppressed . | | much as it pains me to do so , we must do what is necessary to prevent another hitler-style fascist takeover . | i want ideas that i politically-disagree with suppressed . | | if we do n't adopt policy x , we risk the far-right coming to power , and that would be catastrophic . | i want my favored policy x adopted . | | voting scheme x is undemocratic . | voting scheme x led to a policy that i find undesirable . | | i 'd love to help people who are suffering from war , but we simply do n't have the resources . | i do not want to expend the resources to provide aid ; it 's doubtful that it will be as cheap as claimed or permanently-resolve anything , and i doubt that those recipients would similarly extend help to me if i were in a similarly-bad-place . | | political leader x suffers from character failings and is unfit for his position . | i do n't like political leader x 's policies . | while some of that is unavoidable , it makes it kind of hard to get at the meat of the matter , what 's actually bothering people , when you 've got blankets of not-really-meaningful arguments masking the real dispute . 
  well , i mean , the term `` pull factor '' is just being used to refer to things that create an incentive to come over , that create a `` pull '' that people will want to follow . 
  that 'd be in opposition to changes that would n't change people 's desire to come over . 
  could be pretty disconnected from whether-or-not there 's an absolute change in germany . 
  think of the following cases : * redistribution from germany to the uk . 
  assuming that a migrant heading to germany considers the uk a substitute of exactly equal value ( dubious , but let 's say that that 's the case ) , this would create an absolute reduction in the number of current illegal migrants in germany , but have no effect on pull factor -- after all , anyone coming to germany illegally would be getting to either london or berlin . 
  * merkel 's trade-people-present-illegally-for-someone-coming-over-legally . 
  this does nothing to reduce the absolute number of migrants in germany , but assuming that germany can pretty-reliably arrest illegal immigrants , it kills the pull factor . 
  people do n't want to be paying smugglers to effectively smuggle some random person in syria in -- they want to be smuggled in * themselves * . 
  the difference it would try to create would be between how many people there would be in germany compared to how many would have shown up n months down the road without this policy in place . 
  whatever it is that germans like , the [ dutch are selling them a lot of it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_germany ) . 
  automating construction would open up a lot of opportunities -- that 's very labor intensive . 
  i think that the idea of a robot that can self-deploy off a truck , and construct a house with just raw materials being brought in is long-term viable , but what i 've seen people * actually * manage is a fair way from that . 
  not really practical yet . 
  also , i dunno about manufacturing . 
  i understand where people are coming from , but ... automation has high fixed costs and but low marginal costs . 
  it makes more sense the larger the scale of something . 
  if you 're producing millions of automobiles , it might make a lot of sense to spend a lot on automation . 
  if you 're producing a thousand or ten thousand of something , it might not , at least in the near future . 
  i would more expect a slow , drawn out decrease in manufacturing labor , not a rapid collapse of the sort that truck drivers might hit . 
  and a change in what it * means * to work in manufacturing -- a modern farmer probably is n't spending most of his time digging post holes with an old-style shovel , but we still call him a farmer . 
   i would not call this ` eliminating pull factors ' however . 
  why not ? 
  it uses the same mechanism that chancellor merkel was aiming to use with the turkey deal , yes ? 
  `` i could spend money to come over illegally , but it would n't work out because i 'd probably be caught and someone else would just get my spot . '', 
   as an american , this blows me away ... i just ca n't imagine our government conducting raids based on opinions they consider `` hate speech '' . 
  well , there is no crime of hate speech in the us . 
  there is a class of [ hate crimes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_crime_laws_in_the_united_states ) in the us , but that involves generally doing things that would already have been illegal -- like , someone could say `` gay people are all a bunch of jackasses and should be tossed out of society '' , and it 'd be protected free speech , but if they assaulted someone who was gay * because that person was gay * , they could be subject to higher penalties that would otherwise be the case . 
   unlike france and belgium , germany can not use its armed forces to increase readiness domestically because of constitutional prohibitions , ernst g. walter , chairman of the federal police union ( dpoig ) , told cbs news in berlin . 
  realistically , how effective is the military in terms of securing a country 's general civilian infrastructure against terrorism ? 
  * the main use that i can think of would be if you * knew * that something would be a target in advance so that in the event of something like a shooting , they could respond more-quickly ... but there just are n't enough people in the military to place them everywhere that might be a target . 
  * because they 're visible , they 're avoidable in choosing a target . 
  you do n't choose the guarded targets ... * similarly , some types of attack are hard to respond to and could be used instead . 
  a bombing is n't something that a faster response time is going to buy much on . 
  * i would imagine that all european countries already have some sort of armed police that can respond to any situation where throwing police in might help . 
  more might decrease response time , but it 's not as if they 're outgunned and require military aid . 
  i 'd think that things like domestic monitoring , intelligence efforts , gathering identity information and checking it against other sources of data , and adjusting law enforcement policy would be more meaningful than doing things with the military . 
  that 's not to say that it * hurts * to have a bunch of people available , and maybe they could help in rescue work in the event of an attack . 
  one high-profile case that i can think of where this helped was where a [ major air crash occurred right where a us state national guard was doing their monthly day of training ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_airlines_flight_232#factors_contributing_to_survival_rate ) , which meant that about three hundred people could be immediately pulled in to help survivors . 
  but i 'm not sure that that 's exactly what the author is hoping for . 
  that would n't stop an attack . 
  and it does n't seem like the most-effective use of funds . 
  maybe automated gunshot or explosion locators , to further reduce response time . 
   `` we have very old weapons in the german police force . 
  the machine guns are the machine pistol mp5 -- it 's about 50 years old , '' he said , referring to the 9mm submachine guns made by germany 's own heckler & koch since the 1960s . 
  at least thus far , people wearing body armor has n't really been a concern ... it 's not totally clear to me how newer or more-powerful submachine guns would help a whole lot . 
   new york city police deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism john miller told cbs news that thousands of police officers already wear radiation detectors . 
    `` we also have fixed detectors spread throughout the city , '' said miller . 
  `` all of this rings into a central control center where it shows up on maps that are linked to 8,000 cameras and license plate readers . '', 
  i 'm not saying that it is n't a theoretical concern , but dirty bombs have n't shown up as a reality yet . 
  ya , i know . 
  not all countries structure things that way . 
  iirc , from memory , some of the uk 's overseas territories , like those of denmark , are not part of the eu , but at least some of france 's overseas territories ( including , say , some of south america ) * are * part of the eu . 
  what a country does with citizenship is also up to it .
