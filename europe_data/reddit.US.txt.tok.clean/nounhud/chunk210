  edit : oh , wait ... this is the predator , not the reaper . 
  still , the only eu-manufactured predator competitor listed on wp is the [ harfang ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/eads_harfang ) , which is apparently being replaced by the reaper anyway , so the comment still stands ... 
  hmmm . 
  the text reads `` canada '' . 
  you already have free movement and labor . 
  if anything starts the melting pot going , that 's gon na be it . 
  i do n't see why federalization would produce that . 
  rather , i 'd expect it to be a consequence of that . 
   ever since that we 've only had members leave , further devolution , and inequality between the member countries in various aspects so ... what if * you * federalized ? 
  the complaints seem to be `` we do n't like westminster domestic policy -- too right wing -- right ? 
  that 'd let them go do their thing . 
  hell , the reason the us seceded from the british empire was because federalization was n't on offer . 
  if the colonies had n't been colonies , but federal states , neither of the two primary complaints ( ca n't expand westward because of the london trying to reserve access for itself and taxation without representation ) would have existed . 
  it 's hard to imagine what canada would be like if the us just vanished , because their economy is so tied up with ours . 
  however , if you assume no economic change , they 're similar in wealth to the uk , half the population , much lower level of military spending . 
  the economy is between italy and spain in size . 
  it 's not something to sneeze at . 
  trump has a much better shot than corbyn , and i would n't bet much on trump . 
  ehhh ... i doubt it . 
  he 's a left-wing pacifist . 
  i do n't care for his positions , but dumping the falklands , for example , does n't benefit russia . 
  i think of him more as a left-wing british ron paul -- an idealist who is willing to say a lot of politically-incorrect things and wants to greatly reduce international involvement . 
  russia and chinese broadcasters were both enthusiastic about paul . 
  that is in a number of ways what i expect russia would want , but i do n't think that there 's any reason to believe that he 's doing anything underhanded . 
  i have seen past whackjob conspiracy theories where people start listing all the people who have died . 
  it does n't seem to be that uncommon . 
  * clinton friends who died : http://lidblog.com/47-dead-clinton-friends-pt1/ * whistleblower dearhs associated with 9/11 : https://usahitman.com/wbdct911/ * jfk assassination deaths debunk : http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/deaths.htm general discussion of the ` mysterious death ' phenomenon : https://skeptoid.com/blog/2013/07/08/death-by-mysterious-circumstances/, 
  my usual objection that 'd be a lot bloodier than known false flags . 
  i 'm not familiar with the history of the event , but i 'd want to be on very firm footing before making such an accusation , as it 's not in line with what 's been seen in the past . 
  i thought that the debunking-mh17-myths crowd was beating a dead horse . 
  apparently mh17 myths are still a thing . 
  what the imf complainants wanted would have been to not get involved at all , that greece was not in the class of problems that the imf is supposed to deal with . 
  that would n't have really made varoufakis happy either , as i understand it -- his interest is in having someone other than greece pay down a bunch of that debt . 
   `` we want serbia to become an eu member , but we also want to join with our fundamental rights : to have romanian schools , liturgy in romanian , and romanian press , '' said predrag balasevic , vice president of `` ariadne filum '' - a cultural association of romanians and vlachs in serbia . 
  romanian-language publications are illegal in serbia ? 
   this whole situation really irritates me , especially with the general eu tone toward greece and their debt issue before . 
  it 's only the ` good ' and average greek people suffering from all this , the oligarch and politician still laughing all the way to the bank . 
  well , let 's put it this way . 
  the eu is not an abstract entity . 
  it 's you . 
  are you willing to vote for a tax to pay down that greek debt ? 
  that is , are you personally willing to take a hit ? 
  because anyone could do that . 
  the us could do it , just as you could , and i note that we ai n't sending money over . 
  `` debt forgiveness '' sounds pleasantly disconnected from cost , but it 's asking germans and french and the like to cover the losses . 
  in practice , my guess is that there will be further forgiveness , but that it 'll be incremental and conditional on reforms to stop the processes that led to this in the first place . 
   - first of all , 500 of today 's tech nuclear bombs can easily clear earth of life no , they ca n't . 
  [ this simulates nuclear weapon damage ] ( http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/ ) . 
  the largest nuclear weapon ever built was a 50mt yield soviet weapon , what we called `` tsar bomba '' , bomb . 
  [ here 's the effects of hitting london ] ( http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&amp;kt=50000&amp;lat=51.499167&amp;lng=-0.124722&amp;hob_opt=2&amp;hob_psi=5&amp;hob_ft=13000&amp;ff=3&amp;zm=8 ) . 
  that 'd kill a lot of people , but zoom out and you realize that 500 of even those is n't enough to kill off even all the people in europe , much less all * life * . 
  and there are n't 500 of those -- only one was ever made . 
  the most-common us nuclear warhead is the w-76 , which has a yield of only 100kt , or 1/500th as large . 
  [ setting off one of those over central moscow would n't even kill most of the humans in moscow ] ( http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&amp;kt=100&amp;lat=55.751667&amp;lng=37.617778&amp;hob_opt=1&amp;hob_psi=5&amp;hob_ft=4755&amp;ff=50&amp;zm=12 ) . 
  nuclear war with present arsenals could screw up human civilization , but it would not wipe out all humanity , even if all weapons were specifically used with that goal in mind . 
  they definitely would not wipe out all life . 
  for more perspective -- there have been five [ extinction events ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extinction_event ) on earth , none of which ( obviously ) managed to kill off all life , though they did knock out a lot . 
  the [ k-t extinction event ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cretaceous%e2%80%93paleogene_extinction_event ) some 66 million years ago was a comet impact with the energy of two million 50mt tsar bombas set off simultaneously , and that was n't even the greatest of earth 's extinction events ... and none of * those * have been able to wipe out life on earth . 
   you ca n't build more missile bases in romania and south korea saying they 're for safety those launch interceptor missiles , not ballistic missiles . 
  they stop nuclear weapons , they are n't themselves throwing nuclear weapons . 
  hell , the battery in romania is iirc thaad , which does n't even have conventional explosives onboard , much less nuclear -- it rams directly into the incoming nuclear weapon and destroys it with the force of its movement . 
  i can understand why russia would n't like that -- it 's a move towards neutralizing their land-based icbms , even if the number of interceptors out there is far too small to come close to neutralizing the arsenal today -- but it 's not something that can be directly used to attack in any meaningful way . 
   dude also oversaw an unnilateral leave of usa from the nuclear pact with russia [ bush withdrew ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-ballistic_missile_treaty#us_withdrawal ) . 
  the abm treaty provides for withdrawal . 
   he oversaw the rise of black lives matter ... kind of irrelevant ? 
  not exactly politically-significant , either . 
   he also made healthcare more or less unaffordable without an ... unnafordable insurance . 
  ... even if you do n't like obama 's healthcare policy ( i do n't and am not particularly enthusiastic about increasing state subsidies either ) , it 's tough to argue that adding subsidized insurance makes healthcare * less * unaffordable . 
  and i do n't see what it has to do with the nobel , in any event . 
  hmm . 
  none of those little loop things , though ... 
  one of the most-unusual and distinctive scripts , imho . 
  at some point , if the eu 's non-nato security guarantees are to avoid the free rider problem that public goods face , the eu will either need to impose an `` eu military tax '' or to at least mandate minimum military capabilities . 
  http://www.econlib.org/library/enc/defense.html  national defense , like other public goods , has an important `` free-rider '' problem . 
  that is , because people benefit whether or not they contribute toward defense , each person has an incentive to wait for others to provide the collective defense good , and thus hopes to get a `` free ride . '' also , because a free rider 's consumption does not reduce the amount of defense available for others to consume , even those who pay have little incentive to prevent free riding by others . 
    as a result of such free riding , individuals acting privately to provide national defense services would produce too little from the standpoint of society as a whole . 
  each person would provide defense until the incremental benefits to him equaled the incremental costs . 
  but for society as a whole -- that is , for all individuals collectively -- the incremental benefits would exceed the incremental costs , precisely because once an individual provides some of the collective good , all people benefit from it and no one can be excluded . 
  this free-rider behavior yields one of the important traditional arguments for government : by imposing taxes on all individuals and then providing collective goods , government , in principle , can eliminate freerider behavior and produce the `` correct '' amount of national defense and other collective goods . 
   pressure and cajoling freedom fries in the senate cafeteria !, 
   also what do more tanks and more aircraft do when the bundeswehr ca n't hire enough personel to man them ? 
  hmm . 
  is n't that equivalent to saying that it does n't have the necessary budget to provide the compensation to attract the people that it needs ? 
   i say we do n't move until the ireland , netherlands and luxemburg start making serious military contributions from their budget . 
  is the security of your eastern members an effective bargaining chip to sell those three countries on something ? 
  well , actually there was such a reason : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_male_circumcision#masturbation_concerns  circumcision in english-speaking countries arose in a climate of negative attitudes towards sex , especially concerning masturbation . 
  in her 1978 article the ritual of circumcision , [ 57 ] karen erickson paige writes : `` the current medical rationale for circumcision developed after the operation was in wide practice . 
  the original reason for the surgical removal of the foreskin , or prepuce , was to control ` masturbatory insanity ' -- the range of mental disorders that people believed were caused by the ` polluting ' practice of ` self-abuse . ' '', 
    `` self-abuse '' was a term commonly used to describe masturbation in the 19th century . 
  according to paige , `` treatments ranged from diet , moral exhortations , hydrotherapy , and marriage , to such drastic measures as surgery , physical restraints , frights , and punishment . 
  some doctors recommended covering the penis with plaster of paris , leather , or rubber ; cauterization ; making boys wear chastity belts or spiked rings ; and in extreme cases , castration . '', 
  paige details how circumcision became popular as a masturbation remedy :    in the 1890s , it became a popular technique to prevent , or cure , masturbatory insanity . 
  in 1891 the president of the royal college of surgeons of england published on circumcision as preventive of masturbation , and two years later another british doctor wrotecircumcision : its advantages and how to perform it , which listed the reasons for removing the `` vestigial '' prepuce . 
  evidently the foreskin could cause `` nocturnal incontinence , '' hysteria , epilepsy , and irritation that might `` give rise to erotic stimulation and , consequently , masturbation . '', 
  another physician , p.c. 
  remondino , added that `` circumcision is like a substantial and well-secured life annuity ... it insures better health , greater capacity for labor , longer life , less nervousness , sickness , loss of time , and less doctor bills . '', 
  no wonder it became a popular remedy . 
  [ 57 ]   at the same time circumcisions were advocated on men , clitoridectomies ( removal of the clitoris ) were also performed for the same reason ( to treat female masturbators ) . 
  the us `` orificial surgery society '' for female `` circumcision '' operated until 1925 , and clitoridectomies and infibulations would continue to be advocated by some through the 1930s . 
  as late as 1936 , l. e. holt , an author of pediatric textbooks , advocated male and female circumcision as a treatment for masturbation .
