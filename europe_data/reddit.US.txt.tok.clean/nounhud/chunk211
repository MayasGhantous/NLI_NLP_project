  [ 57 ]   one of the leading advocates of circumcision was john harvey kellogg . 
  he advocated the consumption of kellogg 's corn flakes to prevent masturbation , and he believed that circumcision would be an effective way to eliminate masturbation in males . 
     covering the organs with a cage has been practiced with entire success . 
  a remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision , especially when there is any degree of phimosis . 
  the operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic , as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind , especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment , as it may well be in some cases . 
  the soreness which continues for several weeks interrupts the practice , and if it had not previously become too firmly fixed , it may be forgotten and not resumed . 
  if any attempt is made to watch the child , he should be so carefully surrounded by vigilance that he can not possibly transgress without detection . 
  if he is only partially watched , he soon learns to elude observation , and thus the effect is only to make him cunning in his vice . 
    robert darby ( 2003 ) , writing in the medical journal of australia , noted that some 19th-century circumcision advocates -- and their opponents -- believed that the foreskin was sexually sensitive :    in the 19th century the role of the foreskin in erotic sensation was well understood by physicians who wanted to cut it off precisely because they considered it the major factor leading boys to masturbation . 
  the victorian physician and venereologist william acton ( 1814 -- 1875 ) damned it as `` a source of serious mischief '' , and most of his contemporaries concurred . 
  both opponents and supporters of circumcision agreed that the significant role the foreskin played in sexual response was the main reason why it should be either left in place or removed . 
  william hammond , a professor of mind in new york in the late 19th century , commented that `` circumcision , when performed in early life , generally lessens the voluptuous sensations of sexual intercourse '' , and both he and acton considered the foreskin necessary for optimal sexual function , especially in old age . 
  jonathan hutchinson , english surgeon and pathologist ( 1828 -- 1913 ) , and many others , thought this was the main reason why it should be excised . 
  [ 9 ]   born in the united kingdom during the late-nineteenth century , john maynard keynes and his brother geoffrey , were both circumcised in boyhood due to parents ' concern about their masturbatory habits . 
  [ 60 ] mainstream pediatric manuals continued to recommend circumcision as a deterrent against masturbation until the 1950s . 
  given present low fertility levels , i do n't think that russia needs more policies to try to make sex more joyless .

   paying actors to reenact `` news '' is quite common these days . 
  are you talking about a legit , labeled re-enactment , where they say `` in this re-enactment , you can see how ... '' or just totally made-up stuff ? 
  < thinks  the [ dateline nbc false explosion scandal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dateline_nbc#general_motors_vs._nbc ) , which is the closest thing i can think of over here , did make headlines :  general motors vs. nbc [ edit ]   * further information : [ chevrolet c/k \u00a7 sidesaddle fuel tank controversy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chevrolet_c/k#sidesaddle_fuel_tank_controversy ) *   on november 17 , 1992 , dateline nbc aired an hour-long investigative report titled `` waiting to explode , '' which focused on allegations that general motors ' rounded-line chevrolet c/k-series pickup trucks exploded upon impact when involved in collisions due to the poor design of the vehicle model 's fuel tanks . 
  dateline 's footage showed a sample of a low-speed accident in which the fuel tank exploded ; the explosion during the crash test would later be discovered to have been rigged by producers with the program , who placed remotely controlled model rocket engines inside the truck 's fuel tank to initiate the blast . 
  [ citation needed ] the program did not disclose the fact that the accident was staged . 
  [ citation needed ]   gm hired investigators from failure analysis associates ( faaa , now exponent ) to study the footage ; faaa investigators discovered while reviewing the video that smoke had actually started to expel from the fuel tank six frames before the actual impact occurred . 
  acting on a tip from someone involved with the dateline crash test , investigators with faaa searched through 22 junkyards in indiana before finding the charred wreckage of the gm pickups . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   it was also later revealed that the dateline report had been dishonest about the fuel tanks rupturing and the alleged 30 miles per hour ( 48 km/h ) speed at which the collision was conducted . 
  the actual speed was found to be higher than stated , around 40 miles per hour ( 64 km/h ) , and after x-ray examination of the fuel tanks from the c/k pickups used in the televised collision , it was found that they had not ruptured and were intact . 
  [ 4 ] [ 5 ] gm subsequently filed an anti-defamation/libel lawsuit against nbc after conducting an extensive investigation . 
  on february 8 , 1993 , gm conducted a highly publicized point-by-point rebuttal in the product exhibit hall of the general motors building in detroit that lasted nearly two hours after announcing the lawsuit . 
  [ 6 ] the lawsuit was settled the same week by nbc , and [ jane pauley read a 3 1/2 minute on-air apology to viewers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktpmzgn9uwc ) . 
    the general motors lawsuit and the subsequent settlement were arguably the most devastating blows for nbc in a series of reputation damaging incidents during the 1990s and early 2000s . 
  within nbc , michael gartner , who resigned under pressure shortly after the incident , was the source for much of the blame . 
  nbc news president reuven frank stated gartner was hired in 1988 , despite having no background in television news , in an attempt to satisfy parent company general electric , by replacing current journalists with cheaper , less experienced reporters and producers . 
  [ 7 ]   in addition to the resignation of the news division 's president gartner , three dateline nbc producers were dismissed as a result of the incident and the findings of the resulting investigation : executive producer jeff diamond , senior producer david rummel , and robert read , producer of the report on the pickups . 
  michele gillen , the correspondent involved in the segment , was transferred to nbc 's miami owned-and-operated station wtvj , where she became an anchor of the station 's evening newscasts . 
  on the other hand , my guess is that romania has less visibility here than gm , so ... i dunno . 
  there will always be financial crises in the future -- but also recoveries . 
  the sweden-denmark rivalry . 
   but is it the policies of denmark that we should admire , or is there something special about being danish ? 
  a closer look at the evidence shows a more complex picture and one actually pretty favorable to the american way .

  yeah , i 'm quite certain that the council of europe would not be cooperative . 
  some people opposed to it -- i assume farmers or someone else who will lose out -- has been claiming that isds in ttip will let the nhs be ended . 
  i 'd take this as fairly compelling evidence that they were n't able to dig up any real objections that would go over well ... 
  this is not a credible risk , and afaict the party flogging the idea that it is is rt and the usual constellation of associated sites , presumably to try to drive a wedge in .

  well , to be fair , some folks on here from the us took the google fines personally , so it may be kinda a universal response . 
  the `` you '' here would be the lawyers and the first plaintiff initially kicking off the suit , not the bulk of people out there , though . 
  that is , you need one person in the class who wants to kick it off . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loaded_question  the traditional example is the question `` have you stopped beating your wife ? '', 
  whether the respondent answers yes or no , they will admit to having a wife and having beaten her at some time in the past . 
  thus , these facts are presupposed by the question , and in this case an entrapment , because it narrows the respondent to a single answer , and the fallacy of many questions has been committed . 
  he used the term , which i clearly understood to mean `` camps in poland '' . 
  what i 'm asking is whether there is a real contingent of people who have misinterpreted this . 
   poles fear that as the war grows more distant younger generations will incorrectly assume that poles had a role in the death camp . 
  ... is this an actual problem ? 
  have people been running around confused on the matter thus far ? 
  or is this just preempting the possibility that it * might * happen ? 
  the lawyers on this suit are n't going to be working for an up-front fee , but for a cut of the take . 
  there wo n't be any fee that 's visible to the injured party -- just a card that shows up in the mail asking if they 're willing to be part of the class-action suit . 
  if the lawyers lose , there wo n't be any legal fees that they pay . 
   despite what you may have been told in the german press , or on reddit , our environmental laws are very strict , with statutory penalties . 
  iirc , there are some types of emissions where europe is more restrictive on emissions than we are . 
  it 's not like there 's some sort of single emissions toughness level . 
  fosters advertisements played here . 
  `` foster 's -- australian for beer . '', 
  common misconception . 
  we 've mostly moved to the m4 .
