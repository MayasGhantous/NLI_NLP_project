   meanwhile , other markets like california , which is considered a pioneer in introducing a zero-emission vehicle mandate , only aims for 15 % of car sales to be zero-emission vehicles by 2025 -- a target tesla ceo elon musk recently referred to as `` pathetically low '' .

   is it wrong to preserve one of western civilizations greatest prevailing traditions - the showcase of a woman 's beauty ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_swimwear  swimming and outdoor bathing were discouraged in the christian west and there was little need for a bathing or swimming costume till the 18th century . 
  the bathing gown in the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve chemise-type gown made of wool or flannel , so that modesty or decency was not threatened . 
  [ 1 ] in the first half of the 19th century the top became knee-length while an ankle-length drawer was added as a bottom . 
  that 's a lot more conservative than a burkini .

  taxation would wipe out that money quickly . 
  the taxes that those people pay funds a higher level of services than would otherwise be the case .

  i 've a relative in the us who drives a diesel mercedes . 
  i think that there is a strong argument that the harmed person should n't be the one to get punitive damage payouts , though . 
  well , the `` we wo n't allow them on the road in the us '' is what * makes * them worthless , yes ? 
  if the eu is okay with that level of emissions and lets them continue to be operated , the owner is suffering a much-smaller loss : he 's not being deprived of his automobile , just some efficiency or power . 
  hmm . 
  diesel cars also get more miles to the gallon , though . 
  you sure that that does n't compensate ? 
  not that the us auto industry has n't managed to pull us political strings in the past : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken_tax  with johnson 's proclamation , [ 4 ] the u.s. had invoked its right under the general agreement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) , [ 11 ] whereby an offended nation may increase tariffs by an equal amount to losses from discriminating tariffs . 
  officially , the tax targeted items imported from europe approximating the value of lost american chicken sales to europe . 
  [ 14 ]   in retrospect , audio tapes from the johnson white house , revealed a quid pro quo unrelated to chicken . 
  in january 1964 , president johnson attempted to convince united auto workers ' president walter reuther not to initiate a strike just before the 1964 election and to support the president 's civil rights platform . 
  reuther in turn wanted johnson to respond to volkswagen 's increased shipments to the united states . 
  [ 14 ]   the chicken tax directly curtailed importation of german-built volkswagen vans in configurations that qualified them as light trucks , that is , commercial vans and pickups . 
  [ 14 ] still hoping that ttip will eliminate said chicken tax . 
  aside from differences in punitive damages , it 's worth noting that [ common law ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_law ) systems ( uk , us , ex-british empire ) tend not to require [ specific performance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/specific_performance ) . 
  the norm there is to assess damages and have a cash payout . 
  [ civil law ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_law_\\ ( legal_system \\ ) ) , the system in continental europe , tends to require that the original contract be fulfilled . 
  not sure if that 's relevant in terms of the differences in the legal outcome between the eu and the us here , but ...

   people do n't like companies , which the employees do n't have say in , to be able to use their money for political purposes . 
  this differs from unions in the fact that unions get to choose their leadership and where they spend money and companies do n't . 
  are you sure that you do n't mean '' * you * do n't like '' ? 
  i 've no objection to companies running their ad campaigns . 
   people dont like the protections that companies get in the sense that you ca n't kill a company or imprision the people running it like you can a person who does the same thing ( like intentional neglegince leading to deaths ) . 
  managers of companies do n't get immunity for their personal actions . 
   it 'll never get the self-loathing of these extreme left types . 
  long article , but i highly recommend it -- i think that it 's rather insightful . 
  [ i can tolerate anything except the outgroup ] ( http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/ ), 
  the sexting situation is still new , so it has some odd loopholes . 
  and you only hear about the most egregious examples . 
  the [ copening case in north carolina is another fun example ] ( http://www.fayobserver.com/news/local/fayetteville-teen-facing-felony-charges-in-sexting-case-agrees-to/article_f8c8e156-9660-57b4-a2b8-b65a6bd8bbb2.html ) . 
  a seventeen-year-old male and sixteen-year-old female were charged with multiple counts of sexual exploitation of a minor for sexting each other . 
  for the male 's charges , the partner was the victim for one charge and himself the victim for four other charges , since it 's possible in north carolina to be both the victim and the perpetrator . 
  better -- north carolina treats 16 as being the age at which teens may be charged as adults ( younger than the age at which one stops being a victim ) . 
  so felony charges as an adult for committing sexual exploitation of a minor -- themselves . 
  further , it would have been legal for the two to have sex with each other , since they were over the age of consent -- just not to take explicit pictures of themselves . 
  we would n't normally know their names , since normally us newspapers have the convention of not publishing the names of victims of sex crimes ... but because newspapers do publish the names of those subject to adult felony charges , and giving up the name of a perpetrator who has committed crimes against himself kinda gives away the name of the victim as well , they did publish the guy 's name . 
  he apparently cut a plea deal and pled guilty to multiple misdemeanors and the state agreed to drop the felony charges . 
  i do n't know if it would be considered equivalent to a false bomb threat , but if it was : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/threatening_terrorism_against_the_united_states wikipedia says multiple federal crimes punishable by up to ten and five years in prison . 
  those sentences might run concurrently , though . 
  just out of curiosity , have you seen [ the main page of rense.com ] ( http://www.rense.com/ ) or have [ any familiarity with the guy that runs it ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jeff_rense ) ? 
    meanwhile we 're one of the few countries to actually send troops to eastern europe . 
    name something consequential that was ever a confrontational position against russia . 
  what 's your preferred route ? 
  most countries have old people . 
  unless your emigration plan is to sealand or similar , the best you 'll get is a low average age , not no old people . 
  [ countries that do that tend to have high birthrates and high mortality . 
  basically , sub-saharan africa .

   * have locked down all positions of power and wo n't let go at all does this differ from other generations ? 
   * are the most important voting block especially in ageing societies , so all politics pander to them differ from other generations ? 
  the us normally ranges from 16 to 18 , but romeo and juliet laws permit for select circumstances where younger ages are permissable as long as the ages of the two are close . 
  wikipedia has some [ entertaining examples ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_the_united_states ) . 
  in connecticut , for example , a 13-year-old may consent as long as the partner is within three years of age . 
  additionally , minors in connecticut below 13 may use their age as an affirmative defense as long as the age is within two years . 
  this does create some odd situations where a 10-year-old and a 12-year-old may have sex without fear of punishment , where they may again do so a year later without risk , where the next year the older of the two would be committing a felony ( automatic trial as an adult , mandatory minimum of 5 years imprisonment ) . 
  wait one more year after that , however , and the couple could have sex legally . 
  also , while under some circumstances i recall that us immigration law permits marriages at a young age to be imported , only some states appear to permit marriage to be a defense against statutory rape ( e.g. 
  arizona ) . 
  `` elite '' is loaded with emotional content and is distressingly ambiguous . 
  what is an `` elite '' ? 
  a politician ? 
  a scientist ? 
  a priest ? 
  a professional sports figure ( probably meeting some degree of success ) ? 
  someone who is wealthy ( to some degree of wealth ) ? 
  someone who is the brother-in-law of an influential politician ? 
  some administrator in a bureaucracy ? 
  a notable diplomat ? 
  that is covered by disability ( which , in the us , is already subject to fraud problems . . and i imagine that the same is true in europe ) . 
  if you want more extensive disability , that 's be a different arguement . 
  nobody is , as far as i know , prevented by the government from working past retirement age . 
  i assume that , like in the us , retirement age is just the point where someone can draw their full pension without penalty .
