  i mean , i could n't give you a definition of that term . 
  i get that the author is objecting to use of the term as granting some form of reputability , but it 's not clear to me what claim is even being made or whether `` alternative news '' , whatever it is , should be expected to meet some sort of standard for reputability . 
  how is it posturing ? 
  they were offered something -- visa-free access -- that i think many people , including myself , suspect was not a good-faith offer . 
  i do n't think that it 's unrealistic to expect them to kill the deal . 
  a `` here are the black and white terms , and if you are n't onboard , deal is off '' does resolve that ambiguity . 
  i personally think that turkey could probably get a more-favorable deal than completely killing the thing , but i would n't expect them to get offered a eu fast-track or visa-free access or whatever and then not have delivery and simply ignore that and deliver on their side of the arrangement . 
    high real estate prices   literally the same issues every eu country faces . 
  [ denmark , as of 2014 , was actually pretty much in line with historic housing prices ] ( https://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/focusonhouseprices.htm ) as price-to-income-ratio goes . 
  it 's interesting to note the correlation between price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios in the oecd in this table . 
  not only are they strongly-correlated , but price-to-rent ratio is more volatile than price-to-income . 
  that would suggest to me that renting would tend to be a good idea -- that this is people bent on buying , perhaps in the belief that this is a good long-term investment -- driving up costs . 
  i 'm no expert in it -- just chose it as a convenient example , since ipa is unreasonable for general use and too complicated for me , and they 've already a phonetic dictionary -- but the only character that saypyu introduces is the schwa , which is already commonly used in english dictionary pronunciation guides , and additionally they provide for use of an asterisk in place of the schwa . 
  my guess is that if it was n't already in use for this sound , they would have used some vaguely-phonic existing combination of english letters . 
  that lets a standard english keyboard be used . 
  ( for those curious : [ it looks like ] ( http://www.saypyu.com/use.php ) `` dh '' is used to indicate a hard `` th '' , and `` th '' used to indicate a soft `` th '' . ), 
  there is no restriction in the lease on operating a detention facility at that naval base , nor is anyone credibly claiming that guantanamo bay is not a naval base . 
  nor is the rationale for leasing a restriction : the restriction on commercial activity is . 
  if you want to seriously claim that in one way or another the lease has been violated , i 'd suggest digging up and reading existing arguments against it -- cuba 's had plenty of time to examine every position available -- because they 're going to have done this more-seriously than you will off-the-cuff , and have had people with familiarity in the relevant law cover it . 
   coaling and refueling base if iirc , not a detention center . 
  so it seems clear the us is violating the lease . 
  it 's a naval base with detention facilities . 
   and i am not sure how you believe it 's better that the us held a whole nation hostage for getting the grant . 
  did n't violate any international laws that the us had committed to . 
  nor do countries normally have any sort of obligation to grant independence to their territories , for that matter . 
   finally the principle of territorial integrity was established in the peace of westphalia , signed in 1648 , so a bit earlier than 1980 . 
  * nothing in the peace of westphalia contradicts it . 
  * the us obviously is n't a party to it . 
   nor does it negate the fact that us is occupying a piece of land they have no right to . 
  the us does have right to maintain the base , by virtue of the lease agreement . 
   mmmm i think countries never really like there territory being invaded by foreign nations . 
  fwiw , cuba was legally a territory of the united states at the time the lease was established ; the invasion happened against spain 's empire . 
   at what point were restrictions on invading and occupying countries put in place the issue would be with the lease . 
  * spain ceded cuba to the us in 1899 at the end of the spanish-american war . 
  * the us granted cuba independence in 1902 ; this was done so with the agreement that it provide a [ lease ] ( http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/dip_cuba003.asp ) of indefinite duration of the us to maintain a naval base at guantanamo bay . 
  the only limitation on that lease is that if the us left it , it would no longer have the right to renew it , and that it could n't operate it as a commercial interest -- just as a military base . 
  had cuba not signed the lease , it would not have received independence . 
  * signatories of the 1980 [ vienna convention on the law of treaties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna_convention_on_the_law_of_treaties ) likely may no longer establish such a lease or similar agreement . 
  this would violate article 52 ; the state may no longer be coerced by the use of force or threat of force . 
  however , as per article 28 , the treaty is not retroactive ; it thus does not apply to the guantanamo bay lease . 
  predated any restrictions on it . 
   the navy and lbj knowingly lied about it there was a contact report that was in error , given what we later knew about north korean movement . 
  lbj 's announcement to the public was not a knowing lie . 
   the reichstag fire [ also probably not a false flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichstag_fire#dispute_about_van_der_lubbe.27s_role_in_the_reichstag_fire ) , though taken advantage of . 
   japan and the manchurian `` incident '' that was a [ real false flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mukden_incident ) . 
   turning 9/11 into the invasion of iraq definitely intentionally commingling the hussein and 9/11 in the minds of the public . 
  not a false flag , however . 
   cointelpro and the fbi infiltrating the antiwar and civil rights movements , then committing violent acts in order to discredit and crack down o the movements hmm . 
  i 'm not familiar with the full scope and whether it involved false flag activities -- it involved many different things , but i suspect that the primary interest was in infiltration . 
   and of course , wwii started with a false flag - the `` attacks on ethnic germans '' that hitler used as justification for invading poland in 1939 , kicking off wwii . 
  [ this was a real false flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ) . 
  basically , i think that there 's a strong tendency to over-classify things as false flags . 
  we just do n't have many definite cases , and where they do happen , they involve few people , little damage , and are small-scale . 
  maybe because they 're interesting , maybe because it 's hard to get much of a handle on just what a government or a military is up to . 
  rather , i 'd say that there 's a stronger tendency to be opportunistic , to take advantage of things when they happen . 
  less risk involved in being found out .

  i 'd be cool with making the spellings phonetic once again . 
  annoying for us , but a gift to our children and all that . 
  that 's not what `` dictate '' means . 
  to `` dictate '' is to command someone to do something . 
  it indicates authority over someone else . 
  in the us , the president , for example , could dictate foreign policy to the secretary of state -- he has authority over the secretary . 
  nato members doubtless coordinate foreign policy , but joining nato does not render foreign policy subordinate to the us . 
  in what way ? 
  probably not criticizing the crackdown . 
  every time we do these , it 's normally the case that there are contributions from all over . 
  for example , there are scads of people who could have claimed to have invented the television in some sense . 
  ehhhh ... i suspect that the relevant officials will ignore the ` or else ' bit and just proceed to process the thing . 
  canada , but [ we also have a pre-existing agreement to request and send firefighters to each other ] ( http://wildfiretoday.com/2015/09/18/canadians-aid-u-s-firefighting-effort/ ) :  the albertans came to idaho through a joint agreement between the united states and canada that allows each country to call in firefighting resources from the other in times of need . 
  under the same agreement , american firefighters flew to canada to help out in july at the height of an intense fire season in western canada . 
    last month , after a lightning burst sparked dozens of fires across idaho and the pacific northwest , it was the americans ' turn to call for international assistance . 
  besides alberta , canada also sent firefighters from ontario and the yukon . 
  australia and new zealand also aided the effort . 
  having the aussies and kiwis come in for the yanks and canucks and visa versa actually might make more sense . 
  because they 're in different hemispheres , peak fire season will be at opposite times . 
  smgs shoot pistol ammunition -- armor capable of stopping pistol rounds is an issue for smgs , whereas heavier armor is required to stop rifle rounds . 
   nonsense , russia never gave crimea away . 
  in 1954 ukraine was integral part of soviet union that was russian empire in fact . 
  that was when it stopped being part of russia as a unit , however . 
  russia then gave up claims on it : http://dw.com/en/bound-by-treaty-russia-ukraine-and-crimea/a-17487632  with the end of the east-west confrontation , the csce evolved into the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) , the world 's largest security forum . 
  the osce has 57 member states , including russia and ukraine . 
    the final act obligates its signatories to `` refrain ... from the threat or use of force '' against each other . 
  according to the act , participating states `` regard as inviolable one another 's frontiers '' and `` will refrain now and in the future from assaulting those frontiers . '', 
  they `` will respect the territorial integrity of each of the participating states '' and `` will likewise refrain from making each other 's territory the object of military occupation . 
  russia doubtless did expect to have a greater degree of control over it via controlling ukraine , but , as it turned out , she did n't . 
   hitler invaded no czech republic . 
  you 're right that i should have used the contemporary terms . 
  that invasion and annexation did happen , though . 
   nazi germany first annexed large part of czechoslovakia having international approval of france , britain and italy assisted by hungary and poland that annexed parts of czechoslovakia too . 
  it was presented as a paceful and pace-saving review of the `` injust '' versailles systeme . 
  yes , and today the term `` peace in our time '' is a mockery of how well appeasement worked and a judgment on permitting such a thing to happen again . 
   the current ukrainian geopolitical reality is russia , poland and eu . 
  polish eastern interests and policy are far from german and french . 
  eu expanded after 1989 in east far over its real abilities , the same nato . 
  eu is unable integrate ukraine for many evident reasons , it ca n't help it economically having deep problems .
