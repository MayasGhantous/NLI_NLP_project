  well , i dunno if it actually violates eu law ( and i 'm sure that companies will get as close to violation as possible without crossing the line ) ... but it 's be reasonable to restrict them , as they 're clearly leveraging dominant market positions to try to get into other markets . 
  the fact that , say , the dutch ixquick can not be set as a search engine in android 's browser but google can and is default is obviously extremely sketchy . 
  just as vw or bp did wrong , so can google do wrong . 
  overlooking them just results in companies breaking the law . 
  honestly , i 'd be more concerned that the us had n't done anything about google leveraging android to shovel people into its other services or that vw is n't being punished in the eu . 
  which places are these ? 
  i know of one political `` shame '' thing in india that involved ` marrying ' a goat that made political headlines . 
  is that what . you 're referring to ? 
  with the information we have now , it probably would have been a lot more successful versus germany than what did happen . 
  germany was n't ready in many respects either . 
  germany could n't take poland and defend her western flank against france and the uk . 
  the flip side is that even with an allied victory , it might have created issues . 
  the secret portion of the molotov-ribbentrop pact had the soviet union invading poland two weeks into germany 's invasion . 
  i do n't know what the consensus of historians was on the outcome in terms of countries taking sides , but if it had wound up with the uk and france alone fighting germany and the ussr , things would have probably gone very poorly for france and the uk . 
  two major expansionist empires could have divvied up europe after that point . 
  this article is from al-jazeera , qatar 's state-run international broadcaster . 
  and by `` anglosphere '' , do you include new zealand and the rest , or are you just using it as a shorthand for the uk ? 
  i mean , germany is one of the countries in europe that people in the us can be expected to know * of * and maybe even know some stereotypes of ( engineering , lederhosen ) ... but i 'd have a hard time calling it an obsession . 
  i read a paper with estimates of the economic benefits of ttip . 
  while almost all eu members were expected to see their gdp rise , malta was expected to see a 0.3 % decline . 
  while i 'm with you on the protectionist bit , you could slash taxation as easily as subsidize . 
  i do n't know . 
  agriculture needs cheap labor domestically ( we do this with illegal immigration from mexico and central america ) . 
  labor-intensive manufacturing can be outsourced . 
  we mostly do this with china and southeast asia . 
  there 's some overlap , but ... 
  while i suppose that in theory barroso could have started offering eu trade access to ukraine and a path toward membership at us request , and i probably ca n't prove to you otherwise , i 'd say that it is very implausible that the us would drive that or that the eu 's executive would pay much attention to such a us request . 
  i 'll bet that at least some members have some sort of vague equivalent , even if it 's not at the eu level . 
  in fact , that page links to a uk law , [ bribery act 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bribery_act_2010 ) :  the act has been described as `` the toughest anti-corruption legislation in the world '' , raising the bar above the standard set by the united states foreign corrupt practices act . 
  [ 1 ] despite being `` widely drafted and far-reaching in scope [ and ] in many ways an improvement on earlier corruption legislation '' , significant concerns have been raised , mainly around the fact that the act may harm british industry 's competitiveness in the global market . 
  david aaronberg and nichola higgins , writing in the archbold review , argue that section 6 particularly has the potential to include actions which are ethically problematic but seen as legally permissible . 
  [ 30 ] aisha anwar and gavin deeprose in the scots law times take a similar line , highlighting as particularly problematic areas corporate hospitality and facilitation payments , described as `` essentially a form of extortion on the payer and , although not a common feature in the uk , they are commonplace in many international jurisdictions '' , which may fall under the scope of the act despite being permissible in the commercial world . 
  sure , i get your meaning . 
  i have been trying to point out the block/bloc difference where i see it , because i understand that in a lot of non-english languages in europe , there is no such distinction between the words , so it becomes a really easy error to make . 
   block * block : n 1 : a solid piece of something ( usually having flat rectangular sides ) ; `` the pyramids were built with large stone blocks '' * bloc : n 1 : a group of countries in special alliance, 
   i think all of you guys in the balkans are stupid for creating and going along with this completely unnecessary situation . 
  i have a very limited understanding of the balkans . 
  however , i think that treating the situation as if it were planned or coordinated is misleading . 
  imagine a south american native listening with wonder to someone describing world war i to him , and then saying `` i think that europeans must be stupid for creating and going along with such a situation '' . 
  you 'd probably say `` no , we were n't stupid ... maybe a lack of foresight . 
  many different people took actions that resulted in a situation that nobody wanted or originally intended . '', 
  here 's the problem . 
  remember [ that guy a while back who stabbed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_ikea_stabbing_attack ) two random people to death in an ikea ? 
  that guy survived and could be interrogated , so we know that he stabbed those people because he was n't granted asylum and wanted revenge on swedes . 
  however , while the guy was from africa , he was n't doing it for isis or for religious reasons . 
  if he had died in the attack , quite possibly someone would have claimed credit in the name of isis . 
  why not ? 
  it 's one more high-profile killing of infidels -- take credit where you can . 
  nor is terrorist groups falsely claiming credit a new phenomenon . 
  if you grant isis credit for everything that they 'd like credit for , you wind up looking at and trying to address the wrong problems . 
  we could kill off every member of isis , utterly destroy the organization , but if the real cause of some attacks is people looking for revenge for not getting residence and work permits in the west , then the real problem has n't been solved . 
  solving * that * would require doing something like requiring people to come down to the jail with their personals for the results of their asylum claims and immediately detaining any rejected asylum seekers until deportation . 
  so , yeah , i think that letting isis make and claim credit for things that they were n't responsible for is a bad idea . 
  i wonder if perhaps there is a disproportionate focus on mishaps . 
  i mean , some of the news items that came up , like cutting through a wire gate because a key had been lost , does n't really seem that unexpected or something that i 'd normally expect to find in international news . 
  sounds like biblical text . 
  [ 1 corinthians 11:4 -9 , niv ] ( https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+11%3a4-9&amp;version=niv )  4 every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head . 
  5 but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head -- it is the same as having her head shaved . 
  6 for if a woman does not cover her head , she might as well have her hair cut off ; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved , then she should cover her head . 
    7 a man ought not to cover his head , [ a ] since he is the image and glory of god ; but woman is the glory of man . 
  8 for man did not come from woman , but woman from man ; 9 neither was man created for woman , but woman for man . 
  the usual , `` no '' followed by a link to [ betteridge 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines ) . 
  [ youtube source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yybtmxzgqs ) [ harrison ford explained this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/22xh4j/i_am_harrison_harrison_ford_ama/cgrc21n ) :  we were shooting in tunisia , and the script had a scene in which i fight a swordsman , an expert swordsman , it was meant to be the ultimate duel between sword and whip . 
  and i was suffering from dysentery , really , found it inconvenient to be out of my trailer for more than 10 minutes at a time [ dysentery gives the afflicted diarrhea -- nounhud ] . 
  we 'd done a brief rehearsal of the scene the night before we were meant to shoot it , and both steve and i realized it would take 2 or 3 days to shoot this . 
  and it was the last thing we were meant to shoot in tunisia before we left to shoot in england . 
  and the scene before this in the film included a whip fight against 5 bad guys that were trying to kidnap marian , so i thought it was a bit redundant . 
  i was puzzling how to get out of this 3 days of shooting , so when i got to set i proposed to steven that we just shoot the son a bitch and steve said `` i was thinking that as well . '', 
  so he drew his sword , the poor guy was a wonderful british stuntman who had practiced his sword skills for months in order to do this job , and was quite surprised by the idea that we would dispatch him in 5 minutes . 
  but he flourished his sword , i pulled out my gun and shot him , and then we went back to england . 
  summary : harrison ford improvised the scene the day it was shot because he had to get back to the toilet quickly . 
  i thought that the [ singing sailor ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/14/europe/sweden-russia-gay-sailor-submarine/ ) was going to be what you were going to link to . 
  `` off-guardian '' , eh ? 
  not familiar with it . 
  let 's take a look at the articles . 
  * eu unmasked : after brexit , plans for full eu superstate revealed * america 's oligarchs support clinton almost unanimously * did germany just blink ? 
  [ appears to talk about how the eu is unpleasant to be in and how it wo n't work . ], 
  * koch brothers now support hillary clinton * mh17 inquiry : in times of war , does the law fall silent ? 
  [ argues that mh17 was the fault of ukraine ] * reader 's of canada 's mainstream media mock latest ` russia did it ' stories i see ... 
  except that finland is at the other end of the spectrum from germany , and also has mandatory military service . 
  that is , of course , just what such an android would claim . 
  more-realistically , if there were a world war scenario where the us was tied down in the pacific . 
  the us maintained the ability to fight and win both an atlantic and pacific war simultaneously through the cold war . 
  [ that is no longer necessarily the case ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2011/12/a-two-ocean-navy-no-more/1/ ) . 
  and as can be seen by the example of japan in world war ii , expansionism can be opportunistic -- wait until potential adversaries are tied up , and then attack . 
  thank you for your service . 
  in the past , a lot of greeks * have * rather tenaciously fought , even outside of the military . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_crete  cretan civilians joined the battle with whatever weapons were at hand . 
  [ 83 ] civilians went into action armed only with what they could gather from their kitchens or barns and several german parachutists were knifed or clubbed to death in olive groves . 
  an elderly cretan man clubbed a parachutist to death with his walking cane , before the german could disentangle himself from his parachute . 
  [ 84 ] a priest and his son broke into a village museum and took two rifles from the era of the balkan wars and sniped at german paratroops at landing zones . 
  the cretans used captured german small arms and civilians joined in the greek counter-attacks at kastelli hill and paleochora ; the british and new zealand advisors at these locations were hard pressed to prevent massacres . 
  civilians also checked the germans to the north and west of heraklion and in the town centre . 
  [ 85 ]   the battle of crete was the first occasion where the german troops encountered widespread resistance from a civilian population , which initially surprised and later outraged them . 
  the us does mandate maternity leave , but in many areas it does not -- for example , the government does n't specify paid vacation minimums . 
  however , it 's also the norm for employers to offer paid vacation . 
  i think that a number of folks in europe equate the * existence * of a perk with the government mandating it , whereas i 'd just say that it lets the employer optimize the form of compensation . 
  it is in the interest of an employer to offer perks that cost it the least relative to what the employee values the most . 
   free trade is a fundamental tenet -- along with privatization , deregulation and austerity -- of the agenda that is driving deepening inequality around the world . 
  trade has reduced global inequality more than any other factor out there .
