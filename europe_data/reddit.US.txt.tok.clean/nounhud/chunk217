  in a wealthy country , trade with poorer countries might exacerbate inequality between low-skill and high-skill workers in the wealthy country , but it will also make the poorer country better-off . 
  as for privatization , state-run economies were n't necessarily unequal , but they resulted in people with a lower standard of living than in capitalist economies . 
   if some people think women are worth half a man then , really , they should just fuck off and live elsewhere . 
  this is because women need to cover their head in islam , but men do n't , right ? 
  in france , it 'd be taboo to a woman to walk around without a shirt , but not taboo for a man , right ? 
  and you 'd not object to nuns wearing habits ? 
  i mean , i can think of plenty of things to object to in islam , but the clothing social norms do n't seem very interesting . 
  against maternity leave or government-mandated maternity leave ? 
  he wants the us out of nato . 
  i dunno , is there a global caliphate ? 
  ( not that i 'm defending the closure , which seems pointless ), 
  tineye ca n't find any online instances of this image other than your upload . 
  what 's your source for it , before we start talking about it ? 
  it 's all assertion anyway . 
  how do you measure bureaucratic efficiency , and how does the eu rank on such a scale ? 
   this `` we can do it on our own '' attitude is emanated almost exclusively from older men with a diminishing virulence and a necessity to mimic potency trough having suborned nationalist views and opinions about running the country by taking it on the chin i think you wanted `` diminishing virility '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virulence  virulence is the degree of damage caused by a microbe to its host . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virility  virility ( from the latin virilitas , manhood or virility , derived from latin vir , man ) refers to any of a wide range of masculine characteristics viewed positively . 
  it is applicable to women and not to negative characteristics . 
  the oxford english dictionary ( oed1 ) says virile is `` marked by strength or force '' . 
  virility is commonly associated with vigour , health , sturdiness , and constitution , especially in the fathering of children . 
  in this last sense , virility is to men as fertility is to women . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_netherlands * dutch (  90 % ) * frisian ( 2.50 % ) , * dutch low saxon ( 10.9 % ) * limburgish ( 4.50 % ) * varieties of arabic ( 1.5 % ) , * turkish ( 1.5 % ) * berber languages ( 1 % ) * english ( 90 % ) * german ( 71 % ) * french ( 29 % ) * spanish ( 5 % ) granted , knowledge of french and of english probably has some correlation ( not sure if positive or negative , though ), 
  would n't advocate * lying * about it , but if the guy * can * be classified as mentally-ill , might not be a bad idea to use that term to refer to him . 
  those are specific changes _ there will always be proposed changes that do n't go through in any organization -- and i do n't see any reason to believe that those changes would be more likely if the eu were broken up and started over . 
  also , as eurobonds go ... my assumption is that one day , the eu will issue bonds , just as the us does . 
  but it wo n't be as a back door to let eu members deeply in debt keep running up more debt that the eu as a whole opposes . 
  i do n't see any reason to believe that that is the case . 
  he 's alluding to the phrase `` the south will rise again '' , which refers to the post-war south in the us . 
   we should cut our losses while we can , take a page out of australia 's play book and set up refugee camps on some agean islands and pay greece handsomely for it , god knows they need the money more than erdogan . 
  does n't work . 
  once someone has asylum status , they can travel and work anywhere in the country . 
  the reason that nauru works for this is that the whole country is a poor island . 
  well , presumably turkey will do whatever investigation it 's planning on doing and when it 's done announce that the us soldiers were n't involved , which will cool down one aspect . 
  i assume that that 's going to take some time , though . 
  well , hitler 's second in command did . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rudolf_hess but what 's this about us media ? 
  you mean the reddit livestream ? 
   `` one almost had the impression that it was a guided putsch aimed in the end at making a presidential dictatorship by erdogan possible , '' strache told daily die presse in an interview published on saturday . 
  general consensus is that the reichstag fire was taken advantage of , but was not done by the nazis . 
  one benefit of europe 's use of manual transmissions , i suppose . 
  our deaths from islamic terrorism mostly came from people with knives -- boxcutters -- using them to hijack aircraft . 
  hard to glamorize mentally ill people . 
  might be a good idea from a propaganda standpoint to describe a terrorist as mentally ill if possible . 
  seems like a route for malware . 
  well , infringe on copyright . 
   it 's not a bad idea to stick to the principle that refugee status should be processed at the country of entry , it 's wrong however that it 's supposedly has to be done by that country alone . 
  so that system should be done ( and supported by ) all member states , preferably in a bit more centralized way ( so information is processed better ) . 
  all right . 
  but that 's a principle . 
  what happens when someone does get on a boat and illegally crosses into greece or italy ? 
  you could tightly-patrol the waters , but if up pick them up on the water , that just places them in your hands offshore . 
  the christian science monitor had an article up about how migrants are n't even bothering to make it all the way to italy , but just to driving a small , overloaded inflatable out twelve miles off libya 's shore into international waters , then sending out a distress call until a ship picks them up . 
  what do you do with people who are n't conforming to that ideal , or how do you avoid that from happening ? 
   there would also have to be more resources put into processing so it can be sped up . 
  right now the decentralized and slow system makes for refugees going around from country to country and even those that get rejected just stay illegally ... enforce deportations of people staying illegally . 
  well , to be clear , you * can * make the processing take a while -- the us actually uses that as a loophole in the refugee convention to limit the rate of asylum claims , and has a average-of-three-years , up-to-six-year-long backlog at the moment . 
  the us has a ton of detention centers -- read , prisons -- and throws someone in one until they 're processed or they drop the claim . 
  but what do you do with someone who claims to be from country x , where country x does n't accept them back ? 
  particularly when countries stand to gain a good deal from remittances from workers who are working in the eu ? 
  right now , the eu is [ trying to pay off countries to accept returns ] ( http://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2016/04/29/nigeria-eu-to-start-migrant-return-talks/ ) . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/11991999/eu-wants-african-migrants-to-volunteer-for-deportation.html  the european union 's masterplan to halt the flow of migrants from africa unravelled today after proposals to deport tens of thousands of people were watered down and a major fundraising drive secured a fraction of its target . 
    leaders agreed african migrants who do not qualify for asylum in europe should , ideally , not be forced to go home -- raising serious doubts about how many can be expected to leave . 
    african leaders said the offer of aid was too little , and suggested their citizens should be treated no differently to those fleeing civil war in syria . 
  i do n't think that turkey is all that into spreading radical islam . 
  i imagine that a lot of public statements in international affairs are . 
  just out of curiosity , what would your preferred refugee crisis fix be ? 
   it is up to them to decide this . 
  people in general do n't think much about their military because the last war was simply too long ago for them to remember or care . 
  we [ had a period between 1902 and 1912 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_united_states_at_war ) like that . 
   there is so much educational funding for minorities ( except asians ) affirmative action to favor race in university admissions also penalizes asians in the us . 
   and `` asians '' ( to use a monolithic group label ) ... on terminology ... unlike the us , where `` asian '' means `` east asia '' ( china , japan , south korea , etc ) , in the uk , `` asians '' refers to people from pakistan and thereabouts . 
  it may be misleading to use it on / r/europe -- best to fully qualify the term . 
   they actually committed more murders than white people in total even at 12 % of the population . 
  looking at fbi federal homicide ratio : * [ true for 2012 ] ( https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2012.xls ) , where there was 4,582 white to 5,531 black . 
  * [ not true for 2013 ] ( https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2013.xls ) , where it was 3,005 white to 2,491 black . 
  * [ not true for 2014 ] ( https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2014.xls ) , where it was 3,051 white to 2,451 black . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demography_of_the_united_states the population demographics percentage should be 63.7 % white and 12.2 % black , so he rounded down a bit , but the population percentage is about right . 
  it 'd probably be more-accurate to list an approximate homicide multiplier than to say `` more than '' . 
   in april and may this year , 1 in 17 migrants died trying to make it from the north african coast to italy . 
  that was more than twice the 2015 death rate , according to the geneva-based international organization for migration ( iom ) . 
  that 's a pretty high risk . 
   and they lived happily ever after . 
  2016 r walt disney tm if you went back to 1944 and started describing germany and france 's relationship today to someone in paris then , i 'm pretty sure that they 'd call it less believable . 
  and yet , that was accomplished . 
  i remember reading some article a while back about how closely -- until the financial crisis -- ez member nations had bond rates tracking each other * very * closely . 
  i understand that this indicates the market predicting that other ez members would guarantee a defaulting one . 
  [ here 's a graph showing the beginning of the divergence ] ( http://voxeu.org/article/how-financial-crisis-raised-eurozone-bond-spreads ) . 
  looking at [ current bond yields ] ( http://markets.ft.com/data/bonds/government-bonds-spreads ) , the market appears to have re-evaluated that position -- it no longer places faith that the reliability of the bonds are tied together : * [ ten-year german government bond yield ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=gdbr10&amp;v=201608051730n&amp;d1=20060101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) * [ ten-year greek government bond yield ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=gggb10yr&amp;v=201608051710n&amp;d1=20060101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) they do n't look very similar any more . 
   hell , check every r/politics thread where they 're mentioned if you do n't want to get off reddit . 
  independent of whether-or-not us monetary policy is a good idea -- and i expect that there are things to criticize about it -- / r/politics is a collection of ( mostly-left ) political activists . 
  it is not exactly what you 'd call the most politically neutral group of people in the world , and its positions on monetary policy are , frankly , going to have more to do with political alignment than anything else . 
   to be fair , europeans did the great bulk of that long before the us was ever even an idea . 
  you guys really kicked ass at fucking with native populations back then . 
  it 's kinda hard to separate `` europe '' and `` the us '' at that point in time because what became `` the us '' was mostly a big chunk of those europeans . 
  talking about `` the us '' is talking about people who were in many cases were the descendants of those europeans ( well , the british/dutch/german / british/french ones , at any rate , not so much the spaniards or portugese ) . 
  so it 's really comparing people a hundred and fifty years earlier to those later . 
  i mean , a hundred and fifty years ago , we were holding slaves , you know ? 
  social norms change over time . 
  i do n't think that it 's reasonable to turn this into some sort of quality-of-character dick-waving war between the us and europe .
