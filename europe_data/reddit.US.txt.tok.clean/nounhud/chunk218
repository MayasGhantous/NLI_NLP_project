  hmm . 
  i guess that 's a fair point . 
  the focus in the us is really on the killing of the jews ... slavs are kinda off the radar . 
  i wonder how much allied policy contributed to that , and how much could have been foreseen . 
  the nazis [ originally were also going to simply engage in ethnic cleansing of the jews , stealing their property and whatnot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madagascar_plan ) -- that , i guess , would have been kinda comparable to what the us did to the native americans . 
  then they lost the air war against the uk in world war ii , and no longer had the logistical ability to do so , and moved on to genocide . 
  i do n't know whether the nazis originally intended to kill off people in ukraine and other places either until the [ allies -- including the us , later on -- cut off food heading into the third reich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blockade_of_germany_\\ ( 1939 % e2 % 80 % 9345 \\ ) ) . 
  germany redirected food from occupied territories to her own military efforts , instead starving people elsewhere . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hunger_plan  a meeting on 2 may 1941 between the permanent secretaries responsible for logistical planning for the invasion of the soviet union , as well as other high-ranking nsdap functionaries , state officials and military officers , included in its conclusions :    1 . ), 
  the war can only be continued if the entire wehrmacht is fed from russia in the third year of the war . 
  if we take what we need out of the country , there can be no doubt that tens of millions of people will die of starvation . 
  [ 5 ]   the minutes of the meeting exemplify german planning for the occupation of the soviet union . 
  they present a deliberate decision on the life or death of vast parts of the local population as a logical , inevitable development . 
  [ 6 ] three weeks later , on 23 may 1941 , economic policy guidelines for the coming invasion appeared that had been produced by hans-joachim riecke 's agricultural section of the economic staff east , which had direct responsibility for the economic and agricultural exploitation of the soon-to-be occupied soviet territories :    many tens of millions of people in this country will become superfluous and will die or must emigrate to siberia . 
  attempts to rescue the population there from death through starvation by obtaining surpluses from the black earth zone [ ... ] prevent the possibility of germany holding out till the end of the war . 
  [ 7 ]   the perceived grain surpluses of ukraine figured particularly prominently in the vision of a `` self-sufficient '' germany . 
  hitler himself had stated in august 1939 that germany needed `` the ukraine , in order that no one is able to starve us again as in the last war . 
  '' [ 8 ] :56 yet ukraine did not produce enough grain for export to solve germany 's problems . 
  [ 9 ] scooping off the agricultural surplus in ukraine for the purpose of feeding the reich called for :    * the annihilation of what the german r\u00e9gime perceived as a superfluous population ( jews , the population of ukrainian large cities such as kiev which did not receive any supplies at all ) [ 10 ]   * the extreme reduction of the rations allocated to ukrainians in the remaining cities   * a reduction in the foodstuffs consumed by the farming population [ 11 ]   in the discussion of the plan , backe noted a `` surplus population '' in russia of about 20 to 30 million . 
  if that population was cut off from food , that food could be used to feed both the invading german army and the german population itself . 
  industrialization had created a large urban society in the soviet union . 
  the backe plan envisioned that this population , numbering many millions , would be cut off from their food supply , thus freeing up the food produced in the soviet union , now at germany 's disposal , to sustain germans . 
  as a result , great suffering among the native soviet population was envisaged , with tens of millions of deaths expected within the first year of the german occupation . 
  also , while the us absolutely engaged in ethnic cleansing -- remove natives from desirable land and dump 'em on undesirable land , most if not all activity was not genocidal -- it was simply disinterest in whether natives survived once off the land in question . 
  in genocide , the goal is to wipe a people out . 
  the [ trail of tears ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trail_of_tears ) relocations , probably the highest profile thing , is a good example . 
  disease and malnutrition killed many on the way :  nearly 17,000 choctaws made the move to what would be called indian territory and then lateroklahoma . 
  [ 29 ] about 2,500 -- 6,000 died along the trail of tears . 
  [ snip ]  3,500 of those 15,000 creeks did not survive the trip to oklahoma where they eventually settled . . [ snip ]  13,000 cherokees ... approximately 4,000 cherokees died in the ensuing trek to oklahoma [ there were also various local massacres of and by natives and the immigrating europeans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_indian_massacres ) . 
   the euro area has 340 million people , which is just slightly higher than the population of dollar users at ~ 320 million that 's just the us 's population , at 322m . 
  even aside from secondary use , the usd is the official currency in some non-us countries as well : * panama , at 4m * ecuador , at 16m * el salvador , at 6m * east timor , at 1m also , zimbabwe uses both the euro and dollar as an official currency , at 13m . 
  the overwhelming bulk of deaths were from the introduction of diseases in the americas . 
  i 'm not even sure that that could have been avoided with today 's technology and knowledge , even had people wanted to do so : http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html  when the europeans arrived , carrying germs which thrived in dense , semi-urban populations , the indigenous people of the americas were effectively doomed . 
  they had never experienced smallpox , measles or flu before , and the viruses tore through the continent , killing an estimated 90 % of native americans at the time , the most realistic way to have one 's offspring survive in the long term would have been to have kids with european settlers and hope that they inherited the resistant traits for the diseases in question . 
  also , hitler was genociding a specific group , not `` natives '' .

  east asians in the us commit far less crime than whites in the us . 
  ( note that east asians in the us , due to historic us immigration policy restrictions and latter opening under skilled immigration policy , come disproportionately from immigrants who made it in under skilled immigration policy . ), 
  so really no different than in the us . 
  https://youtube.com/watch?v=j0pl_fxt0em replace the us with the eu and japan with china . 
  it 's pretty silly in the us , too . 
  ukraine was an eu effort . 
  russia walked in and whomped ukraine because ukraine was dealing with the eu . 
   should just leave the bases tomorrow , without telling anyone in the turkish government . 
  leave nothing , say nothing , just leave . 
  uh ... that 's hardly trustworthy behavior . 
   they 've proven too unreliable and untrustworthy to stay ironic ...  any new effort to repair relations will just be wasted . 
  better then giving them the chance to use the people living on the base as political hostages . 
  i think that you 're getting disconnected from reality on this . 
  turkey is n't holding our soldiers hostage or going to .

  erdogan is n't insane .

  meeting with putin is n't objectionable . 
  the eu does it , the us does it , and i 'm sure that turkey does it . 
  he 's a regular . 
  he 's joking . 
  i 'm also curious whether double jeopardy applies to extradition requests . 
  i 'd * assume * not , but ... 
  i 'm not familiar , but the process does not appear to be a fast one : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extradition_law_in_the_united_states  all extradition treaties in force require foreign requests for extradition to be submitted through diplomatic channels , usually from the country 's embassy in washington to the department of state . 
  [ 9 ] many treaties also require that requests for provisional arrest be submitted through diplomatic channels , although some permit provisional arrest requests to be sent directly to the department of justice . 
  [ 9 ] the department of state reviews foreign extradition demands to identify any potential foreign policy problems and to ensure that there is a treaty in force between the united states and the country making the request , that the crime or crimes are extraditable offenses , and that the supporting documents are properly certified in accordance with 18 u.s.c. 
  [ 9 ] if the request is in proper order , an attorney in the state department 's office of the legal adviser prepares a certificate attesting to the existence of the treaty , etc. , and forwards it with the original request to the justice department 's office of international affairs ( `` oia '' ) . 
  [ 9 ]   once the oia receives a foreign extradition request , it reviews the request for sufficiency and forwards appropriate ones to the united states attorney 's office for the judicial district in which the fugitive is located . 
  [ 10 ] the u.s. attorney 's office then obtains a warrant , and the fugitive is arrested and brought before the magistrate judge or the us district judge . 
  [ 10 ] the government opposes bond in extradition cases . 
  [ 10 ] unless the fugitive waives his or her right to a hearing , the court will hold a hearing pursuant to 18 u.s.c. 
  \u00a7 3184 to determine whether the fugitive is extraditable . 
  [ 10 ] if the court finds the fugitive to be extraditable , it enters an order of extraditability and certifies the record to the secretary of state , who decides whether to surrender the fugitive to the requesting government . 
  [ 10 ] oia notifies the foreign government and arranges for the transfer of the fugitive to the agents appointed by the requesting country to receive him or her . 
  although the order following the extradition hearing is not appealable ( by either the fugitive or the government ) , the fugitive may petition for a writ of habeas corpus as soon as the order is issued . 
  [ 10 ] the district court 's decision on the writ is subject to appeal , and the extradition may be stayed if the court so orders . 
  [ 10 ]   habeas corpus is a legal procedure initiated by an individual to test the legality of his detention by the government . 
  [ 11 ] to benefit from habeas corpus , the affected person , or someone on his behalf , must file a petition for relief before a court with jurisdiction . 
  the procedure is contained in 28 u.s.c. 
  when the habeas petition contests the decision of an extradition magistrate , the individual must argue that his detention and surrender to a foreign country violates the united states constitution , the applicable extradition treaty , or a federal statute . 
  [ 12 ]   because orders of extradition can not be appealed , [ 13 ] the only means for an individual to have them reviewed is to file a request for a writ of habeas corpus . 
  the government , on the other hand , may renew its request if the original one is denied . 
  [ 14 ] habeas corpus review by a district court is generally available whenever an individual `` is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states , '' [ 15 ] and is provided for several different types of detention in addition to extradition , such as detention after a criminal conviction , and for military purposes . 
  as part of its habeas review , the court will normally accept the factual findings of the extradition magistrate , [ 16 ] while legal issues are considered anew . 
  [ 17 ]   the scope of review of a writ of habeas corpus in extradition is meant to be limited . 
  [ 18 ] it is settled to cover at least inquiries on whether : ( 1 ) the extradition magistrate acquired jurisdiction over the individual and the matter ; ( 2 ) the crime for which extradition is sought is included within the treaty as an extraditable offense , and ( 3 ) whether there is probable cause to commit the relator to trial . 
  [ 19 ] many courts , however , have adopted an `` expanded '' scope of habeas review that additionally considers issues about the violation of constitutional rights . 
  [ 20 ]   petitioners in extradition cases may contest the legality of their detention though a habeas proceeding by arguing , for example , that the extradition treaty is not in force , [ 21 ] that the alleged crime constitutes political behavior subject to exception , [ 22 ] that the determination of extraditability by the magistrate has not been made according to the requirements of the applicable united states statutes and treaty , [ 23 ] that the extradition procedure does not comply with the constitution , [ 24 ] and that the relator has not been formally charged . 
  [ 25 ]   even though the decision of the extradition magistrate can not be appealed , the habeas corpus determination by the district court is subject to appeal to the corresponding circuit court . 
  thereafter , review may be sought through certiorari to the supreme court . 
  i checked an earlier source and it listed one to three years as being the typical time involved . 
  given the political implications of the thing ( the guy obviously going to the us so that erdogan could n't get at him ) , and questions of jurisdiction ( i assume that the actions in question would have been taken on us soil , and i 'm not sure how extraterritoriality works here ... i remember that in the cliff stoll hacking case , a west german who broke into us military computers working for the kgb from west germany was subject to west german law , not us law . 
  here , gulen may have broken us law but not turkish law or taken actions that are not illegal under us law bit would have been had he been in turkey ) , i doubt that this is going to be one of the shorter cases -- it 's not just a murderer shooting someone and then jumping on a plane . 
  for example , merely urging people to overthrow the us government in an * abstract * sense is [ protected by the us constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yates_v._united_states ) , and i think that that may also apply to anyone legally residing in the us . 
   as recently as between 1993 and 2005 , all but 2 percent of households in 25 advanced economies saw real incomes rise . 
    yet this overwhelmingly positive income trend has ended . 
  a new mckinsey global institute report , poorer than their parents ? 
  flat or falling incomes in advanced economies , finds that between 2005 and 2014 , real incomes in those same advanced economies were flat or fell for 65 to 70 percent of households , or more than 540 million people ( exhibit ) . 
  so in the nine year period starting at the peak before the great recession and then extending from that , things were n't doing so well ? 
  i was being sarcastic -- i understand what he was implying . 
  france is trying hard to liberalize the economy , though . 
  and one might say that the labor competition concerns in the uk that drove brexit was more protectionist than anything that france has done ...
