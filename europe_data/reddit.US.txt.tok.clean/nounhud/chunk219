  in that vein , the fact that the eu data standard is '' [ nuts ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomenclature_of_territorial_units_for_statistics ) '' does not seem coincidental . 
  you could make a new venn circle -- the european statistics gathering alliance . 
  you got to keep your small ice-covered islands , whereas the americas and africa split with the colonizers . 
  are you prepared to fully lower your borders to the world to ensure economic equality of opportunity ? 
  do you feel that a majority of your countrymen would share your position ? 
  well , i 'm sure that some were . 
  they 've contributed in their own way , via mechanisms that are crafted to be more politically acceptable in their own countries -- i suspect that finland has paid quite a lot in the trade sanction effort , for example . 
  the us funded the retraining of police as well . 
  oil and gas policy has had costs to many countries . 
  you ca n't treat that paper as a total of the expenditures related to standing up to russia over crimea and donbas . 
  poland 's pretty close . 
  to be fair , russia has a greater ability to make the lives of most of those countries unpleasant in response . 
   its already well known https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weasel_word, 
  `` if people do n't want our product over the product of competitors , we 'll destroy their products ! '', 
   it would give the eu a good foothold on the african continent as well but ... [ cape verde ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cape_verde ) is a bunch of islands . 
  and there 's already [ ceuta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceuta ) , which is on the continent . 
  more than ireland does , and yet you two are opposites in trust . 
  at least they did n't decide to partition the country * a la * turkey . 
  sometimes vassal states pay tribute to whoever they are a vassal to . 
  maybe he means that canada , the us , poland , the uk , china , and australia are vassals of ukraine ? 
  note that there 's no evidence here that the document is genuine -- i do n't even know where the original photograph was from -- and there might be a lot of parties with reason to forge such a thing , so i 'd take the data here with a grain of salt . 
  nah , man , the kiwis look to be sitting this one out . 
  < shrug  we could guess . 
  cheap way to tie up russia ? 
  turkey and russia are n't on great terms , and i vaguely imagine that china is in a good financial place to be the only country willing to supply russia with a lot of things while sanctions are in place , and russia 's in a terrible place when cutting oil deals with china today . 
  help produce military contracts one day when ukraine 's built its economy up and is wealthier ? 
  like `` oh , we like and are used to this gear '' ? 
  start building diplomatic ties with the country ? 
  i mean , the numbers here are just so small that they just do n't mean all that much -- it 's almost line noise . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armed_forces_of_ukraine ukraine 's annual military budget as of 2016 was 5 % of gdp ( despite their economic woes , part of the country is occupied , so it 's not particularly high ) , and that amounts to $ 4.4 b. 
  the largest number on there is the us contribution , and that 's just a fortieth of ukraine 's military budget . 
  if the us started dumping billions of dollars in , * that 'd * significantly change the shape of ukraine 's military . 
  i 'm going to assume that 's that 's usd being listed on the document . 
  do n't undersell yourself . 
  remember that the us has a lot of money to play with -- that 's not a huge chunk of gdp for the us . 
  ranked by percentage of gdp : | country | % of gdp | spending ( $ ) | | - | :-| - | | canada | 0.0016 % | 23,641,521 | | poland | 0.0011 % | 5,421,745 | | us | 0.0006 % | 117,573,368 | | australia | 0.00038 % | 4,682,498 | | uk | 0.00017 % | 4,975,847 | | turkey | 0.00014 % | 1,052,568 | | china | 0.000030 % | 3,400,000 | honestly , though , none of those figures are significant as a military goes . 
  ah , fair enough . 
  oh , good . 
  maybe there should be a referendum . 
  those always turn out with good decisions being made . 
  anyone who knows romanian : is the text in the red subtitle indicating that the graph has already been converted to a constant currency , to eliminate inflation ( which would otherwise obviously be a huge factor in the graph ) ? 
  and that that currency is the us dollar in 2000 ? 
  i mean , it 's not as if there 's some black-and-white line to become an expert . 
  you 'd think that you could make a secure receptacle that let something of a limited size fall down through a hole into a chamber . 
  removing a post for listing statistics * does * seem pretty dubious , though . 
  i mean , if someone is saying `` muslims are all monkeys and should be burned at the stake '' or something , okay , fine , it 's zero-content , and i can at least understand where someone is coming from in saying that the sub is better-off without it . 
  but if someone 's posting hard data , that can be refuted if it 's wrong and should be taken into account if it 's right . 
  that 's a real contribution . 
  it 's moving a conversation * away * from people just flaming and towards being constructive . 
  then people go on stabbing sprees wearing gas masks !, 
  it rendered the american woman defenseless to the stabbing , at any rate !, 
   we do n't have any small island nations we can force into taking the migrants . 
  does n't need to be near you -- shipping is cheap . 
  does n't even * need * to be an island , if they 're willing to run an isolated , guarded camp , though it obviously makes things easier . 
   greece has already been thrown under the bus at least once . 
  not sure how that would justify more ... and that was after greece permitted nutty spending and lied to the eu about it . 
  you might get greeks to swallow something where their government was in the wrong , but this is n't something that the greek government has done wrong . 
   secondly , i do n't think everyone wants more integration . 
  fair enough , but at a certain point , greece will just say `` the hell with it , we 're leaving ... this is n't worth it . '', 
  unless you think that the eu is better off without greece -- and i doubt that it is , and i further think that if that were the case , those would n't be the terms to part on . 
   we already did so . 
  yeah , but within the framework of schengen -- this was intended to be short-term . 
  doing what you 're talking about is de-facto booting a member out of schengen . 
  if you were going to suspend schengen , then do massive police sweeps to detain , identify , and remove people present illegally country-by-country , that 'd be one thing -- you 'd have a temporary thing in place . 
  but `` turn greece into a giant concentration camp '' is n't on par with that . 
   yeah , i remember gw . 
  they 're not doing terrible well in the polls , despite the recent migrant surge . 
  they might capitalize on greece being turned into a migrant detention camp , but i fail to see them getting into government . 
  would n't need to . 
  would just need to render the country unsafe . 
  come on . 
  if the eu decided to turn norway into a big concentration camp and started simply dumping people they did n't want into norway and closing off the borders , you think that you would n't have far-right groups engaged in violence before long ? 
   the refugee convention has become a holy cow . 
  weird , second time i 've seen this today . 
  just to repeat my earlier comment : [ sacred cow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sacred_cow_\\ ( idiom \\ ) ) means something very different from [ holy cow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_cow_\\ ( expression \\ ) ) . 
   we better replace [ the refugee convention ] with something that actually works before countries start unilaterally withdrawing from it and we 're left in a situation where nothing is left to replace it . 
  well , there i agree . 
   deflation is super bad in the long term since people know their money will be worth more next week , so they save , this reduces spending which is bad for the economy . 
  hmm . 
  what if the return is less than they could get via something else ? 
  so , let 's say you 've deflation of 0.3 % . 
  you deposit your money in a bank , which is probably paying something like 0 % interest . 
  the bank then goes and invests it in something that has a more-significant real return . 
  that 's still keeping the economy functioning . 
  it might clobber consumer spending , but , eh , an economy does n't need lots of consumer spending to function . 
  it just means that everyone is choosing to invest in things with a return . 
   he is probably exactly the same in terms of clothes , accent , behavior , etc as other british somali teenagers in london other than , you know , the whole stabbing spree thing . 
  [ pacific solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) . 
  just saying . 
   plan b of walling in greece in case of a breakdown in the eu-turkey deal might work as soon as the migrants realize that they 're stuck in greece and ca n't make it further north . 
  once they realize that they 're stuck and that conditions are bad , the flow should slow to a trickle . 
  i think that you 're confusing the [ pacific solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) ( which i 'd consider to be viable ) with `` turn greece into an unwilling detention camp '' , which i think is not . 
  let us list the problems : * you 're throwing an eu member under the bus . 
  bad precedent to set . 
  certainly not good for working towards future integration if that 's what you want . 
  * putting up internal borders in schengen is n't a great precedent either . 
  * if you think that people wo n't sneak across the land border or that greeks wo n't ship migrants across in boats , people who will then claim that they showed up directly and never went through greece , i think that you 're being unreasonably optimistic . 
  greece certainly is n't going to help out and register people if it 's being run over by the bus . 
  * remember golden dawn ? 
  i bet you that they are n't gon na like that much .
