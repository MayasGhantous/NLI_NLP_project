  the uk used to have some funky thing where certain people could be `` british subjects '' but not `` british citizens '' iirc . 
   washington dc residents can vote in presidential elections . 
  no they ca n't . 
  well , not in general elections -- the parties , if cross-state , can do whatever they want in the primaries , since that 's a party function rather than a governmental function . 
  they could just flip a coin or have the party leadership select someone . 
  the reason why is that remember , we do n't have direct elections . 
  your vote is used as an input to tell how the vote granted your federal representative is used . 
  in a state , you get two senators for the state and a number of representatives proportional to population . 
  each of those gets one electoral college vote for president , which is assigned to an elector to cast . 
  the voting you personally do is used as an input for how those electors vote . 
  this is done in some state-defined way , which currently for all states is ` whoever gets the most votes in the state gets control of * all * the votes from all of the state 's electors ' . 
  dc and all non-state lands in the us have no senators representing them , so they do n't get the two votes from that , and they do n't get voting representatives in the house ( though at least dc and iirc some other locations have arranged to have non-voting representatives present ) . 
  the visa waivers are n't predicated on special treatment ; if france goes over the threshold , france gets removed ; if romania or poland falls under the threshold , they get added . 
  there 's no objection to poles . 
  i do hear complaining on here from the brits about poles . 
  my childhood best friend was polish-american . 
  our neighbor for some years until she passed away was the first woman to receive a doctorate in poland or the first to receive a doctorate in mathematics or something like that . 
  dad would always shovel her walk and trim her trees when doing ours , as she was a bit elderly , and i remember diagnosing and replacing damaged components on her computer after her chimney was hit by lightning . 
  while i wo n't claim that there are n't countries that might catch popular objection in the us ( like , maybe places in the middle east ) , poland 's really not a country that i think would show up on any such list , at least in a modern day post-caring-about-lots-of-catholics-coming-to-the-us era . 
  i do n't think that people in the us know much about romanians , by-and-large ; i work with two , but there are n't many who came to the us . 
  i did n't even know about the whole `` people in europe associate gypsies and romanians '' thing until coming to this forum ... and , heck , for that matter , `` gypsy '' has rather less-negative connotations in the us than in europe . 
  what i 'm getting at is that there 's no special arrangement unique to those countries to try to discourage romania or poland from having people travel to the us . 
  good grief , what is it with you ? 
  iraq participation was n't a * quid pro quo * for visa waivers , or france would n't have visa waivers today . 
  the european union can set visa policy to wherever the eu wants as well . 
  if it results in a loss of reciprocity , i 'd assume that the us would in turn also remove reciprocity . 
  hmm . 
  that 's from the legal code , though -- congress probably is n't going to go in detail there , because that 's a pain to revise . 
  the ins may publish its criteria publicly , but they would n't be part of legislation -- via that act , congress just grants the ins bounded authority . 
   so puerto ricans can vote in us elections ? 
  man , til . 
    oh wait , they ca n't the lack of ability to vote in ( federal ) elections is not a function of their citizenship , but of their place of residence ; it happens to do with how the us voting system is structured . 
  the same applies to residents of washington , dc , because they have no state representatives . 
  if people in dc or puerto rico move to a state , that 's state 's representatives in the electoral college will vote for them , same as anyone else . 
  citizens of american samoa are n't us citizens , and their passport explicitly says that they are not . 
  i 've no idea what france 's classification of them is or whether it 's an element of us reciprocity ( i would * assume * not , but i do n't know , and it 's such a small number of people that i doubt that it 's a huge political issue one way or the other ) . 
   or use political levearage . 
  okay . 
  personally , i think that if france feels that strongly and is willing to extend costs to herself , it 'd make more sense for her just to provide french passports upon request to other eu members , but i imagine that cutting a deal is n't unimaginable . 
  what 's france going to be putting on the table in exchange ? 
  will she , say , foot the excess bill for tracking down visa overstays ? 
   before that , yeah no visas for american outer seas territories . 
  they 're not really american . 
  < shrug  france can set her visa requirements however she likes . 
  eu member countries also are n't equivalent to us territories : people from french overseas territories are french citizens , and treated as such by other countries in the world . 
  look , if you want the eu to be treated as a single country by the rest of the world , there 's a really straightforward way to do it -- you federalize the thing . 
  at that point , every other country in the world says `` okay , we thumbs-up or thumbs-down the european union as a country '' . 
  at that point , countries open embassies to the eu , eu citizenship becomes a meaningful thing for other countries in the world , etc. 
  but if * you * are n't willing to treat the eu as a country , how realistic is it to expect the rest of the world to do so ? 
  if you do n't want to form a single country , i imagine that you could presumably still form a common passport-issuing bloc , which is what other countries are going to care about -- if someone is a citizen of an eu member and requests a french passport , you issue it . 
  that also obviously means that france will be be affected by excessive visa rejections for people that it issues new french passports to , but ... < shrug  it 's a two-edged sword , yeah ? 
  or poland 's visa rejection rate drops below threshold and poland gets added , which also would work , albeit this being specific to the us visa waiver program . 
  france is n't specially let in because it 's france , nor poland excluded because it 's poland -- at the moment , france passes criteria for visa waivers and poland does n't . 
  if poland moves below the threshold and france rises above , france will be removed from visa waivers and poland added . 
  ` snot a matter of country-specific bias . 
  if france wants to end visa-free travel for us citizens , that 's france 's prerogative as a sovereign country . 
  france will also be removed from the us visa-free list . 
  people will still be able to visit the other country , just with some extra headache . 
  does n't make much sense to me , but if that 's what france wants , france is certainly free to do so . 
   what is the reason for poland not being on the visa-waiver list , when other countries in the region ( us , slovaks and hungarians ) are already on the list ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dqm51/eu_may_require_visas_from_americans_and_canadians/d1tfpma there 's a numeric rate for visa rejection rates that past applicants need to be under for a country to be in , and poland is n't currently under that threshold . 
  it 's not a poland-specific restriction . 
   the requirements are clear but since there is no objective criteria for your visa to be accepted https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/general/denials.html  if denied a visa , in most cases the applicant is notified of the section of law which applies . 
  from the paper i was linking to :  of the 171 cases examined for this study , a small minority ( roughly four percent ) resulted in positive outcomes for the boycotting parties . 
  these cases fell into two very different categories : cases where the opposition party had considerable popular support and the boycott was merely one piece of a larger opposition campaign that could mobilize street protests , strikes and other forms of civil unrest , ** and cases where electoral laws required quorums to proceed ** . 
   but many no-voters want the eu to lose credibility . 
  do they ? 
  i could certainly understand wanting a smaller eu or opposing federalism , but it seems difficult to me to see any benefit provided to the countries of the eu in being less-trustable -- it means that in cases where simply providing a guarantee might have been sufficient , instead other sorts of things might need to be placed on the line . 
  i 'm referring to future eu foreign policy , like extending security guarantees or arranging future trade deals with other countries , rather than internal negotiations . 
  could have also been the folks reporting the story ... just saying . 
  for at least some of these , it 's totally reasonable to limit the domain -- e.g. 
  run just one route . 
  that makes it an easier problem than providing the general end-user-friendly self-driving-car-for-all-situations . 
  my guess is that that will be early in the self-driving-car area . 
  also result in a lot of unemployment for a while , since a lot of people work in transportation and they 'll all need to be moved to other areas . 
  [ * increasing childlessness in europe * ] ( http://vaestoliitto-fi-bin.directo.fi/@bin/553e1ac6a75bbf16f6cbb00a7251a4e2/1460013809/application/pdf/3746805/working%20paper%205_increasing%20childlessness%20in%20europe_1.pdf ) : providing an excerpt from each listed cause :  * ** lack of partners **   historically and across societies , failure to marry has been the most common reason for childlessness . 
    * ** later parenthood **   the age at first birth , or transition to parenthood , has been increasing throughout europe in the last decades , and will exceed 30 in several countries and subpopulations . 
    * ** higher divorce rates and union dissolution risks **   divorce levels have been rising in most european countries . 
  cohabitation has become an increasingly popular type of union , and cohabiting unions are known to dissolve more often than marital unions do . 
  also childlessness is more common in cohabiting unions ( baiz\u00e0n et al. 
    * ** material resources and social status **   the effect of material resources on childbearing varies with the stage of the demographic transition of the society in question . 
  in poor and preindustrial environments , having access to more resources and wealth is generally related to earlier and higher fertility . 
  in highly developed societies and low fertility societies , this association is typically reversed and wealthier families tend to have fewer children . 
    * ** women 's social position **   women 's increased economic independency and educational attainment has increased the similarity in gender roles and expectations for men and women . 
  the relationship between fertility and gender equality remains unclear , however . 
    * ** individualization and value liberalism **   processes of value liberalisation and individualisation affect family formation . 
  in liberal and tolerant societies , women and men decide whether they opt for parenthood or not according to their own preferences largely . 
  although second demographic transition theory makes no specific predictions regarding childlessness , childbearing is predicted to be more affected by individual preferences and choices instead of social and marital institutions ( van de kaa 2007 ) . 
  either russia has very different ip law from the us , or the story should have been referring to `` trademark '' rather than `` copyright '' . 
  i still think that if that was truly the primary motivation , that this was n't the best way to go about it -- instead , something should have been raised requiring , say , explicit commitment from member states for the eu to make certain agreements or for states to have representatives involved in a committee that sets the bounds within which eu representatives should negotiate . 
  that sets before-the-fact restrictions rather than after-the-fact undermining . 
  this way , while it might cause brussels to voluntarily try something like that , it also costs eu credibility , and that 's very expensive and slow to obtain . 
  i still see poles on this forum saying that they would n't trust france to fight for them ... and the [ invasion of poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_poland ) was over seventy years ago , with all decision-makers involved long in their graves . 
  i recognize that the netherlands has to weigh policy change against loss in eu credibility . 
  i 'm just saying that i personally would n't have taken this route , were it washington involved instead of brussels . 
  anyway ... < shrug  the result is in , and the question now is what kind of actual effect it will have , on all three of the actual policy of the dutch government , the political situation in eastern europe , and the eu 's credibility in future negotiations . 
   i 'd say not voting is the only logical thing an individual can do . 
  [ * threaten but participate : why election boycotts are a bad idea * ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2010/2/election%20boycotts%20frankel/02_election_boycotts_frankel.pdf ) that being said , this is really a special case in that the thing could be ( and came close to ) being invalidated by non-participation . 
  it sure wo n't make future eu diplomatic negotiations easier . 
  i 'd think that sum of imports and exports would be more interesting in measuring disruption than deficit or surplus .
