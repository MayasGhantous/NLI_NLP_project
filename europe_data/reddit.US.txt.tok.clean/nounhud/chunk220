  the whole purpose of using greece as a holding facility is because you 're unwilling to withdraw from the refugee convention , and because that has a `` first safe country '' clause , yes ? 
  once illegal immigrants start running around in large numbers in greece , want to bet that golden dawn and friends are going to start beating them up ? 
  and then they 've got an unsafe country and a legal refugee convention claim to head into the rest of the eu . 
  also ... i realize that eu member states have stronger divisions than us states and all , but ... seriously , what the hell is wrong with you ? 
  you 're going to fuck over a fellow eu member because it 'd be slightly politically-awkward to withdraw from the refugee convention for you ? 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
  if you do n't want to accept refugees , and you 're willing to go to extreme lengths to stop them , just cut the charade and stop granting them legal access to move freely and work in the country . 
  here 's a perfectly-legal path that accomplishes just as much as the far-more-destructive path of beating up on greece : * you announce that you are withdrawing from the refugee convention . 
  there is a one-year delay . 
  after that time , you are no longer bound by the refugee convention . 
  while i personally think that something * like * the refugee convention would be a good idea , i also think that the existing thing is seriously flawed and needs to be revised to avoid economic migration and to permit intake caps . 
  * cap the processing rate to limit the intake for that year . 
  * terminate the path to citizenship to asylees . 
  that can be done immediately -- it 's just national policy , no international treaty . 
  now , that may tick off people who feel that you * should * accept people for asylum . 
  it may irk people who feel that it conflicts with some humanitarian ideals . 
  but it is n't screwing over greece , and if you were going to dump said refugees in greece , you 'd be abandoning those ideals * anyway * . 
   the current system the usa has were it takes in about 70k a year keep in mind that 70k/year is the naturalization cap for refugees . 
  you 've got a couple of relevant numbers here . 
  first , the rate of accepting people into the country for refugee evaluation . 
  this is basically unbounded for both germany and the us , and realistically it 'd be pretty awful to put a bound on it -- you 'd have people just be dumped back . 
  in the us , that 's just going to get you into a prison/detention facility , though . 
  you do n't get to move freely or work or anything like that . 
  the us has [ a lot of capacity to hold migrants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_detention_sites_in_the_united_states ) :  this is a list of migration-related detention sites in the united states . 
  the united states maintains the largest immigration detention infrastructure in the world , which by the end of fiscal year 2007 included 961 sites either directly owned by or under contract with the federal government , according to the freedom of information act office of the ice ( ice ) . 
  during the period 2007-2009 , no less than 363 detention sites were used . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] people in some of europe were placed in sites where it was n't realistically possible to keep them from leaving , particularly in transit countries that kinda hoped that they 'd just leave and head on to germany or some other destination country . 
  i do n't know about germany . 
  some people are simply working under the table and will never have been processed at all . 
  next , * if * you 've been accepted into the application system , you 're in a [ jail/concentration camp/detention facility ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfyzpuihhck ) . 
  where you wait . 
  you can request to be sent back home at any time , but if you want to go through the refugee process , that 's effectively capped by the refugee evaluation bandwidth -- extensive security screening and the works . 
  in the us , we were doing iirc a few thousand from syria a year . 
  i do n't know what germany 's throughput of granting asylum is , but it has to be higher . 
  if you get through that , then you have legal asylum status and have legal right to live and work in the us , though i believe that you 'd be subject to be deported if your country becomes safe again . 
  if you have * that * legal status , up to 70k globally per year ( and a smaller chunk by continent , which caps large-scale influxes ) can actually get citizenship in the us . 
  i * think * that germany does not place bounds on this number , though i 'm not sure . 
  for the us , anyone born on us soil is a us citizen , whether their parents are present illegally or not -- so even if you 're in the evaluation process , in a detention facility , your kids can get us citizenship . 
  [ for germany , with some restrictions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli#restricted_jus_soli ) , if someone who has gotten legal asylum status and stayed long enough in germany under that status has a kid , that kid gets german citizenship even if the parent never does . 
  kids born in germany to parents still in the evaluation process or just working illegally and unprocessed do not get german citizenship . 
  oh , i was alluding to operation paperclip in particular -- the scientists were n't forced out , is what i mean . 
   does n't the eu have the right to refuse people as well then ? 
  and send them back to the nation they crossed ? 
  sure . 
  as long as they do n't violate ( or withdraw from ) either of a couple of relevant treaties , which are a problem here : ** [ refugee convention , illegal migration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) ** :  article 31 . 
    refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge   1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article i , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence . 
  this , depending upon interpretation , covers certain countries involved . 
  or it 's at least hard to prove that it * does n't * cover certain countries involved , since syria is close enough that maybe someone came directly . 
  once someone is given asylum status , they can move within the country and work wherever they want and receive welfare benefits and so forth , all mandated by the refugee convention . 
  the united states , when faced with this , has stretched the definition to the limit and said that this only applies to people who have been granted refugee status ( which is technically true ) , and that the country can spend as long as it wants * evaluating * whether-or-not a person is a refugee ( which is true -- kinda a significant loophole in the refugee convention , same as the fact that it does n't let a country set any limits on intake ) , and proceeded to dump people at [ prisons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_detention_sites_in_the_united_states ) or isolated , concentration camps off us soil while it processes them . 
  which may take a long time , and the us may intentionally only process a certain number per year . 
  also , i believe unlike germany , the us sets hard numeric limits on the refugee path to citizenship -- you may be able to stay and work legally , and your children born on us soil may become citizens , but [ if an influx of the size that germany is seeing comes in , even if they get refugee status , they wo n't get citizen status ] ( http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/how-united-states-immigration-system-works-fact-sheet ) . 
  we 've already said that we are n't granting citizenship to more than 12k african refugees a year , even if they meet all other barriers to making it over . 
  scaling to our relative population sizes , that 'd be like germany imposing a cap of 3k/year . 
  furthermore , because from outside of a few places it takes a large ship/plane to get to the us , and because anyone contributing to illegal immigration is liable to have their ship/plane seized , it 's quite difficult to get across the pacific from africa to the us to claim refugee status in the first place , whereas with europe , if you can get your hands on a cheap , overloaded boat that can manage to stay afloat long enough to make the hop into the eu , you 're golden . 
  ** [ refugee convention , non-refoulement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) ** :  article 33 . 
    prohibition of expulsion or return ( `` refoulement '' )   1 . 
  no contracting state shall expel or return ( `` refouler '' ) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 
  the benefit of the present provision may not , however , be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is , or who , having been convicted by a final judgement of a particularly serious crime , constitutes a danger to the community of that country . 
  so you ca n't just pick someone up and dump them back in some country if it does n't meet the definition of `` safe '' . 
  which germany has decided that certain countries , like syria and eritrea , are not . 
  finally that country has to accept them . 
  you ca n't just dump random people on the shore of some country any more than nigeria can dump random groups of people that it does n't want onto the uk 's shores . 
  that 's true even if they crossed through that country . 
  normally , there 's pressure put on countries to accept their own nationals ( and people awaiting deportation may be stuffed in a prison/concentration camp , so they probably do n't want to stay ) , but people who * are n't * accepted do n't get dumped over there . 
  if you 've got some random guy claiming to be syrian , even if the syrian government is functioning enough to evaluate whether them to be syrian , and even if it 's safe ... if the guy is actually nigerian , syria probably is n't going to accept him back . 
  some countries , like nigeria and pakistan , are safe but have people who want to try and use the refugee loophole to live and work in the eu , because they can make a ton more money . 
  my strong suspicion is that the `` right '' solution is probably to modify the refugee convention ( maybe via withdrawal and adopting a replacement treaty ) . 
  it was originally written to deal with a one-off situation in europe after world war ii , where economic migration really was not a major concern . 
  because it then became permanent and globally-applied some years down the road , applying to countries which had huge differences in wealth , and as transportation got cheaper and easier , it never got good mechanisms to deal with economic migration -- there was no way to apply caps or hold people in camps to discourage economic migration . 
  nobody was being * forced * in . 
  that 'd be inhumane . 
  if someone wanted to live under the soviets , that was an option . 
  i do n't think greece would like that , and throwing eu members under the bus sets a bad precedent . 
  edit : and as soon as greece has golden dawn running around beating the hell out of said refugees , they 're going to immediately be able to apply the refugee convention to move out of greece . 
  wan na bet on how long it will take for golden dawn and friends to start beating up illegal migrants if greece gets used as a holding camp by the eu ? 
  based on history , we 're clearly okay with german scientist and engineer refugees . 
  you could just withdraw from the refugee convention . 
  orban 's razor wire can just be lifted up . 
  razor wire is sufficient to slow people , not stop them . 
  you sourcing * yes , minister * for this ? 
  not as crazy as syria . 
  does n't the eu 's political structure penalize large members relative to their size ? 
  were n't people on here complaining about turkey dragging nato toward war with russia by shooting down the plane ? 
  well , he apologized ... and now people are complaining about that . 
  my understanding is that germany tried intaking low-education turks . 
  this demographic predominantly votes akp . 
  the uk and us had a skilled immigration process and both have chp voters dominant . 
  they are n't serving [ luther burgers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luther_burger ) yet . 
  you should probably use a more accurate term than ` local news ' , because that 'd confuse me too . 
   the blackmail where erdogan threatens to send waves of refugees in the direction of europe unless the eu gives them monies , accession chapter progress and visa liberalisation . 
  turkey does n't have an obligation to keep people from leaving -- in fact , there are restrictions on what countries can do to stop people from leaving . 
  the un declaration of human rights , article 13 , section 2 :  everyone has the right to leave any country , including his own ... ordinarily , the responsibility is that of the destination state to control illegal entry . 
  the eu is trying to get turkey to do something special , to go out of the way to stop people and put 'em in camps , and offered turkey perks if it did so . 
  turkey 's not extorting the eu on that point . 
  it 's still a miniscule cost compared to something serious like auto accidents . 
  he has n't turned turkey to russia , and as some turk on here was explaining , gulenists are n't kemalist . 
  that 's not what the article was saying was happening -- just that they were in the business of human smuggling . 
  i do n't think that insults would normally be grounds for not supporting a government against a coup .
