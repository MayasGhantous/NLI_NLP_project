  what blackmail are you referring to ? 
   can we just push the turk out of thrace and cyprus and be done win it ? 
  i 'd say that that would be an unwise escalation . 
  was n't a major chunk of the reason that people wanted out of the eu was less competition for unskilled labor so that people could find employment ? 
  i mean , this is what it looks like . 
   military cooperation has always been the `` holy cow '' of belarusian-russian integration heh . 
  the translator probably wanted `` sacred cow '' . 
  `` holy '' and `` sacred '' are synonyms , but the terms using them mean very different things . 
  [ `` sacred cow '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sacred_cow_\\ ( idiom \\ ) ) is an idiom for something which is considered so essential , so sancrosanct , as to be unquestionable ... even though maybe it should n't be . 
  [ `` holy cow '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_cow_\\ ( expression \\ ) ) is an informal exclamation meaning `` wow ! '', 
  would a majority have wanted it if they realized what it entailed ? 
  the overwhelming bulk of muslims are not at war . 
  eh , she acts as an intercessor with a special status . 
  kinda like a priest performing the eucharist , but nobody would say that the priest is worshipped . 
  `` the secular authorities clearly can not ferret out the muslim !, 
  let , once again , the inquisition rise !, 
  god wills it ! '', 
  honduras has the highest murder rate in the world , and it 's pretty catholic . 
   however there 's boulders raining down on us so a little chastising of those doing the throwing rather than tut-tutting at the pebbles other have been throwing would be nice . 
  perhaps he 's aiming to not start a religious war . 
  [ a very old hashtag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antipope ) . 
  at the time the us split off , the idea of a military alliance with the british empire would have been taken in a very dim light . 
  nobody cares today . 
  time is the ever-soothing balm . 
  go back to 1944 and ask a pole or a frenchman how they 'd feel about a military alliance ( and political union ) with germany . 
  the party label is important too . 
  trump -- even with a self-funded campaign -- would n't be likely to be doing nearly as well as an independent . 
  you mean / u/savannajeff . 
   history dose n't go away . 
  ~ ~ ireland ~ ~ the united states will never be in a military alliance with britain . 
  mabey if they got rid of the queen and declared a republic and the people were n't subjects anymore . 
  for completeness , archive.org [ first snapshotted the webpage with the tpp text at the address you referenced on november 5 , 2015 ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20151105190726/https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/tpp-full-text ) . 
  i 'd say that it 's not so much a criticism of knowing the term as it is pointing out that a lot of political processes do n't work the way they might seem to . 
   we have a lot of ftas which are basically the same ... for the sake of including the specifics : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements, 
  tpp 's complete and up for signing . 
  the ttip approval numbers were [ from a pew poll ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/is-europe-on-board-for-a-new-trade-deal-with-the-u-s/ ) . 
  [ this is the document with the estimated per-country gdp impact ] ( http://www.amchameu.eu/sites/default/files/ttip_member_state_study.pdf ) . 
  edit : i was slightly-off -- malta had the second-highest approval rating in the eu , not the highest . 
   hell even jupp\u00e9 has said that he 'd oppose ttip in its current form . 
  as did hillary . 
  and without looking at anything that he 's said , i 'll bet that , like her , he avoided any specifics about what he objected to , simply giving the impression that he was opposed to it , because at the moment it happened to be unpopular . 
  he did n't commit to changing points x , y , and z , in concrete and measurable terms , yes ? 
  so then said agreement comes up , and there 's some minor changes made and he says that his concerns have been addressed and it goes through . 
  that is what you elect politicians to create policy to avoid . 
  if you do n't want your trade negotiators making the call on trade negotiations , it seems to me that you need to believe one of two things : * first , that the negotiators are incompetent . 
  i doubt that in negotiating a large trade deal with the us , that europe put forward people that it considers incompetent . 
  i do n't know anything about them personally , but i 'd be surprised if they are n't considered on top of things . 
  * second , that the negotiator 's interests have been split away from those of the people who they represent . 
  maybe you think that they 're willing to accept a deal that is worse for the eu on the whole in order to benefit a particular eu company . 
  maybe you think that they 've invested in some industry and stand to benefit . 
  maybe you think that the us has bribed eu negotiators . 
  i do n't think that the best fix , in either case , is to move to a referendum on the matter . 
  if you are worried about benefit of a particular eu company , this seems to be a normal issue in any sort of policy-making , and the solutions would seem to be the same . 
  if you 're worried about a negotiator being , oh , placed on the board of some company , then you need to do is to realign their incentives . 
  say `` you are prevented from working for the next thirty years or receiving income from sources via route x , y , or z , but we will extend a very fat pension to you '' . 
  or , give them a bonus tied to how gdp expansion after ttip looks . 
  if you 're worried about investments in an industry , i assume that there 's some sort of disclosure requirements already in place . 
  if you 're worried about bribery , there are already laws on graft ; if you think that they 're insufficiently-strong , they could be strengthened . 
  now , all this just deals with negotiators not addressing the interests of their country as a whole . 
  then you 've got people who feel that their * particular * interests might not be addressed . 
  for example , is french maize competitive with us maize ? 
  maybe some farm goes out of business or has to grow something that 's less-lucrative . 
  some people will almost assuredly be disadvantaged in any large change in economic environment , regardless of what that is . 
  but if you want to offset impact , you can create policies at a lower level , like a retraining fund for people in impacted industries -- if people benefit from less-expensive food , but someone else faces job loss , perhaps that 's an externality to iron out . 
  but , again , i 'm not seeing a benefit to eliminating specialists from the equation . 
  finally , if it turns out that the thing is actually a loss , there 's always the nuclear option of leaving it . 
  i strongly doubt that it * will * be a loss -- i do n't know of any trade agreements in either the [ european union 's collection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) or the [ united states ' collection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_free_trade_agreements ) that have been cancelled , but it 's an option . 
  that 's got some nice benefits -- keeps things stable -- but the problem is that it fundamentally involves a lot of specialist knowledge . 
  you 're asking to replace a specialist role in the bureaucracy with public opinion . 
  i 'm having a hard time imagining getting the overall public in a country speaking comfortably and with understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of trade deals . 
  could it be done ? 
  yeah , if you wanted to throw enough time at it . 
  if you gave everyone in the country the equivalent of an economics degree , that 'd certainly do it . 
  but how much time is it going to require on a per-person basis in a country to bring people up to speed on the ideas and concerns involved ? 
  and what 's the return ? 
  i mean , you have a bureaucracy so that you can leverage specialist knowledge . 
  you do n't normally say `` okay , let 's have a referendum on whether the military should take this island or this island '' in a war or `` let 's have a referendum on how we structure tort actions '' or `` let 's have a referendum on how we allocate radio frequency spectrum '' because they 're all tied to specialist fields , and you 're going to need to do a heck of a lot of bringing people up to speed on them . 
  instead , you focus on obtaining specialists and then setting up oversight of those specialists that are aligned with your interests -- and you just elect the overseers . 
  i was looking at estimates of economic benefit on ttip . 
  germany would be one of the primary beneficiaries in terms of gdp growth , but has one of the most-opposed publics in the eu . 
  malta is the only eu member that is actually expected to see a gdp * reduction * as a result , but has the most-enthusiastic public in the eu . 
  there 's a significant disconnect between the public and the bureaucracy 's understanding of the issue . 
  i think that the uk 's diplomatic corps probably had a more-informed position on brexit than did the public . 
  i suspect that the eu 's trade negotiators probably have a more-informed position on trade agreements than the public . 
  it 's not clear to me that either side has been negotiating in good faith . 
  you want a viable deal , you need measurable milestones and you need the final outcome to be something where each side is winding up better off than they were before . 
  offering to fast-track turkey 's eu membership seems like a bad idea . 
  it probably was n't something up for realistic offer , and i assume that the reason it came up was because it was n't measurable by turkey . 
  i 'm skeptical that visa-free access is either . 
  if turkey is going to run camps , it should be a straightforward `` here is what we offer per head , here is the time limit , and here is the verification process . 
  here is the list of people that turkey does not have to accept . '', 
  or , if you want work visas , have a real work visa program that both sides are happy with . 
  a deal , a stable , honest , good deal , has to have both sides making good-faith offers for an environment in which both are better off than in the * status quo * . 
  if that is n't going to happen , there 's not much point in negotiating . 
  all right . 
  i predict not . 
  if nato wanted war with russia , there would have been war a long time ago . 
  only one side needs to want war for there to be war . 
  would n't the quote have been translated ? 
  leave crimea and have sanctions ended ?
