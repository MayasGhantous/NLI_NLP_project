  it 's probably just backlash against the person polling them -- i understand that 95 % of bulgarians have either a `` somewhat negative '' or `` very negative '' opinion of the bulgarian polling company . 
  thanks !, 
  we like you too !, 
  i am guessing that some people in europe see turkey becoming more authoritarian and islamic under erdogan as something that other european countries might wind up doing , and that it is truly concern about that speaking . 
  looks like it 's just interest on the mortgage that 's deductible , like us . 
  we do first and second houses and i 'm [ dubious ] ( http://mercatus.org/publication/home-mortgage-interest-deduction ) that [ it 's a good idea ] ( http://reason.org/files/mortgage_interest_deduction.pdf ) ... but you do unlimited ?

  huh . 
  i 'm not familiar with what 's normal , but glancing around , it looks like in the us , [ mortgages dominate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_position_of_the_united_states#debt ) . 
  that does n't measure strength of the economy , but complexity . 
  i 've not gone through the criteria , and it might be that i would n't agree with them , but being a ` powerhouse ' is n't necessary to be complex . 
  for example , the aussies are wealthy , but going from memory , a lot of that was from demand for resource extraction from china . 
  theoretically , asylum is supposed to keep people safe during a crisis , which that would accomplish . 
  i still think that it would be politically wiser to have eu officials do this , not people expected to simultaneously represent their state and the eu . 
  otherwise people do n't feel that they have input and the state catches blame for whatever happens . 
  spread around the world and structured to mitigate risk , that has a worse expected return than negative-yield bonds ? 
   contrary to the anglosphere , the ecb is not meant to keep employment up . 
  looking online , that seems to be unique to the us -- at least canada and the uk have a single mandate . 
  i do n't think that that 's anglosphere-wide policy . 
   looks like all is going according to putins plan . 
  that article says that his plan calls for dismantling china , turning the eu into a combination of russian-annexed territory , russian-controlled territory , and states too afraid of russia to do anything , and throwing the us into impotent disarray . 
  at the moment , the [ us , the eu , and china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( nominal \\ ) ) , ignoring all affiliated countries , represent 62 % of the world 's economy . 
  russia just dropped below spain and is now about 1.5 % , heading downwards . 
  dugin 's got his work cut out for himself . 
   but only 14 per cent said they had avoided getting onto a bus or a train because of those worries in the last three months . 
  14 % of germans avoided getting onto a bus or train because of terrorism worries in the last 90 days ? 
  if true , why could n't someone invest abroad , like in argentina ? 
  if you had a harvard source that argues that turkey has great potential , would that change your mind ? 
  i bet that harvardites have also written positive things about turkey . 
   today , vladimir putin appears to be courting that very same status , but in a profoundly different way , regarding russian-based organized crime abroad not as a threat or an embarrassment but a potential opportunity . 
  what evidence supports this ? 
   people choose to work themselves to death in sweatshops ... yes . 
  people in china came from the farms to the cities because a better life awaited them there . 
  it 's not as nice as that in europe , no , as there was initially a tremendous supply of labor and few slots , but factories have steadily opened up and [ wages and the standard of living risen ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=chinawag&amp;v=201606141716n&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) . 
   occasionally , they choose to throw themselves off the roof of the nearest foxcon building , too . 
  yes , people have occasionally committed suicide . 
  they do so in every country in the world , and nobody calls suicides slaves . 
  i do n't think that the republican party seeks to punish democratic voters , or that the democratic party seeks to punish republican voters . 
  i think that the two have some interests that conflict , but there 's no creation of pain for the purpose of creating pain . 
  and while i 'm less-familiar with the uk , i 'm skeptical that parties in the uk would do this either . 
  it would be counterproductive in every way -- nobody is going to switch their vote to vote for the other party because of fear of being `` punished '' . 
  i personally think that brexit is an bad idea for the uk and i think that the referendum reflected both a poorly-designed ballot that merged all leave possibilities and that the electorate voted with a poor understanding of the implications . 
  i would personally be delighted if the uk managed to back out of leave , either in effect or entirely . 
  however , this article is abysmal . 
  slicing and dicing the article , most of it is going to do precisely nothing to convince anyone :  in the days after the brexit vote , a favourite taunt of leavers was to tell those who were warning of the difficulties of brexit that such critics were `` in denial '' and were indulging in `` wishful thinking '' . 
  brexit meant brexit and it was now inevitable . 
  but it is now evident that it is the brexiteers who are denying the challenges of reality and wishfully thinking away the problems they now face . 
  divisive , unlikely to convince anyone , us-versus-them . 
   the canadian diplomat jeremy kinsman has a scathing phrase for the predicament of the pro-brexit uk government . 
  the brexiteers , the former high commissioner to the uk and ambassador to the eu , observed , `` are the dog that caught the bus : they had n't thought what to do next '' . 
    the uk government does not know what to do about brexit . 
  this is not a rhetorical exaggeration , it is a statement of fact . 
  as the foreign affairs parliamentary select committee reported recently ( paragraph 19 ) :   `` the previous government 's considered view not to instruct key departments including the [ foreign and commonwealth office ] to plan for the possibility that the electorate would vote to leave the eu amounted to gross negligence . 
  it has exacerbated post-referendum uncertainty both within the uk and amongst key international partners , and made the task now facing the new government substantially more difficult . ''   ( the committee , at paragraph 17 , also generously adopted the view of this blog that it is not so much that the uk government does not have a plan for brexit -- it does not even know what is to go into a plan . ), 
    the scale of the brexit task ahead is becoming plain , even if there is still shapelessness in policy . 
  a criticism of the leave campaign but not brexiting itself . 
  i think that the latter is what is probably interesting to everyone other than people who have a personal beef with those involved with the leave campaign . 
   ** many would say ** the job is impossible , at least in the short to medium term . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weasel_word  take for example the need for an exit agreement with the eu . 
  in the memorable example of gus o\u2019donnell , former cabinet secretary and head of the civil service : greenland , population less than croydon , one issue -- fish , and it still took three years for it to leave what was then the eec . 
  there is no sensible reason to believe that the uk could extract itself from the eu ( a more complex entity than the eec ) in the two years envisaged by article 50 . 
  it would probably make arrangements unofficially , whether article 50 wants it or no , and have an official process in which these are formalized . 
  the short two-year period can not realistically be viewed as a barrier that could hold a country in . 
   `` i wrote article 50 , so i know it well , '' amato told a conference in rome , saying he had inserted it specifically to prevent the british from complaining that there was no clear cut , official way for them to bail out of the union . 
    `` my intention was that it should be a classic safety valve that was there , but never used . 
  it is like having a fire extinguisher that should never have to be used . 
  instead , the fire happened . '' that may be true , but his intent will be of little interest . 
  rather , to a brexiteer , it is only a sign that british entry was obtained via dishonest pretext . 
   another person claiming credit for article 50 ( you would think no one would want to admit to authoring the provision ) is the british diplomat lord kerr . 
  he explains that it was inserted into the lisbon treaty as a sop to the eurosceptic media . 
  not only that , i find that personally-unconvincing to treat this as a nothing . 
  i think that countries would probably * not * have been willing to join the eu without the existence of article 50 . 
  joining a union that can not be left is a very different thing from joining a union that can . 
  acquiring us statehood , for example , is very probably a one-way road , and territories do not choose lightly to take it . 
  those who created the text lowered the bar to eu acceptance , but are also bound to accept that their offer might be exercised until such time as members collectively agree to remove that offer ( which i suspect * will * happen one day , or at bare minimum the bar raised ) . 
   regardless of who wrote the provision , no one can say that it provides a feasible process : the departing member state may have the immense advantage of setting the timing of the notification ; but then the see-saw reverses dramatically , giving the remaining member states a near-absolute advantage in negotiating position . 
  any extension of the two-year period can not be taken for granted , and so unless an agreement can be reached in less than two years , the member state is ejected . 
  it would be a weird and unworkable way to deal with a complex negotiation of the nature required . 
  article 50 may have `` worked '' as a work-around negotiation ploy for amato and kerr but it does not work as a legal framework . 
  that may have been the attempt . 
  i do not think that a diplomat who had the desire to do so could not work around it . 
  it is probably possible to obtain , via hook or crook , effective assurance of terms before initiating article 50 . 
   this is why any brexit may perhaps be by a new treaty rather than by the unfit-for-purpose article 50 . 
  but this would create new problems . 
  most notably , it could require a fresh referendum in the uk . 
  it would also need unanimity by the remaining member states . 
  there may be reasons for another referendum at some point -- in my eyes , putting the actual terms that davis or whoever is able to obtain and their direct consequences to the public -- to the public to see whether they actually want it and its consequences in preference to remain . 
  if the mood is comparable to the mood now , my belief is that that vote would be remain . 
  however , i have an extraordinarily hard time believing that the article 50 's design warrants another referendum . 
  i have a very hard time believing that the british electorate would buy into this , either . 
  that information was available to the voters at the time of the referendum . 
   then there are the international trade agreements that the brexiteers say the uk should enter with the rest of the world . 
  there are many difficulties here . 
  the uk has no trade negotiators ; the rest of the world will want to see what the uk-eu arrangement is before committing to a trade deal ; and britain has a weak and needy negotiating position . 
  such negotiation is as hard-headed an exercise as one can imagine , and the inexperienced uk ministers and officials will be lambs wandering into a slaughterhouse . 
  irrelevant .
