  whatever erdogan 's flaws , there was almost a military takeover of a democratically-elected government . 
  there were going to be arrests . 
  there was also going to be emergency moves to ensure that the government was stable . 
  that much would have happened an eu country or in the us in the event of a near-military takeover of the government . 
  hell , [ france has had ongoing emergency powers ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/10/french-mps-to-vote-on-controversial-changes-to-constitution ) and has n't had anything remotely like that kind of threat to the continued existence of the government in place . 
  now , i 'll grant , erdogan may very well be trying to strip political opposition from power as a convenience . 
  and yeah , the military might be more secular than his government and easier to sympathize with to that extent . 
  but i bet that if the military was islamist and erdogan were secular , you 'd be hearing a lot more cries of outrage over the coup attempt . 
   people just plain do n't understand that the revenue on a car is close to 0 . 
  revenue is the money before input costs are taken out , profit the money after input costs are taken out . 
  [ this link ] ( https://www.quora.com/on-average-how-much-profit-should-a-car-manufacturer-get-by-selling-one-car ) gives about 5 % net profit . 
  in all fairness , the rooskies have the largest ones ( though if ukraine joins the eu , the production capacity will be in the eu ) .

   nonetheless , ** in recent years ** , the kremlin has distinctively increased its support for populist and euroskeptic groups , be it in the form of a loan to marine le pen 's national front from a russian-czech bank or in the form of extremely benevolent media coverage by russia 's international state broadcaster of nigel farage 's uk independence party or the scottish independence movement in 2011 . 
  eh , ron paul ( not populist , but highly skeptical of the international order ) was getting lots of favorable airtime from rt and chinese state-run international broadcasters years back . 
  i particularly-enjoyed watching an attractive young chinese lady doing an interview -- funded by what is at least * nominally * a single party communist state -- enthusiastically agreeing as paul went on about the merits of * laissez-faire * markets and how having government involved in the economy was an evil of the highest degree . 
  not a new phenomenon . 
  look , putin 's got * some * name recognition over here , but he 's no johnny depp , you know ? 
  you got ta add the mental cues for the b-list celebrities . 
  shut down my investment opportunities in the ever-growing market for islam in france ? 
  leave it only open to domestic investment ? 
  [ the wto shall hear of this !, 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/agreement_on_trade-related_investment_measures ), 
  yes , on that point i am sympathetic -- i think that it 's probably best to have a well-defined and attainable goal to work for . 
  that being said , there were existing standards to meet in the past that were intended to do this for accession , and it was clearly possible to game them . 
  there 's also political viability with the public of germany and company . 
  publicly commit to recognizing losses , and even if they were inevitable , it looks like you handing over even more of the german public 's money to greece . 
  not to you personally . 
  if you read the the [ complete quote ] ( http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/28/james-comey-fbi-director-warns-of-terrorist-diaspo/ ) , it 's referring to an increase relative to the current level . 
  he 's saying that right now , people are fighting in the middle east for isis and losing . 
  at some point , they 're going to lose . 
  when that happens , there 's risk of them packing off to europe and trying to create mayhem there . 
   for instance , america has a higher gdp than france . 
  that 's an absolute metric . 
  growth in gdp is a relative metric -- this does n't compare france to the us , but france to france of yesterday . 
  re : defense of the us on some of these :  america also has unlimited money in politics , it keeps money in politics official and measurable . 
   the death penalty , i 'm fine with it myself , but even if one is not , i 'd claim that it plays a very minor role in the justice system . 
   private prisons i 'm fine with that -- harness the market , just as in other areas . 
  one company does a bad job , it loses its contract to someone else . 
  criticize the company , not the use of the market . 
  you can have a bad implementation , but that 's not unique to the private sector -- there have been plenty of public prisons that have had issues . 
   much higher student debt , i do think that people probably spend more than they should on certain name-brand educations . 
  we may do something wrong there . 
  i also think that education in general should be more automated and computer-driven , more wikipedia and less lecture hall , and be cheaper and more efficient . 
  but that is common to all countries , and i believe that we 've been a leader in [ trying to do something about it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massive_open_online_course ) . 
  the general principle of having people pay for their education is not one that i object to . 
  there should perhaps be some subsidy to reflect the positive [ externalities ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/externality ) of education to society as a whole , and we do do that via various mechanisms . 
  however , the primary beneficiary of higher education is the person being educated . 
  people who receive a bachelor 's make , even factoring in the cost of education and the time investment , an average of half a million dollars more over their lifetime than do those who do n't go to university . 
  they are significantly better-off . 
  to have someone else pay for the education would be a regressive policy , making the poorer give even more money to the wealthier . 
  ( standard note : the above half million dollar number just shows correlation and not causation . ), 
  sub-replacement fertility issues do n't go away just because the uk voted to leave the eu . 
  people get violent and take matters into their own hands when they feel that the government is n't doing anything . 
  yeah , you could enforce a ban , but then you 've got even more pissed-off people and you 're tying down policing resources on them . 
  the us used a similar approach in establishing its [ civilian conservation corps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilian_conservation_corps ) during the great depression . 
  instead of providing handouts and then trying to limit and restrict hordes of young men with nothing to do , they absorbed them into a paramilitary organization that was structured to avoid trouble under the control of the military reserves . 
  they addressed the core complaint ( then lack of the basics , now a way to let furious individuals deal with terrorism ) , avoided crime , and redirected the frustration to something that the country can get good out of . 
  concealed carry people will . 
   if you listen to erdogan speeches you will realize how much he despises the west . 
  foreinstance he said we `` love to kill muslim babies '' and recently launched his africa investment tour with multiple shameless references to western slave trade and racism and how much better turkey is and they want equal partners . 
  [ the west has a low level of contemporary slavery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery#/media/file:modern_incidence_of_slavery.png ) . 
  but some of that is presumably targeted to the audience . 
  happens to some degree in every country -- you 're going to speak kindly of a country when there . 
  no , there are no fundamental reasons for it , unlike a hard border with customs , which will suck for ireland . 
  there are some good reasons that are n't fundamental . 
  erdogan is n't the one protesting . 
  burning is [ also the preferred way to dispose of one at the end of its life ] ( http://wikihow.com/dispose-of-a-damaged-american-flag ) . 
  context is relevant . 
  huh . 
  on which points ? 
  i doubt that the debt would have been simply outright forgiven in any event . 
  other eu members have no way to force through reforms in greece other than via doling out debt relief a spoonful at a time . 
  give up that debt and the lever vanishes . 
  greece made promises in the past that were n't kept to . 
  the eu itself has no power to require privatization or cutting government spending . 
  greece is n't going to turn over control of its spending . 
  so it 's probably going to be incremental debt relief for a long time . 
  whether or not the degree of austerity is optimal might be arguable , but i ca n't imagine simply seeing germany and france writing everything off and taking greece 's word that * this * time things would be different . 
  some people in probably every eu member encouraged asylum claims . 
  france was asking for the patriotic members of the public to sign up . 
  remember that the government is having to worry not only about violence from islamic terrorism , but also reactionary violence from nationalist groups . 
  might be that this helps preempt right-wing paramilitary groups not under state control * a la * the sa from forming , since the state will have already taken everyone in the available pool . 
  no groups of people roaming around curb-stomping immigrants that they think look suspicious . 
  does the eu share asylum application fingerprints yet , at least ? 
  maybe . 
  how much of that is just phrasing , though ? 
  do n't you talk about an age range as a cohort sometimes ? 
  the broader point that the sample size is almost-completely disconnected from the population size is the important bit , though . 
  even aside from the fact that saudi arabia 's leadership is friendly , that 'd be pretty counterproductive . 
  do you deal with irish terrorism by bombing the vatican ? 
  i 'm no objectivist , but i do n't see any way in which it requires humans to act exceptionally . 
  hell , rand 's own novels were of a world with very imperfect people . 
  that 's probably * deutsche welle * 's phrasing , not turkey 's diplomatic phrasing . 
  were that the case , breaking the glass as shown would n't have any purpose . 
  i have n't been in the eu , but i 'd bet that fire safety standards in any developed country require letting doors open from the inside without a key . 
  minor point from the picture : you 'd think that sledging the glass on one side and ramming the glass on the other would just cause unnecessary damage . 
  all they 're needing to do is break in one pane so that they can reach in and open it . 
  i read up on it a bit . 
  apparently catalonia is wealthier and is unhappy with the amount of money pulled out to the rest of the country .
