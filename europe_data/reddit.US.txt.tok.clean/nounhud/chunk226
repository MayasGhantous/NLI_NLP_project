  that did n't work very well for brexit . 
  joining the eu is not a transfer of power , because parliament retains the ability to violate eu rules . 
  the eu might impose penalties for that , but that 's disconnected from the structure of the uk . 
  for a * reducto ad absurdum * , via your reading , every treaty the uk signed would violate parliamentary sovereignty . 
  usoe rather than usoe . 
  if you rent : * you 're insulated from losses in the rises and falls in the real estate market . 
  you want housing , you pay for it . 
  sure , you 're insulated from gains too , but historically ( at least in the us ) [ real estate has been a pretty lousy investment ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424052702304259304576375323652341888 ) . 
  you 're better-off putting money that would go toward buying a house and paying interest on a loan into the stock market , which produces much more favorable long term gains . 
  * you retain better labor mobility . 
  it 's cheaper to move if a better job shows up . 
  * you have fewer eggs in one basket . 
  buying real estate is a bet that demand relative to available housing supply will rise . 
  when an area goes into economic decline , demand for housing also tends to fall ... at the same time as companies tend to go under and lay people off . 
  you do n't want to lose your income at the same time that the value of your largest asset collapses . 
  * you limit risk . 
  one of the arguments i 've heard for buying real estate is that it lets you make a wildly-leveraged investment -- nothing else lets a typical person make such large bets with such a high proportion of borrowed money . 
  that means larger potential gains . 
  true , but wildly-leveraged investments also mean that you eat magnified losses when the market goes downhill . 
  if residential real estate were a fantastic investment , lenders would be buying that real estate themselves , not giving the money to homebuyers and stupidly watching the homeowner scoop up the gains . 
  there are some positive externalities to homeownership -- if people care about their neighborhoods due to financial interest , they 'll be less-likely to trash them . 
  on the other hand , there are also negative externalities , like insane hoa restrictions to guard what people think is house value . 
  not sure if that 's crossed the atlantic . 
  germany is notable for having a society that has a relatively high level of renting -- and functions well . 
  i have wondered whether we 'd be better off as a country with a more germany-like housing situation . 
  i once saw a ( us ) national association of realtors brochure that simultaneously claimed that it was the best time to both buy * and * sell . 
  huh , i did not know that . 
  to be fair , while some states do execute a fair number of people , it 's quite uncommon for the federal government to do so . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_punishment_by_the_united_states_federal_government  since 1963 , three people have been executed by the federal government of the united states . 
   speaking last week , erdo\u011fan vowed to approve the reinstatement of capital punishment if turkish parliament , controlled by his justice and development party ( akp ) , voted to pass such a measure . 
  the policies would hurt turkey 's ties with washington and brussels . 
  i can see why brussels might object , but i do n't see why we would on that particular point . 
   if us courts reject his request for gulen 's extradition , erdo\u011fan will certainly blame the white house . 
  subsequently , the turkish leader will have two options . 
  first , he may link the extradition issue to anti-isis co-operation . 
  if turkey were to present the us with an ultimatum , this would backfire , and the us would move its anti-isis operations from turkey to mediterranean aircraft carriers and persian gulf bases . 
  alternatively , erdo\u011fan could retaliate by simply pulling the plug on anti-isis co-operation with washington . 
  in both cases , us-turkish ties will rupture . 
  it does seem like a plausible scenario . 
  another possibility might be that gulen is actually extradited . 
  or that he is not personally-responsible for the coup , that erdogan 's real concern is gulen being behind the coup and not just cleaning house and that the us can look into this and that an investigation can turn up enough material to satisfy the turkish government . 
  that 's three big suppositions , though , and it will be a source of conspiracy theory with the public no matter what . 
  well , rt has a high bullshit level -- i mean , they do n't just do topic selection to highlight things that they 'd like to highlight , but promote stuff like the ukranian fighter jet mh17 shootdown conspiracy . 
  that being said , regardless of where the bar is drawn , it is certainly legitimate to point out that qatar controls al jazeera . 
  hell , i would n't mind all links being tagged with the state that controls them .

  we were growing with europe until 2006 , but we deflated in the bubble collapse that started then . 
  europe mostly just kept going up . 
  note also that except in germany ( which has quite low homeownership ) , prices against rents have skyrocketed in europe . 
  this probably means that many people are buying houses in europe when they should be renting . 
  debt can not be inherited ( though it comes out of any estate before inheritance ) in the united states . 
  i am almost certain that this is near-universal among other countries as well . 
  in practice , do people just ignore their outstanding debt , then , even if it remains officially on the books ? 
  are wages garnished or something ? 
  i 'm increasingly-interested in bankruptcy and debt laws in europe ever since i learned a some months back that they 're quite different in the us and europe -- in europe , depending somewhat on the country , it 's substantially-harder to shed debt in a bankruptcy or similar situation . 
  the obvious concern with easier-to-shed-bad-debt would be that it would make interest rates on loans higher , but i was reading a paper that investigated this and found that there actually was n't much difference in rates between the two ( though perhaps there were just other factors that canceled each other out -- the paper did n't investigate that ) . 
  what all is going on there ? 
  `` screw you russia , you are n't taking our law code '' ? 
  http://www.hindecapital.com/blog/uk-mortgage-rates-the-slow-drift-higher-and-the-impending-danger-for-uk-house-prices/  unlike the us , most mortgages in the uk are not non-recourse ; therefore banks have a claim on a borrower for any shortfall arising from the sale of a repossessed property . 
  thus , the bubble pop presumably wo n't clobber the banks the way it did in the us , where a lot of people simply walked away from their underwater mortgages , but it will leave people with their assets tied up in british real estate in bad personal financial shape , especially if they bought at really elevated prices or borrowed against them . 
  note that the [ canucks are in a similar position to the brits ] ( http://www.macleans.ca/economy/a-housing-market-thats-too-hot-to-handle/ ) . 
  their banking system might be stable , but canucks wo n't be happy . 
  starting hydrodynamic wars in a continent with the dutch seems like trouble .

  to be fair , in the united states , the [ * posse comitatus * act ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/posse_comitatus_act ) prohibits use of federal military in a law-enforcement capacity barring shit-has-hit-the-fan scenarios . 
  that was the ottoman empire . 
  the closest thing to the ottoman empire left today is turkey , which is n't sponsoring these attacks . 
  automated cell phone and other data-mining . 
  i am starting to want a better term than `` west '' . 
  the term is something of a relic . 
  that 's not to say that it does n't get meaning across , but ... 
  i think that most people would agree that china is `` east '' and the uk is `` west '' . 
  is australia west ? 
  is austria ? 
  is poland ? 
  is russia ? 
  guam ?

  texas was n't unrecognized . 
  it was an independent country for nine years , then joined the us ( then unsuccessfully seceded sixteen years after that ) . 
   let 's accept that we have walking killing machines amongst us humans are the planet 's [ apex predator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apex_predator ) , yes , even if we do n't normally bother to go killing ourselves , yes . 
  some of them are also suicide attacks . 
  like any other threat , these can be mitigated , given time and work , but historically , a lot of our mechanisms for dealing with attacks relied on people not being willing to die to pull it off . 
  this going to involve russia leaving ukraine ? 
  like ... you know , estonia ? 
  [ united states constitution , section 10 , clause 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_one_of_the_united_states_constitution#clause_1:_contracts_clause ) :  no state shall enter into any treaty , alliance , or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ; make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts ; pass any bill of attainder , ex post facto law , or law impairing the obligation of contracts , or ** grant any title of nobility ** . 
  ... would be a problem with that . 
  barring a constitutional amendment , the us ca n't have monarchies as states . 
  you could force europe into a union with the uk !, 
  germany is the target because it 's wealthy and there 's an opportunity to get better wages there . 
  it does n't have the strictest immigration policy compared to what it could , true , but that 's not the primary reason for germany being at the epicenter . 
  you might want to specify that you do n't want a globalresearch.ca article as source . 
   the woman had been diagnosed with the virus in may and had decided to keep the baby , a spokeswoman for the regional health authorities of catalonia , where the baby was born , told reuters .
