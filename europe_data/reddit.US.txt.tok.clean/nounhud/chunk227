  the primary goal is n't to have fancy lighting , but to ensure that the details of the sim on whatever people are being trained in conforms to the model .

  huh , [ you 're right ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/montreux_convention ) :  ( 1 ) the aggregate tonnage which non-black sea powers may have in that sea in time of peace shall be limited as follows :   ( a ) except as provided in paragraph ( b ) below , the aggregate tonnage of the said powers shall not exceed 30,000 tons ;   ( b ) if at any tine the tonnage of the strongest fleet in the black sea shall exceed by at least 10,000 tons the tonnage of the strongest fleet in that sea at the date of the signature of the present convention , the aggregate tonnage of 30,000 tons mentioned in paragraph ( a ) shall be increased by the same amount , up to a maximum of 45,000 tons . 
  for this purpose , each black sea power shall , in conformity with annex iv to the present convention , inform the turkish government , on the 1st january and the 1st july of each year , of the total tonnage of its fleet in the black sea ; and the turkish government shall transmit this information to the other high contracting parties and to the secretary-general of the league of nations ; to put that in perspective , given the massive growth over time of ships in a given size category , that currently amounts to just over two us [ * zumwalt * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zumwalt-class_destroyer ) - class destroyers . 
  i wonder if there should be some form of spending among other embargo members to support finnish agriculture . 
  even if the embargo is intended to be a long-term thing , there 's a substantial shock present that could be eased down . 
  i mean , for finland , the embargo is a big deal : http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/fin/ russia is the third-largest export partner and the second-largest import partner . 
  for portugal , russia is mostly-irrelevant : http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/prt/ ditto for the us : http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/usa/,

  the term is n't a formal one . 
  where there are [ small powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/small_power ) , [ middle powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/middle_power ) , and [ great powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_power ) , the uk is a great power . 
   the formalization of the division between small powers [ 12 ] and great powers came about with the signing of the treaty of chaumont in 1814 . 
  since then , the international balance of power has shifted numerous times , most dramatically during world war i and world war ii . 
  in literature , alternative terms for great power are often world power [ 13 ] or major power , [ 14 ] but these terms can also be interchangeable with superpower . 
  just a reminder : the maps that show a bit of mexico and canada are maps of the united states . 
  [ north america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_america ) is larger -- central america is part of north america .

  i am suspicious that new technologies that affect society are often seen as causing moral decay . 
  neither the eu nor the us was pushing to go to war in ukraine . 
  both merkel and obama stated that the solution was nonmilitary . 
  romanians show up in the uk -- they 're functioning , mostly via learning english . 
  they can work in romania or in the uk , and if it 'd make the british public happy to have 'em working in romania ... < shrug  you 'd probably wind up with companies facilitating this sort of thing fairly quickly . 
  if it 's that much difficulty , some companies are probably more amenable than it to others , so they can trade credits . 
  ask abraham lincoln ? 
  i can understand all but the last point . 
  as long as housing prices are above the cost of construction , british construction companies can build up . 
  it 's only regulation that would stop them doing so . 
  would you support temporary migration controls if they were paired with policies that would develop business in romania ? 
  like , a `` any business over fifty people may only increase payroll in the uk if they increase payroll by a comparable amount in < list of target countries  . '', 
  downside would be slower integration . 
  upside would be not hollowing out the populations of those countries and encouraging cross-state business ties . 
  both would tend to produce wage convergence . 
  what if policies were adopted that would ensure british businesses would set up shop in , e.g. 
  poland , with a total pay delta comparable to that that they 'd achieve in the uk , or with the uk funding business investments to produce the same in terms of polish businesses ? 
  i mean , that would address the real concern in poland , which is convergence of wages , right ? 
  it 'd take pressure off brits feeling overwhelmed . 
  if that were a temporary policy , it would n't have a permanent impact on equality , and it might tide the brits over . 
  i mean , you can move businesses or people . 
  it does n't have to be people .

  coal 's still there , just labor requirements for mining have fallen off . 
  hmm . 
  what 's your end goal for the uk ? 
  like , where would you want to see it , if you 'd prefer it not to have the london finance industry ? 
  hmmm . 
  is that just v4 ? 
  is n't that a legit complaint ? 
  i dunno ... it 's seemed to me that sometimes people are too ready to reference a country 's past in trying to create an explanation for whatever they 're doing . 
  there 's no decentralization process going on in the us that i 'm aware of . 
  spain 's been around for a long time . 
  i 'd be surprised if it abruptly , now , went down the drain . 
  the german-language article is summarizing [ this * the register * english-language article ] ( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/20/navy_software_pirates ) , which may be more accessible to english-speakers .

   he did n't make nato membership conditional . 
  he made article 5 conditional . 
  you 're misunderstanding what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm saying that if the cost were an issue , it would be addressed via withdrawing from nato , so that the us would n't be faced with credibility loss on not acting on article 5 . 
  it is unlikely that even if he were elected , this would happen . 
  the public does n't support it , and the bureaucracy does n't support it . 
  trump has made many comments , and is interested in politicking based on his image ; this gets high visibility here because nato is important in europe . 
  [ this is the list of trump 's actual issues ] ( https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions ) -- these are things that he could be counted to act on if elected ( and for a presidential general election candidate , this is * very * sparse already ) . 
  you 'll notice that nothing other than us-china trade reform shows up in terms of foreign policy ( and that if you actually look at the specifics , trump is promising almost nothing in concrete terms ) . 
  trump will say whatever vague things , however diplomatically-unacceptable or politically-unacceptable they might be , he thinks will help build that image . 
  if he seriously planned on this , it would not consist of some offhand comments made that clearly did n't involve someone familiar with nato 's structure looking into it . 
  for context , here 's [ trump on h1-b skilled work visas ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/21/donald-trump-flip-flops-then-flips-and-flops-more-on-h-1b-visas/ ) . 
  trump makes a lot of comments ; these do n't reflect some sort of planned policy . 
  not gon na happen even if he 's elected . 
  does n't make geopolitical sense . 
  even in a world where the us did do so , it 'd be via a nato withdrawal . 
  there would n't be an announcement `` we have the goal if stalling out brexit '' were that the goal anyway . 
  it 'd be politically counterproductive . 
  i saw one article on an iranian media source , with nothing else supporting it . 
  frankly , that 's just to favor the incumbents . 
  a better political goal might be to reduce the threshold to 1 % or so . 
  looking after member interests is a goal . 
  punishment is a mechanism . 
  they 're not mutually exclusive . 
  if you want to get the uk to possibly reverse brexit , which is what the article said , it might make sense to refuse a favorable offer . 
  i do n't think that that will work unless the uk 's leadership is colluding . 
  if you want to keep other members from leaving , i think that trying to actively make the uk do poorly is an extremely bad idea . 
  first , it 's immediately transparent to other members what 's going on -- it does n't say `` you 're better off in the eu '' , but `` i 'm going to club you if you leave '' . 
  that 's more fragile , since then they just need to hook up with someone else to make their exit . 
  second , it 's going to antagonize the hell out of people in the uk . 
  heck , blame-the-eu would be a thing anyway , but now it 'll be worse . 
  and while some people in the / r/ukpolitics seem to have an overinflated idea of relative uk stability and economic clout , you 're still talking about a major world economy and military power ( who , i might add , is a significant chunk of the eu 's military clout ) . 
  it 's a bigger economy than russia , but it 's also a neighbor .
