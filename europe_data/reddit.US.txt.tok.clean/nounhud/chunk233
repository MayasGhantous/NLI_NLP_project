  i am kinda curious what the concern is with schengen . 
  it ca n't be concerns about major competition , since that 's freedom of movement and already available . 
  i 'd think that it would have to be smuggling of some sort , since that 's all border control really buys . 
  drugs , maybe ? 
  or maybe non-romanians coming in through romania ? 
  also , if you do n't mind me asking ... what is the appeal to romania in visa-free access ? 
  i mean , the `` overstay visa and work under the table '' concern seems pretty straightforward to me . 
  i do n't seem to really understand the vehemence on the other side , though . 
  what is it that is so critical to romania about visa free access ? 
  to me , it just seems like a convenience -- nice , but not a radically important thing . 
  is it that it is a status symbol ? 
  i mean , i see people on here talking proudly about the `` strength '' of their passport . 
  is it that it is a route to work illegally , and people want a shot at doing so , because work visas to canada/the us are too restricted ? 
  is it that people want to work for businesses that require them to travel here on short notice ? 
  canada issues passports , rather than the provinces . 
  if the eu federalized , the same would be true of the eu . 
  if the eu took over the issuing of passports without federalization probably also true . 
  i should note that when [ st. kitts and nevis started selling citizenship ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/02/468953007/episode-687-buy-this-passport ) and all sorts of sketchy people were using that passport to get into the us , the us started requiring people to prove actual residence there above and beyond the passport . 
  do n't think that that would happen with the eu , but ... 
  that i could live with . 
  is the us doing this too ? 
  a lot of our visa policy is tied together . 
  to be fair , arguments for us-wide policy based on silicon valley are not very convincing unless we can produce other silicon valleys at will elsewhere in the us . 
  we do have other cities with tech industries , but not the same tech startup environment . 
  maybe us policy is a necessary factor for that , but it does n't seem to be sufficient on its own . 
  that topic comes up on here occasionally , since software development should be easily moved , silicon valley has expensive housing , and a lot of european countries would like to be more-significant in the field . 
  there have been a lot of proposed factors that do n't involve regulation -- language/market fragmentation , inertia of finance , etc. 
  the eu tends to have harsh ( to debtors ) bankruptcy law compared to the us , and i have wondered if that might be a factor in reducing business risk tolerance . 
  i certainly understand the population issue , but why would the political system be relevant ? 
  this subreddit needs a faq that contains a brief explanation of : * why the goal of trade is n't normally to try to maximize trade surpluses . 
  * what ` strength ' of a currency means and what its effects are and why the size of the base unit in each currency is n't interesting . 
  i 'm not the most-qualified person to write those up , but i see a lot of people advocating for policy based on what i 'd call a misunderstanding of one or the other . 
  heh , had not heard this term . 
  well , the eu has a large population in a similar timezone , is easy to travel to , has the same language , is developed , has low transport costs and short transport time , the uk 's economy is adapted to the needs if countries in the eu , and the uk already paid the price of regulatory standardization . 
  my guess is that the uk probably winds up better off trading with the eu , and i think that it 'd probably do best by finding a way around the referendum . 
   ... [ an estimated 75 percent of canadians live within 161 kilometers ( 100 miles ) of the u.s. 
  ] ( http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/countries/canada-facts/ ), 
  http://www.atlantic-community.org/-/is-the-european-union-more-precautionary-than-the-us - edit : i was actually intending to link to the study that this was based on , not the article , but this has a better synopsis anyway . 
  eh , if something like that happened and included the us , it would probably have the least impact on us . 
  australia 's 24m . 
  new zealand is 5m . 
  canada is 36m . 
  uk is 65m . 
  we 're 324m -- everyone else combined is only 40 % our population . 
  australia and new zealand [ already have this ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/trans-tasman_travel_arrangement ) , plus what is [ heading toward market integration ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/closer_economic_relations ) . 
  on the other hand , canada and us have never set anything like that up , even though we border each other . 
   trade that 's what tpp is , along with some other countries . 
  it 's not like the single market you have , though . 
  uk is n't in it , but it would be in ttip , and our trade lead was in the news talking about the uk joining tpp if you guys do n't work something out with the uk . 
   defense all members are either in nato or [ anzus ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/anzus ) , though nz has an anti-nuclear policy that has caused some friction with the us . 
  the real problem is just that the security concerns of the atlantic and pacific countries are n't that closely-connected . 
  it 's not the guy , but the harm it would do is to the security the us offers people on its soil . 
  plus a low-level insurgency inside the state , active military coup , and neighboring states overrun by a group devoted to overthrowing governments in the area . 
  i assume this is to ward off the domestic `` you do n't stand up to the us '' crowd , but it 's not very diplomatic . 
  sounds like he 's integrated well . 
  for google , i think that there are probably some legitimate antitrust issues . 
  google * is * trying to leverage existing services . 
  for greece ... i think that the politics have been handled badly there too , but they 're trying to reform economies that have serious problems , and do n't really have any levers to do it other than using debt relief as a choke collar . 
  you could think of this as giving money as a carrot to reform ... it 's just that the money was already ( improperly ) spent , so it looks like a stick . 
  on britain ... yeah , the delight some have expressed at the prospect of the uk getting burned rubs me the wrong way too , and i think of it as foolish . 
  but ... that 's mostly individuals , not officials . 
  i think that it 's mostly driven by fear of what it might mean for the eu -- frightened people are mean people . 
  and if you look at / r/ukpolitics , you can find at least as substantial a contingent of brits rubbing their hands at the prospect of an eu collapse ... and they appear to be largely driven by fear of germany somehow taking over , something which keeps coming up . 
  guess the germans paid attention to polish and french polls but were n't watching the brits ... you can find yanks doing the same thing . 
  look at the ` anyone supporting gulen is our enemy ' statement from the turkish pm and promptly a bunch of yanks feel threatened and are enthusiastically talking about how they could crush turkey . 
  that 's the only sane thing to say , whatever her goals . 
  he should have said ` security ' , not ` self-sufficiency ' . 
   as they should n't , the eu is our bitch . 
  you probably could have made the same points without ensuring that your post got downvoted by including that leading sentence . 
  i dunno about canada 's situation , but with the us , all other eu countries but bulgaria , romania , and poland have met the criteria of maintaining a low level of visa refusals . 
  poland is n't far off and will quite likely get in soon . 
  offhand comment , not on his issues page or a core point , nato has 77 % public approval in the us , would conflict radically with us interests , the bureaucracy would say no . 
  ai n't gon na happen . 
  i do n't think that the us is gon na bend on visas , but a nato breakup in a year would be very unlikely . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/4t6k7m/would_you_like_canada_to_join_the_eu/ responses so far : * us joint the eu ? 
  please no . 
  europe is going down the shitter . 
  * i said it there and i will say it here , fuck no . 
  * the other way around ... the eu should join canada * hell no . 
  we 're not part of europe so paying dues to and sitting in the european parliament and debating european laws , issues and regulations is wholly nonsensical . 
  the european union does have serious flaws ... yeah i guess it means i can move to new york / california for a job but it would be a seismic change to canada . 
  * do you know what eu stands for ? 
  we are not part of europe , nor are we at all similar . 
  in fact , as soon as brexit goes through , we will have even less in common with europe . 
  * hell no . 
  * lol . 
  ... and have all those eastern-euro toads coming here and taking every job and working for pennies on the dollar ? 
  ... and being ordered to take in tens of thousands of economic migrants ? 
  no f-ing way . 
  * i 'd prefer to have our trade deals negotiated by us and not some faction across the ocean . 
  * no , we are not in europe and are way different with the issues that affect us . 
  * that 's insane . 
  we would most certainly have to adopt the euro which alone outweigh any pros of joining the eu . 
  not to mention the massive loss of sovereignty . 
  * hell no !, 
  whatever for ? 
  * i supported brexit , so no . 
  europeans had a much higher quality of life before the formation of the eu . 
  * no * joining the eu will certainly not happen ... also as for the uk . 
  the referendum wasnt legally binding and they are basically in a situation where the subject of brexit will never actually be acted on this decade .
