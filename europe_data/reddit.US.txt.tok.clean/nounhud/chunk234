  i rather become another state of usa . 
  * unified monetary policy with each nation having their own fiscal policy with a unified currency ? 
  no thanks . 
  * i certainly find it hilarious that so many people here think brexit is a terrible idea but canada join the eu ? 
  no way !, 
  * just what we need , less autonomy . 
  * i do n't want bottom of the barrel immigrants from north africa and the middle east with the ability to travel here easily . 
  * putting another branch of government above our federal government will just make everything worse . 
  i 'm impressed . 
  you managed to make a horde of * canucks * be rude . 
  turkey is not planning to attack the us . 
  violence against someone in a truck running people down is one thing . 
  violence against everyone in the religion that this guy appears to be a lapsed member of is another . 
  china 's wall is visible from space . 
  * ours * will be visible from the moon !, 
  where in france are you planning to build this wall ? 
   on moment you had erdogan panicking and seeking asylum all over europe i have n't seen the asylum claims verified by a reputable source . 
  what 's undemocratic about romania and bulgaria ? 
   he sought for asylum in germany/uk that showed up on reddit . 
  it did not show up on mainstream news sources like cnn . 
  i strongly suspect that if this was n't simply a hoax , this was disinformation from someone supporting the coup . 
  this has been an exceptionally-good month for putin . 
  i can agree with the first point -- any coup government would n't have the support of the majority . 
  i do n't agree with you on the second . 
  even `` bloodless '' coups normally are n't completely bloodless . 
  coups involve some degree of violence . 
  side note : while the nazi party achieved power in significant part through a democratic system , the closest thing to `` electing hitler '' was probably [ the 1932 german presidential elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_presidential_election,_1932 ) , which hitler lost . 
  so your contention is that a state should always imprison people for life because of the possibility that someone would find out that the sentence is wrong ? 
  i 'm sorry , but if someone 's been in prison for fifty years , their life is gone . 
  it was done via them slowly rotting in a concrete box , but same thing . 
  if your justice system is making errors , * that * is what should be fixed . 
   i thought more in terms of germany , britain or france . 
  because lord knows , those three do n't have enough political problems at the moment before starting a european war among nato members . 
  turkey [ has a higher globalfirepower ranking than germany ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&amp;country1=germany&amp;country2=turkey&amp;submit=compare ) . 
  and what are you going to do afterwards ? 
  first , i guarantee you that while a lot of turks may not like erdogan , they sure as shit do n't want france , germany , or the uk invading . 
  second , turkey is islamist because a lot of people there want at least moderate islamism . 
  maybe not * quite * a majority , depending upon circumstances , but enough . 
  so , let 's say that your intervention goes off without a hitch . 
  now , what are you going to do ? 
  you going to give a democratic vote to people ? 
  you 're going to have erdogan 2.0 running things , with decidedly-more-pissed-off-people . 
  you going to make turkey some sort of eu client territory without a democracy to vote ? 
  * that 's * going to create a just-fantastic situation for the eu . 
  ask the brits how much fun it 's been to try to maintain colonial states . 
  third , while erdogan leans dictatorial , remember that some of that is because he 's putting down uprisings in his country , some of which * are n't * secular . 
  [ that 's also a chunk of the reason that he runs around saying the idiotic islam crap . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/16/muslims-discovered-america-erdogan-christopher-columbus ) you want to be responsible for that ? 
  you think that british brexit voters are trouble , you 've got a whole new world of uninformed-but-antagonistic-people pain to deal with . 
  fourth , if you wanted a russia-turkey alliance , you just bought yourself one . 
  military involvement is a potent tool , but that 's all it is -- a tool . 
  it 's not a `` make things better '' magic wand . 
  why ? 
  surely the regime is more stable today than it was two days ago ? 
   should n't we want them to get better and join us as a fully functional state ? 
  < coughs  implying that capital punishment makes a state not functional ? 
   of course they know that eu or us was behind this . 
  well , there 's no way to know for certain , i suppose , but i doubt that the us administration , or even moreso the eu administration , would do so . 
  they do n't stand in a position to benefit . 
  * for the eu in particular , destabilizing the one country whose stability is necessary to block the migrant crisis without the eu itself having to handle the migrants -- possibly the biggest political concern facing the eu -- would make no sense . 
  a civil war in turkey right now would be catastrophic for for the eu . 
  * even a successful coup 's backing would ultimately come out . 
  not only did the iranian coup wind up being a serious net negative , doing it to a friendly state would have been extraordinarily harmful to nato . 
  * erdogan ai n't perfect , but he 's running an allied state . 
  the only real issue people around here have with him is that he 's moderately-islamist ... and the us is happy working with saudi arabia and pakistan , which are way , way further down that line . 
  there 's just no substantial political benefit for either the us or the eu here , and there are major risks . 
  you have a protected market . 
  this is probably in not-insignificant part why you 've got farmers over there opposed to trade with the us . 
  genetic engineering is a process that can achieve the same genetic changes , just as artificial breeding does . 
  there are currently no restrictions on artificial breeding , so it seems very difficult to restrict genetic engineering . 
  it 's just that genetic engineering is a generally-more-efficient way of achieving the same outcome and aside from a few plants that are cloned everywhere , like haas avocados , it * is * the norm for genetic changes to show up in food . 
  i suppose that you could argue that the potential * rate * of change itself poses a concern , but then you 'd think that it 'd be possible to say , for example , `` more than n % of the genome changing requires a re-certification '' . 
  at the moment , this looks mostly like an effort to establish an ntb . 
  that being said ... while i am not convinced that it 's actually gulen , since my understanding is that erdogan has been blaming him for all sorts of things , erdogan does have a certain point . 
  let 's assume that this is n't just political propaganda , and that the coup * was * orchestrated by gulen , and that he is actually actively involved in attempting to overthrow the government remotely . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fethullah_g%c3%bclen  he is currently on turkey 's most-wanted terrorist list and is accused of leading what the current turkish officials call the gulenist terror organisation ( feto ) . 
  [ 22 ] [ 23 ] a turkish criminal court issued an arrest warrant for g\u00fclen . 
  [ 24 ] [ 25 ] turkey is demanding the extradition of g\u00fclen from the united states . 
  [ 17 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] however , so far there is no turkish court decision that charges g\u00fclen or his followers with any terrorist activity . 
  [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] september 11th was bloodier and more-clearly terrorism in the conventional sense , but the us clearly made an article 5 argument based on the fact that afghanistan was shielding terrorists who were attacking it and providing camps that was actively-training people to attack the us again . 
  while the second point is not applicable , the first would seem to be . 
  what * is * the appropriate , legally-consistent response in this case ? 
  where are the dividing lines ? 
  * gulen has not , as far as i know , applied for or received asylum . 
  * the us * has * provided sanctuary to various people who do support overthrowing governments around the world . 
  i do n't know of any criteria that they actively stop at least advocating for overthrow . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_invasion_of_afghanistan  u.s. president george w. bush demanded that the taliban hand over osama bin laden and expel al-qaeda , bin laden had already been wanted by the u.n. since 1999 . 
  the taliban declined to extradite him unless given what they deemed convincing evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks [ 4 ] and ignored demands to shut down terrorist bases and hand over other terrorist suspects apart from bin laden . 
  the request was dismissed by the u.s. as a meaningless delaying tactic and it launched operation enduring freedom on 7 october 2001 with the united kingdom . 
  that is , whether-or-not this is consistent , and whether-or-not gulen would be considered a terrorist by us criteria ( which may be doubtful ) , where * should * the line be ? 
  should people be able to organize coups in other countries ? 
  pro-democracy advocates for china certainly seek regime change in the prc , and there 's been no question that they should be shielded . 
  yeah ... i mean , if it 's true that he was actually behind the coup attempt . 
  i assume that this is from that frequently-cited free press index that requires government-funded media sources to count as `` free '' . 
  is it ? 
  it 'd be interesting to see what 's happened in past coups . 
  i 'd have expected that they 'd have just urged for peaceful resolution -- this was a much stronger position . 
  landing is fine , but starting your aircraft flying for an airport that was actually controlled by opposition forces seems like it 'd be a hell of a risk . 
   nobody in nato is going to help erdogan . 
  it 's an internal political affair .
