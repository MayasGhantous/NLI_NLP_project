  nato as a military force would be unlikely to get involved in any event -- it 'd harm nato as an organization . 
   why do n't they ever come when i 'm sober enough to understand them ? 
  imagine some guy who just went out for a beer , had downed several and was feeling pleasantly out-of-touch with the world , and then discovered himself in the middle of the [ beer hall putsch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beer_hall_putsch ) . 
  actually , that would make for kind of a cool movie . 
   edit 88 : pentagon sources briefing they expect the coup to fail . 
  what 's your source on that ? 
  this has been an extremely good month for putin , i do have to concede that , and that would certainly top things off . 
  obama and kerry have apparently already given statements saying that all parties in turkey should support the democratically-elected government . 
  the eu has apparently issued a weaker statement along the same lines . 
  that 's not a good sign for the coup -- the leadership did n't need to issue statements urging support one way or another . 
  however , there 's no surprise in that the mosques would support erdogan from the get-go , coup or no coup . 
   similar to christians ... well it is the same story after all . 
  no disagreement . 
   then you understand why they believe that . 
  no , i think that the us would have to have gone after the muslim countries out there for that to be a justified belief . 
  indonesia , albania , iraq ( whose government we 're currently supporting ) , turkey ( for whom erdogan government obama and kerry just expressed support ) , egypt , etc. 
  i do n't know what the majority view is . 
  i believe that * you * think that , and i think that that is an irrational belief . 
  it may be that even a lot of muslims think that . 
  certainly there are people with political motives who would like to promote that view . 
  why is that ? 
  i do n't think that the coup was because mosques supported erdogan . 
  you say that now , but wait until they take all your jobs . 
  on that note , trump just declared his running mate in the last few hours . 
   edit 90 : pentagon briefing that the coup was insufficiently organised : failed to capture erdogan and thus likely to fail . 
  i will believe that it 's likely to fail , but why is capturing him relevant ? 
  there have been plenty of coups that have succeeded when the leader flees . 
   and it 's what the vast majority of muslims think . 
  could be true , but i 'd say that that does n't matter . 
  muslims also think that there 's a sky fairy running the universe . 
   actions speak louder than words . 
  i agree . 
  if the united states had gone to war with islam , the world would look very different today . 
   they declared war on a religion nope , that 's not an accurate assessment . 
  we went after afghanistan ( people refusing to turn over the people that attacked the world trade center , pentagon , and tried to hit the capitol building ) and iraq . 
  in fact , people * here * seem to be more irked with saudi arabia than anyone i 've seen in the us . 
  could you clarify the significance ? 
  this is erdogan 's plane ? 
  miss europa . 
  ca n't marry a bull . 
  as far as i can tell from this forum , it 's a near-universal european characteristic . 
  internal affair . 
  that all seems pretty minor in comparison . 
  i mean , that required a brexit on your part too ... 
  not to mention the situation inside turkey . 
  gon na be awkward if his plane runs out of fuel over europe . 
  i bet that merkel was just thinking that this was a boring and quiet month and hoping for something to spice life up . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fethullah_g%c3%bclen he 's been operating out of the us for a couple of years . 
  if it is him . 
  i had n't even thought of that ... 
  seriously , there is a lot going on in europe these days . 
  that 's a reasonable response . 
  the problem you are facing is psychologically-coping with a very minor threat . 
  meanwhile , you have tax dollars paying for people to go monitor , arrest , and sometimes outright assassinate people associated with this . 
  lets say it was approachable and popular with the masses . 
  would n't make for much of a [ signalling mechanism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/signalling_\\ ( economics \\ ) ) for you being part of a particular social set . 
  same as knowing latin or being able to quote from and identify quotes from a canon of literature once was . 
  or even , if you expand the size of the group , things like not using profanity are today . 
  to be fair , while we did have centuries of advancement in making realistic , lifelike works , the cheap , fast , and perfect photograph kinda wiped out the bulk of the market . 
  did we read the same article ? 
  that 's not what this said . 
  it was re-focusing attention on the humanity of victims , which has been found to be an effective propaganda method to discourage attacks . 
  it mentioned that one was muslim , to show how counter-productive the attack was . 
  i do n't like the ones using blood as the red in the flag . 
  the flag symbolizes the country and things that it wants to stand for . 
  france wants to get rid of incidents like this . 
   second hollande uses government 's money ... french taxpayers pay for hollande 's haircuts ? 
  why ? 
   i only find it bad taste and bad style everyone knows what it means . 
  sure , the language is ambiguous there , but that 's what context is for , and there 's no issue of confusion . 
  why try to reinterpret it to mean something offensive ? 
   he said national security would remain at the highest level , with up 10,000 military personnel mobilised , and that reservists would be recalled for duty . 
    he also decided to extend for three months the state of emergency that was declared after the paris attacks last november and that was to have been lifted on 26 july . 
  [ snip ]  but several politicians have said these measures were inadequate . 
    francois fillon , a former center-right prime minister , said friday morning that the state of emergency was `` not enough '' and that authorities should `` use all intruments of [ france 's ] law ... to prevent attacks '' . 
  i suppose that france could also mobilize francois fillon to stand guard somewhere too . 
  woman creates derived artwork with better story than original , museum vandalizes . 
   it 's not so much a bad word now . 
  it was reappropriated a long time ago . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yankee_doodle  traditions place its origin in a pre-revolutionary war song originally sung by british military officers to mock the disheveled , disorganized colonial `` yankees '' with whom they served in the french and indian war . 
  the british troops sang it to make fun of their stereotype of the american soldier as a yankee simpleton who thought that he was stylish if he simply stuck a feather in his cap . 
  [ 1 ] [ snip ]  the earliest known version of the lyrics comes from 1755 or 1758 , as the date of origin is disputed : [ 16 ]    * brother ephraim sold his cow *     * and bought him a commission ; *     * and then he went to canada *     * to fight for the nation ; *     * but when ephraim he came home *     * he proved an arrant coward , *     * he would n't fight the frenchmen there *     * for fear of being devoured . 
  * [ snip ]  it was also popular among the americans as a song of defiance . 
  [ 1 ] as per the american library of congress , the americans added additional verses to the song , mocking the british troops and hailing the commander of the continental army george washington . 
  by 1881 , yankee doodle had turned from being an insult to being a song of national pride . 
  [ 13 ] [ snip ]  yankee doodle was also played at the british surrender at saratoga in 1777 . 
  [ 21 ] hundreds of years later , it 's still going strong :  the voice of america begins and ends all broadcasts with the interval signal of `` yankee doodle '' . 
  probably awkward in mandarin , too . 
   i 'm not against us appropriating europe the way the us has appropriated america , to be honest . 
  frankly , * you * guys are the ones that i see using `` america '' more than anything . 
  i tend to say `` the us '' . 
   britain did fight when disaster struck , unlike france . 
  every country , of which france is no exception , got severely slapped around the first time they fought against the germans in world war ii . 
  that [ includes the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_france ) and [ the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kasserine_pass ) and [ the soviet union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_barbarossa#phase_one ) . 
  furthermore , we [ had our asses handed to us in the philippines by the japanese at the get-go ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philippines_campaign_\\ ( 1941 % e2 % 80 % 9342 \\ ) ) , as [ did the brits in singapore ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_singapore ) . 
  the difference was that the uk and the us and the ussr enjoyed [ strategic depth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_depth ) and could fall back , figure out what they 'd screwed up , and have another stab at things . 
  france had one strike until they were out . 
  here 's a bit of [ french military history that you may enjoy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_camar%c3%b3n ) :  the battle of camar\u00f3n ( french : bataille de camerone ) which occurred over ten hours [ 1 ] :21 on 30 april 1863 between the french foreign legion and the mexican army , is regarded as a defining moment in the foreign legion 's history . 
  a small infantry patrol , led by captain jean danjou and lieutenants cl\u00e9ment maudet and jean vilain , numbering just 65 men [ 1 ] :5 was attacked and besieged by a force that may have eventually reached 3,000 mexican infantry and cavalry , and was forced to make a defensive stand at the nearby hacienda camar\u00f3n , in camar\u00f3n de tejeda , veracruz , mexico . 
  the conduct of the legion , who refused to surrender , led to a certain mystique -- and the battle of camar\u00f3n became synonymous with bravery and a fight-to-the-death attitude .
