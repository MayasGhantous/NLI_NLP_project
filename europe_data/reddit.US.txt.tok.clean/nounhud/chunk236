  i 'm not particularly familiar with the situation , but martel 's situation looks potentially not-quite-as-dire as perhaps it might have been considered : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_martel  in the modern era , matthew bennett argues that `` few battles are remembered 1,000 years after they are fought ... but the battle of poitiers , ( tours ) is an exception ... charles martel turned back a muslim raid that , had it been allowed to continue , might have conquered gaul . 
  '' [ 32 ] [ snip ]  it is important to note , however , that modern western historians , military historians , and writers , essentially fall into three camps . 
  the first , those who believe gibbon was right in his assessment that charles saved christianity and western civilization by this battle , as typified by bennett , paul davis , robert martin , and educator dexter b. wakefield , who writes in * an islamic europe ? * ... 
  [ snip ]  the second camp of contemporary historians believe that a failure by charles at tours could have been a disaster , destroying what would become western civilization after the renaissance . 
  certainly all historians agree that no power would have remained in europe able to halt islamic expansion had the franks failed ... [ snip ]  ** the final camp of western historians believe that the importance of the battle is dramatically overstated . 
  ** this view is typified by alessandro barbero , who writes , `` today , historians tend to play down the significance of the battle of poitiers , pointing out that the purpose of the arab force defeated by charles martel was not to conquer the frankish kingdom , but simply to pillage the wealthy monastery of st-martin of tours '' . 
  yes . 
  presumably because no newspaper places `` allegedly '' throughout its articles on each sentence . 
  the issue is n't in question . 
  one reasonable justification -- france may want to have a way to rapidly-spread instructions as quickly as possible . 
  for example , let 's say that some sort of gas bombs go off in a city , and the authorities send out an evacuation order to start clearing people as quickly as possible and to prevent people from attempting to head into the area . 
  however , in this case , there was no advisory that would have helped . 
  the us has always had such a mechanism , and i assume that france does too -- e.g. 
  a way to [ override all television broadcast systems with directions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emergency_broadcast_system ) or [ send mass alerts to all phones in an area ] ( https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/wireless-emergency-alerts-wea ) . 
  they do n't have very good logo design . 
  that small text is illegible . 
   he is either english or american . 
  he hates scotland and ireland . 
  ... what ? 
   she could constitutionally trigger article 50 without a second thought about sturgeon but that is n't a good idea . 
  she could constitutionally say `` that referendum was a bad idea and i 'm explicitly and immediately stating that we 're ignoring it '' , but that would n't be a politically-good way of dealing with things either . 
  that it has n't had weapons placed aboard at some point ? 
  that seems a difficult burden of proof to meet . 
  i mean , anything with any degree of space that is n't subject to public inspection at all times could in theory carry weapons . 
  the portuguese embassy in italy might , in theory , contain weapons . 
  there 's only a single , experimental one , doing so would violate a treaty , there are preferable delivery vehicles , and so forth -- but those are all just practical arguments . 
  i 'm not sure how you 'd * prove * that to someone who is convinced otherwise . 
  i expect that it comes out to about the same thing . 
  i hope that you 're not implying that this is some sort of conspiracy/false flag/whatever thing . 
  blood feuds are a very old type of justice . 
  there 's a reason we moved away from them . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feud  a feud / \u02c8fju\u02d0d / , referred to in more extreme cases as a blood feud , vendetta , faida , beef , clan war , gang war , or private war , is a long-running argument or fight , often between social groups of people , especially families or clans . 
  feuds begin because one party ( correctly or incorrectly ) perceives itself to have been attacked , insulted or wronged by another . 
  intense feelings of resentment trigger the initial retribution , which causes the other party to feel equally aggrieved and vengeful . 
  the dispute is subsequently fuelled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory violence . 
  this continual cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it extremely difficult to end the feud peacefully . 
  feuds frequently involve the original parties ' family members and/or associates , can last for generations , and may result in extreme acts of violence . 
  they can be interpreted as an extreme outgrowth of social relations based in family honor . 
    until the early modern period , feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments [ 1 ] and were regulated to some degree . 
  for example , serb culture calls this krvna osveta , meaning `` blood revenge '' , which had unspoken but highly valued rules . 
  [ 2 ] in tribal societies , the blood feud , coupled with the practice of blood wealth , functioned as an effective form of social control for limiting and ending conflicts between individuals and groups who are related by kinship , as described by anthropologist max gluckman in his article `` the peace in the feud '' [ 3 ] in 1955 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_punishment  collective punishment is a form of retaliation whereby a suspected perpetrator 's family members , friends , acquaintances , sect , neighbors or entire ethnic group is targeted . 
  the punished group may often have no direct association with the other individuals or groups , or direct control over their actions . 
  in times of war and armed conflict , collective punishment has resulted in atrocities , and ** is a violation of the laws of war and the geneva conventions ** . 
  historically , occupying powers have used collective punishment to retaliate against and deter attacks on their forces by resistance movements ( e.g. 
  destroying entire towns and villages where such attacks have occurred ) . 
   4 ) the complete distruction of all soviet style housing in every area of france . 
  the construction of new , more smaller housing spread around france . 
  we tried [ breaking up ghettos , without the successful results we 'd hoped for ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/american-murder-mystery/306872/ ) . 
   5 ) educating all people on the attrocities committed by the french and also by the algerians during the civil war . 
  what percentage of the people involved in the attacks have been algerians ? 
   make it clear that if a place breeds extremism , they either clean up their ranks or we remove the place alltogether . 
    which may backfire . 
  we 've gone [ out of the way to avoid destroying mosques ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuqovj8bbka ) . 
  that strategy was planned by at least some people who believe that it 's advisable to minimize the religious aspect . 
  fine . 
  if you want to say `` the economic policies of hollande suck '' or `` unemployment is too high '' , there i would in no way blame you -- that 's something that he can certainly be expected to address . 
  what frustrates me is that this is a horribly cheap shot to take at him . 
  if you go after him because somewhere in france , someone drove a truck into a crowd , what happens when * your * favorite candidate is in office and some jackass who does n't like him promptly waits for who-knows-what tragedy and then says `` this politician should go to * jail * because he failed to somehow foresee and prevent this '' . 
  you 'd be furious at someone trying to abuse the system to undermine the guy . 
  i can tell you that right now , in the world , there is probably no country -- maybe vatican city -- where it is impossible to drive a semi truck into a crowd of people . 
  if hollande is personally guilty of failing to be a good leader because of this one point , so is every other national leader out there -- putin and obama and cameron and all the rest of them . 
  look , i 'm from the us , and i 'm comfortable with police having rifles , but even a rifle of the sort that a police officer could reasonably carry -- and police are going to be hesitant to be shooting rifles in crowded streets , for obvious reasons -- is not going to easily disable a semi truck . 
  even gunshots wo n't typically kill someone immediately , especially pistol rounds , and all the guy has to do is remain conscious and keep his foot on the pedal . 
  the truck went two kilometers -- at 60 kph , that 's two minutes ? 
  there 's only so-quickly that someone can respond and understand what 's going on , and so many officers . 
  if it had n't been a semi truck , it could have been a vehicle loaded with explosives . 
  or a chemical truck could have been used . 
  a propane tank detonated . 
  accelerant and toxic chemicals dumped into a tunnel , like a subway tunnel , at two ends and lit to kill people on a train . 
  the list goes on and on and on . 
  is any one of these counterable ? 
  sure , and i am sure that the french police will look into addressing this in the future -- for at least political reasons , a year from now , this particular attack wo n't be possible at this location , maybe via concrete posts that can lower or something during celebrations . 
  and in the long run , maybe this particular * sort * of attack can be countered . 
  maybe we 'll move to only self-driving cars that can be disabled . 
  maybe someone will come up with some sort of clever gunshot-locating microphone with little computer-controlled turrets on buildings that can shoot gunmen . 
  every particular attack has some sort of theoretical counter , given enough resources . 
  but it is simply unrealistic to expect everything like this to be blocked . 
  there are too many avenues for terrorism to expect it to be impossible to engage in it . 
  and it seems monstrously-unfair to hold the guy personally-responsible . 
   the nra has blood on its hands and you disagree . 
  well , you 're right insofar as i disagree . 
   by preventing proper gun regulation `` proper '' is certainly a loaded term . 
  it 's not possible to convert a country into a padded cell , and firearms are hardly the most-effective way to engage in mass killings . 
   yes , our leaders and governments should be held accountable when innocent people die . 
  that 's what responsibility means . 
  you are arbitrarily -- i assume that you are politically opposed to the man , and see this as a route to politically-attack him -- selecting a particular national leader , saying `` something bad happened in this country '' , and saying that he should be placed in prison . 
  that is an unrealistic standard . 
  i do not happen to politically-agree with hollande , but he can not realistically be personally blamed for somewhere in france , someone driving a truck through a crowd of people . 
  you can not have a functioning country in which it is impossible for a dedicated person to kill people . 
  you may have a pretty good success rate . 
  you might take ever-more-extreme measures -- you could round up people even slightly at risk and put them in camps , or force people to wear monitoring bracelets , disallow private communication and have microphones everywhere , or heavens knows what -- but hollande had already been catching flak for going too far with his emergency measures . 
  if you had been raising some proposal which he 'd been ignoring , that would be different . 
  to simply say `` a tragedy happened , and i feel that blame must be assigned '' is ridiculous . 
  i 'm sure that there will be actions taken . 
  it might be possible to repeat this particular event . 
  but there are a thousand-and-one ways to kill crowds of people . 
  you will never , ever live in a world in which this can not happen . 
  and to treat this as some grave transgression by hollande is absurd . 
  any national leader could as easily have been in the driver 's seat when this happened .
