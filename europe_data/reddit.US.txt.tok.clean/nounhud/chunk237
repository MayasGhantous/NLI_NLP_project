  so , unjustifiably ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_battles_and_other_violent_events_by_death_toll#terrorist_attacks you know , looking at that list...high-casualty terrorist attacks really are overwhelmingly-dominated by islamic terrorism . 
  you 're blaming * hollande * for nice ? 
  i think that it 's unrealistic to have a perfect rate of catching attacks . 
  [ counterpropaganda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/counterpropaganda ) is n't new , and i imagine that things that have been done in the past still work . 
  probably a lot of material out there about it . 
  nato has n't intervened in ukraine . 
  war is n't cheap for the us either , but i think that the germane bit is that the us has n't fought a war over a significant part of the lower 48 since the 1860s in the american civil war . 
  that was indeed harmful . 
  albania is majority muslim , and it 's in europe . 
  albanians are n't out engaging in terrorism . 
  not unless you extend a pretty long chain of transitive responsibility . 
  whether-or-not it was a good idea to boot out saddam , we gave the people there the opportunity to choose their own leadership . 
  the did so . 
  that leadership asked us to leave . 
  we did . 
  it then fell to a rebellion , and people using that disruption as an opportunity spread across borders . 
  we were asked for aid again , and we 've been aiding the attempt to clean up that rebellion , which has been steadily losing territory . 
  the decision to invade , whether-or-not it was a good idea , was far removed from atrocities backed by that rebellion . 
  you may well disagree with the initial decision to enter . 
  but you ca n't attach everything at all associated with the action to it . 
  isis is responsible for isis 's actions . 
  they had the opportunity to run their own candidates successfully , had the chance not to specifically target civilians , and they fell over on both counts . 
  i do n't accept any responsibility for either country for those acts that they take in trying to create a global caliphate . 
  that 's on their heads . 
  that 's suffering harm , not losing . 
  yes , there 's a conflict , but under the conventional definition of ` losing ' , harm is n't alone enough to qualify . 
  perhaps you 're making some sort of broad philosophical statement that all conflicts are a loss , but if the word is used as is normally the case ... that 's not an indicator of loss . 
  that 's not really what i was getting at -- was raising the point that you seemed to have said that it justified it . 
  i 'm not particularly-enthused about large_scale unskilled immigration , but that 's an economic concern . 
  i doubt that terrorism is a dominant cause of homicide in france . 
  i assume that you 're talking about the civilian mortality increase from the iraq war . 
  iraqis have n't been involved in attacks on the us . 
  you 're saying that stopping immigration would justify terrorism ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_philippines  a unique feature of this flag is its ability to indicate a state of war if it is displayed with the red side on top . 
  by what metric is the west losing ? 
  afaik , the perpetrator has n't yet been identified , so we do n't know whether he was homegrown or not . 
  it 's made of iron beams . 
  i doubt that enough of it is flammable to do any significant harm . 
  international law does n't specify such a process . 
  after russia lost her air defenses , the ground war would no longer be viable . 
  this is n't world war ii . 
  if the need becomes dire enough , there 's always technical and policy solutions . 
  concrete barriers around gathering areas . 
  accepting policies that harm more people via false positives . 
  more-extensive monitoring . 
  we do n't yet know if the perpetrator is a recent migrant . 
  how is le pen going to help anything ? 
  isis is n't getting the modern-day mega-caliphate that they wanted , but that alone does n't eliminate the risk.of attacks . 
  customs are common , though . 
  if people can move goods along the travel pathway , i 'd think that it 's be an eu issue . 
  to be fair , it 's kinda fuzzy on what points eu policy is unified and on which ones it 's not . 
  is ` libya ' speller ` lybia ' in some other common european language ? 
  people here are internationally-aware and near libya , but i 've seen this spelling about half the time , whereas normally spelling errors in country names are rare here . 
  i suspect that this is only the latest move in a process that had been going on for some time . 
  i do n't disagree with the broader point , but you 're assigning merkel too much individual blame . 
  amnesty does n't need to provide a viable alternative or address eu political cohesion , so their bar is rather lower . 
  they 're always going to advocate for giving more -- that 's their job . 
  there is n't a level at which they 're going to be happy . 
  `` relative poverty '' is a measurement of inequality , not wealth . 
  it 's really a regrettable term . 
  these are not comparable numbers . 
  what 's sad about population movement ? 
  that seems like a broader problem to solve . 
  i just linked to a rationalwiki page on globalresearch . 
  it provides extensively-sourced material showing the issues with the site . 
  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/globalresearch without that , custom-crafting a criticism of the site becomes expensive in time . 
  supposing that there was an eu bureau that was in the business of identifying and describing these , instead of fed-up-with-bullshit volunteers having to do it . 
  there are ways to deal with propaganda other than trying to block the voices you disagree with -- which is a risky route to take anyway . 
  hell , we have anti-phishing support in browsers that avoids leaking all the sites you browse but can still identify sketchy websites . 
  same approach can feed off a database listing propaganda . 
  / r/documentaries has a ton of accounts that flood rt video and similar sources . 
  probably because leave promised them that they could ? 
  uh huh , and some other stuff ( the anglo-french aircraft carrier project , etc ) . 
  still , i do n't think that it 's insoluble , and when you weight it against the costs of duplication ... our [ mbt tank gun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m1_abrams ) is german , and that seems to have worked . 
  the f-35 was overbudget ( though that 's not that unusual ) and was a us-uk-italy-australia-canada-norway-denmark-netherlands-turkey project . 
  < headscratch  italy ? 
  germany ? 
  the baltics and ireland appear to also be part of the nordic battlegroup , to be fair . 
  well , it does seem to get into the air ... [ this is about half of the fixed-wing aircraft flying together ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u81n6a7jroc ) . 
   a treaty was signed on 27 may 1952 , but the plan never went into effect ... the plan collapsed when it failed to obtain ratification in the french parliament . 
  there were gaullist fears that the edc threatened france 's national sovereignty , constitutional concerns about the indivisibility of the french republic , and fears about west germany 's remilitarization . 
  french communists opposed a plan tying france to the capitalist usa and setting it in opposition to the communist bloc . 
  other legislators worried about the absence of the united kingdom . 
  the uk military really would be a lot more critical to an eu military than it would the euro or schengen ... and you 'll note that a lot of people here were awfully unhappy about the prospect of the uk getting any opt-outs on things . 
  actually , in wartime , the us federal government is authorized to federalize national guard units from individual states . 
  they can and do serve in the us army ( well , army national guard units do ; air national guard units serve under the us air force , and so forth ) . 
  and the point of constantly having nato units practicing together is to ensure that they * do * have the ability to work together . 
  looking for recent examples , units from the [ tennessee army national guard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qn_c_to_3us&amp;t=40s ) were in estonia recently , and the month before that , units from the [ massachusetts air national guard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvj6p6qlc20 ) . 
  if nato units can interoperate , i 'm pretty sure that eu groupings formed from eu member states can . 
  world war 1 and 2 . 
  the eu did create this since then : [ intcen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_intelligence_and_situation_centre_\\ ( eu_intcen \\ ) ), 
  still does . 
  but , really , this is n't a question of `` should europe duplicate us policy , '' because it wo n't . 
  it 's `` do you want to , in perpetuity , lack the ability to act abroad '' ? 
  maybe not today , or maybe the us or the uk or france or whoever act today . 
  but that seems like a strong commitment . 
  do you feel that * all * actions that the us , uk , and france have taken outside their borders should not have been taken ? 
  vehicles do n't have to be entirely made in one country . 
  instead of multiple apcs , what about splitting up construction between members and making one apc ?
