  right . 
  the link i posted had the lead us trade guy talking about the prospect of the uk being added to the tpp if the eu and the uk ca n't work something out . 
  1970s is getting kinda late for single-income american families . 
  pre-wwii was a more-likely period . 
  the standard of living was a lot lower . 
  wages have not fallen in real terms , but people live , for example , in much bigger houses . 
  i was guessing that competition for different types of jobs would be a greater issue . 
  well , a sustainable world requires replacement level fertility . 
  they wo n't be in as part of the eu , but that does n't mean that they ca n't be party to it . 
  and for tpp , the eu is n't even a member . 
  my point is that the cost here includes a unit cost that includes those fixed costs . 
  it 's like ... let 's say that we build a b-2 spirit and send it to the royal air force . 
  iirc the unit cost on those are about $ 2.1 b. 
  however , that cost is computed by dividing the fixed costs ( r&d ) among the number of units produced and adding it to the marginal cost of producing one more plane . 
  so it really would n't be accurate to say that it cost us $ 2.1 b to give the plane to the raf in that we were already going to pay for the r&d to develop the b-2 anyway . 
  the b-2 marginal cost of production probably is n't cheap , but it 's not $ 2.1 b. 
  same thing for a missile designed to intercept incoming ballistic missiles . 
  the bulk of the resources there are going into r&d . 
  the author theorizes that symptoms in spain in 1981 attributed to adulterated cooking oil were actually due to tomatoes with `` organic-phosphate chemicals '' on them . 
  given that organophosphates are common pesticides , and that in very high concentrations , some can do bad stuff to humans , he presumably thinks that someone dumped the food in a ton of pesticide . 
  he also suggests that [ this ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/eosinophilia%e2%80%93myalgia_syndrome ) outbreak in the us , attributed to a contaminated dietary supplement from japan , was due to the same thing , confusing the supplement itself with the contaminant . 
  he claims that there was a government cover-up in both cases . 
  in sum , it 's an article from the anti-pesticide crowd . 
  could have been related to this : http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-trade-iduskcn0zm2je, 
  putin , you causing trouble in europe again ? 
  ditto for getting it up to replacement rate . 
  while i agree with his overall points , who is it in the world who does n't do the same thing ? 
  to be fair , while i generally think that the reforms in the us were a good idea and are more intuitive , the brit `` aluminium '' is more consistent with the names of other substances . 
  iirc , california was talking about making them non-street-legal . 
  have n't been following that , but afaik the same did n't apply to other states . 
  why would they be worthless elsewhere ? 
  two reasons . 
  first , my understanding from listening to an international business law lecture series is that it is far more common in tort law in europe than the us to require improperly-done work to be done properly by the offender . 
  the us tends to have cash payouts for damages -- could be that the harm will be remedied by someone else or by the offender . 
  second , my understanding is that a full remedy ca n't be provided via work -- that is , a software fix can make emissions conformant , but will sacrifice points on which buyers purchased the car , including mileage and power . 
  were models from all these brands affected ? 
  first , because my goal is to highlight the problems of using a lone data point . 
  the number is only interesting compared to what * would * have happened . 
  without any control data , the only thing to compare against is our expectations , and those may be wildly disconnected from reality . 
  second , my assumption is that that data is in a german-language publication ; in the past , when i went looking for swedish rape data , i had to slog through a lot of swedish material explaining the situation . 
  i do n't speak german . 
  after he became a critic . 
  well , that 's kind of a lone data point . 
  how many german women were sexually-assaulted on new year 's eve in , say , 2008 ? 
  is it reasonably safe to say that * the independent * was n't going to approve of a tory prime minister , regardless of who got the position ? 
  i mean , i 'd imagine that it 's more-used in spain and thereabouts . 
  globally , [ something over twice as many people speak spanish as speak russian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers ) , but you may well be less-likely to run into the spanish speakers , which tend to be in the americas . 
  well , he 's the leader of the executive . 
  if it 's anything like it is over here , that 's a recipe for increasing unpopularity . 
  since presidential approval polling started , only [ fdr , ford , reagan , and clinton ] ( http://us-presidents.insidegov.com/stories/2973/ranked-presidential-approval-ratings-first-worst ) left office more-popular than they entered . 
  the [ plurality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plurality_\\ ( voting \\ ) ) ( `` relative majority '' in british english ) probably wanted remain , but all of the leave options got merged into one . 
  magistrate ? 
  premier ? 
   and looks to gain access to the single market , with immigration controls what does `` access '' mean here ? 
  was this precisely the same thing that the eu said was n't going to happen ? 
  the term '' [ trickle down economics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trickle-down_economics ) '' was a term used by activists opposed to him , just to be clear . 
  i mean that ireland relies on the uk being nearby . 
   justice is not about sending a signal to other criminals , but about trying and judging a suspect fairly . 
  one might say that our social norms ( including our concept of `` fairness '' ) are themselves derived from `` what makes society work '' , which includes sending a signal to other criminals -- deterrence . 
  for example , often `` fairness '' involves equality , right ? 
  yet we do n't generally adopt the principle of literal [ * lex talonis * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eye_for_an_eye ) in our legal system today , and i 'm pretty sure that many people would think of doing so as horribly uncivilized . 
  and yet , there was a point in time when that would have been considered eminently fair . 
  social norms have adopted values that support practical systems that we consider effective . 
  would n't it be possible to make a bailout contingent upon splitting retail and investment banking without nationalization ? 
  i mean , let 's assume that you want to separate the two . 
  presumably , you 're going to want the same safeguards on all banks , which means that it 's going to become regulation anyway , right ? 
  i mean , think of two possible serious risks : * item 1 : if nationalization becomes predictable , it becomes a glorious way to unload losses . 
  [ moral hazard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral_hazard ) . 
  * item 2 : if you force nationalization , even if you 're paying current market value for it , you 're basically forcing a hostile takeover of private property at a time when it 's at a particularly low value . 
  that creates its own [ perverse incentives ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perverse_incentive ) -- how likely am i going to want to be to invest in a company in a country if the moment it gets in a tough spot and its value drops , someone else forces me to sell out at that price ? 
  and for that, 
  well , if that 's the concern , and some country is hypothetically too small to produce something in turn that would be wanted by another country ( which seems odd , but okay , let 's go with it ) , collaborate with someone else on whatever it is and allocate production so that it 's vaguely spending-neutral . 
  it 's not as if estonia is the only country to see fights over where spending goes . 
  [ here 's the f-35 supply chain ] ( http://media.defenceindustrydaily.com/images/pub_f-35_industrial_map_2008_lg.jpg ) . 
   and it gives the government direct control of how the bank is run without having to pass regulations first . 
  what would be the benefit here ? 
  that is , what actions would you want the bank to take that it could n't be done with it as a private entity ? 
  in particular , if you 're doing a bailout , you can presumably do it on whatever terms you want . 
  why specifically * nationalize * , though ? 
   the banks are giving risky loans because they think that state will always come to the rescue when shit hits the fan . 
  while i agree that moral hazard is a risk , i 'd be uncomfortable overruling existing bank regulators on how important that risk is relative to other risks . 
   when it goes the euro will go with it . 
  hmm . 
  why ? 
  i mean , okay , i can understand that any hypothetical loss-of-confidence in the banking system would produce economic issues . 
  but why would it require a currency change ? 
  [ doom at deutsche bank ] ( http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/249246/doom-at-deutsche-bank ) beats it on article title pessimism . 
  ireland does the same thing with the uk . 
   they do n't realise just how much cheaper everything from eating out to grocery bills are thanks , and it [ is cheaper than switzerland ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=switzerland&amp;country2=united+states ) , but to be fair ... switzerland has the [ highest cost of living in the oecd ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=cpl ) ( and thus probably in the world ) : any country will manage that . 
  you did point out the combination of high wages and a low cost of living , and that 's certainly significant ; just pointing out that by , say , hungarian standards , the us would have a high cost of living . 
   well how about we help ukraine become stable enough to join nato and the eu ? 
  well , stability to enter the eu may very well be a good idea . 
  however , it 's worth pointing out that ukraine joining with the crimea conflict underway would mean nato-russia conflict . 
  that would probably not sell well with most nato members . 
  http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1099020.html  laity also said that settling territorial disputes with neighbors remains one of the fundamental criteria for nato membership : `` it is very clear that we do not want to import people 's disputes , and we have put a high priority -- and we did with the czech republic , hungary , and poland -- on settling outstanding issues with their neighbors . 
  and it is very , very important that countries recognize that this is something we look at very carefully , and we do expect them to sort out disputes with neighbors . '', 
    but analyst gedmin pointed out that nato in the past did give priority to geostrategic considerations and did admit countries with both border problems and insufficiently consolidated democracies , such as turkey . 
    `` it 's clear that nato -- as a body , as an institution , as an organization -- has given different emphasis to different criteria at different times during its history , '' gedmin said . 
  `` remember , for example , that turkey was admitted decades ago , even though it was lacking in some of the areas that we are talking about in terms of political development and democratic stability . '', 
  may your heart 's every desire be granted .
