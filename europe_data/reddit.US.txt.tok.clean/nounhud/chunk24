  maybe farm workers need retraining or guest workers need to head home or something , but it feels kinda like the french government might be just ignoring the politically-difficult fact that there are going to be a lot of people out of work in the near future . 
   in usa it was the republicans that were left and democrats that were right . 
  eh ... the republican party was into social value reform , but right economically during that era . 
   there is no eu border security force .

  a search of [ reedit submissions from geenstijl ] ( https://www.reddit.com/domain/geenstijl.nl/ ) shows the shift to political content to date to approximately two years ago . 
   one : aviation . 
  currently , uk airlines are free to operate routes both between and within other eu member states . 
  but under their deal , canadian airlines are only allowed to operate routes in europe if they start or end at a canadian airport . 
  eeew .

  we 're as bad as the eu . 
  props for digging up the criteria . 
   last month , a four-year-old was sentenced to life in prison for four murders , attempting another eight , vandalising property and threatening police officers ... `` none of you understand .

   russia is n't a shit country to live in , i 'm assuming they do it to eliminate or soften potential leverage . 
  storing assets in the eu or us only works if you are n't going to antagonize them to the point of targeted asset freezes ( i.e. 
  effective confiscation ) . 
   once the oil dries up , it 's chaos for that region as their mighty leaders jet off to london to sit on their billions .

  [ viking-age laws and legal procedures ] ( http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/laws.htm )  the icelandic settlers were opposed to a central state dependent on the authority of a lord or king . 
  writing in the 11th century , adam of bremen said of the icelanders , `` they have no king except the law . '', 
  well , * that * seems to be working out awfully well today , if nothing else . 
   the author of laxd\u00e6la saga says that men whose testimony was doubted could clear themselves by suffering an ordeal , described in chapter 18 . 
  the author adds that heathen men undergoing an ordeal were just as conscious of their responsibility as christian men . 
  the ordeal involved raising an arch of turf cut from the earth . 
  a man who passed under the arch without it collapsing was thought to be free of guilt . 
  this sounds suspiciously like a cabal of icelandic structural engineers set these rules up . 
   in addition , external force could be brought to bear to influence the court 's decision . 
  the sagas tell of bribes , of threats of violence , and of actual violence in court . 
  sounds like a much-more-exciting form of * law and order * . 
   lastly , the parties might resort to bloodshed , either in formal duels , or in blood feuds ( discussed in more detail in the article about honor ) . 
  `` you must prove your honor , gunnlaugsson ! '', 
   once the court had decided that someone was guilty of breaking the law , the al\u00feing had no power to execute a sentence . 
  that was up to the injured party , or his or her family or supporters . 
  that should be interesting , since currently the pirate party is the dominant party in iceland : the pirates would , i guess , be the injured party , so i guess a mob of pirates carry out the sentence . 
   but the most common sentence was outlawry . 
  the guilty party was placed outside the bounds of society . 
  someone subject to full outlawry ( sk\u00f3ggangur ) was banished from society . 
  his property was confiscated . 
  he could not be fed or sheltered . 
  wherever he went , he could be killed without penalty by anyone who saw him . 
  lesser outlawry ( fj\u00f6rbaugsgar\u00f0ur ) differed in that the guilty party was banished for only three years . 
  his property was not confiscated , making it possible for him to return to a normal life after the three years was over . 
  `` and no cell service , either ! '', 
   and then on wednesday he disappeared . 
  aid workers have been told he was seen climbing on to a ferry bound for kent . 
  no missing persons report has been filed by the french authorities , so british charities contacted the children 's commissioner to get the kent police and social services to help ... yesterday kareem was found in kent . 
  sounds like he did n't exactly go missing -- he just illegally-immigrated to the uk . 
  the article seems to be calling on the uk to take in a number of refugees , which would be pretty much identical to what is happening here other than that the uk would also then be accepting official responsibility for them . 
   in the us if a state is close to insolvency does n't the federal government step in and force the creditors to take a cut in their debt ? 
  [ no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_bankruptcies_in_the_1840s ) , when you guys lent some us states money and they defaulted in the 1840s , the federal government just said `` well , sucks to be the bank of england '' . 
   the imf 's managing director christine lagarde has denied that they are trying to pressurise anyone . 
  100 psi and rising !, 
   this could also have been stockholm - \u00c5bo ( finland ) , i honestly ca n't remember as i was mostly just passed out when the ferry arrived , so i did n't have a chance to find out where i was before the ferry started going back to sweden i was already laughing when i * started * reading this bit . 
  this is not what i expected when i imagined a ferry . 
   there is no way this is true . 
  i 've taken one class from a retired-police-officer-turned-ethics-professor who covered the issue and i 've seen multiple us police sources arguing on the point , and all were unanimous in agreement with you -- you simply can not control a bullet sufficiently-well to make it reliably non-lethal , and shooting someone in the legs can easily sever an artery . 
  if you 're going to be firing a gun at someone , you should n't be doing so unless you cross the threshold for it being acceptable to kill someone , and if you actually meet that threshold , you should n't be dicking around with trying to shoot them in the foot or something ( a difficult shot to make reliably ) . 
  this can sometimes be confused because if it 's given explicitly , police policy is `` shoot to incapacitate '' , but that does n't mean shooting someone in the leg or foot is reasonable -- it just means that if someone * is * incapacitated , an officer should n't be shooting them in the head . 
  it does n't mean that an officer is going to be shooting anywhere other than the chest . 
  no , but i thought that your post was a response to the glock post , which it was not . 
  i knew about nestle , but i definitely thought that nokia was japanese at one point . 
  that 's probably because there is pretty much no other european electronics manufacturer whose name i 'd recognize in the us . 
  if it is n't american , it 's probably from east asia . 
  i 'm sure that it sounds odd to be an recognizable product , but i was moving to wet shaving a while back , and turkey 's arko was one of the most-universally-liked common shaving soaps out there ( along with the italian cella ) , and i kind of [ have turkey mentally-associated with elaborate shaving anyway ] ( http://istanbul.for91days.com/2013/06/08/the-formidable-facial-hair-of-the-turks/ ) . 
  by-and-large , the eu seems to export relatively-little over here that 's recognizable to me as a consumer ( lack of trade agreements like ttip ? 
  economies too similar to make export useful ? ), 
  iirc from trade charts , the us tends to export to europe , europe to asia , and asia to the us . 
  the ones that have products that i 'd recognize as associated with a country : * netherlands : klm . 
  on the downside , i know them as dutch because of their involvement in the [ greatest air disaster in history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tenerife_airport_disaster ) , so i 'm not sure that 's a positive . 
  * uk : i guess this is n't really a brand per se , but you guys have those protected geographic designation things , and i really like various british sweet cheeses with fruits . 
  dunno if it counts as a brand . 
  i do n't drink it , though , and the irish brand that i would most use would probably be [ cahill 's farm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cahill's_farm_cheese ) . 
  * germany : bmw or volkswagen , auto manufacturing . 
  * austria : as some other people have mentioned , glock . 
  this * ate * the practical-use us handgun market . 
  yeah , sorry ` bout that , finland . 
  * sweden : ikea * estonia : skype * italy : armani * switzerland : victorinox ( swiss army knives ) edit : oh , yeah , someone mentioned poland 's * the witcher * product line ... [ gog ] ( https://www.gog.com/ ) is something that i purchase products from on a regular basis . 
  probably not what someone thinks of as iconic in that it 's still pretty young , though . 
  edit2 : and speaking of video games , [ * metro : last light * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metro:_last_light ) is the * only * ukranian product that i know that i own .

  i tried riga gold sprats after russia blocked import and discovered that i liked them a lot -- and now they 're my favorite type of canned fish -- but i 've never heard of the other three companies before now . 
  i 've often wondered about that . 
  european handgun brands like the austrian glock and italian beretta have made significant inroads . 
  i do n't know how popular czech [ czub ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%8cesk%c3%a1_zbrojovka_uhersk%c3%bd_brod ) is in the us , but i 'd certainly heard of the [ cz-75 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cz_75 ) . 
  the swiss [ sig ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schweizerische_industrie_gesellschaft ) is a name . 
  us handgun manufacturers that i 'd recognize the name of : * [ colt ( apparently went bankrupt last year ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colt's_manufacturing_company ) * [ smith & wesson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smith_%26_wesson ) * [ springfield armory , inc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/springfield_armory,_inc . ), 
  * [ sturm , ruger & co ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sturm,_ruger_%26_co . ), 
  * [ savage arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savage_arms ) * [ kel-tec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kel-tec ) i 'm sure that i could recognize a few more , but `` glock '' is a name i mentally associate with innovation and a functional product . 
  some of the above us companies seem to me to be trading off past reputation -- if you 're selling m1911 pistols , you 're relying on nostalgia to sell product , not producing something technically-superior .
