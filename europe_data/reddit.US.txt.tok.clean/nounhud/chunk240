  or that the sentence is to fire the perpetrator out of a cannon . 
  russia has taken and is occupying parts of two of its neighbors in the last few years . 
  nobody has taken russian soil . 
  trump 's not a hawk . 
  or , if he is , it would be in conflict with his campaign material to date . 
  eh , he 's on the campaign trail and iirc it was an offhand comment . 
  it 's not on his list of campaign issues , and nato has , last poll i looked at , 77 % approval in the us . 
   if the middel east would be more stabel and the economy wasnt ruined there by us intervenion they would flee into the middel east and ot europe . 
  the middle east lacks economic opportunity compared to europe . 
  you might manage to buy off the regimes of the governments there to stop people , but that 's about as far as you 'd get . 
   i do n't see eeurope ever placing their defense in the hands of an european army . 
  `` ever '' is a long time . 
  most us states did n't feel a whole lot of sympathy to each other early on , either . 
  well , that really refers to the government or something along those lines , and i suppose really only the set of policy-making stuff in the government . 
  i mean , i 'm not really enthusiastic about north korea , but i really do n't have any negative feelings towards factory worker # 2,985,123 . 
  i could really do with the kim regime not threatening to nuke/shell his neighbors on a regular basis , and periodically engaging in small-scale attacks , though . 
   europe still has love for america < blushes , 
  i was puzzled by the thumbnail : it 's from [ north korea threatens ` physical response ' against u.s. thaad system deployment ] ( http://mobile.reuters.com/article/newsmaps/iduskcn0zq107 ) . 
   where does estonias spending go ? 
  directly into the us economy ... we can probably assume that wage/pension/other compensation does n't do that ; i assume that you 're referring to equipment procurement costs . 
  i do n't have a dollar value breakdown handy , but i do have a list of active equipment on wikipedia : * [ estonian air force ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_air_force ) looking at the list , there are 8 aircraft . 
  [ four of those ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robinson_r44 ) are light utility helicopters made by robinson , which is indeed us-originating . 
  two are attack aircraft from czechia . 
  there are two biplane transport aircraft left over from the soviet union . 
  there are two british-originating transport aircraft that were purchased by the us military . 
  i do know the history on those , since they were a recent donation : as the us military transitioned to a less-diverse set of transports , it donated them to estonia . 
  i do n't know what the story of those helicopters is , but i suppose that the us could very well have pulled in tax revenue on them . 
  there are also some air-defense radar systems listed -- five sweden-originating mobile passive radars , one us-originating mobile passive radar , two french-originating mobile active radars , and some unknown number of other tracking systems from czechia . 
  i suppose that the us could very well have pulled in tax revenue on the passive radar set . 
  * [ estonian navy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_estonian_navy_ships ) there are no us-originating ships here -- all are from the uk , finland , or denmark . 
  * [ estonian ground forces ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_equipment_of_the_maav%c3%a4gi ) the us-originating gear includes : a bunch of m-14s used as ceremonial rifles . 
  some m2 heavy machine guns . 
  javelin anti-tank infantry weapon . 
  30 anti-tank recoilless rifles . 
  80 medium mortars . 
  some mil-spec pickup trucks . 
  the overwhelming bulk of the entries here ( though , admittedly , i do n't know the dollar value ) are not from the us ; germany , and to a lesser extent , sweden dominate . 
  nato does not mandate purchasing from any country , does not require spending on requisitions , and any country is welcome to spend it on domestically-produced arms or even purchase arms from non-nato countries ( e.g. 
  turkey was off purchasing some sort of chinese anti-air system a while back , as i recall ) . 
  it may not affect savings linked to the euro , but it does affect wages , unemployment , and government services . 
  i 'd be kinda curious to see what the practical impact is on the day-to-day life of people in recessions in different net worth brackets . 
  i 'd be suspicious that this is just being better at choreographing something for the public 's benefit . 
  the bureaucracy is n't doing its work on c-span . 
  i disagree . 
  if there are issues , they 're institutional ones . 
  as such , penalizing * individuals * rather than the organization just means that you create an opportunity for scapegoating in the future . 
  huh . 
  i 'd think that a bank going under taking someone 's savings with it would be mostly a microeconomic issue . 
   i think us made a profit bailing their banks out if you ignore the opportunity cost , yes . 
  could have been other things done with those assets . 
   i would push for immediate nationalisation i do n't get it . 
  does n't that immediately shift liability for the losses to you ? 
   in case of greece being dead all people in europe will pay hmm . 
  only the 17 eurozone members , right ? 
  it looks like the [ efsf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_financial_stability_facility ) is a eurozone rather than an eu-as-a-whole project . 
   that 's not even that much . 
  i know nothing about the specific numbers involved , but i would note that often the cost of government projects are estimated well below their final costs by advocates . 
  to the degree that this would be intentional , i 'd say that it avoids sticker shock , and helps get the relevant parties into having committed to the solution . 
   plus we 've got the vast majority of it back now okay , but is a bailout of british banking then a good predictor of the losses involved in an italian bailout now ? 
  how much of that $ 166b is going to be just eating losses ? 
  while i agree , people on both sides also made extremely-optimistic-compared-to-reality predictions about schedules in both world war i and ii . 
  i suspect that there is a tendency to over-estimate the speed of resolution . 
  militaries will already do that planning ( particularly since roles may change over time as needs change ) . 
  this is just to push governments to give those militaries sufficient resources to be able to do their job . 
  i 'm sure that any british contributions to europe will come up , and i further imagine that the prospect of the uk pulling out will remain private to avoid spooking publics . 
   there 's an agreement when a member state signs up for nato that they 're supposed to spend a certain amount . 
  it 's not a mandate . 
  the people creating nato had that option and chose not to make it a mandate . 
  there are real problems with requiring countries to put money into a pool -- [ it becomes open to abuse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delian_league ) , and is n't what you 'd want ( and why i think that trump 's offhand comments are a bad idea ) . 
  on the other hand , if you make it voluntary , you run into the [ public good ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_good ) problem that we 're seeing now -- every member would like to cut * its * military spending , since it can benefit from the spending of the other members and can * also * enjoy the increased money that it 's saving . 
  national defense is one of the classic examples of a public good . 
  that winds up with a couple of countries on russia 's border spending at 2 % and the people behind them spending below , which does n't really seem optimal either . 
   the only countries that matter are the usa , uk , france , germany and maybe italy , but that 's stretching it . 
  there 's a certain tragedy-of-the-commons to that ( which , granted , is going to be somewhat of a reality for a military alliance with voluntary military spending levels , but ... ), 
  i wonder how a dollar value is computed here for compulsory military service . 
  ordinarily , you could just look at the wages spent to determine how much a country is spending on military service . 
  however , some countries , like estonia , compel military service . 
  sure , they pay , but it 's going to be below-market-rate ( else they would n't * need * to be requiring that service -- people would come on their own ) . 
  that means that they 're effectively paying more than the actual budget item -- it would need to take into account opportunity cost of whatever else joe estonian conscript would be otherwise doing . 
  if so , these numbers would under-value the spending that those countries are doing . 
  no , it just means that saying that the conservative party passed it is n't incompatible with the use of gay rights ( or anything else , for that matter ) as a political identifier . 
   forcing them all to move elsewhere for work is what is destroying communities . 
  ca n't forge new communities without people moving !, 
  [ people fought quite a costly battle to be able to move elsewhere for work in england ] ( http://www.britannia.com/history/articles/peasantsrevolt.html ) . 
   however , the main call of the peasant rebels was for the abolition of serfdom . 
  this was because , since the middle of the century , their lords had prevented them from making the most of the changing economic conditions . 
  visitations of the plague since 1348/9 had reduced the population by between a third and a half . 
  as a result , labour became more scarce , wages rose and the economy began to suit the peasant more than it suited the landowner . 
  however , the landowners of parliament legislated to keep wages low and to restrict the free movement of serfs . 
  locally , landowners in their capacity as manorial lords also tried to tighten the feudal dues that serfs were obliged to carry out for them . 
  needless to say , the peasantry resented both these measures and there were local revolts both in the decade before and after 1381 . 
    he 's saying that if you 're in an area where you ca n't get work and are unwilling or unable to move to an area where you can , you 're out of luck . 
    that 's not my vision for europe ; i do n't want to live in a place where the cold logic of capitalism replaces community . 
  so you 're saying that if your country 's economy needs workers in one area and not in another , you do n't want people in your country to move to where demand is ? 
  the political identification does n't need to be between parties in a country . 
  works internationally , too . 
  frankly , the reason gay rights has the degree of prominence it does here is [ because it acts as a political identifier ] ( http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/ ) . 
  it 's like western clothing in japan was for westernizers or the [ mao suit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mao_suit ) for asian marxism or the [ fez ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fez ) was by turkish secularists -- a way to signal which `` side '' you 're on . 
  it 's not because any of the above were deeply-immersed in the issues of clothing cut per se .
