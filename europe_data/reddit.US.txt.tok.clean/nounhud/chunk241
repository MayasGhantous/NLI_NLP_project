   then , afd reported to have collected 3.1 million $ in donations which is an absurdly huge amount - the big parties only get around 400k a year in donations ( 2015 : cdu 600k , fdp 550k , spd 220k ) while getting ~ 30-40 % of voters , while a 10 % party gets ten times that amount in donations ? 
  afd claimed that several patriotic millionaires were to thank for this , but i am scepetical . 
  unless those patriotic millionaires bankrupted themselves in one year of donations , it 's more than several patriotic millionaires . 
  also , * damn * , you guys have comparatively-low donations . 
  each of our two major parties [ gets upwards of $ 500m every two-year election cycle ] ( https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/donordemographics.php?cycle=2014&amp;filter=a ) . 
  how do germany 's parties market themselves and pay people to analyze voter data and whatnot on that kind of budget ? 
   in 2015 , spd spent 186 million , cdu 151 million euro . 
  ah ... goverment funding ? 
  `` we want a class system , and we want it now ! '', 
   but these wo n't counter ballistic missiles that would hit the us mainland . 
  the r&d will be a move towards countering ballistic missiles anywhere . 
  the price will primarily be due to fixed costs of r&d . it 's in the us 's interest to have a counter to ballistic missiles , and this contributes towards that . 
  are there non-artificial nations ? 
  if it achieves its purpose , does n't much matter who is operating it . 
  greece does have a veto . 
  they did . 
  outside of nato 's scope . 
  domestic political issues should imho be avoided . 
  `` fast track '' refers to a specific process that is n't involved here . 
  also , the tpp thing is not yet an offer . 
  it 's an idea being raised by the us trade negotiators . 
  it would need other signoffs before it 's something concrete . 
  let 's hypothetically say that your approach is adopted . 
  they would have done well on their own , but hardline policy instead turns it into a fiasco -- that 's the case where taking such a position would be successful . 
  do you think that other eu members would find this convincing as an argument that the eu is the best option for them , to believe that it was a matter of the uk not being able to make it on its own , a true demonstration that the eu is providing a net benefit ? 
  or see that it was pressure from brussels and at best be cowed into remaining ? 
  the whole ` cow into remaining ' thing did n't work well for the ussr . 
  article 50 was not an accident . 
  it was put in place because those who built the eu wanted -- at least at this stage of development -- members to have the option of exiting . 
  that may not remain in place forever -- my guess is that if the eu federalizes , it will be gone or go then . 
  but at the moment , it 's there , and an attempt to frighten members from exercising it without having removed the option seems like going back on such a guarantee -- and it 's not a small guarantee . 
   leave http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskcn0zm2je one possibility would be the uk joining tpp . 
   income gap has blown up agreed . 
  though that is via more-rapid growth on the part of highly-skilled workers . 
   it 's harder to buy and pay for a house now , that really would best be addressed by allowing for more construction . 
  i mean , i agree that there are markets where prices have risen , but at the end of the day , if more construction does n't happen , people are just fighting over who gets excluded from an insufficient supply of housing . 
  the exclusion line gets drawn where someone is no longer willing to pat for housing . 
  as long as the cost of housing is above the cost of construction of more housing , all that has to happen is to let developers build -- pull zoning restrictions on height and whatnot . 
   it 's almost impossible to support a family on a single full-time income now yeah , but that 's also a factor of the standard of living increasing combined with it being the norm for women to work outside the home . 
  i mean , in 1920 women did n't work ... but if you want to live by a 1920s standard of living , they would n't need to today either . 
  would be a pretty substantial drop , though . 
   , and people see more and more wealth around them - but they do n't have it . 
  fair enough . 
   so yeah , they 're blaming foreigners , but they 're also wanting to shut the borders , tear down trade agreements . 
  the resistance to ttip and ttp , the growing sense of nationalism , of `` taking care of our own '' . 
  it 's also a big fuck-you to the billionaires who got rich from globalization . 
  certainly the poorer parts of england see it as a big fuck-you to london . 
  well , it 'd be possible to take that money away from well-to-do people in london ... but that 's a one-off , because london is n't going to have those people long if it 's not a competitive with other places to live . 
  you can educate each new generation in skills that are in-demand , and that * is * done -- but that 's their children , not them . 
  the cold equations of economics also mean that it provides a smaller return to retrain an adult than to train a child -- fewer years of skilled work in return . 
  the uk does have progressive taxation , and tends to transfer i guess in terms of utility , the question becomes one of how many people you lose by taxing the well-to-do more . 
   1 ) literally every country at the table claiming it would steal londons business ( as if that 'd not have happened already if they were actually capable of that ) . 
  well , that 's an argument that the companies could not do so alone , but eu members were also limited in barriers to trade that they could erect . 
  slovakia , your hat is getting worked up again . 
  note that being a diplomat is not incompatible with also spying . 
  if the guy is a spy and a diplomat , he 'd get shipped back to the us if arrested due to diplomatic immunity , but in that case he may have had documents or something else that he did n't want seized . 
  no , embassy soil is not foreign . 
  however , very long and widely-accepted convention means that there are a lot of rights granted people on embassy ground . 
  there is , i think , no people in europe who have not both wronged and been wronged . 
  start settling old scores between ancestors and all europe would be a miserable wreck . 
  you do n't think that eu companies will start complaining about smuggled goods ? 
  cool !, 
  was n't aware of these . 
  i still want to see poll data or something else aggregate about concerns . 
  interviewing a handful of people and making an edited story out of it may not give a very representative image . 
  well , the economic instability bit seems more-than reasonable . 
  that does n't make sense . 
  fptp favors regional concerns , and if a region is unhappy with london ... 
   builders just building locally in a village for example only see a polish team taking their work doing it for cheaper . 
  sure . 
  i 'm not disputing that that 's their motivation -- i 'm saying that i do n't think that the factor is `` access to the benefits of prosperity '' , but rather `` not wanting increased future competition relative to the status quo '' . 
  [ the first amendment probably conflicts with attempts at such laws ] ( http://www.rcfp.org/first-amendment-handbook/statutory-restraints-prior-restraints-and-internet ) . 
  typically publications do not release the name of juvenile suspects or of sexual assault victims , and many newspapers that i 've read just do n't list names in their police blotter section ( though full stories about crimes do normally contain names ) . 
  but honestly ... the idea that * victims * would need to be protected is a new one on me . 
  i could see people arguing that the names of * suspects * should n't be published , like , to help avoid biasing juries or something like that . 
  but * victims * are normally people who have been wronged , and if anything the public is typically sympathetic . 
  those people seem to know where they live already . 
  they 're not in some sort of witness protection program , ffs . 
  < rolls eyes  and the fact that you 're fine with blocking journalists from doing it violates * my * social norms . 
   we 'd love to have more poles move here yes . 
  * now * we do . 
  but that 's not because of some sort of superior national character . 
  that 's because the us is used to them and they 're part of the group . 
  just like when we were in the position of the brits , back when a lot of poles were coming over * en masse * and existing workers started getting worried about jobs and wages , there was plenty of upset and resentment -- exact same thing that the brits are seeing now . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_poles_in_the_united_states  the immigrants of the late 19th-early 20th century wave were very different from those who arrived in the united states earlier . 
  by and large , those who arrived in the early 19th century were nobility and political exiles ; those in the wave of immigration were largely poor , uneducated , and willing to settle for manual labor positions . 
  pseudoscientific studies were conducted on polish immigrants in the early 20th century , most notably by carl brigham . 
  in a study of human intelligence , which relied heavily on english aptitude tests from the u.s. military , brigham concluded that poles have inferior intelligence and their population would dilute the superior `` nordic '' american stock . 
  his data was highly damning towards blacks , italians , jews , and other slavs . 
  [ 97 ] [ 98 ] [ 99 ] a united states congress joint immigration commission study prepared on polish americans cited similar studies and said poles were undesirable immigrants because of their `` inherently unstable personalities '' . 
  in a historical text examining poland , nevin winter described in 1913 that `` an extremeness in temperament is a characteristic of the slav '' and asserting this view as an inborn and unchangeable personality trait in poles as well as russians . 
  [ 101 ] [ discuss ] future u.s. president woodrow wilson called poles , hungarians , and italians , in his 1902 history of the american people , `` men of the meaner sort '' who possessed `` neither skill nor energy nor any initiative of quick intelligence . '', 
  he later called these groups less preferable than the chinese immigrants . 
  [ 102 ] [ snip ]  polish immigration was increasing rapidly in the early 20th century until 1911 when it was drastically cut by new legislation . 
  immigration from europe was cut severely in 1911 , and the quota for polish immigrants was shrunk drastically . 
  poles were restricted from coming to the united states for decades , and only after world war ii were the immigration laws reversed . 
     the poles were the last to come in large numbers before world war i and the quota act which choked off immigration . 
  consequently they were subjected to far more than their share of prejudice and discrimination bred usually not by malice , but by fear -- chiefly economic insecurity of the minorities already settled in the areas to which they came .
