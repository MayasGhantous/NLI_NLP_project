  since other groups did not succeed them in large numbers , they remained for longer than the usual period at the lowest level occupationally and residentially , since others did not `` push them up . '', 
    -- theresita polzin , the polish americans . 
  [ 118 ] follows a pretty much identical pattern to every group of immigrants to come over to the us in large waves all at once -- deep resentment and unhappiness on the part of the incumbents , followed by people not caring some number of decades later . 
  same thing with the italians , the irish , [ the chinese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seattle_riot_of_1886 ) , you name it . 
  and we had tempers get a lot hotter , including lynchings -- immigration is one of the things that people get just about the most worked-up over . 
  in the us , immigration got choked down to ethnicity-mirroring-existing-ethnicities based migration between 1870 and 1920 , and then moved to a very limited flow of skill-based migration after world war ii . 
  no , i think that the difference is that ( a ) you hear about issues more easily today due to mass media and ( b ) we never incorporated pre-existing states of large populations and had the ability to impose immigration brakes , whereas the eu is trying to incorporate many populous countries all at once and part of the core ideology is free flow of population -- not something that the eu wants to retreat from . 
  as i was telling / u/aboutdesouffle a [ few hours ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4rnwrh/why_europes_largest_economy_is_resisting_the_new/d53ugxc ) , i do n't much trust claims about national character without data ... 
   areas that do n't get the benefits of prosperity . 
  people in europe today probably have the greatest access to the benefits of prosperity that has ever existed on the continent . 
  that does n't mean that it 's just `` i want to keep digging a ditch and get paid vastly more for it '' , but in terms of opportunity , it seems pretty difficult to complain about . 
  and one might add ... how many people in poland are off torching the houses of brit expats ? 
  i think that it 's reasonable to say that the major factor is that people just do n't like the prospect of increased future competition relative to the status quo , not not getting the benefits of prosperity . 
  first , i do n't see why it would be objectionable -- it 's not as if there 's something that they 'd want to hide . 
  second , they 're clearly cooperating with the media to get the article out , including giving quotes and photographs . 
  i 'm not following ... you mean that you believe that the uk would n't be let into those areas , or would n't be let in on favorable terms ? 
  if so , you 're not saying that that would be an issue with simply not activating article 50 , right ? 
  you 're saying that it would be a problem if they * did * activate article 50 , leave , and then might not be let in ? 
   resistance to change is baked into many germans ' dna . 
  a country that has experienced no shortage of turmoil over the past century , germans crave nothing more than stability . 
  i 've never liked broad statements like this about national character without actual data . 
  too often narratives like this seem to be pulled out of the air . 
  i assumed that this is the norm around the world . 
  man , this is on-topic , but my [ earlier submission of this ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-trade-iduskcn0zm2je ) is n't ? 
  that 's only if you split up all the uk 's ethnicities , though . 
  which may make more sense if scotland goes , granted ... 
  probably because a large number of people are coming to the uk in a short period of time and people see that as job competition for unskilled major . 
  other members in the eu have their own difficulties to deal with , of course , and many countries would like to have people trying to get in , but that one is a uk issue . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shaftment used to be a bit larger than that , more like 6 and 1/2 inches . 
  do n't forget the ever-essential hand-shackle . 
  * clearly * should have never gone in the first place !, 
  after all , as benjamin franklin put it , `` an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure '' !, 
  nonsense !, 
  we 'll never adopt the [ stone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stone_\\ ( unit \\ ) ) !, 
  actually , the brits have a different pint from us . 
   us vs the rest . 
  also , note that the tpp may ( we 'll see -- as the article i linked to references , that 's up in the air ) wind up including china . 
  china 's economy is presently nearly as large as the us 's ( [ us is $ 18.6 t ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states ) , and [ china $ 11.4 t ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/china ) ) . 
  if so , the us would not be the majority of the tpp . 
  if china continues to economically develop , some years down the road , the us may not even be the largest single member of the tpp . 
   anglosphere union just to be clear , tpp is only a free trade agreement -- goods and services movement . 
  it is not an anglosphere union on par with the european union -- tpp does not specify political unification , free movement , free labor , etc. 
  it would be compatible with other integration , but does not itself entail something like that . 
  there is some [ interest between the uk-ca-au-nz publics in having freedom of movement and labor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_freedom_of_movement_organisation ) , and that would be closer to an anglosphere union , but that is not the tpp , and neither it nor the tpp would entail an au other than in being compatible with it . 
  it may be more popular with the public of those countries :  in november 2015 , a national poll conducted across the uk by market research firm yougov found that a free movement initiative between the uk , canada , australia and new zealand would be significantly more popular than the current arrangement with the european union . 
  of those surveyed , 58 % favoured the free movement proposals , with only 19 % opposing and 23 % uncertain . 
  this was in comparison to 46 % favouring the current arrangement with the european union , 35 % opposing and 19 % uncertain . 
  [ 9 ]   in march 2016 , research conducted by the royal commonwealth society indicated that 58 % of the british public supported free movement between the uk , canada , australia and new zealand , compared to 75 % of canadians , 70 % of australians and 90 % of new zealanders . 
  [ 10 ] do n't get me wrong -- timezone , transportion cost , already harmonized regulation and product standards and convenience-of-travel all favor eu integration , and it seems to me that not activating article 50 and continuing eu membership , simply finding a political route to set aside article 50 , would make more sense from a standpoint of uk trade and in maximizing flexibility of the uk 's labor market . 
  but if that 's not going to happen , this becomes another option . 
  the uk voting for brexit hurt the eu because of the previously-not-anticipated-by-the-market prospect of article 50 being initiated and the uk actually leaving . 
  even aside from the other negatives , forcing that negative outcome would n't buy much for the eu . 
  well , he was in office during the bulk of the negotiations , but clinton was in before it went through and could have halted it had he actually wanted to do so . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement  in the u.s. , bush , who had worked to `` fast track '' the signing prior to the end of his term , ran out of time and had to pass the required ratification and signing of the implementation law to incoming president bill clinton . 
  you 're right , though ... i should n't have said `` neogtiated '' . 
  i was trying to highlight the difference between political positions in campaigning and in office and was using the terms loosely . 
   i reckon what they 're hoping for is that article 50 will be instigated but extended out indefinitely you mean to trigger it , but then keep extending the negotiation process ? 
  no , i do n't agree -- that would put the uk in a bad position . 
  if the uk wanted to simply stall to wait for leave voters to age out , it would be vastly more sensible for the uk to never trigger article 50 in the first place -- that keeps the uk in control of the final leave trigger , as opposed to giving every individual eu member state a final leave trigger . 
   if uk wait another while for articke 50 , the eu will trigger article 7 i doubt that the eu will do anything like this . 
  it 's not in the eu 's interests to lose the uk , nor to antagonize a neighbor even if the uk does leave , nor to start a precedent of forcing eu member countries out . 
  after the clintons negotiated nafta , and obama went after hillary on it when they were campaigning against each other in 2008 , [ hillary declared that it was flawed when negotiating against obama ] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/25/barack-obama/clinton-has-changed-on-nafta/ ) . 
  to say nothing of nafta steadily marching on under obama , for that matter . 
  i 've noticed how free trade agreements are flawed while candidates are on the campaign trail and then undergo a marked improvement once they 're in office . 
   that would take five years or so , if people keep voting as they did in the previous one . 
  that 's too long , and neither politically acceptable for leave voters nor for the eu . 
  < shrug  i 've read statements from people in the british civil service that have been steadily pushing out the earliest possible declaration date , and it 's up to `` the end of next year '' already . 
  that 's a year-and-a-half , so it 's already a third of the way there . 
  assuming that the economic effects now are n't very popular , that 's a further shift towards remaining . 
  leave has been rather-publicly withdrawing or backing down a lot of claims that were made about the benefits of leave . 
  that 's a further shift . 
  scotland has been making serious noises about independence . 
  that 's a further shift . 
  assuming that the question of leave can be moved from `` avoiding actually defining which of the available options must be taken '' , which will almost assuredly alienate more leave voters , that 's a further shift . 
  ( personally , i 'd think just nailing down which of the leave options would be actually taken would alone be sufficient to give remain a win ) . 
   we 're past the uk negotiating perks they retain their existing perks until article 50 is activated . 
  if they are looking at negotiating an agreement that is effectively-comparable to what they have now , but without the perks , it makes no sense for them -- the only responsible thing to do in that case would be for them to not activate article 50 . 
  well , if what you want is a less-competitive market for goods and services , it wo n't provide that . 
  if you want goods and services access ... the us , like the uk , is a major services provider , and trade of services within the tpp was a us concern from the beginning . 
  on the other hand , it does n't mandate freedom of movement or labor , which is something that many people in the uk were objecting to , and it would mean access to a trade bloc that 's somewhat-larger than the eu 's bloc . 
  i 'd assume that uk interests would be in building something that has the goal of fta access to the eu as well , and the us will have been harmonizing tpp with ttip for that reason . 
  that being said , i do n't know enough about the far-reaching effects involved -- some of which are probably not obvious -- to know whether it makes sense for the uk . 
  it 's one more option on the uk 's table , though . 
   the uk will trigger article 50 . 
  there 's no way around it , politically . 
  stall , wait for enough people to age out to shift the majority preference , done . 
  avoid announcing that you are going to simply not implement it . 
   the only way i can see how the uk could possibly stay would be to trigger article 50 , and then have another referendum at the end of the negotiations . 
  makes no sense for the uk -- it throws away its perks for no benefit . 
  my assumption is that this would not happen unless the eu fails to negotiate single-market access for the uk , and the agreement between the two falls back to wto rules . 
  that being said , i * also * thought that it would make more sense for the uk to be in the eu than not , and barring a no-article-50-invocation recovery , that is n't going to happen , so ... < shrug  . 
  finally , while i 'm no expert on trade agreements , i suspect that the more-radically-different economies are in an fta , the greater the potential benefits , since there 'd be a greater potential [ comparative advantage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage ) among members -- trade would provide greater returns -- and moving into east asia connects the uk up with a lot of developing economies . 
  the uk has already made recent noises about , in the absence of eu trade , linking up with china . 
  just ideas being floated currently , but if so , would wind up with a bloc consisting of all the anglosphere countries in one free trade agreement . 
  presumably wo n't happen if the uk retains single market access to europe , where it will be more-important to have common standards with the eu , though . 
  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/spcs20rsa us housing prices took about two-and-a-half years of decline to hit a bottom during the financial crisis . 
  i suspect that housing prices are kinda sticky , as most people are n't willing or able to just up and leave their primary residence . 
  a good argument for asking polling companies to also divulge their question forms along with their results . 
  helps expose [ framing effects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/framing_effect_\\ ( psychology \\ ) ) . 
  the clout of the forces there are not where the deterrent comes from , but rather from a credible claim that other forces would in turn attack .
