  it 's on par with any other major web dev framework . 
  it 's nothing magical or useless . 
  if you 're building a website , it 's just another tool . 
  if a tool is useful , you can keep using it . 
  if they avoid limiting construction , they * could * have enough housing for all , too . 
  i am not sure that the best way to purge any remaining ussr is to create a new one . 
  it 's not . 
  if the eu federalizes , eu citizenship will be comparable to us or canadian citizenship , but at the moment , it 's a political construct inside eu countries that reflects internal agreements . 
  if you gave up your uk citizenship and took eu `` citizenship '' , the rest of the world would consider you a stateless person . 
  would need the us to radically change immigration policy . 
  and retirees already where they are planning to die probably do n't want to be shuffled off across the atlantic . 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/unemployment-rate the uk presently has a relatively-low unemployment rate , though a brexit-induced recession may change that . 
  not on trade . 
  not sure about live-and-work . 
  member countries of the eu do have freedom to issue citizenships . 
  while i see this as a flaw in the system , if the uk does leave , the uk could agree to issue citizenship to eu citizens in the uk and visa versa . 
  ironically , this would also be sufficient to shift the uk vote in favor of remain ... just slightly too late . 
  what makes the eu a german organization and not a british one ? 
  even if the uk leaves the eu , you will remain in the [ council of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) , which is n't an eu institution . 
  not that i 've seen . 
  well , to be fair , they joined a different organization . 
  the dhs can not be compared to a border control agency -- it 's an umbrella agency that covers many security-related components of the us federal government . 
  [ dhs ice ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/u.s._immigration_and_customs_enforcement ) would be a better comparison , at 19k personnel . 
  it is theoretically possible for the uk to compete with indonesia and vietnam on wages , were living standards to be sufficiently cut . 
  who is the `` we '' who was calling for the current situation ? 
  nor , i 'd think , would it be a good idea to do so . 
  first , the uk not actually leaving would be a major win for the eu . 
  second , the eu intentionally did n't create a mechanism for booting out member states . 
  adding one would set a precedent for other members that membership may be stripped . 
  i 'd take a riot and assassination as a good trade for uk interests . 
  i think that it could be sold more eptly than `` we 're ignoring this '' . 
  if well-framed . 
  the us has a voting system that leads to a two-party system . 
  it 's very hard to get a viable third party , which only counts if it gets a plurality , so the best thing that you can do is bash the other big two candidate . 
  that not only wins you swing voters , but potentially drives some opposing voters to a third party . 
  education is actually more strongly correlated with voting brexit than income . 
  the queen saying `` you 're all insane '' and seizing control and pushing things back to an absolute monarchy would be par for the course this week . 
  on 1 : yeah , but if someone did want to set aside the referendum result , they presumably would n't say so , given the fact that it would politically expose them . 
  they 'd either around until there 's preference for a remain vote ( e.g. 
  when concrete options become available ) , then hold that , and say that the will of the people must be respected . 
  saying `` i 'm just going to ignore the vote '' is politically costly and unnecessary . 
  someone had better have produced some dollar estimates before adopting the regulatory restrictions that were violated or there would n't be a basis for the regulation . 
  on the other hand , two thirds do n't . 
  however , a subset of those jobs -- the most lucrative ones -- will continue to exist and will pay more . 
  that 's what protectionists are trying for -- an inefficient way for everyone else to subsidize their industry . 
  there 's no difference between the two in a market -- that statement makes no sense . 
  you can always get more by paying more , and the concept of `` enough '' is artificial -- there will never be enough people in any field to do everything that might be done . 
  that 's not counting immigration , though . 
  colonialism may have possibly been * a * factor in the [ great divergence ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_divergence ) , but if so , it was not a dominant one . 
  the us never had substantial colonies , and was herself a colony in the era when wealth was being extracted from colonies . 
  ditto for canada . 
  switzerland never had colonies , nor did many other european countries . 
  germany was not a major colonizer . 
  should embrace it at the eu level to solidify identity and get / r/yurop looking like / r/murica !, 
  i realize that the author is trying to make a political point , but [ this should have been a per-capita map ] ( https://xkcd.com/1138/ ) , not a count of total number of people . 
  odd . 
  i thought swedes stayed [ at arms length ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/06/europe/germany-cologne-assaults-arms-length/ ) from everyone else . 
  hmm . 
  * republics are less-democratic than direct democracies . 
  * countries with constitutions that bind majority vote are less-democratic than those without ( though to be fair , the uk does n't have a constitution ) * in some ways , a [ presidential system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidential_system ) is less-democratic than a [ parliamentary system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentary_system ) , since you can not recall your executive leader . 
  in all of those ways , the us is less-democratic than it might be ... yet i do n't feel that it should change on those points . 
  and i do n't think of the us as being fascist ( at least not in some way inherent to the system ... i suppose that you could have fascist political movements show up ) . 
  could you describe the concern in concrete terms ? 
  like , what areas and degree of regulation do you want to eliminate ? 
  i mean , you could establish a free-trade bloc a la nafta or a customs union , but if you want something with the degree of integration in the eu , you 're going to be looking at regulation . 
  now , you may not * want * that integration ... 
  does the uk have issues with untreated sewage ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  that 's what the eu is . 
  i mean , the bar is lower than between switzerland and the uk , but by global standards , the eu is quite well-to-do . 
   why would any swiss person want to move to uk ? 
  the cost-of-living in switzerland is about twice that in the uk . 
  if you get a job that lets you work remotely , your wages are effectively higher , and it 's only two-and-a-half hours by air for those occasional meetings . 
  working in a major export industry is not normally what i 'd think of as a class system . 
   as someone who has dealt with home office processes , nobody is at risk of deportation . 
  if your in , you are in and fine . 
  they will establish a cut off date and not apply any new rules retrospectively . 
  that is what i guessed , as i believe it to be in the interests of the uk ( as well as other eu members with overseas uk citizens ) . 
  however , i also never believed that the uk would split off the eu , which seems to me to be counter to uk interests , and certainly the barrier is lower here . 
  i would say that it is the most-common outcome , but certainly it is not something that i would ignore in my future planning . 
  it is certainly possible for things to go south . 
  i do n't know how you use it in the netherlands , but in the us , i 've seen no real concrete distinction between the terms other than that `` neoliberalism '' has a negative connotation -- it 's a political term . 
  this is in contrast with `` neoconservativism '' , which contrasts with `` paleoconservativism '' in that neoconservativism is internationalist . 
  the united states is n't a cocaine producer -- we are a cocaine consumer , and intercept it inbound , just like the eu does . 
  we just [ happen to be one hop away from production via shipping ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib7gdsqyapo ) . 
  the us is wealthier than the eu , and it took a lot of kicking and screaming for us to agree to take even 10k syrians this year ... and we actually did less than half that rate so far this year . 
  also , the uk is one of the most , if not the most economically-liberal countries in the eu , and they wo n't have less-liberal eu influence . 
  [ cocaine purity in the european union is quite low by global cocaine standards , at least as of these decade-old measurements ] ( https://www.unodc.org/pdf/wdr_2006/wdr2006_chap5_cocaine.pdf ) . 
  you 're saying that you 're a cocaine user who wants more cocaine in the us ? 
  that 's not how it works . 
  [ cocaine is a south american product ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/colombia/11989635/colombia-overtakes-peru-to-be-the-worlds-largest-producer-of-cocaine.html ) -- anything in romania is n't going to the us . 
  no healthcare subsidies for the bulk of the public !, 
  well , theoretically the public might . 
  we 're not going to do a referendum on it , though . 
  welcome aboard !, 
  well , for people who wanted cheaper london housing ... this is certainly likely to achieve that , as it 'll clobber the real estate market . 
  seems like it would have been vastly easier to just lift height limits on building , though . 
  fwiw , the us also has no way to remove a head of the executive early other than via impeachment -- they have to have committed a serious crime . 
  i expect some of the brits rather feel the same way . 
  worked for about the last 1.2 billion years .
