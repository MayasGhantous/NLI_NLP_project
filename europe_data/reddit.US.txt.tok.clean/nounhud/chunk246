  well , if it is n't , that 's how cities grow , after all -- people wanting to move there . 
   many are turning against globalization and things it entails : that is first and foremost immigration , also , to a lesser extent , free trade . 
  hmm . 
  you 're talking about external-to-the-eu or internal-to-the-eu immigration ? 
  because while i know that the uk is feeling swamped ... i have n't seen people from other countries here complaining about internal immigration . 
   also , to a lesser extent , free trade . 
  look at the resistance there is against ttip . 
  people do n't trust it . 
  there are certain industries that i hear about that certainly are affected , most-obviously small french farms . 
  given other articles i 've seen about protests , destruction of agricultural goods being shipped past french borders , and so forth , i [ assume that the process of having small farms go out of business is underway in france as well ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-economy-agriculture-secret-anguish-of-the-french-farmer/ ) :  in her village , 25 percent of locals now vote for the national front . 
  van der ploeg disapproves , but says there is no longer any `` respect for the work that we are doing . '' in 10 years , she predicts , `` it will all be gone . '' ... `` we are digging our own grave , '' he says . 
  `` if the transatlantic treaty [ ttip ] goes through , most of the agriculture sector will be destroyed . 
  so i can understand that upset ( though i also predict it , and i 'd call it a move that will make society better-off ) . 
  but outside those areas ? 
  i would think that countries with lower labor costs in the eu would tend to favor having market access -- the article mentioned cheaper-than-french polish meat . 
  i still think that that was mostly because it was something ( anything ) that could embarrass him rather than because people were into the sex side . 
  and given that in the end , people got more fed up with people hounding him than the actual act , kinda backfired anyway . 
  page 3 as well ? 
  hmm . 
  i suppose that 's testable . 
  while there 's obviously political bias and all that involved ( e.g. 
  the ones ranked highly appear to tend to be progressives ) , there are people who have [ attempted to rank us presidents ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_united_states ) . 
  we can use an aggregate ranking . 
  here 's a [ list of believed presidential affairs ] ( http://www.rantpolitical.com/2014/11/12/15-presidents-who-were-rumored-to-have-mistresses/ ) . 
  assuming that there 's no correlation between having an affair and doing badly as a president , i 'd expect an average rank of about 22 . 
  in practice , we get 18.28 -- that is , cheating presidents were ranked slightly higher than non-ranking presidents . 
  okay , as a general principle , fine , but ... sex of middle-aged , overweight , unglamorous politicians ? 
  i 'm still not convinced that the issue is poverty . 
  it 's plausible , and thus far , * the guardian * has written a number of articles providing an that as an explanation ... but that 's also what i 'd think they 'd put in their articles anyway . 
  you know the `` this goes to just show what i 'd be arguing for anyway '' thing . 
  http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/06/brexit-vote-statistics-united-kingdom-european-union/488780/ income * is * correlated with voting for brexit . 
  but it 's much-less-strongly-so than degree of education . 
  the more-educated your region is , the more it wants remain . 
  unfortunately , * the atlantic * does n't give us the correlation coefficient , so we have to eyeball it , but it 's pretty clear ( and they comment on the fact in the article ) . 
   in general , keep the us the major player in geopolitical situations in europe . 
  we do n't seem to have been able to do much other than unsuccessfully campaign for voters to vote `` remain '' here . 
   this because they feel that is how europe ( and the eu by extension ) will keep adhering to the ideologies the paper adheres . 
  you mean * the economist * ? 
  you mean that the us wants to remain associated with europe because it believes that will cause europe to keep adhering to a market economy , capitalism , free trade , that sort of thing ? 
  i mean ... i think that internal factors are probably more-significant there , and ... would you see europe again raising trade borders between its countries or moving to state-run economies again ? 
  there does n't seem to be much public support for that sort of thing . 
   that 's just my idea of it : nato and atlanticism work because the european nations are the lesser allies . 
  < headscratch  so ... let 's hypothetically say that nato countries in europe spent as much on their militaries as nato countries in north america do . 
  you mean that the two would no longer work together ? 
  `` will this make me prime minister ? '', 
  ... actually , come to think of it ... that really was n't addressed either . 
   unless britain finds a way to undo its decision to leave the european union , london 's days as the pre-eminent global financial capital , ranked even ahead of new york , may be numbered . 
    i spoke this week to several high-ranking executives at major financial institutions that collectively employ tens of thousands in london . 
  while none of them have any immediate plans to move their european headquarters from britain 's capital , all agreed they would eventually shift a significant number of highly paid employees to cities that remain in the european union . 
    one executive in charge of relocation ( who like the others , spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the issue ) said the percentage of employees in his firm who might be required to move ranged from 10 percent to 40 percent . 
  `` multiply that throughout the industry and it 's tens of thousands of people and their families , '' he said . 
  `` and bear in mind that most of these people are millionaires . '' i wonder if there 's enough information about ultimate losses coming out to provide estimates for the kind of service cuts that can be expected if brexit goes through . 
  the us federal government has not bailed out state governments . 
  i think that it 's bad for the eu , but if you wanted less-liberal economic policy -- and some here do -- it 'll probably send things in that direction . 
   firm control could you expand on that ? 
  to take advantage of the tax system of the eu that can pass regulation that you wo n't have input on ? 
  i 'm no expert , but seems like there might be difficulty there . 
  you may consider it an insult , but i think that many would be honored to be considered like him . 
  thanks , canada !,

   unless the freedom party pvv wins an absolute majority , this will never happen . 
  as i understand it , the netherlands has both the [ initiative ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/initiative ) and the [ referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendum ) ( hence the [ dutch ukraine-european union association agreement referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_ukraine%e2%80%93european_union_association_agreement_referendum,_2016 ) recently ) . 
  i assume that means that it would be possible to initiate a referendum . 
  in the uk , the government would never have chosen to leave -- it was only a referendum that would pull the uk out . 
  i do n't know what dutch approval of the eu is like at the moment ( though really , the question is how low the troughs are -- the brexit vote happened in a trough of support ) . 
  just as with the uk , this would be non-binding , but would the dutch government be willing to override the results of such a referendum ? 
  let 's say that you 're lukashenko . 
  the eu is opposed to your form of government . 
  there 's going to be a limited degree to which you can side with the eu before the eu is going to want policies that will likely put you out of a job . 
  i 'd think that un positions probably already have been traded , albeit privately . 
  unsc vetoes would be a hell of a substantial position , though . 
   is the us administration using potential future investment by us corporations as a carrot/stick in the hopes of influencing eu action on brexit ? 
  the us administration does n't direct investment by us corporations , so , no . 
  the bit that explicitly raises the possibility of brexit not going through is interesting , though . 
   who the heck would want to align with russia , a country that is insanely corrupt and poor ? 
  that 's all relative . 
  [ russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia ) 's estimated 2016 per-capita nominal gdp is $ 7,742 . 
  that 's not good by europe 's standards , but [ belarus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belarus ) 's estimated 2016 per-capita nominal gdp is $ 4,855 . 
  eh , that 's just the ( admittedly successful ) rhetoric that he used . 
  does n't mean that he believes it . 
  * have * until article 50 triggers and subsequent negotiations are complete . 
   vote ukip if you want a labour government '' . 
  it was just the dismissals and the leadership challenge earlier , but within the last 24 hours , [ apparently some labour members have started trying get legal access to use the party name and split the party ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/anti-corbyn-labour-mps-plan-breakaway-group-in-parliament ) . 
  not sure that labour being viable would be a good thing to rely on . 
  eh , i guess i 'll concede that point . 
  heinz was founded and is headquartered in the us , but it [ has uk production facilities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heinz#united_kingdom ) . 
  why not both ? 
  give 'em a quick political marriage and adopt 'em into the royal family . 
  it would n't be the most-bizarre thing to happen this week . 
   they 're both anti public owned anything well , that sounds pretty good ...  and both anti-privacy that does n't . 
  i hear that he likes doing `` real '' work . 
   a party bases their program on not respecting the results of the referendum and wins [ the liberal democrats have done that already ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-result-lib-dems-remain-liberal-democrats-live-policy-stay-leave-a7103186.html ) . 
  ehhh ... 
  i do n't think that that 's my issue with referendums . 
  i mean , let 's say that you had representatives do the vote .
