  this was the recent finding of an elaborate simulation study by rand , the renowned u.s. think tank . 
    nato 's only option would be to attempt a reconquest . 
  but rand predicts that this would end `` in disaster . '', 
  the nato battalions would be far inferior in numbers to the armored troops of russia and could n't even counter with combat tanks . 
  from the highly armed port garrison of kaliningrad , the russian army could keep warships from entering the baltic and could direct heavy artillery fire against the suwalki corridor . 
    `` by and large , '' concludes the rand study , `` nato infantry would n't even be able to retreat . 
  it would be destroyed on the spot . '', 
    neither lt. gen. hodges nor other nato representatives dispute this analysis . 
    `` it 's true -- russia could overrun the baltic states more quickly than we would be there to defend them , '' he says . 
  they may be arguing for better military funding ( which may be a great idea ) , but the argument here does n't seem to to really a good one . 
  in some hypothetical war with russia , where russia invades a nato member and does not escalate to nuclear war , i 'm sure that russia would manage to get into eastern europe . 
  but ... that 's kind of missing the point . 
  this is n't because nato is militarily-incapable of fighting russia . 
  nor is it because nato 's blind as to risks . 
  it 's because someone who successfully surprise-attacks is going to get the first whack . 
  that 's just a constraint that you have to live with -- you have to survive the first attack without being knocked out . 
  i 'm guessing , since nato war plans wo n't be publicly-available , but : nato has [ strategic depth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_depth ) . 
  russia could , hypothetically , invade and occupy parts of eastern europe . 
  but russia could not handle doing the same with europe and the us . 
  that means that russia winds up with an air war on its hands . 
  until the air defenses that russia can move in are destroyed , they can move with some freedom . 
  but unless you think that russia can prevent nato from achieving air superiority , before long there are going to be bombs falling on russian ground forces . 
  in past recent wars that the us has taken part in , the rough outline has been to wipe out the other side 's air defenses , then to use aircraft to destroy important ground targets , then to use ground forces last . 
  during that time , russian ground forces would indeed get into the baltics . 
  but that does n't render nato ineffective , and this is not because nato does n't intend to fight over the baltics . 
  the us [ had war plans for defending us soil ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_washtub_\\ ( united_states \\ ) ) that involved falling back and then re-taking land . 
  rather , it 's that it 's not very realistic to stop a first blow in its tracks . 
  same thing happened in the phillippines in world war ii . . and as the rand report points out , attacking simply puts russia in an unwinnable war . 
  finally , while i 'm not sure that i agree with it , the [ rand report in question ] ( http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/rr1200/rr1253/rand_rr1253.pdf ) has already been discussed here . 
  its recommendation was the addition of something like 35k soldiers , including armor , to the area :  fortunately , avoiding such a swift and catastrophic failure does not appear to require a herculean effort . 
  further gaming indicates that a force of about seven brigades , including three heavy armored brigades -- adequately supported by airpower , land-based fires , and other enablers on the ground and ready to fight at the onset of hostilities -- could suffice to prevent the rapid overrun of the baltic states . 
  while not sufficient to mount a sustained defense of the region or to achieve nato 's ultimate end state of restoring its members ' territorial integrity , such a posture would fundamentally change the strategic picture as seen from moscow . 
  instead of being able to confront nato with a stunning coup de main that cornered it as described above , an attack on the baltics would instead trigger a prolonged and serious war between russia and a materially far wealthier and more powerful coalition , a war moscow must fear it would be likely to lose . 
  crafting this deterrent posture would not be inexpensive in absolute terms , with annual costs perhaps running on the order of $ 2.7 billion . 
  that is not a small number , but seen in the context of an alliance with an aggregate gross domestic product in excess of $ 35 trillion and combined yearly defense spending of more than $ 1 trillion , it hardly appears unaffordable , especially in comparison with the potential costs of failing to defend nato 's most exposed and vulnerable allies -- that is , of potentially inviting a devastating war , rather than deterring it . 
  there may be good reasons to increase garrison forces in europe . 
  it may decrease the area lost to initial attacks . 
  but i do n't think that the right way to describe the situation is `` nato is weak and helpless against russia '' . 
   obama said british eu membership strengthened their special relationship , i certainly do n't think that there was an implication that one depended on the other . 
  it 's been recorded , so [ we can fact-check ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pelstgbrock ) and see precisely what he said :  i think it 's fair to say that maybe at some point down the line there might be a uk-us agreement , but it 's not gon na happen anytime soon because our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc -- the european union -- to get a trade agreement done , and the uk is gon na be at the back of the queue . 
  not because we do n't have a special relationship , but because given the heavy lift on any trade agreement , us having access to a big market with a lot of countries rather than trying to do piecemeal trade agreements is hugely-inefficient . 
  no claim of the relationship being dependent upon eu membership . 
  all that being said , there 's a heavy dose of politics here . 
  i expect that cameron asked him to make a statement to the uk 's public to undercut leave 's claim that there were trade deals and lots of wealth just waiting to be unlocked once the uk could negotiate its own trade deals . 
  and the republican follow-up here is from legislators who see a way to thus portray obama as being anti-british and go after him for that reason . 
  * cameron adds 3 month delay to stabilize things , and insists that he is not the right person to initiate article 50 . http://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/oliver-letwin-completely-unsuitable-to-lead-brexit-unit-says-former-cabinet-secretary/  turnbull also told the committee that article 50 should not be triggered before next year , given the amount of preparation required : `` there 's a lot of work to get through between now and september 2 -- a new cabinet , a new front bench , they have to get themselves into their jobs and then get down to the details of the trading arrangements ; issues of passporting ; movement of people , the juxtaposition of if you want the single market access you have to have free movement of people . 
  * okay , so that 's six months , up to next year  he also warned against conducting brexit negotiations at a time when france and germany will be holding general elections next year , because `` we do n't want to trigger it and find mrs merkel does n't want to talk to us because she has bigger fish to fry at home . '' * unless i 'm misunderstanding him and he 's saying that the brexit negotiations would be completed in six months ( which i assume is not the case ) , that probably means after the general elections , so that 's another year-and-a-quarter at least until one could even possibly consider initiating article 50 ... and we 're not even a week after the referendum . 
  on an entirely-unrelated note , [ a * yes , minister * quote from sir humphrey appleby about the effect of initial setup and general elections on schedule ] ( http://moksheungming.tripod.com/yes.html ) :  humphrey 's system for stalling . 
  according to tom , it 's in five stages . 
  i made a note during our conversation , for future reference . 
  stage one : humphrey will say that the administration is in its early months and there 's an awful lot of other things to get on with . 
  stage two : if i persist past stage one , he 'll say that he quite appreciates the intention , something certainly ought to be done -- but is this the right way to achieve it ? 
  stage three : if i 'm still undeterred he will shift his ground from how i do it to when i do it , i.e. 
  ` minister , this is not the time , for all sorts of reasons . ', 
  stage four : lots of ministers settle for stage three according to tom . 
  but if not , he will then say that the policy has run into difficulties -- technical , political and/or legal . 
  ( legal difficulties are best because they can be made totally incomprehensible and can go on for ever . ), 
  stage five : finally , because the first four stages have taken up to three years , the last stage is to say that ` we 're getting rather near to the run-up to the next general election -- so we ca n't be sure of getting the policy through ' . 
  i do n't know how much trade negotiation expertise is specific to a country 's laws , but i would n't be surprised if it is n't a lot . 
  really , though , this does n't seem like an insurmountable issue . 
  at no point did he say that brexit would cause the special relationship to end . 
  now , granted , it 's all political terminology anyway , but just for correctness ... 
  there 's no reason that juncker or another eu figure ca n't be the official face , regardless of what work countries are doing privately . 
  hell , it 's going to be bureaucrats doing the work anyway -- it 's not as if merkel is personally doing it , but being the public face of it . 
  it would be entirely-possible for her to be invisible from a public standpoint on eu issues , and for eu figures to be the ones speaking on it . 
  when you have a press conference and merkel or merkel and hollande are the only ones present , it , not surprisingly , gives the public watching impression that these countries are the ones dominating things internally , regardless of what work has actually happened or whether any other country actually * had * any sort of objection . 
  part of being a public figure is deciding where * not * to show up , not just when to show up . 
  for good or for ill , merkel 's job is to look out for germany 's interests . 
  she symbolizes that . 
  i think that when she is the one presenting eu positions , it perhaps does n't create the intended image to have a subset of eu member state leaders doing that presentation , even if eu member states did work on the issue . 
  now , i have n't seen polls on a list of concerns about the eu . 
  i 'm just going off what people post here , on an english-language form that is doubtless , in many ways , not representative of the eu 's population . 
  but i * do * see a bunch of people grousing about german domination , and i wonder if that is predominately an effect of the number of public appearances being done . 
  well , robots have been doing once-human things for a long time . 
  i mean , that 's what the [ industrial revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrial_revolution ) was in significant part about : using fossil fuels to drive machines to replace hand labor . 
  it is [ what turned europe into the outstanding portion of the world that it became ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_divergence ) . 
  while it 's not , technically , what we normally call a [ robot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robot ) in that it 's not mechanical , i 've a favorite perspective-altering point . 
  everyone here knows what i talk about when i say `` computer '' . 
  and yet ... that 's not what the term once meant . 
  not that long ago , the term referred to a [ human profession ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_computer ) that is now so dead that even the name has mostly vanished into the sands of history . 
  every vending machine , automated phone system , atm , website , and so forth is doing something that would once have been done by a human . 
  if you 've a fan blowing on you on this june day ... well there was a [ point in time when a human would have had to do so ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punkah_wallah ) ( and only the wealthy could afford this ) . 
  so , really , it 's here now . 
  and , yeah , there are n't humanoid robots walking down the street ... but there are self-driving cars running around , software that can do a pretty good job of recognizing people , and a lot of other fairly-sophisticated problems being solved . 
  we are n't to [ artificial general intelligence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artificial_general_intelligence ) yet -- while we have general ai in the form of things like [ neural nets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artificial_neural_network ) , it 's so incredibly inefficient that it 's only suitable to solve the most primitive of problems , and can not , at least without fundamental changes , scale up to solve human-level problems . 
  but we can replace a lot of human jobs without requiring that -- that 's just a point where we can all agree that we 'd effectively be * superseded * by ai , so it 's a good starting point about how to restructure society . 
  this mixes together a lot of unrelated concerns , which i think are very broad and really should be dealt with separately : * the idea of adding some sort of tax on robots to offset the negative externality of loss of human labor . ', 
  immediate , practical , short-term policy decision . 
  i am dubious that this is a good idea , but it 's certainly a short-term issue . 
  * registration of robots ( which i guess is * kind * of related to the above ) . 
  * concern over the prospect that the [ technological singularity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technological_singularity ) is imminent . 
  this is a broad philosophical concern , and not yet one for policymakers beyond possibly funding research . 
  this is actually an area that may deserve serious international funding , even though it will provide no return until we actually have artificial general intelligence , since ( a ) we have very good reason to believe that we * will * at some point , and ( b ) the consequences of not having already-decided policy in place at that point may be really catastrophic . 
  for further reading , see [ friendly ai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friendly_artificial_intelligence ) -- the study of trying to figure out how the heck to `` constrain '' an ai in a way to make it be helpful rather than harmful to humanity . 
  the question is [ surprisingly difficult ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/instrumental_convergence#paperclip_maximizer ) . 
  i have wondered whether a failure to successfully develop successful policy to ensure friendly ai might be the answer to the [ fermi paradox ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fermi_paradox ) , in the `` it is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself '' category . 
  note that i think that much of the practical work to be done here looks more like what computer science ( or perhaps mathematics ) would deal with -- unfortunately , most of the work i 've seen done on it has been rather-disappointing-and-not-very-rigorous works that do n't contribute much of a foundation beyond rephrasing the problem . 
  there * may * need to be some sort of policy framework in place to make sure that people actually do work with ai safely . 
  * basic income . 
  while ai does interact with this in some ways , i think that this is a huge other policy and should not directly be tied to questions of ai , but to something like unemployment and broad decisions about planning society .
