  given humanity 's tendency in the past to [ mis-predict structural unemployment due to technological advance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luddites ) , i suspect that we may well be mis-predicting it here , as well -- could happen some day , but then again , we might also be having this same debate under the same conditions two hundred years from now . 
  * ethics/morality of ai/robotics . 
  huge , broad question . 
  my own take is that it 's a non-issue , a [ semantic dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semantic_dispute ) . 
  on the issue of friendly ai , i 'm interested in the idea of international cooperation . 
  like climate change , space debris , meteorite impacts , and nuclear disarmament , it is an issue that can have global effect . 
  the idea of working to solve problems in a technology that does n't even * exist * yet seems discouraging , but i think that a very compelling argument has been made that we may be in a very bad position if we have n't already figured out friendly ai by the time that we develop artificial general intelligence . 
   oceania fyi , [ this is a real term , though it means something else ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oceania ) . 
   i mean if us can live with 2 weeks of paid vacation/year others can do it too . 
  that 's [ just a common amount for when first joining a company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_minimum_annual_leave_by_country ) . 
  the us has no floor on what employers and employees agree on -- if both employer and employee like it , they can agree to it :  there is no statutory minimum paid vacation or paid public holidays . 
  it is left to the employers to offer paid vacation . 
  [ 130 ] according to the us bureau of labor statistics , 77 % of private employers offer paid vacation to their employees ; full-time employees earn on average 10 vacation days after one year of service . 
  [ 131 ] similarly , 77 % of private employers give their employees paid time off during public holidays , on average 8 holidays per year . 
  [ 131 ] [ 132 ] some employers offer no vacation at all . 
  [ 133 ] the average number of paid vacation days offered by private employers is 10 days after 1 year of service , 14 days after 5 years , 17 days after 10 years , and 20 days after 20 years . 
  see , if you had started with * that * about twenty years back and got your * hoi polloi * cheering for that , would n't be having this sort of brexit business . 
  < looks at the leave points and comparing to the discussion of problems in the claims  * 350m pounds/week claim . 
  that 's been gone-over -- that 's not the dominant factor . 
  * `` we 'll be in charge of our own borders : in a world with so many new threats , it 's safer to control our own borders and decide for ourselves who can come into this country , not be overruled by eu judges '' . 
  the echr is n't an eu institution ( though the eu might make it harder for a member nation to withdraw ) . 
  the refugee convention long predated the eu . 
  it 's true that redistribution within the eu may not come up . 
  * `` we can control immigration : and have a fairer system which welcomes people to the uk based on the skills they have , not the passport they hold '' okay , that 's true ... you can exclude poles , romanians , etc * if * you 're going to also give up single market access . 
  and it * could * affect people who come from outside the eu to the eu and are given citizenship there , like refugees to sweden and germany . 
  i personally think that there should be some degree of eu coordination on from-outside-the-eu immigration , even if it 's just a brake , and that does n't exist . 
  i 'll give this one a legitimate point , as long as it is paired with the economic consequences of doing so . 
  * `` we 'll be free to trade with the whole world : the eu stops us signing our own trade deals with key allies like australia and new zealand and growing economies like india , china , or brazil '' . 
  true , though if you take this route , you 're out of the customs union and back to a free trade only agreement . 
  which may be fine , but i think that that 's not what a lot of people are envisioning . 
  and the eu * can * sign agreements with these people -- while you 've got people who do try to object to free trade agreements in the eu ( there 's clearly some folks on here who are arguing over ttip at the moment , for example , but the eu has managed to get through [ many free trade agreements already ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) ) , it 's not clear to me that the brits negotiate worse trade agreements or that negotiating a deal with nz or au is * that * difficult for the eu . 
  * `` we can make our own laws : our laws should be made by people we can elect and kick out -- that 's more democratic '' you already can only vote for one representative in a pool of many . 
  this does the same thing , simply with a pool that 's about eight times larger . 
  * `` turkey is one of five new countries joining the eu '' . 
  maybe eventually . 
  * `` the eu will cost us more and more '' -- the chart shows an * aggregate * rather than the rate of flow . 
  the eu is a net positive in terms of gdp for the uk . 
  * `` we 'll have to keep bailing out the euro '' -- the uk had a special exemption to avoid the euro , and when it did provide funds ( which i agree was a really-politically-bad-idea , since they were guaranteed that this would n't happen ) , they had a special guarantee where them getting paid back had higher priority than anyone else . 
  * `` the european court will still be in charge of our laws '' . 
  probably it has some influence . 
  i 've no expertise here . 
  the uk has also signed onto treaties and other international agreements that constrain its laws . 
  i mean , that 's a list of the most-compelling arguments that leave could produce , and they 're * really * weak . 
  i would expect that she would n't be particularly concerned about whether economic activity comes from a 50 person company or from a 50,000 person company . 
  it 's just economic activity ... 
  also , the [ morgenthau plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morgenthau_plan ) ( proposed by a jewish-american who was severely-pissed-off at nazi germany ) was seriously damaging to us interests in germany . 
  being a hard-ass when it 's not appropriate can be harmful . 
  ah , fair enough . 
  reading the thread had led me to a different impression :     i 'm forced to hope that this will be very , very painful for the uk in the short and in the long run so the nationalist in the remaining member states wo n't ever be able to point at the uk as a success story . 
        ca n't we for one be a bit more emphatic instead of talking like generals of the prussian army ? 
  the brits are about to quit , that 's their decision , even if i find it regrettable . 
  no need to wish them pain . 
  let 's hope it works out for them and maybe some day they come knocking again . 
      but that 's the problem with that argument : if it works out for them , they have no reason to come knocking again . 
  and then :  again , i have never said anyone should take any action against the uk . 
  but removing their eu member privileges has to happen , or there simply is no point of being a member - that 's all . 
  i think that a number of people , including myself , got a different impression . 
  fair enough . 
   new pm and government , negotiate for a reform deal to entire eu instead of just uk-eu relationship , put that up against leave . 
  or , simpler -- actually negotiate a leave package and put it up against remain and put * that * up for referendum . 
  i do n't think that there is any single package that can win majority support , assuming voters understand the actual implications . 
  the referendum had leave win because it had one option that was * all * leave-based options combined against a single remain ... and leave * still * barely won . 
  reduce leave to a single option , so that either the `` i do n't want large-scale immigration '' or the `` i do n't want the british economy to go down in a flaming heap '' crowd no longer supports it , and you 've a winning remain referendum . 
  that 's not dishonest -- that 's the actual choice that voters have to make , since they only get to choose one of them . 
   but that 's the problem with that argument : if it works out for them , they have no reason to come knocking again . 
  then there 's no point in the eu as a voluntary union , yes ? 
  and let 's say that you kick the legs out from under the uk , as perhaps could be done . 
  then you permanently and immediately own any failings that happen . 
  perhaps you do n't send tanks into london , but the damage has been done -- while on paper , countries can leave , you have * de facto * rescinded that promise . 
  my guess is that one day , if the eu continues integration , article 50 will be removed . 
  but today , that is not the structure that the eu has , and until then , the credibility of the eu was placed behind the lisbon treaty . 
  the goal behind the creators of the eu was that it was possible to create a * mutually-advantageous * union , where countries would want to join . 
  you have , in significant degree , succeeded -- in fact , the ( aware of the implications ) leadership of the uk does * not * want to leave and thinks that leaving is a poor idea . 
  and how blind do you think that other european countries are ? 
  supposing that the brits * could * truly have done well , but do not because the eu interferes . 
  then the watching countries know , and the object lesson becomes useless , since they know that the brits did n't * really * fail -- it becomes simply a threat against countries not to leave . 
  you do n't need an elaborate facade for that -- if you think that that is the right way to run the eu , simply modify the lisbon treaty to read `` we will punish any country that leaves in the following x ways '' . 
  just because a country is n't part of you does n't mean that it is n't advantageous . 
  the us and canada have maintained a friendly relationship for a long time . 
  there are plenty of other examples of neighboring countries that have perfectly-productive , valuable relationships . 
  if you seek to harm your neighbor , you wo n't have a friend next door . 
  what she said here is , i assume , written up by folks in the bureaucracy under her , not her personally , though -- she 's just presenting the points . 
  * she gets out and makes public and firm that it is not possible to achieve the disparate set of promises that the brexit crowd had been promising . 
  that politically removes their legs from under them from the get-go . 
  * she uses friendly terminology , to help avoid a schism -- it 's hard to plant a boot in the face of someone who just called you `` friend '' and `` family '' . 
  * she makes the eu not the initiator of a split -- it 's on the uk to initiate . 
  * she politically shifts authority for the split from the referendum -- which had an undesirable outcome for the eu -- to the article 50 invocation , which is a matter for the government . 
  there was a similar , anonymous quote ( not from her , but same idea ) in a guardian story earlier about `` if the british want to treat the referendum as a non-event , we will also treat it as a non-event '' . 
  it was written in a way that has a nice double-meaning -- it came off as acting somewhat annoyed that the brits have indecision ( popular at home ) , but also explicitly gives them room to not actually go through with the referendum . 
  * she earlier advocated for `` a time to calm down and let cooler heads prevail '' . 
  * she mentioned not-at-risk ties , to help keep people from thinking in an `` us '' and `` them '' fashion . 
   the us already struggling to convince some eu members of the value of ttip , would scuttle the deal for good . 
  i doubt it . 
  politicians have made rather public statements because it 's unpopular with the public and they can score some points over it . 
  if governments actually felt that it was disadvantageous to them , they would n't be negotiating it . 
  if it becomes necessary , might be that it gets broken up into agreements with separate names or whatever to let public figures who want to do so say that they stopped it . 
   hillary has been forced to backtrack on free trade . 
  i have n't been paying attention to her campaign , but as far as i can tell from a skim , she 's avoided any concrete commitments that would interfere with free trade . 
  frankly , i suspect that most of the concerns from leave were about money too , albeit in the form of wage pressures . 
   federation like the us and canada still have states and provinces but the final say is federal , no , that is not true at all .
